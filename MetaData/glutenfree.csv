1361142107.0,18prxt,Being Gluten free at disney is a piece of cake,ChloeMonster,146,17,40,"I have been gfree for 5 years. 

I have started going to Epcot for my birthday which is around the food and wine festival and disney usually can help produce a list that makes it easy to pick from. (Cross contamination usually doesn't effect me that much as that is super helpful)

But last June

So when I made my way this year for valentines day I braced myself when I ordered my burger. The cast member who was taking my order (at the tall tale burger place) asked if it was an allergy and I said yes he told me to stand aside. All I could think of when he called an allergy on the walkie talkie was another ordeal  that I dealt with last year. 

I cold only be wrong. They had a cook come out and ask me my allergy. I told him gfree and i would just like a burger no bun. He surprised me

Everything so amazing! They had a separate area where they took care of their food. I was so happy to see that they took my health issues as serious as shell fish or peanuts. 

But that wasn't it some how I magically gotten into be our guest. The gfree options they have are amazing.

Just thought people might like to know that if they travel to disney in just one year there has been such an improvement for people who are gfree. All you have to do is ask and you'll get wonderful care.

I've read in many posts, I apologize. Last week, I actually got in an argument with my own physician. On day 2 of going GF, I had an appointment to check on my migraine status. I told her that I was cutting gluten, and she looked at me like I was a crazy person and informed me that there was no reason to try such a thing; that I was just depriving myself. I politely told her I believed it would and that I had the research to back it up. I couldn't believe it! So now, sadly, I've experienced what many of you have, well

As I said in my former post, but nothing substantial. It's up to us to do the research, and sadly, most of us just don't take the time. I still have much to learn. So I thank you guys for educating me, and changing my views. (not that I was anti-GF, I just never *completely* understood it)",,,,

I would wake up in the morning with staggering pain inside my lower and upper abdomen. When I'm talking about staggering pain I'm not saying 'tolerable pain'

I'm talking about the kind of pain that made me prostate

Other than pain I would have frequent diarrhea, lethargy, high blood pressure, high glucose (borderline diabetes).


Day after day my suffering went on, (for the first 4 years). Doctors couldn't figure out what the fuck was wrong with me, and they did every exam in the book (save for celiac).


I became depressive, quit 3 different colleges, didn't take anything seriously because I figured I was dying. And I went to so many doctors that they started telling me it was all in my head. I was losing my mind.

But I didn't give up, epidemiology, histology, handbook of symptoms, etc). I studied day and night, trying to make a connection between my symptoms &amp; a possible cause. For a while I was sure I had Fibromyalgia, but that's something women get so I crossed that off. 

Then I started making a connection to everything that causes Malabsorption, problem solved? No, I had to prove it, so I wrote everything down using medical jargon and took it to a different doctor. I gave him my paper, he read, ""Makes sense, let's do a biopsy to confirm"" was his answer. I was happy beyond belief.

I was addicted to blood pressure medication, suffered alone in silence, and I finally had my answer to prove 'em all wrong. Joke's on me though. Took me more than 5 years to do so.

So my whole life has been filled with watching portion sizes and trying to work out more and counting calories and *dieting* and **never** seeing much in the way of results. Still

After a couple years in college something happened. I dropped a lot of weight and I wasn't sure how I'd done it, I was the most active I'd ever been. 

After about nine months of steadily gaining weight I gave up. I gave in. I just stopped caring. I gained a little more weight

A couple years ago I decided it was time to fix things. I was unhappy in my marriage

Last July I decided to switch up my diet to lowish carb, then the winter holidays hit and I slack off. I accepted that I'd gain a little weight back and I'd just work it back off. I actually did really well, didn't really gain more than a couple pounds and it made me think, hey, I can just eat whatever I want in moderation. 

So I'm counting calories and including in all the things I was denying myself. Wraps, but I kept under my calories so I thought I was good. And I was for a short amount of time. 

Then I got a wicked stomach bug and everything changed. Suddenly I'm having all of these stomach problems. But I'm not sick anymore, since although I'd had stomach problems my whole life, they'd never been this bad. I get tested for all sorts of scary things that my symptoms fit and nothing is conclusive. And in the mean time I'm eating like normal and still in agony. 

A few weeks ago I made the decision to do an elimination diet. My doctor had pretty much dismissed the possibility of it being food related and wanted to send me off to more specialists and more scary stuff. But I wanted to try this first. So I start the diet and I start taking a probiotic. 

After two days my stomach pains are already better. My stool isn't the scary yellow color anymore. Not quite normal yet, so I start testing. 

I had a mild reaction to lactose, fruits, all things other family members are allergic to. Nothing. Then I test gluten. 

Holy crap it was like I was trying to pass glass. It wasn't immediate, all that bloat weight I'd been carrying. I feel like a new person again. I have so much more energy. 

Thinking about it today made me realize a few things: 
1. I've had chronic diarrhea my whole life. Cramps, often sick. Growing up pasta and chicken nuggets were my main staple foods, but when I was young I really didn't eat a ton. I was always on a calorie restrictive diet, but always overweight. 

2. I lost weight in college during a time when all I was eating was omelets

3. I started gaining weight again after I started living with my now ex-husband. After I met him my diet went from salads and protein to pasta, for the most part, but it was the gluten heavy diet that killed me. I went back to feeling crappy and fatigued and always being sick again. 

For years I've looked back on that time with guilt, I didn't have big bowls of pasta. I still ate nothing but salad for lunch. Eggs and toast for breakfast isn't that bad. 

I've come to realize that *what* I was eating really impacted my weight, because I don't want to feel like that ever again.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,

Anyway, who is a nurse told us some shocking news about Bob. She had gone on a camping trip with Bob and a large group of friends. Betty's thoughtful husband brought plenty of GF foods for Bob. He even bought GF muffins and bagels for him knowing how sick Bob gets after eating regular food. Bob, with attitude, blows off the GF foods and decides to eat regular pancakes, muffins, and whatever else everyone was eating. Even with strong reactions, Bob doesn't follow the GF diet at all and is unwilling to change his ways...that's about to change. 

So the group goes on a few hikes and afterwards Bob complains of possibly pulling a muscle around his inner thigh. A week after the camping trip Bob calls Betty
Bob goes to a hospital looking like death. His eyes have black rings around them, now crotch, is growing and the black area on his leg is expanding. 

After a few days at the hospital they find out what's going on. Bob, collecting around his crotch. He had done so much damage from eating whatever he wanted, he literally ripped a whole in his intestine. He is now septic with a tube coming out of his side. 

He came near death while in the hospital. He lost considerable weight and looked like a skeleton. Fortunately

Even recently now that gluten-free has become a big thing, to talk to about *our* problems and the shit we've been through and discuss recipes and stuff. I never found anyone who could understand me.

Now that I've found this subreddit, what other people with GI/Celiac go through. I now know what kind of experiences other people have had with this obnoxious condition and the feelings that come with it. That's all I ever wanted in my life... thank you. THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOUALLFORCOMINGHERE!!!!! I am a grown man and i'm in tears (actually im only 19 but i like to think im a grown man :/    )

Here's why I'm soooo grateful for finding you people:

I've never actually been diagnosed with celiac,rye,barley allergies [(what?)](http://qkme.me/3s94no), but according to my mom, I have been throwing up shit since &lt;1 year old. Nobody I ever met in my childhood life ever heard of a gluten, and so for 14 unfortunate years **I never even knew what was wrong with me, all I knew is that I would VIOLENTLY VOMIT almost any food that I ate** And whats worse is that I had a crappy allergy test when I was 4

It wasn't until 14 that I finally made the connection between all these foods

Anyway, nobody formally taught me the culinary norms of this country, which allowed me to experiment. Example: peanut butter and rice? Normal americans would think that's disgusting (I assume) but its delicious! 

**if tl;dr :**
What I tried to make out of that last paragraph is that I would be honored to join this community

I say this because sometimes I'm scared that I'm just psychosomatizing. It's hard to think of never eating so many delicious foods ever again just because of my suspicion, but I feel like a ~HARD SCIENCE DIAGNOSIS~ would make it so much easier to put up with the minor disappointments.

I put my lunch in the work fridge when I got into the office this morning. It was only there for 1.5 hours before I went to grab a snack.

Someone had gone through my lunch and eaten about half my (gluten free) food that I had conscientiously prepared. I'm really unhappy right now. First off, so it's not like I can just run out to the sandwich shop around the corner and grab something there.

This really shows how much bad information gets out there.  

by The University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center on Monday

I was quite surprised to see that CBS news would provide unquestioned credibility to Dr. Davis, with no knowledgeable physician on the program to present a more accurate, balanced viewpoint on such an important issue as the role of wheat in nutrition and disease.
 
The assertions made by Dr. Davis (a cardiologist, but only for those with celiac disease. Gliadin an opioid that binds to the brain? Sure this is a stunning statement. What is the evidence? Aside from an obscure article that appeared almost 30 years ago reporting an opioid-like activity for some gliadin fractions, nothing else is available in the literature and certainly no data are there to show any binding to the brain.
 
There is enough confusion around celiac disease, I might add). Regrettably, CBS This Morning has added to the confusion and did a disservice to its viewership to allow such questionable information be portrayed as fact.
 
I have no ties at all to the wheat industry

**update!** Finished the pizza. Still feel fine (but very full).

**final update!** It is now the following morning, this doesn't necessarily mean that it was completely gluten-free or that my body didn't take any damage)! The pizza was really good and I will probably order it again.  
Some thoughts: I don't think I would order a pizza from a store that I knew was really busy - my local Domino's is usually pretty slow since most people prefer one of the 4-5 local pizza places in the area, because the crust was *really* good.  
The only thing I was not super excited about was the price - $20 ($17 plus $3 tip) for a small 10"" pizza. That is the same price I've paid for larger frozen/premade GF pizzas and for larger GF pizzas at nicer, because it seems very likely that those toppings would contain gluten.

I work at bar and just got off

Well

His name is 'R' and turns out he works at the bar across the street and we end up talking about alcohol as we both work at bars. We get to talking about local beers and he suggests one to me

 This is when he scoffs at me and tells me it's a fad

I told them both that I was genuinely sick my whole life, I feel much more awake, get sick less often, no stomach cramps, and rarely acid reflux. 
They continue to say it's a placebo. Seriously??!
How do you respond to people like this? I mean, almost every fried food known to man, label checking everything, and generally paying two times more for food?!

They pack a lot of fiber (and getting enough fiber is a challenge when you have Celiac and leaky gut and all that good stuff), it seems to come from bad experiences with Thanksgiving meals and those horrible Candied Yams all covered in Marshmallows. People either love or hate those!



What most people don't realize is that Sweet Potatoes work best in savory dishes. Their natural sweetness works best with savory foods, but they are designed to be naturally vegan, so they'll work either way. And, of course, they are totally Gluten Free! The hardest part of these recipes is peeling and dicing the sweet potatoes, but once you've done it one time, it gets easy and fast.



(Just a warning: I normally cook in a Cast Iron pan on a gas stove



-------



Recipe #1: Vegetable Curry


This can also be made with meat. If so, make sure it is diced in small chunks to add later.



1-2 medium-large sweet potatoes

1 each of your favorite vegetables. (You can use zucchini, cauliflower, carrots, even green beans! Whatever you like!)

3 tbsps olive oil 

1 1/2 tbsps curry powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder (I like to use the powders because I am lazy.)

1 can of unsweetened coconut milk (the kind with no sulfites)

1 can diced tomatoes

brown sugar

dried pepper flakes


----


Peel and dice sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch pieces.

Dice your vegetables into small pieces as well. 

Add olive oil to a large pan with lid and distribute the oil evenly on the bottom.

Add the sweet potatoes to the pan. Cover with the lid and turn the burner to medium-high.

Every 2 minutes, and stir the sweet potatoes so they don't burn to the bottom of the pan. Return the lid.

After a 5-minute head start

Continue stirring the veggies every 2 minutes to prevent burning

Once the sweet potatoes and other veggies are soft enough to cut through with your wooden spatula (but not mushy)

Sprinkle the veggies with curry powder and garlic powder. Mix to make sure they are completely coated.

Add coconut milk. Stir in well until the milk turns yellow.

Add brown sugar and dried pepper flakes until desired sweetness and spiciness is achieved. (I personally use a mango coconut pepper masala just to make it easier on myself!)

Once it just begins to come to a boil

Add diced tomatoes



You can also omit the tomatoes if you wish a spicier



--------------



Recipe #2: Sweet Potato Ragout


A Ragout is a French stew. It's typically made with beef or lamb, but is so hearty I typically eat it as a full dinner on its own. Although great for vegetarians and folks who do meatless nights, I tried this dish out on full-on carnivores (I took it to Thanksgiving this year with my friends) and they couldn't get enough of it! 



2-3 large sweet potatoes

1 each of your 3 favorite vegetables (I typically use  zucchini, but use whatever you prefer.)

3 tbsps olive oil

1 tbsp garlic powder

sea salt to taste

black pepper to taste

1-2 cups low sodium gluten-free vegetable broth


----

Peel and dice sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces.

Dice your vegetables into small pieces as well. 

Add olive oil to a large pan with lid and distribute the oil evenly on the bottom.

Add the sweet potatoes to the pan. Cover with the lid and turn the burner to medium-high.

Every 2 minutes, and stir the sweet potatoes so they don't burn to the bottom of the pan. Return the lid.

After a 5-minute head start

Continue stirring the veggies every 2 minutes to prevent burning

Once the sweet potatoes and other veggies are slightly mushy

Add the garlic powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix to make sure the veggies are completely coated. Taste the mix to ensure the appropriate amount of salt and pepper has been added.

Turn the heat to its lowest setting.

Pour the vegetable broth into the mix, do not add more broth. Taste the ragout, and add salt, pepper, or garlic powder to taste if necessary. Remove from heat.




This recipe is tricky and can take some experimentation to get the texture and consistency right. But

I didn't really have any problems with gluten in my teens, but in my 40s it started having bad effects on me. When I found out that I used to be allergic as a child I did some research and discovered that gluten can affect some people mentally, causing anger, forgetfulness, negative thoughts, brain fog, and dementia.

1372641400.0,1heboe,I would just really like to share my story with you guys,SnakeTongue7,41,4,12,"Alright

My freshman year of high school, Chrons, Celiac, any other allergies, I felt like my life was nothing but drinking disgusting things and getting pictures taken of my stomach. Nothing was coming up, nobody knew what to do with me. I lost about 20 pounds over the course of a few months; I was originally a healthy weight, so this was a bit scary. Well, it kind of just ""went away"". My symptoms became less severe and instead of having symptoms everyday

Fast forward to September 2011, and never stop. Every single day for 3 months I was vomiting at LEAST once a day - it was more like an average of 3 times a day. I couldn't keep food down and lost 40 pounds. No one knew what was wrong with me. My symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and extreme pain. A few months later in November I got a gastric empty study done and after 4 hours, my stomach had only emptied 70% of it's content. So, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis - my stomach was just simply not working. My doctor told me he didn't know why or how, it was idiopathic, and then I was at least vomiting less often - my average changed to about once or twice a week. However

In October of 2012, I found out that I had a B12 deficiency, I was faint all the time, I just didn't think I could get out of bed another day. One day I had extreme pain and I thought that maybe I had appendicitis. I went to the ER, they also thought I had appendicitis, but when they did the scan, I was fine. They discharged me with a UTI. A freaking UTI. I was out of my mind - I'm not crying in pain because of a UTI! I'm a tough girl, I'm not in this much pain because of a UTI.

This experience made me realize that my doctor was just not doing enough for me and went to go see another one (and this was the 8th doctor I've seen for my problems over the course of my journey.) Well, making it extremely difficult for food to pass through. Apparently, it is extremely rare, so I feel beyond grateful that I went to a doctor and saw a surgeon who were aware of this problem. This past March, I had surgery to bypass that part of my intestine. The moment I woke up, I felt SO MUCH better. I wasn't nauseous or in pain for the very first time in over a YEAR. I was absolutely ecstatic. My energy level was phenomenal, I was on cloud nine. 
Well, I felt faint and got brain fog (which is really hard to explain to other people!) and concluded that I probably had a gluten intolerance on top of everything else. Celiac runs in my family, so this wasn't really shocking. This was bittersweet to me - I just had surgery to relieve me of MOST of my symptoms that made me feel like I was going to go insane - if I didn't die first - and now I realize that I can't eat the food I love the most anymore. I was extremely grateful that my symptoms were mostly relieved, but at that point I just felt like I couldn't catch a break.

However, I thank all of you and everyone else outside of Reddit who has made what would have been an even more devastating realization, not so terrible. And every time I get frustrated with the GF diet, I just remember how miserable I used to be and am happy that this is now my only struggle. Again, I'm sorry for the block of text, but thank you for reading my story and being so awesome!

TL;DR - I was super sick, but you guys rock and make it okay.

**Price**: My pizza came to $11.66. This is not too terrible and I believe the convenience of having a gluten free pizza that can be delivered to you and tastes great largely makes it well worth the price.

Then, bread stuffing... and was horribly ill for more than a week after; maybe up to a month.  That's when I first discovered the brain fog.  Even after I physically felt better, it seemed like I had to churn taffy in my brain to have a thought   My eyes were heavy, and I slept a lot (now I recognize this lingers even after the intestinal signs of an accidental glutening have passed).  Okay, so even without an exact diagnosis (I wasn't about to go back on gluten after how sick I was then) I knew I had to get serious. 

I bought The Gluten Free Bible and lots of other GF books - I used those GF cookbooks a lot then, and began reading for non-obvious gluten ingredients (like modified food starch) and stopped drinking beer completely instead of ""one, once an a while"".

It sucked.  Oh

I was traveling this past weekend, I can eat something almost anywhere, don't worry"".  I never would have said that a year ago, or 6 months ago.  I would have been embarrassed about putting people out and struggled to over-explain what I could and couldn't eat.  Now, it's fine, I JUST NOW realized I don't even think about it too much anymore.

But now, but figured out I love greek salads and spinach salads.  I've found certain Chinese restaurants that use GF soy sauce - and they watch out for me, know I get sick, and tell me if something I order can't be made ""safely"".  When I eat out I know how to ask the waiter to *ask the chef* about ingredients or cross-contamination (the best piece of advice I've ever gotten; be clear that you are not asking them, you are asking them to ask the chef on your behalf).  If I feel a high degree of trust in a chef/waiter combination, I may go wild and ask if a particular dish can be modified for me.  So many people in the food service industry have a relative or close friend who is GF that it's getting easier and easier to do. 

I know how to avoid fries by ordering a fruit cup, rye, and most oats) to a food service person and usually notice whether or not they understand.

I don't carry gluten free crackers around with me anymore, om nom nom).  Now I have no shame in asking for apple slices from the kitchen/waiter/host - brie, spinach dip (as long as it's GF), and most of that stuff go great with apple slices and I don't have to stare at it longingly wishing I'd brought my own crackers.  

I also used to carry gluten-free oatmeal with me when I traveled (I travel a lot) so that I could always have something to eat if a given meal absolutely would not work for me.  It was good at the beginning, even if I need to get up earlier to find it.  I used to mourn at ""free continental breakfast"" hotels that I could no longer have a donut or a croissant or cereal, but now I feel a banana, apple, and hard boiled egg is a fine breakfast (and 7-11, White Hen, or gas stations/convenience stores usually have them).

I'm getting into a good stride and it's no longer a daily/weekly cycle of confusion

Here's the best advice I can give for those new to GF:

- Don't eat foods that are GF that you wouldn't have eaten before you went GF.  I didn't eat rice crispy treats regularly before I went GF, so why did I order a case of the ones I liked (Glutino are awesome) and eat them daily?  No more - if I didn't eat it daily before, why eat it now?

- GF products and recipes can be miserable.  If you try one that everyone else has rated as 5-star on your favorite GF site/forum and it's horrible, there are still things that the rest of the GF community says are ""fantastic"" but I think taste like cardboard).

- Experiment.  Find one brand of GF pasta, etc.  Then stop experimenting for a while.  Constantly trying to find yet another thing I could eat wore me out.  Now I have a pattern and it's much less a concern, much less exhausting.

- Make a rule: if you can't eat it, or your SO loves that homemade chicken noodle soup of yours.  It sounds selfish, but STOP MAKING THINGS YOU CAN'T EAT.  (this phenomenon may be mostly mommy bloggers who are entirely selfless, but they're torturing themselves and feeling angry, worthless, and frustrated all the time.  it sucks.  stop it.).

- Ask, but then I got ahold of the guy in charge of foodservice.  It turns out a lot of other people had been calling to find out if there would be GF stuff available so he made one bar/kiosk completely GF, with GF beer (Redbridge), GF hot dog buns, hot dogs cooked on a GF grill/roller, etc.  (San Francisco/AT&amp;T park, the bar behind home plate on the promenade!  Ask at guest relations and they'll point you there).  I do this for places I love and frequent whenever I'm in a good, frantic mood.  When that happens I just eat my apples and drink water instead of getting into frustrating situations where I end up tearing up hearing ""no

Anything else that I missed?  Any other veteran advice that makes things easier?  Any other newbie frustrations or confusions that some of us can help with?

1355700282.0,14yp3z,Top 10 Things To Know About Living Gluten-Free,camerondare,45,14,36,"My mom currently runs a blog called: http://wheatfreemom.com that shares delicious gluten-free recipes!

Recently she put out a free report of her ""Top 10 Things To Know About Living Gluten-Free""

1. Be Informed
Be your own advocate for living a great gluten-free lifestyle. Read the latest information so you have a better understanding of which foods and ingredients contain gluten. Talk to friends and family members who are already gluten-free. Follow gluten-free blogs so that you have access to great recipes as well as information on living gluten-free.

2. Know Your Ingredients
Read all your labels. Do NOT assume that any foods are gluten-free. Watch for words like: modified dairy, stabilizer, malted and hydrolyzed protein.

Go to www.celiac.ca (Canada) or www.celiac.com (US) for more detailed information.

3. Keep A Well-Stocked Pantry
Fill it with gluten-free options so that you always have food on hand. Examples: Cereal (e.g. Corn Chex or Rice Chex), Flour blends for baking, gluten-free baking power, xanthan gum, pancake mix, corn or rice pasta, gluten-free soy sauce as well as other sauces and marinades. Snacks (e.g. granola bars, cookies, and rice. Also stock your fridge with fresh vegetables

4. Embrace Change
While initially the though of living gluten-free can be overwhelming, better! Cooking gluten-free means using quality, unprocessed ingredients - whole foods, fresh vegetables and fruits, meats and fish. Take this time to (re)-learn how to cook. Try a cooking class or ask a friend or family member to help you. Get excited! What an opportunity to discover wonderful spices, herbs and flavors.

5. Explore Your Options
Get to know your local grocery and health food stores. I was surprised to find out London Drugs here in Calgary, sausages, soups, etc.

Living gluten-free means shopping in a variety of places to get great food.

6. Ask Questions
More and more restaurants offer gluten-free dishes but if in doubt, however, when you've nixed the bread basket offer and the water will instead bring you crackers. Not everyone is aware of what contains gluten or wheat, so you might have to explain it more than once. Be leery of any establishment that downplays your Celiac disease or gluten-intolerance. Remarks like ""Are you actually allergic?"" or ""Isn't gluten-free just a weight loss fad?"" may indicate a lack of sensitivity to your special dietary restrictions.

7. Always Be Prepared
More often than not, a piece of fruit or even a small sandwich. Fast food chains are generally not gluten-free friendly. It only takes a few minutes before you leave the house to get prepared.

8. Beware of Cross-Contamination
Most of us don't live alone, cross-contamination happens. Things like a shared butter dish, toaster, cutting board or food preparation areas and communal condiments like mayonnaise, peanut butter and jam can all collect unseen crumbs that can make you sick. Have your own jars and label them as gluten-free so that no one but you uses them. Make sure cutlery, dishes and counters are kept really clean because even a few crumbs or flour dust can bother a gluten-free stomach.

9. Know Your Physicians
Forge a good relationship with your health professional(s): your gastrointestinal surgeon, so if you encounter one who is being a pain, seek others.)

10. Be Empowered!
You have the right not to be sick. Fight for your health and clean, is it really a big deal to eat a little bit of wheat?"" At first I felt guilty not eating what others were eating or inconveniencing others to accomodate my dietary needs... until my friend and acupuncturist explained to me that what I had was an allergy to gluten, an allergy that was just as valid as an allergy to dairy or cats or pollen. She asked if I would give just a little bit of peanut butter to someone with a peanut allergy. I, of course, said absolutely not. Gluten should be dealt with in the same way.

Last week I underwent an upper endoscopy recommended by my GI Doctor. She's fantastic.

I went fully gluten free two years ago after realizing that ingesting wheat immediately makes me feel inebriated; my attention span is quite minimal for the weeks to follow. I will have bruises all over my body following a gluten attack from accidentally bumping into... everything.

I also have a plethora of indicators pointing to celiacs (Though I am self-diagnosed as having gluten ataxia) including poor liver function

My doc said ""endoscopy"" and I said ""awesome."" In the days leading up to the procedure three separate people encouraged me to cancel. One of which was my dermatologist (who is self diagnosed gluten-sensitive)

Why did they want me to cancel? Simple. I haven't purposefully ingested gluten in two years. The tests will probably came back negative.

Something told me to persist and go anyway.

To all you well drinkers - I found out about 7 years ago I had celiac disease. I don't know how much this will effect you if you are simply gluten intolerant but well liquor is usually *not* gluten free. 

Let me explain - my brother and I are big drinkers. Er
 Get this - if the liquor uses wheat during the process that wheat will come out but if and only IF there is a high number of distillations. A cheap ass well liquor will most likely not have been distilled more than once. Which risks there still being enough gluten inside to make us sick.

this morning I got glutened on the last day of a cruise, but I felt like I was being yelled at for trying to be extra careful. 

it ended with my mom telling me I need to see a therapist because she's worried about my mental status because of having celiac and that truly sent me over the edge. she says I'm being obsessive and that it's turning into a phobia because its all I think about. but I kind of HAVE to be thinking about it all the time

am I being too obsessive or not obsessive enough because I'm still getting glutened. she says she understands but I don't think that she does because she doesn't have celiac. 

there is always going to be a psychological component of celiac. a constant fear and worry that anything around me could be harmful

I hate being celiac sometimes and yeah sometimes it's a huge bummer in my life but I also know that this diagnoses also saved my life so I'm incredibly thankful. I just wish that sometimes people would realize if they feel this stressed about my eating habits

I was only 21 and in the middle of trying to figure out EVERYTHING else in my life (college graduation, how I was going to pay to feed myself and two dogs) I get hit in the face with this diagnoses that changed everything. (I was about to go to culinary school to be a baker in Chicago and then I find out my very passion is what is slowly killing me. so yeah I easily changed my focus towards gluten free baking in hopes of opening an entirely gluten free cafe so that maybe the future celiacs of my town don't have to feel like such food outcasts) after the diagnoses I've had to change EVERYTHING. everything I studied and learned about baking was mostly useless. I had to change the only thing I've ever known was solid, my eating habits. it's been really hard, amazing, but hard. I don't know where I'm going with this, I just needed to vent to a group of people who get all these things I'm feeling. I'm just a kid and this is hard. for my mom to tell me I need a psychiatrist because I'm thinking about gluten obsessively was too much for me. it just sent me over the edge and I copped an attitude. that was wrong I know and I feel bad but this is my life. reading labels and googling frantically before I put everything in my mouth, otherwise I may as well eat poison. while all my friends are at beer factory, I'm stuck with liver damage and a fucked up stomach. While my family enjoys our traditional stuffing on thanksgiving I'm googling to make sure the lotion and shampoo I use to avoid gluten through the skin. I miss my carefree life way more than a non-gluten free person will ever understand.

Makes 2 cookie-sheets

In a mixer

	2 Tble. softened butter
	1 Egg
	1/2 tsp. salt
	1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
	2 C. shredded sharp cheddar  (8 oz.)
	
In a separate bowl

	3/4 C. brown rice flour
	1/4 C. potato starch (not potato flour)
	1 tsp. xanthan gum

Set aside for later use:
	
	Kosher salt for sprinkling on top of crackers

Gradually add dry mixture to mixing bowl of cheese mixture.  If crumbly, until the dough sticks together.  

Divide the dough into two equal balls.  Wrap each in plastic wrap and allow to rest for about 1/2 an hour.  This allows the xanthan gum to absorb the moisture.  (If pressed for time

Unwrap and place one of the balls of dough on a 14.5""x19""(-ish) Silpat cooking mat.  (If you don't have one of these Silicone cooking mats, it is essential that you get the dough even.  Roll dough out to within about an inch of the edge of the Silpat or paper.  It may not seem like you have enough dough, but if you're rolling it thin and even you will.  Try to square your edges as much as possible.  

Once dough is rolled out

Slide the Silpat onto a perforated support tray or parchment paper onto an un-insulated cookie sheet.

Repeat this process with the second pan while you cook the first pan.

Bake for 8 minutes.  But keep an eye on them.  You want the tops of the air bubbles on the crackers to be just brown, pick off the crisp crackers, and pop the rest of the pan back into the oven.  Repeat the process as much as you need.  If you have some really thick crackers, you can flip them over before you put them back in the oven.  This will help them crisp up evenly.

I have been diagnosed with Celiac for over a year and haven't seen much improvement on the gluten-free diet. 

So I tried out a Whole30 for the month of June, corn, rice and sugar, and then I went right back on it! I felt uncomfortably full from those foods, and even got a headache and had trouble sleeping.

I went from 135 to 130 lbs, among other things. I had mostly subsisted on rice and corn-based products, with a fair amount of legumes, some dairy, and moderate amounts of veggies and fruit. I pretty much used to eat a lot of eggs, bananas, Udi's bread, and processed foods.

I sleep better and feel stronger and less fatigued already. My only exercise has been walking a mile or two a day most days

As a former vegetarian, and the rest from beef, turkey, or fish (for some reason, chicken and pork haven't been appealing).

Aside from some stomach trouble at first, and had every carb craving imaginable. It was almost as bad as quitting smoking at times. Even seeing people eat certain foods on tv was difficult. And I won't get into the stomach troubles, but my digestion is a work in progress. There was a week where I didn't have the energy to exercise, but that's ok. Sweet potatoes/yams were pretty necessary for my proper functioning.

Celiac left me with a lot of nutritional deficiencies, but every vegetable and fruit tastes way better than before too. 

I get most of my calories from fats, some coconut oil, and olive oil. There is definitely a lot more cooking involved, but it has been worth it. We'll see what I choose to add back in, but so far I am happy with it!

I highly recommend giving the Whole30 a try

First came the gas: I was REALLY flatulent, it's just me…*)

Slowly the problem got worse. Sometimes my belly would become so distended I could barely function or wear clothing. Heating pads didn't help

Soon enough, every day*- my midsection felt planetary. I thought everyone experienced this, that it was completely normal, and it was just that no one was talking about it. It would have been, after all, embarrassing to openly address my similarities to Walter the Farting Dog. My doctor finally prescribed me a daily Prilosec pill in an attempt to get a hold on my gastrointestinal confusion.

The worst part was when true pain reared its ugly head. Sometimes I would have this feeling like my intestines were repeatedly being punched, heartburn relief, and gas eliminating pills.

Most disturbingly of all, it was having all the wrong ones. One result of the aforementioned eating disorders was a great sensitivity to the feelings in my digestive system. But I stopped feeling hunger. There was no fullness. There was no satisfaction, only bloating and burning and pain. This freaked me out more than anything.

One day, ""stop eating gluten,"" like it was NBD (and possibly also like I was crazy).

... fuck, my relationships with both food and my belly are 1000% better. 

I'm at a place I didn't think I could ever reach; three years of being a human balloon was a much longer time than I thought. And when I consider the time I spent hating food and my body and my self before then… it makes me cry. But now I have had a year of goodness and I feel healthy and in tune and I am learning to like and appreciate my body. I feel like me. I feel like a human.

I won't say that cutting gluten from my diet solved all my problems (I'm an underpaid fine arts graduate…). It's just a grain protein. But still

I am 6 weeks into a GF diet. I started it on a recommendation from my chiropractor, I might lose a few kilos, because I never planned on buying GF substitutes, just removing them. I didn't think it would have any effect. I cut out both gluten and dairy.

And then... I suddenly was feeling full after I ate. This is coming from the girl who, I never understood proper portions because I just had insatiable hunger. 

I was sleeping better

I lost 3kg in a week from bloating. My stomach shrank, jibbly bit of fat (I'm fat, I used to eat a lot of pasta, uncontrollably).

The one that makes me cry, blocking my view, sometimes making things jerky, like life is a quick succession of pictures rather than a flowing video. It was just gone one day. I felt GOOD.  

Then I got glutened. The first time, cranky, felt like I'd had two bottles of wine. It took me a day to figure it out, and I felt like a fool. I always thought it would just be the runs, or vomiting. I'd always attributed the fog to spinal issues in my neck and lower back. 

Then it happened again, and happens within an hour of eating. I don't have gas anymore, but I get it, and it's painful. Then, the next night (slow metabolism), cramping. Sweet Jesus, the pain. It gets intense for about half an hour and then I get white cold, and I want to vomit. Then I need the toilet. I haven't vomited so far

It's not just one symptom, I get bloated. 

My chiro is also on a GF diet. I asked him what happens if he eats

I've done a bit of reading, I won't do it. So I have no test, no conclusive evidence. People ask if I've been tested, and I say no, and they automatically assume I'm on a fad diet. I've had that said to my face. It hurts, they don't get the pain, the fog, the cramping.

I don't feel like I belong here

Yesterday, I'm sitting here reflecting on how I got here. I would love to hear your story. Maybe, just maybe, yours is similar to mine, your symptoms are the same, something, to make me feel like I really do belong on this path

When I was just a little boy

Doctor: ""Coeliac

I have bad music taste and worse poetry skills.

I also had the privilege of not having to eat gluten from age 3 to age 11 , or a miracle had occured, because after a gastroscopy and related pleasant -scopies, in 1990 specialists concluded that, hey, it should be fine now. And then I stepped into the vast world of gluten-containing food.

Fast forward through gluteneous puberty, and I find myself with vague symptons of tiredness, light dermatitis, weight gain, some migraines etc. All attributable to lifestyle, stress, mundane external factors

Enter my skin-specialist sister. 

S: That dermatitis? Food related. You should retry gluten free.

Z: Are you absolutely kidding me?

S: Nope. Do it.

Z: Hell no.

S: Seriously.

Z: NO! I AM FREEEE. I NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

S: Maybe you should try it anyway.

Z: NEVER


So another month later

I went to a bio-supermarket to stack up and did not really know what to expect. 

My childhood memories mostly contain the well known untasty bread, just the bread. With that taste. 

The supermarket I went to last week had gluten free food. 32 shelves of it; I counted them. There was regular fresh bread, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, granola, flour, rice puffs, cereal-stuff, cakes, sandwiches... I felt like someone in the Klondike Gold Rush who discovered A Big One.  

I got a cart full of goods and went home to rearrange my pantry. And restarted my diet. It's going much better than expected. 

When I was a child I couldn't go to a party, making me stand out. No cake for me. No biscuits. No treats. Evil gluten inthere.  I'll just sit here with my foul defrosted dry bread and crisp breads, looking at you munching pie and cake, thank you very much. No problem at all.

Today, granola and other treats for the occasion and even share that with others as well! My cinnamon cookies are a favourite by all.  Some hamburger buns for a bbq, some ciabatta for a brunch. A huge difference comppared to 25 years ago. I'm very happy the choice is so elaborate nowadays, making it so much easier to avoid gluten. I even had gluten free pancakes on sunday. 

I do have to adapt to the lack of fiber; but that's a small price. Already my skin is getting better (that, so good, and less adaptation needed than expected. 

This little story just to say that from my time-warped perspective, because I see I haven't found all the new stuff and possibilities by far.

My mom just made chicken alfredo and it smells so good. I want it and I made GF noodles for myself but I can't bring myself to eat them. I made them right and as soon as they were done they looked like regular noodles but 10 minutes later as I'm about to eat

It's not fair. I didn't ask for this stupid disease. I'd rather be fat and eat the foods I want than to be skinny and suffer watching everyone eat what I wish I could. I hate celiac. I hate it so much. I hate it when I tell people I can't eat wheat and they straight up ask me if I can eat WHEAT bread. No you stupid fuckers. 
I hate it when people come to school with baked goods and I have to say no and watch everyone sit and chow down. I hate cullinary class where all we make is quickbreads and while everyone else is sitting there eating I have to sit and watch them, but its still frustrating as all hell. 
I play it off like its no big deal most of the time but it really gets to me. Like right now. I'm so sick and tired of it. I wish they would develope a pill we could take.

Edit: thank you, one of my brothers, and my sister all have celiac as well and react to it a lot worse than I do.

As for my culinary teacher, I'll talk to her about it and see if I can arrange something. After I told my mom how upset I was she made me more GF noodles. Her trick is pouring some olive oil on them right after draining them out, it keeps them from sticking. Celiac really gets to me sometimes, but I'm feeling a lot better now.

Starbucks is unable to guarantee a ""gluten-free"" environment in our retail locations due to the potential for cross contamination with gluten-containing products. The open environment and operating procedures of our store locations may present additional risk for gluten-sensitive customers aside from the gluten-containing ingredients themselves.

Tuna

My normal lunch is a cup of rice, but taste pleasantly of a deli-style pickle. Rye bread is my all-time favorite, but much too fibrous to digest easily. So, to simulate the rye, I add a sprinkle of caraway and a little fennel to the rice before starting the cooker. For the tomato, a couple fresh slices alongside the finished product, along with a little canned diced tomato (with a little of the juice) transmits tomato-ness to every grain of the rice

Top with a can of tuna and mustard to taste, without upsetting my digestion. If anything, I'd say that rice is even more effective than bread in transmitting the wanted flavors.

I'm still learning about how to go about this the right way, they don't. And I got excited, so I posted that on my FB: ""PINKBERRY IS GLUTEN FREE!? That should not have been brought to my attention.""

When I woke up the next morning I was met with this comment from a college acquaintance: ""Yogurt never had any gluten to begin with. This is about as dumb as gluten free hotdogs or gluten free dried fruit. **Seriously

Are you serious? I know this girl well enough; she was serious.

What followed was myself and a few GF friends commenting on the fact that we know it isn't the healthiest. And I insisted that this wasn't for weight loss. 

She responded: ""Ok, fruits, beans, herbs, spices, and vegetables don't have gluten. It's a wheat product. It's only when you add something to them like cookie dough ice cream that you would have to look for gluten because that's in the dough. But **lauding something for being gluten free when it never had gluten is retarded**, but I get that they do that b/c people don't understand what the hell is in their food.
I honestly believe if people in this country would make their own food rather than eat prepared meals

She then described her dietary habits to prove why she was healthier than all of us. A friend then told her that when she makes ice cream, and followed with: 

""And most people don't think about their food choices
Personally I think the gluten free diet fad is overwrought. Humans have bred (pun!) wheat for millenia and our bodies have adapted for wheat digestion. I think its more likely that the chemicals we spray on these crops are causing these problems not the crop itself.""

I then told her that I hope she phrases her arguments better if she ever meets someone with Celiac's Disease

I would post the whole conversation

I love this subreddit. It has made my gluten free journey easier and I feel that I'm not alone. I know I'm an idiot for slipping

He refuses to believe that all the issues are related to diet.  We've been multiple doctors and all have dismissed my concerns saying he may have food triggers but its likely just a migraine disorder(his migraines are very severe).     His MRI results were normal.

I am gluten free due to an intolerance to gluten but not full blown celiac.  I have stressed that it would be worth attempting an elimination diet cutting out gluten but he is pretty unwilling to do so.   He eats a lot of wheat, and snacks.  He cut dairy for a week before giving up on that. He hardly ever eats what I make because he is pretty picky. 

Does anyone have any experience with this problem?  How do I persuade him to even consider cutting gluten?

I noticed last year that Marks and Spencer (UK and Ireland) had a very small gluten free section of breads and cakes and most of these contained glucose-fructose syrup (high fructose cornstarch) which I don't eat as I gained a huge amount of weight when I was eating it.

Recently I noticed that they had chicken nuggets and breaded chicken breasts with the gluten-free symbol on them. They are delicious! Then I bought their Angus burgers and again, the sausages are the same and more and more 'regular' items have been subtly made gluten free. People still buy them, they still taste the same as they always did but now I can eat them again!

I found a list on the website of all the foods NOT containing gluten. This is a huge step for Ireland as most of the gluten-free products here are disgusting or just loaded with sugar. It's so nice to just have some real chicken nuggets for a change!

1315499089.0,k8yc5,How do I make sure I'm not glutened when being treated at a hospital? ,SinfullySweet420,22,1,29,"Hello all

I informed every nurse and doctor I saw in the ER that night that I was in fact Celiac and unable to ingest gluten of any kind. I was given several different drugs and with each one I asked if it was gluten free. The responses from the medical staff for bewildering. One nurse just flat out said she had no idea. When I asked her to check to see if it was she basically said she didn't know how and asked if I wanted to feel better or continue arguing. I was in immense pain so I took the medicine. 

Later I expressed my concerns to the doctor and her idea of making sure I didn't get sick was to give me an arsenal of anti-nausea medicine including a suppository. By the time we got me home I had a 1000 mg anti biotic a prescription for the suppositories and another for percoset and another for vicodin. I woke yesterday with a screaming head ache and sever abdominal pain but had to get myself to my pre op appointment (I'm having surgery on the 12 of Sept. for a hysterectomy to treat severe endometriosis.) At the doctor's office I got sick twice and the doctor asked me what was wrong I informed her that I suspected being glutened at the ER last night. I asked her if she could check on my medicines because I think they were the cause. She responded by telling me to eat a piece of bread or some saltine crackers to help me keep the medicine down and tried to prescribe me more medicine for the migraine. I was just blown away. 

How on Earth do you get through a situation like this without being poisoned when it is quite obvious that not even the medical field is fully educated on Celiac disease. Any suggestions? Similar stories? Lists of drug alternatives for medicines such as antibiotics and pain medications? Thanks in advance for any and all feedback.

I got a call from my doctor Tuesday afternoon telling me I'd tested positive for Celiac's.  The news was a total shock.  My mom had been diagnosed a few months back, but I had it done so my mom could stop worrying.  Against everyone's expectations, the test came back solidly positive for Celiac's.  An hour earlier I'd been eating some leftover Papa John's for lunch, and now I was staring down a lifetime on a GF diet.  

After a couple days of processing, since my symptoms have been so mild compared to what so many people go through.  I realize now I've been having digestive irritation for a few months, but it had never been serious enough for me to even realize anything was out of the ordinary.  I'd never have even been tested if my mom hadn't been on my case to do so.  That makes the /r/skeptic subscriber in me feel like I'm one of the ""fashionably"" GF people who does it for BS pseudo-scientific health reasons without really needing it, even though I've been handed a clinical diagnosis.  Add to that I'm worried about being a burden on the people in my life, forcing them to adjust their lives to accommodate me.  

I know this is far from the end of the world, and just felt completely lost.

I figure this will all even out after a while, and I'm looking forward to becoming part of the community.  I could just really use some guidance on what the next couple days or weeks will hold, or better yet some definitive action items I could work on to help me feel a bit more in control.

After some research I decided to try to cut out wheat for a while and see if if helped my energy - after about 2.5 weeks I've noticed a massive improvement in my sleeping patterns

I don't have any intestinal issues however - never had any stomach problems

Sorry if that's a foolish sounding question.

Has anyone else had any success with cutting out wheat for health or fatigue reasons as opposed to an intolerance?

**Caprese Pizza with Cauliflower Crust**

Ingredients:

*Cauliflower crust:*

1/2 head cauliflower (or 2 1/2 cups coarsely grated cauliflower)

1 garlic clove

Pinch of salt and pepper

1 cup part skim mozzarella

1 large egg

1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano


*Caprese topping:*

2 tablespoon basil pesto

1 cup fresh mozzarella
2 roma tomates

1-2 tablespoon fresh basil

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray cooking spray on a large baking sheet or pizza pan and set aside.

2. Remove stems and leaves from cauliflower and coarsely grate cauliflower florets to resemble rice to make 2 1/2 cups.

3. Place grated cauliflower, about 7-8 minutes.

4. Place cauliflower in a medium bowl and cool slightly. Add in mozzarella

5. Spread on baking sheet and press down forming crust about 8-9 inches.

6. Bake in preheated oven for 12-14 minutes until brown.

7. Spread pesto on top of cooked crust. Top with mozzarella

8. Cool slightly

I used the crust recipe and topped mine with pesto, and the flavors were very fresh. My only gripe was that the crust was a little soggy in the center after I baked it with the toppings on -- but, I think that maybe I didn't cook it long enough during the first bake. Next time I'm going to cook the crust itself a bit longer before I add toppings.

I stopped at 3 tablespoons, when it was a nice latte shade. Then plop dollops of this nutella mixture onto your cake. With a butter knife, run circles, squares, stars, curves, whatevs, and let it set in the oven undisturbed for an hour. Chill completely before serving.

1375255828.0,1jeplb,I have officially resorted to punishing my body for being so ridiculous! [RANT/QUESTIONS],Jazzerciser24,18,2,30,"Let me preface this by saying I'm extremely frustrated

Mid-May, it was in spurts.

I talked to my primary care doctor about my symptoms and asked if she thought it might be due to gluten. She said it was most likely dairy so to give that up first. I cut all dairy out of my diet for two weeks but didn't feel better. I still needed to take laxatives to go even a little, and I was just all-around miserable. So, next I cut out gluten.

Within a day, I could only ever go a little at a time, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. However, the feeling of extreme fullness went away--for about two weeks. I started to get sick every few days at that point, and then almost every day. I wasn't constipated anymore, but the constant fullness was intense. I also always felt gassy without ever actually being able to pass gas. I could hardly even let my SO touch me because I felt too bloated. The few times I attempted sex I had severe pain.

Finally, because I had lost 15-20 pounds within the first three weeks of going gluten-free. So, I called my PC doctor to get her opinion about whether or not soy could be causing my discomfort. That was the only thing I had really changed in my diet; I started putting soy milk in my coffee as a substitute for half and half. However, my PC doctor said no one is allergic to soy. She prescribed me an antacid and told me to take it for a month before making another appointment to see her. I thought that was ridiculous, though. First of all, who is to say I have a stomach acid issue? And even if I do, isn't an antacid a temporary fix? I decided to ditch my doctor at that point and see a naturopath.

My naturopath agreed it could be the soy, but the good days would only last for two to three at a time before I got sick again. At this point I was only eating at home and keeping a food journal. I also started having my SO brush his teeth before kissing me and cleaning his crumbs off the counter. But still I got sick. It got to the point where I'd react to the most random things, like vegan pesto, steak, or guacamole, so I decided to do a full elimination diet to finally identify the little bastard that was ruining my life.

For an entire week, and fruit. I also cut out alcohol. And for the first time in a long time, I felt great for more than a couple days at a time! However, I also felt myself missing my favorite foods, particularly nightshades. (I love tomatoes and jalapenos so much that they are literally the only plants I grow in my garden.) So, a week into the new diet, I talked to my naturopath about how miserable I was. The next day was the 4th of July, dairy

That night, even though the acne that had plagued me for the past year was starting to improve. Still, I stupidly decided to drink cider and make spicy quinoa patties on the 4th. I was in and out of the bathroom all day, and then I got constipated again.

Ever since, corn, or dairy since eliminating them. I started getting sick less frequently, but still I would get that full feeling sometimes and have no idea what it was from. Recently, I felt great for like 7-8 days in a row. But then exactly one week ago today, I saw my very first ripe cherry tomato of the season. I ate it, without having any other breakfast

On Sunday morning, the only thing that seemed safe to eat was a side salad and fried eggs. And to my utter frustration, something made me sick! I also broke out with five deep red pimples on my chest later that night/the next morning. (I usually only break out during my period or ovulation, but this was smack dab in the middle of both.) I spent all afternoon in bed feeling at the end of my rope. I mean, there's no point whatsoever attempting to be social if I'm going to get sick off a side salad (maybe with white vinegar?). Or, maybe I should just eat my favorite foods if I'm going to be sick regardless!

So, and hot peppers. And? I don't feel any worse than I did. I'm still hovering around 70% like myself. I thought for sure I'd have to be hospitalized, but I hardly even got cramps. The only extra symptoms I even notice (and these may be in my head) are itchy skin (I was so itchy I thought I had a rash when I woke up), an itchy bottom, and an itchy vagina. I also can't really go to the bathroom. Constipation has been the norm, though, lately

Now I'm just really confused. Is this even a gluten intolerance like I had originally thought? Or is this more likely a parasite, I should probably see someone other than a naturopath, right?

And, we should remove all gluten from the kitchen. Is this something I should consider? My insurance sucks, so I'd rather not take this test if it's not necessary.

Sorry for the long post. But can anyone help me? I know many of you have been battling issues like these for years,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,t3_1jeplb

I was wondering if I could get some help with an interpretation of my Celiacs diagnosis journey.

In 2009

At the same time they performed a blood allergy test

Because the doctor advised me that a wheat allergy and a gluten reaction are two entirely different things

Well....the allergy scratch test came back NEGATIVE for wheat and from what I've read on Dr. Google

And then of course... the biopsy came back negative as well (just stomach inflammation but no damaged villi) so the end result of that was the blood test was a false positive for gluten intolerance as well. 

All of this is SO BIZAREE to me! How can both of these come back positive at the same time and be so related but so different at the same time

I know this is a lot of medical rambling but I am feeling confused. I did do a GF diet for about a year. I didn't notice too much difference in how I felt

Not only does gluten cause bowel and stomach pain and problems. It also causes skin problems

Going gluten free has changed my life in a positive way i never even dared to dream off. I have made mistakes a few times and got poisoned. Those few times were horrible and a real nightmare to get trough. 

I find myself increasingly obsessive about the food I eat. I don't trust anyone or anything. 
Both my boyfriend and mother love to take me out to lunch and I love going but it really scares me to death every time. My boyfriend wants to take me out for dinner this week and I have bin looking up restaurants but I simply don't trust them! even when they say they can do gluten free if you say so in advanced. 

I just spend 2 days in a row eating at my parents for Christmas dinner. Both nights I got gluten poisoned. I did not tell my mum cause I know she really put a lot of effort into making sure that everything I ate was gluten free and it will break her heart if she knew I got ill. 

It just seems so much simpler and peaceful for me If I make my own meals at home so I can control everything. But I am disappointing so many people with doing that.
 
I am going a little to far with my obsession I think. At the dinner table at my parents house I had a small panic moment as I saw People touching stuff with their gluten filled hands and I was afraid I would then touch it as well and get sick. How realistic is this anyway? How easy is it for gluten to transfer?

I thought it was because I had made my roommate a sandwich (Bread) before I ate my food, and we used the same bag of deli meat.

Now, hot skin, cold fingers... the whole shebang.

My issue with the peanut butter is... I can eat peanuts just fine. I have a jar of 'party peanuts' (No 'made in a factory...' crap) that I snack on from time to time at school, but I've never gotten pain from such a low amount of cross contamination.

One of the things that I always miss about Ireland is the brown bread. Irish brown bread is unsurpassed. In America we don't have anything that's even a rough equivalent. This bread recipe is as close as anything I've had outside of Ireland to the classical brown bread. It just so happens to also be gluten free.

Ingredients:

* active dry yeast - 1 Tbsp (7 grams)

* sugar                 - 3 Tbsp (40 grams)

* warm water        - 1+1/2 cups (not so boiling. just warm. like 110 deg)

* buckwheat flour - 1+1/4 cups (150 grams) 

* sorghum flour    - 3/4 cups (97 grams)

* potato starch      - 1 cup (130 grams) (I substitue arrowroot starch)

* tapioca starch    - 1/2 cups (60 grams)

* xanthan gum     - 2 tsp (4 grams)

* sea salt              - 1 tsp

* olive oil             - 3 Tbsp (45 ml)

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, and warm water. let proof until foamy (like 10 min).

2. lightly grease an 8x4 inch metal loaf pan

3. In a separate bowl, potato starch (or in my case, arrowroot starch - for some reason the country I live in has all these ingredients except for potato starch), tapioca starch, xanthan gum, and sea salt

4. add olive oil to the foamy yeasty sugar water. stir so the olive oil is roughly evenly distributed as you slowly add the dry ingredients. mix until smooth (it never gets particularly doughy - it's really more sticky than doughy) 

5. spread the dough in the loaf pan. (this is way easier if your hands are soaking wet. when your hands are coated in water the dough doesn't stick to them and is easy to manipulate)

6. preheat oven to 450 degrees. leave the dough in the pan on top of the stove to rise. let rise for 40 minutes

7. place the pan on the center rack. bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees

8. reduce oven temperature to 385 degrees and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top and hollow sounding when tapped.

9. give it ten minutes to cool in the pan before transferring it to a cooling rack.

For my whole life doctors can not give me a definitive answer or diagnosis. I settled with a diagnosis of ""depression and anxiety"" and have been on Celexa daily. In 2010 I had a huge bout of digestive problems and finally caved and got a colonoscopy. They tested for Celiac and it came back normal. I was then given the diagnosis of IBS. I didn't do anything with this diagnosis because I didn't know what to do.

Fast forward to this month. I am sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I researched online and convinced myself I was hypothyroid. Got tested and it came back normal. Mono

1323886611.0,ncmud,I think you guys saved my life.  Trying cutting gluten and processed sugars.  One week in and I'm feeling so much better.,Delirious5,16,1,9,"For some context

I had a conversation with one of my body workers last week about the frequency that my back has fallen to pieces this year. Usually I have a blowout once every year or two. This year, and it all clicked into place. Over the last year, I was working retail at a fun and fair food store (junkfood, candy, popcorn and fair food). Six months ago, I lost that job and moved in with my mom, where I've been on a steady diet of macaroni

So that week , baked chicken, eggs and yogurt with bananas for breakfast. I got a lot less stiff, and my joints were moving better. 

And my mood improved. I've been under a particularly dark stormcloud this year. But the last few days had been great

Last Thursday, I grabbed a couple poptarts and ran. By the end of the night, I was in one of the blackest moods I've been in for a while. And that says something.  It was bad. It was bad enough that I spent two hours researching mental health clinics that work on a sliding scale, with the intention of calling in the morning and asking to try SSRI's. I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but I've chalked a lot of it up to the grief I've had to deal with in the last six years: hurricane Katrina, bad jobs, bad relationships and deaths of close loved ones. But looking at it that night, back through college

After that, stuttered and used the wrong words this year, and I haven't had insurance so I couldn't consult a doctor about it. But it's noticeable.

After more research, and started to cry in relief.  I don't think I'm crazy anymore!  I may just have been poisoning myself my entire life!

So I cut gluten.  And for good measure, to let my body rest and reset.  I'm obviously engaging on a level of self-diagnosis, so I'm taking my own self with a grain of salt and treating it as an experiment. I'll give this some time, and if this doesn't work, I'll try the meds.

After a week, and I can feel muscles that have been seized for years starting to let up a little bit.  I think I may still have sugars and gluten sneaking in.  I'm not sure how much cross-contamination is a problem for me.  But I feel positive, and I'm looking forward to feeling strong again, being able to put on muscle, and training in aerial arts.

Thank you all.",,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/ncmud/i_think_you_guys_saved_my_life_trying_cutting/

1370507492.0,1fs2xy,"Here are my ideas for cheap, quick, easy, GF food.",dagor_annon,3, or about not having time

Here's what I (a college student) recommend: (It helps that I have a kitchen now)

Start your meals with a cheap starch - Potato or Rice. Use cheap veggies (I like carrots and zucchini for decent price/filling) instead of using lots of meat.

Build up your kitchen. I bought one new seasoning each week - I worked my way through italian to mexican to asian seasonings - there's a lot of overlap (garlic, oregano,) and there are myriad flavor combinations to be enjoyed.
This list http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blherb2.htm is decent for what seasonings to get.

Use Mark Bittman's suggestions for kitchen equipment: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/09mini.html?pagewanted=all - although a rice cooker can be your best friend every (google 'rice cooker recipes' - most are gluten free


This recipe is my 'go to' - It's cheap

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••Super Easy Ten Minute Meals•••••••••••••••••••••••••••

•••••••••••••••••••Prep rice first to allow lots of easy quick meals•••••••••••••••••••

Cook up a large pot of rice (just water and rice


•••••••••••••••••••Ten minute meal (base)•••••••••••••••••••

Throw a bag of rice in the microwave (or put it in a pot if you don't have a microwave (been there!))

Take a boneless chicken thigh (available bulk

Chop the chicken (½ inch cubes

Take a zucchini (½ pound for $1.25) and chop up. Add to the pot.

Cook until the chicken looks 'done'

By now the rice should be warm - add it to the mixture

Delicious!



•••••••••••••flavor ingredients options for the ten minute meal•••••••••••••

••Tex-Mex - add a half cup of salsa and a teaspoon of cumin (it's the 'taco' flavor I can't resist!)

•• Italian - add a can of diced tomato ($1.08 at Wally-world

•• Asian - Tamari Soy Sauce (no wheat!) and a bit of cilantro

•• OTHER - look up recipes online

So - lots of different meals, and can be made in a single pan.

If I'm a bit poorer in a month


••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••



•••••••••••••••••••Simple Substitutions•••••••••••••••••••

I use my pre-cooked rice in place of noodles for most things - I've worked up 'mac'-n-cheese, etc… If needed, make the topping separate, the family can have wheat based pasta.


•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Cheap snacks:••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

••Google the cheapest chip brands (potato and tortilla) in your grocery market - most likely at least one of the brands is gluten free. Mix sour cream and seasonings to make a variety of dipping sauces. 

••Instant pudding - make sure your store-brand is gluten free, and is good for two or three deserts (or one good movie)

••Popcorn - google 'brown paper bag popcorn' for a bunch of recipes


•••••••••My go-to snack:••••••••••

Open a can of black beans, add a glop of salsa, and a bit of cumin (like I said, I love that flavor!) - stir it up, dip your chips - best thing ever - I use it as a snack or as a meal.


••••••••••••'Ramen'•••••••••••••••

Use bouillon and make two cups of broth - throw in some vermicelli rice noodles (or other cheap rice noodles) and cook - when the noodles are almost done


••••••••Super easy, baked potato recipe••••••••

Stab a bunch of russet potatoes with a fork several times - they only needs a few stabs, cook in oven at 350º for an hour on a wire frame (I'm lazy, so I just use the built in rack)

This yields perfect baked potatoes with delicious skin and flakey guts, used sparingly, cheap. Store in the fridge up to a week, takes just a few minutes to microwave and enjoy.


•••••••••••••••••••My guilty (lazy) pleasure•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Frozen indian food (some of the brands are gluten free) - I microwave it up

Lastly

•••••••••••••••••••Shepherd's Pie (A lot more work


•Mashed potatoes•

Chop up potatoes (a bunch, add water enough to cover them, plus about an inch. Put onto the stove on 'hi' heat. Start on the meat mixture, but after about 10-15 minutes, try stabbing the potato cubes with a fork - if the fork 'cuts' through easily, they potatoes are done cooking. Drain in a colander, put back in the pot, some salt, adds a little flavor and color.


•Meat filling•

Anyway

Chop 2 to 5 carrots up (cheap, cook on medium heat (high enough that it cooks, low enough it doesn't burn while you're chopping up other things.) 

Chop up an onion

Add a pound of beef ( I like 80/20 because it's not ALL fat

Cook

Add enough chicken bouillon (or better than bouillon) to make a cup worth of chicken broth. Don't add the water for that

Add a tablespoon of tomato paste.

Add a teaspoon of GF worcestershire sauce, add fresh or frozen (or canned then drained) corn and/or peas to the mixture. If you didn't have whole garlic, add about a ½ tablespoon to a tablespoon (to taste) of powdered garlic.

The mixture should be about the consistency of a thick stew - if it's pretty watery cook at low temp


If it just won't thicken up (I don't know why, use about a cup of water, bring it to a boil, then add about 2-4 tablespoons of corn starch, whisk it until it's all dissolved, you should have a gel (if not, add a bit more corn starch, whisk until the cornstarch is all dissolved. Add the gel to the meat mixture and stir in - it should help it thicken up.  


•Assembling the pie•

Take your casserole dish

Throw this into the oven at about 400º for about half an hour.

Recently some friends and I have started working on an outreach project called ""Eat. Taste. Live."" ""Eat. Taste. Live."" is our attempt to not only help those with a gluten-intolerance but to also educate other people about celiac disease. In doing so

www.eattastelive.com

ETL came about when our chef's father was diagnosed with celiac disease several years ago. Since then, homemade meals that are not only good but good for them. As long as you have access to an internet connection? You're right in the kitchen with us interacting with our chef and our guests, nationwide and internationally.

The actual class functions on a pay-what-you-want system. Our chef made a helpful video explaining that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUcAR6vYqQ However

For samples of what kind of food we'll be making

We're also bringing in guests to our studio to be on air with our chef.  The guests for our premiere are actress Taryn Southern and entertainer Joel Bryant. You can find them on Youtube

We're trying to reach as many people as we can to let them know this resource is out there for them and we're willing to help. We're ready to prove how easy it can be to make amazing food that's still healthy.  

If you have any questions and/or suggestions let me know.  

EDIT: We heard your feedback loud and clear and have agreed that the previous hosting site was too complex and misleading.  Therefore we have since moved so that our class is strictly pay what you want.  No $5 minimum purchase required. We will be running strictly on the pay-what-you-want system to make it even more readily available.

The other people I know with celiac disease seems to have the opposite problem; they've gained weight and can't lose it.

I am thankful that the first test he ran was a Celiac blood panel

My problem is, or have symptoms that never abate, or a laundry list of other food sensitivities and allergies.  I feel like I'm in a weird no man's zone for this disease, and the only other people out there who have it are much younger or older than I am, and have had very different experiences from mine.

I've been gluten free for just short of two weeks now.  I am a bit in food mourning

I just want some hope.  I need to know that some people get better and live a normal life that's not filled with fear and sickness.  I know that my recovery won't be exactly like anyone else's, lay it on me, please.

I was told back in September, I hadn't prepared for the test properly and had one again a month ago.

When the procedure was over the Doctor told me the pattern showing on my small intestine was a tell-tale sign of a gluten allergy but now my results have came back clear.

I'm pretty upset at the moment because I've been eating a gluten free diet and feel much better. When I eat gluten I feel very sick. 

I'm also worried because if I don't have a gluten allergy then I'm not sure what's up with my insides.

What I have an issue with is the seemingly incessant need to *get stricter* in order to maintain the results of the initial cutting-out-of-gluten.  As my mother encourages me to try out gf for my own digestive troubles, I'll just find gf substitutes and everything will be fine (and maybe I'll have cheat days!) --&gt; okay nevermind no cheat days --&gt; whoops, gluten is in more things than I thought!  Gotta be careful about that oatmeal --&gt; cross-contamination is an issue, so no restaurants ever --&gt; nothing is acceptable to eat or put in mouth unless it has been tested for gluten --&gt; must be another food allergy, cut out another food (and repeat from beginning, but now with onions).

I'm not arguing that that progression has really been what my mother has needed to keep herself from feeling ""glutened"".  I don't even care if, and she still has the runs every day...and most gluten-free fora are not giving me a much more encouraging picture.  Seriously, her doctor recommended completely renovating our kitchen to avoid cross-contamination.

Even if, I'm not seeing a lot of reason to cut it out.  I've obviously built up some sort of tolerance (the state of my bowels is already substantially better than the state of my mothers'), and the idea of losing that tolerance to the point where ""naturally gluten free"" *bags of rice* are possible contaminants is...remarkably unattractive.

1355960432.0,154xnu,Questioning my Celiac diagnosis: is anyone else largely asymptomatic? Could I be a false positive?,,14,1,37,"I was diagnosed with Celiac's (through a blood panel) about 4 years ago after suffering from severe fatigue and sort of vague, and I like cake/pizza/pasta.

I'm starting to question my diagnosis because I don't really exhibit many of the symptoms that are the bane of everyone else in this subreddit's existence. No explosive diarrhea, etc. The only gastro-intestinal symptom I really seem to get is **severe** bloating. I can gain as much as 10 lbs/5 inches in one day in bloat alone, which at this point in my life I've just gotten used to. It has become so normal that it's not much of a gluten deterrent. My major symptom was (and still is) pretty severe fatigue and frequent brain fog, which going gluten-free doesn't seem to help.

I'm just curious if there's anyone else out there that is almost asymptomatic but has tested positive for Celiac's. Has anyone heard of a case of a false positive? What are some atypical symptoms of Celiac's that I might be overlooking? What are the consequences of continuing to eat wheat despite having no discernable symptoms?

TLDR: Is anyone else asymptomatic? What could wheat be doing to me even though I don't have many discernable gastro-intestinal symptoms?",,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/154xnu/questioning_my_celiac_diagnosis_is_anyone_else/

**A:** Activated yeast prevents gas or at least not as much
   
   Add a pinch of sugar to the yeast mix and let it sit for 30+ minutes. 

   It should start to bubble (meaning the yeast are alive). 

**Q: It sticks BAD

**A:** Rub some olive oil on the aluminum foil before putting the dough down. 

If you still have trouble use Reynolds Wrap Non-Stick Aluminum foil. 

**Q: I have made several pizzas

**A:** Sandwich the dough between 3-5 overlapping sheets of Stretch-Tite Plastic Wrap. As the name suggests it will stretch, and 3 double over lapping sheets on the bottom. 

Flatten the dough starting in the middle

**Q: How long can you store it

**A:** Generally I make a pizza that day and only store it in the refrigerator if I am going to use it the next. Any longer and you should cut it into portions

1 package makes 3 small pizzas (fits better on the tray)  and I wrap it in the Stretch-Tite/Plastic bag.
