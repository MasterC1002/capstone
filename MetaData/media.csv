1317832549.0,l1upr,Please help bring attention to inaccurate news reporting the Occupy protests,greg_lw,15,3,4,"I'm cross-posting this here

Let's start at the beginning.


First -- NPR, after over 80 arrests, involving the NYPD indiscriminately crop-dusting crowds of protesters with mace under no discernible provocation, executive editor Dick Meyer finally responded to the criticism accusing NPR of an on-air blackout by [explaining](http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2011/09/26/140815394/newsworthy-determining-the-importance-of-protests-on-wall-street?ft=1&amp;f=17370252) that ""the recent protests on Wall Street did not involve large numbers of people, prominent people, a great disruption or an especially clear objective.""

The New York Times was a little quicker to the draw, but trusting their quality reporting, I suspect it had something to do with corporate personhood or capital punishment. ""The group was clamoring for nothing in particular to happen right away,"" according to Ginia Bellafante. 

At about 2 AM Eastern Time on the night following the 700 arrests on Brooklyn Bridge, and then again swapped it out it with an Obama-speech [front page headline](http://i.imgur.com/tfAPx.gif) by 8 AM Eastern. A small, inconspicuous link buried further down the page was titled ""hundreds ticketed in Wall St. protest."" Again, I suppose I misunderstood when I read first-hand accounts of how they were kettled and arrested in droves. As it turns out, they were just ticketed.
 
CNN has just been in a non-stop tantrum. They recently followed up with a televised piece so [venomous and condescending](http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/03/politics/occupy-wall-street/?q=meow) that it would make Bill O'Reilly blush. ""So, followed by more proclamations that this is nothing but a block-party for new-age hippies selling designer yoga-wear. Their continued reporting has followed in kind.

As far as I can tell

“I didn’t see anything illegal

""What happened to decency? What happened to corporations doing the right thing?"" -- contributer Sunny Hostin cried in indignation.

Unfortunately Brazilian media is an oligopoly controlled by 4 families: TV Globo (Marinho family)

Veja is, in the scare and smear tactics they use. They publish articles against the left-wing Brazilian government, and these reports are used by all other media outlets to attack Ministers and their families. Four ministers already left the government; and Veja was trying to do it again -- and they would succeed, if they were not caught.

If this happened in UK or USA

We need your help to spread the news: Brazilian News of the World was caught

The Meaning:
1.) Right before the notebook puppet told the other puppets to write ""creative colors"" she showed them a board with a wheel of colors; green wasn't on that board, Green is NOT a creative color.""

2.) When the notebook puppet told the others to look out the window and look ""creatively, through the perspective of the notebook and her one eye.

3.) When one of the puppets actually created something really nice and ORIGINAL and creative--the picture of the clown--the notebook puppet had black ink smeared on the picture to obliterate it.

4.) When things truly got scary, indicating this is all manufactured by hollywood...ie the indoctrinating media.

5.) Then, telling you that the children's creativity and emotions are being taken by the media, ""gobbled up."" Basically, the message is supposed to be tragically ironic, because the light-hearted facade hides the sinister plot; on the outside, it looks like they're encouraging children to be ""creative,"" so the mood, and atmosphere is innocent and childlike...but the makers of this sketch are trying to tell you that there's something HIDDEN beneath the friendly facade, and then you feel fear as the evil is exposed underneath the light. THIS is the nature of children's cartoons; the dark beneath the light.

Don't you see? This is the perfect metaphor for how our children are being conditioned by cartoons and children's shows to think a certain way, but in actuality, they're teaching our children to be...puppets.

The media pretending Ron Paul doesn't exist despite his big showing in the Iowa Straw Poll (and [Jon Stewart's coverage of it](http://www.reddit.com/tb/jk51z)) is what really made me believe we need to do something.

Asking media to stop their biased reporting is an obvious approach

* They may lose viewers/listeners/readers.
* They may lose advertisers.

From here I can see two approaches:

* Inform readers/viewers which news sources are covertly attempting to influence them.
* Tell advertisers you are displeased with them supporting [biased news source].

Coupled with repeated admissions of ""intelligence"" problems from the State Department, etc). So, it was a Carter-like situation - consistent hounding of the administration, who obviously could not provide specifics due to the USA national security.

GOP cut funding to worldwide security:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-forget-about-big-bird/2012/10/09/5f9a411c-1258-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_story.html

And oh so ironically
http://www.mediaite.com/tv/obrien-asks-rep-chaffetz-about-vote-to-cut-embassy-security-funding-absolutely-we-have-priorities/

Media does not distinguish between consulate and embassy:
-An embassy is the main representation of a foreign country and deals with political issues as well as consular issues nationwide. 
-A consulate has a more regional focus and if it deals with political issues at all
Consulate security is where one has to work with LOCAL people.

CNN, CBS does not educate viewers - consequently, US has poor understanding of Asia/Middle East/Africa culture:
Libya is an unstable third world new nation, there is wrong information. It happens, and it is sad, but that is reality. It isn't like 9/11 where briefings were ignored. 
People don't seem to get this. The Middle East will not blow up. They are just starting to embrace democracy. 
If you go to any country like India or Pakistan, chaos, and people, and that's the way it'll always be. 
You can't impose your will on another country - they have to fight through their own problems if we want to instill democracy. 
But the intelligence problem in an unstable

Fact-checking is biased:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ftxe2x3cBM

I think they are driving a narrative for the sake of ratings and money.
With Libya, the ratings are going up, the public is 'infuriated', taxpayer money is wasted on hearings, and the Congress pretends to do something worthwhile.

Also - the media (CNN) found the Sensata story on 9/18 and is aware of it. One article came out: http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/18/why-romney-cant-save-the-sensata-workers/

Then they kept quiet to drive election narrative as a 'draw' - more advertisements

That's why today, etc. They keep it at a rat race on purpose. 

They don't fact check Romney for his flip flops:

1354146832.0,13yony,An open letter to the American News Media.,thornsandroses,10,2,3,"Dear CNN,

Since the re-election of President Barrack Obama, and videos showing Republicans lifting the fog of FOX NEWS. Just a few moments before I started writing this I saw a video of an avid fan of Bill O'Reilly. She was coming out of a movie theater and wanted to tell her story to a cameraman. She was a hard core denier of climate change and believed everything Bill O'Reilly said. Then she watched the movie ""Chasing Ice"" and she walked out of that movie theater a different person. She realized that she had been lied to. She realized that not only was climate change real but it's going to be devastating. It affected her so much she was going home to talk to every single person she had ever convinced climate change wasn't real, to undo the damage the lies she had unknowingly passed on did. 

Many of the new GOP freshman in Congress have now refused to sign Norquist's pledge, and Pat Robertson admitted the creationist model doesn't fit reality and science is real and true. Every day people are waking up across the country.

That's what brings me to you guys and gals in the media. Now is your time to shine again. Now is your time to take the bull by the horns and fix a system you know is broken. It's time to bring ethical journalism back. It's time to turn the clock back to the fact based investigative journalism of America's media hayday. Names like Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Diane Sawyer, Edward R Murrow, all bring to mind a time of great journalism, where trust was given because trust was earned. A time when if a news anchor said in a broadcast something that turned out to be untrue, Americans called them on it and the anchor, went out of their way to take ownership and issue a retraction prominently in an update on their news cast. A time when journalists took pride in their work

We're not living in a time like that right now, and meaningful news. Some blame the internet for turning American's attention away from traditional news sources, but the opposite is true. We turned to the internet to get the true story behind the supposedly ""fair and balanced"" news stories. We soon learned that traditional media sources could no longer be trusted, and politics was driving too much of the information. News stories have been reduced to playable sound bites and partisan pandering. While I will never say you came anywhere close to being as bad as FOX NEWS in partisan pandering, you didn't go out of your way to ensure accurate reporting either. Too many times I can tell the political affiliation of a news journalist within moments of hearing them speak, and this is just wrong. News should be fact based only, and commentary and discussion should be based on faction evidence

We know you were bullied by FOX and we weren't there to back you up. FOX hammered and hammered you, and we didn't pay attention, mainly because we knew that wasn't true. But it was no excuse for you to give in to their demands and start allowing falsehoods and junk science to air without rebuttal. That was unacceptable and it's time you do the right thing.

I implore you all

Thank you",self,t5_2qhlk,1354193701.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/media/comments/13yony/an_open_letter_to_the_american_news_media/

Paul Farhi's tick-tock piece (http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html) posted at about 4:25 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, the paper had the best piece I've seen recently on his management strategy (http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/08/07/b5ce5ee8-ff96-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html). And this past Sunday, the paper had a stellar team-effort story with even more details on Amazon.com and Bezos' management style (http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/for-bezos-the-post-represents-new-frontier/2013/08/10/ba7cfeb6-013c-11e3-9a3e-916de805f65d_story.html). 

I wish that every major business executive and government official had such detailed reporting done on them.  Too bad there are not more reporters around to do it.

Whenever I want to get really angry

I've come to believe that the comments sections on UK news sites are cesspits of disinformation, trolling and bad manners: in short, the polar opposite of what we have here on reddit! There is simply no control on the signal to noise ratio. I think it reflects badly on a newspaper when the readership manages to portray itself in this light. This is the basic problem that I think reddit solves with threading and voting.

I only just came across the Independent reddit. It's really badly (not at all) integrated into the main site and it looks like 3 people posted there

What would it take to make it work? Do I give reddit too much credit as a panacea?
