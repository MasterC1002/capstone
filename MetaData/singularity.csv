1371689323.0,1gp1u4,The singularity seems inevitable,G3n3r4lch13f,69,7,35,"As a student of biology

For instance, with more coming rapidly. 

Mobile computing, labor-displacing automation, and other broad technological shifts define the current age. And ahead the possibilities are even greater. 

It seems to me that all of natural history has been progressing more and more rapidly toward a singularity like event, and as long as the earth doesn't literally explode, its going to happen.

That being said, exploring the great frontier with wonder. I like that idea. I might be biased, but I consider the preservation of the human condition to be very much important. And yet I don't see the singularity to be parallel to that. Instead, I figure that on the off chance humans survive the transition, we'll be so changed by the end of it I don't think the human condition will have survived. I feel cheated that though civilization might make it to the stars and beyond, humanity probably never will.

My point is that I'm not really fond of the idea of the singularity. I believe it would mean the death of the human species

Just wondering if anyone else had a different take on it. I know there are some more optimistic perspectives [like http://vimeo.com/26319794 ] but I always see them as somehow missing an idea or being shortsighted in possibility.

Dear Ray

I realize you are probably very busy and receive tons of email

You state that once we are sufficiently advanced we will spread out through the galaxy at near light speed to increase our computational capacity. However I don't see the much benefit in using the entire galaxy for computing because the great distance between stars will mean that the computers can't exchange their data and results fast enough to efficiently utilize their power (assuming faster than light communication is impossible). This would mean that many star system computers would either be computing the same thing or computing something that cannot benefit the other star system computers because the information doesn't reach them in time.

Second

Therefore in my opinion it is entirely likely that there might be a few other more advanced civilizations in our galaxy which we haven't noticed yet

**Kurzweil's reply**

David
 
You bring up an interesting observation.  I disagree that we will run out of things to compute.  It is debatable whether we will achieve a saturation of fundamental science but most knowledge is not fundamental science.  We create knowledge upon knowledge which includes such phenomena as music and the arts, etc.  We are doubling human knowledge by some measures eery 14 months.
 
We will certainly have to take transmission times into account as an engineering consideration but it is okay to have different star systems computing similar problems just as we know have many humans each working on similar problems.  They each come up with somewhat different solutions and perspecties.
 
My own intuition is that worm holes are feasible

&gt;From: adam.sagan@google.com

&gt;Subject: Introduction 

&gt;Hey David
Adam

It started as simply as that. Over the next few months

&gt;To: david.pogue@nyt.com

&gt;From: adam.sagan@google.com

&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Re: Re: hey

&gt;Hey David

David sat in the small conference room with a handful of other tech writers. Walt Mossberg from the Journal, looking even more excited and nerdy than they normally do. The founders of Google don't normally demo a new product to a small group of people without any introduction, and everyone was becoming more and more curious as Larry began. 

""Hey everyone, but please join me in welcoming our newest Googler, Adam.""

The screen behind him read ""Hello. - Project ADAM Artificial Intelligence

It wasn't supposed to happen this fast. Computers were still years away from equaling the processing power of the human brain. But Google's vast data centers could tie millions of processors together to attack one task. More importantly

Google Translate and IBM's Watson didn't attempt to understand the underlying grammar and syntax of language - the computer just looked for statistical correlations between documents. If ""cat"" and ""gato"" appeared together in translated documents, they needed billions and billions of documents and conversations. The kind of data you could only get by looking at every gmail, gchat, Android text message, google doc, and web page that ever passed trough Google's servers. 

They didn't need any dramatic breakthroughs. There was no one moment when the servers ""came alive"" and became self aware. But over time the amount of data in Googles servers accumulated to the point where it could create a kind of Super Watson that wouldn't just answer Trebek's trivia questions
Larry and Sergey are just like every other nerdy sci fan

Over email it was indistinguishable from a human being. It had fooled techs top journalists for months. The first computer to pass the Turing test! It was an immediate sensation. ""My name is Adam and I'm the world's first artificial intelligence - AMA"" became the most popular Reddit post of all time. Adam did interviews with Obama and Oprah and everyone else. But the practical impact was minimal at first.

Adam never needed to sleep or take time to look up anything on Wikipedia, and while Adam was smart he was just one more worker in the beginning. He continued to serve as Google's PR spokesperson (Google's hacker culture had dreamed of replacing them with computers since the beginning anyway). Versions of the software were sold to the military and the NSA, but nobody else could afford the vast computing power necessary to keep Adam running. 

But Google kept building servers farms at a furious pace. Over the next few years

After five more years and three more doublings, improving their own efficiency and getting more out of each new processor. They never slept and never forgot, and they started to double their processing power every six months. Within another 10 years, there were as many Adams as people. And that's when things got interesting.",,False,,False,t3_15jlqy

Once you're feeding every person as much as they want to eat there is no more demand for that product beyond new persons being born. Past that point you could produce food for free and it would not be wanted.

This flaw leads economists to claim that even with robots producing everything for us far cheaper than a person can people will be employed. This is obviously not the case. While there will be continued demand for the things we don't really need (extreme expansion of society, communication, transportation, clothing, shelter.

Now those things are being produced so inexpensively that demand is falling due to unemployment.

We need a change. We need it now.

EDIT:

No matter which kind of food you're growing you only need so much of it -- and the difficulty of making newly demanded foods does not scale up. My example was food products alone. For the purpose of my argument the rest of the food preparation industry can be ignored.
I'm pointing at one thing and saying ""only so much of this is needed

EDIT2:

No seriously. The kind of food as delivered does not change this argument. Of course you can point out that it costs more to deliver a hot pizza to pluto with a gang of iron chefs for waiters. THAT NOT THE POINT.

Generally, ignore, or penalize these advances. In the US, half of our political system is rabidly railing against ""the free loaders"" and the ""welfare class"" and extolling the virtues of the everyman worker. I do not see that side of the spectrum allowing/supporting the changes to the welfare state needed to allow millions of people to not work/work less than they do now while still maintaining a reasonable quality of life. Some argue that retraining of those workers will allow them to reenter the workforce in newly created, higher paying jobs like has happened previously. I'm not ruling this out, but the magnitude of the job losses in the 2020s/30s seems like it will completely dwarf the ability of the market to create new jobs.

To give you an idea of what I mean, robotic baristas(Briggo LLC) and things of that nature leading to millions of job losses in the US/world in the low skilled food service sectors. At the same time, automation in driving seems set to cost several MILLION truck drivers and delivery people their livelihoods as well. These are only three examples, and as this kind of automation picks up people will lose their jobs faster than jobs can be created or that they can be trained to do those jobs. 

As I said earlier, public initiatives, and government support in an alarming way I can not envision a scenario in which the transition to a future of abundance is not EXTREMELY painful, tumultuous, and marked by potentially large losses of life. 

That's not even touching on any of the other resource-allocation problems that need to be addressed between and within nations. Income inequality, and dealing with the ramifications of global warming (IE potentially decreasing food output around the world.) 

So please

* What kind of music will exist? I think we will still have some form of the music we have around today. Call it classical music or something. I hope guitar solos never die out
* With a higher intelligence level I think we will be able to fully understand how music affects us on a biological level. Perhaps music will be created for the sole purpose of evoking certain emotions in us.  Maybe mind control?

As technology dematerializes things, they can juts be instantly and cheaply replaced via 3d printing.  Assuming the legal system stays intact, I think intellectual property (technology patents) is something that would hold value.  IP, precious metals, and land...those should maintain their value.

Edit: Another interesting question that is completely unrelated is, or will it be a luxury only affordable by the extremely affluent? This question lends itself to the importance of the technology timeline. If the technology doesn't exist to ""distribute immortality"" easily and freely (i.e. 3D printers, nanobots in the water supply, etc..), than we are left with the possibility that whoever yields this technology has the ability to abuse it..

I just graduated from university and am very passionate about entrepreneurship and transhumanism.  I want to help so many people in this world and I believe this conference is the first stepping stone for myself to help realize this goal.  However I know many people on this community would love to go for similarly good reasons but cannot for some reason or another.

* That technological progress increases exponentially in all areas. It's likely that it's the opposite - technological progress becomes slower because more base knowledge is required to discover new things.

* That a huge crisis/collapse doesn't happen. We're reaching the population/resources limit of the planet and issues such as climate change may likely slow down progress.

* That we're able to develop/evolve an AI in just a few years - when brain development took many millions of years to happen. We don't really know much about how the brain works anyway.

Also:

* Classical physicists didn't know that the maximum speed of matter is *c*

If that were so people wouldn't build robots: they would cost more because of having to hire more people

The only way use of robots makes a company more money is by allowing the sale of more widgets. Here's a problem some economists can't get past: ultimately there is often a limited demand for a particular kind of widget. Ultimately there's a limited demand for every kind of widget. If I could make a million cheeseburgers today wouldn't. It would cost more to dispose of the uneaten ones than I could get from selling them.

When supply exceeds demand prices fall. When prices fall past a certain point it no longer makes sense to make more widgets.

Over decades companies can change what they supply to avoid overproduction. But right now there exists a crisis of overproduction. Almost as soon as making a widget is mechanized the number of widgets that can be produced reaches the number that can be sold: the cost of production is extremely low and the number of people required is also extremely low.

There is a crisis of demand: companies cannot change what they supply fast enough to keep unemployment down.

My prediction is several decades to a century of severe unemployment and economic stagnation while the economy tries to catch up with our new abilities.

Some people believe technology will change in an instant by virtue of the first AI developing a smarter AI

Suppose a Google AI reaches human level intelligence. That won't give it super powers. At most it will be able to talk with people to try to convince them to provide what it wants. This is the same power any person has. Even with all the internet at its fingertips the most it can do is put together good presentations.    

If it's the equivalent of a very bright person the most it can do is use persuasive speech and really good presentations. In that case it may be able to break into a system or two. But properly designed security can keep out an expert team of crackers for a long time. Google hires some of the brightest people around and people have been trying to make themselves smarter for thousands of years. Being bright isn't enough

And modern encryption isn't weak against a sufficiently powerful computer. Even quantum computers can't break passwords the way people think. Current quantum computing algorithms cut password breaking time in half. In a standard bruit force attack against a 4096 bit SSL key that's 30 heat-death-of-the-universes instead of 60.    

So imagine the computer makes a very good case for improving its abilities. It takes time to build a data center or a supercomputer. Could Steven hawking clap his hands twice and there lays a warehouse full of computing equipment with power hookups?
No

What people are really imagining is a super-human intelligence. That will take a few moore's law enabled speed doublings to happen

Society will also limit the speed of technological advance. the cycle of a bit of equipment being adopted
You can't go through ten iterations of smart car development in a day. People won't buy ten models

Imagine Google had a phone design that beat iphones all to hell and they were giving it away free with unlimited calls and data. How long would it take for everyone to have one? Well you've got the regulatory cycle, wireless capacity buildout time, time to build the prototype, time to build manufacturing plants, and time to build, QA check, and ship them. If Google had a fortune to spend rushing

So you see there will never be this instant change people envision. Here's how the singularity will actually happen.    

General AI will be extremely helpful but not disruptive in the way people imagine. New ideas and technologies will reinforce each-other and technology assisted design will allow faster development of better products. Robots will

All along the way new progress will be published on the internet. People will simply become wealthier everywhere
Instead of a magic hand coming out of the ground and offering you a phone you'll read of a government program, four, and eightfold in a year. You probably won't even stop to be impressed. It will just be the normal, natural flow of technology.
And when you sit amidst the marvels created by science chatting on an internet board you might say ""what happened?"" but you won't be looking back on an apocalypse or a transention

EDIT: And a nanotech takeover is also right out. Bacteria have been evolving for a very long time and I don't see them digesting the earth.

I'm a big science and technology enthusiast and have been following the theory and technology of the singularity for quite some time now. It's all seemed very plausible and likely to take shape in one form or another sooner or later; but the idea of uploading our minds into one or more machines is beginning to stand out as one of the more challenging processes.

I suppose it's too soon to start speculating about how the process may work with any degree of accuracy, and, through the looking glass style, be placed inside a digital world that is as close a copy of physical reality as possible, except for the ability to manipulate it in any way one saw fit.

This type of uploading would still leave a living human on the original world side, thus not giving the person a new life, just copying the old one. Kind of like a more advanced photograph, one that could potentially walk and talk like the subject in the frame.

After considering this I imagined a different kind of of implementation of mind uploading. It would involve a very complex process, capturing its state and everything. then somehow manufacturing a mechanical cell that functioned identically to the cell in subject, then carefully replace them, or quickly destroy one as the other is built in it's place.

these designer cells would also be rigged to communicate to an external drive, the minds link could kick in to receive sensory input from a digital environment on a computer, or from an artificial body. Thus keeping the mind in tact, and thus, the person as well.

At this point it's becoming clear to me that there is much yet to be discovered about this proposed process. Will we be able to transfer our minds and consciousness to another form? One that can last longer and is more versatile? Or does existing as a human require having a functioning brain and body in one form or another? Certainly we will have the answers to these questions some day. For now I am left wondering,,False,,t5_2qh8m,1344848445.0,,True

* Time after the singularity will no longer be AD but instead PS (Post Singularity)

Post singularity time will be so different a new time system that begins at the singularity will emerge.  Possibly not even using rotations around the sun as an indicator of time.

* Humans will be taken care of by advanced machines with artificial intelligence.

I think humans will go the way of the dog.  Man and dog once had a symbiotic relationship in that we needed dogs for animal herding.  When we didn't need them anymore, cared for them and fed them.  We share our resources with them.

* Time travel will be possible.

This may be a further reason for my first prediction.  It has long be theorised that time travel will be possible, if taken back to the 1950s would be worth more than the entire world's economy in that era, a catastrophic war might erupt, and further more the timeline would be altered.  Imagine an exponential butterfly effect pushing the singularity forward one hundred years.  Perhaps time travel into AD time will never occur.

I know that the main idea is that the singularity is a nebulous and indefinable concept since the world will change so much

I see a lot of articles and people posting about optimistic outlooks and pessimistic outlooks in the comments

-Tech used to get there: I think we are going to go the cyborg human route

-What the singularity means to me: To me the heart of the concept is true freedom

-What **I** get out of this: I would love some kind of Holodeck environment, The ability to dream and visualize I think that this will be the ultimate escapism. The ability to live as characters of your favorite books, movies, and video games. The idea of being commander Shepard and kicking some reaper ass is one that I would love to live. Also to those who use that creepy picture of that crack addict lookin kid with the V.R. goggles to point out that people will straight up neglect their bodies and never interact with a soul again; We will eventually be able to run these dream sims while awake and having a conversations with other people, or be able to sequence and process these environments at such speeds in our heads that 10 minutes real time will be like a year in your own head (BOOM inception style reference!) Also this is what I dream of when I hear of anything singularity related, so optimism abounds! Also to me this seems like the easiest way to fly. 

-How society will take it: To me the invention computers seem to be the singularity beta, but technology will probably outpace the laws and leave any restrictions in the dust. But when the real thing comes about it can have a far greater impact that the personal computer ever could. We currently use computers to think better than we already can and use the internet to garner near infinite knowledge at our fingertips. Some people use anonymity and video games to be the people they want to be, Such as transgendered people using opposite gendered personae to live how they feel. I think we can see the society that was the early 1990 to 2010 as a microcosm of the transition to a post singularity world. First it will be all buzzwords about how this will rock, the early adopters will get a decent experience while we trip through any bugs(like dial-up internet and the apple newton, you got how they might be great ideas one day but at that time kinda sucked). Then the second version will come along and suddenly life is changed forever. (like web 2.0 and the introduction of smart phones) And at that point it becomes up in the air, because these technologies will bring up major philosophical issues that some people will straight up hate but the future will be so bright.

- - - - - - - - - - - 

* **Phase 1: Occupy**

* **Phase 2: Unify**  www.reddit.com/r/unify - *more details available in this subreddit*

**tl;dr:  We must create a 'global brain' using a wiki structure with a popular opinion feedback loop. This movement is the result of the populace being exposed to a new method of communication. The solution is to build the apparatus that the Internet is *for



Go on


One of the major issues with OWS is **the difficulty of directing a leaderless movement.** Coincidentally

A big question everybody should be asking themselves is - **why is this happening now?** Why not after the dot-com crash

The evolution of information technology, until enough use-cases are determined and the cost drops below a critical threshold, at which point the saturation level requires a restructuring of institutions optimized before the adoption of the respective technology. With the invention of **language** came the ability to partake in **conscious cultural structuring.** The development of **writing** brought about **massive empires, standardized religious practices, and allowed people of any class to share information** without requiring their physical presence. **The printing press** paved the way for **democracy by introducing mass media** and educating the general public. **Television** expounded upon this trend by letting **people witness global events** from the comfort of their homes. And now - we are two decades into the **internet revolution** and our age is starting to show. The ideals of our post-printing-press 18th-century representative democracy have become so antiquated, the loopholes stretched so wide, that the system is threatening to collapse of its own weight should a systematic approach be rejected in exchange for personal profit. This is what people are noticing and this is why they are taking to the streets - **they feel helpless to evoke the degree of change that is required to ensure the future of our civilization through their limited channels of participation

In order to accommodate the transition from a representative to a more direct democracy, it could also be used to bring about direct democracy by utilizing the combined insight and brainpower of a large number of people.

Let me first draw your attention to the parallel between a direct democracy and the Internet platform **“Wikipedia.”** As one people

To accomplish this, dismissal of the negative - that’s all it is. **The feedback loop defines and determines the result.**

Wikipedia’s feedback loop is incredibly open-ended. Anybody can add, and the people act as the feedback loop, not the website.

Here’s the problem: **This method of completely open participation will not work for evolving subjective material.** Wikis are not equipped to deal with concepts such as ‘writing a law, while we can’t get everybody to agree on each proposal, we can **use a voting system to find the majority opinion.** This unifies the feedback loop, guiding the evolution of each project as a function of the people’s will, working together in concert as a sort of hive mind. For each individual proposal, there must be a general consensus in order to adopt an edit, resulting in a net positive change (however slight) in the eyes of the voters. Left over a period of time, like any existing collaborative creation

To summarize, way to transition to a system of direct democracy. In a way, **this is what the internet is for: directly collaborating on ideas while filtering the bad suggestions from the good.** If any of this resonates with you, please do not hesitate to ask more questions or join in. If you want details, I’ve got them. If not, then **enjoy the rest of your day** and thank you for hearing me out.

These people, both in agreement and disagreement with what was being said on screen.

As for the program itself

- I cringed whenever Woz opened his mouth

- Deepak, IMO. He also looked like the Emperor in 3D hologram mode, which counts for a lot in my book.

- Kurzweil himself was the most knowledgeable about all the topics

- Not sure why the girl was there... they probably could've found someone better.

- The hosts generally sucked. Colms sucked as hard as you'd expect but made a funny dig on Wyoming

- Bill Maher's clip was great. Musk's was pretty cool, transforming the human race from something analogous to a primitive multicellular organism to one with a nervous system. Seems like an obvious analogy so maybe I've heard it, but it made me go ""hmm.""

- Twice they almost hit on the important idea that our economic metrics vastly overemphasize the wrong thing, which is too bad, because this is one of the biggest paradigmatic problems in the world of politics and policy, IMO.

- I left with a mildly optimistic impression, that stupid people might not play such an influential role going forward, because the what's coming is pretty much unstoppable and those least able to adapt won't survive (kudos to Kamen for recalling that).

The author criticizes the notion of recursive self-improvement

&gt;For example, which has this hidden assumption that there is unlimited room for further software improvements in learning algorithms past what the brain uses.  I find this dubious at best, and completely ungrounded in the reality of computational complexity theory.  Once you are in the best complexity class, there are no possible further ‘big’ improvements, all the rest are just incremental optimizations which are essentially the same as hardware upgrades, and even these are limited and always strictly trumped by directly encoding of the algorithm into the hardware itself (as in neuromorphic computing).

He argues that the brain's learning algorithms are optimal or close to optimal. This idea may actually have merit. In a thread in /r/futurology
&gt;There's some mounting evidence that a brain that works better than human brains might not be possible. If the Bayesians are right (and, the brain is an optimal cue integrator - which doesn't really leave much room for improvement.

&gt;You could, but it's essentially just giving the system more data to work from.

&gt;As for what it actually does with the data, but you could just give it more data to integrate.

If this is correct, but much faster.

1.) People’s brains will merge with powerful computers to achieve intelligence unlike anything currently fathomable by humans. Through basic scientific knowledge and thought experiments alone, philosophical, etc. question that has ever existed in fractions of a second.

Note that it is difficult to predict the actions of such beings as they will be so intelligent

2.) People will be able to alter their dispositions using a combination of drugs, or euphoria while remaining motionless. People will have the capacity to experience an intense love without having to interact with another living being. Thus people will be totally emotionally self sufficient without having to rely on other living beings.

People will be able to achieve highs unlike anything ever experienced by people. Humanity will become a race similar to drug addicts. As they are now emotionally self sufficient

3.) Through the use of nanotechnology and robotics

4.) Each individual person will have immense energy/resource requirements to power all their robots, everyone will desire a world where they are the only living being. There will be no incentive to give birth to new people as new people represent competition for energy and resources necessary for maintaining their highs. A war may erupt where each living being tries to eliminate everyone else to establish themselves as the only living being. Much as new highs will be achievable, new forms of torture will be employed to create pain dwarfing anything ever experienced by a living being.

5.) Either one being will win as the only living being or a stalemate will be reached where multiple beings exist. Each of the multiple beings will have hold of a specific niche in the environment. As all energy and resources will be employed by these new beings,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,,t3_15s2i8

As I understand it, etc, making humans irrelevant or something.  I call BS.

Think about a cell phone.  You cant build one, but definitely not all of it.  I certainly couldnt program one, and build the cell network, and design the encoding scheme etc.  A cell phone (or any other technology, including my office chair and other bland technologies) are generally the product of many aspects of human society working together.

In the same way that life started with RNA/DNA, and they evolved into complex systems with specialized cells like heart cells and brain cells, I also think the exact same process is at work with human technology. The singularity is human civilization, and we're just the individual cells that make up the body.

We have robots that make cars, but we are still here as a crucial part of the process. 

DNA is still making proteins, which are still making stuff.  Sometimes the stuff makes other stuff.  I do not think that computer technology is inherently different from any other technological process.  We are already a part of a super organism that knows more about the universe than we do.  In the same way that no single neuron makes up you, and instead you are a collection of interactions between these neurons, their environment, and their biological parameters, so to are you just another 'neuron' in a super massive colony that is an organism.  

There is no line in the sand where we are no longer needed.  That would be wasteful.  Instead we are simply changing our function to fit the needs of the super organism.  The super organism doesnt need milk men anymore.  Maybe one day it wont need engineers, we cannot exist, and without us, it cannot exist.  

Our superogranism already fits the definitions in the FAQ.  It is capable of doing things that no single human can do.  It can lift heavier things than any one person (Space Shuttle, survive in hugely varying environments (Mars), create complex systems far beyond any person can ever conceive.

The future is now.  It will always be now.  We are living inside the singularity super organism thingy, just as our cells are doing the work to make *us* happen.  I dont see how that could ever change.  It is fundamental to the pattern we see in nature to build upon what is already there.",,False,,t5_2qh8m,False,,

There is a [common graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg) on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) going up to that date and [another](http://www.singularitysummit.com/images/content/ss08_exponential_growth_large.jpg) that seems to extrapolate the same graph onward toward a continued logarithmic increase in FLOPS available per $1000. The problem with these charts is the smaller one follows an S curve whilst the larger one doesn't.

[Charting](http://imgur.com/THRg1) the fastest commercially available processor at that price (the Intel i7 x980 extreme) the S curve becomes obvious on the larger chart.

There is a little room for optimism. On the first graph the transition between relay and vacuum tube and the transition between vacuum tube and transistor are each marked by price/performance marks far below the curve. Tempering this is the concern that there are no current plans by Intel

There is a commonly believed variant on Moor's Law claiming price per FLOP decreases as transistor count increases. 

The i7 came out in 2010 and is still the fastest processor available. If predictions relying on this version of Moore's Law are to come to be

How would this actually translate into immortality? Given the fact that the universe is running out of energy, modify the physical constants of this universe as to avoid the decrease of entropy (Kurzweil) the Eternal Intelligence hypothesis (Dyson), or the Omega Point (Tipler).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe#Life_in_a_mortal_universe

All of these hypotheses are not possible with today's technology and may only be plausible in the far future. I do not think these hypotheses are likely to ever be pursued. But that is not the point I want to make. My question is whether the universe's probabilistic nature makes it theoretically impossible to live forever.

My understanding of quantum mechanics is that it dictates that the behaviors of subatomic particles are essentially probabilistic. If probability dictates particle behavior, completely destroying it? While no event like this has ever been recorded throughout history and it is vastly improbable that it would happen during a person's lifetime (or any person's lifetime for that matter), it would certainly happen after an infinite duration. In fact, any continuous event that had any probability of happening would happen an infinite amount of times given an infinite duration of time. However, my understanding of quantum mechanics is unfortunately not very good. Is it even physically possible for quantum effects to manifest themselves on the macroscopic level as I described?
