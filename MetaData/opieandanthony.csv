Fantastic. From pan flutes to astronomy to ripping on apple to heavy, making fun of Don Lemon, making fun of a fake prank phone call from a horse shit morning zoo show. 

Entertaining from start to finish. there were very few moments where i didn't know what was going on

there's some sort of jingle contest? whatever

I'm not gonna sit here and mention Stern

Started with Karaoke, he'll come up later) and Big A took turns singing songs. 

Then Ant went into the studio with a blonde girl, saw him pass by the camera but that was it... he left shortly after the karaoke started. 

As ant was in the studio behind the desk

Danny was verbally raped by almost every caller for about two hours. He did not take it well. Everyone took turns calling in, what do you do for work,"" followed by ""I work at rockstar"" ""I didn't want to work at O and A anymore..."" and he and Opie got into an argument supposedly at Patrice's memorial. From the little he said it had something to do with him feeling that Opie didn't have his back, I could be wrong here but thats what I think he alluded to. Overall he came across like a whining little girl, and made an ass of himself in front of his girlfriend and they both stormed off.

Then Wendy comes in


exhibit a: http://i.imgur.com/usrhWq9.png

I realize that isnt Big A, the answer was sometimes. I also asked if Jimmy would like her vagina... is it meaty, unfortunately the answer was no. We also found out such things as, she's not into bukkake's, she likes it doggy style, she is shaved, the curtains match the carpet... although its shaved. No anal. She wasn't wearing any panties... then she had to pee. I happened to be on the phone with her at the time, about ten minutes before this, whiped his mouth and sat down. 

I don't know how happy Anthony will be that there was interracial shannanigans going on in his studio... and on his chairs (you know how he gets with boogers let alone pussy juice) So as of right now Ant doesnt know this I don't think. Kinda funny. 

Anyways, one looked like a limp dick baldy pederast, which he was reminded by many callers, and the other had a sleeveless grey tshirt... he was a nice guy. 

Then around shit, and used that before walking into the studio. His nose was very runny, he explicitly said it was not from cocaine. He plugged the site @devincomedy but we called him Joe, so I really don't know whats going on there. He kind of livened things up a bit, took some calls... gave advice on stand up.. all the while looking like he was going to puke at any second. 

It ended with Joe and the sleeveless grey shirt guy not knowing how to turn off the tricaster, im leaving it on just in case. 

Anyways, because most of it was just kinda bullshit, with a few highlights, so it may be ""The Show That Never Happened II""

Also there's a rumor that Pat from Moonachie's girlfriend freaked the fuck out on the karaoke stage

&gt;Yesterday I received quite an unsettling youtube message from someone claiming to be a laywer for SiriusXm. The jist of the message was take down all O&amp;A related content, this person is a laywer. So I took it upon myself to call this person this youtuber claimed to be to make sure. Indeed this is the real deal, folks. The VERY nice lady told me SiriusXM is cracking down on us uploaders and that I am not the first, nor the last, she will be contacting (but not so ominously).

&gt;As a result, this is/was for real. 

&gt;SO, as they are somewhat useless at the moment heh. As for the show clips, those must unfortunately be taken down as well :(

&gt;I only ever wanted to spread the JOY that is the O&amp;A show, have a wonderful life and thank you for forever and a day for being the best!

This really sucks. It's one thing to take down full show uploads from new episodes but old shows and archives? This is how O&amp;A get promoted and make people support the show.

I think if we all contacted Opie

Note there is also a live mobile version.

Basically will be taking over for as long as I can

I am an audio engineer and very familiar with MP3's

I'm not awake early enough to hear the show live. so I won't have those totally amazing show recaps that GTAJ was providing for us

Please allow me to practice this for this week

That is all. Thanks @GTAJ for being awesome and for the past year of awesome listening!

Interns (mostly) are just dense and unmotivated. Most deserve the treatment they got. Po once ""lost"" girls ID's on purpose and then magically ""found"" them so he could drive to DC and return them in person. Every last person I had a beef with was well deserved and what you hear on the air is maybe 1% of what you actually know.   
          
&gt; My god there's tons. Once Op wanted Sirius to ""get their shit together"" and do another Animation festival. Mind you this was his idea in the first place. Price it out, who btw wants to be Stern so hard he demanded a 4 day workweek for himself. Not the show, just for him. This is also the same guy that leaves his own show at the stroke of 10 regardless of whats going on. Dude just packs up and abandons his own fucking show. And by the way, if it ever gets mentioned again, watch him say something about the ""skill sets"" of management.

* Show has started. Opie is finally all in with Zimmerman's trial. Rachel Jeantel is sassy
* Poor sweet little Jeantel is thoroughly bashed. Neck pillow
* Jeantel looks like Patrice as a tranny
* She's nowhere to be found on today's paper because she's a retard who's fucking up the prosecution's case
* The news blips ""cracker"" and ""nigger""
* ""Creepy ass cracker""
* The news bleeps ""cracker"" and ""nigger"" because Trayvon said it. When Zimmerman supposedly said ""fucking coons""
* Poor Jeantel get's mad during her testimony. Jim is consumed with rage for the press
* Internet
* They sing a song to Sydney
* They review twitter posts about precious Jeantel
* **SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION
* They are taking a call from a lawyer. He says that this comodo dragon Jeantel will be prep to show sadness today
* They start Aaron Hernandez talk
* Now they seem to be all in with this. Rumors and news reports are being discussed
* It was premeditated murder
* DOMA's decision by the Supreme Court means more weddings to attend. Jim is happy about the decision
* Sam knows all the gay bars
* **FIRST BREAK** - Jennifer Hutt calls in next. Today Colin will be in (they haven't mentioned it yet

* **Colin Quinn** is in studio
* Jenny Hut phone call (who's this bitch? She's from the media
* She tries to defend Jeantel and the prosecution's case. Chip thinks Jeantel looked zooted
* Ant gives Jenny a lesson on the legal matters of the case. Even with her account of the events
* Oh poor Jenny
* ""Jenny
* Jenny seems to be unable to counter any of the boy's points and want's to get out of the phone. Now they talk about Paula Deen
* Jenny denies ever using the nigger-word. Phone call is ended
* **They watch this video

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dvvHMM6TF50

* There was a 3 year old child on that room. This guy is still on the loose
* Colin points out that Jim said ""there was no need for that"". Bravo Jim
* Paula Deen's Matt Lauer interview is dissected. ""Are you a racist?"" - Watch out for Matt Lauer!
* Paula Deen's accent is the perfect racist accent
* Colin does an impression of Deen's black employers for some reason
* ""Never be honest about race"" - that's the lesson
* Colin looked like John Holmes 30 years ago. Hopefully he'll end up like him
* Matt Lauer is a sneaky bastard. Tries to undermine Paula Deen's gun point robbery story. ""Shut up
* Anthony says everyone thinks about the word ""nigger""
* Colin throws out a quote: ""C'mon folks
* Paula Deen doesn't participate in young niggas conversations. It's very distressing for her to know that young people say ""nigger"" all the time. Poor woman
* Discussion about white guilt in general. Opie thinks this will take time to change. Brilliant observation
* Chris Hansen new show should be ""To catch a racist""
* **Bert Marcus and Penhouse girls** next
* **SECOND BREAK**

* Bert Marcus in studio to discuss his documentary ""How to Make Money Selling Drugs""
* Colin: ""let's not act like 50 Cent is Henry Ford""
* Discussion about drugs. Not much to report... it's interesting I guess
* They talk about boxing and stuff... I'm not really liking this interview too much
* More documentary talk
* **THIRD BREAK**
* Colin is changing is entire schedule just to be on when Lady Di and Marion return to the show
* They remember when Lady Di and Marion went to the VMAs
* They return to sweet Jeantel, then)
* **Bill Burr** is on the phone! They discuss how sweet and beautiful Jeantel is really Patrice in drag
* Bill Burr starring with A-listers makes Jim physically ill. The new movie he's in, but don't blink during it, or you'll miss him
* Hernandez talk with Burr
* Big laughs are had because Colin makes fun of Bill. Bill reminds Colin of the Crocodile Dundy episode
* They all agree how the show has made everyone jaded and fondly remember horrific bits from the good old days
* Now Ant tries to discuss the Zimmerman trial with Burr. The others stay silent and Burr almost falls for it but quickly ends the discussion. Ant's obsession is amazing 
* Bill loves Chip. Bye bye Bill
* **Penthouse girls** are in and they're already showing tits. ""Nice figures on these gals"". They're Polish
* ""Russian? What are you? In a hurry? Tss tsss""
* These girls are good eggs. They ""lez out""
* The two sisters can't touch each other on film because it's illegal
* They start spanking each other
* Fuck
* Have you both sucked a penis together? -Yes. Is it weird for you? -No
* Jim touches boobs. Chip continues to bomb. Anthony loves their pussy
* Roland is said to want a lap dance
* There's the possibility for everyone to take a pic with Miley Cyrus
* Roland is offered a lap dance again
* These girls like beer
* Plugs for the girls. They are on the cover of Penthouse and will be at Head Quarters (?) tonight
* Chip ruins the mood again. Ant needs to go to the dentist, says Chip
* Plugs for Colin. Ant really needs to go. They spot Miley Cyrus and the **SHOW IS OVER**

- The Radio Wizard is introduced to the audience. They don't respect him already. The boys and staff talk about their traveling to Montreal

- Erock is introduced to the audience. He's fat but not *that* fat. They talk about his night briefly. Roland walks in with food. His plane and room woes are discussed. Jimmy farted on the plane.

-----

- *Jesse Joyce* (@jessejoyce) is in studio. He was banned from Canada for a while because of a DUI.
- He was pulled over by the cops and some black fellows turned on him. As riveting as this was
- *Colin Quinn* shouted inside the studio

- Anthony says any lawyer could extort John for his SNL money; as his wife would have been ""instrumental"" in his carer. He talks about his own past and all the money he lost during his divorce.

- blockquotes edited slightly (more padding and dark border color)
- question/exclamation alien changed to o&amp;a aliens
- opie &amp; anthony / sirius xm logo added to footer

to do:

- custom flairs (need to make some good icons first
- someone said the links are in the middle of the comment section

Want anything else added/changed

I know Sirius' management is pretty much retarded, is going to help the company. Outrage is a major, and probably most fool proof tool to use in the media. Howard, Rush Limbaugh, South Park and even the Simpsons have used it to gain mass appeal. If they let the boys do what they want, it will lead to more subscribers and bigger numbers for the show (The Opster will once again put up some numbers).

Today we'll learn how to record the show, with no user intervention set-it-once-and-forget-about-it style, so we don't have to rely on online sources, because they will eventually fail sometimes. 

This method will ensure faster show availability for you


This requires a live stream, why do you need this? Well, because I work when the show is on, so fuck you. I need my mp3 everyday to listen when I can!




##Let's start
*I'm doing all this using windows 8
__________________________________________________________________
**Things needed:**


* A PC  
* Windows
* Radiosure
* PC has to be on when the show starts
* A functioning online stream for the OandA channel (you can find this using google, because I don't know if it's allowed) Also, I don't know if this works  with official Sirius XM stream, this is only tested using a freely available 24/7 Opie and Anthony Channel stream. Of course, if the stream fails, everything goes to shit, but I've never seen it fail before

__________________________________________________________________

 


**1 -** Download and install **RadioSure** (free version) - http://www.radiosure.com/downloadz/  

**2 -** Add your OandA channel stream to radiosure (right click anywhere and select ""add new station"")  


**3 -** Check if your stream is working. Also

**4 -** Open radiosure settings (the wrench and hammer icon) and go to ""recording"". There select the output folder, deselect everything else, except ""allow direct stream recording"".  


**5 -** Now, from 6am to 10 am:

- 5.1 - Go to windows control panel and search for ""Schedule tasks""
- 5.2 - From the menu ""Action""
- 5.3 - Give the task an easily identifiable name like ""Fuck you Sirius, and make the rest of the settings like this:

http://i.imgur.com/OlRjb.png

- 5.4 - On the next tab, like this (every week day starting at 6am (you can set it to start at 5:55 so not to miss a second):

http://i.imgur.com/9gV41.png

- 5.5 - On the ""Actions"" tab, ""Start a program"". A new window will appear. Browse to your RadioSure.exe on the ""Program/script"" field.
Then, like this

    /record /source=""STREAM_URL_HERE_WITHOUT_QUOTES"" /mute /duration=255

- the **/record** tells radiosure to record a stream, **/mute** ensures that the pc isn't playing the show while it's recording (of course, you can remove this if you want, and the **/duration** is the number of minutes to record (the show lasts 4 hours, so it's 240mins, I have set it to 255 for it not to miss anything)

Everything should look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/mA4az.png

- 5.6 - On the ""conditions"", this doesn't work, the PC doesn't wake, because my motherboard is shitty in terms of power features. Please post if you have problems with this in the comments, because I've found a fix for me using another app.

Everything should look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/1R6C4.png


- 5.7 - On the ""settings"" tab, but it doesn't really matter.

**6 -** Now that we have everything set up, right click your task and select ""run"". Let it run for a few seconds, radiosure should run by itself and in tray, it's icon will appear with a red bubble, indicating it's recording. Now, stop the task by right clicking it and select ""End"".
Go to your output folder


**Here's a manual run of the task

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxSWIt4Bt0


(notice at the beginning, there's a nice mp3 file there). 

**7 -** That's it, radiosure will silently and automatically record your favorite show for you, so you'll have a fresh mp3 file everyday, no need for more fetching around online for a link!





FINAL WORDS: **PLEASE, this way we'll have a pretty good redundancy system, so no day will pass that no one has a link for the show.

1367702966.0,1dp5rk,For the listeners who jumped ship from Hoo Hoo to O&amp;A at what point did you start seeing through the BS.,megan_slaw,31,7,53,"I stumbled across Hoo Hoo's show back in 2007 when i was browsing Demonoid

It's almost a cliché to say it but it took a very sharp drop downhill when Artie left but i stuck with it thinking that he wouldn't renew the contract at the end of 2010.

When the contract was renewed and it was announced he'd do less shows i saw that almost all the people on fan websites and forums were incensed by this yet the callers who phoned in the show all said things like ""oh i don't care even 1 show a week would be worth the money I'm paying"". I realised he was purposely only putting through kiss ass callers who are the kind of fans who ring up every day and wait on hold just on the extremely rare off chance they get put through yet there was probably a lot of annoyed subscribers being left on hold till they either hung up or the show ended and 
were cut off.

I carried on listening but noticed little things like Robin was pretty much only on the show to cackle at anything Hoo Hoo says and Sal and Richard who are the funniest people on that show are hardly used as much and when they are Hoo Hoo is always stepping over them almost asserting his dominance. I would read all the time that Hoo Hoo is a great interviewer yet all he seemed to do was stamp all over everything anyone said until they either told him they were abused as a kid or that their wife/girlfriend does anal.

I completely gave up on the show when Hoo Hoo started doing AGT and whenever there was new show it would basically be.

1st Hour: AGT Talk
2nd Hour: Completely petty and uninteresting staff squabble over the most mundane issue
3rd Hour: Celebrity guest who gets stepped over constantly (Tom Sizemore saying don't Stern me summed this up nicely)

I had heard the name Opie and Anthony but like a lot of Hoo Hoo's fans who have never even listened to a full show was under the delusion perpetuated by Hoo Hoo that they were clones of him. It was whilst listening to some Louie CK clips on Youtube i was linked to omgwtfitssteve's Louie CK on O&amp;A: 01 - Snake in the Ass episode. I gave it a try and was amazed that not only was it a very funny show it also had fuck all resemblance to Hoo Hoo's show. I'll admit i was a 
bit shocked at first hearing Jimmy's style of comedy but that soon passed and the way guests are pretty much treated as 4th mic rather than having to fight through Hoo Hoos interruptions to get a joke out.

I noticed on any OandA Youtube clip where they are talking about their dealings with Hoo Hoo the comments section is full of Hoo Hoo's fans attacking O&amp;A mainly out of the same deluded loyalty i was under and I just wish they would have a listen to 1 full OandA show before perpetuating the myth that they are Hoo Hoo clones.

I have to say though that when i heard Hoo Hoo lost his final appeal against SiriusXM i was laughing so hard at the fact he's got another 2 and a half years of that eating away at him,000. I did listen to the clip of him moaning about this and i can honestly say that its the funniest 30 minutes of Hoo Hoo's show i think ive heard.

Saturday Night Virus was an open format show that ran between 2007-2008 on Saturday nights from 9:00pm -- 12:00am

Between Louis CK berating callers, Saturday Night Virus displayed some of the most entertaining radio in broadcasting history. I'm sure most of you are aware of its existence, but if not take the time to check out the shows that were a part of this project, and it still bugs the shit out of me that this went away.

However, and even posted in this very subreddit.  One call I had with the guys was over 20+ minutes long on-air.

Anywho, I'll call up maybe once every two or three months.  I'm simply kind of annoyed at Sal's lack of understanding of the show and professionalism when handling the phones. 

Every screener prior to Sal has answered going ""What's your name and where are you calling from?""  Sal refuses to do this.  He'll answer quickly with either a quickly spoken and hard to listen ""O&amp;A"" or just a ""hello.""  He hangs up mid-way through your first sentence about your call (which doesn't allow the punchline to get out)

O&amp;A have always prided themselves on being a listener friendly show

Jimmy probably told over 1 hour and 45 min of original, despite how ridiculous. Not only does he provide the laughs, but the social commentary that we are all so used to on the show demands attention and respect. 

He had ridiculous bits on trannys and massages (happy endings?) while also using very serious current events (Aurora/Sandy Hook/Federal Gov't) to allow people an opportunity to laugh instead of grieve or get pissed off. (Serious I know

My favorite part is when he turned into Chip Chipperson without any warning and some ppl just did not get it. HYSTERICAL! Chip's improv was as stupid

Personally, my seats were upgraded 3 rows closer and in the dead center of the theatre. As I was told by Mistress Carrie on Friday (I work at WAAF) some serious shit when down when Opie and Anthony were banned from Boston inside the station and bad blood was split everywhere.
