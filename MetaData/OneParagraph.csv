In a fog of adrenaline, and covering my face with rancid kisses. Her name was Claudia Rossellini, an eccentric Italian billionaire. Every year she comes to my ranch house outside of Chicago for a surprise visit to “the man who saved me, that wonderful Georgio!” She never calls in advance, she uses all my hot water, and she terrifies my children with her halitosis kisses.

And we hate them and hate them and hate them and hate them. And blame them for everything. And watch their acid-tongued exchanges when they forget that we are listening, their scathing withering remarks, even as, with the same breath, they tousle your hair and tell you you’re so special.

You make some attempts to change. Learn an instrument, but somehow life moves along about the same as it always has.

**Challenge [2.33]: Conspiracy**

So

This week I discovered a subreddit called /r/hailcorporate. It's pretty interesting. Basically it's devoted to calling out posts that seem like they could be viral marketing by companies. It's all pretty conspiratorial

How about some stories about conspiracies?!

They could be anything. 

Two kids plotting a water balloon fight? That's a conspiracy

Plot to destroy the world's largest tire to collect insurance money? Conspiracy

Covert military operation gon awry deep in enemy territory? Conspiracy

There's a lot you can do with the concept of a conspiracy

When I was a child I covered my bedroom walls with pictures from Sports llustrated. I would spend hours staring at them and dreaming of when I myself would stand in front of a roaring crowd,000 delirious fans. In middle school, it dawned on me that a bench warmer on his senior league baseball team would probably never make the Major Leagues. So my ambitions shifted to something more modest: professional tennis player. Fewer people played tennis (so it seemed to me) so that would give me a better shot. For six weeks after school, I placed my $25 kmart tennis racket and some squishy balls from a yard sale in my backpack and biked across the campus of the local university to hit balls against the side of a quasi-deserted building. On the way I passed actual tennis courts which had been long since abandoned, the green surface a spider web of cracks, filled with tufts of grass. No matter, in a few years, my parents paid for tennis lessons from a middle-aged man from our church. The first lesson was horrific. Despite my hours of solitary practice, the lesson ended and I ran home sobbing. That night I tore down every single picture on my wall and started working furiously on a novel about that day’s disappointment

What happens when one finally takes the plunge to satisfy a temptation - was it worth it?

I want to see stories about that exact thing. We've all been there. These are feelings worth exploring because more often than not we never get satisfied in the way we wanted to be. Many times caving in to temptation takes us somewhere other than we thought it could. It takes us to places that we didn't know existed. It takes us to places that elate us

1344216422.0,xqodp,ANNOUNCEMENT: Hello from two new mods and bringing back the weekly challenge [2.1]. ,jmn357,14,4,2,"**Hey there /r/OneParagraph

We're jmn357 and lucidenigma and we're two new mods here. We're just getting settled in and figuring things out. In the coming weeks we're looking to reinvigorate the subreddit.

First though

**jmn357:** 

Hey ya'll

I've been a redditor for over three years and have been a long time submitter to /r/OneParagraph. It's one of my favorite Reddit writing communities. I work full time

Why mod /r/OneParagraph?

It's always been a place for me to hone specific ideas. Flash-fiction like this is a skill that makes you a better writer

As a writer I've always found it easiest to write about relationships (of all types). The simplicity of interaction is one of my favorite things to explore. As far as influences my greatest would have to be Haruki Murakami.

 

**lucidenigma:**

Hello everyone

I'm one of the two new mods and extremely excited to spruce up this subreddit. I've been a redditor for about a year and a half now and only recently have I become involved with writing communities such as this one. I'm a college student in Cambridge so I'll have ample free time to devote to /r/oneparagraph.

I decided to join this subreddit because I believe the first step in becoming a great writer is building a sound foundation. Mastering the art of filling a single paragraph with depth is an essential part of this process. As a philosophy concentrator I love the psychological and sub-conscious struggles characters have and it is what I enjoy writing about. Authors like Faulkner and Hemingway have distinctly impacted my style in this way.

Anyways

**We also need some help from you:** 

What we're asking for first is someone who is a CSS wizard to help make a new theme for the subreddit. I think we're edging towards a cleaner, or have seen a design you like.

We also want you to be active! 

Submit! 

Comment! 

And don't be afraid to crosspost something you post here somewhere else if it's relevant. We're looking to get traffic up a bit so more people can see the quality writing that's here

**New Challenges:**

We will backlog the first generation of weekly challenges on the sidebar. Because it's been so long since one was posted

It should look something like this:

""[2.1] The title""

Now...

The actual challenge.

**[2.1]: Retail**

Retail: 

Many of us have had crappy retail jobs. You know the one, but you've all been to stores and had experiences in them. Some are good, some bad, and sometimes you have experiences you weren't expecting when you made that run to get AA batteries for your remote.

So, and the realities we all deal with when we spend our money.

Is it a story about a politician? 

An allegory for some political doctrine you believe in or disagree with? 

A snarky tale mocking politics you see as silly? 

A cynical piece about the never-ending stream of disappoints we get from most politicians? 

A tale of a second-grade class election gone horribly wrong thanks to Julie Jenkins smear campaign accusing Timmy Thompson of being an anti-cootie vaccine nose-picker?

So, and hugging your friends tight because you've made it through another year together.

This week I want you to write stories based around the general idea of a ""new year"". This can be taken pretty broadly. You could do something specific like a story in a New Years party

Take it wherever you want but keep the idea of a ""new year"" in there somewhere.

On that note: enjoy the new year

**Challenge [2.12]: Truly Terrifying**

Halloween is upon us. That means scary movies

Scary stories can be fun. 

But that's what I want you to avoid. 

Avoid scary stuff that's fun, or unreal. I don't want to see stories about vampires, ghosts, or axe-murders.

I want to see stories about things that are actually *truly terrifying*. 

The sort of shit that makes people stay up late at night. 

The sort of shit you bury deep inside. 

The sort of shit that festers within you.

The sort of shit you that makes your body tense up as you fall into a deep anxiety attack. 

What do I mean then by truly terrifying things?

*Dying unloved and alone*

*Realizing none of your friends really care about you*

*Agonizing over your fear of death*

*Crippling social phobia*

*The blinding ignorance of the masses*

*The facade you've created around yourself*

*Settling down because you stopped caring*

*An unfulfilled life* 

*Sadness that prevents you from leaving your bed*

*Regret that weighs down on you every day*






Writing story about a psychopath or some M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist... that's been done to death.

Let's hear stories about the things that scare us everyday. The fears we deal with constantly and rule us.

And in this ideal world we would do nothing but eat pastries, play tennis, whiffle ball and go swimming and read books that we liked and occasionally have sex with beautiful women without things ever getting weird or awkward afterwards. And then in the evenings we’d play cards and music and sit around big bonfires and laugh and tell stories.

Conventions.

I don't mean cultural norms. I mean *conventions*. You know

But every weekend all across the country in civic centers and hotel lobbies people *convene*. 

Southern Baptists, comic book lovers, or swingers. They all get together and share a little piece of themselves with each other. For many it's a chance to bond with others over something they obsess about alone. It's a chance for people to come out of their shell, to meet, to talk, and to revel in something they love. It's a place for them to be vulnerable without fear.

**The Alcoholic** 

The alcoholic writer is a trope is old as fiction itself. So let's move a little past that to something more general: The alcoholic as a broad character. 

Simply put this week I want to see stories about alcoholics. We've all known one in our time

This is pretty general and you can do a lot with it. Are you writing from the point of view of an alcoholic? Someone dealing with an alcoholic? Someone in the depths of a bender? A person five years sober having a moment of weakness?
