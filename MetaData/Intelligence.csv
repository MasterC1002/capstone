&gt;Running analysis at the airport makes sense because the team would have

&gt;the team members at each hotel based on their passports

&gt;However

&gt;A Mossad team would be extremely aware of placement of security

&gt;participate in an assassination of a HVT in an Arab country would be
&gt;highly trained and prized. So from this we can assume that she is
&gt;either a throwaway in the team or that this isn't a major league

&gt;Either this was not an Israeli hit or the Israelis sent a second tier

This is a serious affront to the concept of national sovereignty, because:

1: The seizure of  military assets by agents of a foreign power (military

2: Most countries can only be sued in their own courts. Any ruling made in a Ghanaian court should be therefore invalid vis-a-vis  deciding the ownership of Argentina military vessels.  

3: The defaulted sovereign debt was probably issued under Argentine law. That would make its either the default or the 30% restructuring perfectly legal. *This is why sovereign debt carries a risk premium in the first place*

If I were the Argentine president

Civilians in the employ of the creditor would be arrested are tried in Buenos Aires on international piracy charges using the definition of pirates established under law of the sea.  Surrendered Ghanaian military personnel should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention.
