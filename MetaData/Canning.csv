1342020669.0,wdzx9,How Canning saved my life...,a_c_munson,130,10,34,"It was 1994. I found out I was pregnant. I had had 2 negative pregnancy tests and when I got a positive one I went to the Doctor and found out I was 3 months pregnant. A few weeks later I turned 22. 

The ""Dad"" had a Daughter with his EX by June and at the end of July they went on a Trip out of state to visit relatives.

It was August in Minnesota. August in Minnesota is HOT. I Lived in a very old House that did not have any kind of air conditioning.  IT was sweltering. I am out of work and pregnant.  I am alone while my ""Boy Friend"" is traveling with his Ex. ( Over the course of this trip
 A family friend who has a small apple orchard had gifted me with 3 bushels of apples.  I didn't start canning until after 10 pm. I have always been a night owl and with the heat it only made sense to be canning at night.  I am canning apple sauce. I sterilized the Jars

Oh SHIT! my water broke.  I call my Doctor then I call a friend she come over and we wait for a Cab to pick us up and take us to the hospital. I get to the hospital and they rush me to the maternity floor. No contractions yet so That is good but I am only 29 weeks pregnant. Through out all of this I feel fine

I see the Doctor

  My Mom has arrived and she is asking questions but they don't have a lot of answers. They give me a neo-stress test and I failed. No ifs and or buts something is wrong. They tell me that although my Doctor has delivered preemies before

When they admit me to Abbot is when I begin to understand that something is really wrong. You know how when you check in to a Hospital you spend an hour filling out paperwork? 
     When we arrive they put me in a wheelchair and rush me to a room. I am in the ICU. They hook me up to an IV
But although my Baby is in distress we don't know what is wrong with her and we don't know why she is so small. 

I remember when the phlebotomist came in to put in the IV. She had a cart full of test tubes. I asked her if she was doing blood draws for the whole floor. She told me ""No

 Over all it takes 2 days in the ICU before we have a diagnosis. preeclampsia AKA pregnancy high blood pressure. My normal blood pressure at the time was 80 over 60 or so

I get hormone shots to speed up the lung development of the baby. I get my blood drawn twice a day to check on my liver and kidneys.

  After all most 2 weeks of this I wake up at 4 in the morning and my chest hurts. It is like an elephant is sitting on me. I am having trouble breathing and it HURTS. I ring for the nurse. She pages my Doctor. They wheel in an ex ray machine and take a film of my chest. My heart monitor is going off and I black out. I wake up a few minutes later and my chest still hurts and I am being wheeled into the operating room. 

We have tried to reach ""Dad"" to no avail. My friend who has stayed with me in the hospital since I called her 2 weeks ago is wearing scrubs. I am told that I can't feel anything below my chest because they had put in a spinal block. (which is a relief

In the operating room they put up a drape below my chest. In just a few minutes I hear her cry and the doctor says ""I can't believe this little peanut is breathing on her own."" They clean her up press her briefly to my face and put her in an isollet. My Friend runs down the hall next to my Daughter and her Doctor and Nurse. They are bringing her to Children's Hospital. It is really just down the elevator and across the hall. I get told she is 1 lb 15oz and 13 inches long. 

I am in the OR while they clean me up and staple me closed. My Mom watched as they brought bag after bag of blood soaked gauze out of the room. In recovery they tell me to sleep. I won't. 

After 2 hours in recovery They wheel my bed to the elevator, I would have started to have seizures and I would have died. If I hadn't been canning...

The apple sauce was delicious.

I filter the sap with coffee filters in a strainer as I poor it into these two 6qt pans.  Probably not strictly necessary

I try to ditch the stainless pan early on and combine it all into the cast iron dutch oven because the cast heats so much more evenly.  You get a lot less sugar in the syrup that way.

Now I let it sit at steam away a bit more moisture with the burner off.  Then I pour it into one of 2 large measuring cups I have so it can settle. 

[1qt cup](http://i.imgur.com/xpxT4Ck.jpg)

After it's settled I poor the top 90-some-percent of it off into jars or dispensers and toss the sugar and ugly bits at the bottom of the measuring cups.

I've noticed many people posting their canned tomato products and think that is great. When it comes to preserving my tomato crop I find dehydrating and storing them in sterilized quart jars is the most efficient for my time and space constraints.
A couple years ago I bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVJ3C/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00) dehydrator and have been really really pleased with its performance

For tomato sauce I will slice up my tomatoes into chunks up to 1/2"" thick, then run them through a food processor to grind them into powder. A 3 gallon load of tomatoes will condense down to about a half pint to a pint once powdered. For reconstituting into sauce a 1 part tomato to 4 parts water volume ratio is recommended, but I tend to like my sauce a bit thicker, so I usually do a 1:3.5. You could also add your other dried herbs to the powder, in fact it is somewhat recommended as they will keep your powder free flowing longer. Some of my powder at two years old has seized up a bit and must be broken loose, but I have been in and out of the jar a couple dozen times.

For recipes that call for tomato chunks just forgo the powdering step and throw a little extra water in the recipe

 You will need:

2 heaping cups of fresh dandelion petals  (see note below-you'll need to gather about 4 cups whole flowers)

2 C boiling water

1/4 C well-strained clear lemon juice

4 C sugar

3 oz liquid pectin (Certo)

food coloring (optional)

NOTE:  Look for fully opened flowers

We'll want just the dandelion petals for this - not the whole flower head.  You'll get SOME green sepals

Pour boiling water over petals and let steep from 30 minutes to 24 hours.  About 2 hours will produce a good infusion.  Liquid should be room temperature.  Strain through a fine sieve

Place jars and lids on rack in pan or stockpot deep enough to cover them with about two inches of water, keeping the jars hot until ready to fill.

To make the jelly

The natural color will be a golden hue.

Ladle quickly into jars within about 1/8 inch from the top; clean each rim and threads of the jar as it's filled

Sealed jars will last up to one year in a cool

Partly I deserved it because I thought myself so smart as to take on two different jams at the same time. The processing times were the same and the cooking process was the same, but on a trip to the farmer's market I just couldn't pass up the very tail end of strawberry season...

I made the berry jam recipe, no pectin recipes, out of the Ball Blue Book (I ruined that book, I'm not sure the pages will turn anymore...). I halved the berry recipe into 4.5 cups of crushed berries and 3 cups of sugar. I also halved the jar size, yield was originally 3 pints (on the full recipe), and I wanted half pints, so I planned for 3 half-pints. I did NOT alter the strawberry recipe, but halving is OK. 

As I was crushing the blueberries I sensed *something* was amiss... just looking at the berries and looking at the 3 half pints I knew it wasn't going to fit. So I actually washed and sterilized 4 half pints

Everything was fine until I tried to bring them to a boil... they both sat there and did nothing for the longest time, they foamed up and boiled over in the span of like a *minute*. Sticky syrup EVERYWHERE. In my haste to get them off the heat, I made it 10x worse. Under the burners, all over the pot handles, all over me, all over the floor, on the cabinets, actually.

I was able to find a bigger pot for the blueberry mix, quit foaming and started to gel nicely.  The strawberry however... it foamed over at least two more times. It then scorched. It never even pretended to gel, it because slightly less runny but I think it was just because I kept having to pour off the liquid underneath all the floating fruit. 

Since the blueberry was behaving, with WAAAAY too much blueberry stuff. I should add here that I was really meticulous with my measurements, and the blueberries were slightly less than 4.5 cups because I ran out. I used all 4 half pints, and then filled almost an entire pint. The strawberry, had I not spilled it everywhere AND poured a large portion out, would probably have been spot-on 3 pints or close to it.

The good news is everything sealed... even the monsterous blueberry-strawberry rejects/bottom of the pots jar that I wasn't too sure about. But I'm just really curious about what the heck happened here. Why was the blueberry so much more than what the recipe said yield was

BTW, I did not realize just how little I knew about jam until I was knee-deep in it. I know I won't be trying anything jelly-y until I get a fire extinguisher (that was my number one thought when it got all under the burners!!) but if this kind of stuff is par for the course I may just stick with my vinegar...",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,

Anyway

The rules would be simple.  Only jam, in your kitchen, with your hands, under your supervision.  Ingredients on the label (if you have food allergies, you may want to sit this out).  You mail 2 jars of your choosing to your jam exchange buddy.  They mail 2 jars back to you.  I'll set a deadline for entry, and then a 2 week window in which to ship your box.

Like I said, sharing out blogs, and then sharing our jam.  Drop a line if you'd be interested.

*****EDIT*****:
Okay

If you are interested in participating send an email to jamexchange@yahoo.com (can you believe it was still available?)  Include your name, as well as whether or not you are willing to ship internationally.  The deadline for entry will be September 25th .  So if you belong to any other subs or blogs where you want to promote this, feel free.  I will match up partners between September 26th and October 1st.  Everyone should box and ship their package between October 1st and October 8th.  Please ship your package by October 8th so your jam buddy is left in the dark.  By October 15th we should all be enjoying our bounty!!

Fancy packing is basically when you take time [to cut](http://i.imgur.com/0oz1R.png) and arrange your foods in a pleasing manner before processing. Olives stuffed with pimentos is a great example. Layering potato slices neatly rather than simply throwing them in the jar is another. For fancy packed peppers you might use a multiple colored mix of spears. Maybe place a jalapeno half inside a red bell pepper quarter. For fruit butters some people make multiple layers of contrasting color and complimentary flavors. Of course this takes more effort and more knowledge about canning. You wouldn't want to screw up the ph of your food just to make it look prettier. 

Most state fair judges ignore fancy packing if not openly prohibit it. Economy packing or simple packing seems to be the preference by far. I suppose it makes sense. Competitions are a way to raise awareness about canning and the judges probably don't want it to seem fussy or time consuming. That's practical but I don't see why there can't be a separate category devoted to fancy packing. It can be fun to come up with pretty

One classic fancy packing technique is for canning pear or apple halves. Cut the center out with a melon baller or round measuring spoon. Cut away the stem area neatly and stuff each opening with a cherry. Place the fruit in a jar with the cherry facing outwards. Alternate with the stem end up and down. Fill the center area of the jar slices and process according to your directions.

Does anyone else have ideas for fancy packs? Is anyone interested in having a fancy pack competition here? If so I would be happy to donate a month of Reddit Gold to the winner.

The tomatoes should start to burst and develop nice charred edges, the onions should be starting to caramelize (if not, bake it longer, or at a higher temp).  Take it out, throw in a handful of fresh basil leaves, about a half dozen smashed cloves of garlic and sprinkle in some crushed red pepper.  Mix it all up again.  Lower the temp to 325.  Bake it for another hour to hour and a half.

Take it out and pour it all in the blender..  Get all the hot liquid in there too.  Blend on high until smooth.  Best fucking gravy ever.  Can it as is,False,self,t5_2re2w,1347564272.0,,,t3_ztuq3

The one tangible thing that has changed from my old place to my new is the elevation.  I'm closer to sea level, but this week on the stove things were worse.

So questions:  

Does processing time matter this much?  If I processed for five minutes longer would that make a difference?

How important is the time it takes to recover a boil in the canner?  This stove seems to take longer..does that matter?  I don't start counting processing time until I reach a boil

Another issue is that I have one of those ""granite"", and even with pints I get a lot of spill over.  As a result, during a processing event, there's over an inch of water above the jars at the start, but there will be moments when it falls to less than an inch.  I check every 2minutes or so.

Also, not sure if that is messing with them.

Finally, but trying to minimize every source of problems here.

Thanks for whatever help you can provide.

Edit:  Once again, especially related to head-space and the age of my lids.  I'll let everyone know if the next round is a bigger success (probably in 2-3 weeks).",,False,self,t5_2re2w,1343686273.0,,

1355814616.0,151ikn,"Shipped canned goods, fingers crossed. ",Vikaroo,19,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/151ikn/shipped_canned_goods_fingers_crossed/

I'm making this a post because I have some good information for anyone who is planning on shipping canned goods as gifts this season, fruits, salsas and such. 

I highly underestimated how many boxes I would need. I ended up with 4 10x10x10 boxes and 4 12X12X9 boxes, plus I crumple-paper-padded the top and bottom of the box, and added some bubble wrap and crumbled paper to the sides. I was feeling pretty good about myself, I packaged them all up so that there was no movement in the boxes, and that I thought I had enough padding all the way around and in between, and pre-printed my shipping labels, threw ""fragile"" on all sides just in case that helps (the internet says it doesn't) and dropped them off at FedEx. 

Then I got the bad news. 
Only when I was dropping off my very last box did the employee say ""they must survive a 5 foot drop because of the conveyer belt"". There was nothing I could do at that point to make myself feel better about it

So here are my tips for anyone in the future. 

1. Buy a larger box (NOT a huge box

2. Buy GOOD bubble wrap, one will mush and the other will stay firm. Also the more expensive stuff stick to itself a little making wrapping easier. 

3. Bubble wrap every single jar individually so that you can feel the squish

4. Cushion the bottoms, then fill any extra space with crumpled newspaper, peanuts, or more bubble wrap. You want to have to squeeze those smaller boxes closed to tape them - there should be NO movement once they are taped if you shake them. If there's movement then cram some more stuff in. 

5. Put the smaller boxes into the bigger box. If the fit is not snug

6. Try not to freak out for the next few days until your packages arrive

Any other suggestions are welcomed. Hopefully my packages arrive

TL;DR:
Packages shipped through FedEx must be able to survive a 5 foot drop on the conveyer belt. This post may help you avoid sadness and loss of delicious canned goods. ",self,t5_2re2w,1355815860.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/151ikn/shipped_canned_goods_fingers_crossed/

1375935255.0,1jxo4y,Some advice on my new canner....,_strngbird,19,4,14,"Hello!

I'm starting my next venture in food and cooking - canning. I bought a Presto 16 - quart canner and since I have zero experience with all this I don't know if the canner I got is defective or not. I'm wondering if any here would lend me a little of their experience.

I emailed Presto support and we had a couple messages back and forth but they haven't answered my question whether this is normal or if my unit has troubles. One reply kind of said it's normal and the other kinda said it isn't. No matter. I made a couple videos of the problem to mail to them and thought I would ask here as well.


The problem is this...

The canner hisses steam all the time from the vent with the weight on it. So far I have tested it only a few times with water but each time the results were the same. It hissed continuously while the pressure raised

I have put the videos on youtube if any are interested in seeing the problem. The first is the pressure rising and the second is at 11lbs for about 10 minutes.

canner 1 - http://youtu.be/voaHGkB_0Hk

Does anyone here have an experienced opinion? Is it normal / ok? Or is it defective? If it is ok

I followed the directions in my All American manual as scrupulously as I could, finger tight lids, very very clean rims with vinegar etc... and I processed them for 100 minutes at 10 lbs of pressure as was outlined in the Bernardin website for canning salmon. I watched the gauge sputter about 2 or 3 times per minute and tried not to fuss with the stove dial too much. I waited the 10 or so minutes after the pressure reached zero before opening the canner.

My question is this: when I opened the canner, and this morning I removed all the rings and checked each one individually to find the leaked one but all of them are sealed with about level contents. Is it normal to find some contents in the canner? It is an oily fish, so I am worried they are not really sealed, if any oil leaked under the seal.... advice? is this normal and I should calm down? should I just watch the jars carefully over the next few weeks?

Hey /r/canning


I had some pretty good luck with my habanero and jalapeno pepper plants this year. I have more peppers than I know what to do with! I have 65 habaneros (and more growing) and probably twice as many jalapenos (I didn't count those). Last year I made one batch of habanero hot sauce and it lasted me through the year until I had fresh ones again. That only used about 10 peppers. I have enough to make at least 5 batches of the stuff
For the jalapenos, so I'd like to find a way to freeze them. (I might be willing to try canning if someone can make it sound easy and botulism-free). What about making chipotles en adobo? Does anyone have experience with that? I have a charcoal grill, but not a smoker. Any other ideas?

The recipe in question is for a spaghetti sauce. It begins with frying some vegetables (including garlic) in vegetable oil in a dutch oven, mushrooms, spices, etc) are added and the sauce is covered and put in the oven for 3 hours at 300F. Then the oven is turned off and sauce is put on the stove to reduce for a bit.

Then all the canning jars are cleaned, this time set for 400F. After the jars have been at 400F for 10 minutes, they're taken out to cool a bit before canning (to avoid thermal shock of the glass). Then I stick the lids into boiling water for a minute and pour the sauce into the jars, wiping down the rims if necessary before putting the lids on. Then I screw the rings on and wait for the lids to pop. That's it.

I've been pickling and preserving for a bit over a year now and I've really great results. This past month my husband I decided to get a pressure canner so we could preserve fish that he gets from his job at the local green market as well as some low acid foods. Our first foray into pressure canning we did tuna

Yesterday I did the NCHP's pressure canner chili and hit a few snags. The first one was simply in the recipe. I followed it to the letter and found my chili to be REALLY dry. Like

I didn't drain my meat because we used very little fat to brown it and it simply didn't have any excess oil to mine or my husband's eyes(we did throw it in a collander for a quick second but it didn't seem to give off any oil). Anyway, and quite a bit of moisture had left the jars. So here are my questions.

1)Should I worry about the lack of liquid in my jars? I mean

2)Any ideas why so many of my jars didn't seal? I thought it might have been oil seeping out of the jars and interfering with the seal

My grandmother has an entire basement full of canning jars of various sizes, so she gave me a bunch of jars a various sizes.

Along with your usual jelly, and quart jars, she also gave me some half gallon and gallon sized jars.  I understand that these jars are not considered safe for canning anything except very acidic juices like grape juice (and I think that might only be for the 1/2 gallon, I'm not sure).  Besides, I don't have a pot large enough to fit these jars, so it is impossible for me to process them at all.

I know that she used these jars for open-kettle canning grape juice.  I'm not sure if she used them for anything else.  I also know that open-kettle canning is generally considered to be unsafe, she doesn't always follow the newer canning guidelines.  She's been canning every year for a very long time, starting when she was helping her mother and sisters can at the age of 6, so I'm not going to correct her.

Does anyone here know of any uses for jars this size?  I know that botulism can't grow in highly acidic environments like a jar of grape juice

Obviously I could just use them for general storage or something like that

http://imgur.com/a/EvSFR For some of the pictures I took along the way.

A local store was running a special $29.80 for a 20 lbs package of frozen chicken (1.49/lbs). We enjoy cooking with canned chicken

Comparable at the grocery store was 3.79 for 3/4 of a lbs in a can

I got a bunch of empty jars when I bought my last house (they were in the attic), or you can sometimes find them for $0.25 on craigslist.  I think you can reuse them indefinitely.  

I like to cut the chicken into about one inch cubes

My pressure cooker can hold 14 quarts so I did it in two batches.  This sale was of chicken breast filets, they cut into more uniform cubes.  Notice one picture of the fat pieces in the corner of the [cutting board,](http://i.imgur.com/vH1dph.jpg) these are the only pieces cut off for the first batch.  You don't want to can fatty things, since I think it can make it so it doesn't seal well.

Our dishwasher is broken

Filled them to a little more than an inch from the top, boiled them while cleaning off the rims, and then put them in the pressure cooker.

The pressure cooker is too big for our glass top stove, since we are more than 1,000 feet above sea level, we set the clock for 90 minutes.  I like to just turn off the burner and let it cool down really slowly, generally I do this late at night, so I just go to bed after I turn off the burner.

After doing 28 quarts I had a couple pounds of cubed chicken left over for dinner the next night.

So I couldn't figure out if they were pickled or fermented but I decided to go with a pickled recipe as I am just getting in to fermenting and have never done a fruit.  I found this recipe and OMG.  I tried one after I packed them and even the unpickled one covered in the brine/syrup is amazing.  I did a gallon (ok 7 pints after we ate  some of the blackberries) today and I am going to do another 3 in the morning.

I will note that the recipe says it should make 12 jars (.5 cup jars) but when I've followed it I easily get 16-17 of those jars.

To summarize the steps I take:

* mush berries into 4 cups of juice
* put juice in pot
* boil jars / lids 
* add package of pectin ([this stuff] (http://www.frugallivingnw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sure-jell-pectin1.jpg)) and 1/3 cup sugar to juice and disolve
* turn to High heat until it boils
* add remaining sugar (about 4 cups) and stir until disolved
* return to boil and allow to boil for 1 minute
* remove from heat
* take out jars and fill w/ jelly
* let cool 24 hours.

I was left with a 50% success rate on jars that sealed and those that didn't. Our recipe was 2 parts pear, the gel stage. It took over 3 hours.  My questions are



1) We didn't use Pectin. We boiled it down until the temperature reached 120F as recommended by the Ball Book. This morning the the jam looked semi-loose



2) We boiled the jars for 10 minutes - BUT - they came down to room temp before we had the chance to fill them. Is this why half our jars didn't seal? We did put the unsealed jars in the fridge this morning. Should I be concerned with safety since the jars had cooled by the time we filled them?


3) We didn't boil the filled jars as recommended by the Ball book. My wife's parents say they've been canning for ""100 years"" and never once boiled the jars after filling. How safe is this with high sugar jams?


4) As for a big pot to process your jars. Are you better off with a relatively cheaper (~$50) thin metal pot made for canning or a more expensive heavy duty general purpose stock pot? One that may have a thick disk bottom or tri-plan design?



****EDIT- I tried the jam when I got home from work today with a slice of toasted homemade French oven bread. This is hands down the best jam I've ever tasted!

First

From left to right

1. Peach Basil Jalapeño
 - The basil really brings a good savory flavor to this
1. Blueberry Peach
 - Good flavor combo
1. Peach Ginger
 - Ginger goes really well with peach.  Man oh man.
1. Strawberry Blueberry
 - I thought this would just be like any other jam
1. Strawberry Balsamic Black Pepper
 - My wife an I have no words for how good this is.  It is fairly well known that balsamic vinegar brings out a lot of the flavor in strawberries, but it is amazing.
1. Blueberry Ginger
 - Ginger seems to kind of bring out the flavor of blueberry the way that balsamic brings out the flavor of strawberry.  We did run out of fresh ginger by the time we got to this
1. Strawberry Jalapeño
 - Love the heat that the jalapeño adds.  I deseed them before chopping and adding to the mix.
1. Strawberry Balsamic (behind the Strawberry Jalapeño)
 - Good combo
1. Blueberry Jalapeño
 - Same as my comment for the Strawberry Jalapeño.

For recipes, and reduced the amount of fruit accordingly.  When balsamic vinegar was used, it replaced most of the lemon juice.  The ginger and basil didn't add enough volume for us to really care.

The only snag I really hit was that some of my Peach Basil Jalapeño and Peach Ginger jams didn't set.  To my credit

I also took this opportunity to play around with putting butter into my mix to reduce foaming.  I've always shied away from the idea because the notion of putting butter into my jam seems weird, there was a huge difference.  Let me show you:  [With and without butter](http://imgur.com/VUyhk).  The strawberry balsamic on the left, made with a small pat of butter, has little to no bubbling and looks far clearer than the same recipe on the right without butter.

Here is the link to the sauce - it's pretty good! After reading reviews I halfed the mustard and cumin and added white onion and garlic.

I haven't been canning very long but I am enthusiastic and have a quick question for all you veterans.

I am in the process of making long fermented kosher dill pickles. I put my pickles in with the brine about 7 days ago. From what I understood, though, it doesn't seem like it'll ever start fermenting and now I am considering alternatives to salvage these cucumbers. Can I compensate by adding more vinegar to can and process them through a water bath as usual? Are these cucumbers just not destined to be pickles?

Any information you guys could give me would be appreciated. I would rather not throw out perfectly good cucumbers and if I can work my way to another solution I'd much rather that.

* They would not know what to do with a mason jar if they ever saw one.

* Preservation methods are typically natural preservatives (salt, alcohol, activating the enzymes of the foodstuff...).

* The weird things are their canning methods: Boil some fruit with sugar (typically much less sweet than an American jam), put on shelf, consume over the course of a year. Boil the fruit to a syrup, put through a sieve into a bottle, screw on cap, reconstitute a tablespoon in a glass of water as a beverage, lasts for years. Take some raw fish and/or vegetables, vinegar and a pinch of sugar, will keep for months while eating from it until eaten up. And so on and so on...

The GF made some rapsberry-blueberry jam this weekend and used pectin to make it hold together. Problem is, and all we can find on the internet is ""use it to bake cakes !"". She did 12 can of it, that's a whole lot of cake ;).

I looked pectin up on wikipedia, or will it evaporate the water and make a pectin-sugar cement ? And if it does turn back to liquid (by adding water in the heating process to help), will it cool back to jam after the second cooling, or would we have to add back more pectin ?

The pectin I picked out, or if I should use Pomona low sugar pectin instead. The recipe is vague about what kind of pectin is required. I'm assuming it is meant to be a soft set but would like any advice you guys have. 

Thanks.  

[PINEAPPLE HABANERO JAM](http://www.food.com/recipe/pineapple-habanero-jelly-441782#ixzz1ncUO5xb4)

* 15 habaneros
* 1 orange bell pepper (or a bell pepper the same color as the habs)
* 4 cups cubed pineapple
* 1 cup vinegar
* 5 cups sugar
* Pectin
* pinch of salt

Directions:

 In Blender or Food Processor combine Habaneros, chop fine.

Bring to a boil on Medium/High heat
 
Add Fruit Pectin

Add Sugar
 
Return to a boil and hard boil for 2 minutes

 Remove from Heat and Skim Foam.
 
 Ladle into sterilized 4oz Jars leaving 1/8"" head space.

 Seal and process in boiling water bath for 5 minutes.

 I typically yield 12-14 of the 4 oz jars. May take 1 to 2 days for the jelly to set.

**edit:** Thanks for the response everyone. I went ahead and followed solarmama's advice that if they didn't specify low sugar pectin to use the Sure Jell. I don't know if the stuff will set hard because I increased the vinegar by 1/2 cup. I wanted to be safe because the red pepper I used was pretty large and I wanted to add a garlic clove. I know

I kept the seeds and stems from 4 of the peppers as well. From tasting a bit of the jelly that was left over the heat is pleasantly intense but short lived. I think next time I will only keep the seeds/veins from 2 though. I really recommend this if you like pepper jellies. It's very fruity and the color is just beautiful thanks to the red pepper. The texture right now is sort of like apple butter so I'm hoping it will set up ok

First the bottom of pot was burnt black and has been a pain to clean up. This is interesting because it lends a caramelized flavor to the jam which isn't bad just different. I could feel it burning the bottom when stirring before I added the bulk of the sugar.

Second after adding the bulk of the sugar the jam essentially boiled over which led to lots of foam and a mess in the sink.
