I am a deaf dude! Playing dust without being able to communicate is a horrible idea

Is there a certain build or game plan that anyone can think of that might be more forgiving for my situation? 

I assume I won't be of much use in a team and won't be able to get involved with the corporation side of the game

Does anyone else play with any success without voice communication?

That being said, a stamina module, a hacking module, a bit of shields, and an SMG. I didn't really think it would work that well, considering how poorly I'd been doing up to that point, but I emerged surprised.

As the skirmish started I ran up to every hackable thing I could and captured it, and proceeded to capture the surrounding support structures. Moving toward the second cannon I saw an HMG-wielding heavy. I pinged him a few times and ran away, letting him follow me. Once he was deep enough into close quarters I ran away, heading toward the cannon I'd been trying to take the whole time. A few moments go by and I see one of my teammates has killed him, nice. I then head in and capture the second cannon, putting my team in the lead 2-to-1.

A bit of downtime goes by, versus having to run what I assumed was practically a mile from our initial spawn point. Somehow we fight off the red wave and it's just me and another fellow who just happened to be watching these two enemies walking towards us. My team mate draws their attention and I sneak over to a point where they won't see me until they enter the room we're in. As the first one enters, his shields are already stripped thanks to my teammate and it only takes a second for my SMG to finish him off. The second one proves to be a bit more annoying and takes cover. But through some unspoken order, my teammate and I flank him on both sides, trapping him and cutting off any escape he might have had. We close in and start filling him with holes, but he's a little tougher than the first one. Just as we're about to kill him he gets taken out by a friendly sniper who'd just happened to be watching the entire ordeal not too far away.

As the match ends, and low and behold my WP are the highest I've ever had them. I had 955 points with a 7/4 k/d, almost double my previous best, and this while using a suit I've never used before.

I decided to drop a few hundred aurum and the minimum amount of SP for some codewish tactical rifles to really see how they handle

I went into a FW fight, not the TARs, would be confirmed.

[**I was completely incorrect.**](http://i.imgur.com/xQxpN4g.jpg)

Every single enemy that i saw, a large portion of these kills were on proto logistics and assaults.

I died occasionally when i was outnumbered or just playing badly, this is now a complete CQC fight, the TAR cannot possibly stand up to enemies at these ranges""

**I was completely incorrect.**

The TAR has little to zero spread when firing

From my capture point the TAR could just hit people hacking another capture point

Not only could I destroy people trying to take my capture point, enemies hacking another capture point.

TL;DR: with only AR operation 3 and a full militia fit

Even with my experience with EVE I did still find the whole Skills + Market place a little confusing as to learning what is effective or not and which weapons may be better over others.  All the tools both in and out of EVE make things easier to plan although I presume similar tools could be made for Dust

The game play itself was fully enjoyable although I'm finding myself with horrible K/D Ratio's so far

1375365548.0,1jhsj2,FOTM Fools and How Newbs Should Fit Suits,bladesire,35,7,21,"So I'm noticing this trend amongst some players to skill into the most OP setup they can find

I think that in a game like DUST, is ostensibly there forever, playing into such ""Flavor of the Month"" fits is just a really bad idea.  Sure, if you've got 15mil SP and can use all those fits anyway, switching between them worrying only about ISK expense, then do whatever the fuck you like - but don't go around encouraging the newbros to spec this way or that way.  Why?

To put it simply

* Caldari Logistics used as Assault suits
* Laser Rifle
* Tactical Assault Rifle
* Flaylock Pistol

While none of these is individually a BAD choice to spec into, hey, this is the best fit you can get right now, so as a newb you'll do best if you can get into it, but the reality is, that nerf hammer is JUST around the corner and you may have just sent a would be friendly newb into a massive disappointment.

I don't believe DUST is a game where people should spec for power; instead

---

**What do you want to do?**  

* Do you want to be a sneaky assassin

* Or maybe you want to be the logibro

* Or perhaps that minmatar logi suit is your go-to Point Hacker

* Or maybe that Commando suit looks like the perfect AV choice - a plasma cannon AND an AR does seem like it'd be a fun playstyle.

* Or how about an assisting scout

---

DUST isn't about playing towards the Flavor of the Month


CCP updates their games, just like the nerf hammer is destined for FOTM, so is the buff hammer headed for the Gimp of the Month.


**TL;DR - Don't listen to fools telling you that this fit or that fit is the ""way to go"" with regards to skills.  If you're telling people to go for powerful weapons


EDIT: Format

EDIT 2:  u/irememberurface made a good point - be sure to check out the **Militia tab in the market** to gain access to the **no-requirement items**.

1363147164.0,1a7251,What I Have Learned Sniping in Dust.,Mike_The_Moose,33,6,27," General.

1. Have an alternate role. Sniping doesn't always work out, or your team just needs you someplace else. Have at least one go to backup backup role that you can fill so-so at least.

2. You will run out of ammo. Get a fit with at least a compact nanohive as soon as you can. Coming out of position and all the way to a supply station then back into position hurts your effectiveness. For God's sake

3. Be prepared to switch priorities and position. Combat is a fluid situation. Even if you have a sweet spot

4. The closer you are the faster you can deliver a hit. Seems like a no brainer

5. Crouch. You'll live longer

6. Cover is nice but concealment is what you need. Cover will keep assault goons from ventilating you...for a second. Concealment is what keeps you from getting counter-sniped. 

7. It normally takes one head shot or two body shots to kill a target. We'll discuss when body-shots are a good idea later.

8. Your scout dropsuit offers very little protection

Skirmish:

First Rule. You are part of a team. Your objectives are to take the Null Cannons. NOT Kill enemy toons. Your assault team will be doing the heavy lifting. You exist to serve their needs. Your role falls broadly into one of three areas.

1. Direct support fire. This means you fire on the enemy while they are engaged on your assault team. Body hits are OK. You are trying to make it hard for them to know when they are engaged and disengaged, as well as weaken their armor/shields so they are easier for the assault team to kill.  Your priority of targets are 

Enemy Snipers. They will drop your guys and pin them down. Make them dead. 
Heavy Infantry (Try and shoot these guys in the head) They spearhead assaults. Killing them slows enemy advance.
Everyone else. 

There will be a lot of shooting going on if you are behind your guys

2. Area control. Find a spot that allows you to control key areas and deny access to single targets. By key I mean null cannons. By areas I mean at least two of them unless you get one of those 3 null cannon levels. Don't let the enemy reclaim the null cannons you cover. 

3. You've got the scout suit which means you can move pretty much without showing up on enemy radar. Which means if you get an opportunity on an exposed enemy null cannon

Remember. Team

Ambush:
First Rule. You are part of a team. The goal here is to kill more enemy toons than the enemy kills your guys. You need to deliver with the killshots. 

Basic principals: 

Try not to get into a direct support role right behind your guys. It will make you dead more often.
Dead toons are worth a point
If you spot or encounter an enemy sniper
Remember your goal is to pile up the bodies without dying. Your spot selection should reflect this. If you can't find a spot that racks up kills, time to explore that alternate role again. 

Sniping is a dynamic thinking role, and your team and the battle as it unfolds. If you think it is just about sitting back in the hills and shooting convenient targets you are doing it wrong. ",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,1363208836.0,minmatar,

However, where the skill finally unlocks a new tier of items.

The *Dropsuit Core Upgrades* for equipment items also have this problem. Ranks 2 and 4 are just buffers between you and the next tier of equipment

Skills like *Armor Repair Systems* don't have this problem. ""Unlocks access to armor repairer dropsuit modules. +5% to armor repair module efficacy per level."" Yes

Im creating a new topic on it specifically to bring it out in the open
http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/17gi1g/heavy_machine_gun_has_no_spool_up_time/c85ne5b

Heavies have a few exploitable weaknesses but first you have to know their strengths.  They have lots of health and access to the heavy weapon slot.

The health lets them stay around in a fight a lot longer but can also be a major downfall.  Heavies get cocky

Second, and will shred infantry out in the open without breaking a sweat.

**Range**     
Stats you need to know:     
Assault Rifle     
Max Range: 78m     
Optimal Range: 1 - 35m     

Heavy Machine Gun      
Max Range: 59m     
Optimal Range: 1 - 34m     
Meta Level: 1      

Now

You need to know this

**Cover**      
Now that the above  isnt always an option.  the next best thing is cover.  You guys with the AR's may not notice this much

That circle the heavy has, stand behind a barricade.  Do ANYTHING besides let us see your whole body.  Iv been killed countless times by a guy wielding an AR trading hits with me simply because half my shots or more hit the cover instead of him.

**War of Attrition**     
We have lots of health.  But the MK1 heavies a lot of people still use armour tank with 700-800 HP.   their shields only have 100 HP

A common tactic people use to bring down heavies is to pop out and take out their shields and a bit of armour

This has two effects.  The heavies armour will slowly get lower and lower making them panic

Its a slow process

**Grenades**       
Remember that comment of heavies running as fast as you walk?  Grenades are hell for them.

**Scout suits+shotties**
Heavies have a poor turn speed, sneak around us, get into our blind spot and punish us.   Its rock paper scissors.  Scouts are the bane of heavies, heavies are the bane of AR/assault suits, and it sounds as if AR/assault have little problem handling the Scouts.   If a scout gets to a heavy (which isnt very hard) the fight is basically over right there.

**Speed**     
within a range 0-15 or 0-20 meters you are dead if a heavy gets a bead on you.  But we cant turn very fast, dont stop moving, if you are in a heavies kill zone get out of the kill zone.  At that range an assault suit can run fast enough that the heavy will have a lot of trouble keeping a bead on you.  You might not kill the heavy if you have to run like this, but its better than giving him a free kill.

**Spool up**     
We get more accurate as we keep firing

This is deadly for you.  How do you avoid it?  Dont give us a target long enough.  This was mentioned in the war of attrition but it deserves its own point.  If we keep firing when we cant see you we retain accuracy but waste ammo and risk overheating.  If we stop firing then we are less accurate when you pop back out.  Just dont pop out for long.

**Snipers:**     
Snipers in a 1v1 scenario have the advantage of range over everyone.  However without support unless the heavy is stuck completely out in the open or has to cross a large stretch of land snipers should look for other targets unless they have a friend or ally nearby who can take advantage of a temporarily wounded heavy.

The Mark I Heavy suit can soak a snipers shot with their shields without really caring.

The Mark II Heavy Suit takes 2 shots to drop their shields, draws their focus, and possibly wastes ammo if they dont have a nano-hive.

Given a Mark I suit cant do that as well (100 vs 300 shield), id find a better target than a full health Heavy.  (my second favorite fitting is a sniper fit)

**Conclusion:** This is for solo use, but that takes time too, its hard to control, and they are easy to kill unless your entire team is completely ignoring anti-tank (even a meta 1 HMG will shred a standard LAV)).  Abuse the heavies weaknesses, and for the love of god dont let them play their strengths.

If anyone has any other advice or additions I would welcome them!  (I would also personally welcome advice as a heavy on how to deal with scouts/shotties)  How do you deal with a Heavy? as a Heavy what tends to kill you or get you killed?

**Editors Note:** Iv killed Heavies (or escaped them) in the ways mentioned using non heavy suits as well have been on the receiving end of them when I run Heavy.  I primarily use Heavy suits and that is where my skills are tied up
**Note::** Someone else made another topic similar to this but with a less specific point as I was re-posting this one.  Im sorry I didnt see It before I posted
**Note 2::**Link to the version on the Dust514 forums.

The starter suits not very powerful at all. In fact
The very first match, be it a Medic or Assault class, or both. The controls are not what I would expect on a PS3 controller either, so no matter what weapon I chose, I couldn't hit a damn thing, and when I did, It did diddly squat.
The game

So, acquired non Militia modules and fine tuned the sensitivity on the aiming.

That's better. I decided that Skirmishes were far too large of a map, fast respawn, instant action. Great! I'm learning now. I'm getting better, I'm getting at least 5-6 kill streaks now that I know not to use ADS too much.

1375811291.0,1jtp4m,Newbro to Newpro: Demystifying the Newbie Experience,bladesire,25,1,19,"So, install, you're prepared for the advice herein.  

Lots of people have issues with pubby matches - if you've been on this subreddit for even just a little while, and you think to yourself, ""Well, fuck.  I might as well just shut the game off until I've caught up.""

I'm here to stop you from getting to that point.  There are a few things to understand about DUST before we proceed:


* DUST is for the patient.  You can play as much as you like

* DUST is constantly changing.  As an MMOFPS, and a couple expansions per year to boot.  The game you play now will be different from the one you play in the future, even if only a month into that future.  If you like one weapon, one suit, one fitting setup, be prepared for it to be altered by an upcoming patch - it's not guaranteed for every item, but you can rest assured that anything that seems too good to be true probably is and will be nerfed.  

* DUST is complicated.  The skill and fitting system in DUST does not lend itself to being easily comprehended - though the basics are simple enough


When you come online

---

Before you do ANYTHING

1)  SP are plentiful

2)  Use Militia versions of items.  Some items still don't have these versions

3)  If a fit doesn't work too well, not intended to be out in the open for long periods, but instead ducking behind cover consistently to recharge).

4)  The Assault Rifle is universal - if you're having a bad time with your current fit, is an easy role to fall back on.  Skill into the Assault Rifle as soon as possible, and put a decent amount of SP in it - it will provide you the wiggle room to experiment without gimping you in every match you play.

5)  **THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE I COULD EVER GIVE ANYONE**:  Be a social butterfly.  Get a mic, and generally amicable, not to mention the only way you really get to see someone's whole fit is if they tell you.  Talking with other players will give you a feel for what fits work best when, and why they work like they do.  If you're not an asshole you'll get channel invites and possible corp opportunities.  If you game with the same people over and over, you're likely to develop a rhythm, and DUST, like EVE



---

If you keep these things in mind, but I do think they'll help prevent you from falling into the trap that so many new players do, causing them to rage and bounce.  These tips will make you into the NewPro you were meant to be - still under-skilled and under-informed, but with the foundation to begin making the best of this great shooter.

In closing, I think, and it will not be for everyone.

**TL;DR - Don't spend your SP too soon, spec AR at least a little, join squads and make e-friends.**

Squad Orders

* Attack: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.
* Defend: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.
* Capture: 20% Bonus to War Point gain within proximity of order.

* Whenever I am squadleader

Values listed are gained by Squad Members preforming actions withing the radius of the order.
The Squad Leader gains bonus War Points equal to the bonuses earned by the squad.


Issuing Orders (As Squad Leader) Method 1:

* R2: Opens weapon swap wheel
* R3 (while in weapon swap): Opens squad order selection wheel
* R1: To assign selected order to current target


Method 2:

* Down Directional Pad: Opens Overview Map



Precision Strike:

* Right Directional Pad: Opens a context menu
Middle Menu option: Opens PS selection menu.
X opens overview map to select target.

* Switching suits at supply depots is a golden tactic when used right. The value of a supply depot to me is way higher than it was to begin with alright. The naming is also really helpful as of to create priorities among the suits.

* I have been experimenting with Demolitions II as it gives access to proximity mines and I've already killed a few tanks using em. Whenever I am near a supply depot I always pick my proximity class and place out 6 mines then switch back. My ""anti vehicle"" fitting is now a logibro fitted with proximity mines

* And when using the Swarm Launcher after getting a lock...fire straight up in the air instead of forward and you might get the rockets to pass over a hill

* If you have nothing to do with your strike

* Restock your nanohives every time that you are near a supply depot. All that you have to do is select the same suit that you are in. You don't have to switch to another suit and then switch again. You can just select the same suit that you are in and everything will be replenished.

* Hacked Supply Depots will repair a vehicle's armor (not shields) if you pull up alongside it. Maybe now all you guys will stop destroying them.

* You can play your own music. During the game press the PS button and go to your music files

* Move back and fourth and strafe when capping.

* Another thing about the supply depot is if you switch between two completely different suits (say logi &amp; heavy or even type 1 &amp; 2 of the same class) it'll give you full health.

1372470352.0,1hacvz,My thoughts on the DUST 514 Patch notes and the future of DUST,coolguy696969,25,7,8,"I was one of the naysayers of DUST 514 and I truly believed that the game wouldn't be able to compete with other games because it is simply too broken to do so.

Now my thoughts have changed. Most huge issues that I thought needed to be immediately addressed, fixing latency and stability issues along with finally repairing the broken vehicle physics.

These are just a few off of the top of my head, this will be a truly great game. The biggest issues are the balance, I love the way the game plays and I like the fact that it involves time investment and skill. If this game continues to add depth and variety (I'm sure everyone saw the models for all the new racial fits and weapons that they're adding in so we don't have the same damn weapon model with different stats or colors) it will be a game very similar to EVE in terms of depth on a FPS level.

What are the common expectations for the game at this point? It was awful at beta, all this game needs is more depth and CCP has seemed to really respond to our complaints with this patch. If this game can utilize and further the connection with EVE (easier communication between the two, more depth in alliances and even more content with planetary conquest) I'm thinking this game could be really good.

If this game survives, it's just wasted potential. I surprisingly have more faith in CCP than I originally did.

What you should know ahead of time is that there's many EVE pilots with the ""PC master race"" mentality--that's even part of the established lore

Dust mercs need a dose of the backstory to bring you into our fold, and why you should feel inclined to fight--that there's more compelling reasons than more isk and more stuff.

There's the volumes of [short stories](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/short-stories/) and entries called [Chronicles](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/), which touches on Dust514), and [*The Burning Life*](http://www.amazon.com/EVE-Burning-Life-Hjalti-Danielsson/dp/B004P5OQ4C) (a standalone by a different author). I'm having a splendid time reading these on the slower days of floating in wormhole space. 

That's the exciting thing about DUST514--it's a different lens to experience the same universe of interstellar empires, Curatores Veritatis, etc., as I don't know a good comprehensive source.

Even getting *one* of you to dive further into the universe is a victory for me. 

TL;DR: EVE player writes wall of text asking DUST players to learn about the lore of the game universe

Edit: fixed links

Addendum: Obviously my intended tone is not coming through. I am here to be nice. I am telling you that other people are not always so nice, but I'd rather like the people on the ground with whom I'm going to have to share. ",,False,self,t5_2sh6s,1365561610.0,amarr,

1376899943.0,1knm8g,Look a really fucking long post on Shield Tanking getting buffed by Armor Buffs!,abominare,19,2,21,"In 1.4 CCP has announced that among many things there will be a buff to armor plates. As an exclusively shield tanking player



**Why?**

Because it means I’m getting an amazing free 44 hitpoints and I’ll move faster. Hoorah for buffing Caldari Assault. 



**I Thought This Was an Armor Buff?**

Indeed armor may be less bad



**Theres all sorts of cool things to put into lows though!**

No
Lets make a Proto Caldari Assault Fit
First, the only thing we’re going to be missing assault rifle fitting past 1.

I have four highslots



4x Complex Shield Extenders!


**Wait! What about Damage Mods? Those are totally cool!**

Off the top of your head sure, here lets do some MATH!
Our suit will eventually have 582 Shields and 293 Armor. For ease a basic assault rifle with no skills does 425 normal DPS. When we figure out the damage +- to shields and armor this gives us a time to kill of 1.245+.766= 2.011 seconds. Neat.


Now imagine a fire fight where two guys fit exactly the same except one drops an extender for a complex damage mod


Our fully tanked character will now die in 1.132+.696= 1.828. 
Unfortunately Mr Damage Mod has less HP. 80 HP in fact. Hes dead in 1.074+.766= 1.84 Seconds. 


While at first glance it might look like we’ve narrowly won with a damage mod, the 23rd shot.
In this case we have a net gain of survivability of zero


So I’m going with extenders, and mass drivers I’ll live a hell of a lot longer. Since they’re penalized against shields.


 **Ok whatever

Now lets fill out the rest of the stuff we want. We a Duvolle AR because we aren’t creative
Unless I’m in a PC match I generally have hives, its what I use. PC its obviously uplinks. 


Uh Oh fitting is super tight already. Lets stick a core flaylock on because honestly we don’t have a choice.


Current Fittings CPU: 393/394 and PG 77/79
Well that escalated fast


I’m not aware of any  modules that only use .33 CPU


**You should drop that stupid expensive Nano-Hive!**

I could


1. Armor Reps, the hive is faster, reps other people (yay free triage points)


2. Shield Regulators? Nah


3. Stamina and run speed mods! These things are fucking expensive, or even still slower than me just calling in a lav. If im fighting someone I need to be shooting, you know what you cant do when sprinting? Shoot. You know how you can ensure your self to die in a firefight? Not shooting. I don’t have a shot gun or a nova knife, I don’t need to get that much closer. 


4. Sensor mods, and more like to see the guy who is already being seen by you.


5.All that leaves is fitting mods and armor plates. So by giving up nothing I currently have fitted I could stick on a cpu mod and two basic plates (with ar fitting maxed you can swap these back to ferroplates later for no movement penalty) this will net me ~143 Extra Hp at the cost of  6% movement speed (a little less because penalties have stacking issues). That’s a little ouch But that is still an extra 4 AR shots


Basically the problem is


Eve doesn’t have this problem, or B. Armor which will make me last longer in a fire fight.


Its pretty fucking obvious what you should be choosing.


**So Nerf Shields?**

No, (after patch at most levels we’re getting a 4th of armor’s hp on shield mods), its that shield tanking is actually multitanking. We don’t have any options but to do so.

If you are you can greatly help out yourself as well as all others in your squad by issuing squad orders.

Assuming you are a squad leader if you hit down on the ps3's D-pad this brings up a map of the battle with a cursor/cross hair you can move around the place. If you place this cursor over an objective (for example a null cannon in the skirmish game type) and hold down the 'X' button a few icons will appear around it. While still holding down 'X' you can use the analogue sticks to highlight one of these options such as Capture

If any squad mate should carry out an order given by you as the leader they will get extra WP and you get a  'Squad Leader commission' which also earns you war points

Admittedly this is much easier to do when playing in a squad of corp buddies or other people you know as you will naturally work better together

In my experience

1)  Not using Drop Uplinks

2)  Not reviving fallen teammates in favor of chasing the firefight.


I've got a few suits that are oriented at behind-enemy-lines operation, it seems like 9/10 times, people prefer the worst spawn point.  Either they want to respawn at the surrounded CRU or all the way back at the MCC, or worse, at the Ambush default spawn.  Is there some reason I'm just not seeing for why people would NOT take advantage of a deployed drop uplink?  You're giving your own team WPs, which could in turn lead to a precision strike.  Why aren't you doing this, random pubby DUST players!

Additionally, when eventually, I die.  My forces, I guess swept up in the movement of the firefight, abandon me there, chasing a kill.  While I suppose that a kill and assist is worth more (75 or 90 with orders, iirc), and enables further assists

3 Day Boost = 350 AUR approx $0.47 a day using 3 day boosts
7 Day Boost = 700 AUR approx $0.40 a day using 7 day boosts

As you can see it's only slightly cheaper then a normal 14.99 per 30/d subscription starting at 3 days (approx $0.50/d for 14.99/30d subscription) while being $0.30 more expensive per day using the 1 day boosts.

I do see that they are advertising 4

3 Day Boost = 350 AUR approx $0.58 a day using 3 day boosts

Is the Heavy II dropsuit better than the Heavy I dropsuit?  Is it worth the upgrade.

As it stands checking the side by side values the differences are as follows:     
* The Heavy II is more expensive by 4000 isk/suit.     
* The Heavy II can run 8% (ish) faster for 2.6 seconds longer.     
* The Heavy I has 750 stock Health.    
* The Heavy II has 742 stock health between two modes of tanking.     
* The Heavy II has better shield recharge rates.     
* The Heavy I can be ran without needing to invest in shield upgrades to get the most bang for your buck out of its 'tank'.

**Scout LAV**


The Problem :
You sacrifice one's fitting ability with decreasing PG / CPU on a vehicle type that's already fairly fragile and decide to replace it with a marginal increase in speed. The difference in speed unfortunately is really quit minimal for what you end up having to sacrifice in the ability to fit effective shield / armor modules. 


Defining Their Role :
My suggestion is a fairly simple one, Scout LAV exclusive module that allows them to provide information on the location of enemy units within a certain range in the same way that active scan modules work on vehicles in their current form.

**Logistics LAV**


The Problem :
I touched on it before but right now the problem is that there's little to no reason to go through the trouble of using the Logistics LAV exclusive Dropsuit Repair Module. The camera control is cumbersome, grabbing my repair tool, and manually doing the job instead of having to rely on the LLAV's system.


Minor Problem (Probably easier to address in the short term) :
The Remote Repair module icon looks exactly the same as the repair module one uses to heal one's own armor. I'd like to not be confused as to why my Camera freaks out after trying to rep my own vehicle and realizing that I've picked the wrong module. Unfortunately there's no effective way to really cancel out of this view without activating another module or getting out of the vehicle entirely. Differentiate the icons between armor repair for vehicle and armor repair for dropsuits while inside the LLAV.


The Solution :
The main issue is that you've jerry-rigged the support capability of a Logistics LAV to be analogous to a Repair Tool x Swarm Launcher hybrid when the obvious solution is to make it more like a Nanohive. It's simple

**Overarching Balance Concerns**
I don't want to spend too much time on this but obviously there's an issue with LAVs in the current form of the game. The only suggestions I'd make are as follows :

1. Reduce HP of free Militia Vehicles
Obligatory really

2. Reduce top speed / acceleration of LLAV variant
Encourages their use as support vehicles instead of murder taxis.

3. Add damage taken to Vehicles when running over dropsuits that scales based on amount of HP dropsuit has left.
This serves a lot of purposes I feel :

* It discourages the use of running people over as the primary source of damage for a vehicle
* Encourages having a gunner in the back to
* Helps out the Heavy dropsuits who are the most vulnerable to LAVs in their current form

The equipment slots should be as follows:
Basic Nanohives 
Basic Remote explosives
Basic proximity mines
AV grenades 

For your weapon use a mass driver

General trap:
Set up where you know the LAV is going to drive by like a road through a complex. place your proximity mines and remote explosives on the road. LAV drives by set off you remote explosives switch to your mass driver and put a couple rounds into it but even logistics LAVs will probably die in your mines. Once the LAV is dead drop a given which will. Replenish your proximity and remote explosives then set up again.

1358861609.0,171xtt,"Quick ""not obvious facts"" guide for Dust",RyoxSinfar,14,2,25,"1. Aurum spent is now spent (or we are to assume so). Don't make a purchase you won't stick behind.

2. BPOs (Blueprints) are items not consumed on death. They generally cost Aurum and are for low level items. Other than the armors they aren't too expensive and are great for conserving ISK. *edit(Prices have been adjusted

3. A supply depot installation can be used to swap gear. This is important because if you just swap out of expensive gear you won't lose it. Used something to blow up a tank and now don't need it? Save it.

4. Drop uplinks (spawn points) have limited use

5. You'll find out fast but jump out of the spawn point on the ship and you can not die by pressing X for the ""inertial dampener"". What might not be obvious is this is available anytime

6. LAZZZZZZERS - Lasers can be pretty deadly. What is important to know is they have an ""optimal range"" as in at that point being farther OR closer will reduce damage. If someone is lasering you and they are fairly close

7. Militia items are items that don't require skillpoints to use. They are the lowest level but they are good to try things with or fill in extra slots you don't want to pay for. Militia items have their own space in the marketplace at the bottom of the root list.

8. Voice comms are pay to use only if you want to talk outside the Team and Squad channel. So only if you want to chat in the ""create your own"" channels will it cost you. As a note whatever channel you are talking to remains in effect when you enter/exit a game. So you can talk to your corp while play but talk to people and coordinate.

9. I've never seen anything as devastating in an online game as watching a squad of coordinated and well equipped players roll through my team in Dust. Talk to people and coordinate. Stick together. It matters.

10. Your vehicles aren't safe ever. They are air dropped and vulnerable during this time. They can also be taken by any player on your team as soon as they are deployed.

11. We will not be mad if you overly revive and we die right away. I'm usually just grateful you used it. There are certainly limits to this but we really appreciate someone willing to even pull out the item as it reduces downtime and saves a ticket from being used.

1362012330.0,19d4gu,Current Maximum SP,Tempests_Wrath,14,4,11,"Often I am asked

I wanted to take a crack at answering it.

The first thing we need are some basic numbers.

First.

For closed beta testers the game started on January 10tOpen Beta launched on January 22 (12 days later for those at home)

Non boosted SP rates are:
27200 active/day (Alight fine.. its 190400 a week
24000 passive/day

With an extra 50% for having the booster.

The game has its downtime at 11:30 AM GMT (+0:00)

As of yesterday (Feb 26th) the game was playable in its current iteration for: 47.5 days.  the .5 days matters... technically.  It does ok?  Alright fine.  It matters because of the passive exp.  you can only earn the passive exp for the time the games actually been playable


&gt;For non boosted players who started 'exactly' (or close enough...) at launch on the 22nd your passive SP earned yesterday was: 852

&gt;For boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 22nd your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1

&gt;For non boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 10th your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1

&gt;For boosted players who started 'exactly'  at launch on the 10th your passive SP earned yesterday was: 1


So that is one set of the numbers we need.

Now we do active.  This only matters based on the day you started playing

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your max active SP earned yesterday was: 979

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your max active SP earned yesterday was: 1


So


&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 1

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 2

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3


But wait you might say!  I have more than that right now!! 

Shush.  Professor Wrath isnt done.

Every account starts with a basic 500

In addition everyone who started on the 10th got a 'bonus' 100

And THEN the 'week in a day' SP... thing... that happened could have got you another 163

Adding these values in we get...

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 3

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 4


That was yesterday.

But today it all rolled over.

What does that mean!?

*sigh*

It means that today immediately before the next downtime it would be possible to max out your weekly sp and have 190400+24000 SP unboosted. (full weekly plus 1 day of passive)

So the values for TODAY (Feb 27th) are...

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 2

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 22nd your total SP earned yesterday was: 3

&gt;For non boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 3

&gt;For boosted players who started at launch on the 10th your total SP earned yesterday was: 4



Not counting the extra SP gained from the soft cap... because I have no way to even guess at that.

There you go! those are the max numbers!

.. I think...

(Im pretty sure im the equivalent of a day or two on the low end.. but I cant figure out where I went wrong as i spent too much time writing this up and its currently all a mess of random characters to my brain...)

I have a few ideas:

* Seeker grenades: Like AV Grenades, but we're not balancing it and it could do the damage of a titan's super weapon for all I care.

* Mortar Launcher + Target Painter: A two-man weapon. A target painter shoots a laser at a point and the guy with the mortar launcher locks on and fires the weapon at the point. The mortar launcher fires at an almost vertical tangent, but one should do enough damage to handle the job alone. A major weakness for mortars would be indestructible roofs.

* Jet packs: It's the damn future

* Drones: Sort of like an Engineer's drone in Mass Effect. You deploy a small drone armed with a gun, but a logi drone would be cool too.

* Super weapons: Like a ground-based titan weapon. The weapon could be an orbital drop weapon instead of an actual weapon, but hey.

* Player-erected Cover: Filling in an equipment slot, but let's just say it goes waist high like all cover does. Fun way to block a heavy who can't jump over these walls.

* Intrusion scanner: Jacking this right out of MGS4. Used like an injector on a dead enemy body, giving you an edge in intel and finding those pesky canyon snipers.

* Dropship Stabilizers: Okay

* Invisibility Cloak: Bringing real stealth ninjas into DUST. I'd trade all my shields to become invisible. It'll probably light up your scan profile like a christmas tree, with relevant cooldowns.

* Heavier-than-Heavy dropsuit: Powered Armor? Instead of regular weapon slots

Hello everyone

After seeing constant posts from new players (and even some existing players) about them not understanding the game

For the first video I'm going to explain the differences between each in-game race (Racial bonuses and suits for example) for those who are unfamiliar with the New Eden universe

I hope to make each video as informative and entertaining  as the [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjch0kBjQI]Way of the Mercenary trailer[/url]

Perhaps the story was inspired by FPS sorts of games. But the point was that they ended up with multiple clones running the same consciousness at the same time and the doubles tried to take out their formers.

So I'll just say right off the bat that I don't play DUST 514 (And therefore cannot post on the DUST 514 forums). I will say though that I am an EVE player that has a very keen interest in it. 

With the announcement of Planetary Conquest

I enjoy thinking up new ideas for games

Since DUST Mercs are apparently into the biomass industry (passive production of clones for profit and pleasure [shooting each other])

Not any clones though. New

Why are these new clones coming out planetside labs so special? Well, increase the efficiency and strength of implants installed in the clone. That's one possibility. The other is the potential for clones with extra implant slots. Yup, more slots for more implants crammed into a single body. I think many pilots would think that very relevant to their interests indeed. 

How will you guys make these clones for the Capsuleer market then? Well, it really is up to the devs at this point, be it through random salvage in a specific game mode, harvester modules, or some other wizardry, you will get these materials. 

After collecting some Nano-Biotic Sludge from the depths of some crag on a Plasma Planet or Neuroenhancing Psychoactive Gas from the core of a Gas Giant or something else

Let's make it fun and make some planets yield such materials unequally

Let's make it even more fun, a month or so per body, whereupon a Capsuleer needs to buy a new body in order to sustain their implant bonuses. Don't worry, they don't have to destroy implants, they just have to lop off the head of the previous clone and move the brain to a new body. 

So yeah. Long story short, slather it on a clone to make it get implant bonuses and sell to Capsuleers for the big bucks. 

Just an idea. ",self,t5_2sh6s,1363403685.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dust514/comments/1ae0mt/since_youre_in_the_biomass_market/

I heard that getting in bed with a corporation makes the game much more fun. Unfortunately I have no clue if I'm already in a corporation or if that was just the faction I chose at the beginning? I just wanted everyones help at figuring this game out. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how skills work when it shows SP but then charges me in ISK. Anyways I can honestly see myself loving this game but I need a push in the right direction!

You all seem to enjoy this game and are willing to invest the time to enjoy it as much as possible so I was hoping you kind folks could just give me some advice that you wish you had known when you first began playing.

PS. I have seen a lot of the issues some of you have with the game while skimming through this subreddit and Im okay with them. They're just a small nuisance that I could more easily overlook if I could only figure this game out. 

PPS. I find this to be one of the few games with micro-transactions that does it in a fair way. I usually do well every game

I figured it'd be nice to see what Aurum actually DOES get the players on the ground

When I bought the mercenary pack, and I thought THAT was a great buy (almost all of my 40k AUR).  Well, with my Free-To-Plays (like Tribes) I usually like to toss the developers around the price of a normal game if I like it (50-60), and so I picked up another 40k AUR from the shop and started browsing.  

That's when I realized that the Militia Shop has pretty much every militia item on BP - I'd only been playing a short while, I knew i had to have them.  Between my 40k AUR, I picked up BPs for my cheap assault suit (3,000isk) and reduced it to 240isk.  I started as a logi, so I have a free artificer suit, and now, I have a sensor damped, nanohive-carrying Raven Assault suit that I can lose like it's nobody's business.

As many of you are probably aware, as well as warring with some of their former allies.

Enter us

We were all promised meaningful battles once faction warfare and PC were opened up in Uprising, we become relevant, and the Eve players take more notice, and in turn we become more relevant. Like a successcascade. To do this, They need to open up PC in nullsec. But instead of whatever bonuses they are doing now, instead have district control affect the sovreignty mechanics in a meaningful way. 

****WARNING WHAT FOLLOWS IS JUST IDEAS

So, let's fight on moons!) has x districts. For every 6 (number negotiable) districts on a planet/moon (hereafter refered to as a celestial), there is one POS anchoring fort (POSF, name is a work in progress). The POSF itself will have slots (H/M/L) that can be fitted with modules to give it bonuses that affect ground combat (L), infastructure (M), and the POS (H). Examples: railgun/blaster turrets (better than the current ones, L), shield extenders (H). However, or my personal favorite

Now, this part is way open to suggestions. I think that the % of districts held by the attacker reduce the time it takes to capture a system by up to 50%. So %100 district control means the system flips %50 faster, 0% district control means the mechanics are the same as they are now.

Now
The current war barge orbital strikes stay as current.
Orbiting player strikes now do something like this:
All ships can be lasered onto targets. The targeting laser is a ground merc piece of equipment. when activated
Small ships (frigs/destroyers): 3 second delay between shots fired (Eve-side) and shots arriving (Dust-side)
Medium ships (cruisers/battlecruisers): 7 second delay
Large ships (Battleships): 11 second delay
X-Large (Dreadnoughts): 15 second delay
Titans: 30 second delay
Also

Now, laboratory, whatever), and place it underground. There are 3 levels of underground-ness, each one being more expensive, and adding more defense from orbital strikes. At level 1, all orbital shots have 100% effectiveness. Level 2, medium ships at 75, and Titans at %100. This would also give us more indoor levels and give heavies a chance to be more than just worthless punching bags like now. With narrow hallways and closely-defined fields of fire they would finally have an environment to shine in! While we are on it, +%accuracy boost

I think this makes fleet support much more valuable in ground operations

Now, let them still be there, but only carry that base level of support. But for going above that base level, we should invite new classes of ships specifically for ground assault/support. Call them Panetary Assault XXXX where XXXX is the ship class (frigate, destroyer, cruiser, battlecruiser, carrier). These ships can fit guns/targeting systems that allow for faster/more accurate targeting of ground forces, and laboratories to keep them from degenerating before use. The carriers can also carry a shitton of OMS stuff, lots of good shit.

Anyways, not just accessories like they are now.

CCP had a lot of time to whip this game into shape, sure, but a lot of other things are/were broken, and, worst of all, the game has only gotten worse for newbies. To top it off, a lot of people have tried dust, and went to something else.

Right now, many people are assuming that anything of any real value is going to be years off. It's been over a month since the official commercial launch, and they still only have vehicles for 2 of the four races and heavies for one.

I liked dust when I first got into the beta. I like the idea of dust: integration of two separate and very different games

It has a lot of really badly crippling problems, where most of the game is already established and all they do is tweak it here and there. Dust is a very different animal, one that isn't really established, isn't really growing much, and is generally just doing poorly. 

CCP doesn't really seem to be doing much about that

I started playing back in January during open beta and from what I remember back then we had even less of what we have now (no racial suits at all, less intergration/impact on EVE) plus the graphics were bland and horrible compared to most other games. Yet it was a great game.

Then Uprising came and changed Dust. Added more features

Then instant battle academy came in quickly to keep newberries and older players with alts from getting protostomped. Yet we complained.

Weapons glitches were everywhere and they have fixed some but not all in a timely manner. Yet we complained.

We have complained and left the game because it is an unfinished product. The devolpers are treating it like how they developed EVE

Instead of complaining and QQing and bullshiting maybe we should do something. Try helping a newberry get better so he can survive after instant battle academy. Post videos of how a player can improve their gameplay. And stop all this bullshitting and give the devlopers time to produce more of what we want and what we need.

/endrant.

Edit: Before anyone accuses me of not helping and to give an example of how I help, find newberries, squad up with them, and guide them for a bit. Once an alt has reach the min standards to leave Instant battle academy I terminate said clone and make a new alt and repeat the process.

Edit 2: I probally should have made my point clearly in the first place but here it is: We should not be complaining on websites like Reddit where it probally won't reach the CCP dev team. This will just end up causing the current and potential playerbase to put this game aside and kill Dust before it reaches its full potentional. Instead send complaints to the CPM or the devs themselves as they can make the changes and fixes that need doing.

So far, so sticking with low-end gear allows me to rack up a lot of deaths and still profit. But could I reasonably assume that I'd die less with higher-end gear and still be isk positive?

As of now, so generally my play style has been fairly reckless, kind of a necessity for shotgun scouts.

So for those of you who use higher end gear,False,self,t5_2sh6s,False,,minmatar,t3_1d2epl

But its the not-so-basic things that I don't get. I watched a guy go 15/1 in this one game, you don't have to instruct me on that. That is just going to take time and a bit of devotion.

Also, of my deaths come from. 

I'm not asking for a 1 on 1 tutor (though that would be nice)

Sorry

Anywhat, don't follow the target (put your crosshair/reticule where you think they might go THEN fire), I saw one dude tell me to use heavy suits to prevent 1-shot counter-snipes, Carry nano-hives (I would, but my current suit is kinda low on PG and CPU so... not much room for them). Just general stuff like that. And for the most part, I'm going to follow these tips.
