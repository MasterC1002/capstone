He pointed, we were at an angle so I could see both sides. On the other side of the truck were two black males. One was on the ground by the back wheel, and the other was by the back corner of the truck, in what I would call a rather athletic posture. It is a chilly day for the area, but not horribly cold - their dress is something I wouldn't take into consideration on a day like today.

We walked up to them. The driver knows us well. I told dad to do the talking so I could stay alert. He sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger: ""There are two men casing you on the other side of their truck. I believe they are going to rob you. Lock your truck, and I've never seen IRL people take a few steps, then go the opposite way, then take a few steps, rinse, repeat. They finally calmed down, locked their truck, down a sidewalk.

* Buy a quality holster the first time.  Most holsters that are available on retail shelves appear to be crap.  There's a reason so many of us love our Comp-Tacs

* Unless you're wearing a tight-ass shirt over your full-frame automatic it is not immediately obvious to anyone else that you're carrying.  Even if you print or your shirt rides up a little bit and gets pinched between the grip and your side

* Stop thinking about your gun.

* Seriously, not a gun with a human being attached.

* It's okay for things to shift around a *little* bit.  Obviously, just like you should be a little loose.  But don't be *too* loose - you don't want to be that guy who shot himself while taking a dump in the Rainbow Foods bathroom, do you?

* It's not about having *larger* clothing, take them to the fitting room, and try them on with your holstered pistol.  Pants and shirts of the same size can all fit dramatically different, and a little extra time spent here will pay off in greatly-reduced frustration later on.

* An undershirt or tank helps to keep everything in place and helps to camouflage what's underneath.

* Stiffer belts are better.  A fresh new belt will work better than the one you've been wearing for the last 10 years.  A nice stiff purpose-built gun belt will be even better still.

* Winter coats are awesome, taking your kid to the bathroom, or whatever.

* Speaking of kids

* Carry something smaller and lighter than a stainless P220.  Seriously

Finally

* Get over your fears and carry with one in the chamber.  Seriously, if you need your gun you'll probably be freaking out and won't remember to do it anyway, so do what you can to reduce the number of steps between danger and not-being-dead.  Remember, any modern pistol designed with self defense in mind has multiple internal mechanisms to prevent your gun from going off - which means it just can't happen unless you do something stupid to make it happen.

Now this kid looks very sincere and completely non threatening, I just want to go home"". I shake my head and say no. Suddenly my car violently lurches to the side as I hear my door handles pulled on. I look over and see to large men trying to yank my passenger side doors open. I am in broad daylight in the middle of a crowded intersection cars all around me. ""Open the door motherfucker, get the fuck out"" one of them jumps onto my hood moving across to my side, at that same moment I grabbed for my Glock that was in the side panel of my door and brought it up with my left hand while reaching for my seatbelt release with my right.  The guy instantly saw the gun and began to roll off so I begin to look for the other known threat, the other man had been coming around the back of the car to the drivers side and by the time I swept right and back left looking for him he was already running as well. I did notice a piece of metal in his hand that looked like a thin pipe or rebar. 

My mind is blank, traffic just moves out..... I start to realize the reality of the situation, but what am I supposed to do? My mind goes back to I am late for an important meeting. So I just drive forward and begin to take in what just happened. I put the gun away and debate pulling over. But instead I keep driving.

I was using an ATM at the local branch of my bank. The branch is in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, I noticed a decidedly shady looking individual leaning on the wall about 12 feet to the left of the ATM. He was shady in the sense that he looked like a vagrant, definitely not a guy just waiting for the bus...for the purposes of classification I'll just say he looked like a crack head (though that can be very subjective, I know). Now, I'm a big guy, I can hold my own, I've lived in this city my whole life and it takes a lot for me to get nervous. I've been robbed, as most inner city residents will have over the course of their time. I say that to say that I'm not overly jumpy or suspicious because I know that most of the wackos on the street are just in their own little worlds and present little to no threat despite their appearance. But when he took a few steps closer to the ATM as I was punching numbers

He was on my left and I keep my EDC pistol on my right hip in an IWB holster. As I put in my pin, I unbuttoned my down vest, lifted my shirt to expose the grip and make my gun more available to me. I think my intent at that point was maybe to draw his attention to what I was doing, see I was carrying. The machine dispensed my cash and I began to walk to my car which was in the parking lot adjacent to the bank. The lot is definitely NOT well lit. I was instantly aware of the fact that he was walking behind me, following me to my car. As I walked, I drew my pistol from my holster, making zero attempt to hide what I was doing. I didn't turn around and I didn't point the gun at him

It didn't really hit me what had just occurred until a few minutes later and in hindsight

I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't carrying. Like I said

They were younger guys, around my age (22), I guess they were dressed like ""thugs,"" but what made me uncomfortable was more than their fashion; it was something about the way they were acting, so I was able to keep my eye on them, and I had just been checking my watch so I told them ""1:40, and had this really aggressive look in their eyes; like

It's NOT my personal account


&gt;I had to make a throwaway for this one because Reddit has some very polarized views on the situation I'm about to describe.
&gt;Several years ago I was driving back home from school with my little sister for Christmas break. She was in college, I was passenger. About 2/3 of the way home I notice a car coming up rapidly in the rear view mirror, MUCH faster than our speed of 65-70 mph. It was a white Honda Civic, and it wasn't slowing down even though it was almost on top of us. We couldn't (legally) get out of the way because there was a car in front of us and a car to the right of us, and we were in the far left lane. At the last moment, just as I thought the car was going to hit us, it swerves onto the shoulder, and then cuts in between us and the car in front of us and slams on the brakes.
&gt;Luckily my sister was alert and we are in a car with very good brakes, very intentional. His next move confirmed my fear: as we move into the next lane he slows down even further and then sideswipes our car.
&gt;Luckily we are in a larger vehicle than his and my sister manages to keep it under control. At this point she is panicking, I tell her to stay behind him as best she can and try to get to the exit, leaving him on the highway and unable to follow us. For some reason I will never be able to fully rationalize after the fact, I hold off on calling the police, hoping that we can get away. I guess I figured they couldn't do anything for us at that moment (which is true) and that my sister needed my attention more than anything at that moment. Plus I had his license plate burned into my brain at that point; there'd be plenty of time to talk to the police later.
&gt;The next mile feels like it may as well be 10. There are barely any other cars on the road (probably a good thing), mostly by swerving back and forth across four lanes as he tries to hit us. I try to tell her to wait until the last moment to get into the exit lane, but she wasn't willing to cut it as close as I would have been. Unfortunately she gives the maniac too much warning, and he swerves over at the true last moment and exits in front of us.
&gt;At this moment I decide it's time to call the police. I also remember at about that time that I have a pistol in my bag in the backseat, I reach into the backseat and grab it while 911 is dialing.
&gt;As I'm attempting to describe the situation and our location to the dispatcher, so I tell my sister to get into that lane in the hope that we can go whichever way the maniac doesn't and get the fuck out of there. At this point I've relayed our location to the dispatcher as well as the fact that I am armed.
&gt;As we move into the desired lane approaching the intersection, the fucker turns to block both lanes and stops.
&gt;At this point, he clearly wants to hurt us. And if he is willing to get out of the car and come after us, he's probably armed. I tell the dispatcher the situation and inform her I'm going to have to hang up. I don't remember what she said after that; I honestly wasn't listening anymore. For a few seconds the car just sits there, and my sister starts to back up to put some distance between us and him. I think to myself that maybe he doesn't have the guts to go through with it, but then I remember he has already tried to kill us and fucked both of our cars up in the process.
&gt;Then the door opens, looked to be in his mid-20s just like us, wearing an oversized light-blue hoodie and baggy jeans. He looked angry as fuck, and he started to walk toward the car. My mind is still racing, I look one last time for an exit, see that there just isn't one that won't put us in danger if he has a gun (we'd have to drive right past him), and realize that's it. I open the door and get out of the car, and start yelling at him. I don't remember exactly what I said, I have to assume he could see the my sister though the windshield). I remember up to that point thinking over and over again that this can't be happening, or anything like that. All I'm thinking about is my little sister. I raise my gun and fire once
&gt;Of course after all this, it was a stolen gun at that, and it was later found that he was both drunk and high on cocaine (which I guess explains why all of this happened, since there is no other explanation). On top of that, one of the motorists on the highway who saw his original attempts to run us off the road called the cops even before I did, although she was older and didn't give them a reliable location so that they could get to us before... it... happened. She did, however, and beyond having to go through the very lengthy testimony and investigation process there wasn't much in the way of legal implication for me.
&gt;The crazy thing is
&gt;It's true what they say about the experience of killing someone. No matter the circumstances or the justification, my little sister, and he deserved what happened to him. I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to, although with the benefit of this experience I would call the cops much earlier in the hope that I wouldn't have to. Honestly though, given the time it took for them to arrive I'm not sure that it could have been prevented even if I'd called as soon as he first sideswiped us.

****Update**** - I dropped the monitor off at the hospital earlier today and stopped by member services to discuss the situation with one of the administrators.  I told her the story as I wrote it here and made it clear that I totally understand their desire to keep everyone safe

She stated that HIPAA rules allow security to enter hospital rooms when safety could potentially be compromised

The administrator seemed professional, and I left.

I do plan on following up with the administrator once I receive written correspondence from her.

**Sorry in advance for the long story

I was at an appointment at a Kaiser Permanente in Northern California today to get fitted for a holter monitor (to track my heart rate for the next 24 hours)

Once the appointment started, and asked me to remove the pistol from my waistband and set it on the counter so that she could prep me for the monitor.  I gladly obliged and set it on the counter facing in a safe direction.  She told me that it was hospital policy to notify security if a patient was carrying a concealed weapon, and stepped out into the hallway to do so.  She returned a few minutes later and said that one of the security officers might want to chat with me, and then began to shave my chest and prep me for the monitor.  We're having a conversation about what I do for work and why I carry, to which I replied ""I work at xxxx company, but don't carry for work reasons.  I carry for my own personal safety.""  She says that she totally understands why someone would want a CCW, and says that her husband is trying to get his too. 

Not even a minute later and all hell breaks loose.

Two security officers appear at the door and proceed to enter the room without permission.  The main security officer sees my gun on the counter, although I'm not too happy that these guys are in the room while I'm shirtless and being prepped for a medical procedure.  The security officers ask why I'm carrying in a hospital, to which I reply ""I have a concealed weapons permit, and it's my legal right to do so.  There are no signs prohibiting firearms on the premises so it's legal for me to carry inside this facility."" (FYI - CA is odd about these rules, and my county technically has a restriction for carrying a weapon in businesses where signs are posted prohibiting firearms).  The officer nods his head, and then asks the nurse how much longer the appointment is going to be.  She says it's only going to be a few minutes more, and that she's cool with my weapon on the counter, and say that they have to wait and watch me and my pistol until the operation is complete (mind you, I can't really leave).  At this point he's already got the pistol in his hand (without my consent)

Another minute later, the pistol is loaded.  I have a concealed weapons permit, and it's my legal right to carry in this hospital.""  The supervisor is now dicking around with the gun in the holster, is holding the gun by the muzzle with his hand over the barrel, and is slightly sliding the gun out of the holster.  I'm just waiting for him to launch a round through his hand at this point.  

The nurse finally finishes up, to which I replied that no such laws exist, and that they should post signs prohibiting firearms if they really don't want people carrying in the hospital.  He realizes I'm not trying to be a total dick, agrees with me, and tells me to never carry my pistol again in his hospital.  He then hands me my gun and asks me to reholster and leave at my leisure.  I'm pretty heated, but I put my gun away and leave without any other words.

Here's a twist though - Later on in the day I run into my friend's mom, and then proceeds to tell me that the security officers were in violation of patient privacy rules as stated by HIPAA regulation since they entered the hospital room without my consent, and that I should file a complaint through member services as a result.  I knew that they were not supposed to be in the room without my permission, but I didn't realize that there was regulations prohibiting their actions.

1371435125.0,1ghlhw,This just happened. Stay aware of your surroundings.,OffensiveWords,189,31,40,"TL;DR. Someone approached my vehicle while I was at a drive up ATM. Began to draw when person changed their mind when they realized they were noticed. Keep your eyes open.

I had to run by an ATM. I went to a drive up ATM for the convenience at approximately 21:15. The bank is in a strip mall with a gas station that is located at the corner of the lot

I get my card out and notice someone at the gas station walking from a pump towards my car/ATM. Then the person stops, did not have a clue if the person was in a vehicle that was at a pump or what the case was. I simply noticed the person paying attention to me. I continue my transaction while keeping an eye on my vehicle's mirrors and the mirror on the ATM a little higher alert than normal. I noticed the same person coming up behind the car. While I'm fully aware that someone could be walking up to the drive up ATM to get cash for a purchase and simply waiting in line, they are approaching in a manner that seemed as if the person were lining up to come between the ATM and my car. 

I was finishing my transaction waiting on my receipt at this point when the person was almost touching my tail light and looking behind, when at that point I spoke up. I have a deep voice that carries well, so I knew I would be heard and hoped I would draw attention. I simply stated ""You are way too close to my vehicle, you need to give me some space."" At that point, the person was startled and moved at a quick pace, not a run, towards the corner of the strip mall. Away from the other ATM and the gas station all together.

That line of thinking annoys me. It's true that we should take all reasonable measures to avoid situations where violence could occur but to sit back on your computer chair and stick up your nose and say ""well just don't get in those situations"" seems pompous at best.

Isn't the point of this subreddit to talk about the purpose of carrying a concealed weapon and to encourage others in safely doing this? Nobody wants to get in a situation where their weapon is necessary but things DO happen

There's been some posts of CCW'er's sticking up for/defending people that could potentially be in danger that have come under alot of fire from people in this subreddit that seems unreasonable. I carry to protect myself and the innocent around me. Not to sit in my car or run away if something bad befalls someone else. Nor do I go around looking to play Policeman.

So

I was carrying IWB on my right hip at the time.  Officer asked for license, especially because officers here on reddit have said it puts them at ease because when they see the permit they immediately know you are not a felon or diagnosed with any serious mental issues.  The likelihood of the traffic stop turning dangerous immediately drops to a very tiny percentage when they know you're eligible for a permit to carry.  Not to mention permit holders commit crimes on a much smaller scale than the average citizen... but I digress

The officer looked at both and asked me if I had my weapon and where it was.  I said ""Yes

That's where the gun conversation ended.   No fuss, etc.  He said he'd check my license and be back.  He returned and asked me to make sure I get my headlight fixed as soon as possible.

End of traffic stop.  No problems.  I was surprised he didn't even say anything like ""Just keep your hands on the wheel

So, and might be nervous about it.  I know I was after seeing horror stories of people being disarmed, muzzle swept by their own weapon, or screamed at like a criminal.

Concealed Carriers typically carry a firearm with standard magazine capacities of 13 to 21 rounds. /r/guns recommends a Glock 19 (15 round standard capacity) as the first handgun a person should purchase. Any magazine ban is going to have huge effects on concealed carriers.  

Vice President Biden has commented extensively on hunters and sportsmen

We number more than twice the members of the NRA, but will do nothing to stop violent criminals. In short, they lose any real credibility in asking for magazine bans as soon as they recognize us.  

Let's force them to recognize us. When you [write your representatives](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml), how well trained we are, how unlikely we are to commit any sort of crime, let alone a violent crime.

I'm walking up a cross street (broad daylight roughly 2pm) and I get to the end and 3 guys walk out from the corner and block my way.

I go to move around them and they move infront of me again. The one directly infront of me says ""hey homie, gimme your wallet and your phone anyways"". I stepped back and he started to reach in his pocket and I said ""I think you're making a mistake, just let me go and nothing needs to happen"" he took a step toward me now with a steak knife in his hand and said ""I'm not going to ask you again, give me your fucking wallet or me and my boys are going to fuck you up"" as he was stepping forward I reached for my pistol and raised it up and took a defensive stance and told him not to move towards me again. He backed up and said ""Oh shit dis nigger got a gun!"" then ran off. That was all that happened but by this point, it doesn't phase me anymore and I just go into auto pilot. The kicker is that there were people watching this whole altercation and didn't say or do anything. I found a policeman on the next corner and told him what happened and he called it in but basically I got told nothing was going to be done about it.

This is the third time I've had to draw on someone while living in this area and every time it happens I have never been happier and more relieved to have gotten a CCW.

But I expect this experience will make me both more prepared and also safer.

Hopefully our kid will also re-consider when he thinks about sneaking out again.

I walk outside, filming with my phone as she hasn't stopped driving yet. I explain to her that she damaged my property and she admits to doing so, we examine the damage on both vehicles

She's pleasant

I'm not privy to the other end of the phone conversation, she sees me doing this so then starts loudly claiming that I ""threatened and intimidated her"" and starts making a scene. She continues telling me that I'm threatening her and intimidating her and that I came outside swearing and yelling at her (all of which is on video that proves she's lying). Realizing that I am carrying and the sheriff is on the way I start to worry and head back inside. 

Once the sheriff arrives the woman makes the same claims but thankfully the sheriff didn't care. She (the sheriff) looks at the damage on both cars, etc. Notes that I was nowhere near my car when this happened and therefore am not at fault, and makes up a nice police report.

1347601866.0,zv4zv,Helped a cop arrest a guy on campus today,tm0g,109,18,104,"I do carry

I was sitting outside and talking with a friend on my cell when I heard some yelling sounds in the distance. I was a curious what was going on so I got up and started looking around. I noticed people standing outside of a doorway and looking in.

I walked in and saw a single cop wrestling with a black dude who was on the floor. The man was loudly shouting and complaining. As I slowly approached

As the phone rang I noticed that the cop was really struggling to get the man under control. My original intention was only to be a good witness

Once I had approached (cautiously) to within about ten feet of the men I asked the officer if he wanted my help. I can't remember exactly what he said but he beckoned me over. I can't remember the exact order of events

I did my best to help by holding the man down and trying to get his right hand behind his back as directed by the officer. I tried to talk the man down as well by telling him that I wanted to help him and asking him to calm down. That didn't seem to help. 

This man was strong. I mean really strong. I'm about 6ft 175lbs and I could barely keep just his right arm behind his back. One scary thing that I noticed was that the man grabbed at the cops duty belt with his right hand. I guess campus police officers don't carry guns

It took a while to get both the man's hands behind his back

Once the handcuffs were on the man we kept holding him down until backup arrived. I asked the cop to let me know when he wanted me to back off

Once cops started arriving they asked me to step back. I gave them my contact info and briefly told them what had happened. 

I gained a lot of respect for what cops go through. Throughout the entire encounter the man yelled about police brutality and excessive force

I suspect that the cop would have gotten by just fine without my help

What really bothered me was the behavior of the onlookers. No one else intervened to help the cop

But anyway, and Illinois license plates (I recently moved to NE). So he kindly asks me to exit my vehicle to come to his patrol car (I sat in the front seat) while he sorts out the hodgepodge of paperwork I gave him. As he is verifying my CCP, lack of criminal history, and vehicle tags... I noticed his M&amp;P 15 and we start talking about guns. This conversation goes on for about 15 minutes and was quite pleasant. He hands me a warning for not having switched to Nebraska license plates and never even mentioned the speeding. My take on the situation is that gun enthusiasts unite. It was my first time being pulled over with my CCW on me and having remembered that **the first thing to do is declare your weapon,** it was a pretty good experience... relatively speaking.

February I took my CCW class. Fast forward to April, I'm trying to get used to having something in my waistband so when my permit comes I'm use to carrying (my logic?). At first she didn't think anything of it until we got back into my car. She said something about if I was serious about carrying one day

* I don't want you to hurt yourself.

* I don't want you to pull the gun out in anger. How do I know you won't shoot me when I piss you off?

* I don't want you to accidentally shoot someone if the gun were to go off.

* Why do you need to carry?

* I don't like the idea of you having a gun on you everyday all day.

My counter points were as follows (summarized)

* Accidents do not happen with firearms

* She thinks I have anger issues. I don't, I asked myself, can I handle this responsibility? I find myself actually avoiding confrontation if I have it within a close proximity. Further more, I told her if she is truly worried about me shooting her, she doesn't need to be with me at all. I don't know where the hell she is getting this from. She is the one who always threatens me. One instance we were in the kitchen with her mother and her mom started talking about ""Oh what if irlyh8usernames ever cheated on you?"" (side note, she's 100% pureto rican) and my girlfriend goes ""Just like you told me mom, cut his dick off in the kitchen and make it look like an accident."" I don't know why I didn't run... My point here being, but she has at me and she is afraid I'm the one who would hurt her?

* Again

* I need to carry for the same reason you need a fire extinguisher in your house. I plan on carrying on me in public as well, I want to be able to send bullets back in their direction in order to stop my threat.

* I tried to compromise with her here and even stated I wouldn't carry on me if I were around her. I told her a big reason for wanting to be able to carry is my job.

Does anyone have a problem similar to mine? I've taken her shooting twice, my next gun purchase will be the gun I plan on carrying, etc.

First
bran·dish 
Pronunciation: \ˈbran-dish\
Function: transitive verb 
Etymology: Middle English braundisshen, from brant, braund sword, of Germanic origin; akin to Old English brand Date: 14th century 
1 : to shake or wave (as a weapon) menacingly 
2 : to exhibit in an ostentatious or aggressive manner

This is the literal definition of the word brandish. Consult all applicable laws for the legal term and its implications. 


Generally, I am going to fire"" could turn around to bite you in the ass as you're engraving in your mind that the second your sights are on the threat, you pull the trigger. What if the threat is neutralized as I said, by running away or backing down? Welp, now you're pulling the trigger and putting a bullet in a fleeing or surrendering subject.  There are numerous cases like this to draw upon, both CC and home defense, where the shooter did just that, because the accounts of those are easy enough to find (google it

Where is this going? To the range. It's likely that many of you practice draw-to-fire drills, sights would immediately go on target AND your finger would pull the trigger. That leaves no time whatsoever to asses the situation before you commit the irrevocable and life changing action of pulling the trigger on another human. Sometimes shit happens (isn't that why we carry?) and people cannot stop themselves from pulling the trigger. Don't let that be you. Change your mindset and alter your training drills a bit to give yourself a short moment to asses the situation when you're able to, and act with force rapidly only when you have no choice.

It's not just your life that could be affected by an improperly trained index finger and an undisciplined mindset so conduct yourself in a manner befitting someone with the power and responsibility of carrying a loaded firearm.

Backstory: I applied for and received my CCW (called CPL where I live, I applied for and received my medical marijuana card (called the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program or 'MMMP' card here). 

Once I received my card, and I know many will disagree with me here, it's irresponsible to carry a Glock while also carrying a weed card. That's just me, so I stopped carrying firearms all together. My CPL expired in November, and I let it lapse because my MMMP card was still active.

Well, and asked if I could use him for a reference since I have to have two references on my renewal application. He told me I had a problem.

He said he knew about my marijuana card and that I was no longer eligible for a CPL. He said it would be a violation of Federal law for them to approve it. This was news to me

Well, I am not trying to purchase a gun. I guess I'm not seeing the problem here. Am I screwed? Does my contact have it wrong? Is my county about to cross a line it's illegal/unconstitutional for them to cross? 

**TL;DR --** Got a CCW in 2008, was told I can't. Have I lost my right to a CCW because I once had a weed card?

**EDIT --** Wow! I did not expect such a big response. Thank you, and update in subsequent days/weeks as I get through the process. Here's hoping all goes well. If not... Well you'll be along for the ride either way. Thanks again, everyone. ",,False,,t5_2s4mc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1a8uia/medical_marijuana_and_ccw_did_i_unknowingly_give/

Anyway, and my father and I walk into a grocery store to purchase some paper plates in anticipation of Thanksgiving (classy family). 

I make it three steps in the door, and hits me in the foot. I look down, and prevent myself from saying anything at all because I don't want anyone to look. I slip the gun back in the holster, stuff the whole mess under my shirt, and walk past the cashiers out the door, muttering something like ""Dropped something, be right back."" 

I went outside, then came back inside, shaking from adrenalin dump and embarrassment. 

Thankfully, however, dressed professionally, and my undershirt had ""[MY CITY] FIRE DEPARTMENT"" on it, so it was probably clear I wasn't a shady dude. 

Anyway, then he says, ""Let's talk about what you dropped in there."" My dad is extremely anti-gun, but he was surprisingly cool; he respected my decision, but he told me I should make a learning experience out of it. 

So that's what I'm doing here.

What did we learn? 

1) Cheap

2) Looking professional probably prevented me from having the cops called. 

3) Don't panic.

A story about open carry
Last night, and I was about 10 minutes behind her.  About five minutes out of town, on a very dark stretch of interstate, she saw a vehicle stopped on the side of the road with an older gentleman walking down the interstate towards the next town.  She passed too quickly, but called me and asked me to stop and offer help.


I, I would be carrying.  I haven’t received my CCW license yet, but Louisiana is an Open Carry state, so I knew I was well within my rights to be armed.  I stopped about fifteen yards behind them, got out of my vehicle and approached the older gentleman.  


I greeted him and asked if there was anything that I could do to help.  He said they (he was travelling with his wife) had overheated and were trying to make it to the next exit.  They had been on the road for just over five hours.  I told him that I would do whatever I could do to help them and proceeded to walk back to their van with him.


I decided that he was not a threat to my safety

**Her**: “So what do you do that you carry that?” She points to my gun

**Me**: “I’m actually a student.  I didn’t know who y’all were and didn’t want to get in a bad situation”

**Her**: “Oh no

After limping along, and he was also very supportive of both me stopping and of me carrying.  Apparently there have been a few robberies of people stopped on the side of the road and the sheriff was glad to have someone with them.


**tl;dr**


Not everyone is against open carry.  Both the couple that I stopped to help tonight and the sheriff that responded to our call were very supportive of it

1352671179.0,13119k,Is brandishing ever appropriate?,non_troppo,80,12,80,"I've heard conflicting opinions from various friends

The question is - is it ever appropriate to brandish your gun without firing it? Some people are of the mindset that firing your gun should be your absolute last line of defense, or merely making your attacker aware that you are armed and capable of using deadly force - should be pursued before you consider putting your finger on the trigger. A lot of people probably get this idea from ~~Jeff Cooper, who suggests in Principles of Self Defense~~ a popular forum post entitled 'Street Robberies and You,' which suggests that pulling your jacket back to reveal your handgun or some similar show of force is an effective means of deterring a would-be attacker in a dark parking lot.

The other end of the spectrum says that drawing your gun must always be associated with firing your gun. Draw, holster.

Obviously both have their pros and cons. If you choose to brandish your weapon without firing it, if you disassociate drawing your weapon with firing it and draw your weapon on someone who wouldn't have otherwise warranted a show of force, you could face criminal charges for wrongfully brandishing a deadly weapon. There are also some that say that any show of force short of firing your weapon only serves to alert your attacker that you are armed, and gives them motivation to fire on you when they otherwise may not have had chance or reason to do so.

What does everyone think?

For the sake of conversation let's assume the following scenario. You're walking to your car late at night, and begin to approach you. They are not armed as far as you can tell, but they are much bigger than you and could obviously wreck your day if they wanted to. If you do nothing, they could soon draw close enough to you with malice that firing on them is no longer a feasible option. If you brandish but do not fire, you could provoke a deadly attack from someone who may not have otherwise attacked you, or you could draw on an innocent person who will then call the police and have you arrested for wrongfully brandishing a deadly weapon. If you draw and fire, you are attacking an unarmed (as far as you can tell) person who may have simply mistaken your car for theirs in the dark.

**edit:** somehow got 'Street Robberies and You' mixed up with 'Principles of Self Defense'

**edit 2:** By brandish I just mean drawing your weapon without immediately firing it - giving the aggressor a chance to stop his actions before you pull the trigger. Apparently the definition of brandishing implies showing a weapon menacingly/aggressively.

I have no criminal record, but I like to think I'm up there.  I'm also the most modest.

So I go to the State Police of New Hampshire's website

As a Vermont resident

[The New Hampshire form states] (http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/nhsp/ssb/permitslicensing/documents/dssp260.pdf) 

""**Or if you are a Vermont resident, and that, to the best of the department's knowledge, 

-You have never been denied a license to carry.

-You have never been convicted of a felony which has not been Annulled

-You are not a user of controlled drugs or narcotics without orders from a physician

-You have not been treated for mental illness

-You have no domestic violence petitions that would prevent possession of weapons under federal statute

-In any court of a misdemeanor of domestic violence.

OK

So I go to my local police department

Finally, because we can't perform a background check on you unless you are under arrest.  
After an hour of being pushed around
Ok

I go to the local State Trooper station, however, since he can't run my name without me being arrested. I thank him profusely for his help, and leave after about a 1/2 hour.

So I call the NH State police licencing department, if that would suffice, with the letter from the State trooper.

They tell me that a background check is unnecessary

OK.  Deep breaths.

Day 2.

I wake up this morning, and get a notarized copy on official letterhead stating that I have no criminal record in the State of Vermont..  Sweet.

I then call my local PD, just swing by the station.

I drive 40 mins. back to town.

I get to the PD station

20 minutes later, or to take the BAR exams.  It's just ""something they don't do.""

RAGE.

So what do I do now?

I contact the Sheriff (had already called 3 times with no answer).  And leave a message.  Then I decide to drive to his office and talk to him in person.  To his credit, because..

1. He doesn't know whether the notarized background check is authentic.

2. He doesn't know that I don't use drugs

among other reasons.  He even made it a point to mention that he doesn't sign NFA ATF forms

OK.  Thank him for his time.  He just lost a vote.

Finally decide to just send in the information as-is

I have seen the belly of the beast

What is funny about all of this is, and cross the border with their weapon concealed.

Just had to vent.  If you have any advise please post below.

I'm feeling awfully dejected today.

**The Swagger**
If any of you live or have spent time in a bad part of town then you are probably familiar with the walk I have dubbed The Ghetto Swagger.  This unusual gait is typified by dramatically swinging or dipping shoulders

My wife and I had stopped for fuel near a CostCo in Seaside, and probably a faux-historic downtown district with overpriced boutiques.  Reality was somewhat different: a grubby gas station, restrooms covered in Aryan Brotherhood and other gang tags, and one out-of-state white boy in an SUV towing two flashy motorcycles and looking very, very out of place; needless to say, I wanted to get my fuel and get the hell out of there.  

I was standing next to the pump as I was fueling up and making sure to check my surroundings every few seconds without looking too conspicuous; as I did I noticed a guy with a big puffy knee-length coat strutting right towards me with The Ghetto Swagger.  He was staring intently at me and it was clear that he was moving with a purpose.  While keeping an eye on him, thought better of approaching me.  He turned and exited the gas station property and I watched him until he reached the corner of the block.

**Oakland**

We were at a friend's condo in Oakland and left around 11:30 at night.  We were on our motorcycles and one in our party had to get fuel right away so we stopped at the closest gas station.  In the time it takes to pump 5-6 gallons of fuel we had one guy get uncomfortably close asking for money and another guy who was probably tripping come within inches of me and my bike while rambling about the motorcycles being ""time machines"".  The group that worried me the most was the half-dozen or so young males that appeared from behind the gas station's small payment shack to stand several yards behind us while my friend fueled up.  They continued to inch closer and closer and appeared to be trying to goad each other into doing something.  I signaled my wife to keep her bike running and to run like hell if anything happened (we are used to communicating with hand signals).  My friend finally finished fueling after what seemed like ages and we got the hell out of there.

Yesterday is a perfect example why. 

I went for a walk with my dog along a trail that is very close to my house. There are nature trails, etc. so it's pretty popular. I wasn't five minutes into the walk when a young guy and girl came up asking me if I had seen any loose dogs. After a short conversation with them, I wanted to say that, here, alone on a trail with my dog, with your two, fully grown approximately 80 pound pit bulls loose without a collar or tags are exactly the reason why I don't feel safe walking around and particularly with my dog. 

Nothing happened and I never saw the dogs but when I got home

This isn't meant to be a negative post about Pit Bulls...it was more the owners fault and clearly any dogs that he (approximately 18 to 22 y/o) owned were not likely to be well behaved. That's the point though. Some people think I carry because I think I'm going to be in a shoot out at the OK Corral but the truth is,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,,t3_1j7pq9

&gt;God damn. That sounds so scary

After the whole discussion I had with my girlfriend about why people think ""guns are scary, so he's probably going to hang around out there for a while to find a victim.  I don't want him to see me arm myself... that gives him a major advantage.

Then again

Yes.  I EDC a full-sized 1911 .45 ACP.  I'm looking into a Glock 36 for my new carry weapon and keeping the 1911 at home.

More clarification:  I generally keep my pistol in my door pocket in my car because the handle started chewing up the seats.  It's still readily available, I'll toss the holster on my hip, holster the gun, and go from there.  Of course, I do this with the doors closed and ensure nobody's around to see it.

1374713769.0,1izv9b,Something that happened at the store yesterday that made me realize something.,bu472,85,32,81,"So

I was at the store yesterday buying a gallon of milk because we were out  at home and you just can't make scrambled eggs fluff up without it.  While I was in the dairy section trying to decide between 1% and 2% (I chose 2%) a man came up next to me.  I looked over at him and saw he was wearing a t-shirt that had writing on it.  Well, said ""yea, no ones gunna fuck with this"", pulled up his shirt to reveal an openly carried 1911.  I said ""nice gun"", grabbed my milk, and proceed to leave.  Now, here are the morals of the story that I realized when thinking about it today.

1.  Wear clothes that are appropriate in the situation.  This includes tucking in the part of your shirt over your gun so that when you open carry it's actually visible.

2.  Your clothing says a lot to potential threats.  Wearing a shirt that essentially screams ""I HAVE A GUN, LOOK AT ME!"" is probably not the worst idea at a gun show but anywhere else might not be a great idea.  What do you think a potential robber or shooter will think when he see's that shirt?  Probably something along the lines of ""I should shoot that guy first, he has a gun.""

3.  Open carry eliminates basically any tactical advantage you have in a force escalation situation.  You will become the primary target of the attacker.

For the first time I was consciously prepared to use my CCW.,NebraskaGunOwner,71,16,115,"Yesterday, but I soon saw that it was a [very muscular Rottweiler](http://outfitnm.com/wp-content/uploads/Rottweiler-Big-Dog-Picture.jpg).

I have nothing against certain breeds

Baxter, to act more aggressively as not to seem weak.

So were both standing their stopped on the sidewalk and can see that the Rottweiler is making his way toward our direction. I turned us around and started heading back the way we came. It didn't take long

I remember thinking I could run up to a nearby house or hop in a pickup with an open bed in a driveway. But there was almost no time. The Rottweiler was on us in seconds.

At this point

He was doing a kind of ""testing the water"" thing. Moving toward us then backing away quickly. I was pretty freaked out at this point. For the first time since carrying (which hasn't been that long compared to some) I made a conscious decision that I would be prepared to use my CCW depending on how the next few moments went down. I think we have all come to some level of mental preparation and acceptance that we might have to defend ourselves or loved ones one day - and as CCW holders we must be responsible for our actions. But this was different

Because this wasn't a mugger with a knife or gun. I was in this kind of limbo stage of unsureness and I didn't like it.

Now, putting myself in danger.

Baxter wasn't backing down and was pulling at the leash and barking. I'm certain he would have defended me to his death. The Rottweiler was getting amped up and started growling with his head haunched low. I was shouting ""Hey! Go! Get Away!"".  He was inching closer to us - not backing away. I pulled my jacket back and had my hand on my CCW. I literally thought at any second he would leap at us and I would need to defend us.

""SAM! GET BACK HERE!"". A woman had come into my vision from behind the Rottweiler and pulls on a collar that I didn't see seconds before. ""I'm so sorry! I know he looks dangerous but he is really nice!"".

And just like that

I pulled my jacket forward and was at a loss for words. I could tell she was embarrassed and was trying to get out of there. I remember mumbling something like ""No worries"". When really I was thinking ""Lady I almost shot your fucking dog! Don't let a dog like that out of your sight!""

So yea, I *felt* different. I'm sure it was a mixture of adrenaline and/or fear - but for me it was as real as staring down a man with a knife.

I thought about this situation for a bit and wish I did two things differently. I had my phone on me and should have started recording the moment the Rottweiler was heading our direction. I could drop the phone if need be

I also should have walked up to a house immediately and knocked on a door. I remember having a feeling of embarrassment of being afraid of a dog. That pride needed to be literally checked at the door.

First a bit of background: I live in Michigan. I have a CPL permit in Michigan. I was driving to South Carolina for a funeral.

The Story:

I was on the last leg of my trip going EB on I-26 around 3A.M. I have a G30SF holstered in the drivers door pocket. After 12 hours in the car my mind starts to wander and to be honest Im preoccupied with my sisters death. I inadvertently creep past the speed limit and I pass a cop under an overpass. I see his headlights come on and I knew it was game over. It takes about a mile for him to flip on his take down lights and I promptly pull over. Of course there is a million thoughts going through my head. ""Shit, open all the windows and put both hands at 12o'clock on the wheel. The officer come up to the passenger side door and introduces himself very politely. No attitude, no rhetorical questions, just professional and polite. 

LEO: Hi

Me: Hi

LEO:I'm pulling you over because I clocked you at 79 in a 70. Where are you heading?

Me: Columbia sir. 

LEO: (shining his flashlight around the car)Ok

Me: (interrupting him) Sir before we go any further I have a CPL in my home state and there is a weapon in the car. 

LEO: Where?

Me: (moving my left leg) In the door pocket sir.

LEO: Ok

Me: Hey as a Law Enforcement student I totally understand. Ill allow you to open the door and take the gun. Its holstered

LEO: (Opens door

At this time we have a brief chit chat about where Im going, ect. (I know Reddit never talk to cops, yeah yeah yeah.) He then goes back to the cruiser and does his thing. He comes back and asks me to open the trunk. I do so and he come back to the drivers door. 

LEO: Alright sir. I put your gun in the trunk. The mag is out and the slide is locked back. I hope you don't take offense to me putting it back there. 

Me: Absolutely not! 

At this time he tells me to slow it down, had a superiority complex, or anything of the sort. 

So Officer Diaz who patrolled the last few miles of I-26 before the NC/SC line, and no superiority complex. I just wish I knew what agency you worked for so I can write a letter.

EDIT: Alright fellow Redditors I can see where this is going. Everyone want to get all up in arms about rights and thats great (no it really is). However please understand that he asked and I could have easily said no. But I didnt and thats MY choice. I dont want this to turn into a cop-bashing-circle-jerk.

In light of the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, however, is an effort that more broadly addresses ways to spend federal dollars more wisely when it comes to treating and identifying those who are mentally ill as well as intervening before they tragically impact their own lives and the lives of others. 

There are no easy answers here. I continue to believe that a weapons ban does not fix the issue. Whatever we do

Mr Bral
 
I am a current student at Portland Community College, to conceal or open carry on PCC campus, faculty buildings, and student learning buildings. As per the PCC Student Rights document available online at pcc.edu, section 12, subsection 19:
 
""The use, or displaying of any weapon (as defined by Oregon Revised Statute 161.015), or facsimiles thereof, is prohibited on or in College facilities, except as provided by Oregon law or when approved by College administration for official College activities.""
 
From the above text, students are not allowed to bring firearms on campus or in college facilities except provided by Oregon law, which would obviously include a trained and permit holding student or individual to legally conceal or open carry on campus. I am writing today, as previously stated, to clarify current internal college policy.
 
Your response to this matter is appreciated in advance

I usually continue to conceal carry a smaller gun in case I need disarm the visible sidearm to go somewhere and still be concealed

My pro-gun friends have even asked me why I'm carrying my full frame ""sidearm"" and after I explained it to them that I'm doing it for publicity for the 2A issues in the media right now they've all said they thought it was a good idea. 

Here's the full explanation of the reasons why I've started.  I'm considered a good role model and a leader in my community.  I do a lot of work with kids, disadvantaged, etc. students as well.   I'm also a known Democrat and know to identify as liberal on most social issues (not that that makes me pro or anti-gun, but I'm just giving all this info for background purposes).  Some of the people I've carried around have been people I've worked on some of these social issues with as well that aren't always gun friendly.  I believe that seeing someone like me supporting gun rights and exercising my 2A rights should let people that are unsure about how they feel about guns know that there are good people that carry every day, and there are ""good""  people who carry guns all throughout their community.  They just usually don't see them because they're concealed.  

I decided to start doing this because of a discussion a friend and I had while out to dinner with some of my friends that are very pro-2A

I would like to encourage as many people as can to do this.  Like I said, social drinking only - I've never driven under the influence, nothing in my house could be used to convict me of a crime (no you still can't search any of my property without a warrant (: ).  If you can't say similar types of things, according to your own belief system, I would advise not making yourself a poster child for the cause in your community.

I've been very surprised by the number of discussions my open carrying has inspired.  I've not had anyone react negatively

Educating people with common sense and a rational level headed bit of information tends to go a long way.  I'm just as fired up about this issue

What do you all think

My final warning is to make sure you know if open-carry is legal in your state and community.  We only need positive press for 2A issues right now!  Look here for information about where it's legal to open carry: http://www.opencarry.org/?page_id=103 but don't only use this.  Check with your local PD

A Waffle House opened up on my block not too long ago, I thought, I am authorized by the state to carry a concealed firearm, so I'm fine.

The first few times I went there I openly carried my utility knife on my belt that I use for work (I am an organic farmer).  Nobody cared or said anything, even walking by cops, going into all sorts of retail stores, even grocery stores with off-duty cop security guards.  

The last time I went to Waffle House, and off course he was super friendly because I tip extremely well.  Anyway, this manager was off-duty and sitting down the counter and looked at my knife.  He said, ""is that a knife?"" and I said, ""yes, it is"", and he said, please leave"".  I gave him a funny look and said

He points me over to the sign and says, IT IS NOT UNLESS IT IS USED AS A WEAPON and that there is absolutely no law against open carrying knives of any size in Ohio (concealed is a different story).  A deadly weapon, under Ohio law, can be a lamp or a fork or anything that can cause serious bodily harm.  He wasn't having any of it.

So then I said, but what about firearms?"" (because if he unreasonably discriminates against one, I wanted to make sure I was OK with the other)

He says, so I decide just to leave.  Never going back to Waffle House.  Fuck that.  Even Starbucks respects local laws and allows you to open carry firearms in their stores (even had a nice conversation with a knife-collecting barista about my knife).  Apparently Waffle House cannot trust their own customers.

I tried to contact Waffle House on their website about this

Question:
I'm a New Yorker, was it fairly easy in your state? Also, do you carry it with you all the time? If so I'm assuming for protection? Do you live/work in a dangerous area and how quickly would you be willing to use it?

My reply:
&gt;Is there a reason you carry a concealed weapon?

I assume your asking why i carry in general as opposed to open carry.

I guess there are 4 reasons.

1. Because i can. I know that sounds silly but there is just something to it I've always liked.

2. Self defense. Kinda of obvious

3. To express my constitutional rights. Its kinda of self explanatory but i feel that our rights as citizens are being slowly eroded

Why The Gun Is Civilization
By Marko Kloos
March 23
http://munchkinwrangler.wordpress.com/2007/03/23/why-the-gun-is-civilization/

Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, without exception. Reason or force, that’s it.

In a truly moral and civilized society, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.

When I carry a gun, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.

There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that we’d be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, is only true if the mugger’s potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat–it has no validity when most of a mugger’s potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many, and that’s the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.

Then there’s the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, sticks, or stones don’t constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon that’s as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldn’t work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn’t both lethal and easily employable.

When I carry a gun, only persuaded. I don’t carry it because I’m afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn’t limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation…and that’s why carrying a gun is a civilized act.

In July of last yr I was riding the bike through the local park here in California (Solano County). I was passing a two people (man/woman) and words were exchanged between myself and the male, thinking nothing more of it. (I won't get too specific here because I'm concerned that doing so my be problematic if this goes to court) 

I usually park the car a few blocks away from the park entrance because it's easier to exit. As I was mounting my bike on my car rack the man who I had that very minor confrontation with drove by and yelled: *“Fucking homo”*  out his window.

I flipped him off so he made a U-turn then parked approximately 50-60 feet down the block on the same side of the street.  He then exited his car and started walking toward me in a threatening manner. As he neared me I stopped what I was doing, pointed it directly at my face, then asked me: *“Do you want to fuck around now?”*

I answered *“No

Which is ridiculous considering **he turned his car around and approached me** as I was attempting to mount/secure my bike and stow my items in my car.

I did call the police but the officer didn't take a written statement

A few days pass and I get a phone call from that officer and he informs me that the man who pulled a gun on me wrote me an apology and that the man wanted him to forward said apology to me. A few minutes later that officer arrived with a printed copy of the apology in hand. The officer also informs me that the man's statement *changed* drastically but mine was consistent and that mine made sense where his didn't make sense. *But* the chances were slim that the man would be indicted because there were no witnesses.

I believe this man should not have a CCW because he has demonstrated a propensity toward violence as he has brandished his weapon at me for no reason other than his anger.

I have waited this long to pursue because I thought the 'justice' system was just moving slow but it has become clear that they're not pursuing this further.

Questions: 
1) Does anyone know of official channels I can file a complaint against his CCW? I HAVE googled this extensively but google is not my friend in this instance.

2)Is there a way to file any sort of paperwork with the local DA office with my concerns as to the case (The cop never took a written statement and I'd like to paint a clear picture for the DA) 

3) What would you do

I'm not seeking legal advice;more along the lines of maybe: *""Go to the DA office and look for form #xx and then for the CCW complaint go to this office and look for form #xx""*

I don't have $$ for a lawyer BTW.

Ok, but these guys simply did not know what they were talking about. Numerous comments about liberals, socialists, and the like were said, but I was mentally prepared for those. *What bugged me most is below:*

They started the class by skipping over a great number of the NRA provided slides, they didn't use the nice graphics and slides the NRA provided, instead they covered it with poor descriptions and half ass examples. Lots of 'this', 'those', 'them', etc. Everybody was glassy eyed and I fear almost nobody knew what a double-action or single-action pistol was in the end.

Next, youtube, http://bit.ly/30aLcm), and a woman being handed a large caliber pistol and it going off twice due to recoil and shooting the person behind her (lie, youtube video). *Yes, I believe they said she shot somebody literally in front of them at their training.*

They made us stand up in front of the class and show our stance. I used my regular aggressive isosceles stance

Another thing that made me absolutely furious was the local sheriff had graciously made slides for them to use (which they skipped most of), narrowing of vision, etc), *they had no idea what those where.* ""I don't know what most of those are, but if you practice a little, these things don't happen to you, so I don't know why these are on the slides. These are mostly things that happen after a shootin""

Lastly, they just said ""any federal buildings, the sheriff should give you a list"". And that was it. Class over. I was utterly flabbergasted. 

Tid-bits:

* They didn't know what the castle doctrine was

* They said that all guns without safeties are dangerous. ""Don't buy Glocks

* About the Clackamas, and two people died. You see... that's wrong. I would have put him down.""

While driving at night on a multiple-lane road, and noticed the police car back behind me again. After a few blocks he turned on his lights and pulled me over.

He approached the vehicle and asked me if I knew my license plate lights were both out. (I'm pretty sure he just thought I was acting suspicious and came up with a BS excuse to pull me over.) I informed him that I wasn't aware of that. He asked me for my license and registration, and I told him ""I have a concealed carry permit, and I am carrying tonight."" (My state doesn't require me to inform unless asked.) He asked me where the weapon was, and I informed him that it was in my right hip pocket. (Kel-Tec P32)

At this point he told me that he would require me to surrender my weapon for the duration of the traffic stop and asked me to step out of the car and put my hands against the roof. He frisked me and pulled the gun out of my pocket

This is where I'm not sure about the legality of his actions. Can an officer run a registration check on a firearm with no probable cause? At the end of the traffic stop, I briefly considered telling him ""I don't consent to any searches,"" but realized it would probably just result in him searching my entire car and detaining me for at least another half hour. There was absolutely nothing in the trunk except for two camping chairs, but it was a matter of principle. Had the trunk contained more legally purchased firearms, I'm sure he would have run all their serial numbers through the police database as well.

Reliability: I had 2 FTE's my first box of ammo. And 1 in my second box. After those three failure to ejects, no problems in the last 900 I have shot.

Ammo: takes everything I feed it fine. Remington UMC, and fired a box of 124 +p gold dots without a hiccup and therefore is my carry ammo. The three FTE's that I mentioned earlier was in the Remington UMC, and again, no provls in the last 900 shots.

Trigger: I feel it broke in just a touch. Either it broke in, and the reset is perfect. No complaints at all. Recoil is also extremely light. Not just for a pistol it's size, but for any pistol.

Accuracy: my first magazine was one of the best patterns I had ever fired. Probably really excited. Either way, but could still easily hit a silhouette.

Concealment: I carry it at 4:00 in a theis iwb holster. Just like the super tuck. I can't speak highly enough for Tommy Theis' work, and it is thin enough that it fits in my jeans without needing to get a bigger size.

I paid a full $450 for mine, totally worth it. I really couldn't be happier. My dad is searching for one now, his beretta tomcat he ""loved"" took a giant shit and the frame, not slide, crumbled... I've always hated that gun.

Background: I live in Florida and it is not required to inform and officer you are carrying unless asked and I carry a glock 9mm iwb at 5 o'clock

I was driving to my friends house and came too stop at a stop sign and made a right hand turn. Down the road I see two officers standing outside of their cruisers about an 1/8 of a mile from the stop sign. One was a much older officer and another was a younger officer in his 20s that seemed to be a rookie.

The younger officer steps into the middle of the road and gestured for me to come to a stop. I rolled down my window and stopped. He told me to pull over in front of where their cruisers were parked. I asked if I was being detained. He replies this is a traffic stop. I ask what I did and he said I rolled a stop sign and to move because I'm obstructing traffic.

I pull over and immediately gathered my driver's license, proof of insurance before he walks to my window. I hand the documents and he looks over them and asks if I have an weapons. 

I reply ""Yes""

He asks ""Where is it?""

I reply ""My right hip.""

At this point I see an expression on his face of being nervous and unsettled. He immediately says some code on his radio and walks away from the car and talks to the other older officer. He comes back after about 1 minute and asks me to put my hands in air and step out of the car.  I open the door and move to exit the vehicle when I notice my wallet on my lap. I ask him if I can grab my wallet

He told me to sit back down in my car. The older officer then comes over and tells me they pulled me over for making ""the perfect rolling stop"". He said I didn't blow the stop sign going 15 mph but I nearly came to a complete stop but didn't. He asked if I was a student and I responded I was a first year medical student. He asks and few more questions in a friendly manner and we make small talk for a couple minutes. He then leaves and comes back with his partner and hand me my knife and unloaded gun with slide locked back with the magazine removed. They let me go with a warning and I was on my way.

The whole stop probably took about 15 minutes. I was happy not getting a ticket and felt the whole experience went well. Though I did not enjoy being disarmed I came away with an overall positive experience. I have more respect for my law enforcement officers today than I did yesterday.

I honestly believe the only thing that stopped him from trying was the fact I was standing there and he was sober enough to realize that hitting a person would get him in much more trouble. At this point he got frustrated turned off his keys And threw them into the street. I proceeded to grab them. As soon as I did he climbed out of the Window And began advancing on me with a knife he had had in his pocket. As soon as I saw this I tossed the keys to his feet bit he still continued to come at me.

**Edit #2: They were going 55mph on a 45 mph empty three lane road.** they were **NOT** street racing or exceeding 35 mph in the neighborhood. The speed limit in the neighborhood is **30 mph** hence why my neighbor had no chance to get rid of the Toyota.

So I live in a small area, 1993-1995, next to her. Two Indian (dot on forehead) males roughly 16-17. She tends to drive ""Spirited"", **up to 55 mph in a 45 mph zone** my neighbor and I like to mess around. **up to 55 mph in a 45 mph area when ww pull up next to each other** My car has 1/3rd the horsepower hers does so she'll count to three and then beat me to 55 mph for giggles. Well the little Toyota decided to ""race"" her. **my neighbor and the Toyota were racing, not me**

The road went from two lanes to three lanes. She went **straight** in to the left lane (our turn was a mile down the road on the left) and the Toyota went on the far right lane. **I hung back to watch the ""race"" to 55 mph** She went to go in the turn lane to go into the development **where both me and my neighbor live** and the **Toyota** SLAMMED on their brakes and swerved across two lanes to pull up behind **my neighbor**.

This is when I realize something is horribly wrong.

As she turns left the **Toyota** stayed within 2 feet of her bumper. She takes off

Finally she fakes a left and swerves right. They were so worried about not hitting her, **the passenger ditches the driver and runs into some woods**. The kid rolls down his window, ""Hey fuckin asshole, move your car, I got places to be!"" And I said, ""If you have a problem with my neighbor, you can settle it with me.""

Now

**He stepped out of the car first** (he was about 20 yards away) and said

So I stepped out and he saw the gun **still holstered on my hip** and he raised his hands up (**my hands were nowhere near the gun nor did I motion towards it**) and he said

At this point I was VERY aware of the gun on my hip and my adrenaline was pounding and I said, and followed him out of the development.

Then I went to my neighbors house and **we called the police

WOW! I haven't had that much adrenaline in YEARS!

I know it wasn't a concealed story but this seemed like the best place to post it.

Then throughout the turn into the development the Toyota stayed within a couple feet of her bumper. To get to our side street you have to take a 2 lefts, and then another right. There's only 5 houses on our little side street and I know everyone on our street and he was NOT someone who lived on our street. Their car was old and had rust and none of my neighbors have kids. They're all in their 50s+

The only thing that would have changed if I didn't have a gun, I didn't threaten him with the gun.** When he said, ""Please don't shoot me"" I didn't put the barrel in his mouth, I just said, ""Please go home and leave us alone.""

I was 22 years old having owned my first gun (a Ruger P90 .45) for around 6 months. I had a CCW permit but rarely carried it. Was more for convenience in transporting it. 

I was driving home from night school when I gassed it at an intersection and the light turned red before I got across. I was immediately pulled over by a cop staking out that intersection. 

The gun was underneath my seat and I knew based on the floor design it couldn't have slipped out so I couldn't understand why the officer was acting so strangely. 

He asked me what the vinyl case was in the backseat. I had no idea and began to reach for it. ""DON""T MOVE. DON""T REACH BACK THERE"" he said. I asked him ""What vinyl case? I don't know what you are talking about. I can't help you if I can't reach back there. Do you mean my cassette case?""  ""NO"" he replied. So finally he lets me fish my arm in back of me while looking straight ahead. I was like a 2-3 minute game of hot and cold until finally my hand grabs the vinyl object he is concerned about. 

Whoops !

It was my empty triangular shaped gun case. 

I handed it to him. He shines a flashlight into the obviously empty case ""Is there a gun in here?""  ""No officer"". He asks me if I have a gun in the car which I reply

He asks me to step out and move to the rear of the car. I immediately place my hands on the trunk and remain cool. 

Both officers now search the entire car

I'm a bit confused as to why he thinks I am up to something. ""Nothing"" I replied. He says ""Then what are you doing with a loaded .45 caliber cannon in the car and these books?""

This was early 1992 after the 1st Gulf War and I was heavily into reading about the subject

The 3 books I had in the car along with the gun were:

* It Doesn't Take a Hero - Norman Schwarzkopf's Autobiography
* The Art of War - Sun Tzu
* How to Make War (A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century) - James Dunnigan

1331370902.0,qq4l1,Things to consider before buying a carry gun.,XrayZach,47,4,12,"Thoughts on CCW guns 

My younger brother is in the market for his first carry pistol. I typed up my thoughts for him and thought some people here might be interested too. Sorry it's so long.

 Preface: These are just my opinions about things to consider before purchasing a 
pistol for conceal carry. The actual facts about gun dimensions
caliber performance
online. Every single person is going to have differing opinions about how to 
apply these facts. My main goal is to just show the areas you should consider 
before purchase without getting into my opinions too much. 

 1) The gun must be reliable and must be something you will carry every day. This 
point basically summarizes all the other points to follow. You must be able to 
trust your life to this machine; that means it should always function without 
error
with you every day or there is no point in wasting money on it. A .22 in your 
pocket is infinitely better than a shotgun locked up at home when you need it.  

 2) Size is the next thing to consider. You are looking for a concealable 
firearm...so...it must be concealable. There is a balancing act here
smaller the gun the harder to shoot but easier to carry
enough to hold onto but small enough to stick in your pants. Your body shape is 
going to determine a lot about how much gun you can hide
the harder it gets to make a big gun disappear. Think about the barrel length
long barrels are harder to draw from concealment and harder to hide
inversely
the thicker the gun the less room you have in your pants for your ass. If you 
carry outside the waistband the bigger the gun gets the bigger your gun shaped 
tumor will grow for the world to see. The grip is probably the hardest part of 
the gun to conceal (for me any ways) and the length of the grip must be 
considered. Shorter grips stick out less but hold fewer rounds. 

 3) Next up we have weight. A heavy gun is easier on the hand with recoil and 
easier to shoot accurately but is much more of a drain on you to carry around 
all day. You want a gun light enough it won't pull your pants off
constant bother
becomes. Polymer framed pistols are a great way to save on weight and are 
durable enough to stand the test of time. Weight
me to purchase a different CCW gun
real drain really quick. The rounds in the gun
frames are all going to add weight and you must find the right balance that 
works for you personally.  

 4.) Capacity
business
bullets flew after a gun fight. So carry as many as it takes to make you feel 
safe. If you feel secure with five rounds in a snubby
saying goes
Ideally
every person. The average gunfight is often said to be less than three rounds 
fired total
rounds from you?  Does your gun use single or double stack mags? Single mags are 
slimmer and will be easier to carry a second one if you want but hold less 
rounds. Every situation is different and you can't plan for all of them so again 
carry what makes you feel safe and what you will actually carry. 

 5) Caliber
opinions on this than anything else hands down. I'm going to keep it simply 
here. No rimfire
will need and even expensive rimfire loads have a higher rate of failure than 
centerfire loads. There is also no reason to carry a .32 caliber
anyone that makes a .32 will make the exact same gun (weigh and size) in .380 
also
After that all I will say is the bigger the bullet the more energy you will have 
leaving the barrel but you will either lose capacity or have to carry a bigger 
gun. Look up penetration and energy charts for the calibers you are interested 
in and decide what works for you. When it comes down to it
the most important thing. Unless you carry a pocket RPG you have to hit vitals 
before caliber is going to make a difference.  

 6) Buy quality
better than that brand but this is not the place to cheap out. In the end the 
bullet does all the work
bullet can do its job. Watch videos on YouTube and look at penetration and 
expansion test charts and decide what brand you want
functions IN YOUR FIREARM. You should practice with the same weight bullet you 
plan to carry but make sure you also put a few boxes of carry ammo through your 
gun to test function and make sure point of aim is the same as your practice 
stuff. Also remember to rotate your ammo every now and then. 

 7) What type of holster and where on your body will you carry? If you are dead 
set on a certain style holster make sure they make it for the firearm you are 
looking to purchase. Also if you are buying a new model gun (not recommended for 
a carry gun) holsters can be hard to find for awhile. Practice drawing and 
carrying in different locations on your body and from different positions
standing, crouching ect. Find what 
is most comfortable and has the best access and concealment for you. There is no 
right answer on carry method
easy to get to in a hurry. I recommend always carrying in the same position so 
you never have to think about where the gun is. In a stress situation your brain 
shuts down and you need to be able to do things w/o too much thought. PRACTICE 
DRAWING over and over until it becomes instinct and practice with different 
types of clothing. If you have access to different size handguns and holsters 
(family or friends or other guns in your personal collection) try carrying 
different size guns around the house for a few hours in different positions on 
your body, stretch and walk around to 
see what you can comfortably conceal. 

 8) What features do you want on the gun? External safety
slim sights, and trigger pull and weight 
are all things to consider. Every gun is different and there are a lot of 
options out there. There are pluses and minuses for everything on the list
a model gun that you like. Gun stores love your money and most will be happy to 
let you play with all the guns you want until you find what suits your needs. 

 9) Cost. This is not the time to buy a high point
has a lifetime warranty
rifle jams up you might miss the deer
can may live another day
are in a serious world of hurt. Buy a quality gun with a solid reputation
is why I said earlier not to buy a brand new model
reviews out there to judge the gun by and many first runs have issues that still 
need to be worked out. If you want to save money here then don't get a fancy 
engraved finish with gold plating
quality functioning weapon.  

 10) All things considered you must like the final product. If you don't like the 
gun
there. Some things can't be summed up with words and if the gun just doesn't do 
it for you personally

 A few final thoughts to consider before you start to carry a weapon. First
everything for a CCW gun is a compromise
up in function and vise versa. You need to remember that you are not buying a 
combat weapon
death situation when you have no other options. You are not a badass because you 
have a gun
of the scene
finally you have to decide wether you are capable of taking a human life if you 
have to. That's not a fun question and one I hope you never have to actually use 
the answer on
if you are willing to end someone's life to continue yours. ",,t5_2s4mc,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/qq4l1/things_to_consider_before_buying_a_carry_gun/

I found a few places that offered after market grip options, use the [SAF Link](http://www.saf.org/amazon/). I traced the design of the grip from the pistol onto paper, then onto the griptape and cut with an old pair of scissors (griptape, sandpaper, etc will fuck up your scissors over time).

I've been quite happy with the end result. Due to the contour of the pistol, so at the beginning it would scratch me slightly, especially when turning around while seated. After wearing and using it a bit, the extreme grit seems to have subsided and I no longer notice it. The grip has increased by magnitude and it feels great in my hand.

He does not come from a family that has had guns and I have known he isn't exactly fond of them for a long time before we were close so I have never mentioned guns or the fact that I CCW to him at all.  He is a great guy but I didn't want to worry about what he would think about having guns all over the house.

Cutting to the chase

We were adjusting the legs of my desk to lower it since I've been having some back problems and he was giving me a hand.  I totally forgot that my gun could fall out if you bang around on that desk hard enough and so I didn't even think about.  While we were setting the desk back in place it sure enough fell out onto the desk.

He said ""whoa what was tha....."" and looked at me a little funny.  I just said ""That's my .45"" and grinned a little.  I felt terrible but he seemed a little bit intrigued actually because he knows me pretty well.

Of course his next question was ""is it loaded?"" to which I responded ""Oh yeah.  Always.""  

I asked if he wanted to see it and he did not.  I just completely dropped it there and apologized because I felt terrible.  After putting all my stuff back on the desk I unloaded it and left it on the desk with the slide racked and let him know he could look at it whenever he wanted.  He went in and seemed to be really intrigued by not only the gun but the fact that I had one loaded all the time.

I explained a few things and later that evening he actually said ""I want a gun now"".

It's amazing what a little knowledge and experience can do for someone.

I just wanted to share.  Sorry for the novel.

1367371497.0,1dgatu,Tell me why I shouldn't get a shoulder holster.,VanRitz,42,3,49,"I am turning 21 very soon and am ready to start carrying. The firearm I plan to be carrying will be roughly the size of a Glock 19 for those wondering. I know shoulder holsters often get shit on unless you are an extra in a TV crime drama

- I am tall and slim (6'2"" 165) and tend to wear tailored, which discourages me from getting a holster located on my waist. The only time I have outerwear that is long enough to my rear end is when I am wearing a suit jacket, sports coat, or an actual foul weather coat. It seems that OWB holsters would almost always be visible, and that IWB holsters would not pair well with my clothing choices either. However, I am almost always wearing an unbuttoned outer layer (often pretty short in length, like a classic [levis trucker jacket](http://images.askmen.com/fashion/apparel/1248984763_levis-trucker-jacket_1.jpg)) that would be able to easily conceal a shoulder holster.

- For my career, etc.

- Most importantly

But seriously. Is my thought process correct here? I don't really have much interest in an ankle holster or anything else semi-unusual. Let me know what y'all think.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback so far. Some points that people have brought up include:

- Retention problems with others having access to your weapon

- Not being able to draw at the range

- Not as secure

- You can mount a holster in the vehicle when driving if necessary

- Anything shoulder holsters can do

Others were over $50. Alien started at around $36 (shipping). More if you wanted black leather. But they have a store also on eBay.

Not to mention the wait times. Some online were at 2 weeks

Quality. It's great...for $36. But I also wasn't expecting perfection for that price. The Kydex is very nice, is the extra spacers they give you. They SUCK. They should either give you color coded spacers, or a length of tube and a razor blade so you can cut to it length. Many of mine were at different sizes.

Concealment is very nice. No real problems from it. The grip in the holster for me is nice and snug. You can adjust it to your liking

 I've found myself at a personal dilemma as to when it would be appropriate or not to carry. Keep in mind I live in PA, even if I was slightly intoxicated, if shit hit the fan, I would rather have the choice to defend myself, drunk or not.  I feel like it is okay to carry when I am going to be driving, staying under the legal limit. I also have chosen not to carry on ""nights out"" when I know I am going to be getting shit faced, partying hard. The dilemma is the middle ground, I am going out with some friends to watch the basketball game. I'll probably have too much to drink to drive (I'm getting a ride) but I have work tomorrow so I won't be reckless. Clearly based on this ramble,,
1362968297.0,1a23f6,Why I Oppose Universal Background Checks and Current Regs on Transporting Handguns Across State Lines,mnbookman,47,10,13,"I am now married to a wonderful woman who, something changed.

She worked on the weekends as a leasing agent in a nice apartment complex, she made eye contact with a maintenance man who figured out she was scared, who got one of the resident police officers. That officer came in and waited as though he was in line. My now-wife thanks him, and they thought everything was fine.

Until the next weekend, ""Where were you this week? I checked every day and you weren't here!"" No one in the office during the week had seen him, so it was obvious the guy was doing very discreet recon, and that he is the kind of person that for me goes immediately into ""potential threat mode.""

I was on a plane out of here that night with several declared firearms. She could not immediately buy a handgun in NC due to the waiting period

I spent the next day training her how to safely and effectively use a handgun

Which brings me to why I oppose universal background checks and the current regulations on transporting handguns across state lines: right now, and she found herself with a guy who was behaving like a stalker. Universal background checks, even with family waivers, would have made me giving her a gun illegal. Had I wanted to give her a handgun, it would have been illegal under *current Federal Law.* The whole thing is bogus.

Oh, the property owner mentioned he found out the guy had been arrested for some type of assault shortly after the no trespass - an assault against a woman. My wife didn't ask more, so I don't know if that was a pseudonym for rape, robbery, or what.

I looked at a bunch of different companies and could not find one that was made for my gun. So I decided I would spend the 90 bucks on tools and supplies to make my own. Now when I need a holster I can just make one.

 Now I know it is not perfect but it works. I left a little too much room in the pocket and didn't have a perfect design. I also put the dye on a little streaky but I think it turned out great and matches the grips well. I had a blast making it and will be making more.

# **Five Rules for Concealed Carry**

**1\.  YOUR CONCEALED HANDGUN IS FOR PROTECTION OF LIFE ONLY.** Draw it solely in preparation to protect yourself or an innocent third party from the wrongful and life-threatening criminal actions of another.

**2\.  KNOW EXACTLY WHEN YOU CAN USE YOUR GUN.** A criminal adversary must have

&gt; A) The ability to inflict serious bodily injury (he is armed or reasonably appears to be armed with a deadly weapon)

&gt; B) The opportunity to inflict serious bodily harm (he is physically positioned to harm you with his weapon)

&gt; C) His intent (hostile actions or words) indicates that he means to place you in jeopardy -- to do you serious or fatal physical harm.

When all three of these attack potential elements are in place simultaneously

**3\.  IF YOU CAN RUN AWAY -- RUN!** Just because you’re armed doesn’t necessarily mean you must confront a bad guy at gunpoint. Develop your ""situation awareness"" skills so you can be alert to detect and avoid trouble altogether. Keep in mind that if you successfully evade a potential confrontation, criminal liability and/or financial ruin from civil lawsuit. Flee if you can, fight only as a last resort.

**4\.  DISPLAY YOUR GUN, regardless of how unintentional or innocent or justified the situation might seem. Choose a method of carry that reliably keeps your gun hidden from public view at all times.

You have no control over how a stranger will react to seeing (or learning about) your concealed handgun. He or she might become alarmed and report you to police as ""a man or woman with a gun."" Depending on his or her feelings about firearms

Before you expose your gun in public, and is actively seeking the opportunity to do you great harm.

**5\.  DON’T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF YOU.** If, never mention, imply or exhibit your gun for the purpose of intimidation or one-upmanship. You’ll simply make a bad situation worse -- for yourself (see rule #4).",,False,,t5_2s4mc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/t1pxy/came_across_this_list_via_link_on_rguns_of/
1333509583.0,rsb2k,My incident from this weekend. Please help me analyze it. ,cabrilo,44,10,77,"This weekend I took my 3 year old son to visit his aunt and cousin in California. Guess what I could not take along. 

On Saturday after lunch we were walking around the neighborhood with the kids. She lives in a great neighborhood (Burlingame - just outside of San Francisco). We were just about done with the walk and my sister and her kid walked into the house. My son was poking some mud with a stick and I was in no hurry so I was just watching him. 

All of a sudden I see a young white guy in a corner of my eye and he does not belong around. His head is shaved he is wearing shorts and t-shirt (it was cold and rainy) and the shorts was basically around his ankles. He is walking literally in the middle of the road (not much traffic at all) and he has a dog that is running off leash on the sidewalk. I then notice that the dog is a giant pit bull with a chain consisting of 3 huge links. The dog sprints for my son. My first instinct is to lift my son up, and my mind is going full speed on how to stop him. The best I came up in the moment is to lift the dog by the chain. A moment before I was to do this the dog takes off in other direction. 

At this point the owner is walking past me with a gangster swagger. I yell out ""what the fuck"" and try to make an eye contact with him. He looks into the sky the whole time and while holding a leash across his neck he flips me two birds while slowly walking by. 

First of all - fuck carry restrictions and irresponsible pit bull owners. 

If we were at home I feel confident that I would have drawn at the dog. I probably would have held it on his head and waited to see what he does. But I think I should have just shot the dog. Had I waited and he attacked it would be hard to shot him without hitting my son.

I have a fit 75 lb dog

Since when I ordered my Crossbreed I also ordered a Old Faithful for my Glock 21 which arrived two weeks after I ordered it.  I wanted to share some initial impressions and points to any of you looking at which of these two holster companies to go with.  First of

Some considerations about my order:

* I ordered the Crossbreed in Horsehide and the Old Faithful didn't have that option
* My Old Faithful came shaped
* I've worn the Old Faithful for three weeks now

Now on to the fun stuff:

On leather:

Old Faithful is significantly thicker than Crossbreed, so that may account for some of the thickness difference.  It's also worth noting that Old Faithful gives you a larger leather area around the weapon.

On Kydex:

Old Faithful covers from the barrel up to above the trigger, etc.

On Clips:

The Crossbreed clips are fantastic

On Hardware:

Crossbreed rivets the Kydex to the leather

On Gun Retention:

Crossbreed is not adjustable

Both are excellent holsters, this is all about personal preference, use what works, what you feel comfortable with.

Disclaimer: This was my first and only visit to an Airsoft arena. My experience may be very different from yours. I'm only writing this to give you my perspective (and to soothe my bruised ego). Since I'm an ex-military CCWer who takes weapons very

This past weekend I visited the [SAS Black Ops](http://www.sasblackops.com/) arena in Marietta

After eating a late breakfast at the Cracker Barrel (Grandma's Sampler, some with body armor, were waiting for the next match. Most of the kids had custom goggles and masks, flashlights, and backup weapons. Shit.

While we drew our weapons, I noted a few things about the other customers. First, muzzle sweep was rampant; even the armorer would casually point weapons in the general direction of the customers and pull the trigger to test the motor's action. Granted, the weapon had a sock over the muzzle, but...

Second, watching everyone (my friends included) walk around with their finger on the trigger, sweeping everyone in the room.

Lastly

When we moved to the ""briefing room"" to get ready for a match, and explained the rules of the game. The Yellow Team wore a yellow scarf to differentiate themselves. We started off with a deathmatch where you're allowed to respawn twice; upon your third ""death"" you had to return to the team's respawn point and wait for the match to end. Subsequent games involved capturing flags, raising flags, finding a detonator for a nuke, etc.

Upon entering the arena, pretty much eliminating the possibility for finding a truly defensible position. The building were never more than ten or fifteen feet apart, though there were some sight lines (streets, alleys) than ran for 50 feet or more. There was a scale model of the arena in the building's lobby, but I didn't have the time to memorize it.

Each team went to their designated building at opposite corners of the arena

I should point out that the arena was very well-lit. However, strategically placed to blind people looking around some corners and to cast long shadows around others. You see, this 27,000 sq ft arena ""specializes in simulated Night Ops.""

So, surrounded by teenagers who knew the layout better than I did, were better equipped, and had actually done this before. Double shit.

Everyone took off in different directions

About thirty seconds later I took my first hit

I moved back to our building and ""respawned."" A couple of minutes later I was creeping through a building when a kid jumps through the doorway and yells ""Surrender!"" Honestly

Now, the rental gun I was using had no real *snap* to the fire selector, so it moved easily from semi to automatic. So... I guess I shot him about three or four or five times. From a distance of about three feet. We got chewed out by the range officer at the next briefing. It turns out I wasn't the only one to do something like that.

I ended up being the last guy out on our team, hid, and waited for someone to come along that I could ambush. It didn't take long for some kamikaze kids to take me out. Which brings me to my biggest gripe about the whole outing...

My overall impression of the experience is that it's designed to be a LARPing version of Call of Duty. None of the kids seemed to care about getting shot; they just run off and respawn.

I knew that if I called the police that it would take a while for them to get there and since I was working for their family it might effect me completing my work and getting paid.

I felt that since I was carrying a firearm that I may have to employ deadly force if confronted by this young man.  By standing by and waiting to what happened I felt that I would not make the situation worse. I figured it I got involved the young man might threaten me with the bat.

The guys came to the back door and when he opened it they smashed his face with a baseball bat a few times, ran in and pulled the register and grabbed a bunch of cigarettes.

I turn on a few of the lights and make sure the camera feeds are getting a decent picture

He did had a uniform, but I know how these things could go down, so I ask him if he's got a work ID or something to verify. He tells me he comes here all the time in the morning for the owner (who he mentioned by name - though that wouldn't be hard to discern if you lived in/near the neighborhood)



I tell him I'm going to open the door, but was fortunate to be greeted just by the exterminator.

So the first thing I'd like to say is how proud I am of my wife. She won't read this

If you come to these threads giddy and white knuckled for stories of people getting proned out by police and such..you'll be utterly disappointed.

We went grocery shopping at Giant Food Store in Coopersburg Pennsylvania this afternoon. It was myself, if that matters, since allegedly a customer was 'afraid' of a clean cut and relatively nicely dressed man walking around the store loading groceries with his wife and kids.

There was a call for security on the PA system and shortly after I was approached by the assistant store manager. Jerry advised me that I may not have a firearm in the store and it needs to be put in my vehicle. I was clearly compliant, yet hesitation, I suggested an unattended firearm in a vehicle would be rather unsafe and asked if I could cover it while I remain in the store. No, of course, was Jerry's answer. I secured it in the car and came back inside.

Jerry was, and according to my wife, he made her feel ""like a criminal"".

I met with the store manager (Chris) upon arriving inside, he confirmed it is. I questioned when this became effective and he answered ""about six months ago"". He stated something to the effect of how Giant Food Stores wants their customers to feel safe and this is why the corporate decision was made to prohibit firearms (unless you're law enforcement ). It was clear this was not his personal decision, but he was my current point of contact with the company and I asked if I could provide some feedback about what he's told me.

-There aren't many
-I have been shopping with Giant for over a decade
-Firearm owners don't always agree on everything, and I'd personally be voting with my money (or lack thereof) by abandoning the cart full of groceries that I'd already accumulated.  
-The events I experienced will most certainly be shared with my fellow firearm owners.

Chris didn't mind if I abandoned the groceries and he seemed like a stand up guy. He mentioned that he's a firearm owner himself

I concluded my business with Chris, historically (from 1999-2012) as anti as they come, refusing to pay for groceries because of Giant's policy. Warmed my heart.

Do any of you carry a trauma kit as an EDC item

If you carry one

* which one
* what sort of training did you get on using it?

If you considered carrying one but decided against it

* Was it liability?  Or that you didn't think it would be needed given your circumstances (fast LE or EMT response time)?

Do any of you carry a decompression needle?  If so, with the proper training of course?  Some people seems to have the opinion that even if they wouldn't use it themselves, they are betting that a bystander with the proper training could use it in case the bystander isn't carrying one themselves (i.e. they are off duty but don't carry one).

**Background**

There's a lot of history with such kits in the military and those who serve domestically (law enforcement

* 60%: extremity hemorrhaging
* 33%: tension pneumothorax
* 6: airway obstruction

Such kits are labeled as ""TCCC Compliant.""

As is often the case

**Kit Components**

What follows seems to be the essential components of a pocket trauma kit (treat extremity hemorrhaging and possibly tension pneumothorax with makeshift occlusive dressing using plastic packaging):

* tourniquet - SWAT-Tourniquet seems perfect for this purpose
* hemostatic agent - QuikClot or CELOX Z-Fold Gauze
* pressure bandage - 4"" Israeli Bandage seems to be the go-to pressure bandage
* good quality nitrile gloves
* some kind of blade to serve as trauma shears - pocket knives with rescue features such as [Benchmade 915 Traige](http://www.benchmade.com/products/915) or a dedicated safety cutter tool such as [Benchmade 7 Safety Cutter](http://www.benchmade.com/products/7)

I have a full size pistol that I kept in the truck.  I always told myself I would carry it if I ever needed it.  Stupid of course.  I found myself in a situation outside a pawnshop in a shitty part of Tampa

I wanted to get a Glock 26 for the cheap ammo and reliability but I couldn't see myself realistically carrying even that small of a gun.  I ended up settling on the LCP with a pocket holster.  Problem solved.  I can slip it into my front pocket on the way out the door just like it's a cell phone or wallet.  It's actually thinner than my wallet

I carried with an empty chamber for a couple of days just to get the feel of the gun

Surprisingly accurate to.  I made a helluva lot of 3-4"" groups at 7 yards drawing and firing in at a self defense kind of speed.  2-3"" at a more reasonable pace.  The web of my hand did get a little tender after a box of 50 though.  

Anyone that's looking for a simple and inexpensive carry gun would do well to stick this one on their list.  No, and it won't stop a charging grizzly with it's .380.  It is sitting right there in my pocket when it's needed though, while my full size is probably still stuck in my truck.

What holster do you use and in what position? 

Do you have night sights? (I really enjoy having them on a carry weapon so they're one of my must have items) 

Do you use a laser? 

Do you use the manual safety or leave it in the off position? (I think the safety is a little too small to easily deactivate under duress and I have a disciplined trigger finger so I'd rather just not have the safety)

&gt;First of all
&gt;
&gt;On occasion
&gt;Last night
&gt;I was sitting next to a buddy and watching some Olympic reruns.
&gt;There were a total of 10 people in the tavern (8 men and 2 women)
&gt;
&gt;A black guy (young - about 20 or so) walked in and sat down about 15 feet away by himself at a table.
&gt;I didn't think anything of it.
&gt;I live in a safe neighborhood and only read about shit that happens in unsafe cities.
&gt;I turned my eyes back to the TV and continued watching a 15 year old American girl swimmer kick ass.
&gt;
&gt;The waitress asked the black guy what he wanted to drink.
&gt;He replied something (I didn't hear what he said).
&gt;The waitress asked for an ID.
&gt;He said he didn't have one.
&gt;He walked up to the bar right beside me and told the waitress he would give his birth date.
&gt;Again the waitress asked for an ID.
&gt;
&gt;Now keep in mind that I wasn't watching him.  
&gt;I was watching TV. 
&gt;I am in a safe neighborhood.
&gt;I could give a crap less that the guy didn't have an ID.
&gt;
&gt;Big Fucking Mistake.
&gt;
&gt;Next thing I know
&gt;
&gt;I immediately got up and saw the black fucking asshole running out the front door.
&gt;I got up and chased after him (everyone else in the bar was sort of in a WTF just happened mode).
&gt;Once I got to the door (dude
&gt;I screamed every racial slur I could think of to lure him back in the bar (the seven other guys are quite large - one even played for Iowa State)
&gt;He turned to look at me but continued to run off. Chicken shit.
&gt;
&gt;Cops were called (three cars were there in 2 minutes) and a police report made.
&gt;I couldn't identify him even if my life depended on it but three people in the bar gave very detailed descriptions.
&gt;Cops looked for him and came back empty handed.
&gt;(Confirms the basic role of a law enforcement officer as a ""crime historian"" and not as a ""crime preventer""...).
&gt;
&gt;Basically
&gt;(You can google ""knockout game""...)
&gt;
&gt;The intent is to hit an unsuspecting innocent person in the temple to knock them out.
&gt;Fortunately for me
&gt;His ride was probably waiting up the street to take themselves back to hood-ville.
&gt;
&gt;**This periodically happens even in St. Charles county.**
&gt;**You just don't hear about it.**
&gt;**I am making sure you hear about it now.**
&gt;**It happened to me.**
&gt;**Spread the word.**
&gt;
&gt;I thought about this a lot this morning and it could have ended up a lot worse.
&gt;A hell of a lot worse considering what happened in Colorado a couple of weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;No matter what kind of community you are in (safe or not)
&gt;If anything doesn't seem right
&gt;
&gt;Watch your back.

I literally spent most of the past few days handling and shooting different firearms. I handled almost every one of the 9 mm's on my list and also a bunch of 380's. I also shot 9mm's .40's

I ended up purchasing a Smith and Wesson Shield for $385. Awesome gun and I felt like an awesome price. I got it from a small town mom and pop dealer that I think I will now be purchasing all of my firearms from. They were so helpful and ended up staying late to get me my firearm. Here is the url to their website: http://barneyoutdooroutfitters.com

I will now give my impressions of the 9 mm's I handled:

Kahr CM9- Simple, so it was #2 on my list.

Ruger LC9- Holy crap! People were not kidding when they said there are a lot of safeties on this gun! While I was holding it a guy said to me ""Well

Smith and Wesson M&amp;P9 Shield- I love the intuitive design slim profile and large sights. As soon as I bought it I went to a range and put 25 rounds through it before cleaning or doing anything. It shot awesome and didn't have a single misfeed or malfunction. I could go on and on about it, and how it fit in my hand.

Taurus PT709 Slim- I also liked how this one felt in my hand, but it appears that Taurus is on the right track. I think this was my #3 choice.

1370968296.0,1g4olm,Last night was the first time I truly wanted to be armed,swinebone,49,22,80,"I have been wanting a handgun and a concealed carry permit for about a year

I was walking out of a local grocery store with a female friend when we observed two vehicles pull up in the fire lane. The one in the rear was following very closely and bumped the one in the front. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I knew that this was something more than your run-of-the-mill fender bender. Sure enough

Both drivers leapt out of their vehicles and began yelling at each other. The driver of the rear vehicle, the male driver of the lead vehicle clocked her on the side of the head hard enough so that her head bounced off of his rear window.

All of this occurred within seconds and my friend and I were less than five feet away from them. Neither the woman or the man paid that much attention to us

My friend can have a fiery temper and I knew that her instinct was to step in and try to protect the woman. As quickly as I could, and walked with her towards my car. I felt exposed and unprotected in the open parking lot. As soon as we got into my car and I locked the doors we were on the line with 911.

I wouldn't have done anything differently if I would have been carrying, my only options were my fists or my EDC knife I was carrying. I knew neither were great options.

The man and the woman began to leave the area while we were on the line with 911 dispatch. I figure it had to be some sort of domestic dispute

When we got back to her apartment, but it scares me to think that she could have sacrificed her personal safety and stepped into the unknown like that if I hadn't had been there.

Even though my adrenaline has long since worn off, but now I honestly just feel resolved to not feel defenseless ever again.

I graduated graduate school in May and am currently looking for full-time employment, and a quality holster. I think I've considered it a passing fancy or a hobby for far too long.

EDIT: Will be picking up a CCW permit, *and* some good training. Thanks for reminding me /u/BerntPickle.

* Joann's

Definitely didn't plan on going all of those places on my first day carrying. Eventually my gun just disappeared after a couple of hours and I was only aware of it while driving. My holster is a generic/cheap two clip kydex type that seems so popular and is tuckable (more on that in a minute) and worked fine with my shirt untucked. It's a little bulky so I purchased a leather

Here's my problem: I tuck in my shirts for work (business casual) and church. I can't seem to make either of these holsters work while tucked in. No matter what I did the shirt looked sloppy, I can't dress myself.**

I know what you're probably thinking... get a quality holster. And you're right, but what do I know compared to y'all that have carried for years.

Get a cover garment? Not in the south in the summer

If you haven't noticed my flair, I can carry fine when my shirt isn't tucked in. But the two places I tuck in for (and are the main reasons why I got my enhanced carry permit - church and college where I work) I can't carry in because I look like a 6 year old who dressed himself. I'm seriously considering a belly band or shoulder holster for tuck in occasions. Pocket carry is out of the question due to most of my pockets not being big enough for my gun.

Any suggestions?

He asked the same questions they all do but his tone was just a bit condescending for so early in the morning. I thought about being a dick back and giving him the am I legally required to answer this question? That really isn't my style though and I didn't have the mental state to try and pull that off so I just said ""yeah I am running a bit late and thought I would try to make the light"" as I gave him the guilty awkward smile.


He continued to be a bit stand offish as he asked for my license and registration.

He responded completely different got patient and then started to chat a bit as I was still fumbling through car repair receipts and expired registrations. I was floored how much his demeanor had changed and when I finally got the good registration out he gave my CC license back and gave me a ""ok sit tight for a sec"" as he went back to the cruiser but said it in a real casual manner like you would tell your buddy to sit tight for a sec as you got up to get more beers.


Still got a ticket but I have never got away in that county without one and all the cops in that county specifically have been pricks and god help you if you get one of their female officers.

He never even asked if I was carrying, and I was with my XDm IWB and I had my G26 BUG in my EDC bag, and he didn't even seem to care.

Anyway, I asked the security guard what happened and he said that someone from the clinic next door stabbed another rehab patient in the neck with a knife. He said it happened while he was out to lunch, which would've been about exactly the time I would have arrived at work if not for my appointment. Needless to say, witnessing a knife-wielding drug addict stabbing people in the neck would have been a good time to have a weapon to defend myself.

1329666586.0,pwhom,Case Study - What a CCW Permit Holder Should've Done in This Situation?,what-the-frack,29,2,58,"Yesterday

What I want to ask CCWdit is what could've/should've been done

The scenario - I was at work yesterday. I was traveling in a van with 8 students (age 15-18 kids). I was the only adult/chaperone on this leg of the trip. Because I was driving a vehicle that I would have to get out in gun free school zones

Anyway, ect.  I'm embarrassed my students have to see this, and wish it wasn't happening but when I get back to the van it's just yelling. 

While waiting on the last student the male goes around to the driver side where a female is sitting and starts punching the female in the face.  I immediately grab my phone and dial 911. Because we're in rural America at a random truck stop by the interstate 911 literally takes 3-5 minutes of transfers to get an operator. Once the operator gets my location she has to transfer me to the state police because I'm out of her area. 

During this time the male has charged the female 3-5 more times punching her visibly in the face multiple times each charge.  He stops and yells at her between charges.  Also during this time the female has called a family member or friend who has brought a minivan to pick the female and 3 children up. One of the children is in a baby carrier car seat. Also during this time I saw at least 8 other people videoing the event or calling the cops. There was one tiny lady in her 50s visibly yelling at the male to leave the female alone and leave the premises - she was 60 yards away or more. The male flipped her the middle finger and went on about his assault. After that the male appeared to be aware of the attention and yelled to the female being assaulted that he dared anyone to try to intervene. Implying he would hurt them too. 

Because of his threats I knew he was either armed or was used to violence directed at him. Along this time one of his ""home boys"" showed up and tried to calm him, and a baggy hoodie with skate shoes. 

After finally getting through to the state police dispatch the dispatcher took my description of the scene, the plates from his vehicle, and assured me state police were en route. I also let the dispatcher know the female now had someone getting her away from the scene.  The female was crying, was bruised and was very shaken up. I left at that point to get my students away from anything else that could go bad in the event he came back out. There were plenty of witnesses, and many who were closer to the scene than myself.  Since my students care was entrusted to me that was my primary responsibility at that time. 

Also, we had some great discussions about the right way men and women should love and interact with each other.  This included how no matter what, violence is not love, how women who get beat up emotionally or physically deserve better, and how men who are violent deserve no second chances and that was the only good thing that came from this. 

My thoughts - I tried to just state facts above, and I immediately thought he would have either a gun or knife on him. He was obviously violent, and couldn't be controlled with social stigma like shame or the like. In the end there were also 2 of him because his buddy showed up and had this posture of ""I've got your back.""

In this situation where I was primarily responsible for 8 underage students I couldn't have responded.  If something would've happened to me the student would be unsupervised in a seemingly dangerous place. I would have been fired and possibly sued for neglecting these students. 

But

Having not taken my CCW class yet, and I am even more ashamed that I was not able to intervene.  I feel sorry for the female in that situation that she had to get hit in the face 15 or more times while all I could do was watch while waiting for a 911 operator to pick up. I feel ashamed that those 3 kids had to watch their mother get assaulted by a violent man while no one intervened.  I feel ashamed of all the people there who sat on their phones and watched something that was wrong, both morally and legally go on without actively trying to stop it. But I understand why no one intervened. The male was violent and could have been armed, and if no one there was also armed then they could have been killed trying to do the right thing. 

Response time for you the reader - So CCWdit, but I don't want to feel like this ever again. I believe this one encounter has changed my life, and I feel horrible that no one was able to help.  I feel like everyone in that parking lot was responsible for what was going on, and we're all guilty of being too afraid to do anything.  I think if more people we're armed this man's behavior would have be different; probably from the beginning because he wouldn't have been dumb enough to do this in public because an armed group would have stopped him, but definitely once 1 or 2 or 3 armed private citizens intervened once he displayed these actions in public. In an ideal world, he should have been laying on the ground waiting to be arrested while the female and her children were being helped by the rest of us. 

His behavior was inexcusable

tl;dr (I know it was really long, etc. against a seemingly helpless female in a public place. No one really responded except to call the police. I believe it was because the assailant looked armed and people were afraid - how would you have responded as a CCW permit holder or even as an unarmed private citizen?",,False,,t5_2s4mc,False,,

Well

I called my contact back yesterday to let him know I could find another reference

He told me I have to wait one year before I'm allowed to apply for a CPL. I asked why, but that it could and should. 

I don't know what state or Federal law he's referencing when he says these things... there's no one year limit from the last time you smoked or had an MMMP card... there's no Federal law I know of that says ""if you smoked in the last year..."", that any firearms I had should really be seized... but that that wouldn't happen.

I can't help but feel a bit weird about that conversation. I have since reached out to the State Attorney General's office, and I'm not happy about it. I'm *not* saying I think my contact is fucking with me. He said he would talk to his boss and get back to me, and I think the things he's telling me are the things he's being told. Maybe I'm being naive, but that's what I believe at this time. 

I will continue to provide updates as I hear back from those I've reached out to

You are **truly** appreciated. 

**EDIT --** Wow, the position is held that just *having* a card is evidence of smoking dope and claim that you can't use or possess firearms from 12 months since your last use. *This* part is not law, it's just their current opinion.

1360534773.0,189pix,Range Reports - Beretta Nano &amp; Beretta PX4 Sub-Compact 9MM,NeedlessKane,29,6,16,"So this past week I went a little nuts and picked up two new Berettas - both of which I've been wanting for a while.  The intent was to pick up something that my fiancee would enjoy shooting as well as carrying with her. Whichever one she liked the best

Nano:
Out of the box it has a really good feel. Fit and finish are superb - no rattles

 Since the gun is DAO the trigger pull is a little stiff - ~8lbs but very very crisp. There is no creep and it breaks very nicely.  The recoil is VERY controllable
I shot 50 rounds in total all with FMJ PMC Bronze 115gr and Monarch FMJ 115gr. I had one FTF on the first magazine, etc.  The lack of external safety was something that took a little bit for my fiancee to accept. We attempted to pull the trigger by only grabbing the sides of the trigger, etc and it was a no go. The entire trigger mechanism must be pulled back in order to make it fire.

Overall - a great shooter

Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact 9mm:
I already own the PX4 Compact in .40 and I've been very eager to see what the Sub-Compact had to offer.   Like my Compact

In terms of shooting - it ran like a dream.  The added weight (~26oz vs ~19oz for the Nano) definitely helped with lining shots up again and again.  The double action first shot is quite a long pull - longer than the Nano.  The single action shots have some trigger take-up before hitting resistance, after that no more issues.

In terms of a solid CC weapon - the Nano is hard to beat. The snag-free design

The Sub-Compact's biggest issue is its size - The damn thing is thick and heavy

Overall - Both great platforms

As a first CCW

Black English Bridle Leather. Black Kydex. For my CZ75B. It took about twenty minutes to assemble because I was playing with the various tension, washer and t-joint holes. So basically a hammer and the included wrench is what you need.

I'm wearing it right now to break it in and it is actually more comfortable that I expected. The weight on my 5 o'clock position is the only thing I notice about wear it. The leather sandwiched between a t-shirt and zipper fleece hoodie feels very comforting.

Clint Smith said that carrying should be more comforting than comfortable, move around and tilt without the gun moving or feeling any different.

1347290959.0,znmtu,Thoughts on my recent CCW training,Expressman,27,3,35,"Yesterday I took the 8-hour course required by the state of Michigan for CCW (CPL here

Anyway

I was initially worried the whole class would be like Drivers Ed and pretty much be 8 hours of scared-straight threats. It turned out to be anything but. Since MI has castle doctrine and no duty to retreat

The class itself was very diverse. 24 people, from barely 21 year olds to a white haired little old lady. Both the men and women seemed to be financially diverse also, from the ""redneck"" types to the ""blue bloods"". All were there.

It was interesting because, lawyering up, and all that. Also, even though the cop had investigated hundreds of homicides, he was adamant in teaching us not to talk to the cops, which I already knew but it was good to hear right from a homicide cop.

One of the students was obviously a boy from da-hood, MI law is very much on the side of the victim.

Of course we watched some NRA videos on the topic. That was... interesting. My main take-away from them is I'm really happy MI does not require you to warn and announce.

All in all, (which I am already taking advantage of), so hopefully they will.

All in all it was a great experience. I'm very much inclined to take their tactical course this winter sometime. Now it's time to put in the paperwork

So here's how it may actually go for you.

You'll probably get your license in the mail.  ""WOW

It's alright to be excited

You've trained for this, let's do it!  You slip your gun into your holster.  It fits firmly and you know how it acts because you've worn it around the house for what seems like the longest time.  As you're about ready to head out of the door you double check everything.  Gun... check,  firmly in holster... check, photo ID... check, no printing... check.  LET'S GO!

You hop in your car and start to drive away.  Suddenly you're not so confident with yourself.  But that's alright

What if you brush against someone and they feel your gun.  Or what if you start printing?  Or what if the WORST thing possible happens (short of having to use it of course) and your holster has a catastrophic malfunction and your gun falls to the floor... IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?!  No

Of course in the grocery store you'll make some mistakes.  Maybe you reach for the milk on the top shelf because it has a better expiration date and you flash the handle of your gun.  Or possibly you bend down to grab your absolute favorite cereal and as you stand up your shirt catches on your grip.  You'll constantly be fixing your shirt and pulling it down.  You don't think anyone saw and you don't want to look 'sketchy' so you play it cool (think blues brothers level of cool).

You know what though?  It's OK you made those mistake because you learned from them.  Next time you'll know how not to make those mistakes.  Remember

As you approach the check out counter your adrenaline is still at the same level you went into the store with.  You pay and leave, all you can think about is ""I just walked through a store while carrying... finally! But what if an officer pulls me over now?  What do I say? What do I do?  WE NEVER WENT INTO THIS MUCH DETAIL DURING MY CC CLASS!"".  You pay extra attention to speed limits and laws, you do not want to get pulled over.  And finally, you're home... you've done it!

In Dallas, to work, to friends places/restaurants/movies/shopping, and back to my car to go home. In that kind of low-people-density scenario where cars are always used, I would somewhat easily know if there was a threat in advance. If I'm walking to my car, and someone is following me, I know something is wrong. If If I'm out somewhere and someone is shady/dangerous/psychotic

In Seattle, and there are dense crowds all around. Also, there are transient bums and psychotic people yelling and screaming on the street, who seem to pose threats, but 99.9% of the time never harm anyone. People asking for one thing or another approach you on the street constantly, usually pan handlers, but sometimes they don't always look like pan handlers. 

If I'm walking around in Seattle

The cherry on top is that this is a very liberal place

All in all, someone getting so close that you can't use the gun without risking it being taken away, and then getting screwed in the courts for using it, it's not worth it. 

I'm sure there are some real ninjas out there who have 100% confidence in their ability to always perceive threats from afar and use a gun without any risk of it being taken away

You could say ""well if you're carrying properly, but I accidentally bump into one of my techs, or a shelf, or the counter at least once a day.  *Eventually*, someone would notice that I was carrying despite my best efforts to conceal.

So it's not that I'm worried that [I would be fired after having to defend myself](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/fired-walgreens-gun-toting-michigan-pharmacist-filled-robbers/story?id=13705438#.T3xVQNXzQwY)

So you might say that, movies, restaurants and other places that aren't work, that it would still be worth it.  But how do you even build up the ""carry always, everywhere, no matter what"" mentality that is necessary for proper concealing when I can't carry outside my home the vast majority of times?  What would I even do with my CCW while I was at work?  I remember asking HR if it was ok to leave a gun in my car in the parking lot after signing that ""no firearms"" policy, and the guy had no actual clue so he said ""no"" just to be safe.

Basically I'm asking... what would you do in my position?  ""Get a new job where you can carry"" is not really an option.

**Edit:** I live in North Carolina and our state ""[does not have a blanket Parking Lot Storage law.](http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/northcarolina.pdf)""  Furthermore, then there's no law that says that I can, and they have the legal right to tell me that I can't.

A few months after treatment, and I was immediately hooked. I spent a few months deciding if I was ready to buy a gun. I mean, I gave it many hours of thought. My mom was a little weary at first, but after a few minutes talking to her she understood. I grew up around guns. My dad had a reloading setup in my bedroom closet (we lived in a small apartment growing up) and when I told him I bought a pistol, he didn’t say anything about it, in fact, I think he was delighted.
Now, there’s a few lines about being of sound mind to store a handgun, section d under ELIGIBILITY)

(f) Notwithstanding Subsection (d) (about storage)
diagnosed as suffering from a psychiatric disorder or condition described 
by Subsection (d) or listed in Subsection (e) is not because of that 
disorder or condition incapable of exercising sound judgment with respect 
to the proper use and storage of a handgun if the person provides the 
department with a certificate from a licensed physician whose primary 
practice is in the field of psychiatry stating that the psychiatric disorder or 
condition is in remission and is not reasonably likely to develop at a future 
time.

I’m currently tapering off my medication, and one even told me that he’s glad I’m almost off the medication because it made me “twitchy and paranoid.”
I don’t want to apply to the state for the CCW only to be denied and have to go though some sort of hearing
Guns are my favorite hobby (I’m not really an athletic kind of guy) and I take my security seriously being a past victim of violent crime, learned to completely disassemble and assemble and clean my gun, I thought to myself that I’d never kill myself, because then I wouldn’t enjoy my favorite hobby. As I write this I’m imagining a lot of people might say “fuck this crazy kid, he shouldn't have a gun or a CCW!!”
 Is there anyone here who has been in a similar situation? Did you have to provide documentation? Did you “declare” this when filling out the application? Or, but from what I hear, a fair percentage of people with permits don’t really give much thought about what circumstances they will pull their weapon or not… which kinda scares me.

Last night, CCW license holders may carry in courthouses (not court rooms), on school grounds, at athletic events, in churches, etc. - basically anywhere but what is prohibited by federal law.  I think our legislators did something good, for once...

Regarding the class - it was excellent.  The class covers the very basics, we had a great instructor who made it quite bearable.  There was absolutely no political commentary and no ""war stories"" from him, other than what qualified him to teach the class (SWAT training instructor and 3 years of overseas personal protection duty as a team leader).  The class I took was limited to 10 and there were a few of us with significant experience around firearms, just as there were 4 who had never previously handled a firearm.

Regarding course content: The class followed the NRA curriculum and covered the basic parts of pistols, etc., as well as proper grip and stance. The most beneficial addition to the NRA required material was the section on MS law - when and where you can carry, as well as obligations and planning each CCW license holder should consider. There is a written test and a range qualification (shot on a bowling pin target) - 5 rounds shot at 3, 5, 7 and 10 yards on night 1; same for night 2, with the addition of two 5 round magazines at 5 yards

For those who have to take classes to get CCW

The success of the company has been such that, but there have times. A few other employees are known to also have ccw permits, including (at least) one of the four principles of our small family-owned company. 

The employee handbook states that ""Inappropriate behavior may include""... *Using or possessing a firearm or other weapon on company property*. It seems fairly straightforward

edit: You guys have all been great! I have got a lot of recommendations on the Walther PPK but I preferred the PK380 in the store. I was wondering if anyone had good experience with both and could weigh in on the pro's and cons. I have also had a lot of recommendations for guns out of my price range. I would like to stay under $600 so that I could buy it in the next few weeks. If I wait for next Christmas I could get a Kimber, and have a toddler, so money is tight.

He had thrown his gun on the front seat of the Acura (according to him). He was on the phone with his wife that was letting him in the gate, but the guy in the Toyota thought he was trying to tailgate.  The three individuals in the Toyota claimed he pointed a gun at them to get them to move from blocking the gate.
