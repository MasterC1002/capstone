1353948258.0,13th1y,Choosing/Tweaking The Right Lifting Program,NoMediocrity,353,55,52,"Special thanks to /u/CaptainSarcasmo

##Intro##
Over the years I have seen a common trend of lifters choosing programs ill-suited for their goals, using Smolov Jr. when their work sets are 55 lbs., or an intermediate lifter jumping on Smolov (just the base mesocycle portion) and then wonder where their strength gains went after a couple weeks off the program.  

Similarly, “What the hell are you doing?!” but that serves no purpose other than (impolitely) informing the lifter you don’t agree with their plan.  

Just last week

So, what should I do?” I am speaking from my own experience and the experience of others I have observed.  This is not an algorithm to determine what program to do, but rather, outline several important points that should be considered every time one wants to move to a different training methodology.  It is merely a guide I’ve followed when choosing my programming or recommending a program to another person, nothing more.

##Goals##
The first step, “I want to get stronger” or more specific, “I want to add 30 lbs to my squat.”  From these two simple goals, there’s already a variation in the type of programs that would be generally recommended.  In the first case, no specifics are stated so a generic strength program like Starting Strength or 5/3/1 might be suggested (based on the lifter’s experience) whereas in the second example, a focus on squats is required, so Texas Method or Smolov could be possibilities (no mention was made of maintaining or increasing the bench press or deadlift, but they might not be optimal for the chosen goals.

The more explicit one can be with their goals, a time constraint, and encompasses more than just one lift.  Additionally, the more experience a lifter has, the better (and more realistic) goals they can create.

For example

Another possibility is that the lifter knows they get a lot of carryover from their overhead press to their bench press but not from their bench press to their overhead press.  With this nugget of information

A final example might be a lifter needing more conditioning work while increasing strength.  This could be accomplished many different ways, speed sets, less rest time, drop sets, etc.  Knowing ahead of time that there will be conditioning work will allow better choosing or planning (such as making sure the heavy squat day is not after a farmer’s walk / sled push conditioning day that was added in to achieve a conditioning goal).

##Progression##
Knowing the correct periodization scheme a user can follow will go a long way in not just choosing a good training program, so tweaks and personalization they make to a program will likely give higher dividends in part due to their experience).  

I believe that a lifter should attempt to follow the most aggressive form of periodization they can.  That is, if a lifter can only increase strength from week to week, weekly progression programs should be chosen.  If a lifter chooses periodization that is not aggressive enough, they are not quite wasting time, but they are underutilizing their body’s ability to adapt.  However, if they choose too aggressively, the worst-case scenario is a deload followed by switching to a slower periodization format.

##Internal Factors##
Part of choosing or tweaking a program is evaluating the program itself to see if it’s in line with your primary and secondary goals.  When trying to increase your squat, if a lifter wants to increase their bench but the program they’re on has them overhead pressing too much and it starts hindering their bench workouts, they need to reevaluate if the overhead pressing work is necessary for their goals.

In addition to the lifts within a program, would be vastly different.  High-volume / high-intensity programs run while on a cut will increase the risk for injury as the energy needed to recovery 100% will most likely be lacking.

##External Factors##
When choosing or tweaking a program, moving apartments/homes, deaths in the family, etc. can certainly derail a lifter or the program’s planned progression.  While unplanned factors can’t always be expected or prevented, there are methods to mitigate their impact.  What can be prevented are known external factors such as work schedule or planned vacations.

###Expected Interruptions###
Known external factors such as a consistent work schedule or a planned vacation can certainly affect the appropriate training program to follow, a program that follows something along the lines of weekly/monthly progression is less likely to be affected from a week off (such as 5/3/1 or Texas Method).  In those cases, the program can be started and after the seven days off, the lifter could simply try to repeat the last week or rollback a single week.  With programs like Starting Strength, missing a single workout will not make or break the program, despite the amount of posts and stress I’ve seen from such a situation.  
Another example might be planning to move apartments/houses, but condense the workout schedule and also be following a deload-week format so that weights are lighter and workouts are shorter.  Regardless, these types of known interruptions should be considered when picking a program and mitigated to the best to your ability.

###Unexpected Interruptions###
There will also be times when there are unexpected interruptions to a program and they can throw a wrench into a lifter’s program.  In some cases, deloading, or switching to a more appropriate program for the foreseeable future.  The important thing to realize here is not that the original program was wrong; it just was not suited for the new situation.  

So long as the trainee is training seriously

##Experience##
The more experienced the lifter, whereas a newer lifter has almost no personal experience to draw from, and using the experience of other lifters will most likely be incorrect to some degree due to personal variations between lifters (work schedule, sleep, nutrition, cutting/bulking, personal stress, etc.).  I firmly believe new lifters should not be designing their own programs and that more advanced lifters certainly can write their own programs.  I don’t believe in any hard numbers (ex “you must have 3 years of serious training first”) but it’s a gradient from unacceptable to acceptable/expected depending on the lifter.  

Similarly, workouts, or weeks, the more advanced lifter will have a better idea on how to get back on track (retry a set, deload one week, repeat a week, etc.) based on what they have done in similar situations in the past.  I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen posts in either r/Fitness or r/Weightroom asking, what do?” and 9 out of 10 times

1344441962.0,xvx42,Why the USA isn't winning at weightlifting ,glennpendlay,289,63,167,"This question was asked in another thread

The answer is not simple, but together they make it very difficult for us to win.

The first thing is the thing that everyone likes to talk about the most, Knott, Chaplin, and Barnett make the podium in the last 15 years in the Olympics, World's and Junior Worlds.  Germany has a very strict drug testing program and they produce more ""A"" session lifters than us by far.  But, once you are ""in the club"" so to speak, people start talking to honestly about drug use, no question at all.  Among the right crowd

The second issue is the talent pool.  Weightlifting in the USA simply does not pull enough of the really really gifted athletes.  We get a few of them, and 20 Cheryl Hayworth's.  If we had 10 lifters in the 85kg class with the talent of Farris, it is very likely that the the stars would align for one of them, and we would see lifts that put someone on the podium, drug testing or no drug testing.  

The third issue is our culture, as a culture, simply do not idolize strength or weightlifting as much as they do in some parts of the world.  And, for those with great athletic talent, there are many, many other ways to display it that pay much greater dividends financially and also award the winners with more notoriety. And, we are a wealthy country.  That is great, becoming a great lifter puts you ahead in life, a route to international travel that he otherwise might never have had, buying a house

You put these things together, but USADA suddenly turned a 180 and started actively HELPING us cheat and beat the tests at international competitions, then yes, I think with the culture we have and the athletes we have today, we could be very, very competitive.

Or, where it was often the best choice to fame and fortune, where a person could make a better life for himself or herself through weightlifting than they could without the sport, then yes, in that situation too, we could do very well.

But you put these things together, MuscleDriverUSA, is right now paying monthly stipends for living expenses, and covering all competition and travel related costs for a group of 10 lifters, to allow them to train full time, this is a recent development and nothing like this has happened since the late 60's and early 70's.  But we, as a country can do better in a lot of ways.  All of us, coaches

But, is childish.  To say that we can't compete and get beat just because everyone else is on drugs is also childish.  ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,

I've run 70sBig.com for nearly three years; I'm a strength and conditioning coach and writer who teaches lifting technique and programming. I have written two intermediate strength training e-books (The Texas Method: Part 1 and The Texas Method: Advanced) and a fitness/S&amp;C book with professors Dr. Lon Kilgore and Dr. Michael Hartman called FIT. I also coach raw powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. I've worked with nearly every population imaginable including Special Operations soldiers from every branch of the military (including international teams); football, basketball, softball, and swimming athletes; paraplegics and cancer survivors; obese and skinny folks; injured trainees requiring rehabilitation; CrossFitters, Olympic weightlifters, and raw powerlifters. I just handled six lifters that qualified for the Arnolds and one of them, Chris Riley


My general philosophy is just an old school mentaily: get strong with barbells and then use high intensity or sport specific conditioning. I am a practitioner who acquires information and makes sure it fits with a stress--&gt;recovery--&gt;adaptation concept within the confines of anatomy and physiology. My expertise probably lies within this ability to bring perspective in turning conceptual physiology stuff into application. I also study anatomy daily and regularly teach prehab (in the form of ""doing mobility"") and rehab (which pisses off a lot of PTs). But any thoughts or recommendations are always dependent on an individual


If you ask a question about your programming, but there are a hundred ""right ways"" to make progress and only a few ways you can make optimal progress. Efficiency is key, because if we're gonna spend all of this time training or talking about training, then we sure as shit want to make the most out of our time. Let's get the desired adaptation with the lowest dose of stress -- otherwise we'll just drive our dicks into the ground (or burn the labia off --&gt; the female equivalent was requested at one of my seminars). Give your gender, age, ht/wt, body comp, concise summary of recent program


I played a variety of sports growing up, especially defenses, so if you want to talk about that, have at it. I competed in Olympic weightlifting for a bit and went to nationals in 2010. I don't currently train exclusively for a barbell sport; there are a lot of things that get in the way of training, including my hobbies. My training currently revolves around doing the Olympic lifts and strength lifts in between bouts of climbing mountains. I climbed a mountain last Saturday and then last night I went 125/155 on sn/cj (missed a 130 sn twice and cleaned 160 and 162.5 only to miss the jerks). 


I have been involved with CrossFit in the past and present. I was one of the youngest people to get their Level II (apparently this doesn't exist anymore?!??)


As a side note


- I have a B.S. in Kinesiology
- I was a full time coach (at least 10 hours a day) for 18 months and would never do it again
- Some people that I enjoy learning from and talking to are Lon Kilgore, Shannon Green, as well as various lesser known coaches, lifters, or trainees
- I've done a case study on high intensity conditioning
- Hobbies include reading (mostly sci-fi/fantasy/non-fiction), dog playing/training, shooting, and a few videogames
- I've read too many books to create a favorites list
- I'm a Cleveland Browns fan
- I nerd the fuck out on anatomy stuff pretty often
- I've traveled around quite a bit doing seminars
- I enjoy learning
- I pull training ideas from everywhere for programming. I've pulled training ideas from communication books. 
- I studied sport psychology for a while and even was in a master's program. I employ sport psych stuff regularly on lifters
- I could write at least 100 pages on coaching and how I think about the coach/trainee interaction at various stages. 
- I have been around CrossFit HQ folks in depth
- My username for videogames is ""ScroteScrote"" or ""MajorMajor""
- My friends are all pretty funny and unique
- I like guns. And knives. And adventuring. 
- One of my favorite sports to play nowadays is volleyball. 
- I really like Australian people
- I have big interest in the military special operations personnel and regularly work with them. 
- Don't get me started on exercise science research
- I've been told I'm pretty good at giving life advice (this outta be good). 



For real...ask me anything. While I'm pretty transparent
Please don't make this shit boring.  I listen, weird them out, or piss them off so that they listen. I don't give advice or recommendations if I can't validate it with a clear, well thought-out line of reasoning. I'll admit when I'm wrong; I don't know everything. When I don't, I have friends that probably do.

1359858821.0,17sbvl,Why You Should Be Doing More Pull Ups ,gzcl,273,58,184,"I’m sure many of you in this sub are already doing pull ups. If not, what is enough?” That is the question I intend to answer with this post. No, both of my own training and others’

First

I started doing pull-ups

Because it wasn’t until four years later that I started to deadlift- and just six months after occasionally doing the deadlift I pulled 405 pounds at a whopping 142 pounds bodyweight. That’s a full four years of training my back strength with pull-ups before I even tried the deadlift once. It is my belief that my pull-up strength directly benefitted my ability to deadlift. 

I didn’t start going to the gym until September of 2008, as I could not be bothered to actually learn a complicated lift such as the squat or deadlift. Six months into going to the gym regularly I pulled 405 on a whim. I hadn’t made any notable progress in any of my lifts besides bench press and pull-ups. The latter from the low 20’s to the upper 30’s for reps and 115 pounds added for weighted singles. 

The pull-up is key because it strengthens your latissimus dorsi, right? Anyways, what I’m getting at is this- strong lats will make for a strong pull. And if you want to be strong you might want to put a lot of focus on the one muscle group that spans the entire length of your torso. I do however understand that not all exceptional deadlifters could bang out an exceptional amount of pull-ups. But my theory is this, being exceptional at pull-ups may very well make you an exceptional deadlifter. I’ll present the following as evidence of my position.

Benedikt Magnusson has stated, especially Magnusson weighing in at nearly 400 pounds, then surely there is something to be said for its carry over to deadlifting ability. Those are just two examples of exemplary deadlifters who are also fans of the pull-up for developing back strength. I’m sure there are many other great deadlifters out there who are also fans of the pull up, [Matt Kroczaleski](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8874JYBIODQ) and [Jamie Lewis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaieUDOPnbY) immediately come to mind. I will let you find more evidence of the pull-ups inclusion in great lifters programming. 

How about the squat? What do you squeeze in order to get your back tight in preparation for a heavy squat? Your lats. Ever try a heavy squat without having your back tight? 

But how often should the pull up be trained? I’m confident in saying daily. Which is quite a bit more often than you could train the deadlift. The pull-up is great because if trained right it can be done with very little eccentric portion of the lift and therefore a lifters ability to recover from it is increased- much like that of the snatch and clean and jerk. This is important because delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is primarily caused by the eccentric portion of movements; and if a lifter can avoid soreness then the lifter can continue to lift regularly without being inhibited by it. Now of course doing eccentric-less weighted pull-ups is probably a bad idea. I’m not saying you should do that

Day 1- Weighted X 5 X 5

Day 2- Bodyweight X Max Reps X 3 Sets

Add weight linearly. Repeat until you’re flying on wings of glory. 

As it stands right now I’m still training my pull-ups nearly every day in such a fashion. I do however switch out pull-ups for lightweight high rep lat pull downs if I’m feeling terribly sore. 

The idea of alternating the same movement in heavy/light days is very popular in the weightlifting community both because it allows the lifter to become more familiar with the movement and that the higher volume/ lower intensities on the following day tends to aid in recovery by pumping blood- and therefore oxygen and nutrients- into the damaged muscle group.  And as I’ve explained previously the pull-up can be trained nearly without an eccentric portion- if done right; it could then be theorized that the lift may be trained similarly to the snatch and clean and jerk. 

Not only that but it’s an excellent addition if you require extra grip work. Furthermore the added strength will help keep your upper back more upright while squatting and the added width will help create a more stable base which to bench press off of. Did I forget to mention that if you’re not using your lats while pressing you’re probably [doing it wrong?]( http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/are_you_ready_to_overhead_press)

[Here’s a great article from 70’s big]( http://70sbig.com/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/) on why having awesome lats are integral to having an awesome bench

I didn’t write this because I’m trying to speak from a position of authority or experience for being an excellent deadlifter

That’s a lot of time hanging from a bar. 

**Edit:** I forgot to add an [interesting piece](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/lats_not_just_for_pulldowns;jsessionid=08D7E4D5ED927881621A52402F19857D-mcd02.hydra) about how sprint speed can be directly related to lat strength.

I got into the sport around 2000 via kickboxing and then made a transition to more wrestling because I moved. I made it to a level you could probably consider pro-am (or at least that's what we were calling it) before a combination of a motorcycle wreck (lolMirMode) and school kept me from competing or training with any regularity. Now I've recently transitioned to full-time strength training but still keep up with the sport and help spar with/train fighters on occasion. So I guess this is partly me paying it forward and partly a bit of a goodbye to the sport the really defined my youth and made me who I am today.

**General Philosophy**

Now that that's out of the way, and it would be silly to do so. Generally speaking, if you're weak in an area of the fight game, crosstraining in the associated sport will make you better. For instance, if your boxing sucks because of physical limitations (speed, endurance, etc), really. A running back's training program certainly isn't going to look like a noseguard's

In MMA training, then I would say that could be a good bet for MMA training unless they get too caught up in the macho ""fight through the injuries"" that's all too common in the fight game. Otherwise, you're probably better off training for your specific game or style, so that's how I'm going to break this down. Think of each of the following sections as modules you can plug into your training, depending on how many hours a week you want to spend and what your goals are.

One other caveat to this is that technique will almost always trump crosstraining. Your goal is to fight. If your fighting technique is poor, crappy, or disappears the moment you eat a stiff jab, you should focus on that rather than crosstraining. Crosstraining exists to enhance your ability to execute the skills you know and the strategy you've set. If you lack skill, strategy, or both, you should spend more time in the ring or on the pads than in the gym.

**Special newbie lifter note**

If you have been training for less than about 2 years or have never done a strength program, but who cares? Lifting numbers aren't your goal if your main sport is MMA. But please do take into account the notes in the striking sections below.

If you're more experienced or have lifted weights before

Anyway, so I've broken it up, which will probably make discussion (and telling me I'm a dumbass) easier too.

**Conclusion**

Pick your weakest ""module"" and focus on that. Or, then switch them around. Alternatively, peruse the various sections and find the common exercises (suitcase carries, woodchoppers, lumberjack presses, power cleans, and front squats would probably make a good base program).

I hope this helps someone. It's most of what I've learned about crosstraining for MMA over my years of fighting. Good luck, have fun.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1366810854.0,,

1352696789.0,131rj2,[Meet Report] 2012 IPL World Powerlifting Championship ,gzcl,220,25,130,"On Friday

**Training:**

My last powerlifting meet was in January and since then I had the idea in mind to do another meet in the fall of this year. However it wasn't until August or September that I decided on the IPL Worlds. Between January and this week my programming was mostly of my own design. The exception is my 5/3/1 mod with periodized accessory work

My programming is built primarily around a structure resembling 5/3/1

I could write an e-book on my training methodology so I'll end it here. If there is interest, that what works well for one wont always create the same results for another. So really, how I train doesn't really matter (at least in my perspective). If any of you have questions about it and want a more detailed description just ask. 

**Dieting** (AKA

Back in late July and early August I was in the mid to low 170s. For this meet I had to diet down to around 160. I accomplished this by cutting carbs to around 100g per day on most days of the week with one cheat day or so per week. Once September rolled around I just made sure to eat less food over all and still keep an eye on my carbs. My mantra for this stage of the game is

I did this by limiting my carbs to less than 50g per day every day until weigh-ins. As the day came nearer my carb consumption continued to lower. The Monday before weigh-ins I consumed 2g of carbs. 

**Water Cut**

I followed /u/NoMediocrity's methods detailed [here](http://ctrlaltlift.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-i-make-weight-for-2-hour-weigh-ins.html). Except I went against his advice of doing a carb and sodium load on the Friday prior to weigh-ins and just did a sodium load. (Sorry bro

I didn't even have to hot bath, that was fun. Ended up making weight at a whopping 146.6 pounds. [Here is me, the night before weigh-ins, feeling like shit, but very lean and dehydrated. This is the leanest I've been, ever, and I estimate it to be around 7-8%.](http://imgur.com/a/SA2sn) 

Now for what you all care about.

**The Meet**

I'll just get to the gist of this.  

Squat 1: 375 

Squat 2: 397

Squat 3: 407

Bench 1: 248

Bench 2: 264

Bench 3: 275

Deadlift 1: 451

Deadlift 2: 485 

Deadlift 3: 512

Deadlift 4: 529 (4th attempt allowed for World Record Attempts)

I went 10/10 on all my lifts. Broke the California Mens Open deadlift record and total record. My Powerlifting total is 1,211 pounds. The 529 pound deadlift is a new IPL World Record. 

**TLDR:** [Video of all my lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4571kZqpA&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Overall, the experience in itself is worth of showing up. Also, shout out to /u/failon and his brother for coming out there and meeting up with me. He's a fucking monster of a man and has a 10 lb brain when it comes to all things lifting and kinesiology. 

Now get out there and lift.

1366962723.0,1d54x7,My experience with the 5/3/1 BBB 3-Month Challenge &amp; the benefits of strength self-assessments,acconrad,221,39,65,"I recently milked the last of a Texas Method cycle to bring up my squat and needed something slightly less painful with more of a focus on hypertrophy to increase my bodyweight (which helps with a higher bench and squat). Being harshly competitive

**The Program:**

* I hit all of my 5/3/1 sets, the general consensus was that 5-weeks were the hardest and 5/3/1 weeks were the easiest...so easy that if I had to do 415x1 in the deadlift, for example, that I would take a 4-5 min break and do another set, say 435x1. And I hit all of those. This is mostly because I purposely took Jim's advice of starting with 90% of my training 1RM, as to compensate for the additional hypertrophy load. Either way, I learned for myself that 1-3 rep ranges reflect my true strength more than 5RM, especially depending on your sport**.
* The actual ""3 Month Challenge"" part where your first accessory exercise reflects 50%, explosive on the up). **Now I understand why bodybuilders get big on such light weights.** That was not an easy first cycle when you adhere to Time Under Tension guidelines. **Cycle 2 (60%)** was significantly harder. GVT recommends you choose your 10x10 weight based on 50% of your 1RM, and jumping up an additional 10% really screws up your ability to maintain a 40X0 tempo. I think for this cycle i was doing something more along the lines of 20X0, but got all of my reps, albeit with some huffing and puffing. **Cycle 3 (70%) was the real challenge**. Holy shit, you have to be some sort of golden boy to do 5x10 at 70% of your training max. I failed to hit get 50 reps on all 5 exercises. It generally went 10, 8, 5,  leave your ego at the door and see how well you can do.**
* Other accessory work from Wendler was optional, not just your main lifts.**

So in the end

START (training maxes

198 lbs bw

175 OHP

265 Bench

340 squat

405 dead

FINISH** (training maxes

205 lbs bw

195 OHP

280 Bench

370 squat

435 deadlift 

** - I hit 290 in my bench

**The Assessment:**

After completing the program I wanted to determine strength symmetry to see how balanced my strength was across my body and see if I could pinpoint any weaknesses that I could work on to further increase my strength numbers for future cycles

The guide says to base everything off of whatever rep max you used for your base exercise - so I decided to use my Cycle 3, I know that I stated earlier that 1-3 rep ranges more accurately portrayed my strength, but one limitation I have is that my gym only has DB up to 100 lbs, so I knew that I needed a universally higher rep range to limit the amount of exercises that would require above 100lb DBs.

As with the workout program, especially for advances trainees, and 1.4-1.5x deadlift is more commonly seen in beginner/advanced trainees.

I also did the assessment on Cycle 3, such as the calf-raises and concentration curls. I can confirm this because I actually didn't get a chance to do the EZ-bar Skull Crushers until Cycle 3, Week 2 and found my tricep strength to be much greater than it was the week before, especially because it was my first accessory exercise so I was fresh. I further confirmed this by doing a set of Tricep Pressdowns, which after re-assessment, was nearly 10 lbs stronger in a 1RM than the week before, mainly because it was my 2nd accessory lift on that day as opposed to the 5th accessory lift from the previous week.

**My personal assessment results: [for your viewing pleasure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJdKiUA9Rl9dDVQT1k1b09wbTRuU3RFUGNhUEtDcUE&amp;usp=sharing)**.

NOTE: I am aware that 3 exercises were not assessed. I plan on assessing them next week but due to work schedule and limited time for the gym

**EDIT: ON NUTRITION**

*Since that in itself is lengthy

**CONCLUSION/FINDINGS:**

* My life as an anti-bench bro (strength mostly from non-mirror muscles) has left me with weak biceps as my most obvious glaring weakness. This was evident with direct curls but even pull ups - I'd get stuck 1/2 way up a pull-up
* Pretty good strength symmetry between the front and back of my body. However it's clear that much of my strength from my upper body is attributed to my pecs and lats. I never get stuck at the bottom of the bench or OHP because my pecs/lats get that first bit out, so shoulders are also another weakness.
* My actual 5RM for the Front Squat should have been 225
* While I did fine with bulgarian split squats, the BSS is a hip exercise, so clearly there is a muscular imbalance between my legs and my left glute is not firing properly.
* **WHAT I NEED FOR ASSISTANCE WORK:** lots of BB curls, lots of heavy abs, seated safety bar good mornings, single leg hip thrusts, bulgarian split squats

***TL;DR:*** **Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB 3-Month Challenge is actually fucking hard - mostly because it starts out deceptively easy and ramps up incredibly quickly. 50% 5x10 is pretty easy

**Comprehensive strength assessments are crucial if you are a serious weight trainer because it will help you find your weak links so you can focus on bringing them up rather than waste time on the things you're already strong at.**

After my meet last August, but I messed around a lot, stayed well within my comfort zone, and took some time to mentally reboot.  When I came home for Christmas break, I resumed serious training again.  My lifts were essentially unchanged from August, but my body felt great and I was mentally fresh.

Most of my squat training basically boiled down to breaking rep maxes and paused squat maxes.  I did much more of my training low bar this time around than last time just to give it a shot.  It worked well but definitely beat my elbows up more than high bar.  I'd squat hard about 2 days a week

My bench training was basically non-existent.  I did a fair amount of overhead work and benched maybe one or two days a week

Rack pulls helped my deadlift considerably.  When I miss deadlifts, and my traps are being torn off of my neck, not that the weight is actually too heavy for my back, hammies, and hips.  The rack pulls got all those tissues used to the heavy loads without hurting my strength off the floor at all.  645 was super rough at my last meet after doing most of my pulls from the floor or a low box, but after working from knee height and upper shins a lot this time around, 650 was a cake opener.

Other things that helped a lot were doing lunges and a lot of split stance work to keep my hip flexors long and strong.  Playing catch with a medicine ball in a bottom lunge position is great for strength strength, I did a ton of bodyweight glute bridges really focusing on getting my inactive left glute to fire.  It's not quite there yet, but is noticeably better than when I started.  A big thanks to Bret Contreras for the suggestion that I focus on symmetrical activation moreso than really heavy loading for my thrusts.  It certainly payed off.

The weight cut:

In December I was 225 when I found out Mash Elite was bringing a team to this meet.  The number one goal was to dominate the team competition.  The plan was for Travis to dominate at 220 and I'd take 242, salt on Thursday, and stopped drinking except for a few sips on Thursday night.  My scale read 240 on Thursday night and 236.5 on Friday morning.  No sweat, right?  Except that when I showed up for weigh-ins, I was slightly over.  I guess my scale at home likes telling me I'm slim and sexy instead of telling me the right weight.  However, losing some clothes and taking a pee put me right on the money at 242.  More drama than I'd have liked, but nothing crazy.  Glad I played it safe and did a mini-cut.  I wasn't in the mood to go back home and sweat for a couple hours.

After that, and I dominated a Chinese buffet for about an hour, and later that evening I ate two pizza and the better part of a half gallon of ice cream.

The meet:

Squat:

Warmups felt great.  I'd only lifted with a monolift once before, 315, 405, 495 (belt on), 585, 635 (wraps on), show time.

Opener - 675:  A little drama.  Apparently I shrunk after they took my rack height.  They had to lower it for me to get it out

Second - 725:  Same deal with the rack height.  They forgot to change it on my sheet

Third - 750:  I thought about going higher after how 725 felt, but leaving some weight on the platform was worth it because I knew 750 was what I needed to hit.

Bench:

My elbow was bugging me after the squat, 315, 365, 385, show time.

Opener - 405:  Easy.  3 Whites.

Second - 425:  Looked like my opener.  3 Whites. 6 pound meet PR.

Third - 435:  Also felt light, but reds for the dip.  No lift.

Deadlift:

My back was a little tight and my left hip was a little sore going into deadlifts, but that went away as I was pulling my warmups.  135, 225, 315, 405, 495, 585

Opener - 650:  Speed pull.  2 whites.  I got one red because I locked out my hips so hard one judge said the bar bounced off my hips like a clean pull

Second - 710:  Never a question.  I shuffled a foot while I was sitting it down so I was a little afraid they'd be nit picky about that

Third - Passed.  I could have gone for a 1900 total

Overall - New all-time WRs for both squat and total despite leaving some weight on the platform.  It was a solid 7 for 8 day with just one technical miscue.

Thanks:

First and foremost, she's kept me from hurting myself doing stupid stuff which has allowed me to improve my best meet total by almost 450 in that time frame.  I honestly don't know what I'd do without her.  Also, she hit her first 300 deadlift like a joke last week (I like bragging on her):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDNkQyKRoU0

Thanks to Travis for everything he's taught me about lifting and the opportunity he's given me to work and train at the best gym in the country.  Thanks to Steve Maxon for putting on a great meet.  Thanks to Ryan Coplen of Rhino Fitness for not minding that I bend all his bars when I'm at school.

Miscellaneous stories from the day:

I saw a 780 geared bench that was stupidly impressive.  They used the same bar for everyone's benches

After my third deadlift, I dropped down and my feet slipped right out from under me on the concrete floor.  My last deadlift was the only lift of the day I wasn't relaxed and cracking jokes for, so it was a fitting way to bring some levity so the situation and bring me back to reality.

In the video for the meet, and by sheer will and hard work he made university nationals in OL, pulled triple bodyweight, and is a couple tenths away on his 40 yard dash from making the Olympic bobsled team.  It's an awkward video, but we're both sort of awkward people so it's fitting.

The legendary Mark Chaillet was the one who gave me my drug test.  As we're walking to the bathroom, you don't need a f***ing drug test anyways; you're fat enough that I can tell you don't use anything, but it's the rules.""  I got a compliment and a burn in the same sentence; I feel strangely honored.  I asked him what training advice he had.  The two things:  get stronger abs (always good advice), and only train squat, bench, and deadlift once every 3 weeks.  I was pretty perplexed by the second bit, but he told I could email him if I had any more questions, and it clearly worked for him (he was a 900+ deadlifter).

As you may or may not know, has recently released a new book, titled Пауэрлифтинг: от новичка до мастера (Powerlifting: from the newbie to the master). I found out about the book from this post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1eddl3/new_book_by_sheiko/ (Thanks, Aagr14).

But more to the point. I now have a copy in my possession. It's a [very nice looking book](http://i.imgur.com/CHhjenB.jpg) and about 500 pages long. I intend to translate it. However, some will no doubt be more interesting than others. Here's what I ask: read the introduction, then let me know what section or chapter you are most interested in. I will take everyone's suggestions into consideration and begin translating the proper sections. Obviously, I will not wait until the entire project is finished to release parts of it. As every section is finished, I will post it in /r/weightroom -- assuming the mods have no problem with this.

For the record

*Translator's note:* Though there is no substitution for reading a work in the original, concern or suggestion on a particular tract, please don't hestitate to send me a message. While I am taking great care to translate everything properly, sometimes there may be ways to more eloquently phrase a particular sentence.

**Without further ado

One of the most important and effective ways of strengthening health and character, which appeared outside of Russia near the end of the 40s, beginning of the 50s, in the 20th century. It arrived in Russia even later, and today powerlifting is spreading dynamically throughout the entire world.

During the study of sports training as a means of achieving maximum athlete potential, tactical, mental and integrated [104, 135, 144]. The contents of the following work [1, 11, 21, 43, 155, 194

Once the reader gets acquainted with the **fourth chapter**, since during intense physical stress there is an exchange of substances in the body. The reader will also learn how excretory functions work and what role hormones play during this process, as well as how a person’s motor processes is based off of their body’s somatotype and constitutional psychology. In addition to everything listed, the chapter looks at the work of the main muscle groups during competition exercises, as well as other physiological questions.
	
The material in the **fifth chapter** acquaints readers with the general understanding of technique in powerlifting and the phase structure of competition exercises and their periodization. The chapter presents, done by powerlifter athletes at the highest tier of their sport. Their technique for every form of the competition exercises is analyzed with the use of video.

We are using what most of you call the ""Texas Method"" programming.  This program is a bit unique in that it came directly from lifters, I was using a program of multiple sets of 5, done 3 days a week for a group of maybe 20 or so weightlifters.  They did this on top of a significant volume snatches and clean and jerks, and, it worked pretty well.  It was a lot of hard work, but it was getting results.  But, by Friday, it was pretty hard to motivate guys to go to the squat rack at the end of their workouts and plow through 3-5 sets of 5 reps on the squat.  I had a few lifters try to bargain with me, he never liked to do multiple sets of 5.  I agreed to let a few of them do that, the guys who were doing this

Well

So, it worked really well.  And eventually it got named the ""Texas Method"" and now it is pretty widely used it seems.

So, and does his maximal set, his attempt at a PR, on Saturday.  The real key is how you adjust your Monday weight and volume in comparison to your PR day, which for us is Saturday.  Kaleb started this workout about 6 weeks ago, and was doing 440lbs for 3 sets of 5 on Monday, front squatting on Wednesday, I felt the volume on Monday was what was driving his progress.  He went from 440, to 473 for 2 sets, after 2 sessions of snatch/clean and jerk

Hopefully this is a good demonstration of how the different days interact with each other when using this training method

My situation: Starting Strength for a few months

I wound up going with [Supreme Sports Performance and Training] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/supreme-sports-performance-and-training-rockville) in Rockville

It was incredibly valuable. There really is no substitute for a trained professional being there with you live to help you tweak your form and give you tips back on your height, etc. I never did sports in school, so this was even more valuable for my weak ass. I wish I'd done this a few months ago when I was just starting out.

Gym: Cool to go to a real strength training gym. Professional cages, no ellipticals, nobody trying to sell me stuff I don't need.

Training: We went through a lot of different cues and found ones that worked for me. We also went over video of my lifts right after I completed them. Like a lot of novice lifters

Squat: I was having trouble keeping my wrists locked throughout the lift. Part of that stems from my squid-like physiology. But the coach also told me Rippetoe tends to recommend a lower bar position than one that would work for me. We found a higher position that hit my “shelf.” My squats felt so much more comfortable. I might want to get wrist straps going forward. We also talked about treating each squat like its own mini-set. I needed to take more time to focus and maintain form between each rep. I was making the mistake of trying to “finish” the set rather than properly complete it. The coach had me count off “1-1000, they think “puff your chest out,” but that can cause you to arch your lower back. What’s more helpful for me is to picture how your traps contract when you do a lat pulldown. This worked well with another cue: “break the bar over your back.”

Deadlift: Learned to get tense before the lift and close the small gap between the bar and the plates BEFORE starting the lift. Failing to do so had been causing me to let my hips get ahead of my arms and back. They also emphasized speed in getting the bar up.

Bench: I was way off here

Didn’t have time to go over the press or powerclean. I suspect I’ll be back in a few months. (My comfort level with the press is higher and I've been using Pendlay Rows instead of powercleans.)

I would also say all in all it was well worth it. And for other novice lifters

9/9, lowest I’ve weighed for the 132s, all-time meet PR regardless of weight, Wilks PR, coached a good friend’s first PL meet (she hit around a 340 Wilks like a boss).  Before going into the details, this was pretty much the best meet I could have ever asked for and then some.

##Thanks##

I would like to thank two people in particular

* gzcl - for always being there to discuss training, and always keeping it real.  We give each other shit all the time, but it's always in good fun to push each other to be better than the day before.  Total bromance goin on.
* smoftie - for doing your first meet like a boss, and being an awesome person, even if you do go full-tard too often.

##Pre-Meet##

Between the San Jose Open I did back in October and this meet, I really didn’t have a program, but it wasn’t fucking around either – just listening to my body and attempting to make smart work-set selections each week.  **That's right, I did my own thing and didn't follow a program, gasp**.  For bench, that meant hitting a 5 lb single rep heavier than the week before, doing a couple sets of 8-10 reps at around 135, **I trained sumo and then pulled a conventional PR in competition**, but when I started to have my eye on it

##Dat Der Meet##

This was a pretty large meet, which was absolutely perfect.  This allowed me to focus on her during her flight and her warm-ups (while flight D went) and then switch to my warm-ups and my lifts during the other flights, so I couldn’t have asked for better scheduling in that regard.

###Squats###

My squat warm-ups were pretty standard, so I felt like that might have been the cause.  I decided to basically say fuck it and keep my thumb over the bar and deal with any elbow pain a bit later.

Squat opener at 165 kg / 363 lbs flew up pretty fast and felt good, but the rep itself was still pretty fluid and way faster than I was expecting so with that in mind, I said fuck it all, we’re going to PR territory and put down 185 kg / 407.9 lbs as my third attempt.  I visualized the lift several times before doing it, tried to treat it just like any other lift, and then crushed that shit.  All-time PR in the books and 3.2xBW squat given 3 white lights by USAPL judges … so far so good.

###Bench###

Bench was tricky beast, but after a ridiculously easy 198, I put down 97.5 kg / 214 lbs as my second attempt, so that I could either make a small nudge to 220 or a bit higher if it felt good.  After the second attempt (another set of 3 white lights), I realized 220 was going to happen without a problem, so I decided 226 would be better (231 probably wasn’t going to go, plus that would be 16 lbs heavier than anything I’ve done since the injury).  226 was slow, just had to be patient with it.

###Deadlifts###

Deadlift warm-ups initially felt a little heavy, I changed up my form a bit to have the bar an inch further in front of me than normal, allowing me to get an extremely small roll with the bar to engage my lats and load the hamstrings.  I don’t know if that’s really helped, but it feels nice and prevents me from taking forever to just pull the bar.  187.5 kg / 413 lbs stupidly easy, like all my deadlift openers have been.  I went to 197.5kg / 435 lbs because that would put me in a good spot to go either 205 or 207.5 kg.  My second deadlift felt heavy, but I watched it on video before putting in my third attempt.  When I saw how well it went up, 207.5 kg was immediately put on my attempt card.

At this point, hit an all-time squat PR, was on track with all my goals (actually, ahead on squat and bench), the good friend I was coaching went 8/9 and hit a 340ish Wilks in her first meet, my old college coach was lifting in the next flight doing pretty well, and I had lifted at this meet 3 years ago as my first full meet.  Since that meet three years ago, got a nice job doing software engineering, and so on.  To sum up the next several minutes, etc.  I gave a good first pump on seeing 3 white lights and walked back to my chair to grab my stuff

##Post-Meet##

My next meet will be USAPL Raw Nationals in July so long as I’m not injured, or 2014 Arnolds, I don’t know.  I have a good idea of what I would like to do for my next training cycle and how it will be structured.  I won’t really go into detail here (though I have mentioned it to I think two or three people in total) because I find I do better if I use a, “do first, talk later” approach and I want to make sure that I bring my A-game at Raw Nationals, this was just a dress rehearsal.  I will say that I will be incorporating direct hypertrophy training and actual conditioning and mobility specific days.

I run 70sBig.com and am an avid redditor

I was reviewing the FAQ to see that Delavier's ""Strength Training Anatomy, biomechanics, and human movement, there is a special place in my heart reserved for the hate I have for Delavier's 'anatomy' book. 

Sure, but stay focused). More importantly, it's a poor substitute for any relevant analysis of muscular involvement in lifting as well as -- and more importantly -- diagnosing and treating minor to medium grade injuries. 

I explain why anatomy is important for a lifter's mobility [HERE](http://www.70sbig.com/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/)

I had to get this book for school, but you can still find the 3rd edition for under $25 (I recently bought a second copy for $13). Make sure you get the TEXT BOOK, because the work book isn't the same thing. 

Another excellent book, but not as good as one as ""Trail Guide"". It's more of a resource to teach you about anatomy and how it relates to actual human movement. I realize that it would seem Delavier or the standard anatomy guide you have does that...but just trust me, they don't. They aren't even kindergarten or pre-school. They are like a short, thick-nosed neanderthal who just realized he can pull his hair back to style himself while ""Trail Guide"" or ""AWOS"" are like the future alien civilization who is traveling back in time to vaporize citizens of Earth who are ignorant of anatomy. If you have questions on these books, let me know. 

**TL;DR**

Delavier's anatomy book sucks the big one. Please try [""Trail Guide to the Body""](http://www.70sbig.com/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/) (best musculoskeletal anatomy reference and learning how to palpate) or [""Anatomy Without a Scalpel""](http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722) (teaches comprehensive anatomy and how it relates to movement).

Now for the lifts:

Squat- 385 (3 Whites)

Bench- 265 (3 Whites)

Deadlift- 485 (3 Whites)

Powerlifting Total- 1

Here's the deal- I missed weight

By why did I miss weight? Well

Here's what the majority of my diet was like until January 7th:

In n Out double double animal style with animal fries and mexican food. 

And beer... glorious beer. 

Here's what the majority of diet will be like from now on: 

Monday-Saturday: Beef and green vegetables- most likely meatloaf and broccoli throughout the day and then a chicken dish at night. Then I will carb up on Sunday with 2-300g of carbs (aka cheat day). 

I *have* to put my mouth in check. 

My training leading up to the meet was a four-week cycle of my basic template. 

3 reps  @ 85%
2 reps
1 rep

Increase the percentages each week by 2.5% for each. 

Squat on Monday and Friday, such as close grip bench instead of regular grip). After that bang out some 3rd tier assistance work with significantly higher reps. Greater details on my training methods can be read in the .pdf link and linked /r/weightroom post below.

Followed up with a three-week peaking cycle where I did 15+ singles with 85-90% of my 1RM one day of the week for each lift and then 10-15 triples with 75-85% of my 1RM the other training day of the week (for squat and bench.) After that stuff I’d back way off the intensities and work on a mid volume low weight assistance exercise. 

Now for the reason why I have three missed lifts. Plain and simple- **I wasn't strong enough.** 

""Well duh

But here's why: 

- *I ignored technique errors in my squat for consistent increases in volume and intensity*

- *I ignored the weakness on my bench

- *I knew my deadlift lockout was weak and did absolutely nothing about it.*

What I plan to do about it:

- Take a minor de-load on my squat. Focus on keeping my knees out. Increase training volume in order to combat poor movement patterning more quickly while ensuring I maintain better form. This may require slightly I adjust my current training methodology temporarily. Work on mid-top end strength.  I’m also going to be including front and high bar squats a little more often. ([Detailed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13n0j5/the_gzcl_method_for_powerlifting/) and [here **warning .pdf](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/95027848/GZCLBible.pdf)) 

- Blast the hell out of my triceps strength. I missed this weight last year at the Camp Pendleton Open (my first powerlifting meet) and it is the only lift of mine which hasn't gone up 25+ pounds; or really at all for that matter. Floor presses and weighted dips will be stapels of my training for bench assistance work. I have to develop the top end of this lift. I know a 300 pound bench is within my grasp this year. 

- Work on my glute and lower back strength. On that 535 deadlift from the floor to just above my knees flew up. But once it came to locking the thing out- nothing. It got red lighted for hitching; some may disagree with the judges. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is how I’m going to deadlift 600+ as a 148’er. I’m going to start doing some deadlifts with a pause just below the knee (Ala Ben Rice style. Per recommendation from /u/NoMediocrity) and also do some barbell glute bridges. With my glute development work I’m going to continue bulletproofing my lower back with deficit deads, and back extensions. My lower back wont be strong enough until it can single handedly defeat a Marine rifle squad. 

I'm also going to be training as much as I can with Matt Reep (#3 American 165 lb bencher with a 381 raw bench and 1, of which I am grateful for and will be doing as often as possible. I look forward to getting stronger with the lifters up there. 

Overall,200 (My 1,211 counts a 4th attempt which generally isn’t accepted as a “powerlifting total.”) Now, that four pound increase on my total is pretty much negated by my four-pound increase in my body weight.  I came into this meet slightly stronger than I was at IPL Worlds and it really showed me that I’m very capable of having a 1,300 pound total in the next year or so. I also won the 165 pound weight class by default as there were no other competitors who showed up. 

The meet itself ran very smooth and had very little loader and/or spotter error. The judging was generally fair

Special thanks to /u/NoMediocrity, and be my rock- she is the reason why I can train as hard as I do and is therefore the reason why I am strong. I’d also like to thank my buddy Nemo for coming out to cheer me on, you’re the most beastly Asian dude I know and I’m pretty sure you could break Bruce Lee in half. 

Thanks for reading this novel.

TL;DR- Didn’t make weight. Won 165’s by default. ‘Merica.

I started running gzcl's method after reading [this reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13n0j5/the_gzcl_method_for_powerlifting) and [this blog post](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html).  I needed/wanted a new program after stalling hard towards the end of Madcow and after making very little progress with 5/3/1.

---

**Program Overview**

You should definitely read the blog post if you haven't already, and Tier 3 work, with ~10, ~20, and ~30+ reps done in each tier respectively each session.  Tier 1 consists of main lifts only (squat, bench, deadlift, squat/bench/deadlift

The other really nice thing about this program is the ability to schedule everything however the hell you want based on your time and goals.

I set my schedule into 4 week cycles

**Monday**: heavy **squat** day: 

*  5x2

**Tues**: heavy **bench** day

* 3x3

**Wed**: lighter **squat** day (speed work

* 3x3

**Thurs**: volume **bench**

* 5x2

**Friday**: heavy **squat** day

* 9x1

**Saturday**: **deadlift** day

* 3x3

**Sunday**: off

The weights progressed in 4 week cycles for all of the Tier 1 work, 93% in week 3, and 95% in week 4 (there's nothing magical about these percentages, I chose them so that the weight went up at least 5lbs per week and that by the end of the month I was doing a double that I probably wouldn't have gotten at the beginning of the month).  As the weights went up, I'd decrease the weights of the Tier 2/3 work as needed so that I would still recover or decrease the reps a bit.

My Tier 2 work consisted solely of back squats, incline bar press, seated OHP (I have a medical condition that prevents me from doing these standing, namely that I'm 6'5"" and the gym has low ceilings), conventional deadlifts, and sumo deadlifts.  Tier 3 work had even more of the same, plus dips, squat lockouts, so all assistance on Saturdays is more back work: chins, cable rows

---

**Thoughts and changes**

After talking to gzcl, deadlifting Saturday, and doing high volume back work on Wednesday.  I don't think I've had enough back work in my schedule, and while squatting 3x a week was great for a while, I haven't been recovering quite enough lately.

---

**Stats/Diet/sleep/etc**

* stats: 6'5""

* diet: I didn't change the way I eat during this program.  I eat a shitton of meat and dairy (1.5lbs of cottage cheese and oat meal for breakfast today, and that's rarely a problem.

* sleep: usually get ~7 hours a night

**lifts**

* Squat: 365 -&gt; 405

* Bench: 290 - &gt; 305+ (I haven't retested my max this cycle

* Deadlift: 485 -&gt; 525 (failed with 535)

* OHP: 185 -&gt; 200

---

**Tl;Dr: 1140 total to 1235 in 12 weeks with the infallible GZCL method. I have no intention of switching to a different program any time soon.**

1361921129.0,19agq0,NPC (National Physique Committee) Competition Report - Open Bikini Class F,super_luminal,127,16,54,"2 weeks ago I participated in my 3rd competition and took 4th out of 6 in my height class. I finally got the dvd in the mail (what is this 1999?) and ripped the thing and threw it up on youtube

I know we don't see a ton of bodybuilding content in here, so please feel free to comment and ask questions. 

**Training** - I train on a team of Physique, we're in small groups (2 or 4 of us grouped by strength, usually) and do an upper body/lower body split. We tend to do a ton of reps 12-25 and often have assistance/do negatives/do drop sets when we reach failure. The days I train by myself I follow 5/3/1 with assistance that mirrors what I do with the team- lots of glute/ham/shoulder work at ~15 reps. I dubbed it 5/3/1 Bikini. I do cardio, but not tons- it turns into more as I get depleted close to the show because my heart rate slows dramatically. The cardio that used to take 20 minutes can take 40.  

**Diet** - This is the biggie and takes a ton of discipline. I love going to lift, it takes a stupid amount of discipline to exist in a world full of free donuts, shared pizzas, and pitchers of beer. I eat constantly and my meals are between 200 and 400 calories a piece. I get over 200g of protein per day. Necessarily I eat ""clean."" Hate the term, but really, it just means I can't add ""stuff"" when every calorie counts and most of those calories have to be protein. Another way of looking at it is that what fits my macros is chicken, spinach and a nibble of sweet potato- not Haagen-Dazs (sadly). As comp prep goes on, protein always staying at the same level and fats and carbs getting ratcheted down.

**Show prep** - Prepping for a show usually takes about 6-8 weeks if you've been training hard consistently. This show I needed 6 weeks and all that it means when I go from off-season mode to on-season is that I turn up the cardio to 2 x per day

**Day of** - A bodybuilding show generally has Men's Physique and Bodybuilding and Women's Bikini, not a lot of competitors at this level anymore) which are all judged by their own criteria. Bikini and Physique are still pretty new categories and suffer a little bit from inconsistent judging as everyone gets comfortable with the new standards. Ex: some judges like super stick skinny bikini competitors, some like meatier, more muscular ones. Women's categories are broken into height classes, I am in the tallest class, Open Bikini F for women over 18 years of age and over 5'7"" (my NPC card says I am 5'7.5""). Next year I will qualify for Master's 35+ division, though I will still compete against the whippersnappers in Open.

I went into this show feeling a lot better about my physique than my previous 2 shows- the last one being 6 months ago. Prep was easier, lack of libido, and other BS that comes along with show prep, so I could better filter what came out of my mouth during this period (is this something that would normally piss you off? y/n? n? keep mouth shut.). Once I saw the pictures though, I was really disappointed in my glutes. Was I having a bad ass-day? Did it really *look* like that. Then I got the video yesterday. Yeah, it looks terrible. All that work to lift and perkify and my butt looks flat sad and downtrodden next to the rest of the competition and what a bikini booty is supposed to look like. I wrote to the judges and my assessment was correct, my glutes need tightening, and you can't build when you're cutting

*Meet PRs in squat, and total*

##The Longer Version##

So, I had found Wild Iron Gym was going to be putting on a USPA meet about a month after I found it, so I chose that one.

I decided to stay at 132 because cutting down to 123 (even with 24 hr weigh-in) would not only be difficult, so not a big drop, but it could come in handy for a 2 hr weigh in).  After weigh-ins I headed up to San Francisco to meet up with Abes and RedAnarchist for some BBQ and seeing SF.  Let me just stop right here and just say how fucking awesome these two guys are.  I get in and they're making sure I'm eating and drinking and having a good time all day.  Abes shows me around the SF, see some cool stuff, shoot the shit on anything and everything strength related, just had a fucking blast.  The only downside was that we both got rather ill (I puked a tad on Saturday and he on Saturday/Sunday and went to the hospital) which I blame on the BBQ place.

I didn't get a *great* amount of sleep Saturday night (woke up a few times feeling like I was going to puke) but I was up around 7:15am to pound down a pop-tart and Reese's peanut butter cup sandwich (it's exactly what it sounds like) and a box or two of Hello Pandas because I was unable to get any more volume of food or drink (and thus I had to abandon my plan to have breakfast at the nearby IHOP).

I arrived at Wild Iron Gym just around 8:30am and was there in time for the rules meeting (never lifted in USPA before and I didn't want to miss warm-ups) which went nice and quick.  Warm-ups for squats were interesting.  135 felt easy, 275 was heavy, and I thought I squatted 305 high because it felt easy.  I opened with 147.5 kg / 325 lbs and it was 3 white lights - felt fine.  I bumped my 2nd attempt to 157.5 kg for a nice 10 kg increase (347 lbs).  I was more relaxed for that squat as I had a squat on the board.  It didn't feel light, but it felt smooth and with that I put in 167.5 kg / 369 lbs for my 3rd attempt.  In hind-sight I should have listened to a few other people and gone heavier because while my 3rd attempt wasn't lightning fast, there was plenty more left in me if I wanted to do a grinder.  Oh well.

Bench warm-ups felt pretty heavy starting around 135, so I settled with 236.  I think I made the perfect call because 236 felt heavy and my left side was a bit slower but I was able to get the even lockout and thus another good lift, 3 white lights.

At this point I'm 6/6, you read that right, I forgot my belt in my excitement.  Oh well, at least that's not a mistake I'll be making any time soon!  I won best open raw lifter so that was cool.

##Lessons Learned At This Meet##

* For me, just do another single that's less than your first attempt to stay warm.
* I need to push harder on my squat attempts at my next meet.
* Giving back to the sport is awesome.  There was a new collegiate team (SJSU) lifting there and I was able to give a bunch of meet and training advice to a large crew of college kids throughout the meet and it felt fucking incredible to give back.  If I ever got the chance to be a handler for a lifter at a meet
* No matter what level you lift at

##What's Next##

My next training cycle is to focus first and foremost on weaknesses I have avoided addressing for some time, no pulling from the floor).  I also need to bring up my glutes and hamstrings to the level my quads are at, so I will making good use of RDLs and GHRs.  As for bench, I used to be weak off the chest and now I am weak at lockout so I'll spend some time with the Slingshot to get some overload work in (I train alone so it's much less hassle than boards, bands, or chains).  To make sure my chest strength doesn't degrade I'll be doing my warm-ups as paused reps.  For OHP, I like where it's at and where it's going, but I have unnecessary fat for the weight-classes I compete it.  I need to get down to the 123s again before filling out for the new 59kg/130lb IPF weight class.

* [Next Training Cycle](http://i.imgur.com/DUihG.png)

I'll probably do another meet in some time between mid-December and mid-January to assess how my custom program worked and then prep for 2013 USAPL Raw Nationals.

##Thanks##

* Wild Iron Gym did a hell of a great job putting on the meet and I would definitely do another one there if the opportunity arose.
* The spotters had a number of great saves, but that didn't deter them from staying close and making sure the lifter was safe.  Hats off to them.
* A huge thanks to Jacob Rothenberg for taking video, and for pushing me to put in heavier attempts.
* Another huge thanks to Abes, making me feel welcomed, and showing me a great time in San Francisco, I had an absolute blast.  It was great to meet them in person, hang-out, take my mind off the meet, and really enjoy my time there (even despite all the walking - I'm looking at you Red).",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/115q7h/meet_report_san_jose_open_powerlifting/

* **Deadlift**
 - Replace some deadlifts with clean pulls early in your warm-up sets if you suck at exploding at the top / getting hips through.
 - Use a light band anchored in front of you to pull the bar away from you if you need help activating lats to pull the bar into you.
 - If you get up on your toes too often
* **Squats** - Actively think about pushing back into the bar

It is often cast in a negative light and is dismissed as unhelpful or complete bullshit. I personally dissect the concept of broscience into various categories; as I am sure many of you do as well. 

These categories could be defined along the lines of:

- Absolute broscience. For example: ""Bro

- Possible broscience. For example: ""Bro

The reason why I believe *some* broscience to be helpful is because it forces that individual to *actually go and try it.* If it doesn't work

My point is

Now this isn't a defense of broscience nor is it an attack on actual science. However

The important take away from all of this is that before the modern era of computers, men and women were still very strong and very fast. Why? 

Because they went out and tried things. They listend to their peers and applied those lessons learned by those individuals to their own training. Men like [Jim Thorpe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe) and [Hermann Gorner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6rner) didn't have access to fancy training facilities, discarded the trash and kept what was of value. 

Sure they may have been interested in the 'why' or 'how' some of their ideas worked. But what clearly had more value on it was *that it worked.* 

So why did I write all this out? Because it seems that most new lifters now days want to know all the reasons why they should be doing what they're doing. They ask for advice, and even if it had a research paper to back it up, doesn't necessarily mean it would translate well to that new lifter. Just as if there were a research paper to refute it doesn't make that veteran a liar, because it was what worked for him. 

The final point I want to make is directed at the novices in this subreddit. Do not get wrapped up in the microscopic details of your training. Do not concern yourself with all the 'whys' and 'hows' and 'whens.' These subjects will overwhelm you and your training will quickly turn into a quagmire; where progress is slow and painfully frustrating. Focus on your performance. If the bar continues to move as the weights get heavier then the science of your performance matters little.

What matters is that you can perform. ",,t5_2ssmu,False,,vpm1,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y1sco/on_the_value_of_broscience_in_the_gym/

Also there's a ""survey"" which you can put your shirt measurements to help speed along the process.",projekt84,117,25,67,"So this is a problem near and dear to my heart

The idea in a nutshell is to provide clothes for guys who want shirts that aren't too tight in shoulder, actually correctly fit waist (no muffin top), consider certain muscles like traps/lats, and other little things. Pants will accomodate bigger quads/glutes without forcing you to buy bigger waist sizes.

So here's my update I left on /r/swoleacceptance

----

Hey guys

I've gotten a ton of positive feedback from my more fit friends

I currently have the design aspect, and I have singled out a few companies to source production of clothes. I've broken down what the next few months of building up everything will look like in three phases.

***PHASE 1*** - Collect Data

This is where I currently am at. In order to make clothes for guys like us I need accurate data on shirt / pant sizes. Aside from asking friends and friends of friends; My current strategy for this is hitting up random gyms and asking management to allow me to approach members and take their shirt measurements. As you can imagine, and the Internet I'm sure could also help speed up the process.

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R9NZYSD

I've included a survey with this post that just asks for general shirt measurements. If you want you can fill it out (none of the questions are required


http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R9NZYSD


***PHASE 2*** - Kickstarter / Build Base

After I get good enough data to separate into various sizes + fits

The kickstarter campaign will probably be the most important aspect to getting started. 

Once that is started and finished

***PHASE 3*** - Launch

This is the ultimate and final phase. All of the work and kickstarter will lead into the launch where I can start fulfilling orders. This phase is still low on details because I'm busy working on right now!


Oh


-------

So


http://www.kjbeckettbespokeshirts.com/taking-measurements-custom-shirts.htm This is the best guide I've seen for taking measurements

This was the first meet I had to both coach at and lift at in the same day.  In addition to that this was the latest I had ever competed so I think that hurt my performance a little bit.  We didn't weigh in until noon so all I had was some sips of water here and there and a protein shake.  The early session went by fast and even though it wasn't their best day both of them won their weight classes and Meghan took home Best Female Lifter with a 796 total @ 132.  Once the awards were over I got weighed in and unsurprisingly was well below the cut off at 212.  

During warm ups I got saddled with a bunch tall dudes and high bar squatters so the rack height was uncomfortably high.  There were a ton of lifters and we were tight for time so I decided to not adjust the rack height for my warm ups.  This was a retarded decision by me because when I hit my last warm up single of ~460 it was basically a grinder.  I began freaking out (not realizing I was basically high bar squatting) and rushed the the scorers table to change my opener but unfortunately it was too late.  Luckily once I got on the platform everything went better.

**Squat**

Opener - 501.  Easy and deep.  3 Whites.

2nd - 529.  Slower than usual out of the bottom but fairly easy once I got out of the hole.  3 Whites.

3rd - 551.  Holy fuking hell.  It felt like I was under the bar for an eternity.  I had zero pop out of the hole so I had to grind for about 8 seconds before I stood back up.  3 whites.  11lb meet PR.

I started warming up for bench and immediately felt off.  My bench has always sucked but I felt like it had improved enough during this training cycle in order for me to grab at least a small meet PR.

**Bench**

Opener - 275.  Easy as it should be.  3 Whites.

2nd - 292.  Slow but smooth even though my right arm tried to derp.  3 Whites.

3rd - 297.5 I decided to take a conservative jump in order to go 3/3 on bench.  My left arm was basically locked out but my right arm just didn't finish.  3 Reds

Deadlift warm ups felt amazing but at the same time my lower back was tightening up pretty bad.  I knew I had the 220s wrapped up so I decided to make sure that I got a PR total.

**Deadlift**

Opener - 573.  Easy.  3 Whites.

2nd - 600.  Easy

3rd - 617.  Slow but smooth.  I think I could have pulled 623 but I didn't want to risk it.  5lb meet PR to ensure a PR total of 1460.  

**Results**

First place in the 220s and a 17lb meet total PR.  I wasn't very satisfied with my performance as I felt off the whole day but you can't be too disappointed when yo go home with some PRs and a gold medal. 

I finally got drug tested which (as strange as it may sound) was a goal of mine this year.

**Closing Thoughts**

Where do I go from here?  Well obviously Raw Nationals will be my next meet.  I think I've hit my strength ceiling at this body weight so this will be the last time I compete as a 220 in 2013.  I have plenty of room to grow into the 231 class so that should be a fun ride.  I'm going to talk to Mike and hopefully we can figure out something to improve my bench because it's basically crippling my total.  We'll see what some weight gain and plenty of hard training will do.

July 25th marks the 5 year anniversary of the death of strongman Jesse Marunde. Jesse went out as one of the top competitors in the world, but his legacy lives on. His personality and kindness is remembered throughout the strongman community, as well as his deep affection for squatting hard, and so as tribute, competitors everywhere are known for paying respects by completing a ""widowmaker"" set of squats.

Whether you are a seasoned competitor, a ""widowmaker for max"". If you're unfamiliar with what a widowmaker set it, just load the bar to a weight you don't think you can do for 20 reps, and then do 20 reps with it without racking. A general guideline is a 10RM.

The rules:

* All squats must be to parallel. A few high reps will not DQ you as long as the effort is there

* Belt and knee sleeves allowed
Weight classes are mens &lt;175, and HW, and womens &lt;150 and HW. Video of weigh-in to verify.

* Heaviest widowmaker in each class wins.

* Prizes are tentative and TBA

* Video must be taken from an angle that allows us to see depth.
 
* Record a warm up set just to be sure.

* Deadline is 11:59PM Sunday

- 5""9-10 (somewhere in there), female (obviously)
- Training 4-5x a week since …a long time.  Steadily on 531 for the last 3 months, I was working with trainers that were apparently very, very bad.
- Train for powerlifting
- First Powerlifting meet
- 3 years ago
- I've been taking fish oil
- I fell into powerlifting totally by accident as a way to lose weight.  I can credit r/fitness with that although I never read the FAQ.  I had no idea what a deadlift was and was too lazy to actually google it but it sounded super bad ass so I told my trainer I wanted to learn how to do them.  

**Meet Prep**

I first looked into competing in the fall of last year as a way to push myself to do more and progress on my weight loss but I was continually spraining my back due to a good morning incident and then re-injuring it with shitty deadlifting form.  Then there was an incident with my ass.

I've been uninjured since February or so and kind of felt like I was starting from scratch.  I started 531 around that time which was smart.  Very

My weight has been holding steading in the 185-190 range for the last 6 months or so.  This meet was the motivation I needed to start working harder on that.  I'd love to say that it's just an issue of doing the math and calorie restriction but at that weight and the amount of activity I do

**The Lifts**

4/9 on the lifts.  Not amazing but I didn't bomb out and that's the important thing.  Also

**Squat**

- 75kg - nerves completely fucked me.  When I stepped back
- 75 - this one was properly positioned but I was a tad too high.  I can see it in the photos now.  
- 75 - got down to the position in the second

**Bench**

- 45kg - this was supposed to be 47.5kg but after being humbled on my squat
- 47.5 - I was completely in the wrong position.  I got told that I bench like a body builder.  I'm not sure what that means but I've been neglecting my bench.  My arch is tiny
- 47.5 - same issue. 

**Deadlift**

- 97.5g - this was extremely hard and extremely slow to go up.  When I saw the video between lifts
- 100kg - Taking some very sage advice
- 102.5kg - I'm really mad at myself on this one.  It went half way up and gave up because I was feeling a bit defeated by the whole meet at that point.  It should have gone up and it would have been a 2lb PR.

**Results**

I didn't bomb

**Records**

Hahahaha.  No.

**Final Thoughts**

- On my two hour drive home
- I was really aiming to be under 80kilos in weight and was disappointed that didn't happen.  However, of course, not do a squat morning.
- I've decided to try and make the lower weight class for a meet in August.  This will require me to lose 19lbs which doesn't seem like a lot but given that I'm not losing unless I'm eating 1200 cal a day
- I bled all over the bar in my warm up deadlifts and learned that pants should always be worn in warm ups for a meet.
- I need to focus more on the lifts themselves than focussing on trying not to fuck up because that
- I am trying to remind myself that just showing up is the success here and failure was being too scared or apathetic to try.
- Powerlifters truly are the most support human beings on the planet.  The spotters were constantly shouting at me during every lift and that was awesome.  And helpful.

I had two amazing coaches who tirelessly trained me in their home and for that

And I have to give some shout outs to people here:  triplewithcheese whose deadlift advice saved my second attempt.  KomradeKettlebell who, tangy and the rest for being great at what they do and aside from being genuinely encouraging, make me strive to lift heavier by their own posted lifts.  A special shout out to seppy who fed me during this meet.  And yes, it did stick to me teeth but it was delish.

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/exJ0p)  The last one was the 102.5 deadliest that only went up half way.  There are videos (of the ugliest squat morning you've ever seen in your life but they're on someone's phone so just take my word for it.

* I found this program much easier to follow in general. Jim warns about recovery and the need to eat, so this program rocked. YMMV**

* Originally my accessory work varied every day in the 6-day cycle, by the end of the program, I was doing one kind of accessory work for upper body and one kind of accessory work for lower body days - each addressing whatever weakness I had at the time. **LESSON: variety doesn't matter. Efficacy of exercise selection matters, and that comes through experimentation to see what exercises work for you.**

**The results:**

START

205 lbs bw

195 OHP

280 Bench

370 squat

435 deadlift

FINISH

215 lbs bw

195 OHP

300 Bench

380 squat (no belt)

465 deadlift (no belt)

I don't know how I feel about this. My OHP apparently didn't increase, and this was 380 no belt, definitely below parallel. I'll chalk it up to a win, but when you see the strength relativity chart, it's clearly my weakest lift.

**The Assessment:** [view here](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_much_can_you_lift_wimp)

You can check my last post on the details of this assessment

* Hang clean and jerk have been removed. They're just going to be weak because I'm not an Olympic lifter so I see no reason to try and hit a 1RM in a lift I am not trained well in and risk injury. No thanks.

* Last time I did 5RM, so I dropped them. The overhead DB tricep extension comes to mind. Apparently I would need a 160 lb DB, which I don't have, and even if I did, the ROM limit based on the size of the dumbbell would effectively make it useless.

* Why is there a Bulgarian squat and a split-squat test? Fuck that

* I don't get this shit with the calf raises and 1 DB single-leg RDL. These seemed WAY too easy. It's not explained very well what 1 DB means...1 DB both legs? 1 DB 1 leg? I did a single leg RDL with 75s in both hands and that was hard...but on the site he says 1 DB? Seems weird.

* Curls. The curl measurements are fucking asinine. So I went onto the Raw Powerlifting standards charts, I actually have *way* stronger biceps than I thought I did. Certainly focusing on them over the last 2+ months helped, and it shows. Now I've got to bring my triceps up to par!

**IN CONCLUSION:**

I like 5/3/1 Frequency Project. A lot. I think this will be my standard off-season template. It works

* **If you focus on a muscle, you have to make sure to constantly re-assess so you can bring up the newest weak link. In my case, it is the squat, which is why I'm going to be running a Smolov base cycle, followed by Coan Phillipi because I would like a 500 lb deadlift for my meet, so I've got some serious poundage to add there.

* Frequency definitely works for me. Stick with what you know.

* Some exercises target unexpected areas. When the bottom of my squat was the sticking point, hip thrusts (single and double-leg), good mornings. You know what worked best? *bulgarian split squats*. WHO KNEW?! Sometimes you gotta mix it up so much until you feel the soreness where you need it.

* I'm at the point where off-season training needs frequency combined with targeted accessory work on whatever my sticking point is. Right now that's my shoulders/tris and just squatting way more (hence Smolov).

* This is my first time trying specialized programs specifically for a lift. It's exciting but also intimidating to be at a point where my strength needs to be specialized.

**A brief blurb on nutrition:** Cause everyone is going to ask...I did gain more weight than before in less of a time span. I attribute this to the fact that every day was a workout, it's going to require drastic measures (adding heavy cream to shakes, olive oil shots, eating peanut butter when bored). Plus I don't know if my pants will like me...everything is starting to not fit. I'm definitely capping my gains off at 220 if possible. So basically, eat until you fucking hate yourself. Then eat some more. No I'm not tracking anything because at this point, the only way I can gain weight is to just eat even when I'm not hungry, and just fucking eat always. Ugh.

**TLDR: 5/3/1 Frequency Project is great and also works. It's my favorite program for off-season training and I would highly recommend it if you also dig high-frequency workouts.**

* Squat: 300

* Bench: 220

* DL: 365

1010 lbs @ 195 lbs (295 wilks) (height -- 6'2""

**Background**

First stepped foot in a weight room about 18 months ago. Been training consistently since then

**Prep**

Everyone says you aren't supposed to cut weight for your first meet

**The Meet**

* Squat: felt moderately heavy warming up, to 315, which felt a little easier. Then I tried for a +5 PR, which also wasn't too hard. The 300 felt hardest of all, which probably means I'm terrible at warming up.

* Bench: I wasn't sure how my gym lifts would translate to meet. I always do paused benching

* DL: Opener at 365 felt easy so I went straight to 425 to tie my gym PR. That felt very heavy

**Thoughts**

For a first meet

Highlight: a 14 year old

**Thanks**

1333167034.0,rlzpo,What weightlifting shoes are and aren't,Magnusson,102,15,92,"I have been meaning to write this post for awhile because I see a lot of confusion every time the subject of lifting footwear comes up.  

[This is what weightlifting shoes](http://www.roguefitness.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/d/o/dowin-4_1.jpg) look like. Other shoes that some people wear while lifting
   
Weightlifting shoes generally have the following features:
 
* Non-compressible sole
* Metatarsal strap
* Raised heel
 
I've noticed that some people tend to think that barefoot is the best way to be and so the best lifting shoe is the one that is most like no shoe at all. I would argue that unless you are specifically training for some kind of barefoot competition, and effective training. This is why we spend most of our time lifting specialized implements like barbells and dumbbells, even if we’re not training specifically to lift those objects – they allow us to train effectively. Shoes are the same way.
   
The sole and strap in a weightlifting shoe provide stability and efficient transfer of force to the ground to a much greater extent than something like Chucks. Chucks don’t hinder your lifting the way running shoes do
 
As explained in the first article above, which are no longer made, but the [Adidas powerlift trainers](http://www.roguefitness.com/adidas-weightlifting-shoes.php) are supposed to be similar). Rippetoe says in Starting Strength that a pair of weightlifting shoes is one of the best investments you can make in your lifting. I see a lot of form checks with problems that would be improved by a good pair of shoes, so look around and consider trying a pair.",,False,,False,t3_rlzpo

**The program**

* 4 days of low carb
* Very specific type of full-body weight workouts
* Optional cardio.
* It allows almost no flexibility and should only be done by those that have complete control over their diets/training.

*****

**What I did**

* Hit all macros almost perfectly. If I went out
* I did front squats for depletion the first week. Horrible idea and I do not recommend anyone do this. 
* I had to join two gyms with ""trial"" memberships to get access to the necessary machines. Possible with compound-only movements? Yeah
* Depletion workouts always sucked more than anything I've ever done. The first week was easily the worst though. 
* I used the optional EC
* Hit records
* Hurt my back in the third week putting away plates
* I did cardio once in the last week. In the future

**Would I do it again?**

Probably. Yeah. It's the workouts I disliked

**Would I recommend you buy the book?**

Yes. I found myself referencing it a hundred times over.

* Started lifting 6 months ago using Starting Strength. Switched to something Texas Method-y about a month and a half ago
* Take fish oil, a multivitamin, and whey protein powder.
* Nothing special about my diet - I try to get plenty of protein
* Swam and ran cross country in 5th-7th grade


**Meet Prep**

I found this meet browsing [PowerliftingWatch](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/). I did a bunch of research

I wanted to hit the 123lb weight class (I was about 126lbs) so I started slowly dropping calories and cutting out junk food a month out. I was generally weighing in under 123 the week of the weigh-in

My program has a weekly ""taper"" built in


**The Lifts**

I was surprised at how well I lifted - I guess the adrenaline was really helping. My previous PRs only added up to 470 so this was a big jump for me.

I did all my openers at weights I wasn't worried at all about hitting so I could focus on following commands and getting used to the new equipment. That was a great decision.

I ended up making every attempt


**Squat**

* 155 - Went up easy
* 170 - This was my previous PR. It was tougher but it wasn't much of a problem.
* 180 ([video, but they laughed at me and said I should try higher. Glad I did! This was tough, but I bet I could have done 5lbs more.


**Bench**

* 80 - Again
* 90 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC0Wnj5-FU&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - My previous PR. This felt a lot easier than last time I did it.
* 95 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p4iiXDcS9k&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - I've attempted 95 over and over in the gym and failed


**Deadlift**

* 190 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_I5ufoWv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - Easy
* 215
* 230 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNKNGJlxrUg&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - My original plan was to shoot for 225

I was pretty nervous

Log press: 140lb, [170lb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wL38ZrEFM).

180: no lift.

18” deadlift: 360lb, 440lb, 480lb.

500lb: no lift.

[250lb Hussafell stone for distance](http://youtu.be/xqtInFlcpl4): 60 seconds of stressful struggling and then a few steps. Watching the video is quite painful

Grip medley: 100lb grenade pull

250lb rolling handle: no lift.

Got 3rd in my weight class

**Format and failures:**

The log press and 18” deadlift were done in a last-man-standing fashion, I elected to start at the minimum for both log press and the 18” deadlift. Most people entered at higher weights, so I was doing reps fairly quickly, which led me to messing up my log clean at 180lbs and subsequently failing to press it properly. On the 500lb deadlift I neglected to stay on my heels and ended up pitching forward near lockout and losing the lift. 

Though I had a chance to train the log press once before the actual competition at /u/toneguyAK’s gym, meaning they flip under you the second you even try to heft them up. Needless to say, I struggled for an embarrassing minute with the stone before lifting the thing and stumbling a few steps with it, dropping it and yelling “PR!” while walking away. I overthought the approach and attempted to remember cues I saw the other guys doing, but I should’ve gone with my gut and lifted the damn thing, which is how I got it up in the end anyway. By far my weakest event.

Though 170lbs and 480lbs are technically PRs

I’m satisfied with my performance in the grip medley

**Prep:**

I signed up for this thing about three months ago on a whim, deadlifted once and rack pulled at least once every two weeks. I supplemented squats with zercher deadlifts to imitate stone carries (note: this doesn’t work *at all*, lesson learned).

In December 2012 I could strict press 180lbs, and being absolutely paranoid about making weight, started to cut. My overhead strength suffered, but I pulled a 455 PR from the floor two weeks out from the meet. However, I pull primarily sumo and thus my conventional 18” deadlift was barely better than my sumo from the floor. So, that’s something to work on. Long story short, I overdid my cut and ended up 192lbs when I was five days out. After a few emergency (but controlled) sandwiches I weighed in the day of the meet at 194.6 lbs. Weigh-in started 2 hours before the rules meeting

**Lessons learned and future plans:**

Now that I can finally eat without thinking about what I’m putting in my mouth, as well as bringing my overhead press back from the grave of caloric deficits.

I learned more than I thought possible about strongman

Tl;dr: sign up for a meet if you’ve been considering it

I'd like to start this out by saying that this meet wasn't sanctioned by any federations, I decided to give it a shot. The meet was only announced last Friday, the weight classes were weird, the bench press didn't require a pause, chalk wasn't allowed for deadlifts (but I snuck some anyway), I had to walk my squats entirely out of the squat rack because the safety bars were too high for me to hit parallel, and I did all my attempts for each lift one after the other with nobody lifting in between. My body weight was 174, I decided not to try to cut 16 pounds in a week to get to the lower weight class.

My lifts:

Squat: 335

Bench Press: 290

Deadlift: 495

Total: 1180

So I ended up winning not only my weight class, but I have dat deadlift retard strength, and nobody came within 100 pounds of my dead. None of these lifts are close to my PRs (I hit a beautiful 305 paused bench like a month ago, and I've deadlifted 550 and squatted 385 fairly recently), so I was a little disappointed with my performance. I've been generally training like a pussy for the last month or so (and hadn't back squatted in several months due to various injuries), and with only a week's notice that the meet was happening, I didn't really have much time to prepare. Still, so I guess I did okay. I really enjoyed the experience overall and liked being in a competitive atmosphere

I had been training for this meet since Raw Nationals back in August and I believe all the hard work paid off.  I finally strung together a raw elite total in a meet

I learned a lot about myself during the prep for this meet which began back in August, but I got 2 reds on that lift - the head judge gave me a white light, but the 2 side judges gave me reds so I believe it may have been for thigh support, but I can't say 100% because I didn't ask them.

Going forward, increase my conditioning, get back into rowing for cardio, and really work on my flexibility and form.  I also plan on leaning out a bit more (target is 116 lbs) then starting a slow bulk and running some volume programs for squat and bench (I have the 13-week smolov squat program in my sights).

I'd like to give a special shout-out to the FCJ crew for coming out to support me.  They were frickin awesome and cheering at every opportunity.  Even the announcer mentioned that I had a fan club in the crowd

It has now been over 24 hrs since the meet and every part of me hurts, and my head has exploded multiple times from the ridiculous (both good and bad) things and people I have seen at the Expo at the Arnold Sports Festival.  I'll be around to answer any questions if anyone has any.  Thanks for taking time to read this.

For reference to other sports, the oldest victory averaged as age, instead of averaging multiple victories in. 

Some thoughts: What is average age of training start for olympic lifting versus powerlifting and strongman? The latters seem to be something men take up after high school/collegiate athletics

Olympics and IPF is more tested for drugs more than any strongman show. This isn't to say they are cleaner

**Deadlifts**

This one is about as easy as it gets...let go of the bar. That's about it.


**Squat**

Squatting is an intimidating lift for many. A lot of people think that if they fail it will be a big deal

To fail a squat safely, but you want them just below the lowest point the bar will reach. For me, that is about 4 rungs up if I am doing low bar squats with a wide stance. 3 rungs if I am doing high bar oly style squats. The rails end up an inch or two below the bar.

To find the height

Now that the rails are in the right place, and the bar will come over your head with no weight touching you and you will be in the clear. If you fail and are off balance, let the weight fall away from you, dont try to fight it once you lost that balance, just dump it and get out of it's way. The metal rails are much stronger than you, let them take the hit.

**Bench**

There are a couple of ways to fail out of a bench.

On the regular benches at my gym there are a set of catches below the spot the bar normally sits. You can see the in [this](http://www.fitness-equipment.com/acatalog/9512c.jpg) pic (this isn't the same bench

If I couldn't the weight to even that point (this means something REALLY bad happened as I would need to either be injured at this point or I was being REALLY stupid) I would lower the bar to my chest and either roll of shame it (at a high weight, I could just hold it on my chest and call out for a spot, and likely somone would come.

If I was really pushing my self, I would just drop the weight, the rails would catch it, I would lay flat and slide out.

**Overhead Press**

This is another easy fail. I OHP in a power rack, if I fail, I can drop them on there. But the reality is, in every failed attempted, I just lower it to the bottom of the lift and rerack the weight. No fuss about it. The rails are there in case I injure myself badly and can't control the weight.

Obviously incorporating leg drive into the bench is the goal when trying to lift the maximum amount of weight. But as Jennifer attested, will improve the bench press as well.

I'm wondering if there is any *relative* metric for comparing a powerlifting bench press (i.e. using leg drive) to a bench without leg drive. Should you be able to bench 80% of your max without using leg drive? Maybe 65-75%? I also understand that the severity of the arching will effect this metric as well. For example

I apologize in advance if this has been addressed previously or elsewhere (search for anything with ""leg drive"" just brings up articles talking about how to incorporate it) and I just can't find it.

This is *not* OK. That some elite lifters do it some of the time does not excuse *you*.

**The Squat vs the Clean receive**

Part of the confusion comes from the fact that in clean receives, we are aiming to preserve as much leg strength as possible for the jerk. The clean is already very taxing on the legs; and most C&amp;J attempts fail on the jerk. It is critical to preserve as much power as possible.

The squat, in my opinion, not fully squatting.

1318858192.0,lf3d5,"Oly lifter, Y U NO DEADLIFT?",jacques_chester,79,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/lf3d5/oly_lifter_y_u_no_deadlift/

I should preface my comments by pointing out that like every field of human endeavour, there are always disagreements. 

For example, do rotate the bench press into the mix from time to time.

But to forswear deadlifting? What madness is this? Why O Why would an Oly lifter give up deadlifting?

Here's three reasons why.

**Pattern Interference**

The big reason is: deadlifts are similar enough to cleans to cause motor pattern interference

In my personal case, but it must eventually become a fluid, barely conscious effort. Frequent deadlifting interferes with that.

Plus the mechanics of the deadlift are different. A powerlifter will optimise their starting position differently. For an Oly lifter the goal is to bring the bar smoothly past the knee while retaining a constant back angle and keeping the weight over the heel. And that's all. Shortening the bar travel distance

When I first read Rippetoe's chapter in SS on deadlifts

**Maximal Force vs Rate of Force Development**

The next difference between deadlifting and cleans or snatches is that at the high level

At an elite level, powerlifters are stronger than weightlifters, end of discussion.

But limit strength is not the ultimate adaptive aim of the weightlifter. What we require is the ability to produce as much force as possible in the shortest time possible. That's power

You can't grind up a snatch. Either you impart enough momentum to the bar on the correct vector or you don't. There is

Not that limit strength is worthless. Limit strength can, having a well-developed RFD can improve the expression of limit strength. If you can reach your max force output in less time, you are less likely to fail a max-effort deadlift due to running out of energy in the sarcomeres.

But ultimately, but they will need time to catch up on limit strength. The highest-ranked weightlifters cannot deadlift as much as the highest-ranked powerlifters, and that's OK.

**There Are Better Alternatives**

Finally

I don't mean ""better for all purposes"". For a powerlifter

But for Oly lifting

*Pulls*

The most important of these are the pulls. The clean pull and the snatch pull simulate a snatch or clean up to the beginning of the third pull -- ie

Not only do pulls develop strength and power through the positions

*RDLs*

I've written [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kleur/some_words_about_the_romanian_deadlift/) about the magical back-strength properties of the RDL. It really kicks a hundred kinds of butt and no serious strength trainee should leave it out of their overall program.

For an Oly lifter

1. Back rigidity under dynamic load. The deadlift does this too
2. Sweeping the bar back. Properly performed RDLs require you to constantly pull the bar towards you

The hamstring effects are really not the goal for an Oly lifter. It's nice and all that

*Deadlift partials*

Sometimes it's useful to train the two classic deadlift partials. Knee-stopped deadlifts are great for training back tightness in the first pull and developing comfort with pull heavy weight off the ground while losing the little voice that says ""holy fuck that's heavy""

Rack pulls are good for useful for developing an aggressive second pull with supermaximal weight. It's useful as an occasional alternative to cleans or snatches from the knee or mid-thigh.

*An aside on grip work*

Oly lifters generally don't need grip endurance. We need to be able to resist the hand opening for maybe 2 seconds tops. And oddly enough, it actually loosens the forearm muscles.

Go ahead

The practical upshot is that when Oly lifters do RDLs, we break out the straps. We don't want the systemic stimulus to be constrained by the ability  of our forearms to keep a fist closed for a minute or two, and using the hook grip with heavy weights for a long time is a great way to kill nerves in the thumb (hint: not awesome).

Keep in mind that it just came out three days ago so I haven't had the time to go over each page in excruciating detail.

[Non-affiliate Amazon link to the book](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supple-Leopard-Preventing-Performance/dp/1936608588)

It's 400 pages of condensed fucking awesome. 

The $40 cost is hefty but the money is put to good use. The hardcover binding and paper quality are very good and there's only a handful of pages in the book without a picture or illustration of some kind. The language used strikes a good balance between lay person and technical without sacrificing too much in the process.

The opening sections deal with neutral positioning for every joint in the body with various positions and drills that I can see being an immense help to someone just starting with no idea what a 'neutral spine' or 'collapsed arch' is. 

The meat of the book is divided between the movement categories and joint and muscle mobility. Exercises are divided into three categories based on movement skills. This includes proper technique

The joint by joint and muscle by muscle mobility section is extremely well done. I wasn't sure how well the . The picture demonstrations are taken from the right angles and each position of the mobs has an explanation. There's a little primer in the beginning detailing all the equipment used but with just a heavy band and lacrosse ball you can do about 85% of the mobs in the book.

Right now the biggest complaint that I can see is that there's really no integration with the MobilityWOD page. It gets a mention in the intro of the book and the last page is dedicated to it and that's about it. For visual learners like myself this is a big negative and given the haphazard nature the site and Youtube page are organized in it's going to take some serious Google Fu to find the stretch you're looking for even with the proper name.

I want to ask you the following question:
**Do you think it's a good idea to try and learn the big lifts (bench, press) on your own?**

The reason I'm asking: I've been lifting in a commercial gym for maybe six months and the mentality there is that beginners should do a split routine using 90% machines from the get go. However I'm way more interested in the bigger movements which provide more than just mirror muscles. Since it seems to me that the coaches there have no real interest in teaching the complicated free-weight lifts (and think that people should be doing machine exercises) I got myself a copy of Starting Strength

But - without someone to coach me hands on - is it a good idea to try and figure out how to do the big lifts or will it do more harm than good (i.e. injuries

Background and Training
I've been competing in strongman for years and recently switched to powerlifting. I used the Cube method for 10 weeks then did a meet on 4/7. The accident with my daughter happened on 4/10 so I flew out to Albuquerque to be with her. We got home on 4/21 and I only trained twice before the event.

Gender: Male

BW: Walk around @ 170

Experience: Been powerlifting 7 years

Squat: First attempt: 363. Easy Peasy. I was completely relaxed all day

Second: 403 - Matched my PR on squat. This one felt great as well. Afterwards, went over to the booth, and picked out 418 for me. I'm glad he did, because I could barely think at all in the 30 seconds after this lift. 

Third: I dropped, and I hit it. It felt awesome. Squats are my strongest lift, and I was 50 pounds up! Talking to the other 5-6 165ers, I knew winning  the 165s would be a lot tougher than I thought. A guy drove in from Tennesee(hit 373) and another from NC(hit 373 as well) - so they were tough competition and had impressive openers for the other two lifts

Bench: 220

Second: I picked 238, didnt grind. 

Third: Picked 248 over 243. I felt good about the 10 pound jump. I missed this, I pushed myself. My competitors got 248(both of them), making me 33 pounds up going into deadlift.

Deadlift: First: 455. This was fairly easy. I spend about 15 seconds adjusting my hands. I did sumo. Felt great and easy. My competitors did 440 and 485 respectively.

Second: I did 496, but my two friends convinced me I should go for winning the competition. A failed 535 would give me neither the record, nor the competition. I picked 513 for my second attempt, forcing them both to hit 546 to beat me. They hit 496 and 506 respectively on their second lifts, making me 23 and 33 pounds up, respectively.

Third attempt: My competitiors picked 523 and 513 for their third lifts, but I would have had a better chance. I wish I hadn't known what my competitors had chosen. Next time I'll try not to know. They hit 523 and 513 respectively, and I won by 6 pounds, and 16 pounds. Good for them!! 


Recap: I hit PRs, and I went for the victory rather than the ego-satisfying state record. I'm glad I did. Competiting was really fun, and I look to do it again.

Next Meet: August 10

I personally believe continual maintenance of muscle and connective tissue to be necessary to stay injury free and continue lifting with proper mechanics. For this I've found [Mobilitywod.com](http://mobilitywod.com) to be invaluable. Kelly Starrett is a mobility genius. He tends to spew lots of babble and talks really fast but what's important are the exercises and approaches to mobility he teaches.

The majority of the mobs can be done with the following pieces of equipment:

* Lacrosse balls (tennis ball works in a pinch)
* Jump-stretch band
* Something to anchor the band overhead and near the ground (I use a pullup bar for overhead work and my bed posts for ground work)
* Foam roller 
* Occasionally he'll use a barbell to mash some shoulder tissue or a kettlebell/weight as an anchor

Here are some examples of Mobs:

* Two I do everytime I lift to [Loosen up my shoulders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eveYJP1indI&amp;feature=player_embedded) and [Open up my hips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHzXF-mVjY&amp;feature=youtu.be)
* [Fix a jacked up Front Squat/Clean rack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=RmTk_d6MtTk)
* [More hip maintenance including my nemesis
* [Attacking the hamstrings with a lacrosse ball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtwaPoK-UM)

Tight in a particular area? Search the site and I guarantee you'll find a mob to address your issues. Spend thirty minutes a day doing mobility work and I bet you'll feel better and have better mechanics.

* Rotate the video properly. Your head should be in the top half of the frame for deadlifts
* Full body (foot position is critical in all lifts)
* If you are in a rack
* AT LEAST 3 reps


**Video** 

* Side angle is best for pretty much all lifts
* You and the bar + weights should always be in frame.
* Make sure lighting is good if possible. When it isnt, etc)
* 1 lift per video when possible. You can post multiple videos in a single link, but I do know stuff about squats...so I will watch your squat vids)

**Meet Prep:**

I had a full six months to train for this meet, I sustained a pretty serious back injury that prevented me from doing any of the competition lifts .  Naturally I did not go see a doctor and instead decided to rehab whatever was wrong with my lower back with fish oil, pulling a sled, and reverse hypers.  It worked out well and towards the end of November I could front squat pain free upwards of 95% of my 1RM ; however I still couldn't low bar 95lbs.  Bench pressing was also a no-go, but about a month after the incident of only doing dips I started floor pressing regularly and worked my way back up to higher intensities.  That continued until about mid December and ultimately my floor press maxed out at 260 (equal to my bench max) and front squats got up to 350.

Finally in mid December I low barred 405 on a whim fairly easily but really felt it the next day and decided it wasn't meant to be yet.  Enter the high bar squat.  Despite its inherent evils, made up the majority of my training as I pushed my high bar max up to 440, just shy of my then meet PR, through mid January.  At the same time, I found I could deadlift pain free and started ramping up the intensity until I hit a [520 deficit deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMtF9WYXp4) and a [550 deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpe7b-lx-fQ).  At that time my back could finally handle sustained low bar squatting and competition style bench press.  

Considering how my squat had stalled prior to my injury, but for somebody who was used to doing singles, it was pretty freaking hard.  

That continued until about a month and a half out from competition where I then transitioned to more of an intensification cycle with a similar number of sets, so the early mornings coupled with the late nights really did a number on me that week.  On the bright side, I was down to 160 the day of weigh ins without cutting because I didn't have time to eat.  

**Meet Day:**

Definitely felt the week lay-off I took.  Everything on my back past 315 felt twice as heavy as normal, Jack3d, also helped.  Just based on my force-velocity curve for squats, everything past a certain weight looks like the same speed despite the weight.  Thus the relatively smooth looking 457 in the video, but the 468 I called for on my third going absolutely nowhere.  

408

Bench...meh.  Volume training really didn't seem to do anything for me and it was just a so-so day but the weights felt good.

231

Deadlift felt freaking awesome on warm ups.  Everything was fast and strong.  I am really used to Eleiko bars though and the Texas Deadlift Bars really tore up my hands (first world problems...).  My opener felt strong as shit but it ripped a bunch of skin off my thumbs.  I taped up for my second attempt at 551 and got to about the knees before the tape ripped.  Holy mother of god, packed the holes in my thumbs with chalk and pulled that son of a bitch to lockout.

496

**Thoughts Going Forward:**

It would have been the bee's knees to total 1300, 1267 at 165 is good enough to qualify as Candidate for Master of Sport according to the Sheiko guy, so that's pretty neat.  475 on squat and 570 on deadlift are the two big training goals of this next cycle and I do think they are attainable.  I'm not sure what the plan for bench is yet, but I'll figure something out.  Given how well my squat and deadlfit both responded to the quad work I got front squatting (something I think a lot of powerlifters are lacking, myself included), this accumulation cycle is going to feature a lot of front squats, RFE split squats

As the title indicates, but such is life.

**Background**

I've competed before, excited to actually do a meet with a friend instead of being all forever alone.

I've been ""lifting"" for a few years... I had done SS/some variant of linear progression, fucked around some more, never ate enough, etc. In January 2012 I committed to doing 5/3/1 and did that for most of the year. In the late fall I switched to Steve P.'s Ironsport Strength program. I did Smolov Jr. for my bench leading up to this meet because I had done it before and made good gains. I was really hoping that with getting my weight down and my bench up I could bench bodyweight, but as you'll see it was not in the cards. I think eating at a deficit while running that much volume just... didn't work. Previous gym PRs were 205/115/250. Goals for today were a) make the 123s b) squat 200+ c) bench bodyweight d) deadlift double bodyweight. I achieved half of these.

**Making weight**

I was walking around at 130 about a month ago, which may not sound like much of a deficit for someone my size, but keep in mind I also play roller derby and walk everywhere. Weighed 126 earlier this week. I water loaded all week and then cut carbs late on Thursday, cut water late on Friday. Didn't really mess around with my sodium too much, I suck at tracking shit. Took a hot bath at the hotel Friday night, almost barfed everywhere, and weighed in at 55.8kg.

Then I re-hydrated and shoveled in some carbs at the hotel's unappetizing free breakfast

This was a pretty big meet, etc., but they kept everything moving at a decent pace. There were 2 whole flights of women, which makes me happy.

**The Lifts (lbs/kg)**

*Squats*

* 187/85 no lift (depth)

* 187/85 good

* 198/90 no lift (depth)

*Bench*

* 105/47.5 good

* 115/52.5 good

* 121/55 no lift (just too weak)

*Deadlift*

* 231/105 good

* 248/112.5 no lift (just. wouldn't. budge. ugh)

* 248/112.5 GOOD! double bodyweight :)

**Results**

2nd place in a weight class of 2. ha. She beat me by about 15 lbs? She was really cool and I had a nice time chatting with her. She also got best female lifter!

**What I learned**

Obviously, and the weight is not that hard for me. I made sure to sink it deep for my second. On the third I really thought I hit parallel. Hard to see much in the video, but regardless, I need to be squatting to the judge's standards. I train alone, so this was a huge wake-up call that I NEED to be filming myself more, as awkward as it is.

That second deadlift... deadlifting always takes a lot of patience for me

I was also glad to learn I could cut that weight without losing my strength... I matched my PR's for bench and deadlift, so I feel more confident going forward.

Going forward I am planning to try out /u/gzcl's programming. I really like the flexibility and concept of training to making a goal weight *easy*. I want to clean up my form (especially on squats) and build my confidence by not frequently pushing for a max and missing lifts. Any and all advice is welcome!

Proving Ground Classic

**Preparation:**  I knew my bench was going to suck, I've basically neglected my chest for months just trying to get my shoulder to quit being shitty.  Discovered I could do dumbbell bench without any pain and started working on that about 2 weeks ago.

I had recently pushed my max squat from 250 to 300ish

However, more heavy singles trying to get used to DLing heavy again.

I've weighed 167 ish all week, I set up a ghetto sauna in my hotel room.  I used the method Kroc uses, as outlined by Jamie Lewis on Chaos and Pain.

**The Meet:**  I show up

I ended up in the 2nd flight on squat.  It was my first time squatting with a fat bar

Squat:  250

The 250 and 280 felt easy

Moving on to bench

Bench:  175

The 205 was surprisingly easy

I was in the 3rd flight of deads.  Here

Dead:  375

The 375 was just a peanut



Overall, and 1st place was some manlet who trashed me.

**Mistakes:**  I cut way too goddamn much.  Didn't realize the ghetto sauna was that effective.  Also


**What I learned:**  I need to work on my fucking bench and squat.  My squat depth was crazy deep compared to everybody else

tl;dr  280 S

Been lifting for just over 5 years now, I knew that I needed to cut down to the 165lb weight class in order to even be somewhat competitive. I was also carrying a little extra fat which wasn't helping my wilks out either. Since USAPL Raw Nationals isn't until July 2013, I had plenty of time so I sat around 181lbs bw for a few months and just worked on gaining strength. On February 23, 2013 I competed in a local, unsanctioned meet where I totaled 1200@176.4lbs (445/245/510, bench was not paused). For that meet I was walking around at ~181lbs and tried waterloading for the first time and got to 176.4lbs for the weigh-in.

Right after that meet in February, and I've been able to maintain/gain some strength while on it. I've lost around 10lbs and I'm now around 171-173lbs bodyweight. It took a few weeks to get used to it but now I can work off of 2000 calories a day and still feel pretty damn good as long as I do a massive carb load every 3-5 days.

As far as training goes I train 6-7 days a week doing a Westside style routine. I train at a local barbell club (Dirty Gym


**Meet Prep**

I didn't start tapering for the meet until the Tuesday before. On that Tuesday I cut back a little on the squat volume and assistance work. Wednesday I worked up to my bench opener and hit that for 10 singles

For this meet I had a 24 hour weigh-in and I was walking around at about 171-172lbs, so I figured I would be good by the time I arrived at the weigh-in (40 minute drive) as long as I wore a couple hooded sweatshirts and cranked the heat in my car, *wrong*, I got there and weighed in at 165.8lbs. I then proceeded to throw on my insulated running jacket, 2 hooded sweat shirts with the hoods up, sweat pants, and gloves and then drove around in my car for another 30 minutes with the heat cranked to 90. It got so hot in my car that my phone shut off! It did the trick though and I weighed in at 164lbs afterwards!

Post weigh-in celebration consisted of 2 bottles of pedialyte, dried mango, beef jerky, sweet potato chips, grande mocha from starbucks, and a bunch of other shit throughout the day. Next time I think I may keep this cleaner though because I got some pretty bad indigestion in the middle of the night and some of it carried over into the meet the next day.


**The Lifts**

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlsr_02vtlE)

I currently don't have videos of my first 2 bench attempts


**Squat**

**187.5kg (413.4lbs)

**200kg (440.9lbs)

**205kg (451.9lbs), my hips shot back, and I got stuck.


**Bench**

**107.5kg (237lbs)

**112.5kg (248lbs), but at no point during the lift did I think I was going to fail it.

**115kg (253.5)


**Deadlift**

One of the side judges DID NOT like my deadlifts at all. My guess is because on the side where my grip is supinated my shoulder doesn't look like it is all the way back on the lockout.

**225kg (496lbs), my opener at this meet was over 3x bodyweight and it was incredibly easy.

**232.5kg (512.6lbs)

**237.5kg (523.6lbs), this time it went up smooth!


**Results**

I totaled 550kg (1212.5lbs), so I didn't quite get my goal of 400, but 390 wilks is my goal for Raw Nationals in July since it will qualify me to compete at the Arnolds in 2014. So now I just need *at least* a repeat performance in July.


**Final thoughts**

I thought the meet was very well run. There was only 1 platform and with over 30+ lifters we were done by 3PM or so (it started at 10AM). The judging was pretty strict on things like squat depth

Overall I'm really happy with my performance, high bar, low bar) and I want to see if I'm any stronger with a wider stance. I also want to start doing more squat variations that put an emphasis on strength out of the hole like box squats and pause squats.

1366122095.0,1cgmp9,Experience and lessons learned with my two-a-day program,Cammorak,80,17,16,"**Background**

Trigger Warning: Overly verbose weakling

A few months ago, and I've only been lifting seriously for a bit over a year (with breaks for some dislocated ribs and a hellish month-long illness). Previously, I had some lifting experience, but mostly complexes and metcons as training for martial arts.

Because my schedule was so packed

Not mentioned in the below program was my intermittent attendance of Krav Maga classes

My recovery is generally very good, despite the fact that I was doing my heavy lifting at 4 AM. There were also a few built-in deload days because I did this program from November to January. I may have gotten a little depressed toward the end, but that could have just been my personal situation at the time.

Starting stats:

27 years old, lots of lower back fat)

315/155/385/125

**The Initial Program:**

**Squats (Mon AM)**

*Squat* - Warm up to 3RM

*Good morning

**Back/Broceps (Mon Noon)**

*Pullups* - 5xMAX

*Kroc Rows* - 3xMAXx65 lbs

*Curls* - 5x6

**Conditioning (Tues Noon)**

*Cycle sprints or burpees*

*Ab work* - TRX fallouts

**Press (Wed AM)**

*OHP* - Warm up to 3RM

*Incline bench* - 5x6

**Shoulders/tris (Wed Noon)**

*DB Press* - 5x6

*Dips* - 5xMAX

*Cuban press* - 3x10

**Random bullshit (Thurs Noon)**

*Cycle sprints or burpees*

*Weighted neck bridges*

*Ab work*

**Deadlift (Fri AM)**

*Deads* - Warm up to 3RM

*RDL* - 5x6

**Modifications:**

I have a lot of shoulder issues, bench replaced OHP in the morning and I did a pretty typical benchbro assistance session in the afternoon (DB bench, dips, pushups).

I also put less emphasis on Thursday. When I first started planning the program, I became less invested in my martial arts training and more invested in strength training.

I added in foam rolling

**Results:**

Ran from Nov 2012 to Feb 2013

Weight: 189-&gt;196

Noticeable upper back, shoulder, and quad sweep hypertrophy.

335/200/405/145. Bench is calculated from 5@170 and 2@185

**Comments:**

I'm quite happy with my progress. My upper body had been a weakness for a long time, although that could just be experience and practice talking.

More importantly

Was this optimal? Almost certainly not, and surprisingly, despite only working my bench every other week for 2 months, it still exploded.

I still consider myself relatively weak and very inexperienced, and I'm looking forward to exploring those various hunches more in the future.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,

A question came up last week about hormones and lifting and it got me thinking that while the guys seem to have an unfortunate amount of broscience and hearsay about lifting, we don't even have our own big enough pile of BS to wade through!

From my own experience being scared to death after missing a period after I'd been lifting 3 months and having no one good to ask about it (I went to the doctor when I was sufficiently terrified

So the guiding question of the week is all about asking the (often awkward) questions about women's physiology and how it relates to lifting that you never had a big enough audience of lifting ladies to ask.

The program consists of two bench days a week and is an 8 week program. The lifts are based on your current max lift.

Day 1 will look like this:

Week 1: 8 x 8 @ 70%

Week 2: 7 x 7 @ 75%

Week 3: 6 x 6 @ 80%

Week 4: 5 x 5 @ 85%

Week 8: 1 x 1 @ 105%

Day 2:

Week 1-8: 8x1 90% (set x reps)
 
Day 1 should be proper lifts. If you are not used to higher volume you might need reduce the weights somewhat the first weeks and if it is too easy you should of course increase. Day 2 should be focused on explosive lifts and touch n go is perfectly alright here.

**Background**

Started competing in 83kg class July 2012 as a sub junior. Competed in Oceania champs in December in 83 SJ with a 527.5kg total.  

This year I am making my way up to the 93kg class as I have a few years to get comfortable into it as a junior before I expect to be hunting records

I have been sick and had multiple soft tissue issues leading up to this competition, low trap, and pretty much  everything that has anything to do with my pressing ability.  Side note: my bench had been at 130kg since about October 2012 but had not been able to crack 132.5 UNTIL NOW.

I think the soft tissue work went very well and I'm happy to attribute my bench towards that.

My squat had changed technically since December also but still has a few issues which I am addressing but I am happy to have made a 7.5kg PR which didn't look too difficult.

But moving on...

**Training**

Leading up to the competition I wanted to use a higher frequency protocol to get used to the adjusted form for my bench and squat; I thought Skeiko would be a good idea - this thought occurred to me 2 months out.  So I jumped glute first into #31 planning to go onto #32 and be reading to smash PRs.  If you don't know about Skeiko, before other higher volume cycles; but fuck that right?! I'm 18, I'm not some old fart that can't recover between his social tennis games.  So yes, I beat myself the fuck up - probably caused the soft tissue issues that I mentioned earlier, but on the upside, yes, I did dial in my new technical changes

**Making weight**

Nothing to worry about at all


**Squat**

Lifts went well but looking back on the technique I can see that I need more knee travel


**Bench**

My bench work leading up to this comp and the 5 months previous had all been paused.. every. single. rep.  I think this probably gave me the power I now have off the chest but my sticking point it stickier than it should be

**Deadlift**

Felt shit

**Conclusion**

Feel happy with how I went and I look forward to my next competition which will probably just be a local meet in October before Oceania/Commonwealth championships in Auckland in December - which I expect to get fisted at but have a great time in the process ;)",,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1c9fow/meet_report_australian_raw_powerlifting/

This report is mostly a cut and paste from [my silly little tumblr post](http://jevanses.tumblr.com/post/46269194144/usapl-missouri-state-ozark-pling-championships-2013):

**Preface**

This is my 2nd ever meet, I wasn't on much of a program for deadlifts and bench but was working my squats on a lower volume version of [gzcl's protocol](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html).  I did 5 or so cycles of 5/3/1 for bench last year that brought me almost no where, and got injured just after my first attempt at smolov jr, day 1.

**""Making Weight""**

Several weeks out from the meet, almost making the 132-lb class, which is straight-up sorcery.  Sadly rehydration became a problem, and as Rick Fowler got into the pre-meet rules briefing, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up a small fraction of the large quantities of food and pedialyte I stuffed in my face after weigh-in.  I felt better aftewards and was ready to warm up.

**Squats**

Squats are my best lift, it flew up, along with my confidence.  As I locked it out I thought “no fucking problem” and had every bit of confidence with my opener of 107.5 kg = 236 lbs.

Still, baby.  I got mad.  It, too, went up without a problem, and I wrote 122.5 kg as my final attempt with no shortage of giddiness.  I’ve done 255 lbs singles in the gym pretty fatigued, but I was still surprised watching the film by how easy the lift appeared and felt.

Squat number three went up fairly smoothly as well, and other people throughout the meet who approached me just to congratulate me on my squat after the fact, and knowing I finally, *finally* hit my big twice bodyweight milestone, I got pretty emotional.  I decided if the rest of the meet ended up totally fucked, I would still walk out happy.  The meet director exclaimed I had the best squat in my weight class over the loud speakers, beating out total tanks who would go on to destroy me in the bench and deadlift.  That was a very proud moment for me

**Bench**

Back in October and November, but I had a really nice moment the week before the meet where I had no trouble with a 105 lb paused single in the gym.  I knew I could hit that in the meet, and I went for it on my second attempt (47.5 kg).  My third attempt gave me some nerves, as my pre-injury PR was 120 lbs, and I was facing 52.5 kg = 115.7 lbs, just slightly less than how I lifted full-strength.  I’ve never lifted this much with a pause, and I haven’t gone this high since my shoulder’s issues came to light… but I pushed it up.

**Deadlifts**

I don’t really know how to describe to you how deadlifts make me feel.  Before a squat, pushing my shoulders down as my legs push my weight onto my traps.  I can sense how heavy it is before the lift begins.  Perhaps this is the origin of my fear of deadlifts.  The weight sits there, laughing at me, and I have no idea how it will feel.  Sometimes in a squat, 225 lbs feels heavy on my back.  How heavy will this bar feel in my hands?  *cough HTFU cough*.

My opener was alright, pacing around the gym with music blasting in my ears.  I got the weight up but it was no easy feat.  Wanting it badly enough, and thinking I could pump myself enough for it, I put 122.5 kg down as my third attempt.  I wanted to walk out of the meet saying I can squat and deadlift twice my bodyweight.  My brain, my strength, and my fatigue battled each other, and I got the weight up a few inches before realizing it wasn’t going anywhere else but back on the floor.

**Trouble Spots**

I need to work on getting my mind right for deadlifts.  My form work, /r/weightroom, to give me any comments you think that might help).  But the most important factor: **I have to put in the fucking work.**  Guess what I do on squat day?  I go apeshit, putting all of myself and my strength into the lifts to make them as strong and successful as possible.  I don't do a million variations, I just fucking squat, and I get stronger… surprise, surprise.  What do I do on deadlift day?  I get scared.  I need to train them and train them as hard as I squat.  The program I’m on doesn’t even fucking matter.

All in all, meet loads of other awesome lifters, and see a dude squat 900 lbs.  Pretty awesome.  End wall of text.

**Video**

[Some good

**Training**

I decided to do this meet 13 weeks ago because it was only an hour from my house and it's the meet I did last year. My last two meets *(July and Aug 2011)*

Step 1: Grow a beard - nuff said.

Step 2: I knew I would get the most bang for buck on the deadlift since it was equal to my squat and ready to explode

Nods to triplewithcheese, and shortkid for affecting how I would change my training. troublesome commented 6 months ago that I needed more explosiveness so I started to incorporate that and speed work. UTO mentioned first, then shortkid, to try out Sumo deads to help bring up my conventional dead.

Triplewithcheese has Svunted

I'm old and recover slowly, Dead and Row with the schedule looking like the following *(each line is one day)*:

* Heavy Paused Bench and heavy Pendlay Rows
* Heavy Squats
* Speed or Deadstop Bench superset with KB rows and rotating bench grips through wide
* Deadlift variations *(Sumo
* Heavy Paused Bench and heavy Pendlay Rows
* Paused or Anderson squats
* Speed or Deadstop Bench superset with KB rows and rotating bench grips through wide
* Heavy Deadlifts or Rack pulls
* Repeat

For heavy days,3 and then repping out 1-2 sets at 80-90%, trying to increase with the overall trend.

It worked pretty well as I could tell I was gaining in bench and deadlift, so that sucked. I was able to get a 400lb single in my last session when I could barely get 315lbs when I first tried them. I'll be looking forward to using it more.

Additionally

**The Lead Up**

Nursing several muscle strains

I didn't care much about weight as I was floating around 230-235lbs for the entire 3 months and I was not going to cut for this. Also

Saturday night I went to bed early again but with no sleeping pill. Woke up refreshed and feeling good. Weighed 106.1kgs on my scale, 2 raw eggs, creatine and water with some espresso on the side.  I knew this would also clear me out so I didn't have to worry about a BM later. I also had half a jar of PB.

Got my stuff on and drove over to the meet. Weighed in at 106.5kgs a few hours later

**Squats**

The warmup area had 2 racks and 3 platforms. I saw some familiar faces from last year and we all started warming up together. I brought my 20kg KB to help me warmup up with Goblet Squats and Halos for the shoulders.

*Warmups*

* 135 x 3 - HB paused; ATG
* 225 x 3 - HB ATG
* 273 x 3 - LB
* 315 x 1 - LB
* 365 x 1 - LB

Also

*Platform* - PRs in bold

* 182.5kgs/402lbs [][][] - Phew. Nerves fading. I had been worried about depth because I was inconsistent in training but being fresh made it easy to hit. Also
* **202.5kgs/446lbs** [][][] - Went for the small PR over my gym PR and was a slow one but got it.
* **205kgs/452lbs** [][][] - Guy tried to convince me to go for 5kg jump, un-racked and, ""WTF!?"" Immediately unbalanced and I thought I had really missed the mark. Re-racked and they misloaded the bar! Goddammit. I feel it's times like these that it's helpful I'm not one of those super psyched up lifters. It didn't affect my focus much, but still annoying. I got the lift and as I walked off the platform I slapped the guy at the table on the shoulder, ""I probably *did* have 5 more lbs in me..."" and we chuckled together...full homo.

**Bench**

There were two flights so there would be no delay between lifts and only 9 lifters in the second flight

*Warmups*

* 45 x 5 - paused
* 135 x 3 - paused
* 185 x 3 - no pause
* 225 x 1 - paused
* 245 x 1 - paused; this flew up and I felt really good.

*Platform*

* 125kgs/275lbs [][][] - Guy made me really steady the bar before 'Start'; pause was normal; went up easy
* 140kgs/308lbs [x][x][x] - Wah
* 140kgs/308lbs [x][x][x] - Not even close

**Deadlifts**

Starting to feel more mental fatigue at this point than actual fatigue and I really had to catch myself from become blase about the rest of the meet. I had made 32oz of super concentrated coffee the day before and had about 16oz left so I chugged it. I would warmup mostly my CNS here:

*Warmups*

* 135 x 3 - setting movement
* 315 x 1 - waited about 7-8 mins before doing this
* 385 x 1 - same

*Platform*

* 200kgs/441lbs [][][] - Easy peasy.
* **220kgs/485lbs** [][][] - Based on my bench fiasco
* 227.5kgs/501lbs [x][x][x] - Came off the floor easy but died at the knees. I think my mental fatigue did also hurt my physical fatigue here. Looking back I didn't rip it off the floor hard enough to help me through transition; I just kind of pulled it up. It didn't feel OMG heavy

**Total**

So I went 6/9 and 550kgs/1212lb is 70kgs/154lbs more than last year so I'm happy about that. I wanted to get 210kgs/462lbs for squat and with a little in the tank on 3rd I feel good that I was close to that. If I hadn't messed up bench I may have had the confidence to go for 501 on the 2nd DL. Overall I think I left 12.5kg and 7.5kg on the platform with bench and dead

*Lessons Learned*

* The thought of coffee still makes me want to vomit. Too much caffeine too. I was nauseous and had a headache most of the evening and didn't sleep well. Will look for a better intra-meet stim next time.
* WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO YOUR PAST LESSONS FOR BENCH! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Go for the meet PR based on how you feel
* It's pretty nice to have official totals in squats and deadlift since I'm pretty sure my cheapo weights in the basement are not exactly what the weight they say they are.
* I feel my bench training was good even though I choked here. I pressed 315lbs puased recently after doing a PR session with Pendlays right before. That's about a 20lbs increase since 12 weeks ago.
* I gained about 50lbs on my deadlift in 12 weeks. Great success.
* I think the biggest factor is doing all three in one day for the first time since April made it tougher and cost me a few lbs.

I train 4 days per week, dead, press. I follow a general template for each day, something like:

* Main lift

* Big accessory lift

* Small accessory lifts, flyes)

* Band traction or static stretching

I generally vary the main lift from week to week. Squatting for example would be to-a-box with reverse bands

Current challenges include managing recovery (especially back recovery), keeping my hip flexors and glutes in line is a constant concern.

I should probably give my own input - I'm sitting at a 345 paused bench, 335x3 squat, and 365x5 deadlift, at which point I ran a 12-week linear progression meet-peaking program that put me at my current PR's.  Doing some recovery work for the next couple weeks then thinking about doing another 12-week training cycle to hit some new higher numbers.

I feel doing deadlift assistance work has really helped me break through on the lift for once, perhaps banded, and overhead presses as of now).

tl;dr: first meet went well

**Background and Training**

5'4"", switching between volume days (5x3) and heavy PR days. I really had no idea what I was doing but it worked for me for a while. I started Madcow in mid-January after my lifts stalled at 185/105/225 for a couple months. I had difficulty with the weekly progression in everything but the squat. Bench stalled out early and often, deadlift stalled out once after about week 7. Overall I’d say the program was good for my squat and DL, meh for bench. PRs going into the meet were 200/110/240. 

I train in my university gym and the internet is my coach. I frequent /r/weightroom

**Meet Prep**

I chose this meet so that I could train while I studied for Step 1 of my boards (took the exam April 24th). This was possibly the best idea ever—having strictly scheduled

I ran Madcow up until the Saturday before the meet. Monday before the meet I hit my openers to soothe my nerves (don’t think I could have hit them on Saturday if I hadn’t done this) and the Wednesday before I did singles of all 3 lifts at 70%.  I did sort of cut weight for the meet. I wanted to chance to easily go to nationals or IPL worlds if I so desired. I’m normally around 125, and a little water (I normally do IF with a 10 hr eating window so this wasn’t a huge deal). I overshot the weight loss and ended up weighing in at 120.8, then ate a ridiculous amount after weigh in, rehydrated, went to bed, and barely slept due to nerves (oh well). Morning of the meet my intestines were, uh

**The Lifts**
I went 92.5 kg/50 kg/110 kg. Video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gR6sYWndDE&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

SQUAT: 
First attempt—87.5 kg. Make. My legs were shaking and it was harder than it should have been.
Second attempt—92.5 kg. Make. Small 3.5 lb PR. Definitely felt like a PR squat. 
Third attempt—95 kg. No lift. Picked a small increase in weight because of how slow 92.5 kg was. On the way down I thought “oh

BENCH PRESS: 
First attempt—45 kg. Make. Could have repped out 5 of these.
Second attempt—47.5 kg. Make. Still too easy.
Third attempt—50 kg. Make. My breathing got thrown off and the lift was harder than it should have been. This was a weight I’ve pressed in the gym before. It was important to me to get all 3 lifts on bench because it’s my weakest lift and I REALLY wanted all the experience I could get benching under meet conditions. 

DEADLIFT:
First attempt—105 kg. Make. Easy.
Second attempt—110 kg. Make. Easy but slower. Since I weighed in at 120.8 this was my first 2x bodyweight deadlift! It also put me over 300 wilks
Third attempt: 115 kg. No lift—took it to lockout but didn’t do a controlled drop or wait for a command. With the exception of the f' up re: commands this was the best lift of my life. One of those that I would have given up on if I hadn't had a crowd cheering me on. I fought it all the way up, but everyone at the meet was so wonderfully nice to me about it—at this point I honestly just feel bad for reacting so negatively about what truly was an awesome pull. 

**Results**

Total 555.5 lbs at 120.8 lbs for a 301.584 Wilks. Woo! I won my weight class by virtue of being the only one in my weight class

**Thoughts/Future Directions**

Overall a good meet

The other lifters at the meet were AMAZING. People really gave it their all and were so

As far as the next few months go for me

Regarding future PL meets: As I mentioned before I’m a med student. From Sept-Oct I’m doing a surgery rotation so I’ll no longer have weekends free for meets. I will however have a home gym with a squat rack and DL platform (moving in June!). I’m hoping to use what little free time I have then to at least maintain my strength and go to another PL meet in Nov/Dec during my Neuro/Psych rotation.

Thanks for reading my long-winded meet report. I'd love any feedback--I mostly posted this in the hopes of getting thoughts from more experienced lifters

**TLDR:**  
A.S.Prilepin,000 training logs of elite lifters, and derived a system that tells you how many reps and sets to do at a specific intensity level (% of your 1RM) to have optimal strength adaption.

Some other guy came along and created a formula that allows you to calculate the ""work level"" of a whole workout

Using his formula, and sets, but still be able to compare them to one another so you can create ramping progression without it just being a boring linear increase in only one of the 3 variables. This is the basis of most of the percentage-based periodization programs you see, including 5/3/1, sheiko, and westside.

The good part of the PDF is the *INOL of a set formula* on the second to last page

**Weight** - before/after - 173 - didn't change - I only ate about 300 cals more than I previously had on my lifting days.

I currently follow 4 day split 5/3/1 BBB programming.  It has been working great but up until February 16

I only cut back (3x8 deadlifts

Week 1 weight; **Monday** 192.5x6x6, **Saturday** 232.5x10x3.  

I increased this by ten pounds the second week

Week 3 weight; **Monday** 210x6x6, **Saturday** 250x10x3. Completed the 10x3 On March 16.

I decided to go for a rep max not a 1 rep max, I was wrong).  A few other lifts went up as well.  My OHP last cycle peaked at 190x4, this last Wednesday I peaked at 192.5x5(I was not expecting this, I wish I would have taken video!).  My weighted dips also went up 5 pounds.  I was doing 3x10 with 15 pounds hanging.  Yesterday I did 3x10 with 20 pounds hanging and was able to complete the movements with gas in the tank.  

**Conclusion**

The program worked for me.  And not just for my bench but also for a few other upper body compound lifts.  I learned that I have the ability to add more volume into my 5/3/1 routine, I am excited to start running Smolov Jr. for my squat in a few weeks/month.

1334520683.0,sb7m2,[Meet Report] - NHIS Back to Basics Strongman Competition,xtc46,64,7,35,"So for some time I have been looking around for strongman stuff to mess around with. It is something that has always looked bad ass but that I have never had the opportunity to do. Thursday night

**Meet Prep**

I had a full PL meet last weekend

**Day of the meet:**

I'm going to say right now that every single time I show up to a strength sport meet I am blown away by how supportive and friendly everyone is. I walked up, introduced himself and asked if I was competing, I said I was thinking about it, and asked if he was. He said no, he was just helping organize. I asked if he had done it before, he said yea a few time...turns out he has won the Hawaii Strong Man competition for the heavyweights. So ""yea a few times"" is about as humble as it gets. I asked if he thought I should do it, and he said ""just entering is a win. It takes a lot to come out and do this stuff"". I cut a check

I continued to walk around for about an hour looking at the devices, some random guy who showed up out of no where, to help me out. I really appreciated it.

We all met up for the event meetings, showed me how to do some of them during warm-ups, etc. Right before the start, a couple other guys I knew from the PL scene showed up and were competing and they were helping me out too.

This is without a doubt what I love most about powerlifting and strongman. The community of people that do it are a family. At no point have I ever felt looked down on when competing in an event where I was just going to get demolished. 


The day was broken up into 5 events.

**Event 1: Truck Pull** 2nd place

This was funny. When it was time to pull a truck, said that was for the teenagers and I was pulling a cargo truck with trailer. Weight was 33,000lbs.

This event was actually much easier than I had thought, which made this harder than usual (and made using the rope you can pull to help you harder, so both he and I ended up just dropping the rope and trotting with the thing.)

**Farmers Walk** - 2nd place

The 3rd competitor showed up in our weight class for this event, then lost control through the turn, set back up and made it about 3/4 of the way back before the time limit was hit. The pro killed it, the 3rd guy made it only to the turn I believe.

**Log Press** - Tied for last place

My shoulder has been acting up so I was planning on skipping this entirely (I didnt even know it was going to be there). But when it came time, how to do it better in the future what the queues people were saying meant, etc.  It was great.

** Medley** - 2nd place

The medley was as follows:

* Keg Carry - 160lbs keg 60 feet.
* Sled pull - use a 100lb chain to pull a 240lb sled (340lb total) 60 feet
* Run back to the sleds (60 feet)
* Sled Pull - regular sled with a v-bar handle - 250lbs for 100ft

**Yoke Walk** - 2nd place.

Good god. This was hard. Weight on the yoke was 535lbs

course was 60 feet

**Loading Event** - 2nd place

This was another medley of sorts.

* **Put 160lb keg up on a 4ft high platform **- I did this with ease.
* **Lift 235lb atlas stone over a 5 foot bar** - lol no chance. I was able to break the stone from the ground
* **Lift a 250lbs atlast stone over a 5 foot bar** - didnt do as I couldn't get passed the first stone.
* **Throw a 100lb chain onto a 6' platform** - didn't do because of the other stones.

The pro dominated this. He ended up moving 4 stones

**So would I do it again?**

Hands down



There is another strongman even in august (I also have a full PL meet in august I think) so I am going to be busy.

I strongly suggest everyone try this at least once. It was an AMAZING time. I don't regret doing this for a second and would do it again in a heart beat.

Thanks to /u/edubation and /u/threewhilelights for the advice at the last minute. You guys are awesome. And thanks to everyone here and in FCJ, even if you all are just internet people.

Time to re-write my program to include strongman training stuff.

1374552986.0,1iv3us,"[Meet Report] USAPL Raw Nationals - Orlando, FL - 1201 @ 166.1lbs | 386.5 Wilks",desolati0n,69,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1iv3us/meet_report_usapl_raw_nationals_orlando_fl_1201/

So I've been planning on going to this meet for almost a year now after I heard it mentioned on here. At first my only goal was to go to it because I thought it would be awesome to go to a large meet to compete along side of a lot of really strong lifters, which put even more pressure on me. I did a USPA meet in May where I totaled 1212.5@164 which gave me a 394 wilks, so in order to get that 400 I needed to hit some nice PRs on everything.

I was originally planning on competing in the 74kg/163lb weight class

A few weeks out from the meet I started practicing my form again for the competition lifts. I have been mainly high bar/safety bar squatting due to my horrible flexibility giving me bicep issues when low bar squatting, but I recently found out that I haven't been squeezing my glutes while benching which has been causing me to have horrible leg drive and I lose my arch as soon as the weight starts getting heavy. I also found out that I feel much more comfortable benching with a fairly wide-grip (index fingers on the rings) and decided to use this grip for competition.


**Meet Prep**

I started tapering a week out and mainly just worked on hitting my openers. 5 days out I worked up to my opening squat

The Saturday/Sunday before the meet I did a fairly big carb load to make sure that I was competely full

The whole weigh-in process was hectic and incredibly stressful. I originally sent in my registration form months ago and I registered for the 163lb weight class, so instead of showing up 10 minutes before the weigh-in of the 163 class on Friday morning, I showed up about 15-20 minutes before the weigh-in of the 182 class on Saturday morning. The officials at weigh-in/equipment check gave me some crap for it, and I was freaking out worrying that they weren't going to let me lift, but they finally penciled me in. I was also a bit lucky because they weighed-in the people who were penciled in first, so I ended up being the 2nd person to weigh-in which gave me the full 2 hours to rehydrate. I also should mention that the 182 class was MASSIVE. It had 3 flights by itself and they had to delay the start time by a half hour because they couldn't even finish the weigh-ins in the allotted time.

After weigh-in I drank 2 bottles of pedialyte, Gatoraid, Fruity Pebbles, and dried mango throughout the meet. Even though I only waterloaded down to 166lbs and didn't forcibly sweat out any extra water, I still found myself cramping up during the meet; further reinforcing that I'm too heavy to even attempt making the 163lb weight class (w/ a 2 hour weigh-in), unless I want to feel like complete and utter shit while lifting.


**The Lifts**

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PegXpCSWxnE)


**Squat**

Warmups felt amazing for squats, but it made my opening attempt feel much better.

**187.5kg (413.2lbs)

**200kg (440.7lbs)

**205kg (451.7lbs)


**Bench**

I guessed my rack heights at the weigh-in instead of running halfway across the hotel to get them

**107.5kg (236.7lbs)

**112.5kg (248lbs)

**115kg (253.5lbs)


**Deadlift**

Up until this point I was on a roll, going from 496 to 518 to 540. Unfortunately this is where it all fell apart.

**225kg (496lbs)

**235kg (518lbs)

**235kg (518lbs)

So what happened here? I'm not quite sure. There's a couple things that factor into it. This meet was running EXTREMELY late. It didn't start until 2:30pm and I wasn't deadlifting until almost 8pm at night. I was able to get pretty amped up all through squats and bench


**Results**

I didn't do as well as I wanted to and I didn't qualify for the 2014 Arnolds


**Final thoughts/remarks**

I have to give huge props to /u/dedmaker and /u/frostedlard for cheering me on. Dedmaker also gets extra props for being my handler

The announcer and music were HORRIBLE. The announcer almost never called out the weights people were lifting (my family/friends at home watching the livestream didn't even know what the weights were). Just listen to the announcer in the background of my lifts video

So what am I going to do next? I know for sure that I'm done with the 163lb weight class with a 2 hour weigh-in
For my next meet, then I'll probably do it, otherwise not. It was a lot of money to go down there and compete and unless I know for sure that I can get something out of it it's not worth it.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1iv3us/meet_report_usapl_raw_nationals_orlando_fl_1201/

Now, power shrugs, snatch grip deadlifts, snatch shrugs, clean pulls (or shrug pulls, for the old school crowd), etc.

For me, it would cripple my upper/lower back for any sort of overhead work or squatting. I find that pulls really don't have the same effect (though I do tend to get some serious upper back fatigue from doing shrugs for weeks on end).

In my search for great athletes I noticed that *a lot* of throwers do these

He also points out that your pull doesn't need to look the same as everyone else's, he for instance doesn't use hip drive in snatch pulls, so you have to experiment a bit with what you like (and what helps achieve your goals).

**Prep**

A few months out, which ended up taking its toll on my lifts (most especially my deadlift; I hit a fairly easy 500 at 225 but struggled with 480 at the meet). Two weeks out I got a terrible bout of food poisoning and was shitting water for about five days. Believe me, I dropped to sub-198, but I was weak as hell. As soon as I recovered (about a week before), I went no-holds-barred on eating and weighed in at 209 while wearing clothes and shoes. My bathroom scale said 204 while I was naked, so I'll just go with that.

Anyways, I bought a 13mm Inzer Lever belt which cracked my rib because I cinched it too tight. That still hurts too but it doesn't hamper my lifts except for bench. On top of this, my brachialis had been hurting from low bar squatting, so until one week out I trained only high bar squats.

**The Meet**

[Video of 5/9 attempts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qg1NJYxRs0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Squat

* 165/363.8 - conservative opener

* 172.5/380.3 - slightly challenging. I had hit this for a single three days out.

* 185/407.9 - new PR

Squats felt good, but I'm just happy I made my attempts.

Bench:

* 110/242.5 - This went up easily enough.

* 117.5/259.0 - This went up slow (embarrassingly).

* 125/275.6 **fail**- Only failed attempt of the meet. I should have gone for 122.5 and just put a good number on the board.

Bench kinda sucked because it took forever. A lot of people did single-event for the bench, and he used the stage to do it. This ended up slowing down the meet a lot. This felt like a really conceited move on his part, even if he is the chair of the AAPF. But whatever, it gave me a good rest after squats.

Deadlift:

* 200/440.9 - Again

* 212.5/468.5 - Easy enough.

* 217.5/479.5 - Actually something of a struggle. Losing weight took its toll on my deadlift.

Deadlift was fun because I got to warm up with Kevin Fisher, Vladimir Tsatsouline. Vladimir ended up deadlifting 185kg, which was extremely impressive to watch (I didn't think to get it on video). While I was warming up, Pavel was offering his dad some chalk. I was standing about a foot away and he asked if I wanted some chalk, too. I told him sure, I'd love some. After I chalked up and handed him the block, he said (completely deadpan) ""Coffee? Tea?""

**Overall**

This was a tiny meet and I was the only one in my weight class. I walked away with a golden viking trophy (sweet) and a lot of encouragement from the other lifters--some first-timers, it made me long to compete in my true interest which is Olympic weightlifting. I will continue to train in powerlifting for a while, but it's not quite as exciting as Oly for me.

Cool stuff I saw that wasn't directly related to my lifts:

* Vladimir Tsatsouline

* Kevin Fisher

* Harj Basi [smashing all kinds of records](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/node/24003). She wore a crossfit shirt but I think that's forgivable.

* I met Pavel Tsatsouline. I thanked him for writing Power to the People. He seemed very humble and flattered.

* Saw Scot Mendelson make three attempts at (I believe) ~~1170~~1070lb bench. He failed all three

* I also play roller derby

**Meet Prep** 

I basically just took the few days before the meet off of lifting to make sure I was well rested.

I usually walk around at 125 lbs, turning shark week into shark month, complete with extra bloating. I got up to 130, and was down to 127 by Thursday night. I loaded water all week, and then cut carbs on Friday. Stopped drinking water late in the day and took a couple hot baths. Weighed in Saturday morning at 123.1, .3 under! 

Was very happy there was an IHOP next to the venue, sausage, pancakes, and french toast. I love breakfast

* 90 kg (198.4 lbs) - Easy opener
* 102.5 kg (226 lbs) - More of a grind
* 105 kg (231.5 lbs) - Doesn't move an inch

**Thoughts**

Though I didn't get the 500 total I wanted or make all my lifts, behind the camera), so that's a rare experience.

I did win my weight class... which no one else entered!

I'm doing another meet in a month... I should have a belt by then and will be able to weigh in the night before

**Meet Details**


Coming off the Battle on the Border

**Meet Prep** 


In terms of training


Usually each cycle has one heavy lift and one light lift.  For instance, I’ll bench a bit lighter close-gripped and incline.  The scheduling is also not set in stone, you can see I skipped a rest day to go 6 in a row so I could squat heavy on memorial day because I wouldn’t have to work.  As you can see, I live off of sets of 5 and fewer reps.  I like training for meets like this because I usually don’t cut much weight and putting up near max numbers in the gym often helps me feel comfortable with heavy weight.  I also don’t really like the idea of big peaking programs, rather I just taper off my accessory work and take most of the week before the meet off.


As for dieting, I found that as I refined my diet it tended to quite low carb.  A sample day on the last week before the meet would look like this:


Breakfast:

2 Eggs - ~140 Cal
2 Strips turkey bacon- ~ 60 Cal

¾ to 1 cup of egg whites - ~120 to 150 Cal depending on the brand I buy that week

I like to microwave my bacon to get it crunchy very quickly and then I mix that with my eggs and make a sort of bacon frittata in a pan over the stove. It’s quick


Lunch:

1 lb. of 93/7 ground turkey meatballs in a light spaghetti sauce - ~650 Cal


Dinner:

½ - ¾ lb. ground turkey or equivalent weight of grilled chicken breast - ~300-450 Cal

A lot (1-2 cups) of broccoli

I would usually snack on almonds or mostly egg white scrambled eggs.  A weird goal I developed with this diet was to be at or below 1200 calories by the time I got home from work

I drank 2-3 gallons of water the first two days of the week before the meet and slowly cut that to where I barely drank anything from noon the day before the meet to weigh in and made weight just fine at 146.8

**The Lifts**

My biggest priority for this meet was matching the record breaking numbers from my last meet

*Squat*

*170/374

*180/396

*~~185/407~~

*Bench*

*122.5/269.5 

*~~130/286~~

*130/286

*Deadlift*

*195/429

*202.5/446

*207.5/457

[Lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13wtelqQv7U&amp;feature=youtu.be)
Third squat is M.I.A.


Squats always feel heavier at meets and this meet was no exception.  I sank my opener which felt much heavier than I thought it should so I went for a more conservative second attempt.  Once I hit that I was satisfied so I went with 407 which was more than I thought I could actually do.  I sank my third attempt super low and looking back I feel like if I cut it a bit higher I would’ve gotten the lift. But I didn’t

I’m most comfortable at meets on the bench

Deadlifts this time were a guessing game because I only did them twice leading up to the meet and both times were either doubles or singles.  At this meet I forgot that I had pulled 475 in the gym and only remembered pulling 455 for a very heavy double on May 18 (not on the calendar pictured).  For this reason my attempts were more conservative than they should’ve been and had I known I could pull 475 in the gym

I ended up totaling 1140

**Future Plans**

I was informed after this meet that my &gt;400 Wilks would qualify me for the 2014 Arnold if I could replicate my performance at raw nationals on July 19 of this year.  I was totally unaware of this and had I known I would've just trained straight through to that meet instead.  I do plan on going to raw nationals and putting up a &gt;400 Wilks because the 2014 Arnold isn't until March which gives me plenty of time to get even leaner and stronger.  I plan on following about the same diet I did leading up to this meet

I plan on roughly following my 3 day cycles but I also need to start deadlifting off the floor again.  I stopped because I was getting terrible pain in my hips but knowing what I do now about stretching and recovery I can deal with it better if it comes back.  I also want to work in more incline/decline work

This was my first powerlifting meet. I began lifting in October of 2011. I had done some lifting in the past but never anything consistent and I was still pretty weak when I started. Ran SS for about 6-8 months. Made awful progress on 5/3/1 for 4-5 cycles and then switched to Madcow. Saw some really good gains on Madcow but lifting for intensity twice a week for bench and squat started to catch up with me. My numbers were still going up but I didn’t feel right. I felt banged up and none of the PRs felt good. So after 24 weeks of Madcow I started a modified version of the GZCL method. After 2 months on it, vitamin D, magnesium, fish oil, melatonin, and St. John’s Wort.  I know St. John’s Wort isn’t a “lifting” supplement but a happy lifter is a focused and consistent lifter.

**Meet Prep**

As this was my first meet I didn’t concern myself with cutting. I opted out of the 24 hour weigh-in and instead went for the 2 hour weigh-in. I’m definitely fat enough that I could compete in the 198s but I ultimately decided that I wanted to get as strong as possible for my first meet and then decide on whether I want to drop to 198. As for my training leading up to the meet, 275 bench, and 405 squat. The last week before the meet I deloaded everything and did some light assistance work.

**The Lifts**

Went 7/9. The videos are below. 

**Squat**

[155kg/342lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9BZyOni2vw) Make: Super easy. As stated

[170kg/375lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw26D56Iv5c) Make: Also pretty easy. Led me to up my last attempt by 2.5kg.

[185 kg/408lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsLCBNjP1uY) Make: Had to grind it about halfway through. I think this was the perfect weight for my 3rd. 

**Bench**

[105kg/230lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXSdoeBSkk) Make: Super easy. I’ve never benched with commands before so I wanted the first lift to be light enough that I could really focus on getting the cues right.

[115kg/255lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQTAcXOmpk) Make: This lift was confusing. It should have been fairly easy but I got stuck for a second about halfway up. A little doubt crept in to my mind and caused me to change my third attempt to 265 lbs instead of 275.

[120kg/265lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBUlxNZMzvs) Miss: Figured out that I was missing leg drive on the 2nd attempt and smoked the 3rd. Like a total newbie I missed the rack command.  I’m about 50/50 as to whether I was good for 275 as planned. 

**Deadlift**

[172.5kg/380lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2d8QfJm5Bg) Make: Super easy. As stated

[192.5kg/424lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceV-BcI9RDk) Make: This also felt pretty easy. Based on this I increased by 3rd attempt to 450 instead of 440.

[205kg/450lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-VveiGRHPY) Miss: Oops. Looks like I overestimated. The bar got up to my knees and my brain said NOPE really fucking loud. I was a little confused as I have never failed at that point in the lift before. Usually it’s off the floor or at lockout. I have never trained any variations of Deadlift and I think that I may need to start doing rack pulls and deficit deads to work on some weak points.

**Results**

My total was 492.50kg/1086lbs. Wilks was 300.5. There was nobody else in the Open 220 lb division so [I won first place.](http://imgur.com/b3QmxzD) I felt really embarrassed receiving an award for my weak ass total until I saw there was [a motherfucking Viking on it.](http://imgur.com/3donFgo)

**Final thoughts**

I’m really glad I took the step and did my first meet. One thing I will have to change is my warm ups. The anxiety of not getting to finish warming up and not having an available rack/bench/platform to warm up on freaked me out and caused me to start warming too early on all the lifts. For Deadlift I must have sat almost 30 minutes after my last warm-up until my first attempt. 
I thought I was going to break 1100 and I’m a disappointed that it didn't happen but I still feel good about my goal of getting a 1200 lb total without knee wraps by the end of the year. I was a little surprised that out of 80 lifters NOT A SINGLE ONE was in the 220 open division. I have no experience with other feds but my first impression on NASA is that they have way too many divisions. Every other lift was a “state record” and a lot of them were not terribly impressive. I’m looking forward to competing in the USAPL. After I finish about 3-4 cycles of the GZCL method I will make a post with results.

1341780882.0,w8hq2,"[Meet Report] Beast of the East of Tennessee Strongman Competition - 7/7/2012, Dunlap, TN. ",Nucalibre,57,19, finished third out of three

I completed my first strongman competition yesterday. I've been training with purpose for about 2 years now

**Training History**
Three months or so on SS.
Dicked around for a while a la Texas Method.
Been running 5/3/1 and variations for a little over a year.

Haven't tested maxes in a while, ~515 deadlift, ~210 overhead press. My bench is dildoes, which is part of why I enjoy strongman.

Leading up to the competition I emphasized overhead pressing

**The Competition**
I weighed in at 199 lbs, but it turned out okay. Temperatures were in the mid to upper 90s for the competition, which was its own challenge.

* Truck Pull - First up was the truck pull, get better shoes, extremely short choppy steps. Can't really complain though, one of the heavyweights managed to pull their 26000 lb dump truck about 30 feet with a broken foot.

* Viking Press - I'm most disappointed with how I did in this event. The lightweight was set at 250 lbs, I had near zero leg drive, and I barely managed to get 2 reps again when it counted. Need to get better conditioned and be stronger.

* Hercules Hold - I just completely botched this one. If we dropped it in the first 5 seconds we got a reset. I started to lose it to the left early on

* Medley - 240 lb Farmer's Walk for 50 feet, so the walk actually was pretty easy compared to everything else. Unfortunately the log press was not. I'd never used a log before, and had only gotten to play around with one a little before the competition. I was able to clean it to my chest twice, but didn't manage to press it once. Didn't get to the sled drag at all.

* Atlas Stones - I was nervous about the stones, and gave me a lot of advice on how to do the stones. They also let me borrow tacky since I didn't have any of my own. That stuff is effective, but nasty. For the lightweights the stone run was 200, 230, 265, 300, 330 lbs. I got the first three stones in a little over 24 seconds. I got the 300 lbs stone to my knees twice, I know I could get a 300 lb stone. Overall

In the end, I technically placed and qualified for nationals. I think I'll try a few more local competitions first though. I'm not sure when I'll be able to compete again as I have to start writing my dissertation soon, but I can't wait. It was awesome.

In terms of the gym, but it seemed like there were a lot of racks and other machines to work with.  There must have been a hundred different types of bars you could use.

The coaches that spoke were:

**Jeremy Frey:**

* Dropoff in power for static stretching before working out is minimal
* Working with someone that can't do a single push-up?  Use dumbbell work.

**John Meadows:**

* mTor is what turns on protein synthesis
* Do not do post-lifting cardio if you are trying to build muscle

**Steve Pulcinella:**

* Really didn't have anything very substantial
* [Triangle of domination](http://davefarinelli.com/TriangleOfDomination.png) was awesome.

**Chad Smith:**

* As you get stronger
* In-season for sports:  Don't use a lot of exercise variation

**CJ Murphy:**

* Strongman training is great functional strength
* Generally cannot compete well in both strongman and powerlifting at same time:  Pick one.

**Josh Bryant:**

* Single best assistance move for raw squats:  Pause squats
* Dips have a great transfer to overhead press

As it was about 95 degrees outside in London, especially during the training sessions.

In terms of any kind of swag, and free Spike energy drinks, protein bars, protein powder, and more.

In the two days, it was bench, strongman, and rehab, and on Saturday, it was squat and deadlift.

For my coaching, bench, and deadlift).  I didn't have too many cues or changes that I needed to make for my lifts in particular (some people needed to have everything torn apart and start over).

**Bench**

Dave had us work up to a PR on benches (we didn't work up to PRs on anything else

**Strongman**

We had Steve Pulcinella work with us on the Axle Clean and Press

**Squat**

Dave had everyone start with box squats (or basically exaggerated cues of free squat).  Being my first time, for those who haven't done box squats before, is that you will really feel like you are sitting back, as to where you would fall back if the box were not there.  Dave mentioned that my free squat form was just fine, so no changes to need to make there.

**Deadlift**

The only real tips that we got as a group were to check whether we would like sumo or conventional deadlift.  We would try each one

At the end

As to whether I would recommend it, and you were just confirming you were doing things right).  I ended up paying about $500 for the entire trip when you consider travel and lodging.

* My nerves got the best of me on all my missed lifts (except 1st bench) and I think if I was more focused and stayed tight I could have easily made a ~5-10kg higher total.

* At my last meet at the end of March I total 1160 at 197. I left the meet disappointed in my lifts and just not really happy with the numbers I hit. I needed to change that. I decided to run the whole 12 week smolov squat program. All the things they say about smolov are true. My hips and knees really took a beating

* For 8 weeks I ran a program that I made up and it worked fairly well. About a month out from the meet I decided to drop my bench program and run a hybrid smolov jr for my bench

* I have always been a strong puller so negating the deadlift for 13 weeks didn't really worry me. (I actually pulled twice during the switching phase

I was somewhat disheartened by some of the struggles I had today in my performance. Though I have been training really hard and I got plenty of sleep in the past week, my best friend and a buddy of ours took 2nd and 3rd. I am taking today as sheer learning experience.

Results-
Squat:
 
Opener: 330 lbs- three good lift signals

2nd attempt: 355 lbs- scratched the lift
forward and rendered me from standing all the way up

Final attempt: 355 lbs- three good lift signals

Bench:

Opener: 235 lbs- Went up like it was nothing

2nd Attempt: 265(max)- Failed attempt

Final Attempt: 265- started off good

Deadlift:

Opener: 315 lbs- 3 Good lift signals. Felt light.

2nd Attempt: 340 lbs- Got it up fine

Final Attempt: 340 lbs- Good lift

Overall:
Totaled at a 930, then back hitting the weights on wednesday.

My weightlifting history:
This is now my 5th year competing in competitive lifting. I started when I was a freshman in high school, slept a lot, I thrived on being in the weightroom. I won first place in all regular meets. I ended up shooting my maxes to a 215 lbs bench and a 170 lbs C&amp;J. I was 2nd in the district but won the regional championship, I made it to states. I placed 15th that year. My senior year was even better, saw gains every week. Won every meet, won districts, placed 2nd in regionals that year
     This fall I met my best friend who is also my partner in crime in the weightroom. We constantly worked out and got stronger. He made gains faster than I did and it sent a strong sense of inspiration in me. He and I thrived off of achieving new goals and helping each other out. We eventually got sick of our school's gym and sought out the perfect gym for us. Just as he posted, he is in his 70s and still reps 315 on bench like it's paper. Joey Scalzo is my idol. He is also a man of shorter stature and he is built like a tank. He is everything I wish I could be. squats over 500, benches around 495, he even deadlifts over 400. Like I said, he is a tank. We started training there late January and were on an intense training cycle. My friend who has also posted his report has all of that information. I have never felt this strong in my entire life, my friend could say the same. 
    
The impact the weightroom has had on my life:
 For me, I have stunted growth. I was under 40 pounds until 4th grade. I had to take Human Growth Hormones(HGH) as a kid(around 9 years old) to help myself grow. It has helped a lot. I grew a good 6-8 inches in height. I am now a totally different person than I was years ago. My life is consumed by weightlifting and I think I would marry a barbell if I could. This meet was an eye opener for me today. These past few years have been. I have realized that it does not take someone to be tall and huge to be strong. It takes the will and the dedication. Without the weightlifting, I would have never known I could ever possibly do any of the things I do. It has forever changed the way I see myself. 

 I know this whole section is not about my meet but I thought it was necessary to put a bit of myself into this seeing that this is my first post. I do need help and suggestions on ways to improve my deadlift,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,t3_1a2apc

Meet Prep

I signed up for this meet in January so I had just over 3 months to try to peak.  I transitioned from madcow to a smolov jr for bench and squat.  I threw in some deadlifts on the weekends and focused on singles.

Making Weight

I am normally around 135lbs

Nerves

I put in a separate section because I did have some nerves/butterflies as it was my first meet.  I knew I am actually stronger when people are watching

I was one of a handful of solo lifters without any real team affiliation.  A ton of people from FSU were there.  I sat around in my UF hoodie :) Go Gators!.  A lot of people had coaches and teammates so I felt a bit out of place.

Competition

I was worried that no one would even compete in my weight class because I want to compete against the best.  Then the start list came out and I saw that the state record holder from the 123lb category had moved up in weight and had been putting up good numbers.  I went from being nervous about winning without competition to being worried about not getting 1st place.  Turns out my competitor was a very nice guy and like me

Squat

122.5kgs - 269.5lbs - Felt a bit heavy

130kgs – 286lbs (PR) - This one felt good.  I was more worried about my next lift as I failed on 300lbs during training several times.  This was a PR by 1 pound.

137.5kgs - 302.5lbs (PR) – I didn't go as deep as usual

Bench

95kgs - 209.2lbs – This was very easy.  I wanted to open with 205lbs

102.5kgs - 225.7lbs – I knew I could get this as I had done it with a pause during training.  Unfortunately

107.5kgs - 236.7lbs (PR) – I failed to get this up in training so this was a good get.  I am gonna post a video

Deadlift 

165kgs - 363.7lbs - Went light and it came up very easy.

175kgs - 385.7lbs - 10kg jump because I knew I could get this

185kgs - 407.7lbs (PR) – I knew I had to make a big jump if I wanted to get respectable numbers in comparison to my main competitor so I went big.  My competitor hit his second attempt of 175kgs and went for a state collegiate record of 182.5kgs.  He got 2 reds and a white on his 3rd lift so I knew I had to hit my lift.  It was not a huge struggle

Overall

This meet was awesome.  I went 9/9, his wilkes was 371.691 and my wilkes was 373.627. YES!

My GF couldn't be there due to work

For the future

I am going to look into continuing smolov jr or going with the base smolov for squats.  I can see my squat getting better by at least 25 pounds or so.  Adding 15 pounds to my deadlift would be great as that is my favorite lift.  The remaining weight would have to come from bench.  Smolov Jr really helped my bench so I may continue the same program.

Pictures and videos to come.

The videos aren't the best quality...some are out of focus.  I'm just glad I have any video at all.

1341928554.0,wbsit,[ Meet Write Up ] USAPL Central FL Open - 1443 @ 212lbs,ErickStevens,61,10,31,"Normally I'm too shy to post one of these but for once I'm actually happy with how I performed. A little background: After spending close to 10 years training like a bodybuilder I took an interest in powerlifting late last year. I competed in my first meet in October of 2011 and totalled 1225 @ 198 with a 415 squat

We got a room in the same hotel that the meet was at the night before so I wouldn't have to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to drive two hours to weigh in. My entire training cycle I had hovered right around 215lbs (Thanks to the BioRhythm Diet!) but I still wanted to be careful so I was very conservative with my dinner that night. I ended up eating a big old sandwich from Larry's Giant Subs and a brownie that my fiancee had made. I really wanted to watch the UFC PPV that night but it turned out there was nowhere in the hotel that was showing it and we weren't able to watch it in our room. With nothing to hold my attention on TV I ended up falling asleep around 11PM and got 8 solid hours

The meet started on time at 9AM and began moving very quickly. There was an even mix of raw and equipped lifters although there was only a handful of females competing. The squat was the lift I had the least confidence in going into this meet based on the last couple weeks so I was very conservative with my opener of 485lbs. Warm-ups felt light so I wasn't too worried but I still didn't want to be ""That Guy"" and bomb out like an idiot. 485 felt like 485 but I didn't want to get too crazy, my fiancee came over and asked what I was planning on going for next. I told her and with a disgusted look she said ""That's it?!"". I knew the record for the class was something like 526 and my squat PR was 530, so I kind of shrugged my shoulders and said ""540?"". She nodded and that was that. It wouldn't be the last time she inspired me to go for a big number. I knew 540 was good as soon as I unracked it. New USAPL 220 FL State record and a 10lb PR for me!

Bench was next. I hate benching. I had (finally) hit a 300 paused bench in the gym so that's what I was shooting for coming into the meet. The competition bench felt alien and I couldn't really get comfortable so I kind of knew a big PR wasn't coming. I played it safe and went 275

After a 20 minute intermission it was time for my main event - The deadlift. I decided to open with 575, my improved form made 600 fly up even easier than 575. I'd missed 600 on my third attempt at my last two meets, so this was a huge moment for me. I walked back to the scorer's table and contemplated skipping my third attempt as my lower back was obliterated by this point. After a brief discussion with my fiancee, it should come as no surprise that I put in 611 for my third attempt. It was a battle but I ended up grinding it out giving me an 31lb meet PR and an 11lb all time PR. 

After going 9/9 for the first time in my competitive PL career, and bench shirts into account. Regardless, knowing I was the best raw lifter was enough for me and it gave me a good note to go out on for the year. 

What I Learned:

- Don't be your own worst enemy. No matter how weak or beat up you feel in the week(s) prior
- Rest more. This was the first time I took the entire week before a meet off and it made a big difference. This is going to be a standard practice for me from now on.
- Longer training cycles. I'm going to take my time prepping for my meets next year and spend 8-10 weeks instead of my usual 6. This way I won't put so much pressure on myself to progress so quickly and end up running myself into the ground like I did this prep cycle.
- I need to get my bench up. Some how
- No DL bars during meet prep. Next time I prepare for a USAPL meet I'll be doing all of my pulling with a stiff bar.

Started ""lifting"" around 2008ish

More recently I was really inconsistent with training from Summer '12 until this spring and all my lifts just kind of stagnated... thankfully squat and dead didn't fall really.

**Squat**

5/3/1 pretty exclusively. I've found if I follow the progression and actually am consistent I make steady progress here.

**Bench**

I've done a few bouts of SmJr for bench, inconsistency played a role in my bench stagnating/dropping after 350. Again... staying consistent with 5/3/1 I get ""slow but steady"" increases in strength.

**Deadlift**

Basically stalled since late 2011

## Meet Prep

The purpose of this meet initially was just to get comfortable on the platform and play around with water weight to see what I could do. 

**Lifting**

I didn’t really do any prep lifting wise other than some depth check of a few heavy singles on squats and started pausing some heavy doubles/triples on bench and then did one session the week leading up where I just hit some light weights to grease the groove. Still followed my basic progression I had been on the last few months.

**Water Weight**

Sorry… this is long first time I’ve actually cut weight for a meet.

This was… interesting. Weigh ins were 24hrs,000mg sodium, at the beginning of the week tapered carbs a bit and cut all food/water/etc. off at noon on Thursday. Thursday morning I was 207. Thursday night I started doing hot baths for 20 minutes on 20 off, thank god for a laptop. I did about 6 sessions in the tub, at around 105-110 degF. After the 6th session I felt like shit my body temp was way too high and I felt light headed and wanted to pass out… and to make matters worse that session I only dropped .5lbs I went to bed at just over 202lbs around 11PM. Woke up randomly at 430 or 5AM and decided to weigh myself, was only down another .5lbs or 201.8. Took a less aggressive approach this time just under 105 degF water 15 minutes max aimed for 10-12 minutes and assessed how I was feeling after two sessions I was right at 200… laid down and took a nap. 7AM woke up and drew another bath again 100-105ish and did 10-15 on 20 off I felt like a champ, no overheating and still consistently dropping .5-1lb a session on average… 4 sessions later I was [89.5kg on my scale]( http://i.imgur.com/jLuvStq.jpg)... Yes I was so excited I took a picture. At the weigh ins (45 minute drive away) I stepped on the scale and it settled at… 90.1kg… “Guess you’re losing your boxers and socks”… 90.0kg

After a few liters of pedialyte

Special thanks to /u/Master_Cylinder for egging me on and keeping my moral up (and probably making sure I didn’t die) throughout this process and /u/NoMediocrity for letting me steal his water loading protocol.

## The Lifts

[Meet Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXbvtjMtATc)

**Squat**

192.5KG/423lbs – Three Whites – Easy

202.5KG/445lbs – Three Whites – Not the easiest squat I’ve had but still solid decided only a 5kg jump

207.5KG/457lbs – Three Whites – Easy as the first actually turned around to see if I got reds on depth since I assumed I didn’t go deep enough since it was so easy… should have done 7.5 or 10KG 

**Bench** 

*insert comment about shitty hand-offs here*

145KG/319lbs – Three Whites – Stupid Easy jumped the rack command a bit

155KG/341lbs – Two Whites – Probably should have been all reds (downward motion)

160KG/352lbs – Two Whites – Same stall position but bar kept moving upwards… though a bit unevenly

**Deadlift**

245KG/540lbs – Three Whites – Easy this solidified my place for the 198s (no one on my platform attempted this weight)

260KG/573lbs – Three Whites – Pretty solid

272.5KG/600lbs – All reds – got it to the knee looked down and said “fuck this isn’t going anywhere” 

Again

## Results

* 1st place 198lb class (1383lb/627.5KG)

* AAPF Raw State Records for Bench/Deadlift/Total (tied another guy for the squat but he was a kilo lighter so he gets the record)

* AAPF Best Overall Male lifter

* [Got a fuckin’ sword]( http://i.imgur.com/TxCmJPp.jpg)

## Final Thoughts

Coming away from the meet I was crazy high that I had “won the meet” when I hadn’t really planned on doing anything spectacular. I had a ton of support from other redditors and the other lifters there in general. The other strong guy in the 198s was super supportive and we went back and for about attempts since we were so close in strength and it made it really fun

Water weight wise… I think what I did Friday morning is the way to go

So I've been lifting for about a year and a half now and hadn't had chance to compete yet. Decided that I needed to get my first meet down to see how I'd do. I've been bulking pretty hard all fall and didn't bother cutting for this

* Height: 5'6""

* Weight: 206lbs

**Squat**

I had a hard time deciding what to attempt on this.  My ultimate goal was to get over 400lbs, though I tipped forward a bit and almost lost it at the bottom. Decided to go for 402. It actually ended up going really well, I think I left a little bit on the platform. Overall good.

**Benchpress**

Was really expecting this lift to suck. The best I'd ever done paused in the gym was 255, probably could've got a bit more on bench as well.

**Deadlift**

Finally I had deadlift. As with the other two lifts, so I took 501. Again my grip failed before I could lock it out. If my grip had held, I am sure I would've got it. Pretty disappointed that I was so close and failed, but still got 30lbs more than my gym PR with 485.

**Overall**

I really enjoyed the meet. NASA ran it really well, going to try to get closer to 1250 before I cut down. My ultimate goal is to cut down to the 165 weight class. But anyway, really good experience overall.

What to look for:

* Bar racked slightly higher than nipple-high
* Solid deracking with no wobble or excessive walkout
* Squatting it out of the rack
* Tight upper back
* Chest up
* Sitting back
* Feet should appear bolted to the floor between reps
* Bar path should be over the center of the body
* Deliberate breathing rhythm
* Knees track feet and don't buckle inwards
* Proper depth without relaxing to get there
* Locking it out at the top while standing up straight

Things that don't really matter and are personal preference:

* Visual focal point
* Stance width
* Elbows up or down (as long as back is tight)
* Hand placement on the bar (as long as back is tight)
* Placement of the bar on the back (as long as it's not on the neck)
* Knees traveling past toes.  Excessive travel is bad

Current stats: Male, 26yrs

**Background**

Lifting seriously since Aug of 2012. Before this I was cardio bro, chest/tri, legs, shoulders.

One day I Realized I wanted to get strong while remaining small. While looking for a powerlifting routine I discovered GZCL method. What does GZCL even mean? I didn't care. The dude was as strong as an OX. I'll try it. See [here](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13n0j5/the_gzcl_method_for_powerlifting) for details on the routine.

**1st Cycle**

Did the program a laid out exactly. Programed my maxes way too high. I remember this the most because I developed tendonitis.. I think. Every damned joint in my body was sore... especially knees and elbows. I was legit scared I had arthritis. Squat/Bench 2x a week was tough. Took 2 weeks of deload and went for PR's. Joints still hurt but not as much.

Weight: 148lbs (on slow cut)

Squat: 245 &gt; 275

Bench: 220 &gt; 225

Deadlift: 305 &gt; 325

Press: 115 &gt; 135

Total: 825lbs

What really helped was adding Ghetto GHR's (no machine at LA fitness) and Bulgarian split squats to tier 2/3 for squats.

**2nd Cycle**

Squat routine stays the same. Added AMAP for deadlifts at the end of tier 1.
I was upset my bench didn't go up. Kept bench max the same. Added Ed Coan's bench routine to teir 2 work. Focused on Lat + tricep work for tier 2/3. Joints a little better but still sore. Took 1 for deload/PR.

Weight: 152 (still on cut

Squat: 275 &gt; 295

Bench: 225 &gt; 225x3

Deadlift: 325 &gt; 355

Press: 135 &gt; 145

Total: 885lbs

**3rd Cycle**

In progress... Currently in 2nd week.

Squat/Bench routine remains the same with slight tier 2 variations depending on mood.
Still feel like my deadlift is really weak. I'm focusing on increasing deadlifts by alternating heavy rack pulls, and speed deads for tier 2 work. Joints randomly hurt but not as much as before.

**Lesson/Tips**

* don't program your lifts too heavy (especially if you are new to this volume/weight)
* heavy 2nd tier work really helped (3x10,2x10)
* listen to your body and change things around. if something didn't work

Before delving into the negatives


**Training**


Having ran three Smolov base cycles between October and April, and I realized it was probably time to start doing something about that despite hatting bench.  My approach from then until now is what some people might consider unconventional.  


With the exception of a couple banded speed squat sessions with the typical Westside template (I'd eventually drop these all together), speed was excellent, and strength was going up at incredible rate.  I attribute that to just focusing on only doing one rep at a time, not thinking about how you'll grind out the subsequent reps.  Even on 95% singles, my PL team members commented the bar speed was considerably faster than it had been on the first few reps of the 4x9 days of Smolov.  Interestingly enough, all of the days I felt like maxing out again on squats, and deadlifts for that matter had been days I'd done at least 20 singles.  Without any rhyme or reason


In regards to bench, I figured ""What the hell?  Let's try this for bench too.""  In reality, I didn't do all that much flat benching besides some banded speed benching.  The bulk of my pressing was strict OHP and paused benching on a low incline bench to ease up on the shoulders a little bit.  I started pressing almost every day, switching between OHP and inlcine, just like I would with squats.  The rep, sets, and intensities were pretty much the same: no less than 85% of 1RM, and between 5-15 sets depending on how I felt that day.  Above all though
To balance out all the pressing I tried to do some sort of pulling every day: rows of any variation, face pulls, OH squats, external rotation stuff, etc and work on shoulder mobility.  


During this time, I pulled a solid 520 and pulled 550 to my knees before it stalled.  


**Diet


After my last meet, most likely from water retention due to salt and carbs.  Eating ice cream, brownies, and doughnuts three times a day may sound like fun, but in reality it was miserable, always lethargic and bloated.  With the closure of the dining halls, I cleaned up my diet considerably and went back to Paleo.  Being an under-employed student paying rent in a college town, $6.25/five dozen, and potatoes were the bulk of my diet.  An average day was usually two pounds of chicken and a couple of potatoes after lifting and then half a dozen eggs, cooked up in a frying pan before bed.  There were some assorted vegetables in there and a cup of heavy cream or half &amp; half for extra fat with each meal.  It was basically carb backloading coupled with IF and it served me well.  


The strength gains came along nicely in the gym and I stayed around a lean 160.  This was slightly heavier than I was last time a week out from weigh ins


Post weigh in dinner was the usual BBQ feast: lots of ribs, I can put away a fair share of meat, my best effort was probably a three-and-a-quarter pound beef roast over the course of an hour or so.  For whatever reason though, I left the restaurant feeling absolutely miserable.  Walking to the car was terrible and I thought for sure I was going to lose all of my precious gains.  Thankfully I made it back to my parents house but when I tried drinking a glass of water, it immediately came back up along with some meat.  Not taking the hint, I tried to drink water again because I was still dehydrated and throwing up probably did not help with that matter.  This time even more came up after I got that feeling you get when you know you've drank too much and now you're fucked because you know you're going to throw up everywhere.  After that I called it quits, rolled up a towel to use as a pillow and slept in the bathroom until about midnight.  I woke up not covered in vomit, thought about trying to drink water again


Upon waking, it was still a 15 lb weight gain.  notbad.jpg",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,vpm1,

I've received many e-mails over the past few months asking about customization and other nice features, and will also let you use other programs (e.g. Starting Strength, SL5X5, Madcow etc), among some other nice features I have lined up.

My vision for StrongJournal is for it to be a no nonsense site where you can get the proper stats about your strength progress and keep improving

Please let me know your thoughts - if it's shit or if it's gold

Here's the important stuff: 

**Squat**- I didn't have my camera slave present to film this

1. 150 kg / 330 lbs [2 reds
1. 160 kg / 352 lbs [3 whites]

1. 187.5 kg / 412 lbs [3 whites]
1. 205 kg / 451 lbs [3 whites]

**Meet Prep**

I didn't do much in terms of making weight. I'm working my way up to the top end of the 82.5 kg / 181 lb weight class, and I don't think it had much, if any negative impact on my total. 

**Recent Training** 

Since my last meet and more so in the last 2 months, and it's pretty maintainable. I'll keep it up until a change becomes necessary. 

**Post-meet Thoughts**

Omg that shit was so cash. Especially that deadlift. If I play my cards right, but fuck me I'll actually be pretty proud of it if/when I get there. Next meet may be in July, so we'll see what happens there. For now, I'll be content training often and slowly moving my way up the bodyweight ladder until I can hit a not-fat 181 pounds.

Had to cut down from 77 kg for this (not an amount worth bitching about, and hopefully that extra size will give me a greater capacity for strength gains.

and here are my attempts in text form:

**Squat**

1. (not filmed) - 150 kg - 2 whites

1. 170 kg - 3 reds - just didn't have it in me

**Bench**

1. 105 kg - 3 whites
1. 110 kg - 3 whites
1. 115 kg - 3 whites - I should have gone for a bit more on my second and third attempts. It all went up pretty easy

**Deadlift**
 
1. 185 kg - 3 whites - Gave this everything I had. So dizzy after all was said and done. I knew I wouldn't be hitting my next 2 attempts
1. (not filmed) - 187.5 kg - 3 reds - barely got it off the floor
1. (not filmed) - 187.5 kg - 3 reds - same deal

**Thoughts**

Great first meet experience. Probably won't compete in another until I reach the 82.5 kg weight class and have numbers that are somewhat competitive. Don't have much else to add. Honestly, I was there for a full 10 hours... so I didn't stick around to see how I placed. Hopefully the results are up in the next few days and I can see how I fared against all the other 75 kg dudes. 

edit - 

**Training History**

Training history has a long and short version. Long is that I trained consistently for 2 years after high school

I started back again last September, so I think that had something to do with it. I started with a little program I built myself with the knowledge I'd retained from when I trained before. Actually made some progress, then switched to 5/3/1 for a time, made a little progress, then moved on to another program I made based on some westside stuff. Sound ridiculous yet? It kind of is. I would've likely been better off sticking with starting strength when I first started... oh well. 

The last few months I've been following a program I made myself. I like it. A lot. Plan on sticking with it for quite awhile

* Day 1 - Squat (work up to a heavy single at ~90% 1RM
* Day 2 - Bench (work up to a heavy single at ~90% 1RM
* Repeat until Friday or Saturday using the same percentages. Rest for 1-2 days
* Always squatting 3x per week. Benching 2-3x per week depending on if I train Saturday or not.
* Percentages are changed weekly in one of two ways (75,90) or (75,85,80,90). 
* The 3-5 sets of 1-4 that follow the AMRAP sets change according to the AMRAP percentage used. On 75% days
* Accessory work isn't listed up there, and some kind of curl if I'm feeling up to it. On bench days I add in some kind of overhead pressing and some tricep isolation work. I aim for 1-3 sets of 8-16 reps on most accessory exercises. Rowing movements are usually done for 1-2 big sets of 16-30. Shrugging movements for 3-5 sets of 3-5.

1343866248.0,xjac1,"5/3/1 XLSheet V2.0- Stall Feature, AutoSync Progress Chart, 3/5/1 for PL, Rep Goal",diregna,9

Hi Everyone

I created a 5/3/1/ Spreadsheet about 2 weeks ago with a ""Rep Goal"" feature that most people thought was pretty neat. However

P.s. Download link on bottom for those who wants to skip the scary block of text.

**3/5/1 For Powerlifters Templates**

- Templates for those who wants to do the 3/5/1 Variations
- Inclusion of Singles

**Progress Tracker**

- The Progress Tracker is 100% synced with your latest workout numbers. Just enter the number of reps done and the estimated 1RM will be automatically graphed and logged.
- It requires absolutely no work on your part to maintain. Even if you miss a week
- Furthermore
- The only thing that you need to do is enter the number of reps done in the main worksheet!

**Stall Feature**

- What really sets this 5/3/1 Worksheet apart from the every other weekly workout sheet is the Stall Adjustment. As much as we all want never ending progress, erasing your past progress, and what if you have to reset more than once? 

- This is what the Stall Adjustment is for. Not only will you be able to choose which exercise to reset

- To use this feature

**Rep Goals**

- Full Explanation in Spreadsheet. 
- For 3/5/1 Powerlifting

- ""As the weights get higher
This is when you should modify the rep goal feature in the Start-Options page.""	

Disclaimer: The rep goal is for you to play around with and is by no means trying to detract from the idea of 5/3/1. If you don't like it

**Other Features**

- Increment Per Cycle:
From cycle to cycle
You do have the option of changing this to your own preference by editing the cycle increment.

- Estimators:
The 1RM Calculator gives you a rough 1RM based on the amount of weight done for x number of reps
The Rep Goal Calculator tells you how many reps you need to do with a certain amount of weight to achive a certain 1RM
The Weight Calculator tells you the how much weight you need to do for a certain number of reps to achieve a certain 1RM
The Estimators are based on Matt Brzycki's (36*weight)/(37-reps done)

- **Supports KG

- **Ability to change exercise order (new in V2.1!)**

- Contains 1 YEAR (52 week) of training log

* Olympic Weightlifting for about 9 months

**Lifts**

Clean + Jerk

* [2] ~~95kg~~ - bad lift
* [3] ~~95kg~~ - bad lift

**The Meet**

This was my first ever meet

I'd wanted to make a 195kg total (I've made 85+97.5 in practice before, next time I need to stay more focussed and give myself more time on the platform and not rush into the lift.

My coach was unable to make the meet for family reasons, there's probably something in there I need to remember to help me in future situations.

**Meet Prep**

I didn't really have to think much, I made 75.95kg this morning, without really having to try too hard.

As for training, so I think coach wanted to get us working harder and be more focussed to get our game faces on ready for the meet.

**Future notes for myself**

* Making weight isn't hard
* Take even more powerade and red bull
* Take even more food
* Rush less, I'm convinced that's why I wasn't committed enough on my second and third lifts and as a result missed.
* Competing is hellu fun
* probably more to note as I go over my videos later on

**Meet Prep**

The night before the meet, instead of getting up early and driving Saturday morning.  This is a fantastic idea, and I highly recommend it.

I didn't have to worry too much about cutting to get to 198

**Lifts**

**[Video Recap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqvvfbQ475Q&amp;feature=youtu.be)** - Took video using a tripod on my own

Went 9 for 9 with all whites for all lifts.

* **Squat**
* 335 lb.
* 375 lb.  (Feet were in too close on this one
* 405 lb.

* **Bench**
* 215 lb.
* 255 lb.  (Tweaked my back on this one
* 275 lb.

* **Deadlift**
* 365 lb.
* 405 lb.
* 425 lb.

**Outcome**

I ended up with a **total of 1105 lb.** and placed 2nd in the 198 Open Raw class.

**Thoughts**

* I definitely recommend getting a hotel or a room and staying there the night before if the venue is more than an hour away.  It's a great way to make sure you don't run into any hassle on meet day
* I was probably the only lifter in the meet that was completely on his own and without a team (Grand Rapids Barbell and the Kzoo HZ varsity team was there).  It definitely helps to have that support from a team
* Beef jerky is a great meet food.
* Having a good meet is a great way to go out and celebrate St. Patty's day!",,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/r2x0r/meet_report_usapl_mi_hs_state_championships/

1368532944.0,1eb55k,"[Meet Report] Hokkaido Powerlifting Championship - Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan (515kg @ 101.8kg | Wilks - 311.266 - Open class",Lodekim,60,29, 210kg deadlift.  [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMiqv3M5V4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Background:**

The basics: I'm 27, and I weighed in at 101.8kg, thus competing in the 105kg class.  I was fat with some (not much) strength from not being totally inactive until 2010, lost weight living abroad (250lbs down to 190) started working out on weight machines in June of 2011, touched a barbell for the first time at the end of October 2011.  Started on Stronglifts and dicked around a bit after that, getting to a 325lb squat, 235lb bench, and since I wasn't able to be
consistent enough for most programs I've played around with a few different philosophies and programmed for myself.  Not as effective as a program, and 175kg deadlift.  I slipped on my second deadlift attempt and probably called it a bit too high, so it should have been at least a little higher.

After that meet I went on a bulk and wasn't careful enough, that's why I competed in the 105 class as a fatty.  My diet was generally lots of meat, as many vegetables as I could get into my food, and then I ate junk, carbs, fried chicken, and stuff like that on the fatty bulk.  As CNP said, and I did.  What a shitty bulk.

Training: I tried a few things in the past 6 months.  The 2 main forms were building up to a few training near maxes, but progression was kind of stupid.  It helped me figure out what I could do, but probably didn't build much. CNP style singles and triples were useful some places, not so much others.  I tried to build my deadlift by not deadlifting because I was pissed off at my inconsistency at the last meet, bringing it back with a few different methods about 2 months out, and it actually worked okay.  My gym PR before the November meet was 190, and I didn't even pull 190 a single time before 2 weeks out from this last meet.  I'll detail what I think worked and what I'm trying going forward at the end for a ""going forward"" section.



**Meet Prep:**

I cut weight for my first meet, but to get a higher Wilks I didn't do much for breakfast the day of.

I planned to hit my openers and second attempts on Tuesday, I completely forgot how to squat that day, loaded the bar too high on my back, and dive bombed it, so I hit my opener twice, the first was high, the second was a grinder, and it worked pretty well.  Thanks Kelly Starret for having good hip mobility drills that I could use.

On Thursday I went in to do some light practice, 100kg on the bench, and 140kg on the dead.  All easy.

Thursday night my throat started getting sore, but I think it was allergies more than being sick. My sleep wasn't as good as I would have liked, but it was apparently good enough.


**The lifts:**

There were 2 flights of full meet lifters and 2 more flights of bench only, with pretty shitty racks, but I did fine.  Built up to a single squat at 150kg about 10 minutes before my flight started. Bench I built up to a 110 single, and DL a 180 single.


Squat:
1st attempt - 160kg - 3 whites, and it was my first attempt.  People say open with something you can triple, and I have never tried doing a triple at 160kg.  I do however do 15 singles with 155kg in like 25 minutes.  I debated going lower, but I wanted to feel comfortable with my second attempt and not have to make a huge jump.  When 150kg was easy in warm ups I knew I could hit this, and wow, it was easy.

2nd attempt - 170kg - 3 whites, but I had an attempt left to try it.

3rd attempt - 175kg - 3 whites, not so easy.  I got pumped up as much as I could before this lift, dropped down, came back up, and had to scream through the sticking point.  I might have had 177.5 in me but maybe not, and 180 I don't think would have gone up. I'm very happy with this.


Bench:
Bench is probably my most consistent lift

1st attempt - 115kg - 3 whites

2nd attempt - 125kg - 3 whites, no problem.

3rd attempt - 130kg - 2 whites, 15kg meet PR, interesting lift.  I had failed 127.5kg in the gym with my gym owner calling the commands, so I wasn't 100% sure I could do this, but 125 was pretty easy.  I wish the video had the whole lift, but my girlfriend's camera ran out of memory in the middle.  Interesting because I realized my lockout is apparently really strong.  Fast off the chest, but there was a grind through the sticking point.  Once I got through that though the bar just shot through to lockout.  I remember being surprised how fast I finished the lift.  Really happy with this one.


Deadlift:
When I deadlift after squatting heavy it's always pretty bad

1st attempt - 190kg - 3 whites

2nd attempt - 200kg - 3 whites, so I played it conservative and went for 200.  It went up easy and I had my 500 total.

3rd attempt - 210kg - 3 whites, or 212.5 or whatever because there was another guy in the 105's with the same total as me, making the same sized jump as me, with a lower body weight.  If he pulled 200kg and I got 210 he would have won based on being lighter.  I was lucky and he didn't get it, I did, and this won me the 105 class (though the 74 and 82kg class winners both out totalled me I think, and I tied the 93kg class winner).

Total: 515kg.


**Meet results:**
So like I said
getting that silver.  I dunno.

I'm happy with 2 all time PRs and everything being a meet PR.  I think there's another competition in July that I probably won't bother with


**Going forward:**

So first, and then allow myself to cheat a bit on the weekends.  I want to get to 93 but I also don't want to never get to do anything fun with friends.  I'm not strong enough for that sacrifice to be worth it.

On training

For squatting, and the hard part is catching my breath more than moving the weight.  I'm going to keep to lower rep sets with heavy weight, and I'm going to get my high rep hypertrophy mostly from accessories.  I'll try to improve my high rep squatting, but I'm not going to fixate on it.

For bench

For the deadlift, it doesn't seem to make sense for me to go really heavy.  I just get gassed and form falls apart.  I really like pulling a lot of singles for the dead, so I'm gonna try that once a week or every other week or something at lower percentages than I do singles on the squat or bench.

**Overall**



Took first in my weight class, got to work on that sticking point, form definitely needs some work as well.   Not bad for a first meet.  

I've been lifting for about seven months now, at 5'10 and 138lbs, did mostly just bench and curls, the usual screw around stuff beginners do,but really got hooked around seven months ago.  


**Some Background**

I started seriously lifting in university, a former wrestler and high school weightlifter. He started to train me, and I improved quickly, soon able to match his best lifts. Granted, hes only 5'2 and barely 140 soaking wet, but it was an accomplishment to hit a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat
	In January, 24hour Fitness and were totally turned off by some aspects of those gyms. The limited equipment, the ever-present ""No Deadlift"" rule, and the infamous 'Lunk Alarm' that I'm sure many of you are familiar with.... Anyways, we found a home.  


LionHeart Gym. Its a small gym, with low lighting, chalk covered concrete and carpeted floors, and an old-man ball sweat odor permeating the place. Its AMAZING. There are tons of iron plates, a squat rack, power cage, and 2 competition benches. Its usually empty of people, he often contributes to the noise on bench day.  

 On our first day, (whom I shadow), and world record benchers Joey Scalzo (who my friend shadows) and Leon Barry, who are all training for the Europa Expo in Orlando in 6 weeks. They  welcomed us into their workout with open arms, and we have been training with them ever since. They have been a great influence and their expertise and support has been great in preparation for this meet. I have the utmost gratitude for those guys, for helping us train and for driving with us to the competition, where they helped with equipment and technique and inspiration. They really are the best. 

**Training**  
This meet wasn't really planned for. Our first day at LionHeart


Monday-Squat and speed deadlift  
Wednesday- Speed Bench and Upper Back  
Friday- Deadlift  
Sunday- Bench  


6 weeks out - Triples to max

**Diet**  
Ate pretty healthy, occasional 50 nugget bucket from Wendy's, triweekly trips to Chipotle and all you can eat wings at Winghouse every monday. Okay, perhaps not so healthy, but I tried to stay protein heavy but always ate my fruits and veggies. 

**Supplements**  
None. Multi and fish oil.   

**Future Training**
Bulking up to 220. Going to run Joey Scalzo's bench press routine ( a modified Russian routine shortened to 8 weeks) or do Smolov for squat. Not sure yet. Deadlifts should improve with squats.
My goal is to break the Florida state record as found [here](http://apa-wpa.com/APA%20Florida%20Mens%20Records.htm) by January 19th next year. Squat will have to improve from 355lbs(161kg) to 425lbs (193kg). Bench will have to go from &gt;225lbs(102kg) to 275lbs(125kg). Deadlift will have to go from 455lbs(206kg) to 550lbs(250kg). I know damn well that Im going to shatter it. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

My form, rather with not activating the correct muscles. 

I was neglecting to focus on my Glutes in my Dead lift and Squat. I was not focusing on my weaker muscles and other muscles were over compensating

This imbalance, but they carried over to everyday life, and thus ensued years of bad conditioning and imbalance. 

I'm not a sport scientist, there are simple triggering exercises out there which can help bring into consciousness inactive muscle sets. After a while of activating these dormant muscles while working my weights up, new pathways have developed and now function better within my lifts. 

For me it was my glutes that mainly needed attention. But just because your lift looks okay from that outside

**Current Working Weights**

Deadlift: 470lbs

Bench: 300lbs

**Introduction**

Many of you may know me from my work as the Forum Admin over on Fitocracy. Little background on me as a lifter (more can be found [here](http://blog.fitocracy.com/post/15625232537/fitocracy-member-spotlight-lokkju )). Started lifting in January of last year


Quick run through will talk about each program a bit more in depth later in the post. Training started with four months of madcow, and ran for four cycles. Started Sheiko #29 in November,  #37 in December, and will finish my first cycle of #30 this week.

**Methodology**
Sheiko’s training methodology is similar to that of other eastern European trainers. Rather than max effort lifts weekly, an athlete will repeat the big three several times a week, and often twice in a lifting session. This helps to improve form, and drive growth. Weights (depending on the program) range from 60-95% of the training max on a given lift. The key premise is that the low weight and high volume will allow for better recovery.

The training is complex

**Templates**

There is a basic template to most of Sheiko’s 3 day programs:

Monday

- Bench/Squat

Wednesday

- Bench/Deadlift

Friday

- Bench/Squat

Week One

- medium

Week Two

- medium

Week Three

- high

Week Four

- medium

Mondays are always the heaviest squat day

Wednesdays are the only deadlift days

Fridays tend to be the volume squats

Keep in mind when reading these that the Russians write their numbers reps x sets rather than sets x reps like we do.

http://www.elitefts.com/documents/Sheiko37.htm

http://www.elitefts.com/sheiko/Sheikotrcomp.htm - CMS/MS (Elite lifters)

and the peaking cycle

http://www.elitefts.com/sheiko/Sheiko32.htm

**Personal Experience**

**29**

This was my introduction to what Sheiko is all about, and has the least volume of any of Sheiko's routines. There are 964 lifts (big three does not include accessory) in the program as written. Which can be quite the rude awakening for some that might not be used to the volume. However you'll benefit from working with lighter weights (85% is the peak for squats and bench, 90% on the last Wednesday for rack pulls).

For me this was a rough cycle. After three weeks off

Second week got better

**37**

Let me preface the discussion on this mesocycle by saying, with only a slight increase in volume (intensity is about the same).

I actually ran this on a cut

**30**

Imagine the most beat up you've ever felt after a mesocycle... that's what 30 was for me. I felt like I sold my soul to make it through this mesocycle... ever done 15+ sets of squats and 15+ sets of bench in the same day? You will on day one

The intensity and volume combination is brutal. Every day your working above 80% of your 1rm on each of the big three. While doing in the ball park of 10-15 sets of each lift. The assistance work also increases. Eat like a horse

All that said before I moved onto 31 I was able to up my working weights to 300/375/450

**31**

I'm currently in the second week of 31. While the intensity is rougher, but the peak weights stay relatively the same. 

**Conclusions** 

This style of training works for me. The volume, and don't have the set up to do deficit deadlifts and rack pulls, this program works nicely with Coan's deadlifting routine. I've seen some pretty solid jumps in PR's with the combination of the two programs. However others might struggle with the total volume.

I modify the programs by super-setting the flies with chin-ups, and rowing. Mainly because the program takes a huge toll on your shoulders. 

Overall the routines are interesting. They are just taxing enough that you feel exhausted for a day and a half, advanced, or elite level I would definitely recommend the routines.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pdjec/sheiko_multicycle_review/

I use mantras to help me lift. Buddha's a fat jolly bastard by all reports

There are two kinds of training mantras

**Cueing Mantras**

Here's the cue mantra I was using today while snatching.

""Chest up, weight on the heels"".

I'd repeat it to myself walking to the bar, I would act them out.

You can do it in your head or out loud. Out loud works better

I used to fiddle with long mantras to cover all the bases -- ""Chest up, tighten abs, deep breath"" and so on, but the problem is that by the end of the mantra you've forgotten how it began.

Plus, having to keep the weight on my heels. Hence the short mantra I've been using lately.

**Confidence Mantras**

These are better known

A confidence mantra aims to still the fear that can cause you to abort or fail a lift. I have had mixed experiences with these. I tried a mantra for cleans and snatches: ""I am strong, so I dropped it.

On the other hand

I'd be interested to see if anyone else has come up with some mantras of their own.",,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/nl41j/on_the_use_of_mantras_in_training/

Bodyweight of ~175 lb.

Program based of a conservative 1RM of 295 lb.

Earlier in January I began a Smolov Jr. cycle for weighted chins based on the success that I had on it with my plateaued bench press (230 -&gt; 245). My weighted chin had been fairly stagnant for a few months when I began.

Weeks one and two were followed almost exactly with the exception of an added rest day on week one. I encountered a couple of hiccups on week three which caused me to draw it out to two weeks. The first was that I had a powerlifting meet right in the middle. The second was that a few days after the meet

The sets/reps/weight were followed exactly

I attempted to eat a small surplus during this program. I gained about 2-4 lb of scale weight although it is hard to tell how much of that is water.

Comments: Running this program on weighted chins was certainly a success. I haven't gained this much strength in such a short period of time on my chins ever

The program was relatively easy. Even on the last day, weighted chins have a different curve of strength compared to most other lifts such as the bench press. By this I mean that the percentage of my 5RM is closer to my 1RM on my chins compared to my other lifts.

This was my first single ply meet and I blew it, an account of how the meet went.

Thursday morning I weighed 274.5. Friday morning I weighed in officially at 266.4 lbs. Within 2-3 hours

[**Squat**](http://youtu.be/aS99bS27XH4)

My squat suit, which completely disrupted my warmup. I took 505 for a ride a couple times just to get the suit on all the way. It hurt a lot more than normal. 

First attempt: 606

Second attempt: 650 A little better. I hit depth

Third attempt: 650 Botched my setup

Thus I bombed out of my first single ply meet. It took my brother, and a power rack to get me out of my suit.

All was not lost

**Bench**

I didn't do anything here except help byukid warm up and lift off for him. If my squat suit was too tight to use

[**Deadlift**](http://youtu.be/vNAVgq5vFfw)

These were done raw, even with help.

First attempt: 606 I've tripled this weight before and pulled it while sick and dehydrated

Second attempt: 633 This would be an 8 lbs all time PR and a 27 lbs meet PR. Came up easier than the first. 3 whites.

Third attempt: 650 I didn't expect to actually get this, most technically perfect pull I've ever done. 25 lbs all time PR and 45 lbs meet PR. 3 whites.

**Lessons Learned**

* Bloating works for raw stuff

* If you're going to lift equipped

* I'd even go as far as to say avoid Titan gear for your first suit and shirt. Get a nice easy Inzer suit, though.

* Being friends with meet directors and federation officials can't hurt.

* byukid's wife is real. She rules her sister-wives with an iron fist of congeniality.

* If you're going to train for an equipped meet, never balancing or finishing anything, and that contributed to constant pain and frustration. Have a good crew with experienced lifters to help you learn the gear. Only a couple of the guys I train with squat equipped, the rest being bench specialists, so I didn't learn the ropes there as well as I could have.

I don't know that there's a whole lot more to say. I need to clean up my diet and get my training organized. Now that I know I'll be starting PT school this summer

**Lessons**

1) I need to work on endurance. By the end of the bench

2) I need to learn where parallel is. My first two squats were super deep. 

3) I should have attempted more for my 3rd squat. I would have had an easy PR at 203.7 lbs. 

4) I need to get a different singlet. The edges rubbed my legs to shit.

5) Use baby powder on your thighs before deads. Otherwise

**Meet Prep**  
So, but I was also practicing the pause. Squat didn't go up, but it was now with wraps instead of sleeves and taking a lot more effort to focus on getting below parallel. My workout nutrition was a custom trueprotein mix and good old dextrose. Other than that, I focused a lot on very simple and effective accessory work- pendlay rows, zerchers, lots of ab work.

**The Drive**  
Friday my wife and I got up, and cheez-its in the car for all purpose snacking. I had a couple of those tubes of protein for ease of use. Lunch was a few McD's burgers and lots of fries with extra salt. Also a protein shake. Dinner was more burgers and fries with a big salad. I think I salted the salad for good measure. The weather on the way there was generally good, but there was a stretch of about 75 miles in Nebraska where snow was sticking and I tapped the brakes just wrong- we spun sideways and into the median. Thankfully there was no one around us. We were a bit shook up, but after we got our heads together and back on the road, we proceeded slowly without incident. Got to the hotel, did lots of mobility stuff and downed a few tylenol pm.

**Meet Day**  
Got up early and downed a finibar and a ton of gatorade and another protein energy shot. Made our way to the meet. I got checked in and all my gear checked out, but this was the first meet they had run there, so given that it wasn't too bad. Lifting started an hour later than expected. I had a big protein shake (about 250 g protein) a couple finibars, a couple chicken sandwiches, a gatorade and a half, and some other food to keep me going.

**Squats**  
They were calling squats high left and right

[Squat 1](http://youtu.be/tc84gahXTU0)- 235 kilos
[Squat 2](http://youtu.be/JFzo-9IewDU)- 250 kilos
[Squat 3](http://youtu.be/kbbaGLALqGQ)- 270 kilos

Overall, 255 then 275. Ah well, it's only 10 lbs short of my PR. Also, on the second attempt the judge gave me the rack command with the squat signal- you can see my confusion. Third video my wife accidentally cut short.
  
**Bench**  
Bench warmups went okay. The pauses were way long and I would say about 3/4ths of the lifters missed at least one attempt at bench. Several people bombed out because of bench. It was tough to watch.

[Bench 1](http://youtu.be/Sfacw3YPmLI)- 145 kilos
[Bench 2](http://youtu.be/0834KHmhMxk)- 160 kilos
[Bench 3](http://youtu.be/E8WxWdOGgUM)- 170 kilos
  
Kinda pissed about this- I was sure I'd have 170. Also

**Deadlifts**   
Deadlifts were pretty straightforward. I kept my warmup short and simple. I upped my opener because I knew I could get it. I didn't feel like I had blown my energy on squats

[Deadlift 1](http://youtu.be/XIexDC89WQw)- 250 kilos
[Deadlift 2](http://youtu.be/CisFCJNf2gI)- 280 kilos
[Deadlift 3](http://youtu.be/4ehtnjXZj4s)- 290 kilos

I tore open my hand on deadlift 2 (11 lb pr) and spent a lot of time looking for a bandaid. Then when I got to the platform and set up, I got loose and went nowhere. Ah well. I know I could have had it if I hadn't let myself get distracted.  

**Post-Meet Analysis**  
So there were some computer issues and they couldn't sort out who did what in what divisions. I'll find that out later I guess. Just checking their results posted online there are a few anomalies, laid around, then went to Buffalo Wild Wings, downed a couple dozen wings and a few sides, then dozed off.

All in all, but the meet was eye opening and really motivating. I want to do so much more now. 

Thanks to everyone in [/r/weightroom](/r/weightroom) who gave feedback on my formcheck, who sat through the whole meet and the car rides there and back. She hardly complained and did a great job videotaping, making sure I had enough to eat and drink, and being just dang wonderful.",,False,,True,t3_p316t

I see the majority of you discussing training protocols that are so complicated it's a wonder who wrote them. Don't be fooled by these fancy terms and ""scientific"" findings. Most of you are at early stages of strength training and delving into programs like this get you pre-occupied with things that don't matter. Your concerns shouldn't be with hitting a certain % for a certain set/rep scheme on a certain cycle to hit something else. Keep it simple, and press weight over head.

I’ve been training with Jacob Cloud (from 70sbig and Vintage Strong) since roughly last October.  I did a local meet last November and totalled 555 weighing 82.5 kilos, and a deadlift way below what I was capable of (thanks to my terrible attempt selection).  After that meet, I started training for Texas Strongest Man in March, and it wasn’t until spring that I really started to focus on powerlifting.  I’m built to deadlift more than squat, and rather than work on my weak points, I just kind of ignored squats and deadlifted a lot.  Jacob made me cut back on the pulling a bit, clean up my squat form, I was looking at roughly a 500 squat


**Meet Prep**

My last training day was the Monday before the meet.  Middleweight guys were scheduled to lift Saturday afternoon, and weighed in at 82.3 at noon on Saturday.  I drank a liter of grape Pedialyte and then went back up to our hotel room and started eating.  EVERYTHING.  I had four eggs, a huge bowl of protein pancakes, a banana, peanut butter, and a giant-sized coffee from the airport Starbucks, plus another two liters of water.  It was good.  Lots of salt on everything.  I rehydrated to the point where I was almost uncomfortable — Jacob told me to try to stay right at that edge of being overfull all day long.  I did a pretty good job of that, the edge of uncomfortable ends up being pretty damn unpleasant after eight hours.  

Which is how long it took between weigh-ins and my third deadlift attempt.  There were so many competitors in the 83 and 93 kilo classes that weigh-ins alone forced the meet directors to push the start time back from 2 to 2:30.  I was in the third flight, and it helped.  


**Squat** - *200/220/230

I worked up to an easy single at 185 kilos and buried my opener at 200, which would be a lifetime raw PR for me.  I don’t really remember much about the lift itself, but I got three whites and after that I was rolling.


**Bench** - *135/140/145

There was a pretty long break between squat and bench.  I had another banana with peanut butter, and I hadn’t been able to stay injury-free for more than a month or so leading up to the meet, so there wasn’t a whole lot of warming up to be done anyway.  I took my last rep backstage at 125 kilos, and then hit an easy 135 for my first attempt.  My second attempt at 140 was a bit less aggressive and a bit slower.  Jacob took me aside afterward and told me that I needed to pick it up for the last attempt at 145.  I put on my headphones, zoned out for a good eight or so minutes, and ended up making 145.  It felt like the easiest lift of the day for me and by this time the adrenaline was driving everything.


**Deadlift** - *265/280/285

By the time my flight was called for deadlifts, so I took it again and felt a bit better.  I opened at 265 and it felt a little heavier than it normally would — probably because it’d been a long day.  280 on my second wasn’t bad, but it felt heavy, and it felt like forever before I got the down command.  I started to worry about my third attempt.  Originally, I had had thoughts of taking 300 kilos if everything was going well (which it had), but I didn’t have 300 in me that day.  Jacob called for 285 — just enough to put me into fourth, but too much that I would have to get in my head about it.  He sent me to the back of the room and told me to put my headphones in and hoodie on.  I got up for 285, and really thought I pulled it OK


**Final Thoughts**

Even missing my last deadlift, but I was so out of it by the end that I thought he was serious and that I had missed out on hardware.  It was a nice surprise at the awards ceremony!  In case you couldn’t tell, none of that would have happened without Jacob.  He talked me into doing the meet in the first place, and was the best coach/handler I could imagine.  All in all, I ended up with a lifetime squat PR, meet PRs on all three lifts and my total, and a 439 Wilks, by far the best meet I’ve ever had

**Meet Prep**

I actually signed up for this meet on the deadline date

**Making Weight**

On Monday I was 208.8lbs and I wanted to compete in the 198 class (the meet was on Saturday). I knew I was carrying a lot of water weight and I used the water loading protocol to cut.

* **Monday** – Drank 3 gallons of water and did not worry about the foods I ate. This made me bloat like crazy.
* **Tuesday** – Drank 3 gallons of water again except I did not eat carbs
* **Wednesday** – Drank 2.5 gallons of water and followed the same diet
* **Thursday** – Drank 1 gallon of water and followed the same diet. The difference was that I shut off water intake and food intake at 5pm.
* **Friday** – Weigh ins were at 11am and I ended up weighing in at 197lbs. I was not dehydrated at all.

I had done a water cut for my first meet but I was very dehydrated the whole time

After I weighed in the feast started. I ate everything and anything I saw. I went to bed around 208 that night. 

**Squat**

345lbs – I forgot to tighten my belt so basically I squated without it. It felt fine though

375lbs – I went way too deep on this one. I'm still not sure why I dipped so low

385lbs (PR) – I made sure I didn't go too deep and the lift was much easier

**Bench**

245lbs – I opened very light and I smoked it

275lbs – It felt good and I was excited to try for a new PR. (my current gym PR bench is 285)

290lbs (No lift) – I don't wanna talk about it

**Deadlift **

455lbs - Felt easy and it was quick. I didn't expect anything else

500lbs - It went up pretty fast

525lbs (No lift) – I was drained by this point and that is the story I am sticking to

**Overall**

This meet went pretty well and I ended up going 7/9. I didn't hit the exact numbers I would like to have

**For the future**

I am going to take it easy this week

Sorry

Leading up) Slept terribly the night before, and I don't normally sleep very well before a meet anyway.  I felt decent going in anyway.

Squat:
Warmups all felt really loose

235 - 3 whites - I knew something was wrong now

250 - 3 whites - Horrible lift

255 - 3 whites - WAY easier than the second

I gave up hope of winning the meet here because Nick Tylutki squatted 305kg

Takeaway: I need to work on my setup so that I can firstly figure out the exact stance that I want

Bench Press - I had strained my pec 1 week before this so I wasn't expecting a fantastic day benching

160kg -  In my normal setup I was unable to get my feet perfectly flat

170kg - On the way down things started to feel iffy and when I reached the bottom my pec was re-injured and I almost told the spotters to take it.  Instead I decided to try

After my this I was in 4th place

Takeaway: I need to get my chest and shoulder healthy.

Deadlift:
Warmups went decently
277.5kg - 1st attempt deadlift is always a light warmup
307.5kg - Really fast
332.5kg - Both of the other people with a chance to finish second missed their deadlifts so I had locked up second place.  This led me to go for a relatively stupid attempt, which is where I always miss.

Final: Totaled 732.5kg which is not even close to PR territory

Overall impressions:  Need to get my squat consistent

* I can pick a counter weight (55lbs) that lets me do 3sets of 5 from all the way down to sternum to the bar.

* I can incrementally deload by 2.5lbs or 5lbs.

* Resting my knees on the pad prevents me from cheating by bringing my knees forward in the top half of the pull up. Also I don't get cramps in my hamstrings from keeping them as tight as possible.

* Reps feel much more consistent in terms of speed

Thoughts: This is a 15kg total PR

In the beginning of August I got sick until the 15th. That day I also went to Kashmir in India to visit my relatives. There was no decent gym there, I had recieved a sweet parting gift from India in the form of Gastritis, and just as I recovered from that I got a severe cold. Then I got to train for one week, which was until this monday, before I was informed of the upcoming meet. So this total is truly what I can perform when I'm at the lowest of the low, therefore, the end result is something I can't be disappointed at.


That's all for me

**Impressions:** Everything went up except my weight. That's great! I even noticed a decent increase in size. Bonus! But why did my squat not improve much? The answer is that I hurt my knee during the first week of the 3rd cycle and had to take 3 weeks off from squatting. In the meantime I continued to bench

This program is not for the feint of heart. I ate at maintenance for most the program but I would recommend you eat at a surplus. I'm pretty sure I left some gains on the table by not eating as much but at 220 I'm already a fat fuck. Carbing hard the night before seemed to give me the best results.

There is no such thing as a light day for any of the main lifts. I thought I was going to be able to include power cleans and power snatches in the program but I just could never find a way to fit them in without feeling wrecked. I definitely learned that I don't do enough pre-hab. I think that the knee injury plus two smaller injuries to my wrist and back are attributable to this and if I am going to continue using it I will need to keep up with foam rolling and dynamic stretching. I'm still on the fence about whether this program is too much volume for me. I have had success in the past doing lower volume programs like Madcow and TM. However, and tears in the process. 

I'm going to start cycle 4 on Monday. This time I will be doing more pre-hab and eating more calories. Hopefully this will help alleviate some of the challenges I had.

Kelly has also partnered up with Rogue to make more (expensive) toys , like the [Gemini](http://www.roguefitness.com/mobilitywod-gemini.php) and the [Super Nova](http://www.roguefitness.com/mobilitywod-super-nova.php). These toys look awesome but I'm not sure if they are worth the money considering how cheap and effective lacrosse balls are.

The reasoning is that access to the smaller plates causes paralysis of analysis (should I do 257x5 or 280x5?). So about 6 weeks ago I dropped my current programing of 3 sets of 5 adding 5 lbs a week and started macroloading my lifts. I am 5'10"" 178lbs and lean bulking (gained about 2 lbs in the 6 weeks); while I realize my lifts are still pretty intermediate I found this progression much more enjoyable than monotonously doing my 3x5 each week. I felt that the higher rep work did wonder for my work capacity as well.

* Squat went from a shaky 280x5 to a strong 315x5/275x10 (all done onto a 1"" below parallel box)

* Bench went from 225x1 to 225x4 (Bench and OHP had been stalled at the same weight for a couple months prior.)

* Deadlift went from 335x3 to 315x10/405x1

* OHP 145x1 to 165x1 (Although I used 10lbs weights for OHP progression)

An example squat day would look like this: warm up until I get to 315 and rep that out aiming to add 1 rep per week and then a couple singles or doubles

**Meet Prep**

My last meet was March 23rd, and it's been working well. Consistent increases in weight, and I don't feel like shit all the time. I very rarely go over 80% in training, which I feel is worth noting. It's been good to me thus far. The week of the meet, I dropped down from about 178 to 173... which was fucking pointless and definitely didn't do my bench or deadlift any favors. No more of that. I won't cut any weight unless I absolutely have to, Wilks be damned.

**Squat**

1. 347 lbs (3 whites)
* 374 lbs (3 whites)
* 396 lbs (3 whites)  

* Squat went really well for me

**Bench**

1. 231 lbs (3 whites)
* 253 lbs (3 reds - straight up failed)
* 253 lbs (3 whites - barely went up)
 
* My bench felt and looked like shit. I attribute it to cutting weight and generally being a little bitch. If I can't hit at least 275 at my next meet

**Deadlift**

1. 424 lbs (3 whites)
* 463 lbs (3 whites)
* 496 lbs (3 reds - 100% fail)

* Going into this meet, and it started late, so I'd been there a long time since weigh-ins. Less fatigued, I'd at least have gotten that shit off the floor. Next time, 500+. 

**Overall**

I did ok. Wound up with a couple PRs, so I'll have plenty of time to hammer my weaknesses. Hoping to break 1200 at my next meet. ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,

## Pre Meet
I’ve just finished my first cycle of Juggernaught coming into this meet though I was liberal with not taking deload weeks on a couple of waves (8s

Since it had been so long since I’ve tested

Have always had trouble being heavy enough, fairly dry, by far my heaviest and close to my goal weight.

##Squat
First attempt was cozy

If you’d asked me before the meet, but once your halfway up you know you can make.  It was a bit of a ‘squat-mourning’ but I’m guilty of worse.  20kg PR, and very happy.

## Bench
The first was very easy.  I overly cautious on Bench for openers since I’ve bombed a meet missing my opener before.  Flew up.

Since my numbers are no where near enough to win, and overly optimistic for my third.  On bench this meant a larger jump than normal (for me) but to 120kg, which I haven’t attempted before.  Since I doubled 115kg a couple of weeks before I really thought it would happen.  I was wrong. The third attempt was the same, maybe an inch more (I have giant arms).  Dissappointed.

##Deadlift

My plan was really to only do two lifts and go all out on my 2nd attempt.  This worked well for me at a team event last year where I was only deadlifting

My second attempt (250kg) went horribly wrong, I wasn’t quite in the right mind space yet and was a bit rushed getting up to the platform which was a bummer.  Bar came up unevenly, probably a result of a bad setup which was unsurprising. just cleared mid shin.

Third attempt (250kg) I got the mind set and timing right but just didn’t have it in the tank.  Got the bar to just below the knee.

## Post Meet
My next meet will be the New Zealand Nationals at the end of September.  I’ve still got a lot of way to go as an intermediate lifter, but it’s good my partner (she’s tiny) and for my own sanity with food.  I’m still getting a lot out of the sport.

I really want to pull a big deadlift this year (280kg?)

------------------------------------

As the title says

I hurt my lower back 4 weeks ago, I kept straining my pecs each time I benched for about 3 weeks straight. I knew I could get around 90% though.

I weighed in at 221.4 after dehydrating and losing 7 pounds. I couldn't get down another 0.9 lbs. It's fine though. 242s it is!

My warm ups for squat and bench felt pretty terrible. Everything felt heavy. Deadlift was...okay.

**Squat:** 405/455/500. This was completely unexpected. I haven't gotten anything over 475 in about 8 months. 500 was a piece of sweet

**Bench:** 345/365/Pass. This was completely expected. My pec hurt a lot

**Deadlift:** 405/495/555. This was an awesome way to end the meet. It was easy. Again, but switched to conventional. I like it a lot more now.

I'm 5' 7.5"" and 27 years old. I've been lifting for close to 5 years now, I went from 385x4 to 405x5 (not touch-n-go), and my bench press didn't actually go up at all during that time mainly because I had been fighting brachilialis tendinitis for a good 5 months and it made benching heavy nearly impossible.

Prior to this meet my unofficial total was 1125 with a 415lb squat


**Meet Prep**

When I had signed up for the meet back in September, but I knew I could easily get into the 181 weight class with a little work. So I decided to do a small cut and it only took me 3 weeks to get there. For the first couple weeks I just lowered my calorie intake and for the 3rd week I went full blown Ultimate Diet 2.0. While glycogen depleted I was down to 177 and fully carbed up I was sitting at 181-182. After the cut I just spent the remaining 3 weeks prior to the meet maintaining my weight.

Shout out to shortkid for the advice of how to taper for the last 3 weeks prior to my meet. 3 weeks out I worked up to my openers on all 3 lifts. 2 weeks out I worked up to what would be a new 1 or 2RM. 1 week out I worked up to my openers followed by no lifting the whole week except for a very light workout the Tuesday before just to keep myself loosened up.

The meet had a 2 hour weigh in and just to make sure I made weight for the 181 weight class I ate a little bit less the day before

**Meet Day**

I drove up to Cleveland the night before and stayed in a hotel, then I woke up at 1:30AM, and then a few minutes later I fell asleep until 5AM, and then pretty much laid there awake until my alarm went off at 6:15AM. All in all I maybe got 4 hours of sleep.

I got up, paid for my USAPL membership card, picked my opening attempts, and then proceeded to gear check.

My gear I brought with me:

 * House of Pain singlet
 * Inzer wrist wraps
 * Adidas powerlift shoes
 * New Balance minimus zero road shoes for deadlifts
 * Titan knee sleeves
 * Grey t-shirt
 * Some cheap briefs from wal-mart since they won't let you wear boxer briefs
 * Knee high compression socks

After gear check I then had to pick my adjustments for bench height and squat rack height and write them on my card. After all of that I finally made it to the weigh-in, some reeses peanut butter cups, some dried mango, and downed a bottle of water and a bottle of vitamin water. I still had a good half-hour before the mandatory rules meeting so I drove to a nearby starbucks and got a Caramel Macchiato with an extra shot of espresso (3 shots of espresso total). Then during the meet I ate some more pop-tarts, a banana, a bunch of water, a can of AMP

I started warming up for squats around 9AM and then the meet then started at 9:30AM. There were around 90 lifters there total and they had the equipped lifters mixed into the same groups as the raw lifters. I was in Flight 1 Group C.  One mistake I made was that I thought they were going to do the 1st attempts for Group A, they did all 3 attempts for Group A, then all 3 for B, and then C. So really I warmed up a little bit too early and had to sit there a bit, but overall I don't think it hurt me too bad.

**Squats**

Got 3 whites on all my squats and my attempts were:

* 1st: 375
* 2nd: 395
* 3rd: 420

I must admit it was a bit nerve racking seeing so many people in the previous groups bomb out or not hit depth on their squats. My first attempt was 375, paused for a bit (at this point I thought I did something wrong), and then said ""don't make it look so easy"". I laughed, turned around and saw 3 white lights, and was pretty pumped from that point on. Nailed my 2nd attempt at 395, and then got 420 for my 3rd attempt. The 420 was definitely my highlight of the day and the lift I wanted the most.

**Bench Press**

Went 2/3 on bench, or just remain a T-Rex 5ever. I also thought I strained my lower back really bad during the 250 attempt because it started hurting pretty bad right when the bar started going back down, you can see in the video where I get up and put my hand on my lower back. Maybe I was arching my back too much? Luckily it felt better by the time I got to deadlifts.

* 1st: 220
* 2nd: 235
* 3rd: 250 (Missed)


**Deadlift**

Went 3/3 on these and hit a 20lb PR! I switched to doing sumo instead of conventional and it just feels so much better for me

* 1st: 405
* 2nd: 445
* 3rd: 475

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rBPhH7lou8)


Overall this was a huge success. Very happy to have totaled over 1100 and hit a new squat and deadlift PR.

My plan now is to cut to 165 and then compete at the USAPL Raw Nationals in Orlando next July as long as there isn't a qualifying total for it!

Squat- 225 (good)

Bench- 115 (good)

Deadlift- 295 (good)

This was my first meet and I totaled 675. I've totaled 730 in training with all 3 lifts on the same day, this was one of the most fun experiences of my life and I can't wait to do it again.

**Making Weight** I had weighed myself at 131 lb. one week out, *Protein Essentials.* After I weighed in on Friday at 129 lb., I spent the entire day chugging Pedialyte and eating sweet potatoes and chicken. Come Saturday morning, I was fully rehydrated and had plenty of energy to lift. 

**Training** I've been doing Wendler's 5/3/1, and I can provide details if anyone is interested. 

**Summary** The meet ran VERY long, judges, and all other organizers were awesome, too... Although I think judge Bill Dorell's white light button must have been broken due to the number of red lights he gave =P

There were a ton of lifters in this meet... But not a lot of women. I was a bit disappointed by that, we had a large turnout of local lifters from both Iron Sport and Jersey Iron. Shawn Boylan, a lifter from Iron Sport, returned to the platform after a four-year hiatus due to a knee injury from squatting at a different meet, and he was definitely looking strong. The Yale Powerlifting Club also came out for the meet. There were some very big lifts, including some huge 4th attempt deadlifts. I actually had no idea you could get a 4th attempt after making all 3 of your required attempts, so THAT is something I'll be remembering for my next UPA meet. If I'd known that ahead of time, then gone for the PR if I got a 4th attempt. In general

Another neat thing about this meet: they told us that there has never been a UPA meet in Pennsylvania, when someone will inevitably break said record. Unless I can step up my game and beat them to it, of course =)

This was really a wonderful meet.  [All proceeds will go toward Belle's medical bills.](https://www.facebook.com/events/391550810940588/permalink/405774086184927/)  I had a lot of fun and really appreciate the effort the organizers went to in throwing this meet.

**History**  [TMI] [Girl Stuff]

This meet has been a long time coming for me.  At about this time last year

Anyway, until it finally progressed to the point where I couldn't even squat down to pet my cat without getting woozy on the way back up.  I stopped squatting and deadlifting entirely at this point, and did a bunch of research of how to raise blood pressure.  Lots of salt did not work.

Around January

I started lifting again on a modified SS where I did front squats every other time.  I was squat morninging quite badly,200 calories a day.  Usually closer to 800 than 1,200.  I'd stop eating when I got nauseated.

Realizing that this was my new normal, I started eating a lot more carbs than I had been.  After a few weeks of this, my strength started to go up again.  I signed up for the meet I'm writing about here.  I switched the normal SS program to lifting 4 times a week with a squat+leg day, a bench+arm day, a front squat/deadlift day, and an ohp+shoulder day.  My shoulders are very weak, so I was doing something for my shoulders every day except deadlift day.

**Meet Preparation**

I just continued doing what I was doing

This was my first 24 hour weigh-in.  It was fun, the only woman in my class.  I celebrated with a York patty, then went to an Italian dinner and had a giant piece of lasagna, which I could only eat half of.  A little later, I had a milkshake.  Thus, I destroyed any help my Synthroid might have done me, because I took it about a half hour later

One thing to note is that I did screw up my Metformin timing.  I should have had it with dinner

**Aftermath**

I got some really good feedback from one of the other lifters.  I'm apparently straightening my knees on deadlift well before I should be, allowing for self correction.  D'oh!

I'm mostly pleased with how I did.  I didn't do as well as last year, my eating, and my strength.  I'll look for another meet sometime in the fall.

This was my first meet.  I started lifting about 9 months ago (I lifted in high school but that ended 10 years ago)

The meet overall went well.  There were about 15 lifters, just taking a deload week before the meet.  The thing I was least prepared for was warming up.  I've never tried to max out in the gym, so I wasn't sure what I should do for warmups, or what I could get on a third attempt.

I was fairly confident in my squat attempts and I probably could've done 10+ more.  Bench had been giving me the most trouble in the gym, but since I've never spent a day testing my max, it was all based on 5/3/1 work sets and the occasional single of my training max.

1357813708.0,16b3pl,A quick overview of the mental game,rez9,50,8,4,"This will be a quick and dirty post about mental skills since I keep seeing these rambling videos about trash. I will try to keep examples relevant to us pick-up-and-put-down-ers

#Forging the Iron Mind

##Foundation

Before anything you need to have a few *understandings* working for you:

1. **Control**: I am the cause of all outcomes in my life and I determine its course. Everything good in your life you made happen
2. **Confidence**:  I have the ability to affect the outcomes in my life. Through education
3. **Commitment**: I finish what I start. I will be consistent until the end; doing whatever is necessary. Commitment implies both consistency and giving it 100% effort.
4. **Challenge**: I require challenge to grow; when I fail

Another foundational skill set is what I like to call the mental *gamestate*:

* **Focus**:Focus your attention *on the objective* like a laser or a spotlight. Intense focus.
* **Indifference to distraction**: If focus is like a spotlight
* **Arousal control**: Some objectives require energy and strength

From here on I'll refer to whatever it is you are doing as the *game*.

##Pregame

###Goals
Take this time to set goals for yourself. Short and long-term, by the end of the year you've got an excel spreadsheet with bodyfat percentages and nutrient macros.  Google: S.M.A.R.T. goals

An example goal for me would be to deadlift 4 plates within a year. (*Nuttin' but a peanut*).

###Plan
If a goal is *what* you want to achieve, stall, or setback.  You also can't see every short recovery, exceptional gainz, or any other assorted win. You will need to tweak the plan sometimes.  Sometimes you will need to scrap the plan because it sucks and something better showed up.  Or you learned more about what you need to be doing. No one just dips a paint brush into 10 cans of paints and creates a masterpiece in a single stroke. It takes time and effort and attention... but also a plan!

###Visualization
Now that you have a plan you need to get in some visualization.  This shit works if you do it right. See yourself doing perfect reps, the bar touching your chest. See yourself from the third person. Get creative. Always visualize the best possible outcome.

###Identity
Some people think these are cheesy but... who are you? Who the f&amp;mdash; do you think you are? Keep it short and positive. *As a man thinketh in his heart

A formula could be ""what i do; what that means"": 

* *I put in hard work at the gym; I can move mountains of iron.*  
* *I stretch and contract on every rep; my body is a masterpiece.*

Before you hit the gym remind yourself of who you are.

##GAMETIME *aka paintime*
Now is the time to put on your warface and put your mind into gamestate.

###Internal dialogue
What goes on in your head can either help or hurt, bounce, HIP DRAHVE*"" for the squat. What should be going on in your head is a distillation of the most important things about your game.  What do you need to do to either be perfect, or get closer to it. If your movement has a few parts to it make sure to have cues for each, like in bench pressing have a cue for setting up and a cue for reps. Make sure to keep it positive and specific. Examples such as ""Don't miss, don't miss"" or ""Gotta score"", revise them to be specifically *what do I need to do to not miss || score*.

Here's why you should not have negatives in your cues: *DON'T IMAGINE A PURPLE PUMPKIN DON'T IMAGINE A PURPLE PUMKPIN*.

###Solution focus
There's no such things as problems. That's just your shitty interpretation of reality. Always ask yourself how you can make things better. What specifically can you do to improve the situation? ""Problems"" should exist in your mind just long enough to be identified

* I dropped my deadlift!!!!! *I need to do farmer's walks and pullups to make my grip strength less bitch-like*
* UGGGH fucking power cleans getting heavy
* Gotta squat and there's no racks *I can probably just punch the guy in the third rack and hang him on the dip station*

You get the idea. 

Don't stop the solution finding until you have an *actionable item*, won't stop. 

##POSTGAME

###The After Action Report
Keeping logs is important. If you have no idea where you are how will you know if you are going in the right direction? You won't

Review your logs

Reflect on the game. Did you learn anything? Is there something you can do better? Did your spotter point out that you fart in the hole while squatting. Fix your performance cues for next session.

Thank yourself for putting in the effort and giving yourself a great gift.

Hype yourself up for the next session.

* First meet! Saturday

I'm 17, just messing around on machines/dumbbells etc. and eating 3000+ calories.

Eventually I started SS when summer started. 

Lift #'s:

    Early May 2013 &gt; Late July 2013

    Squat:     205 3x5 -&gt; 270 3x5
    Bench:     145 3x5 -&gt; 175 3x5
    Deadlift:  245 1x5 -&gt; 295 1x5

Instead of doing M/W/F, 10-20lbs below my 5RM for each. Within two weeks I was hitting squat PRs every day and generally felt real satisfied.
My bench didn't fare so well, but gains nonetheless.

For about a month and a half my deadlift was stuck at 245. This was due to me being scared to go heavy, just me being a wuss. One day I just wizened up, put 265 on (my true 5RM) and pulled two sets of 5. After that, I started progressing normally.

**Meet Prep**

I was still making good gains but I had to lay off about 1.5 weeks out. Took my deadlift opener wednesday, and tapered my calories down to maintenance. (3600 -&gt; 2800kcal).

I tried doing a simple water loading cut just to see how much i'd lose, a good 5-7 lbs from my normal weight. Immediately drank gatorade + water and ate a whole bunch of food.

**The Lifts**

* Went 8/9 Sorry about 240p and shakiness

**Squat**

* [120KG - make: Way easy. Didn't realize I go this deep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRIy9Z5G2G0)
* 132.5KG - make: Easy. Could've opened with this.
* 140KG - make: Easy PR.

**Bench**

* [80KG - make: Easy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAh4aDovtTY)
* [90KG - make: Paused PR!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUNlCOIYruM)
* [95KG - miss: Too heavy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWgUEaHWi-I)

**Deadlift**

* 127.5KG - make: Went lighter than normal as I thought i'd be tired at this point. I wasn't.
* [142.5KG - make: Easy PR. Felt like a warmup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW3NWa16D4g)
* [152.5KG - make: Felt SUPER Easy

**Results**

* Totaled 382.5kg / 843.26lbs.
* Yes
* Easy PRs across the board

**Final thoughts**

* Back to my SS routine until my gains stop and I start stalling repeatedly. *Might* join another meet on either Sept 14 or Sept 28 depending on how things go. If not
* Buy a nice belt
* Do some research on how to improve my press (More volume? More accessory?)
* Need to do a DL form check to see if rounding is evident on lower weights
* ^ Fix Dl form. I've done self form checks at lower weights (aka glancing sideways at the mirror) and they've been fine but not this time

[This article](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/4_weightlifting_myths_destroyed) from T-nation reminded me of my ignorance and confusion today

**In other words: ""Break the bar"" and ""bend the bar"" are often prescribed as coaching cues: Do you use these cues and what exactly do they mean?**

Of course the hand should apply a maximum crushing grip on the bar. 

**Bench**: I've heard ""bend the bar"" as a cue for powerlifting style bench (So you think you can bench series, the 'horns' of the U towards your feet in a lateral direction; bend it as in applying a lateral pressure towards your feet? Or bend it in a vertical pressure towards the floor? 

**Squat**: Probably depends on high bar vs. low bar: Elbows under the bar is pretty well accepted

1357510620.0,162yrm,Observations on my Mobility Work,davidf81,51,7,31,"Disclaimer: I have no idea how much of this is obvious common knowledge

When I first began lifting in late 2011 with no previous meaningful experience (intermittently messing with machines), I noticed they would get some joints popping and feeling a little less stiff, but didn't seem to do anything for actually mobilizing me during training. 

Over the last year and a half, so that I can do whatever movements I feel like in the gym. I wanted to document some of my experiences here in case others might find it helpful. 

Foam rolling has always felt utterly useless. It feels like an OK warmup but doesn't seem to help my flexibility/mobility in any way. 

Old school static stretches just tend to reach a point of pain

I've found that dynamic stretches work best for me post workout. For example, triceps, and biceps, using whatever you'd call the method where you gradually increase the amount of stretch by ""bouncing"" against the muscles.I do not mean an aggressive bounce with a large range of motion, or even a fast bounce. I'll elaborate specifically for squats below, but I'll say here that the bounce is in a fraction of the overall range of motion and I've never performed it with weights exceeding about 2/3 my max.  I know that's fairly common for some types of stretches, I've found it works great for all of them

It call came down to forced stretches. As squatting got heavier on the SL5x5 progression, I could feel myself sinking into the hole, stretching, feeling pull in my joints and muscles. I began doing these paused squats pretty regularly, just 2-3 of them, during my 5x5, and within weeks I was naturally sinking deeper into my normal squat reps. 

I've since found lots of ways to get forced stretches on various muscles at various angles

1. Before squatting, back and forth, as far as I can, for a few seconds each.
2. During all my warmup reps, but simply drop into the bottom of the squat and let yourself sink as deep as you can. At warmup weights coming out of these squats isn't challenging. When I'm as deep as I can get in the hole on the first few, I will gently bounce my hips just a little. I'll feel a great extra stretch. I'm talking about maybe my hips coming up 0.5-1"" then dropping back to the bottom.
3. After my back squat warmup, normal execution. I find that this sequence leaves all my joints feeling warm and flexible, including my shoulders, hips, knees, etc.
4. Perform my 5/3/1 work sets normally
5. Perform my BBB sets
6. Perform a set at about 40% of my max for 4-5 reps as I did in warmup

This has worked wonders for my knees

Last Saturday (May 12

Competed in the 90Kg/198.4lbs class.

I'm 5'4"" and normally walk around 200lbs

Didn't get much sleep the night before (didn't bring my CPAP machine so my snoring constantly woke me up. Plus my hotel was located on a busy and noisy street) so I felt like crap all day.

* Squat: 220Kg/485lbs
* Bench Press: 140Kg/308.6lbs
* Deadlift: 187.5Kg/402.3lbs
* Total: 542.5Kg/1195.9955lbs

I had to leave early because I had to catch a Greyhound bus that would take me home (I live 1 hr away from the meet location) so I passed on the last 2 deadlift attempts. Also my lower back has been bothering me for weeks

* Probably going to try Smolov squat routine in a few weeks
* Bought an inversion table which should arrive next week. I hope this lives up to the claims and user experiences I've read
* Get leaner so it will be easier to cut to a lower weight class
* Train more often with paused bench

1334240819.0,s673a,Smolov Jr. Bench Report: 215 -&gt; 270,Its_Entertaining,43,0,45,"I know your first thought is probably holy fuck

**Backstory**: In September I ran a smolov jr bench cycle and hit a 20lb pr at 247lbs. Following that I began to get sick and lose weight which culminated in the beginning of december when I found out I was bleeding internally. I lost roughly 25lbs of bodyweight from the time of my pr to when I started recovering. After gaining a bit of weight back and starting creatine I entered the cycle weighing 230 and being able to bench 215. 

**The cycle**: Knowing that I would be able to gain some rebound strength back quickly I started my programming with a 235 1rm to generate my numbers. I used a custom spreadsheet similar to [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnYgzBT6dbEldFg1UVRMS2JHUTgybFNPaVA0aG5pMmc) for generating my daily workouts. My workouts were also placed as Monday, Friday. I struggled to finish the first week but could tell the strength was coming back. The following week I took a jump of 15lbs and actually started finishing stronger than the first week. The next week I was skiing so I took the entire week off and rested. The following two weeks I increased by 5lbs each week so my final day was 225lbs for ten triples. I only missed one rep the entire cycle and it was on week 4 day 4 in the ninth set. After finishing the week I took another entire week off because of medical appointments and Easter.

**Results**: Finally I was able to test my new 1rm, 135x5, 185x3 I began doing singles. 225 and 245 were fast so I jumped to 265 and nailed it. I then went for 275 and just missed. Reset for 270 and hit it better than 265. I wanted to try for 275 again but by now my shoulders were done and I called it a day. The final result was still VERY pleasing to me, a tested 55lb increase in 4 weeks of benching and 2 rest weeks. During this period my bodyweight went from 230 to 240 and there was a noticeable change in chest size. I plan on taking a couple more weeks rest and planning out my next program from there.

1323128053.0,n1qki,The truth about Pendlay Rows,Nevr2Big,43,2,21,"Ok
Here's the description written by the man himself; hopefully it will clear up some of the confusion about how to do this exercise and it's benefit.

""Rows: Well, no hip extension at all, all that bends is the middle back and the shoulders and elbows.

This is hard to do and you have to have good muscular control to do it, flexing it from both ends so to speak.

The bar returns to the floor after each rep. The bent row is actually best done as an explosive movement and the bar is moved fast. I have trained many people who could do this exercise with 350 or more lbs. I myself have done reps with 425, has done reps with over 500lbs without his back ever coming above parallel with the ground. That is stronger than Dorian Yates or Ronnie Coleman, by the way.""

Here's the takeaway points as I see it and have performed it since 2003:

1. No/minimal hip
2. Lower back is locked into extension (though it will look flat-ish from a side view.
3. The mid back (upper lumbar and thoracic areas) WILL be in flexion the rest position (hanging down).
4. Execute the lift by simultaneously flexing the mid and upper back while pulling the weight up to lower abdomen. At the top your back will take on a sort of flattened ""U"" shape (extension from top to bottom).
5. (most important!!!) Ignore the 175 lb ""trainer"" with the faux hawk telling you you'll need to keep your back perfectly still while doing a row. If you want to be nice to him, most likely.

Just some words from a (beginning to feel old) vet

The features that I've found especially cool are the automatic bar tracker and speed measurements. 

Let us say you have two videoes where you max out on deadlifts. For the sake of the example the video is shot from the side. Then you are able to put a marker on your barbell collar and it will automatically track the bar path. You can now easliy see if you arnt pulling in a straight line. For an experienced lifter it might not be that usefull but for a beginner it is a nice virtualization tool. It also makes it easier to compare you form if you are trying to make changes

##Pre-Meet    
I decided to do this meet about 2 months before the meet. I had been running Wendler 5/3/1 for about 4 months at that point. I haven't done a meet in about 6 years, but I decided to just go for it. I bought my bench shirt about a month out, which turned out to be a huge mistake. The squat suit I used was one I had laying around from high school. I used an Inzer lever belt and some Inzer Iron Wrap Z knee wraps. I had already been cutting for about a month when I decided to do the meet, and was about 235 pounds at that point. A week before the meet I was sitting at 229 and had to cut pretty hard to make weight. The day of the meet I didn't eat or drink anything, and ended up making weight by .1 lbs. I weighed in at 220.1. I'm pretty sure cutting that much hurt me quite a bit, and looking forward I will try to stay as close to competition weight as possible. 

##Meet Day    
This was my first experience with the NASA federation, but everyone was really nice. I competed in the 220 lb Equipped Junior Division, and was the only competitor in my class.  
**Squat**    
I set my opening lift super low because I was nervous and just wanted to be sure I could do it with no stress. The only warmup I got was 225x5 because I waited too long and the flight moved faster than I was expecting, so I went to 540 which would have been an all time PR for me. I got the lift, but I got called up just a tad early by my brother. It was definitely a doable weight, and I should have gone lower and gotten it.  

**Bench**    
Like I said, so I was hoping to beat this one as well. 320 went up as planned, so I went to what I knew I could do in my shirt fairly easy, 408 lbs. I got the weight, but my butt came off the bench so I was red lighted. I stayed with the same weight for my 3rd attempt, and I focused on slamming my butt into the bench throughout the lift. I was pretty confident that I got it, but got 2 reds for my butt coming off again. This is the lift I was most disappointed with, I had to kind of shake things off and get ready for deadlift.  

**Deadlift**    
Deadlift is by far my most comfortable lift, and decided to break the record of 567 lbs for my second attempt of 573. It was a bit of a struggle, but I was still feeling pretty strong. Attempted 601 for my 3rd but just couldn't finish the lockout. I had gotten 600 in the gym about a month prior to the meet, but I weighed between 230 and 235 at that time, so the cutting probably hurt me here.  

##Post-Meet    
I was pretty mad at myself overall with this meet. I did set some meet PR's, but I feel like I could have set all 4. I will definitely try to stick to my competition weight for the next meet, seeing as cutting probably affected me quite a bit. I also need much more practice in my bench shirt. All in all, I'm glad that I went but it just made me want to do so much better.  

If anyone knows of any meets coming near North Texas soon

***Background:***

•	Started lifting semi seriously in May 2011. Half assed Starting Strength for a while until I got bored of it then I tried to move onto 5/3/1. Going from half assing starting strength to half assing 5/3/1 didn’t go well at all and I lost a lot of ground on all of my lifts. At this point I got frustrated and pretty much stopped lifting for most of Nov and Dec 2011. I finally got my act together and went back to full ass starting strength Jan 2012 and hit it hard until I stalled out proper in March 2012. At that point I wasn’t too fond of going back on 5/3/1 and none of the other intermediate programs looked fun so, but I loved every minute of it. I ran Sheiko all the way from March to Oct 2012. In Oct I had to deal with some pretty major stuff (surgery, back problems, life changing family issues) so my lifting took a back seat to everything else. I had basically stopped lifting at that point. I didn’t get back into lifting until January of this year when I moved for work and started lifting at Detroit Barbell. I train with a crew there and the owner (Clay Brandenburg) tells me exactly what to do, so I just listen to him for my training now. 

•	This was my first meet. I had been trying to find a meet for a long time

***Pre-meet training and weigh-in:***

Like I said
As far as my weight goes

***Lifts***

Going in I knew what my openers would be

**Squat:** 

	407.9lb (185kg)

	435.4lb (197.5kg)

	457.5lb (207.5kg)

Not disappointed with my performance, but it went up much slower than I would have liked. Going into my third I wasn’t really feeling great, but I was ready either way. I got my hands and shoulders chalked and took a big hit of nose tork. Immediately following the nose tork one of my training partners took it upon himself to get me amped up in his own special way. I got the hardest (surprise) slap to the face that I have ever had in my entire life. That got me ready to go and I went for my third. My third was the longest grinder I have ever experienced in my entire life. It took a solid 10 seconds to go from the hole to lock out. I thought for sure they were going to take it from me several times, but they let me keep going and I ground it out. Going in I was hoping I would get another 10 or 20lbs on squat, but it just wasn’t there. I couldn’t have even done another 5lbs. 

**Bench:**

	264.6lb (120kg)

	286.6lb (130kg)

	314.2lb (142.5kg)

I wasn’t real confident going into bench, but it still went up easy. This is surprising to me now because 1) I haven’t touched anything higher than 285lb since I hit my last PR in Oct 2012 and 2) my last PR was 315lb which was pretty rough when I did it. Next time I’ll open up higher and hopefully hit a big PR.

**Deadlift:**

	457.5lb (207.5kg)

	501.5lb (227.5kg)

	529.1lb (240kg)

Went about as well as I thought they would go

**Overall:**

Went 9/9 on all my lifts for a 1300.8lb (590kg) total. Not too shabby for my first meet. 

***Comments:***

I had a ton of fun and I look forward to my next meet (probably APF Nationals in May). It was really nice that it was a meet put on by my gym so I know and regularly lift with all of the spotters and judges. That took some of the pressure off.

1370712340.0,1fxnkd,Modified Sheiko review,raingoat,52,13,22,"I just finished a run of modified Sheiko using #29

For those that aren't familiar with Sheiko, around 500 reps of deadlifts and 400 of bench press for a little over 420 tons of combined volume between these 4 lifts which accounts for close to half the total volume of the program.

Having fallen into a somewhat of a rut with programs and needing something that was fairly low intensity but could help me kill immense amounts of time in the gym Sheiko is what came through for me.

Bodyweight went from 123.9kg to 125.7kg with the following improvements to my lifts:

* Squat - 225kg to 245kg (+20kg)

* Bench press - 150kg to 160kg (+10kg)

* Deadlift - 255kg to 270kg (+20kg)

* Overhead press - 107.5kg to 115kg (+7.5kg)

* Front squat - 160kg to 190kg (+30kg)

With both the Overhead press and Front squat being tested about a week after the big 3 and at a BW of 124.5kg

I ran the following cycles #29 - #37 - #32 which are best described as introductory - volume- peaking. But also since I can't run anything without tinkering with it I made the following substitutions and changes:

* Bench was exchanged for Overhead Press
* Dumbbell fly's were exchanged with Lying Triceps Extensions
* Dips &amp; Overhead Press were exchanged for Bench
* Lunges were exchanged for Bulgarian Split squats
* Powercleans using a modified 5/3/1 scheme as Deadlift warmup.
* Superset every set of presses with 10 reps of band pullaparts

I was also advised to add back work which I did as it has a appalling lack of it compared to pressing. As the bulk of my pressing was vertical I also made the bulk of my back work vertical and used the following scheme for 3-5x10:

* Monday - Underhand lat pulldowns 
* Wednesday - Chest supported rows
* Friday - Lat pulldowns

For most of the cycle the Bench press got treated as assistance when It came up but I focused on hitting it fairly hard each time when it came around leaving me with a few rep PR's in the progress.
As for the rows and LTE's I focused on weights which were heavy but allowed me to hit all reps with decent form.

The main drawback of Sheiko I've found is that it's very intense on the low back leaving me often with a nasty low back pump and a need for excessively long sessions initially as the first sessions took just over 3 hours but it got worked down to meager 2 hour sessions as my work capacity rose and I adapted to the constant pump.

After running #29 I had to take ~10 days off as I was travelling leaving me feeling fresh when I got back into the gym and got rid of a good deal of aches that had accumulated due to being lazy with the prehab &amp; mobility work. Then due to school obligations I stretched #37 over 5 weeks leaving me with a smaller peak than expected as my accumulation had been too restful.

My advice for anyone that intends to run this is the following:

* Don't skimp on your foamrolling and mobility work
* Program some heavy upper and mid back work to offset the pressing and make sure it's not your weak link
* Program your maxes about 5% higher than your actual maxes if you aren't totalling elite or close to it
* Deload properly before starting the program it self and don't go into it with any aches or niggles as they will only amplify
* Eat a lot of good food and sleep as much as you can.

Raw division, 36 years old, 6 foot tall

Best lifts: 195kg squat, for a total of 532.5kg

(429 pounds squat, for a total of 1174 pounds)

Had to wake up at 6:15am to do the one hour drive to the venue, the guy who wrote the USPA rule book, was on site and clarified. As long as it’s a loose fitting t-shirt, it’s fine.

My strategy was to use my third attempts of my last meet in October as starting weights, but when I look at the video, it looks almost effortless. I guess this means I should push myself more at the gym to find out my true limits. It’s weird, in the last weeks I missed 215 pound benches, barely made 225 pounds, and in the meet I easily hit 242 pounds. I probably underestimate the fatigue caused by the working sets I do before doing heavy singles (running 5/3/1 for powerlifting).

Before the last deadlift, I’m adding 40 pounds and going for 500 pounds!” It felt heavy to get it off the floor, but then it went up like nothing. Really surprising. Makes me wonder what I could have done if I would have been as bold at the squats.

Overall, no ego trips. There was an incident with another lifter, where a spotter grabbed the bar too early on bench press, and the head judge let him repeat the attempt without much arguing. He got the lift on the do-over.

Best part of the day though was that I got to spend it with a cute girl that ended up deadlifting 315 pounds at 120 pounds body weight. :D",,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/189g6v/meet_report_uspa_west_coast_open_5325kg_877kg_bw/

The latter for me just means switching over to the usual push/pull pavel 3-5 guidelines w/ no olympic lifting.

I want to keep front squatting and back squatting, because I love deadlifting. However I'm not really sure how to incorporate this into a routine. I'll shut up now and just tell you what I was planning:


Workout A (all 3x5):

Deadlift
Front Squat
Overhead Press

Workout B (3x5): 

Back Squat (olympic style)
Weighted Pullups
Weighted Dips


Would front squats and back squats be better of if I switched them around? It seems to me that front squats would be easier to do on the same day as deads because of the focus on the quads

* 186cm (+1cm from last meet :o)
* Training 4-5x a week since January 2
* Train for olympic lifting primarily (I also do high-school only PL meets)
* Second WL Meet (2 PL meets under my belt as well)
* Paleo from January to about June, rice etc) edit: also whole milk
* Multivite, Optimum Platnium Pre before each workout
* I've been training so hard to try and get a 211kg or 215kg to qualify for Nationals or Provincials and I end up entering the competition with a 191kg training total


**Meet Prep**

* Not a huge amount of prep for this meet, I decided it's not worth dropping the weight for a short-term goal like this meet
* Cooked a simple rice + sweet potato mix the night before to chow on after weigh ins.
* Brought some bananas to snack on too, 1c blueberries drizzled in honey 30 min before I go to the gym (45m before lifting)


**The Lifts**	

Went 2/6 on my lifts

[Video of all 6 lifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKfw4jzb9GY)

**Snatch**

* 77kg - my opener
* 81kg - my other weakness is not fully extending and having to chase the bar forward
* 81kg - no lift

**Clean and Jerk**

* 98kg - training PR is 107kg. felt good
* 102kg - I think I missed this b/c I kept my front foot forward for too long after the jerk
* 107kg - pressout


**Results**

Walked out with a **175kg total** and (Technically) the #1 Junior in my class

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records

**Final Thoughts**

* Pretty disappointed in myself
* I was really working on getting a more consistent snatch and my nerves really messed with my head during that part of the compeition
* Next WL meet is February 9

[This](http://www.elitefts.com/images/PICTURES/yoke.jpg) is Jim Wendler.

Jim Wendler is probably best known around /r/weightroom as the creator of [5/3/1: The Simplest and Most Effective Training System for Raw Strength](http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?m=PD&amp;cid=114&amp;pid=2976). There are also several variations of the program including one for powerlifting and one for beginners. If you are doing 5/3/1 or want to do 5/3/1 do yourself a favor and buy the book. 

I have lifted weights off and on for about 10 years now (played football, did starting strength, did some westside template stuff, etc). 5/3/1 is the best program I have ever done. It is flexible enough to fit my schedule and my goals, and simple enough that I can put as much or as little though into my workouts as I want and still leave the gym having done something useful.

His training philosophies are simple and come down to not worrying about the details and just do the fucking work.

In addition to sitting around and writing some books

* Played football for the University of Arizona
* Strength and Conditioning Coach for the University of Kentucky
* Squatted 1000lbs

* Deadlifted 700lbs

As you can see

His [Blood and Chalk](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/klxy2/blood_and_chalk_the_compendium/) series is filled with valuable information

His [Elite FTS](http://articles.elitefts.com/tag/jim-wendler/) writing is also very informative.

**[Making Weight]**   
Wasn't too much of a problem. I had been bulking up for a strongman meet which happneed the weekend  
before this one. I had gone from about 194 to 202 over 6 weeks, but I was still worried so I took two 30 minute hot ass bath sessions. Weighed in at 195.5, so it was all good.

**408 - 3 whites** ... Felt good  
**[435.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkGb--4gKn4) - 3 whites** ... Heavy
**[445](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7eSYxMzqQ) - 3 reds** ... This was a fight
  
At this point I was tied for second out of nine
  
**Bench:**  
**[246](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgb9YWo1GWM) - 3 whites** ... A breeze.  
**[264](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iukmtHoad_Y) - 3 whites** ... The cursed number. My bench has been stuck here for a long ass time.  
**[275.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGRpRcjFGxg) - 3 whites** ... Curse exorcised. Will be sticking to the programming I kind of slapped together four weeks out and see if the gains keep coming. (10lb PR)  
  
There were some pretty huge benches going on. (375 for first place
  
  **Deadlift:**  
**450 - 3 whites** ... Pretty easy. Video only captured the last second so I skipped uploading it.  
**[490](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmn54L4WT2U) - 3 whites** ... A strategic choice. I chose to go with 490 to secure the 1200 total.  
I wanted to go for 500
**[500](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weTIjYdyYPA) - 3 reds** ... After the last attempt I knew I wouldn't make this one. I tried anyway because why not. 
   
Finished 4th out of 9. The guy behind me stepped up and crushed a 540lb deadlift
think 4th is too shabby. The first place dude was somewhere in the 1400s
Congrats to all those guys.   
  
**[Future Plans]**  
Today I started the Texas Method and I plan to stick to it for the next 12 weeks. It's a long shot but I'd like to total  
1300+ this year and squat 500. I'm also looking forward to the prospect of more bench gains... would love to bench 3 plates this year. Also,False,,t5_2ssmu,1364843396.0,,,t3_1bfqme

I was just thinking about this last night.  
Why don't they have safeties (at least for bench) at any powerlifting meets?  
  
A lot of the failed benches I see

After some searching, and my thoughts on each:

* Pinch points created - *The most likely explanation from my POV*
* Would have to adjust safeties for every lifter - *They do this for weights/rack heights
* Some guys are too wide for the safeties in gear - *If they can unrack it
* At high weights you'd break the pins - *They use stronger bars/equipment at meets because people are lifting heavy singles

1346178857.0,yz2yf,Meet Write Up: 2012 USAPL Bench Press Nationals (video),AdmiralVonBroheim,54,17,11,"I do not usually do these

When I began lifting 2 years ago as a bench press specialist, many failures and a few triumphs. I had the USAPL Teen American Record taken from me on three separate occasions because of immaturity and low self confidence. 2012 has been the best year for me yet, as of November I will be starting my third year of competitive lifting and will be lifting at my first worlds because of my win this past weekend in Palm Springs. Consistency is the most important trait, and confidence is the key.

I trained 13 weeks for this meet, and received training and programming from him via email (he lives in Illinois and I in Texas) It was brutal, in this Texas Heat and combined with working 2 jobs, I was balls to the wall this whole summer. I had many more downs than ups, there was actually a day I remember towards the end of July where I actually was near the point of tears in the gym and felt like stopping. Finances were tough, 2 jobs was killing me, and training was horrible. I was missing lifts and I was even sick at the same time. I dropped 15 lbs at one point this summer, how I felt,hungover, and crumble. Not until 3 weeks before the meet did things start changing

I've competed at one other national meet, it was in Palm Springs California at the nicest hotel in town. Great venue and set up. I'm going to try and keep this short.

I gained about 4-5lbs before the meet, a far cry from the paltry 314 I was 6 weeks earlier. I had 2 meals and about 3 liters of water in me, so strait outta bed after a nice dump I was probably 327. 330 was nice though. I was STRONG. The gameplan going in was this

* Open at a cake number, and it would set me up for a nice 17.5-22 kilo jump to my second.
* go for a PR on the second
* Based on how my second went either go 600 in my new shirt

This is how things went-

My last warmup was about 7 min before my opener

Finally after that I went and talked to my handler, way too loose like a tshirt in the sleeves. I had to send it back TWICE to get altered, never getting in it again, I brought it with me just in case I wanted to use it on my third.

It was screaming tight in the sleeves, lets take it for a ride. see if it will work"". I was surprisingly calm until I was on deck. Wrapping my wrists I went to my dark place, where the demons dance. A buddy of mine from Texas, a 700 lb bencher, came up to me right before and grabbed me by the head, looked me square in the eyes and said "" Alright Ryan, Dont fuck around with it. bring it down and take the squeeze. Take this for a ride and fucking handle it"" That's all I needed to hear. I hit two ammonia caps and controlled my rage. It felt light in my hands, so no lift

[Meet Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow4LKS2RoOM)

Summary:
I scratched and clawed and fought for 13 weeks for 3 lifts. 3 chances at a dream. I failed and missed lifts, I never lost sight and never gave up. I was consistent in my convictions and finished the fight. I triumphed in the face of adversity, and so can you. It does not take an extraordinary person to do great things, just someone with the want to.

My Next meet is a full power meet in November

[EDIT] Fixed the link

It's a fascinating article, and the athletes are constantly making excuses, and have been even as far back as the '50s. Back then it was about how those mean old Commies were jimmying the rules in their own favor. Ten to fifteen years later, it was steroids. The US has this rather hypocritical attitude towards steroids: you're not supposed to use them, because that would be cheating, but if you don't use them, you'll lose, they did not even use them properly then, with a definite system of training to work from

The other major problem the author sees is a consistent pattern of fear of injury and overtraining in American weightlifting. He refers to many cases where, in the name of ""saving it for next time."" Rather than start competitions with a heavy, but still manageable weight, say 93% to 95% of their max, American lifters start too light, and will occasionally pass on third attempts if they have already lifted sufficient weight to win. This was a problem as long ago as 1968 when Bob Bednarski, the finest American weightlifter of his day

Simply put, like they want to crush their opponents, like they want not merely a victory but a Roman Triumph, like they want to become legends, we will continue to lose on a regular basis and might as well start cheering for the Bulgarians, the Chinese, or the Russians,,True,t3_pkef6

1363711882.0,1alo0s,[Meet Report] Central Georgia's Strongest Man - LW Novice,gravitystorm1,41,5,23,"First things first, and the meet took place during a festival so there was carnival literally steps away.  
	When I signed up, I had never tried any of the events before the actual meet. I knew I'd need to work on some areas that I've neglected if I wanted to achieve my goal, so in addition to my current PL training I added more presses, push presses, cleans, and lots of heavier rowing. I'll elaborate more on my training methods after the PL meet I'm doing this weekend. 
	Weighed in at 200 on the dot. No problems here, and I came fourth. Not last - ~bonus~ 
	Now for the good stuff. There was a 60 second time limit on all events:  

  **Warning**: Turn your volume down if you don't want to hear my screaming parents.  

**[Log Press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mACKL5ycCIo) - 180lb Clean once press for reps (3 reps)**  

My best strict press is 185, so I had changed my mind thinking I wouldn't pull off a single rep. When it came down to it though, shit went down and I managed three reps. The video didn't capture the first rep, unfortunately.

**[Frame Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2C7TLHVgKo) - 450lb from 16"" for reps (14 reps)**    

Also quite different from regular deadlifting. The frame is basically like a wide-grip trap bar. I tried to see where I'd stand by maxing my rack pull a few weeks ago and topped out right at 450 (while being over-trained). I thought I'd get 3-4 at best, but at the time all I could think was to not waste the effort.

**[Yoke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6aM9WbCTm8) - 500lb Yoke 50' down and 50' back (40')**  

Did more poorly than I'd hoped here. I was still gassed and nauseated from the deadlift. They were taking about 30 minutes between events, lost balance a few times, and wasted a lot of effort each time I had to pick the yoke back up. Only made it about 40 feet total. Sad.  


**[Tire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w8-P_o5b3w) - 650lb Tire 5 flips down

A very fun event. Originally the tire chosen was going to be 500lbs, because they were right. Ended up getting 9 flips in the time limit, so I didn't finish. The reason was more lack of conditioning than lack of strength. Lost speed, so I couldn't be explosive on the extension, leaving me wasting time trying to wedge myself under the thing to try and finish the last few reps.

  
**[Atlas Stone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjSbkFmLjUI) - 225lb Stone over a 50"" bar for reps (3 reps)**  

Honestly thought I might not finish a single rep. Before the event I warmed up with a few reps on the 180lb stone, this thing was much easier to pick up. You can see I didn't really have the technique down, but there was a moment where it clicked and I got a few up over the bar. This video is cut short too, I ended up getting 3 reps. I feel that the added heavy rowing was a huge contributor to my success here.

All the people I know (and all the strongman guys I train with) tend to lift with some bend in their spine and lift a shitload of weight.

For those who don't like reading much

**Squat**

[227.5kg \(501lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAN)
[237.5kg \(523lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAO)
~~[242.5kg \(534lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAP)~~

I'm 10kg behind 1st place at this point.

**Bench Press**

[170kg \(374lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAQ)
~~[175kg \(385lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAR)~~
~~[175kg \(385lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAS)~~

I'm in a three way tie for first place.

**Deadlift**

265kg (584lbs)
[280kg \(617lbs](http://ustre.am/_1EFro:1bAL))
[292.5kg \(644lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EFro:1bAM)

Second place and a PR total of 700kg (1543lbs).

**Goals**

Going into this meet I didn’t quite know what to expect.  I dropped a weight class and the last raw meet I did at 181 was the inaugural raw nationals in 2008.  Comparing myself to what I did in the 198/205 class didn’t seem fair but neither did comparing myself to what I did four years ago.  Adding to the confusion

Even without a good base for comparison, this time in the 83kg class.  Second, set a PR total.  Third, set individual lift PRs.  Fourth, win and go for records.  I accomplished most of these goals.  I requalified for the Arnold, set PRs in the total and deadlift, and set a few national junior records.

**Making Weight**

I’ll try to be short.  I was close (within 1kg) 10 days out

Did the cut effect my numbers?  Probably, or I would have set a huge PR.  For peace of mind I’ll go with the former.

**Squat**

It’s fairly normal for the squat to drop with bodyweight as it changes the biomechanics a little bit.  I did expect to have some drop off based on how my training went too so this wasn’t a shock.  
In retrospect

**Bench Press**

The bench press also typically drops with body weight but my training went great.   At the meet I thought that my opener felt easy
About those misses

Now that I’m out of the meet and have a level head

**Deadlift**

Finally a good lift!  In training I had some struggles but solved all my problems the last week.  The problems arose from changing my technique.  The easy fix was going back to the form that led to my prior bests.  I really have to thank my training partner on the weight selection on the last one.  I was nervous about the jump but he told me that I had no reason not to go for it.  I had second place locked in so why not go for a PR total?  With that kind of logic

**Thoughts**

Now I'll compare myself to last year's raw nationals.  I dropped a weight class

The Question:  Does anyone know of any links, but she's nervous not about getting big, but losing enough fat to make a difference.  Yes, we both know fat loss = 80% diet, but it would still help tremendously to see that others have done this.

Below is a how-to on making and using sandbags. You can find it on bodybuilding.com
""Made new bags the other day. I didn?t see anything posted

**Items needed:** 

1. 2mil or 3mil construction garbage bags (I used 3mil) = $7 for 50+
2. Duct Tape = $3
3. Sand = $3 - $4 per 50lb bag
4. Army Duffle bag = $12 


**Steps:**

1. Pour desired amount of sand in 3mil bag. I did not pack it because I want the sand to move around a little in the bag. I made a 150lb bag
2. I then placed the sealed 3mil bags into the army duffle bag and closed all straps on the army duffle bag. 

And there you have it?..hehehe I made a 100lb

I live in NY. I did this around my block

the 200lb bag is mostly for squatting. 

The sandbags will give you the most versatility, including basic moves such as carries, rows, squats, rotations, lunges, and military presses.

We also do combos and complexes using other movements such as Turkish get-ups, clean, squat and press, and thrusters. 

We also combine walking with movements. This way we work on conditioning, and power, simultaneously. Try walking with a sandbag and every ten steps perform three to five reps of an exercise. Walk and squat, walk and bent-over row, walk and shouldering, walk and then clean and press. The possibilities are endless!

Two variations when using two sandbags at the same time.

Wanna work on power? You can throw your sandbag: squat and push throw, or you can pre-swing the bag before throwing it to gain some momentum.

1369689775.0,1f5qwj,How to Increase Power Clean and Power Snatch?,Yukers,40,3,30,"I'm a recent convert from University Rugby at Loughborough in the UK

My training has always consisted of squats, within the last 2.5 months I have incorporated more olympic movements, power cleans &amp; power snatches, preempting my change of sport and shifting the focus on dynamic and explosive power (as well as other more specific ab work and related movements.). Due to the late decision the University have delayed the transition until next year, In this time I would like to increase my numbers before my fitness evaluation and a programme is given to me.

In that 2.5 months though I have noticed that these lifts haven't increased as any much as I have experienced previously with any other lift. Granted, and that requires time, but I would have expected to see a greater increase. 

**My question is** how does one go about periodising these lifts to see progression? Similarly what supplementary exercises will increase the explosive strength of my lower back. Currently on my olympic days, 4x2 at 80% and 3x1 at 90%. On alternate days I mix up the rep ranges, going 3x3 at 70, 3x3 75% and 3x3 at 80.
Currently i do supplementary exercises of 5x4 front squats

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I am aware there are probably some flaws in my programming.

If it helps
Throw: 50 m (164ft
Power Clean 110 kg
Power Snatch 90 kg (198 lbs)

Squat: 200 kg (440 lbs)

OHP : 100 kg (220 lbs)

Best gym lifts: 161kg squat, but spread across different days. My last try at a 3-lift max out day was about 10kg below my individual maxes.

The meet was being held across town with a 2-hour weigh in, and got there a few minutes before the 9:30 weigh-ins were to start. This was my first meet, and my first time competing at anything athletic since junior high, so minimizing the odds of feeling panicked was part of the plan.

The warmup room was small but we managed to get a good rotation going between the 6 or 7 guys in my flight, 2 bars set up as a ladder and all the guys helping the next one set up the weight they wanted and everyone switching back and forth without any ego between the 250-350kg guys and the ones working up to 200.

My openers were based on the simple “whatever you can triple on a good day or grind out on a crappy one” suggestion

Bench is still my comparatively weak lift, and while it was sloppy (dropped too quickly and lost some tension right before the pause) it was light and just what I needed. Jumped 10kg and put that up as well, then tried for 115. Probably could have dug it out with a hip lift, but today it stalled halfway up. My gym-mate who was also doing the meet as a junior (21 year old tank) threw 140kg back up in the air like nothing, but got reds for moving to rack before the command; IIRC he added another 20 and crushed that too.

By the time deadlifts were starting I was already feeling pretty beat-down, just stood up and felt good. 185 (405lbs) is what I can comfortably single in the gym and that felt tough but I knew I was on track. Finished with a 195kg pull and managed a small smile at lockout which means I really should have just done 200+ instead :)

As for the meet itself, and no music, but you can tell they love the sport and want it to grow. There were no cockups and everything flowed quickly between lifters, flights, and events. The spotter available for bench handoffs was excellent, and the sides/back were in at perfect times for a few squats that needed a catch. It's hosted by the Air Force but oddly enough, nobody lifted in the Military classes and only one guy did Bench Only; everyone else was Junior or Open. A ton of my family and friends showed up which was really encouraging and gave me somewhere to reset between events. And most importantly for me

1354427528.0,14526v,"[Meet Report] 445KG total at 91.2KG body weight (93KG class) Some Japanese titled meet in Sapporo, Japan Nov 25, 2012 (also, cool to get some flair?)",Lodekim,19, first for anyone who just wants to see the lifts. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdFXrndTBDI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I didn't see a guide for how to post this, even though I'd like to, so I'm going to give it a try.  If I can't make it work I'll have to rearrange my priorities and get onto an intermediate program and make that work.

**Results:** So this is the most interesting part to me when I read meet reports, but it was a pretty easy second lift), and 120KG is going to take more consistent form for one.  My deadlift was shit.  

I've pulled 190KG in training without too much difficulty, and probably shouldn't have gone for 190 as my second attempt.  You may also notice in the second video my left foot slips.  I had baby powder applied to my legs and didn't clean my feet enough clearly.  That wasn't an issue on the third attempt, but I don't know if my mental state had anything to do with it or if I just didn't have the strength left in me.  Who knows.

My bench really needs some form work.  The 110KG lift was harder than it should have been because I let the bar come too low

I did take the silver in the 93kg category, and he tried 140kg on bench, no idea what he really could have done.)

**General Background:** I was a 250lb fatty with no real strength up until a year spent in China from mid 2010-2011.  Dropped down to 190lbs

At the end of July I tested my maxes in a gym in the US and hit 325lbs/235lbs/405lbs.  I then moved to Japan and getting consistent training, and basically wasn't approaching it correctly.  The first 2 months I was here I wasn't paying enough attention to form and my squats sucked because I was loading the bar too high on my back.  High volume/intensity pressing was working, but lack of sleep was what fucked that from going further.  The deadlift I can't really evaluate fairly, but I am going to have to adjust how I train it so I can pick attempts better.

The lack of sleep was probably my biggest downfall.  Not only for not recovering

My schedule still sucks for being consistent (occasionally staying late at work, so I am going to give a little more time with the CnP framework, but I have to adjust it to my schedule.  I would go on something like the Texas method but it's just too likely that I'll either be under-rested or unable to go on a heavy day, which would fuck it up pretty bad.  With this at least I can have a week where I go MTR and not have everything fucked up completely.

**Cutting:** I know everyone says not to cut for your first meet, basically just did water loading to drop the rest.

For my next meet I'll probably do about the same

**Goals now:** So I had a lot of fun and I learned quite a bit I think.  I'd like to be more competitive for best lifter at the next meet and hopefully win the 93KG class (Winner was 160/110/215KG).  I took an easy week after the meet

My first goal is to get my squat up to using 180KG for a singles workout (as in 10-15 singles at that weight with low rest).  I know it will take a while

I'm going to try to be as consistent as I can squatting 3 times a week but mixing up the types of squat.  Ideally I'll do regular squats once a week, and zerchers (primarily because my abs/low back feel like a weak point to me).  I've found in the past that I've made some pretty good gains by mixing up the type of squat.  When I tweaked my hip with low bar a few months ago I front squatted while I healed and my low bar squat was higher when I came back.  I'm also going to lean more heavily towards triples because I'm simply not strong enough to benefit from singles.  I'll keep them occasional for trying to feel out what numbers I should start with at a meet and on shitty days.

The bench is going to be pretty much all triples and all paused for the foreseeable future.  I need to get more consistent with form and I'm not going to do that without more volume.

1344310335.0,xsze3,Smolov Jr write up xpost from /r/fitness,MEatRHIT,45,10,28,"So here is my quick and dirty write up of my Smolov Jr Cycle:

**Beginning**: I started out with a 1RM [around 315lbs paused](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1487hYDtEzk)

**Program**: I ran [Smolov Jr](http://wkak.net/SmolovFAQ.htm) for the regular prescribed 3 weeks (+10lbs each week) and then another week at another 15lbs since I was having such an ""easy"" time in week 3. I have some of my videos of the work sets on my youtube page but was told I could no longer use my camera so I don't have any after week 1.

**End of Program**: I ended up my last 10x3 day (last Thursday I think) using 305lbs and it was insanely tough and probably shouldn't have done that day as my shoulder was perfectly fine up to that point but has been a bit sore since.

**New 1RM Video**: [Today I benched 350lbs for 1 with some left in the tank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu_LR60RSzg), which it did, but I may still have been able to lock it out.

**Shitty Excuses**: I had crap for sleep last night but that wasn't going to get better the rest of the week so fresh I could probably have gotten the 360. 350 was actually my end of the year goal so not bad for August.

**Training from here**: I'm going to taper the volume down rather than going straight back to 5/3/1 like I did last time I ran Smolov Jr. I peaked from 285-&gt;315 back in February-ish and it settled to ~300 a few weeks later, good mornings, etc.).

**Other stuff**: 

**Supplements**: [D-AA](http://examine.com/supplements/D-Aspartic+Acid/), Creatine, Whey, DS Craze or C4 (pre workout)... I think that is about it.

**Bodyweight**: floating around 200-205 @ 5'11"" after starting creatine back up

**Training History**: 180lb Bench Bro with fuckarounditis up to 1.5 years ago

**Other PRs**: Squat:435x1 Deadlift:525x1

**Meet**

220 @ 85 was good for third in the men's 85 open division. (Out of three

My coach was mostly running the meet, so picking your attempts actually requires you know how the meets works and what everyone else is taking. (Or more importantly what you think they'll take, since they can always change what's on the card.) Snatch went fine since a lot of people were taking similar attempts. I would have liked to open higher in the clean and jerk but I kind of mistimed my warmups. It probably worked out better that I didn't push it too hard though, since I ended up having to follow myself after each attempt. (Two minute clock instead of one.)

The 220 total easily qualifies me for the 2012 National University Championships

* The Mattoon Wendy's does not have $1 Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers. This ruined my traditional post-meet meal. They also lack $1 Double Stacks.

**Training Background**

I started 3 years ago with StrongLifts

**Day of the Meet**

I realized that my cut was not going to get me where I needed to be about a week out, my nausea eventually abated and I was just left with nervousness.

I had fruit and trail mix between sessions

**Lifts**

I competed raw in the 90kg (198.42lbs) class.  I think I weighed in at 87kg (191.8lbs)

* Squat: 57.5kg (126.8lbs)
* Bench: 40kg (88.2lbs)
* Deadlift: 100kg (220.5lbs)

**Lessons Learned**

* I need to eat more.  It's clear to me that I did as well as I did because I took away any eating restrictions on this day.  I could have deadlifted another 20lbs
* I need a belt of my own.
* My coach is awesome.

**Future Plans**

* Figure out some kind of sane eating plan that won't make me fat but will let me gain maximum strength.  I *was* stronger than the 8 year old in all my lifts
* My trainer has been invaluable.  He got my lifts up, got me the space and time to warm up, and helped me determine what my attempts should be.  I'm going to keep going back for more :)",,False,,t5_2ssmu,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/q7t19/meet_report_20120226_usapl_wa_state/

The prep for this meet was bit haphazard.  I got the flu about 5 weeks out from the meet and missed about 6 or 7 workouts and I went on spring break about 3 weeks out from the meet and missed 3 workouts.  
I don’t follow any named program that I know of, and back &amp; shoulders.  With this I lift 6 days a week, 3 of which are heavy days.  My rep ranges for main lifts didn’t exceed 6 since I started training for this meet in January.  My accessory rep ranges were higher, generally in the 7-12 range. 


My diet was pretty loose until about three weeks out.  While I was training, I aimed to eat as little carbs as possible.  I accomplished this by eating omelets for breakfast on the days I ate breakfast, about 6 or 7 grilled chicken breasts for lunch with spinach, and whatever lean meat they were serving and more spinach for dinner.  Whenever the dining halls weren’t offering anything healthy, I would have a protein shake or microwave some turkey burger patties that I made and froze and home and brought back to school.  The week before the meet I ate almost zero carbs and tried to drink between double and triple the amount of water that I normally would.  I ended up weighing in at 146.2 without having to any kind of hard water cut in the morning which means I can stay in 148’s for a while.


I totaled 1122


As for future plans


Right now my biggest priority is getting my deadlift up, I also noticed a couple form issues I need to fix. I had no idea my knees caved that bad when I squatted heavy or that my I lifted off the bench on my third attempt.


My main goal for this meet was to put up a decent total in 18-19 148’s and my mindset was just to get some numbers down because I intend to surpass them later on anyway

I had symptoms of both lateral and medial epicondylitis as well as cubital tunnel syndrome. My left arm was losing strength due to the nerve impingement. The pain and symptoms were most noticeable when I bench pressed. I tried a regiment of NSAID's (500mg Naproxen Sodium 2x day). I tried oral prednisone. I had a cortisone injection. Nothing worked. The pain came back. I cut the pressing movements to 65% to give myself some active recovery time. I eliminated a lot of exercises from my routine that caused elbow pain. The thing I wouldn't do was stop lifting completely. I wasn't willing to take time off. I worked hard for those gains and didn't want to lose muscle. Instead

Something else (unrelated) forced me to take 6 weeks off lifting. I couldn't go to the gym at all. The elbow pain went away. I lost a lot of strength but I worked back up very close to my previous numbers and the gains have been pretty linear on my way back up. 

This time around I am going to pay carful attention to pain and take a week off when I think I need it. I will no longer push through that kind of pain.

As a result I hold back a little in the tank on every movement; therefore, I'm not getting a full work out. I can't lift as heavy, and I take a lot longer to recover because I want to have all my energy. 

In the adjustable squat rack I know I can fail on any exercise and safely escape. I just drop it down an inch and it is safely on the rack. I give 100% on every movement

The same thing happens when I bench press without safety's or a spotter. I hold back and limit myself without the confidence to fail. Weights that I feel I struggle with with no spotter I can struggle through and not worry about with a spotter. I have done the roll of shame before

**The Meet**

I cut from 212 to 198lbs in 1 week for this meet.  I got pretty close to my best performance except on the squat because I had some squat singles misses in training and it made me a little too cautious.  The bench commands and the fact that it was paused really threw me off and I wasn’t able to hit my gym PR of 285.  

The squat was a 20lb PR and the deadlift was a 25lb PR over what I’ve done in the gym.  Based on projected 1RMs from my workouts


The highlight of the meet was the $1 deep tissue massage I got back stage on my knotted left rhomboid before deadlifts.  The worst part of the meet was the fact that they combined the morning and afternoon sessions into a +8 hour long 7am session and I didn’t bring nearly enough things to eat.  A few guys liked my Inzer lever belt and I let them use it for their attempts.  

I ended up placing second from last in the raw open division.

**History**

~1 year of training – 3 months of SL5x5 and then 10 cycles of 531.


I made the mistake of switching to 531 too early in my training when I could have milked gains out of Madcow or the Texas Method.  I did a Smolov base for squats and a Smolov Jr for bench after my 4th cycle and then went back for my 5th cycle immediately after that.  After 3 cycles my squat and bench strength dropped off again and I’ve been struggling to get it back.  /u/nomediocrity has a pretty good [write-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13th1y/choosingtweaking_the_right_lifting_program/) on exactly why you should not do what I did.  


**Future Prospects**

After my 10th cycle of 531 I switched to the Texas Method (starting my 3rd week on Wednesday).  I plan to do that for 12 weeks and see what kind of volume I can handle.  My long-term goals are to total 1300 (300/450/550) and get swole.",,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/146d1f/meet_report_usapl_2012_american_open_policefire/

1344134376.0,xp558,[Meet Report] USPA Rocky Mountain Regional Championship 8/4/12,failon,36,6,20,"My primary goal going into this meet was twofold. First, I'm satisfied. I have a lot of room to improve before November and a solid plan on how to do it.

I weighed in at 117.5kg/259lbswent 5/9 and totaled 625kg/1377lbs with the following attempts:

Squat: [200kg/441lbs](http://youtu.be/wvH_L097XLs)

Bench: [120kg/265lbs](http://youtu.be/Twun6nHODG8)

Deadlift: [245kg/540lbs](http://youtu.be/dDAv20FCDyo)

**Preparation**

Preparation for this meet began in earnest 16 weeks out. Almost immediately my mild, bodywork, and technique modifications, I eventually got to the point that I wasn't in pain when lifting or working about 5 weeks out. I did lose strength and weight during this time, running a low-intensity 5/3/1 for the big 3 until I was feeling enough to do a brief period of high intensity, low volume work to ramp up for the meet.

The night before the meet I did do my characteristic 30-40g creatine bloat and reinforced my previous experience that this produces constipation and does a good job of keeping me from crapping my pants on the squat. Good thing too

**Squat**

Warmups were short and sweet, one of the judges pulled me aside and warned me to clearly have my knees locked before starting the squat. For my third attempt, I was again all sorts of shaky, briefly locked my knees (so I thought) and got the squat command from the head judge. 529 felt light in the hole and the judges said depth was good, but the side judges red lighted me for not having my knees locked out, despite having received the command to squat. But the weight came up and felt strong, so I'm chalking it up. The 507 was a meet PR over my previous best of 475.

**Bench**

Bench was about par for the course. Warmed up to 245 before opening with 264.5, brain?) I missed it in my typical fashion, left shoulder shutting everything down once it hit a sticking point. Missed it again on the third attempt, almost exactly the same.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift is where I am strongest, but my foot wobbled in my shoe and I lost all stability and missed the pull at my knees. Third attempt at the same weight I tightened my shoes, rallied myself and pulled the weight for a 5 pound meet PR. Not what I wanted, but I broke 600 again, so I'm happy.

For the curious, but because I had been wearing the orthotics for so long and training heavy loads with them, I found recently that removing them was detrimental to my leg drive. Something about afferent input from the bottom of the foot affecting neural drive to the rest of the leg. So I pull with the orthotics despite the extra height and instability. For this coming training cycle, I'm going to invest in some wrestling shoes that fit my inserts so I can at least be more stable with the orthotics.

**Summary**

It was a really small, but that's why I'm going to IPL Worlds in November.

I met some great dudes

Now to gain 15 lbs in 12 weeks...

I messed up my back about 6 weeks out while getting out of bed. About this time I decided to deload on squat and deadlift and focus on bench via Smolov Jr (run over 5 weeks). It worked; my back is fine

I didn’t bother with cutting any weight as there were only 2 weight classes (over and under 100kg) and I was well and truly in the lightweight class.

**The Lifts**

**Squat**

* 130kg - Red/Red/Red. This was an easy lift
* 130kg - White/White/White. One of the spotters was coaching me through the whole thing and recommended taking this again to work out the nerves. Went up easy.
* 140kg - White/White/White.

I’m a little disappointed in this. I feel like I left maybe 10-15kg on the platform

**Bench Press**

* 95kg - White/White/White.
* 100kg - White/White/White. Previous touch and go PR. Felt so light I nearly threw it through the ceiling.
* 110kg - White/White/White. +15kg from my pre-Smolov Jr paused PR. Felt incredibly easy too.
* 120kg - Red/Red/Red. Drove it off my chest just fine

Totally pleased with this

**Deadlift**

* 165kg - White/White/White.
* 180kg - White/White/White. Previous training PR.
* 195kg - Red/Red/Red. This was all sorts of messed up. Glute freaked out on me while trying to break the ground

Mixed feelings about this. 180 felt easier than the last time I pulled it and I definitely have more than that in me. Disappointed that 195 wouldn't even break the ground

**Total: 430kg (946lb) @ 79.4kg (174lb) bw**

Edit: Results have been released. I got 11th out of 15 men overall with a 284.32 weighted total. Compared to the first place winner who went 270/185/275 for a 434.5 weighted total.

**Lessons Learned**

* Warmups. For squat and deadlift
* Push yourself. This is a big one. I think it was a combination of nerves and babying my injury a bit
* You’re going to hurt. I haven’t felt DOMS like this in a while. Felt ok last night
* Nutrition. I did a lot of research over how to approach this. I settled on some stimulants in the form of caffeine and DMAA at the start of the day
* Conditioning. The bench and deadlift moved much quicker than I anticipated. Especially that 4th attempt. I think that contributed a bit to form breakdown in the deadlift. Time for me to hit the prowler...

Now the thread above touched on the Klokov (or snatch grip BTN) press and its technique. A bunch of people in there said how they had done the Klokov but really didn't get much merit from it, my press from the front went *down*. Shoulder-wise I saw no changes either (whether size or density wise), so if you're in the game for hypertrophy, just do regular BTNs. I know Jamie has a huge hardon for them, but I honestly don't see why at all. 

I rarely do regular BTN presses (the seated type where you go down to about ear level), but I'm going by descriptions from articles that were written when Barry White was topping the charts so it's hard to say, and they must've only done them if they had any sort of carryover to the press.

1. Total 1000 lbs. I set this goal back in January when I originally signed up for the meet.

2. Hit PRs on each of my second attempts. This would give me a chance to harness ""meet magic"" for my third attempts across the board.

3. Have fun and learn what it's like to lift in front of a large group of amazing athletes.

I'm going to break this post into a few parts. First, to some extent, life.

All videos are forthcoming. They're on my friends phone so he needs to email them to me (since they are larger than his allowed message size).


**The down and dirty**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWaJpwgEOtE

**Squat** - I went raw modern. Sleeves


-300 lbs (3 greens) - conservative opener. I rode a linear progression train into 295x3x5 (which I hit last Weds.) so it's been forever since I squatted with fresh legs. I hit 315 last Friday

-325 (3 greens) - 10 lb PR at the time. Lost my chest a little bit but the bar flew out of the bottom.

-350 (3 greens) - 35 lb PR prior to the meet, and a great goal achieved.


**Bench** - wrist wraps and belt.


-215 (3 greens) - another conservative opener. Easy hit.

-235 (3 greens) - 5 lb PR

-245 (3 red) - I lost my tightness at the bottom as the bar hit slightly higher than I wanted. I think I could have easily hit 240 but


**Deadlift** - no shoes

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn80hxhDLNQ

-415 (3 greens) - This weight FLEW off the platform. My buddies came up to me and said I looked shocked at the top due to how light it was. This was another conservative opener.

-460 (3 greens) - 5 lb PR

-500 (3 greens) - 45 lb PR and 40 lb PR for the day. What a fucking rush. I put myself in a dark place (parents divorce)


**Meet Prep**


I weighed myself last night and was at 199-200, but made sure to eat fairly carb heavy the two days leading up to the meet.


**Recent Training**


Back in January I deloaded my squat to 185x3x5 and rode a 5lb/session linear progression through until last Wednesday when I hit 295x3x5. I ran 10lb/session 1x5 DL linear progression and texas method press concurrently. I eat IF with carb cycling and bike approximately 20-40 miles a week commuting. I get adequate sleep and eat clean. I work out with a bunch of competitive lifters at Cambridge Strength and Conditioning so we always lift in an electric atmosphere.


**Post-meet Thoughts**


I need to focus on squat and bench form. I need to keep a prouder chest on squats and start pause benching more. I'm going to add a ""light"" squat day on Weds. but continue to ride linear progression as long as possible.

For those of you thinking about competing


**My Recommendations for Prospective Competitors**


-Don't change ANYTHING. If you train in sleeves

-Have a handler (preferably who lifts). It's always nice to have someone to give you a second opinion on your next lift, and to hold your ipod when you take it off.

-Bring food and water. My snack of choice was beef jerky and shortbread cookies. Meets are long

-Be conservative with your openers. You are going to be so juiced up. The last thing you want is to adrenaline dump and bomb out on squat.

-LISTEN to the commands. I saw countless lifters (good lifters at that) miss lifts because they didn't follow commands. My opinion: focus on the commands


**My General Musings**


For those of you who think you don't have the time, I think you're a fucking liar. I went from a 185 lb squat to 350 in 2 months with nothing but hard work, clean diet and adequate sleep. Too busy to do that? Bullshit. I work 30-40 hours a week in my lab, teach, take 8 credits of class at night, volunteer on mondays and have to go into my lab on weekends. I also bike commute and am studying for the MCATs. If I can find time to do this, ANYBODY can. There is not secret formula. Oh, get a few slaps on the back and slam some fucking bars. You can achieve anything you put your heart and soul into. Be fucking epic.

For example on bench/row day I'll add 5x10 cable crossovers and 5x10 chinups; or 5x10 incline bech and 5x10 seated cable row. You get the idea.

Is this a decent way to go about it,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,t3_12kozu

This is however where I'm somewhat confused. I have never had much luck when going for strength rather than endurance on ab exercises.

**What I learned**

* Knurling at a black iron gym will rip your shit up. I was not expecting that

* I reaaaaally need to wear more deodorant at events where I have to perform. A combination of nerves and exertion left me with some exquisite BO

* There is only one thing more humbling than seeing a SHW bench 450 raw

* Getting 3 medals for essentially showing up makes me feel a strange mixture of foolishness and pride (I was the only person competing in my weight class in both unsanctioned bench and unsanctioned deadlift

* Structure and slow but steady progress works for me (SS has taught me more than just how to lift) -- I hope to apply this to going back to university in the fall.

* I set minimum goals of 1xBW bench and 2xBW deadlift for this meet. I learned that I really don't know my body as well as I thought when I missed 190 and crushed 390. It also may have something to do with the unique feeling of competing in front of a crowd: Nerves can make you fail

I chose the deadlift for the simple reason that it's what our mascot/logo up in the top left appears to be doing. I'll make the next weeks thread based on either suggestions in this thread or whatever lift I happen to be thinking of next wednesday. :)

So

* Do you have deadlifts of any variety in your program at all? (I think any exercise where you're lifting something from the floor to atleast waist height counts, but you're free to disagree)

**Background and Training**

I started lifting approximately 14 months ago, then did a bit of Texas Method style training (not exactly).  This was my first meet.

Lately I've been doing 5/3/1 while cutting for the BTFC, but I just didn't have enough recovery/energy to be able to handle it.  After a month on that I changed my deadlift training to 5/3/1 as well.

I lost 22 pounds for the [BTFC](http://reddit.com/r/btfc)

**Meet Prep**

I did some maxing out a couple weeks ago

I took a full week completely off the week before the meet


**Lifts**


**Squat**  

Attempt 1: 275.5 lbs (125 kg)

Attempt 2: 303 lbs (137.5 kg)

Attempt 3: 319.5 lbs (145 kg)

I came into the meet hoping for a 310 lbs squat

**Bench**

Attempt 1: 187.2 lbs (85 kg)

Attempt 2: 203.7 lbs (92.5 kg)

Attempt 3: 214.7 lbs (97.5 kg)

Bench was a little disappointing only because I wanted to go 9/9, I stopped training with a pause (dumb) because I was feeling annoyed at not being able to lift as much.  Also, my ass was definitely off the bench so it would have been red-lighted for that anyways.

**Deadlift**

Attempt 1: 325 lbs (147.5 kg)

Attempt 2: 380.2 lbs (172.5 kg)

Attempt 3: 413.2 lbs (187.5 kg)

Deadlifts!  *Fuck yes*.  These went so well.  If you look close you can see me start laughing after my third pull.  I hit a 8 pound PR on my deadlift

**Results**

My total was 425 kg/936.4 lbs (303.1 wilks), so it definitely surpassed my expectations.  That deadlift PR really made the meet for me.  I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep cutting or if I'm going to start bulking, but I'm going to eat everything in sight for at least a week.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1fkd88/meet_report_uspa_mn_state_championship/
