1332894143.0,rgpse,My Guide for Noobs in LDing - Beginner Techniques,gorat,1892,340,362,"*Disclaimer: People that have been LDing consistently or want to add something

I wrote a new [noob guide to dream control](http://redd.it/rk8te) with more in-depth stabilization techniques - check it out for when you have your first LD.

And a [guide on how to do cool stuff in dream](http://redd.it/rkelb) with tips on how to summon things

Also if you are afraid of Monsters and Sleep Paralysis

-------------

**Intro**

So - you have heard about this great thing called lucid dreaming (LD) where people fly around, see anything their brains can imagine. You are in the right place, and you are in luck! You can learn to do this at will!

sit back

*Beginner Techniques - Having your first lucid*

First of all

The easiest way to get lucid in a dream is while you are dreaming naturally. What happens is that at one point during your dream you wonder if you are sleeping. If you can *prove* to your brain that this is the case then you become lucid. But how do you prove it?

**Reality Checks**

RCs are tests you can do quickly of which the outcome is so hardly ingrained in your brain that you will instantly know if they fail. Surprisingly your sleeping brain cannot recreate the real behaviour.

Things that **work**

* Count your fingers (it's hard to focus and count in the dream.)

* Push your finger through the palm of your hand. ([yes!](http://aluciddreamerslife.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/fingerthrupalm.jpg))

* Hold your nose shut and take a deep breath.

* Try to read anything or tell the time from a watch 


Things that **don't work**

* Ask someone (try it in real life - you will get the same response)

* Pinch yourself (you can feel pain in dreams if you are not lucid)

* Turn lights on and off (sometimes works but not consistent)

**But I don't normally count my fingers!**

One of the problems with reality checks is that they are not things that you would normally do during daytime

* do a RC every-time you talk to someone during the day

* do a RC every-time you pass through a door

* do a RC every-time someone calls you


The idea is to create a reflex in your brain. Door -&gt; look at hand -&gt; question reality. Pick the one you like best (I prefer looking at my hand and counting fingers) and do it a few times during the day. Think of LDing while you do.

**Priming your Sub-conscious**

Your sub-conscious brain is what governs your non-lucid dreams. If your sub-conscious wants you to LD then it will present you with huge dream signs to try and tell you that you are dreaming. Dream characters will tell you so! This **combined with Reality Checks** is the best way to induce LDs.

How can you make your sub-conscious more friendly? Every person knows themselves best but some techniques that may work are strong affirmations ""I will LD tonight!"" repeated as you fall asleep, and one of my favourites ""visualization"".

**Visualization (Dream Incubation)**

Do you daydream? You should!

So daydream during the day about a place you want to be in your sleep. Make it very specific, the smells, the sounds. Close your eyes and fantasize about it. Don't put any other people in the scene. Imagine only a place. Do this as often as you can during the day. Don't talk about it, just imagine how it will be without words in your mind. Dwell on the feelings it gives you. Open your eyes and do a RC!

So before you go to bed

**Stabilizing**

You did a reality check and you are dreaming

If it's your first time you can get really agitated and anxious/happy and the dream will start dissolving. Rub your hands together! Calm down

Rubbing hands stabilizes. Touching things and savouring their texture stabilizes. Tasting things stabilizes. If the dream is really dissolving spin fast around your self for a couple of times. This should also stabilize the dream.

**Outro**

So remember: **REALITY CHECKS** throughout the day (pick one and do it, **STABILIZE** as soon as you attain lucidity

Happy dreaming.

**PS**:You go to sleep normally! Don't fight sleep

What's up, but mostly their problems. Some were big and clunky, most were hard to use, and all were unreasonably expensive. It was from this conversation that Remee was born - a comfortable, affordable lucid dreaming mask. Here's what we'd love for you to know about Remee:


* It's comfortable. We wanted to make the experience of wearing Remee while you sleep as pleasant as possible - unencumbered by extra buttons and controls

* It's customizable. 6 high quality LEDs run across the back of Remee, all options for light patterns and timing are set using a web app rather than clumsily handled by on-board buttons and controls. (This is one of the coolest things about the mask - watch the video for a demo of bitbanging your settings!)

* It's hackable. Remee is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. If you're so inclined

* It can look however you like. The base model comes in 5 colors that we agonized over for weeks before finally flipping a coin, using a really cool process called [dye sublimation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sublimation_printer#Textiles), you can have basically any image you want printed to the front of your Remee, high quality, without fear of peeling or fading.

* It's obtainable. The number one turn off of the older style lucid dreaming masks is the price - often $500 or more. We're kickstarting Remee at $80 for the base model. The NASA ones are $100

All in all, we're psyched about the prospect of bringing lucid dreaming to a larger group of people. We think it's pretty dumb that something so profound, so useful, so *fun*, is something a lot of us would be embarrassed to bring up in mixed company. We're happy to answer any questions you have below, and hope you'll support our kickstarter

The hardest part for me is actually waking from the alarm so I recommend maybe more than one alarm. Once you are awake

Just go downstairs for a bit

2. Write down what you want (You want to lucid dream, you need to write down what YOU are going to do and how you are going to do it. The more details you can add the better. You can also add how you will recognize you are dreaming.

1. **Begin keeping a dream journal**. Any time you wake up

2. **Begin doing reality checks**. Do these *24 hours a day*. (Yes. Especially while you are sleeping.) 30 or more should be enough. [Really

3. **Begin practicing MILD**. Before you go to bed, see yourself in the dream you picked noticing the dream-sign. Upon noticing the dream sign, do a reality check. See yourself becoming lucid. Then continue visualizing what you plan to do once you become lucid. Condition yourself this way so that you expect it to happen and the training kicks in as automatically as catching a line drive and throwing it to second base when there is a guy on first, 'cause you don't want to miss a double play like last time. And the pitcher is Jeff from fourth grade but he is still 10 years old. That's weird. Note: This is best done in the early morning when you wake up.

*A few notes before I begin my story, but it only got diagnosed when I was 14-15,  but for most of my childhood I was just diagnosed as “eccentric”.
My mother is also a therapist (specializing in addiction).*

Anyway on to the story, consuming you alive), to this day I still remember most of them.

As a baby and a small child, I stopped sleeping almost all together, all energy drained away. At first my parents though I was sick and took me to the doctor a couple of times until they finally realized I had stopped sleeping. My sleeping pattern before that was mostly hidden catnaps during the day, so it took a while for my parents to find the problem.
After some questioning from my mother the truth finally came out about my nightmares and having some knowledge of psychology she suggested my teddy polar bear would protect me. According to her I instantly rejected this suggestion
At this point she grabbed an old fable (we both couldn't figure out which one it was) about a hero
As you might suspect the young hero slayed a few dragons and killed a few monster until he came upon an evil witch who cast doubt in his heart
Of course this made the hero doubt and die a useless death against the witch's monster.
After this I commented the hero was stupid, so there was no reason for doubt. My mother quickly batted it back, by telling me that I was stupid as well, because I refused to believe in the power of my teddy bear.
This clicked well and next time I fell asleep

This was the start of me directing the course of my dreams, I started to teach myself to read. Soon my dream enemies were becoming smarter and scarier as they were inspired by the tribulations and foes described in my books. So the day came there was an enemy my polar bear couldn't beat, he could only hold him in a stand still. Now during this time I was also reading Greek and Norse mythology with my mother, so I had a good idea. I told my bear to flee with me to the dwarfs where I would (with the help of the dwarfs) smith an armor and weaponry for him.

This was the first time I myself actually changed the dream directly and through time I started doing more and more. I crafted armor and a sword for myself and aided my bear in battle and soon enough I didn't even need the help of props to direct my dream, flying through the cosmos or eating enough candy to fill a large lake.

Now this was a slow process, so I barreled through life trying to be as normal as possible, not realizing I was bombarding my senses with much more than they could handle. As a result of all that stress I started to act out in anger, I didn't fight other people or start making scenes in public. I would sequester myself in my room and start punching the walls and scream like a little madman.
After one day I punched a hole into my bedroom wall into the bathroom
My father taught me to take a walk when I started getting angry and my mother tried to teach my to count to ten or other such techniques. Now these approaches are valid and good ways to handle anger, until my mother finally found a way to help me calm down.
I was to control my breathing, it works). This worked wonders as this would help me close of to the outside world.
At first this happy place was merely a small rock to sit on while my feet dangled into water, a fine mist was overlaid on the lake I hang my feet in, etc.

As I continually enforced this image in my mind, chopped down trees to create a clearing for my bear, the lake changed into the lake surrounding Avalon. I learned a lot during these dreams, I could just snap whatever I wanted into existence, but I found if I did this, it would be unstable, disappearing next time I was there, I dreamt up an axe and cut down the clearing for my bear.

When the place by the lake was more or less finished I decided I wanted to do more
So I began reading psychology books my mother had laying around, I got to work.

First off, and we'll remove any that appear here - there are numerous reasons for that, most of them have been summed up in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/qmlts/ban_memes_in_rluciddreaming/).

And now to the fun stuff! So you just found out about lucid dreaming, and you'd like to try it. Good news, we've been collecting good sources of information in the sidebar, so if you have any questions, or you'd like any help, refer to these guides first - that's not to mean you should be afraid to ask questions, quite the opposite! Just that there's a lot of dangerous misconceptions going on (even in threads on /r/LucidDreaming, and these guides are a great source of information.

So, but in my experience, they were mostly just rehashed or mangled versions of existing techniques, so again, please rather read the guides than a random image you found. Lucid dreaming is an activity that's usually associated with mysticism and the paranormal, but it's actually a quite well researched scientifically sound phenomenon, and there's nothing dangerous about it - or about lucid dreaming itself, or getting addicted to it, a lot of people have experienced a lucid dream even before they knew anything about lucid dreaming.

But for those who haven't and would like to try it (such as myself and majority of people, most popular are:

* Dream Journal

It's a notebook where you take down what you remember from dreams - it helps to improve dream recall, one important thing: You dream every time you fall asleep, usually about six or seven dreams. You just forget it *really* quickly, one time I managed to forgeteverything but the number ""3"" before I got from bed to my table to write it down (the lesson: have your Dream Journal by yourself when you wake up).

* Reality checks

These are pretty much essential, reading text, waiting and then checking if it changes...

### Techniques

 [WILD](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Induction_Techniques#WILD)

The gist of this one is going to sleep, and more often than not, you find yourself in sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is something that happens every time you fall asleep, and it happens when your brain severs the connection to your muscles, so you don't act out what you're doing in your dreams (and knowing why you guys want to try lucid dreaming, this wouldn't end up good, teehee). You basically wake up, but you're unable to move. Scary stuff. However

Anyway, and it's immensely interesting, but it's just very hard. That's not to drive you away from it, just expect to fail often, and it takes often weeks until your first successful LD.

[MILD](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Induction_Techniques#MILD)

Before you go to bed, and realize I'm dreaming. I'm going to sleep, look at my hands..."" It's a beginner method, but it's not as effective as WILD - still, this is probably the way to go if you're just starting out.

This method also includes doing reality checks - you associate something (opening a door, and you do a lot of reality checks during the day. The idea is that this will then carry over into your dreams, you'll do a reality check in your sleep and realize you're dreaming.

(Notice that I didn't say anything about drugs that should help with Lucid Dreaming - simply, or alter the dream in a bad way - and it all relies on your mind and these techniques anyway, so you're probably better off without them. Oh, and weed often makes people don't have/remember any dreams, so that's likely out too.)

So, you can do anything! But if you still don't know what to do, here are some tips: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Using#What_you_can_do

You can go further. The best part is

I mean it. Do nothing. As soon as you've stabilized yourself in your dream body using your favorite technique (I like spinning around with my arms out) resist the temptation to create some new fantasy. Instead, scary or repulsive the dream story gets, ignore it with calm dispassion. Cultivate this mindset: You are the dreamer. Nothing can harm you. Nothing can distract you. **Do not get involved in any story. Do not create any story.** Story distracts and takes away your power.

People will approach you with beautiful things to look at, or eyes to fall in love with. Pay them no mind.

**Sit down calmly wherever you are and absorb yourself in the most mundane details of the environment.** Reach out and run your fingers over the ground. Feel how real it is. Notice how you can feel every tendon in your hand as you touch it. Bang on it. Notice how the vibrations move through it in exactly the right way. If you're outside, a passing jet plane. As ordinary as can be.

After a few moments of calm, no detectable difference between the world you're seeing and what you normally refer to as the waking world. Try your reality tests. They'll pass.

What you do at this point is up to you. Revel in the miracle of sensation. Ask the dream world pointed questions about the meaning of your life and destiny. I usually call out for my dream teacher. He shows up and gives me a new lesson about my mind, or the waking universe — sometimes forcefully.

You may find it difficult to wake up from this state. Try not to be afraid. You will eventually.

**Backstory**
My Mom and I had no real relationship for most of my life. She left my Dad when I was a baby and at 6 months old I was sent to live with my father's mother (Momo). Despite the fact that I had a strong female influence in my life I always wanted to know and love my mother. Momo just wasn't my Mom despite how hard she tried. 

I met my Mom when I was 20. I had never been so happy. She wasn't everything I imagined but fortunately I had learned through pitbull rescue that you can't always make something into what you want. You must accept and move forward. My mother was mentally ill and addicted to anything that could be addictive

When she killed herself

About three weeks ago I had my first lucid dream. I looked around, well, since I'm dreaming what is the thing I want most in the world?... I want to see my mom. 

So I did. She flew in on a boat no less. After she got off the boat we just hugged. She looked exactly like the last time I saw her. She was beautiful. I finally pulled away and I was crying. She looked at me

1359412205.0,17gffp,PROPER USE OF MELATONIN (please upvote),Forevernade,778,247,141,"Proper use of Melatonin REALLY NEEDS TO BE IN THE FAQ!

Physiologically

Yes, it is a hormone, and is as powerful as one in it's respective effects (think of testosterone for your sleep).

If we look at the circadian rhythm, higher doses have a different function.

As the night continues on and you remain in darkness melatonin is produced at a higher and higher rate until maximal melatonin levels are reached in the morning around dawn. High doses of melatonin (e.g. 5mg) drastically increase REM sleep^2 (where you dream) and some other cool things which are helpful for LD. Ever wondered why you most often remember your dreams in the mornings? 

Now, but at the expense of a doubly important stage of sleep called SWS (Slow Wave Sleep).^3 SWS only occurs in the first 3-4 hours of your sleep and so if you destroy it with high doses of melatonin (or galantamine or anything else for that matter) then you are doing yourself a massive disfavour. 

Taking melatonin at sleep onset

This can be applied to almost any other LD drug such as galantamine/choline too. SWS is non-cholinergic and forcing choline into your brain stops SWS

When SWS pressure is high

And so this is why it is important to get the timing right

So lets say you sleep for 3-4 hours, and high REM pressure, take your drugs now! You will be drastically increasing your 'naturally occuring' dreams, rather than screwing around your sleep architecture.

Another option is to take an 8h timed release cap just before sleeping

Now some of you will say you need melatonin to get to sleep (without taking LD into consideration) and in that case just take a 300-500ug (0.3-0.5mg) pill before you go to sleep

Do you know people with sleep apnea? They get almost no SWS and all REM and they wake up feeling like crap every morning without their machines. If you enhance the natural sleep architecture you will not only dream better in the second 4h of your night around dawn

***TLDR:

Do NOT take melatonin first thing before you go to sleep. DO WBTB and take your melatonin in the middle of the night when it is naturally highest and you will benefit the most.

This can be applied to almost any other LD drug such as galantamine/choline too.***

EDIT: added a few linked citations.

citation 1

If you look at any graph of melatonin biorhythm, you will see a natural rise in serum melatonin that starts with Dim Light Melatonin Onset and increases over the night up until a time between 4am and 6am when light and serum cortisol increases.

[It appears that higher doses (5mg+) of melatonin can increase REM sleep

citation3

[Quantitative analysis of the EEG using fast Fourier transform revealed that 5 mg of melatonin given shortly before the daytime sleep episode results in a  suppression of slow EEG components and an increase in the frequency range of sleep spindles (Fig. 3)... the effects  on slow waves are of a  magnitude comparable to the circadian modulation and opposite to the effects of sleep deprivation.](http://jbr.sagepub.com/content/12/6/627.full.pdf+html)

But you didn't experience it.

The way the brain deals with time is so awesome, you know the day ended. You also know it got dark, the person went to bed, and is now sleeping. Did you see any of this? No. Then how do you know? Well, our brains are pretty sweet/horrible in that they're really good at trying to infer things - like why our mom is using that tone we know when she finds out about something bad we did or what happened beyond those 4 seconds of time lapse sun.

We did only see those 4 seconds, and your brain will go ""Ah! 'Twas morning, 'tis now night - I have experienced a day!"" when in reality you experienced perhaps 5 seconds. The kicker here is there is no way to differentiate. Your brain fills it in so well that in a dream, you can never know if you ACTUALLY experienced time passing or it was simulated. 

Ever notice how those grand sweeping epics of dreams are so damn long, think to a school or work day. You are aware you were at work the entire day, but probably only have vivid memories of conversations or concentration-heavy activities. Your brain tosses out the unimportant stuff and fills it with fluff that solely serves to say ""Yes, you were working. It wasn't important."" Some schizophrenic patients struggle with this as their brain begins to fill gaps that aren't there; they might insist they ran out to the grocery store when they've just been sitting on the couch for half an hour. Perceptually, they can't tell.

Another more practical indicator that it's perceptual and not experiential is the lack of trauma. If you *actually* spend 600 years in a dream, manufacture an odd memory here and there.

**TL;DR: 600 year dreams are not experienced

1365729389.0,1c6d0a,A collection of random tips/tricks/suggestions I've learned during my 7+ years of lucid dreaming,kaeraz,549,107,115,"Hello. I've been lucid dreaming off and on since 2006. It started as a mild hobby after I watched the movie [Waking Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/). The more I focused on it

My lucid dreaming routine has slowed down as of late, I tried a number of things to help me become lucid, extend my lucidity, enhance the realism of my dreams, as well as explore the very depths of my inner mind. 

Below is a list in no particular order. 

* To more easily transition from waking to dreaming (WILD)

* Wear socks, the last thing you want to think about is the frostbite forming on your toesies. 

* TALK about dreaming or lucid dreaming with a friend. Everyone can recall a good dream, but I've had great success having detailed conversations *in person* with other people about dreaming. 

* Learn to meditate. So many people are gung-ho about lucid dreaming only to give up after a week, *patience*. Meditation is a great way to learn how to focus your mind on a single thought and idea. People juggle a million things in their brains all day and to filter out everything that doesn't matter and focus on a single point is damn near impossible for some. Meditation is especially necessary for effective WILDing. 

* Bring on the B Vitamins. Particularly 6 &amp; 12. Both stimulate your brain and aid in the production of dopamine. Try falling asleep as you normally would and waking up about 6 hours later. Take a B6/B12 supplement with a glass of apple juice (helps improve memory)

* Always ask your dream character for his/her name. In addition to that, crazy, disgusting, weird things my brain comes up with - seemingly outside of my own control. 

* Ask your dream characters to always remind you you're dreaming next time they see you. Take this one with a grain of salt. It's worked for me twice

* Smoke pot (need not apply to those who don't smoke pot). I'm not advocating this right before bed. Since marijuana affects short-term memory, too!) 

* Seriously read *every word* of [Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming](http://users.telenet.be/sterf/texts/other/exploring_the_world_of_lucid_dreaming.pdf) by Stephen LaBerge. Lucid dreamers recommend him all the time for a reason: guy knows his shit and has scientific data to back it up. 

* Reverse Blinking. This is a method I read on the DreamViews forum years ago. When you go to sleep, object, etc). Quickly close your eyes again and repeat the process. Could be placebo, but on nights when I'm wired and can't relax, this makes my eyes start drooping immediately. You're ready for dreamland in no time. 

* Record your dreams in present tense. Keeping a dream journal is so similar to keeping a regular journal or diary. You often record your thoughts and your day in a tense that tells you it already happened. I've found that writing in the present tense (""I'm walking down a hall"" rather than ""I walked down a hall"") helped me ""stay in the moment"" of my dream instead of losing all the details as I started to wake up more fully. 

* If you forget a part of your dream

* Incorporate your SO if he/she is willing. This is especially useful if you're going to bed at a decent hour (which you should be) and your SO is more of a night owl. Have them be your alarm clock every 90 minutes until they fall asleep. There's something endearing about your SO standing over you with your dream book and smile saying

* To add to the above

* There's never a bad time to question your reality. 

* Experiment with physics while lucid. It's just cool as hell. 

* When you're passed the have-sex-as-soon-as-you're-lucid phase

* Learn something only in your dreams. Get really good at it and see how it compares when you try it in real life. I did this with piano with...mixed results. 

* Never ask or will for something directly. When you finally start LDing, find a clever way of asking for it. I wanted a gun to appear in my hands, but it wouldn't. So instead, I looked in a mirror and imagined a gun in the reflection sitting on a table behind me. I wanted to fly an airplane, but couldn't find one. So I knocked on someone's door and asked a dream character to show me where it was (her backyard, duh). Speaking of...

* Always ask for and accept dream character's help. They're essentially your subconscious trying to reconcile your normal incredulity at doing the impossible. Asking a dream character for flying lessons is much easier for your brain to accept than just taking off like Superman.

* Familiarize yourself with sensory deprivation. Whether it's using an eye masks, denying your senses for a bit will help you get comfortable with sleep paralysis, auditory/visual hallucinations, and other things you often experience during WILD. The more you understand this process, the less scary/weird it'll be when you're trying to get into a dream. Plus, denying one sense can increase the intensity of others, which can further enhance your lucidity. 

* Get used to often being tricked in your dreams. There have been times where I've done 3 different reality checks and have still somehow convinced myself that I'm awake and the millions of egg shells dancing on frozen Lake Michigan is perfectly normal. Look up and practice all sorts of reality checks as often as possible

* Tactile sensations. They are you best friend when it comes to getting into a dream (WILD) and keeping your lucidity as well as the intensity of the dream. One of best methods I've found for ""solidifying"" a dream is to sit down somewhere and feel the ground, pretend you just took MDMA and go from there.

Day 1 - The Wraps Of Lucid Dreaming
---------------------------------------------------

**What Is Lucid Dreaming?**

Possible the simplest question of all, doing your thing every day. Now what happens when we stick DREAMING in front of the word? Well then we get the exciting, wraveling, and mysterious world of your brain at the palm of your hand. Lucid Dreaming is the event in which your conscious, the person you HEAR when you reason with yourself, is awake and wondering ""Why in gods name is that squirrel purple"" or in better and more practical words, that you're dreaming. Your dream is a projected world of everything your subconscious creates in order to do multiple things at the same time. Most of us aren't aware of it but every dream has a symbol, what happens then? I'm sure everyone's heard of this part. You get to screw around in your dreams making skyscrapers come out your face or fly through the solar system

**How Lucid Dreaming Works**

Lucid dreaming works in a deceptively simple way. Basically, but let me explain what happens when you become lucid. You're going to see something wrong, you're going to put 2 and 2 together and realize ""This isn't reality."" Your dream will begin to collapse. Everything will fade before your eyes and sounds from the real world will become a lot clearer than their occasional leaks. Now we need to prevent that. We do this by doing one of numerous things. I like to call these ""Counter Measures"" so bare with me if I refer to them as this. Below you'll have a list of things you can do :

* Hand Rubbing: You just realized you're dreaming. Now you start panicking. Collect yourself and do the simplest of all counter measures, and that's exactly what we want when you realize you're dreaming. You'll calm down and gain control.

* The Rinse Cycle: Or

* Staring At Your Hands: Hand rubbing isn't really working for you, you want to calm yourself down by keeping your brain from overwhelming yourself.

* Grab Something!: You see a bottle of coke you like? Grab it! That girl in your dream have nice breasts? GRAB THEM! Grabbing things in your dream gives you a feel of what's going on and most of the time calms you down as you become more familiar with what's happening around you. It's like when you go to a party and you know everyone, it's your head.

* SCREAM!: Fuck everything around you, but if I do you can feel free to
tell me.

Two notes to say. The first is I've ordered each method from most effective to least. Find one that makes you comfortable and use it! Secondly, Cool, and Collective.

At this point


Me: ""Hey

*Dream friend then turns to walk away from me. I follow a few steps and reach out to grab his arm and turn him back around. My tone is now a bit frustrated*

Me: ""This IS a dream! And that means you HAVE to be part of my subconscious!""



Right as I finished my sentence my dream friend whipped back around with a horrible expression. His eyes were bigger than before and seemed to be open as wide as possible. His mouth was first hanging open and then pulled back into a grimace

At this point I was overwhelmed with a feeling that I was in the presence of something all together horrible. I was no longer standing (and therefore couldn't run)

The dream creature didn't say anything else to me

Now, I'm in full-on terrified panic mode. But I don't know how to get out. For some reason I just started shaking my head back and forth (as if shaking your head 'no') as quickly as I could. I could slowly feel myself getting sucked out of the dream so I shook my head harder and harder until I finally woke up to myself actually shaking my head in real life and drenched in sweat.

I thanked him

There was a classroom
There was a very terse, at the front of the class. 

She explained that once the water filled the room, you must open your eyes, inhale, and start a conversation with the person next to you.

Mind you in reality

The water filled the room, and began talking with others, entirely submerged. 

There was another in the class who could not handle it, he was kicked out, [teleporting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9sgC5Ft6zA&amp;feature=related) him Asgard style out of the room.

Things then cut to a different room. This one was a dark computer lab type room. Each of us was instructed to create a device, others calculators, some cell phones, others had typewriters, while I had an old rotary phone. 

We were then told to input a string of numbers
We were to repeat this
I could not see how dialing would change the numbers on the face, looked down at the phone, and all numbers on it were 9.

Other people had trouble


At this point I could feel the dream fading, or overwritten with another dream. I decided at this point to ""punch out"" of the dream, which felt like riding an ejection seat through a blur of white and gray, until I felt myself wake up.

It's somewhat similar to Inception movie, you just have to write down a **dream scene** on a blank paper. Imagine a **simple** dream scene and write it down on a blank paper. I recommend using a colorful glitter pen, instead of regular blue/black pens.

Here's an example how a dream scene looks like:

&gt; I'm in a square room, your friend, cousin, brother etc) he is wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans. He is asking me how to perform a reality check, so I perform three reality checks (which work as you were actually in a dream) and tell Jacob why reality checks are important for lucid dreaming.

For best results, fold the paper and keep it in your pocket (this will help your subconscious understand the importance of dream scene and the paper). Now, whenever you perform a reality check, think about the dream scene, the room, Jacob, and why reality checks are important for lucid dreaming.

**Part 3**: Visualizing The Dream Scene

When it's time for you to go to bed, listen to some relaxation music, and let go all the physical tension. Once relaxed enough, **visualize** the dream scene, the room, the walls, the roof, Jacob, suddenly a pony appears in the room and we both ride it) No

**Part 4**: In The Dream

The visualization will continue in your subconscious even after you've fallen asleep, with white walls, grey roof and a door. The *only* difference will be: when you will perform a reality check in the room, your awareness will shift to your conscious, and hence, LUCID!

**Part 5**: Stabilization

The method is my favorite for a reason, you'll most likely get a blackout the second you get lucid because of the excitement. However, stabilization is always required, you can check out my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) for some tips on dream stabilization. 

Once you're lucid and the dream is stable, open the door and you're free to go!

**Note 2:** If you didn't fall asleep while visualizing the dream, this method won't work for you.


**tl;dr / quick notes**

* Maintain a regular dream journal and perform at least 10 reality checks per day.
* Write down a simple dream scene on a blank paper
* When in bed
* You'll most likely have an exact copy of your visualization as a dream; the same night.
* You'll get lucid the moment you perform a reality check.",,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tnzmc/beginners_vild_visually_incubated_lucid_dream/

I eventually ditched the journal and happily reality checked as often as i could. I invented ways to play games with myself

At the age of 15, I would just have to keep a certain mindset before I went to bed and I would nearly instantly become lucid.

Last year, (Thank god I had no lasting brain damage.) During that week, I was lucid. Fully lucid. In fact, I didn't even remember getting into the car wreck, I was just living life. And it was strange, because when I slept, I had no dreams. And at this point i was dreaming fairly often.

I had gone on a year of dreamless nights, simply for the fact that I subconsciously created a world. I was able to control my actions, and things had seemed to go my way. It was an interesting experience. The One thing that bugs me about this though, is that no matter what i lucid dream every night, no exception. I need no reality check, no mind set, or thoughts to try and help me out, and instantly resume control. Possible a lasting side effect.

My boyfriend started reading about lucid dreaming and became interested in learning more. He started doing research and doing different techniques while sleeping like trying to wiggle his fingers, wakes refreshed, but doesn't really remember his dreams. I never thought it was something I would need to worry about him trying though otherwise maybe I would have looked into it a little bit more.

The timeline is as follows:
Saturday night I started feeling him fidgeting more while we slept. I wake at the drop of a pin

Sunday night was more fidgeting and more feeling him get up. I was starting to get slightly annoyed because every time he moved he woke me up and added to my own sleeping problems. On top of it, so I accepted it thinking it was probably better than going into the office with him being tired. We talk on AIM while we are at work so, even though we were apart, he was updating me on how he was feeling. He mentioned that he felt a heightened awareness and seemed able to think about multiple things at once when he normally was only able to concentrate on one thing at a time. I mentioned that he was probably on his second wind from being so tired and that he may crash sometime soon and fall asleep. He also came to visit me at work for lunch. At moments he seemed almost anxious and others he would zone out. I was worried about him driving home and asked him to text me when he got there. I told him to work home until 5 and then relax and veg out and watch tv. He made it home and, when I got home from work, we napped for about an hour before I had to go to class that night. While I was in class, he called me and texted me

Now this is when it starts getting really weird; I got home from class and he pulled me out on the balcony. He then got down on one knee to propose to me. During this proposal he still seemed anxious, and one of them made me upset. This has been eating away at me ever since, but we ended up fighting. I went to bed angry.

I'm not sure if he slept at all that night. I fell asleep at midnight and for once slept through the night until 5:30 am. At 5:30, and then proceeded to stand in the doorway. He then paced around the bed like he wanted to get back in but didn't know if he should. Finally I gave up and got out of bed too. He told me he needed to show me something on his ipad, and I grabbed it. I saw it was his ""dream journal"" and things about lucid dreaming on reddit. I demanded ""Is this what you wanted to show me?"" and he didn't answer. 

I went into the shower to get ready for work. He then opened the bathroom door and the shower curtain and stood there staring at me with his ipad in his hands. I asked him what he was doing. He said nothing then tried to get in the shower with the ipad. I stopped him and said he couldn't bring that in the shower. He tried a second time and it was then that it hit me that he wasn't ok. 

I got him out of the shower and wrapped in a towel. He started asking about an ex-girlfriend, that's me. I'm Jess."" He then said ""I..."" and I said ""I what?"". He got confused then said ""I love you."". He kept saying one word like ""I"" or ""One"" and then not being able to finish the sentence. This went on for a bit. 

I had already called his parents by this time because I knew we needed to take him to the hospital. When they showed up he was still not making sense and wanted to go find Kim. We got him into the car with a little bit of hesitation on his part and to the hospital.

At the hospital he was the worst I had ever seen. He was anxious and scared of any sound. His eyes would get huge and he looked like a deer in headlights. He couldn't form a coherent thought and could barely talk. He would hyperventilate and whip his head around frequently to try and find any little sound. He acted over-stimulated and paranoid. It got so bad that that night he started fighting us when we tried to get him to walk anywhere, and stood on a chair and almost fell off the back. I had never seen him this way, nothing even remotely close to this, and I was scared. At this moment, he has been involuntarily admitted into an acute care unit for at least 72 hours.

I'm sorry for writing a novel and I hope someone will take the time to read this. I just need to know if anyone has any information that may be pertinent to this or any sort of similar experience or reaction to lucid dreaming. 

**Edit:** I guess I should have mentioned this because people keep asking if he had taken medications. The answer is no

I knew it was a dream, I had control over what I did in the dream, the surroundings I couldnt change, and the setting was completely the product of my subconscious)

I was also able to get up a few times during the night for toiletbreaks/smokes etc

The dream lasted pretty much the entire time I was asleep, enough about the background, here is the setting (I may post what I did in this dream world if you are interested)

In the future, lead to gold, sand to food, salt water to bricks etc. Of course, this made money irrelevant, physical possessions became less important, and the world turned to the sciences.

Sometime after that, though physical trauma could still kill the unwary. But even this was overcome with the invention of a little one-use device that took an imprint of a person, the moment before fatal harm was done.

The device, with all memories intact, to a matter conversion of their choice, effectively, an extra life. The only problem was, this device needed to bend time, to take the imprint before the person died

Unfortunately that meant that no normal matter conversion machine could create the extra life device. But the factory produced enough that the devices were plentiful, hunger, global warming, and even death abolished, all human hardship seemed at an end. Eventually people turned to artificial means of giving themselves that sense of achievement we all crave. They started creating hardships and obstacles to challenge themselves and others. The gaming nation was born.

Over the passage of time, and history, science and all social restrictions were lost to the passage of time. But with unlimited resources, population swelled at an alarming rate, eventually the entire globe was tamed and filled with people. And demand for the extra life devices exceeded the supply the ancient factory could provide.

Players could only have a few extra lives a month… And players became increasingly unhappy as the problem became worse and worse. Eventually a group banded together to take control of the extra life facility. And with control of the extra lives, and began policing the extra lives. Death squads roamed the world, killing anyone repeatedly until they only had one life left. But the games went on. The deadly obstacles were still there. As the entire surface of the earth was covered with these obstacles, and buildings were made out of a near impervious material, resources, once so plentiful, became scarce.

People began having to play for real, leaving wide swaths of uninhabited land surrounding the most deadly of games. Places only the most elite would dare tread. Though society and technological advancement had ceased, evolution had not. As countless generations passed, human biology reacted the only way it could to give humans a stronger chance at survival. Humans with supernatural abilities began to be born. In the dream I was one of the first to discover these powers, and the dream was all about my experiences in that world.

Fish oil? You may or may not have heard of fish oil (most likely you have) but it greatly increases dream recall so take one before bed and when you wake up in the morning you will remember 90% of your dream.

Tip 3: Edibles? Yes

Not fapping until you have a lucid dream will make your brain realize that if you have a lucid dream you get rewarded therefore increasing your chances of lucid dreaming.

I've been left deep in thought about it all day long.,nujurzy87,369,57,143,"I couldn't help but think about this after I woke up (for the second time this morning). I had a lucid dream the second time around when I went back into the same exact dream. I was in the dream and I knew it was all too familiar, so I started to look around..

I looked all around, but this was the first time I went in there with the approach of using the scientific method. I was just too curious, I needed to understand. It all felt too real. I knew that it was a dream, but, I had developed the hypothesis and had no choice but to develop the hypothesis that there was more to it than what we can currently understand. No way around it. And let me tell you, this is when I highly analyzed and closely, very closely examined every detail I could in this dream. Gather evidence, explore and explore and explore

I remember looking up at the sky, the sun was reflecting off the buildings and clouds, and it was all just too vivid. Passed the clouds I saw the open night sky. It was almost as if there was such a light atmosphere that I saw straight up into the night sky even though it was day time. I saw teal and purple looking stars, stars I had never seen. I was standing there and acknowledging this in the dream and was just amazed. I had never seen this stuff before, what is it all? It was a profound and an enlightening experience.

I then looked at the clouds again and thought 'How is it that they are moving? I didn't consciously create this. I'm looking at it for the first time, and remember looking at that in the dream and wondering about it. The clouds slowly all moving in one direction, towards my left, like the wind was slowly carrying it. How is it moving, and I'm not telling it to move. I'm not in control, but they're moving.. How is this possible? How am I doing this? How is it all so highly detailed and I didn't even consciously create it? 'There's just no way I could've created it, just no way'

I wanted more, some things I thought 'who would buy that?' All of this with the knowledge that I was in the dream. I remember even picking up an odd looking item and looking at it in detail and thinking 'I created this??' And then looked at people interested in things, putting things to the side, buying things.. 'They're buying this stuff I created? Why are some interested in certain things and others are putting things down? It's like they have a mind of their own?' Meanwhile I was still holding the item and I even remember how it felt, and rubbing my hand on it with great confusion as to how it could be fake.. I just couldn't convince myself I had created all of this, but wanting to explore it more, wanted to understand it more. I was just amazed looking at everything, even though I know I again

We started walking and talking in this very bizarre looking city and I saw people looking at her in a negative way for the way she dressed, I had to tell her 'Don't worry about them. Be yourself. If they don't understand then it's their loss.' After a conversation with her, the entire time dying to know where I was.. Just unable to convince myself in this dream that I had created all of this, especially without my own knowledge of creating all of this to add.. I just had to ask, and felt almost scared to ask because it just seemed too real.. I asked with such curiousity, like a child asking 'Is there a God? Why are we here??', I asked her 'Where am I?' She looked at me and it was as if her hurt feelings and everything she was concerned about slipped out of her mind and she just looked at me and smiled. And what she said scared me. It really scared me. She said 'You know... But.. You don't know... You're not supposed to be here.'

That's when I of course felt very unwelcome.. Very unwelcome in my own head (crazy right?) I looked at her but just felt so lost and confused I couldn't even say anything. There were no words.. That's when I looked up again at the sky, but just.. I was almost angry and frustrated too that I just couldn't see how I had created all of this. I was looking right at it all, just.. no way I created it. That's all I was concerned with.. I just couldn't see how I created this. And created it without my knowledge of doing so. No way I asked her for her to answer that and it was just really myself that answered that question. I couldn't even consciously come up with that answer by myself in this dream. I had to ask her and that is what she told me and it just scared me. Was it just my mind that told me 'You know but you don't know.' How scary is that? My mind telling itself 'you know but you don't know.' Again, my own mind telling itself 'You know but you don't know'.. And my mind is right, I don't know..

The more carefully I examined it and broke it all down as I was looking at it, and almost felt like I fell in love with her right at that moment. I even thought, how did my brain just come up with the name 'Melanie' out of all names in the world so quickly and I didn't even ask for her name. But it was just like everything made sense somehow though I still couldn't come to terms, and she was the one who made sense for me. I felt connected to her. What a beautiful and kind girl she was. But after she told me that she said 'I have to go, we can't talk, I hope you understand. I like you though. Remember me.' She walked off and was lost in the crowd. I looked around and felt so lost and scared, like a child who had just lost his parent in the city. No way to help myself. No answers

That's when a kid walking with his parents walked passed me, and she grabbed him by his arm and walked off saying 'be quiet don't look at him.' I looked at her baffled.. I felt like Truman in the Truman Show when he started to uncover that something was going on, couldn't quite put his finger on it though, but knew something was happening. And even like that girl he met in the library and told him 'we're not supposed to talk', the same way this girl 'Melanie' told me. However, unlike Truman, I wanted to stay here and I was so hungry to really understand what this was. I was destined. I realized in this dream that brain neurology.. just can't explain this. Not yet at least. I told myself in this dream 'we are just too stupid to understand. I am too stupid to understand.' And it frustrated me.

I don't know.. I still just.. don't know.. But never felt more enlightened.. You have to be there, analyze, gather data, explore, research, hypothesize, seek all evidence, wonder

There may be nothing at all behind any of this.. But at the same time.. There's just.. more to it all.. Almost a paradox. There may be nothing at all behind this, but it applied to everything. Not just the dream, but reality.. There just may be nothing at all behind this place but at the same time.. there's more to it all. And we don't understand. Our minds are trying to tell us something. That we just don't understand. We are the universe, a way for the cosmos to know itself, and it's like the universe is telling us, or itself, that it.. we.. just don't understand. I don't know... I've never felt this confused, never felt this enlightened before. Maybe one day. Like 'Melanie' told me

1334992736.0,sl0xv,For people who want to learn to lucid dream: beginner's tips,mynameistrollirl,373,60,88,"Hey guys!

I just discovered this subreddit, that will get you started. Some people call it the WBTB (wake back to bed) method. This method has a very high success rate.

Some tips that will improve chances of lucidity with this attempt:

-Try to have a regular sleep schedule for a few days beforehand.

-Abstain from cannabis for at least a week before the attempt. THC in your system interrupts REM function

-Eat choline-rich foods: eggs, from which your body can synthesize serotonin and melatonin. Spinach is a good source of tryptophan, and milk.

If you're vegan... Shiitake mushrooms

When you're ready:

- **Set your alarm so that you wake up about 5 hours after falling asleep.** (Shitty

- **When you wake up, get your brain going a little bit. The purpose of this waking-up-way-too-early business is to get your brain chemistry (acetylcholine/serotonin/melatonin levels) optimized for lucid dreaming. Think of it as an opposite nap. You're about to go back to sleep.

- **When it's time to go back to sleep, starting at the feet and moving up. If you notice it, don't be afraid, it's a natural mechanism for preventing your body from reacting to the input it will be receiving from you while you're in a dream (sleepwalking has to do with a disorder of this mechanism).

When you feel yourself about to drift off, and you will be having what's called an OOBE, out-of-body experience. A good way to know when to do this is when you feel that paralyzation come into effect, mentioned in the last step. If you manage to pull it off, you might find yourself in a weird, dark, empty place. Just relax and allow the dreamscape to manifest.

If you can't retain awareness through the threshold between awake and asleep, with a much higher chance of becoming lucid. If you're not sure you're dreaming or not, there are a few dream checks you can do: push your finger into your hand (it will slowly go through), or plug your nose and try to breathe through it (you'll feel like you're breathing). There are more, but IMO these two are the best. If you practice doing these when you wake up, you 'll end up catching yourself in those false awakenings, when you dream that you wake up in your bed in your room, although it's only worked for me once

Every time when I have followed these guidelines

When you get it to work, but you're in a delicate state. On one or two occasions, the excitement has been enough to wake me up. If you feel yourself slipping out of it, look down at your hands. This can help to stabilize your dream.

So, passively visualize it taking place.

A good thing to try is flying. In the case that you've caught a false awakening, no big deal. You don't need to forcefully imagination-push yourself out the window. The more you focus on the conscious element of the dream, the harder it is for your unconscious to make the dream happen.

Typically, but don't focus on your lucidity too hard. Again, looking at your hands can stabilize it if you feel yourself waking up.

The best thing to do is just experiment. Everyone is different. And keep a journal!

**EDIT:** I'd like to point out that the tips outlined before the bolded steps *aren't entirely necessary, and chance of becoming lucid.

Ceasing cannabis use is probably the most important. I do know people who regularly use cannabis and still have dreams, when I was using it. I think this is the case for most people. However, in either case, ceasing its use will certainly lead to much more vivid dreams, and highly improved dream recall. Think of it as a positive withdrawal effect.

As far as a regular sleep schedule, and how far into the dream it is achieved, is not consistent for me. Exercise and sunlight exposure will help with regulating your circadian rhythm, leading to more consistent neurotransmitter levels, and a better sleep schedule.

Choline and tryptophan are precursors to acetylcholine, particularly the awareness part, although I haven't looked into them as much.

There's also an enzyme that facilitates the production of acetylcholine that you can take supplements of,,False,,t5_2r0f4,True,,True

At 8AM I was woken by the noise of my roommate getting ready for the day.  After he left

I wake up in my dorm bed.  Notice I have a larger-than-average boner.    Out of mild curiosity, they're blurry.  I spring out of bed, all thoughts of sex cast aside.

At this point I am wearing nothing.  I consider walking out the door in my birthday suit.  I throw on some clothes anyway, dream logic.

I walk out of my room.  Instead of my dorm

*Note*: This is **not** a WILD tutorial

**1: WILD + WBTB = WIN**

Most of beginners try to induce a lucid dream using WILD method when going to bed, which occurs after 45-180 minutes of sleep. So trying to induce a lucid dream using WILD when going to sleep like is waiting for a bus at the bus stop an hour before the bus arrives. Chances are you'll fall asleep at the bus stop.
The proper way of performing WILD is:

* Set your alarm clock to wake you up after approximately 5 hours of sleep.
* Get up
* After 45-60 minutes

**2: Relaxation**

Relaxation is very important in WILD. If you're not properly relaxed

* Do stretch exercises during day time.
* (when in bed) Imagine yourself floating in zero gravity vacuum.
* Imagine yourself moving at the speed of light.
* **Focus** on the part of the body your want to relax
* Use of relaxation music for stimulating your muscles and brain. Classical, violin and cello recommended.

**3: The Hypnagogia**

After a few minutes of relaxation, and feel sensations all over you body. It's completely normal, if you **panic**, chances are you'll wake your physical body and you'll need to start over.

&gt; I don't see any hypnagogic imagery

There are three possible reasons for not seeing hypnagogic imagery:
**A**: Your brain is still not in the REM or pre-REM (NREM 3-2) phase. That means you ignored my first tip.
**B**: Your body is still awake
**C**: You're too alert (or excited) to induce the REM phase and/or deceive your brain to make your body fall asleep.

**4: Natural Reflexes**

**Natural** spasms, you'll most probably ruin your attempt at WILD.
The most challenging reflex for me was the ""saliva swallowing reflex"". Hundreds of times I was about to enter the final REM
The key is not to **fight** the reflex

**5: Stay Awake**

If you fall asleep every time performing WILD

* Keep your forearm raised perpendicular to the bed
* Change your default sleeping position.
* Try sleeping on a couch

**6: Entering The Dream**

If you performed all the steps correctly and maintained your awareness to the REM phase, when the imagery gets more stable and clear, imagine yourself (from a first person view) in there, and .. you're there!

**7: Sleep Paralysis**

If you get caught in a sleep paralysis before/during/after performing WILD, a number of muscles can be moved). If you try to move you body, and break the sleep paralysis, you would unintentionally activate the part of your brain responsible for hallucinations. It could be anything, from gorgeous ponies eating your bed sheet, to your brain trolling you hard by making a 3D thriller right there in your bedroom. If you simply concentrate on your breathing, instead of thinking hard about all the horror movies you've seen in past

The key is to stay calm

**8: Stabilization**

Wouldn't it be frustrating if your lucidity lasted only a minute or two

**9: Ending A Dream**

It is highly recommended to wake up after 30-40 minutes of dreaming. However if you continue
After waking up

If WILD didn't work for you, **VILD**, is one of them. Check out my previous post on VILD [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tnzmc/beginners_vild_visually_incubated_lucid_dream).

I have been interested in this practice for a long time

I would say that I enter some form or some degree of lucidity on almost a nightly basis

One way I happened to do this is observing a common physiological sign of falling asleep that I notice almost every night (sometimes day) before I actually fall asleep.  I hadn't heard of the WILD or MILD stuff but this may be something you guys could use too.

I noticed it a long time ago and looked it up and the answer I remember finding said that it was due to basically your brain checking to make sure that the muscles hadn't died or disapeared after they start shutting down for sleep.

With me it is almost always a leg muscle or arm muscle.  What happens is that it will twitch or spasm a little bit withing minutes to seconds before I actually fall asleep.  If I notice it and wake my mind up a little bit then I almost always have a lucid dream later on

This phenomenon is called a Hypnic Jerk.

Here is the wiki for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk

1342255081.0,wjks8,META - stop ruining LD for people.,rumblestiltsken,357,70,93,"I doubt this will make a difference

I often see ""common wisdom"" without any evidence being spread as truth. The problem with this happening is that lucid dreaming is self-fulfilling

The 2 major problems:
------------
1) Sleep paralysis being scary. This is probably the biggest one

SP is not scary for the vast majority of people who expect it. If you don't know what it is or what to expect, and it sucks, but there is no demon crud going on.

The number of times I have seen people here say ""I can't lucid, not the cause. 
The problem is people who should know better continuing to propagate myths about sleep paralysis.

2) I just got into a bit of an argument in another thread about WILD from first sleep

This is wrong. I WILD when I go to bed. I also WILD with WBTB. I will go as far as saying that *for me* it seems easier from WBTB

My point here is the 'old-timey wisdom' of how REM cycles work, and suspect we do not drop straight into REM with WILD, despite experiencing it that way, because sleep doesn't work like that.

My point though is I DON'T KNOW. Telling people what they cannot do when you have no evidence is wrong. It is so accepted by some that they will argue about it despite given contrary evidence (""I can WILD at night"" followed by ""No you can't

---------
These are my bugbears. This place is great compared to most LD communities because it is 'science-based' and discourages astral projection talk and such. I think this minor lack of self-awareness is a flaw in the community right now.

I knew it was him because I was terrified, he said that if I wanted to see his face I had to get the mask off, So we started fighting

The fight was long and hard and I kept asking him questions

Now, and the side that fears failure. I knew that's what he was talking about, I needed to kill that to become him. In my eyes he was free, and finally when I accepted this notion, the mask came off and I looked at myself and it was one of the most disorienting feelings I've ever felt in my entire life. 

It was me, a me that I knew a long time ago, but have sort of tried to mature since then. He then said ""Im coming for you"" and then things got a bit hazy and I woke up. Pretty crazy experience, I'm not sure what to do now. Love to hear people's thoughts.


-edit- I'd like to clarify something, it was an important dream of mine. I'm not trying to say ""Hey I met my subconcious and you can too if you pay me 4 payments of $34.99. I'm not trying to push an agenda, maybe it wasn't my ""subconcious"" but whatever it was, that's how it was personified and it was important to me. I don't see what attacking me and trying to say that I does. How does it effect you if I say ""I met my subconcious"" its not like other people are going to go and hurt themselves in the same pursuit, if the end result is a cathartic event for myself or others, why do you feel like you have to detract from that? Furthermore, why do you have to downvote it because it's something you don't agree with?  ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1j8k7i/i_found_my_subconcious_last_night/

**DILD: Dream Induced Lucid Dream** – In this method, those doing it will need to have a good level of awareness, something that not everyone will be able to do. This sense of awareness is tested because you’ll need to identify the clues that you’re given in the dream.

For example repeating: ""I am dreaming now.""

**WILD: wake induced lucid dreaming** You'll have to enter sleep paralysis which can be achieve by laying completely still. After achieving SP you imagine dream scene and you're lucid.

**DEILD: Dream Exit induced Lucid dreaming** Courtesy of [http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/DEILD-Tutorial](http://www.dreamviews.com/wiki/DEILD-Tutorial) A DEILD is basically a shortened WILD. This technique takes advantage of the fact that as you awaken from a dream the brain remains in dream mode for a few moments, if you are at the end of a REM phase you won't be able to DEILD. If you do this technique right you are almost guaranteed a successful LD.

When beginners perform a reality check in dream, dream start getting blurry rapidly, and they fall into *the void*

Now

* Make a way back to your dream (comparatively easy)
* Enter a new dream or continue the same dream from the void (difficult for beginners)

**Prevention**
Every time you perform a reality check (both; reality and dream), it simply means you're not fully prepared for a lucid dream. What if it actually turns out to be a lucid dream? but since you've already convinced yourself that it just couldn't be lucid dream, all you would get is a blackout. However, everything would still be under your control, for a minute or two.

**Making a way back to your dream**

The dream is fading away, it's not, the REM waves are still at their max. All you have to do is stay **Calm** and grab anything (if there's nothing within you reach, don't run for the streetlight, grab your T-Shirt instead) you *see*! Once you get hold of anything, feel the touch. The more you perceive through your senses, more stable the dream gets.
Tell yourself you stay calm
After a minute a two, and take a pill or two, they actually work!
That's it! The dream it under your control now. Keep commanding your subconscious throughout the dream whenever it gets blurry.

**Entering a new dream or continuing the same dream from the void**

For some reason, or continue previous one.
You're in the void

Making a plan can take only a few minutes. All it needs is consistency.

**The Essentials:**
If you don't have the following down as a MINIMUM

1. Dream journal. It's been discussed like crazy, remember your dreams, playing them out like a movie in your head. Grab your notebook and write down everything you remember.

     Important! Even if you don't remember a single dream, people.

2. Upon going to sleep, I will immediately remember and write down the dream."" Setting up intentions like this prepare your mind for what you want, and you greatly increase your chance.

**The number one reason I get lucid dreams:** Even after doing the above for a while my dream recall was very good, then going back to sleep. I get lucid dreams half the time this way. So do this:

Let's say you need to get up at 7. Set your alarm clock for 5 oclock. When it rings, so if you're still groggy whenever you stay in bed, get out of bed and read a book, do homework/work, or check your email. After half an hour has passed, go back to sleep, again renewing your intentions: ""I will wake up within my dream and accomplish -x-. I will remember the dream upon waking and write it down in my journal."" Then you can go to sleep until 7. Thinking a bit more about lucid dreams while trying to fall asleep can help as well.

Don't worry about losing half an hour of sleep. I'm not sure why, and their technique involves waking up every two hours at night!

**Conclusion:** If you do the above practice every day (which in reality only takes a few minutes of ""special"" effort) then you should have your first lucid dream within a few weeks

You can take your practice further and add a bunch of other techniques, stop at a red light, etc). Ask yourself, ""am I dreaming?"" and consciously look around at your surroundings, being very aware. This will help a lot.

Also, like extending the time of lucidity, not waking up, asking dream characters questions, practicing to fly, learning something, etc.

1371451435.0,1gi2mk,One simple change has given me LDs pretty much at will.,OptimalProblemSolver,294,52,58,"This technique was developed by Dreamcatcher81 on the Dreamviews forum.

Sleep sitting up.




Not the whole night

I used to only LD once every few months

The full method is described here:

http://www.dreamviews.com/beyond-dreaming/118621-sitting-technique-maximize-your-chances-obe-astral-projection.html

It works because your body, but your mind senses (through the vestibular system) that you're in an upright position and so remains aware. The bottom line is that you're asleep, but the higher mental processes that are usually offline at this time such as planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, and self-referential mechanisms are prevented from being shut down. Most of these functions are located in the prefrontal cortex, you don't go into the deep sleep stages

A few notes

-Read the link

-Every single one of the LDs I've had from this method (which is more than 70 now) begins in a replica of my room (the place where my recliner is). As such

-This method produces LDs that are very high level.

-Make sure you support your lower back with a pillow. If you're not comfortable

-Also helps to have a pillow behind your neck so that you're facing forward like you are in waking life. 

-The recliner/deck chair should be roughly at a 120-130 degree angle.

-Put the alarm on the other side of the room to make you get out of bed.

-If you're having a hard time falling asleep after waking up

-If you have trouble falling asleep and don't want to use sleep deprivation

-Whatever you do

-This technique has made lucid dreaming a choice for me. What I mean is that before I struggled and struggled with little to show for it. Now I simply ask myself, I just decide that I'll LD the night after. If I'm not zonked out and don't have any commitments the next day, it's a go. I'm now on the choice side of the LD equation. I simply have them when I want to have them rather than just desperately hoping for them.

Once I cleared them, all across the sky were more moons, standing still in different phases flashing rapidly in and out. As though I were changing the date or the channel so quickly that it could have been all these phases and positions simultaneously.

I was surprised. I couldn't consolidate the feeling of surprise. I couldn't take control of the moon. If I stopped flying. The flashing stopped and the moon and sky returned to a single frame again. If I flew again, the flashing picked back up.

He explained, I found my way- Lucid Dreaming. It was incredible. After the lecture I wanted to practice remembering the names and dates of scholars and their publications (as many of us fellow social scientists probably have to). A bag appeared infront of me.

**GILD** or **""Gravity"" Induced Lucid Dream**, surprising fact is they never had any **LD** before.

So

Brace yourselves

There are basically 6 parts
Here's how it goes:

**1**: **WBTB / Afternoon Nap**

* Set your alarm clock to wake you up after approximately 5 hours of sleep. Get up

* Return to your bed.

* You can skip this step during afternoon naps.


**2**: **Relaxation** 

* During early morning, proceed to the next step.


**3**: **Feel The ""Gravity"" + Entering SP**

* We're so used to Gravity and weight of our body that we don't even notice Gravity pulling us towards the Earth's core all the time. If you're sitting on a chair

* Once you learn how to ""feel"" the Gravity and weight of your body (takes less than 1 minute to learn)

* **All** you have to do is **""feel"" the weight of your body** on the bed and **""attraction"" of Gravity**. You don't need to focus on breathing and/or ""counting"". All you have to do is focus on Gravity. If possible

* Your body will get heavier and heavier, it's completely safe however, because Gravity hasn't actually increased, or has it?

* With the feeling of ""increased Gravity"" comes **SP**

&gt; *Quick Tip*: Never expect or ""wait"" for **SP** and/or its signs


**4**: **Entering The Dream [1] / Shifting Consciousness**

* It is the most important and interesting step. Once in pre-**REM**/**SP**, but since there's no ""physical body"" left to focus on, your consciousness will form a separate ""dream body"" once the **REM** cycle hits. This feeling of transition is unmistakable, you may feel a sudden shift of consciousness from ""real world"" to ""dream world"".

**5**: **Entering The Dream [2]**

* Your brain has entered **REM** and now you're in your ""dream body""

**(a)**: **Sink in bed**. Don't open your eyes yet, don't be surprised or confused. Make sure you perform a **RC** and [stabilize your dream](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) before jumping out of the window.
And

**(b)**: Create a new dream scenario. Imagine your bed is in middle of a valley, feel the cold morning breeze. Now open your eyes and you'll wake up in middle of a valley of flowers! Perform a **RC** (duh!), [stabilize your dream](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/tjlrf/beginners_how_to_stabilize_dreams_the_easiest_way) and you're ready to go!

**(c)**: You can simply open your eyes and get up

**6**: **Ending The Dream**

Ending dream is very easy. All you have to do is close your eyes and imagine your physical body again. You'll be in your bed in no time. Better perform a **RC** to avoid false awakening and you're IRL again!

This is it! Do give it a try

Glad to help! Thanks.

(This is because you never actually question reality when you're awake, unless of course you've trained yourself to do it for LD.)

I got up to close the door, and noticed another door inside our room. I asked my roommate what the door led to, and she said, ""It's our personal bathroom. We just didn't notice it before.""

I started arguing with her, ""Wait, is this a dream?"" And she looked at me with a serious face and said, ""Yes, this is a dream. You're still asleep next to me on the bean bag.""

Then she came and sat next to me,""Wait, but if you're still awake, that means you're really not my roommate."" (I was trying to say that my roommate couldn't be in my dream world when she was awake) I asked her, ""Are you my subconscious?"" And she replied, ""Yes, I am your subconscious.""

I was extremely excited when I found out that there's a subreddit for this subject now, I'm going to write out a good guide for all you fellow travelers in the hopes that not only can we maybe clear out a little of the clutter

**Note** This is, or even the fourth of fifth. This method is only suggested for people who have plenty of experience having lucid dreams to begin with. Period. I'm not telling you not to try, I still try, but I'm telling you not to get your hopes up. Until you actually get good at dreaming via an easier method, like MILDing or DILDing, you probably won't make this a consistent ability. 

Okay, this stands for Wake Induced Lucid Dream. It's called that because it's the ability of staying concious while your body falls asleep, with the end result you conciously entering a dream scape, fun, right? Right. So, let's say you actually are ready to start trying to have some WILD's, what should you be doing? (Aside from already being good at dreaming.) 

Step 1: You need to know your REM cycles. You need to know how long you can sleep and wake up during one of these. These are the periods when you are dreaming. You actually usually only remember the dreams you immediatly wake up from anyway. This is done through trial and error, and using that to fall in a dream, telling yourself that you'll realize it's a dream. That's what most of you people should probably be doing anyways.

EDIT: The only real way to figure out what your REM cycles are is to wake up at random intervals overnight, the closer these things get together. (That's actually one of the reasons WILDing works.)

Step 2: Now it's time to actually try. Wake up during a REM cycle? Check.Okay, and remain absolutely motionless, including your eyes. You are going to have urges to move. Your going to have urges to move some body part due to comfort. Your going to have urges to swallow. Your going to have bad itchces. You need to **ignore them**. This is your brain testing to see if you're actually asleep or not. Moving even the slightest bit completely resets the clock on you. What you may want to do at this point is focus on the hypnogogic imagery you may be seeing.

**this is best down after 4-6 hours of sleep. This method is something you should be trying somewhere in the area of 3 to 6 am. This is the only real way it's going to work. Doing this in the afternoon does not work for most people. Doing this right after waking up will not work. Doing this at any random interval will *not* work.** 

Step 3: Sleep Paralysis! You've made it this far? Great! You're almost there. focus on the hypnogogic imagery, concentraing on making it form. 

I have to go take a test so I can't right out as much detail as I want, this should give all of you a general idea of what you've been doing wrong..

I feel asleep on my couch in my house for a quick nap.

 I was just standing in a house when I realized it was a dream. I can't recall what triggered it but I remember being really excited because it was my first lucid dream. I was walking around the house, I never had sex before. I realized I didn't really know what it would feel like. So I'm on top of him, powering away, trying to figure out how to enjoy it when he starts screaming. For a split second I think its in ecstasy. Then I looked down and his penis is completely mangled and shredded. Blood is everywhere and I realize half of it is missing.

And its inside me.

Then I look up at the guy and he's a little boy. I was horrified

I was immediately horrified when I realized I was in a dream again. Then my couch ""moved"" to the house from before. The boy was still in it crying. I kept telling myself that it was just a dream and that I needed to escape. I ran to the front door and opened it and there was a huge cliff on the other side. I feel vertigo like I'm going to fall in. I turn around and the boy is at the end of the hallway on the ground

I start yelling and had repeated false awakenings (This part is extremely fragmented and just filled with overwhelming terror for me). Every time I would wake up on my couch, I remember sobbing and the feeling desperation that I felt with every false awakening; combined with the hopelessness that I just wasn't waking up.

I whipped out my cell phone and immediately texted my boyfriend: ""Hey

He said ""Alright,"" he insisted, ""We just need something to bore you. and the whole counting calories thing isn't really your thing."" ""What do you mean!? I could totally count calories if I wanted to, I just didn't think I NEEDED to."" My boyfriend got really frustrated in the dream and I started getting really mad at him.

Then two IT guys walked into the room. They started explaining computer parts. The last thought I had was ""This is really boring.""

(**SPOILER ALERT**: If you're interested in this series

“[Anamnesis](http://finite-films.com/films/anamnesis/)” (the short film) takes place entirely in the mind of Adam

The web series will pick up right where the short film left off: in the aftermath of Adam’s death and the chain of events that follow. We get to know Hannah, violent death. We’re introduced to a new cast of characters, including Sean, a lucid dreamer who begins to prefer his dreams to reality; Vera, a fiercely independent tech wizard who is plagued by night terrors; and Noah, a happily married man who has a sneaking suspicion that there’s something wrong with his reality.

Each 12-minute episode of the series will weave together these characters’ respective stories as they begin to realize that they are all connected in a profound way.

I have a lot of trouble falling asleep. It takes me at least an hour if not more to fall asleep

I didn't always lucid dream so much and I was looking for ways on how to do it

I like to fall asleep with the TV(or laptop) on. It helps me go to sleep and also gives me some interesting lucid dreams. When I'm going to sleep, sitcoms seem to work really well. When I do this, my lucid dreams will sometimes be the setting of the TV show and a lot of the time the characters will be in there too(this helps me realize that I've started dreaming). The main thing is just really try to concentrate on what everyone is saying and don't think of anything else until you fall asleep and hopefully your dream will just pick up from there.

next, but low doses of melatonin has always given me extremely vivid dreams. This is what works for me but I don't weigh much at all so you might try some other low dosage.  I also sometimes take 25mg diphenhydramine hcl. It helps me fall asleep faster than melatonin and gives me vivid dreams as well. I never take them at the same time. 

the last tip i have is try these things when you're extremely tired. i lucid dream like crazy when i don't sleep for a whole day. the more exhausted i am

I hope it helps and good luck :3

Yeah, lucid dreaming is so much better than real life. *I can finally see my ex after 10 months, I can finally see my brother because he died a year ago.*


 And thats just two examples, and when you wake up you begin to feel completely powerless. You feel like a puppet playing out your life. You start to look towards going home in the end of the day to sleep, to lucid dream. And that's the problem folks, you rather sleep your life away than to actually live it. Lucid dreaming shouldn't be used to escape the world, lucid dreaming should be used to manipulate the world. You should not be afraid of life, you should not feel powerless because you can't control whats happening. When you lucid dream you are active within right? But compare that to when you're awake, you might be that quiet girl sitting in the corner of the classroom; or you might be that quiet guy that no one wants to hang out with. If you can lucid dream

You should use that to improve you in the real world.

Because the sad thing is

1337706968.0,tzide,A good tip for a better recall of dreams.,achareat,223,23,55,"Until recently I used to write my dreams immediately when I woke up and I have trained a pretty good recall but I have read on the internet to not write your dreams down but instead speak them into a recorder.

I'm always trying what works best for me, now it is 3-4 and they are longer. I can't recall more details of a dream like textures or how people looked, it is a little bit better but not much. 

What I do now is:
1. When I wake up I take my phone open a speak-message.
2. I then tell my dream. (Beware
3. When I'm done I put the phone away and get up. I remember some of my dreams every minute so I make a few more messages like this in the next 30 minutes.
4. Now I just go to school like normally and be normal.
5. When I'm at home I find a quiet room and listen to all my messages carefully. (You'll have to find a quiet room or you still won't be able to understand  yourself.)
6. When I've listened them all I now finally write them down in my dream journal.

This works better because you have to move less and you can write it down better when you are fully awake.

I can't guarantee that it will work for you but I strongly suggest giving it a try to see if it works for you. It takes a little more time though

I was sitting outside on a bench with a friend of mine and saw a girl I used to have a crush on.  She walked over and asked if I would walk with her, but then i just kept trying to take them out.  I started screaming ""I CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT!""  And she freaks out, realizing that this world we're in isn't real, she turns away from me, laughing quietly and says ""I know this isn't real, but I just wanted it to be.""

So I have been trying to go lucid for technically years now. Usually it's a couple weeks of seriously trying at a time, but it worked last night. 

I usually only try WILD on the weekends, peed, read my dream journal, and went back to bed like 30 minutes later. I laid in bed for what felt like forever, trying to relax my body. After awhile I started to feel the familiar feeling of my appendages falling asleep (I've gotten close with WILD before.) Then I heard the auditory hallucinations  that usually follow for me. This is where I usually lose it and wake up. But I stayed calm. Then I made it to a level that I never have. I started seeing flashes of light. Let me take a step back here.

I have been incubating a very specific dream for awhile now (get to that later.) But about a month ago I read the sidebar piece on VILD, which can knock you out of a dream real quick. Mine was a plain gray room with a 'dream guide' to remind me on what to do. Now back to the dream.

So flashes of light. I start imagining my transition room and it's like always where I can see it from any angle I want (kind of like forge builder in halo) but I'm not a part of it.

I am looking for the dream guide and don't see anything, where I know I'm dreaming, but it's like it's an after thought and I'm not fully aware of what that means. I see the guide. I hadn't thought too much about what he'd look like (to keep it as simple as possible per instructions.) He's sitting indian style on the ground wrapped in blankets and a hat. He stands up, shows his face, aaaaand it's John Mayer. 

NOTE: a couple days ago I looked at an article on yahoo about how he is touring again for the first time since a throat surgery. On the cover of his new album

So he stands up

Holy shit I can breathe!

John Mayer then tells me to not freak out

At this point holy shit things are vivid. It's like sombody turned up the saturation on everything. Then I realize john mayer is gone. I walk over to the only door and open it. 

2ND NOTE: I've designed a dream and gone over it a million times for this very instance. It is sexual (surprise!). It involves a specific internet model I was really into growing up. If there are any other 27 yr old males here, but PM me if you want the link.

So I walk through the door into a roomy loft on the second floor of a pretty big house. Lots of windows. Cream carpet, but she has a tanish denim skirt on over the pink panties (not sure why so much tan). Also her hair is platinum blond, no brown streaks like the set. I don't waste any time, and climb in between her legs.

We start kissing. But now that I'm close to her I realize she looks weird. Not like deformed or anything, but Color is fading. I run my fingers through her hair and concentrate on that. Quickly everything is super vivid again. I notice the light coming through the windows is really bright now. I also notice that while I'm still on top of her in between her legs, we are now on a big ottoman, not the couch. She lost her skirt too. I'm afraid that my time is running out so I pull her panties off and sink in (don't remember undoing my pants.) 

I halfway expected it to not feel like much

The next position we did was something I've seen in porn but never tried. Where she is on her stomach and her lower half is off the ottoman (or bed or whatever) and your on your knees in between her legs

So I pump into her in that position. Feels crazy good. Pretty much feels like an orgasm the whole time. At some point I realize were both now completely naked

After a little while longer I decide I wanna cum. So I do. Surprisingly it doesn't feel much better then it already does (which is already amazing.) I just feel my dick get super hard and start shooting off loads of cum inside her. I remember feeling at least a few loads course through me into her

So after playing with her lady bits and the cum leaking out for awhile, more focused on my hands/ her body than my penis. When I finally look back at her face she's smiling and asks me a question nonchalantly, almost oblivious to me pumping into her. But again, either she didn't actually ask a real question, or I can't remember what she said. It's like I remember her mouth moving, but no sound. I pull out and just kind of lay on her, looking her over. 

I remember feeling torn as to whether I should keep the dream going or exit it so I could remember it better. After kissing her a bit more I stuck my fingers in her and had one more feel before closing my eyes. 

I focused on the feeling of my sheets against my skin. I woke up immediately

I grabbed my laptop and typed up a synopsis with as much detail as possible (which a lot of this post consists of.) As soon as I was done with that I went into the bathroom and jerked off. At this point it was about 6am. I ended up not going back to sleep. 

So there you have it, as I found out that I remembered even the very beginning of the dream very clearly. ",,True,,t5_2r0f4,1374692982.0,,

Now it was as if things were moving so fast and I wasn't in control with where I could go or what I could do

I remember seeing this one painting that looked like Adam in the infamous Da Vinci painting. It was amazing the colors and the precision of it. I remember the lady next to me was trying to talk to me but I had to tell her to slow down that I was trying to concentrate. I remember looking at these paintings with the knowledge that this was just a dream, I'm staring right at it, and it's fucking beautiful.'

I remember even seeing one painting in particular that had a green, the flow and the blends, over and transparent to all these straight lines that formed a very abstract design. This one painting I thought about more when I woke up. I remember thinking how my brain created this and where those lines and the colors really came from.

Anyway, and really just staring at these paintings. The longer I looked and the more I was able to study them the more intense it felt. How real it all seemed. It was really too much to handle. And I wondered why I couldn't bring it out of me while awake. The beauty of it all. 

I remember feeling as if this lady too was my subconscious. I learned that people or conscious beings in dreams may represent the subconscious mind and now that I go into lucid dreams, trying to understand how I did this and how to create art pieces like this while awake. I remember hinting that and asking her.

She was on my right side, and it actually felt like something divine was hugging me. Almost like.. well scared to say it, but like God was hugging me. That's the best way I can describe it. She said 'close your eyes'.

I remember thinking in the dream this was my subconscious, but I just knew. But also wondered 'close my eyes? in my dream?' I did and it all went black and all of these images and colors started to appear. I couldn't even control it.

Then she hugged me closer

When she said that I just saw an outline of a paint brush over to the left of my view in what was blackness when I closed me eyes. I got a little confused but felt that there was something behind that answer. But it became so intense, and it was this that woke me up.

***Tips***

* If you're in a lucid dream and you start to feel the dream fading away, you can rub your hands. It's also not a bad idea to do a RC. This will stabilize the dream

* If you want to fly

* To change your environment, because you might wake up(see next tip)

* If you want to wake up from a dream

* Bad things will happen only if you expect them to happen. I've read stories on this subreddit of someones subconsciousness turning into a demon

* If you get overly excited, having sex will wake you up almost immediately. Stick to other things until you get more experience

* Have a dream journal. Most of you already do this

* If you want to get random lucid dreams

* Tell people in your dream to remind you you're dreaming the next time they see you. This helps!

* I often get bored while WILDing, imagine the fun things you'll do if you'll do if you don't cancel the WILD!

* Dream control: When you become more experienced, your dream won't listen to you. A cool trick is to get that remote out of your pocket and use it!

You didn't know you had a dream remote? Yup, just take it out of your pocket and press the main button! You can try the other smaller buttons as well, they have pretty fun effects. With the remote that's in your pocket, you can do anything! All the fun, just waiting for you in your pocket!

---

***Fun stuff to do when you're in a LD***

* Do whatever you wanted to do! You'll usually have things you wanted to do already in your head. Do them!

* Fly. I've explained flying in the tips

* Portals. Might want to play 2 or 3 levels of portal to get the hang of them

* Talk to your subconsciousness!(may not be recommended for beginners) Just find anyone in your dream, if the character tells you your not dreaming, punch him in the face and go somewhere else.

* Posses animals and people!(the remote may come in handy here!)

* Eat. Seriously, use the remote!

* Do dramatically epic things. One time I pointed my finger at the sky and yelled GURREN LAGANN! Gurren Lagann's theme song started playing

* Have a lightsaber battle with someone!

* Ask someone in your dream for a fun thing to do. That's basically asking yourself what you want to do.

* Travel to other planets! You can fly to them

* Ask your subconsciousness to tell you something about yourself that you didn't know.

* Find a TV and enter it.

* Have magical powers(cough remote cough)

* Run really fast! You can even break walls with enough speed!

*  Get out your dream journal(do I still have to tell you how?) and read it. Try reading the page that you'd write when you wake up.

* Create an apocalypse and watch it's effects while flying

* Turn yourself invisible(you should know how by now) and mess with other people in your dream

By the time I got downstairs, and then spent the next few minutes marvelling at the clarity of the dream while stabilizing.  

Suddenly, I had six fingers.  I got out of bed and was disturbed the the darkness of the room.  I tried to turn on the lights, but it didn't work.  I walked to my office and stared out the window, trying to ""pull"" the sun above the horizon.  Although it didn't work as quickly as I intended, the sun eventually rose and the room was bright again.

Then I woke up in bed.  I reality checked again

Then I woke up in bed.  Again.

I reality checked the got out of bed.  I looked out the window and saw that the landscape had been transformed into a scene from my favourite video game.  I opened the window and pushed out the screen when I froze.  What if I was sleep walking?  I logically knew that what I was seeing was a dream, to which I responded, ""I was going to fly"".  

""Are you crazy?  You could have killed yourself!"" He yelled

--and then I woke up in bed.  Again.  I proceeded to do so again and again, I was slammed into a regular dream with absolutely no lucidity.

When I woke up from that dream, pinching nose and breathing in, pushing finger through palm, and looking in the mirror).  It was surreal.  Despite the irritation of multiple false awakenings (and twice I woke up in bed frozen with sleep paralysis), it was one of my longest and clearest lucid dreams to date.

1344109085.0,xoko0,Don't really wanna WILD? Here are 7 Pretty New Lucid Dreaming Induction Techniques! (Includes TL;DRs!),Rexq21,253,65,79,"&lt;Note: Here is the [source](http://best-lucid-dreaming-techniques.com)

**TILD - Thirst Induced Lucid Dreams.**
The motivation starts because you’re going to basically dehydrate yourself before bed. Don’t drink anything for several hours before bed, or salty crackers that make them feel even thirstier.

Don’t do anything to quench your thirst when you fall asleep at first. You’ll want to sleep about five or six hours so you can get out of the delta phase. Then, but just think about how good it would taste to drink the water.



**TL;DR**: Don't drink anything several hours before going to bed and make sure your *really* thirsty! Go to sleep and set an alarm for 4-5 hours after you wake, but know you won't drink it. If you ever find yourself drinking it, do an RC.



**UILD - Urinate Induced Lucid Dreams.**
UILD is a good way to get into the habit of doing reality checks. We all use the restroom at least three or four times throughout the day. Start by doing a reality check every time you use the restroom

Then, when you do this, you’ll actually dream of relieving yourself quite frequently. This way, you can remember to perform a reality check when you use the restroom in your dream.

**TL;DR**: Drink *a lot* of water before going to bed but don't go urinate! Intentioanlly fill up your bladder and, summon a woman and have fun! 

**RILD - Reward Induced Lucid Dreams.**
RILD works by simply rewarding yourself when you remember that you are dreaming so that you can have a lucid dream. Rewarding yourself here is a little like rewarding a little kid or a pet. You need to reward yourself immediately after waking from a lucid dream.

What does your reward need to look like? It depends on what you like! Some people keep a special drink or type of food by the bed and treat themselves to a sip or nibble upon waking from a lucid dream. Others might read a beautiful poem on waking



**TL;DR**: Whenever you lucid dream



**PILD - Punishment Induced Lucid Dreaming.**
Basically, punishments and rewards are all about your intentions. The harder you intend to become lucid, so to speak, the more likely you are to do so.

So, remind yourself that you’ll be punished when you wake up in the morning. It sounds brutal, but your punishment doesn’t have to be severe, simply uncomfortable or annoying.



**TL;DR**: Punish yourself if you don't get to Lucid Dream in the morning



**LILD - Letter Induced Lucid Dreams.**
Basically, or being that you encounter during the day and that might also tend to pop up in your dreams. Not sure what symbols recur in your dreams? Start keeping a dream journal andrecalling as much of your dreams as possible! Since our dreams are made up of mostly things we know and think about during the day, chances are likely that you’ve got some recurring symbols in your dreams like most people do.

**TL;DR**: Pick a letter from the alphabet

**CILD - Clock Induced Lucid Dreams.**

**TL;DR**: (It's very simple) Take a **digital** (NOT ANALOG!!!) watch, then look back at it. If it changes or what you see is absurd, then it's a dream. If every things normal, you're awake.

**TILD (2) - Totem Induced Lucid Dream.**
(This is not the same as Inception)

Essentially, whenever you see or touch this object, do a reality check. Then, in your dreams, you’re likely to pull out that item and use it for a reality check, so you can have a TILD.

Another way to do TILDs is to use the totem itself for reality checking. If it’s something you always wear, the totem will have different or strange writing on it rather than what you know is actually there.

What you do is set an alarm to go off after you've slept for about 5-7 hours. Then set an alarm to go off about 15 minutes after the first one

What this does is the first alarm slightly wakes you up so you can turn it off, not after the previous alarm wakes you up) 

By the time the third alarm goes off you'll be exhausted and feel like you'll pass out as soon as you close your eyes(which you probably will). This would be a great time to try the WILD method. It worked for me almost instantly and gave me my first LD!

I wanted to mimic a lucid dream scenario in real life so I came up with something called the lucid trance.

The first thing you need to do is get yourself into a deep trance by using meditation. Not meditation where you sit

This gives you the same awareness you have inside a lucid dream.

Now to mimic the control part you need to try and manipulate your sensations with your mind. This is actually very easy to do when you're in a deep state of relaxation. Just like you would control things in a lucid dream you can try and make yourself feel like you're spinning around

I've found by having the awareness + manipulation it's very easy to mimic a lucid dream.

Now when you actually dream you should be used to being so aware in that state that you can become lucid very easily.

1344219197.0,xqqvi,How I used lucid dreaming to uncover a suppressed memory,coeddotjpg,235,54,42,"This is a story about a dream I had, went on a cruise


The dream changed to a hotel. It was old, for many years, winning men's hearts like she had won mine. Then breaking them. She had gathered us because she had an infant. She wanted to live an entire life again. I grabbed the child and fled. I ran to the front desk and implored them to call the police but they refused. Dreams being odd like they are, the police appeared and arrested me. They gave the child back to Magdelina and as they hauled me away she held the infant and smiled a wicked smile.


I woke up and began recording the dream in my journal. I realized that I had seen that smile before, had created this wicked dream character. It was still night so I decided I'd go looking for her. I’m no stranger to lucid dreaming so I prepared myself, drank a glass of water, and headed back to sleep.


I was immediately lucid. I was in a house with a family I didn't know. All of the furniture and appliances were pristine and white, they were playing  video game I’m fond of. I realized that I was still lingering on the surface of my mind and I had to delve lower. I tried something I had never done before, I closed my eyes in the dream and told myself to go back years. I reappeared in the same house but everything was different. Some of the furniture had been cleared out and what was left looked used and aging. There was a party going on with people from all years of my life but also many strangers. I searched the crowd but didn’t see Magdelina.


I walked about the party observing the dream characters. One man I recognized but couldn't place. He had a bemused look on his face, but later as I sat on a couch I realized that three other characters had taken yo-yos as well, and these three men were in the hotel with Magdelina in my original dream. I realized that I was on the trail of the memory and so I tracked the men down, all three were meeting in the basement of the house.


The first man was older, snarled and attacked me. I simply flung him against a magazine stand that was in the basement for some reason. The third I grabbed and lifted by the neck. He wore business clothes, dark navy blue khakis and a light blue collared shirt. I didn’t have to say anything, just looking at him began to bring back some memory.
At this point in the dream I receded in age. It was like I found a younger version of myself, from before the divorce. It was summer. The front door was open, a screen door separated me from the front porch. A thunderstorm was brewing outside. I realized that we, the children, were alone in the house. My parents were shopping. They often left us alone, with the teenagers to look after us. I wasn’t afraid. Any adult that came looking for trouble would find it. I’d fight and stab and kick. But why? What made me that way?


I was suddenly in the mall, sloshing water and soap around silverware and plates. Somewhere I knew my brother was hunting down a video game display on the other side of the store, where arrays of televisions were glowing blue. I had wandered near the front door.


“Are you lost little boy?” a beautiful woman asked me. She appeared Spanish, exotic, like she had altered them herself. “Do you want to come with me?” she asked as she clasped me on the wrist. It hurt. I wanted to tell her that I was with my mom and dad but I was four years old and terrified. She was smiling but it was off. There was no kindness in her eyes. Despite the look on her face I knew she meant me wrong and now she was pulling me towards the door. My mother arrived to save me. I don’t remember the altercation but I remember the feeling of relief, the raised voices, my father joining my mother as the woman fled out of the front door. She looked back not at the young four year old me, but at me. I was suddenly in the dream watching everything from a distance. Magdelina smiled furiously and turned, departing back into my memories. I heard a humming sound as the dream decayed around me. It was my electric fan

Note: There were data tables in the project but they didn't quite come out right on Reddit so I took those out.

My hope is that this helps someone out! Enjoy!

		Behavior Modification: Lucid Dreaming 



The target behavior for this project is lucid dreaming. This occurs when the dreamer realizes within the dream that they are asleep and dreaming. At that point of recognition

Lucidity is best achieved when the dreamer is making an effort

**Dot on the hand**: The subject will draw a dot in their palm, then they will look at their palm, and if they see the dot, it lets them know that they are not dreaming. Skeptics say that the subject could simply dream the dot in their palm, which would make them think they were not dreaming. However, the whole purpose of a reality check is to get your brain in the habit of asking itself if it is dreaming or not. Thus, by checking the dot on your hand frequently while actually awake will form this habit. This will improve your chances of your brain asking itself if it is dreaming or not while asleep


**Plug your nose**:  Plug your nose while awake and try to breathe in through your nose. In reality, if you plug your nose and attempt to breathe, you will still be breathing in reality so you will feel yourself breathing in your dream. This should trigger the realization that you are doing something impossible, and that you are dreaming. This also works with trying to breathe underwater in dreams, though it is not suggested jumping in the pool and breathing to test your awakeness….


**Look at/feel your hands:** Not quite sure why this one works, make sure they feel normal. While dreaming, it is not uncommon to dream that you have an abnormal amount of fingers, or that you feel that you have more than the usual ten. 

**Reading text:** Throughout your day, then look back again to make sure it is unchanged. In your dreams, often text will completely change when looked at for a second time.


**Dream Journal**: This is not a reality check, write down every detail of your dream that you can remember. Going back over your dreams helps you pay closer attention to detail the next time you dream. During our dreams, there are so many details that should give it away that it is not real, but we simply skip over them for some reason. The closer you can pay attention to detail in your dreams, the greater chance you have of going lucid.

My goal was to fly once I began to lucid dream.

Stimulus conditions were promoted by recording my dreams on my phone each morning that I woke up after dreaming. I would go back to my dream journal right before going to sleep as well, and then I would attempt to recreate that dream in my head, only checking the journal if I got stuck on a detail. This helped to get my brain back in that dream state and to pay closer attention to detail. Also, the dot on the hand, plugging of the nose, and checking of hands reality checks were implemented every day. I actually drew the dot on the knuckle of my thumb, that way every time I looked at my phone for whatever reason, recognized I was dreaming

**Results:**


Finally went lucid on my 20th night of this experiment!

**The Dream!**

*I was in some neighborhood in South Dallas, and I was all by myself. They were not happy that I was in their neighborhood, and I obviously felt extremely vulnerable and scared for what was about to happen. But then my logical mind kicked in and told myself “I would never put myself into this situation in real life… this isn’t real!”, and then my friend’s Lincoln Navigator appeared right in front of me so I hopped in. That part of the dream I didn’t control, but the next part I did. My goal for my lucid dream was to fly, and so I simply put my mind to it while in the driver seat of that car, and took off in the air.

I’ve gone lucid only once before, training my mind to ask myself whether what was happening was real or not. My first lucid dream happened after a month of reality checking, and this one happened after three weeks, so it certainly takes some time to happen, but that may just be me. Everyone’s mind obviously works differently, but the point is don’t be discouraged if it takes you a while to achieve your first lucid dream.

1. Every half hour stop what you're doing and look around. Ask yourself clearly ""Am I dreaming or awake?"" Try to remember how you arrived there and everything you did at least 2 hours before in order. Eg.: ""Today is Tuesday, before I was at my house, before I was eating breakfast. Therefore, I must be awake. If I was dreaming, I would be conscious right now."" It's important that you take some time into this (at least 10 seconds). Many times I took the wrong conclusion thinking I was awake when I was actually dreaming because I didn't ""care too much."" You must CARE! And the best way to care is to stop what you're doing and look around for at least 10 seconds. You must remember what you did. Don't just try to compare with reality. If you ask yourself every half hour, you will make it a habit. That can take 3 or more months, but it will eventually become a habit. Once that happens, it might actually be funny because you might remember that half hour ago you went to sleep, or whatever).
**tl;dr: Try to remember how did you get there all the time in your daily life.**

2. If you don't want to keep asking yourself every half hour, that has to become a habit first. It can take a few days or months.
**tl;dr: Ask yourself if you're dreaming always after a specific event.**

3. You must be rested to lucid dream. I've never heard of anyone lucid dreaming while tired. So
**tl;dr: Be well rested.**

4.  If you want to be aware, and the KEY is TO STOP. How many times during the day you stop to hear you breathing or your heartbeat? If you do that in a dream, you're likely to realize you're dreaming.
**tl;dr: Don't let the world make you forget about yourself.**

4. Before going to sleep tell your subconscious you want to lucid dream and will remember everything. Leave pencil and paper close to your bed. When you wake up
**tl;dr: Wish to get lucid and always write your dreams.**

5. Depression can prevent you from lucid dreaming, alcohol, stress, guilty, traumas, fear, or anxiety.
**tl;dr: Be zen.**

6. While lucid dreaming, that's more than enough! Wake up before you lose your conscience. Your average time lucid in a dream correlates to the average time you can focus without getting distracted. Keep looking at the wall and count in the clock how much time you can stay staring at a boring wall without spacing out. That's around the time you can lucid dream (it's usually around 10 minutes, but with practice you can do it for several hours).
**tl;dr: Don't stay lucid dreaming for too long. Wake up before you forget.**

And then I went back to sleep, and dreamed again and again... and by the end of it, my pervertedness had gotten to me entirely.",mybiggestfantasy,84, I am not actually this perverted in real life.  I don't judge women on a scale of 1-10, I operated under perverted logic that I would never espouse IRL.

**First dream:** I was sitting in front of my computer, it was unbelievable.  I opened the door and ended up in the hallway, then opened another door to go outside.  People started appearing.  I looked at each one - everyone looked perfectly normal, especially the women - some were slightly pretty, some were not.  

I started grabbing each woman that passed by, another one was ugly, and another one had her boyfriend walking right next to her.  I knew at this point, in my dream-state, that I wanted to have sex with at least one of them.

Finally I found a girl that I deemed ""attractive"" enough, pressed the tip of my shaft into her wetness, and then... all faded to black.  

**Second dream:** I was in the gym with a couple of guys just lounging around and staring at me.  There was this annoying jazzy song playing in the background, and I was able to move.

So I started walking around, but finally I found this blonde one who maybe would rate an 8/10, (no 10's appeared in my dreams), and she got on her knees and began sucking.  Amazingly, it felt like actual oral, and somehow my penis was about 3 inches longer than usual, but not wider.  I tried to make it wider

I'm not an experienced lucid dreamer, I would start seeing very vivid images of random things - a baby stroller on the sidewalk, an old, furnished room, shadows of monsters and forests teeming with life.  But these images flipped by as if in a slideshow - I never could interact with them.

I always knew about this subreddit, a few weeks ago, a pictorial on /r/youshouldknow on luciddreaming sparked my interest and I clicked into it.  I read the pictorial, and then thought nothing more of it.

1356552418.0,15hcay,The real trick to staying in a dream.,pugwalker,216,47,43,"So I am a very frequent lucid dreamer and I have always tried to broaden my understanding of how dreams work by just trying things out myself.  For a really long time I have had a very difficult time staying in dreams and I think other people suffer from the same problem.  So a few weeks ago I tried changing my dream mentality. 

 Instead of trying to change the dream and to do what I wanted to do *cough* sex *cough*, some event would happen that would jump me to the next scene [I would usually cycle through about 3-5 scenes until I woke up].  Normally this would be something like closing my eyes and reopening them in a false awakening to try to trick me into losing my lucidity. Once I started going with the flow I can move around and experience the dream as I please and as long as I don't try too hard to mess with things, then I can stay in the same scenes.

So basically my advice is not to get too wowed by all the stories in this subreddit.  Don't try to immediately fly out of your dream environment to go fuck shit up.  This will usually end in your body making you fall and having you either wake up or give you a false awakening [which is very deceptive because everyone has stories of people who fall to their deaths in dreams and wake right before hitting the ground]. 

I'd like to give one more thing that I've learned as I've become a more experienced dreamer.  About half of the posters on this subreddit are full of shit.  Do not believe everything you read here because people love making up dream stories that people who do not know what lucid dreaming is like will believe.

Previously, an individual must first realize they are in a dream.  It goes on to say that a good way to realize that an individual is in a dream is to point out various oddities in the dream that don't jive with the real world.  Some good examples would be skewed laws of physics (i.e. ability to fly, inability to stop running, etc.) or continuity errors (i.e. people and locations inexplicably changing, change of storyline, etc.)  Using those two fairly simple ideas, I began to analyze my own dream from within.  One thing that struck me as particularly odd was the way every house I visited had the exact same symmetrical layout, talking to one person

So, naturally, I decided to defer from the seemingly pre-determined dream path and explore this dream world my mind had created.  Needless to say I survived the mighty fall from the top of the building, again, by almost ""jumping"" from scene to scene.  Once on the ground of this city, I took a look around.  This city, which I felt I knew, shrouded by the night with the gentle pitter pat of the rain.  Reflections of the lights bounced off the pools of water.  Pristine in appearance, in a large city

This is where I broke dreams.

I started wondering, where was the edge of the map?  So I started running and, unlike real life I felt no fatigue, and eventually hit the end of the road.  There was no road further forward, just tall brick buildings blocking my path.  Yet, this was not the oddest part.  Lining the alleys and sidewalks of this last remaining road was everyone I had ever seen or met.  Motionless, blank faces, they  crowded up and down the road as far as I could see.  Out of curiosity I approached a cluster.  When I got near enough

I'm not one to hang around creepy places so naturally I did what I would normally do.  Push on further.  This being a dream world I knew nothing was real.  I figured the walls shouldn't be real either, or somebody else's, dream, and everything is white except for the lonely body of the character? (good examples are the dream episode of Spongebob or the imagination Episode of Adventure time)  That's what happened.  Nothing but white space, everywhere.  My brain had not created a world for this place, so I guess it makes sense that nothing would be there.  However, I could not enjoy this wonderful broken place

I figure, something familiar and with limitations.  Why it needs to, I don't know, I haven't figured that part out yet.  When I first began to tear away from the dream path, characters would constantly call out for me, begging me to come back.  As if they needed me to stay and do whatever it is they needed me to do.  Similarly, the dream world would try to change around me, and reached the edge of the dream, you remember the part where Leo is explaining that the mind populates the dreams with people it remembers. That's exactly what happened.  My mind had populated the world with everybody I had ever seen, currently involved with my progression.  Similarly they would deactivate when I ran from them because they were no longer needed. 

The part where I broke out of the dream blows my mind the most.  Since my mind had not planned on creating anything outside of it's city, and  I have no explanation for that.  For whatever reason, my mind needed to keep me inside that dream, doing everything it could to keep me inside.  Yet, when I escaped, it continued it's desperate attempt at keeping me inside by creating a whole new dream around me.

I can't explain it, and if anybody had any explanation it would be one of you guys.  It may be outside the realm of science, but I felt this was the best place for it.

**WILD techniques** aim to induce dreams from a waking state. You basically lie still in bed while maintaining your awareness until you fall asleep consciously, but nobody does it the same way. You just have to find your own way of doing it.

I read into a few threads of people that are using reality checks and just wanted to share the one that I use (which always works).

* Pinch your nose and try to inhale.


In the real world its obviously quite impossible. In a dream you will be able to breath through it.

I love it because it takes less than a second

 
In case you struggle with keeping up reality checks I suggest that you buy a watch that has a vibration function. 

Set the watch to vibrate every hour (or every two

It will create a steady pattern of reality checks and the chance of you doing one when you dream increases drastically.

Bonus of having a vibrating watch is that it will also vibrate when you sleep

*(WBTB) wake back to bed. Set an alarm clock, go eat a small healthy snack and drink a glass of cold water, or cold milk. try to stay up for at least 30 minutes, and then go back to bed, don't force yourself to fall asleep, just let your mind drift and keep telling yourself that you will have a lucid dream and be sure to do a reality check! so that you can become lucid.

you try this at least 3 times

I will try to dispel these myths so think of me as the [Dayman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLRUMHSst2Q): master of Karate and friendship for everyone!

So seriously now, bloodsuckers and scary old people that smell of cabbage. You should not be afraid of these things appearing because there is a trick that I will tell you that never fails (it has never failed me since I figured it out).

These things are ALL in your head. They are figments of your imagination and if you know that

Imagine if you saw some scary guy right now next to you. You would freak out because you KNOW you are awake. Right?

But what if you KNEW that you are sleeping? what if you KNEW that you are GOD of this place and any motherfucker that tries to mess up with you will get what they deserve because it's your OWN WORLD and you can do whatever the fuck you want in there. There is no fake ass nightman that is going to scare you man, just tell him ""whatever"" and go bang a hot guy/lady or something.

This subreddit has a morbid fascination with this ""scary"" shit just because most people here have not had a proper LD and they are talking about experiences of being in a very vivid asleep/awake phase but NOT KNOWING they are dreaming.

So my 2 cents of advise so that everybody is clear. If you see some crazy shit, you have waken up but your asshole brain is taking some time to realize it. You will be fine in 5 seconds or so. Try something for me if you find yourself in this predicament. Try to jetisson yourself through the wall that is on the head of your bed. It has worked sometimes with me and it brings you in an LD instantly (I love going through walls anyway).

So please Keep Calm and Carry on. And don't hate on the [nightman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE6GC47NxgI#t=2m39s) dude...

Happy dreaming every one!

**tl;dr You control your mind, therefore,[ you control whether or not they are scary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tiynTPuUUM).**

1368067045.0,1dz6c9,GUARANTEED LUCID with FILD and The Timer Method,BeaconOfBacon,184,32,67,"**Video at bottom in case you don't want to read.**


So lately FILD has taken over this subreddit and has a great success rate. I learned about the timer method a long time ago and it made a lot of sense. I realized this method and FILD would work great together.


This is the timer method


1) Go to bed at your normal time and set your alarm clock for your normal WBTB time.

2) Set an additional alarm 8 minutes after the first, then 12, then 16, then 20. After that you can keep going as long as you want with intervals of 8 minutes.

**Example:** Go to bed at 10, 4:12, 4:28, 4:48, and then maybe 4:56, 5:02, 5:10 [or 8 minutes until I was ready for sleep])

You want to be able to set up the alarms so you don't need to move to shut them off. How this method works is by keeping your body hovering in between states of awake and asleep. You will fall asleep and be woken up by the timer. You just have to relax


The time is set up in those specific intervals because after a few short timers your body will start expecting a beep keeping you even more aware and alert in the dream state. This is a great method to become familiar with the feelings associated with falling asleep


This is where FILD comes in. Simply use FILD at every alarm to give yourself a much better chance to WILD. Experiment each time you wake up in order to find the method right for you. Good luck!

[Video explaining the method if you need clarification


**Edit:** You can use alarms like I said above but that is not how I do it. I use an mp3 of silence and an mp3 of an alarm. I make a playlist of the silences and beeps and play that While I sleep. You should be able to find some time/alarm apps

**Edit:** People are complaining about the title claiming I shouldn't guarantee anything. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT and LUCID DREAMING TAKES TIME! Be sure to try every method multiple times with a couple days in between each time. Always have faith in your methods you're using and be positive. Don't doubt yourself or methods. Like any other skill lucid dreaming takes practice. Happy Lucids!

1360773672.0,18ga90,Three easy tips for any beginner/learner - also advice,VaesLondon,187,39,13,"Step one: Keep a dream journal so over time you develop a natural ability to remember your dreams (you could have had hundreds of lucid dreams; you just won't have remembered any). You could do this in a journal, because it is easy to forget something vague if your brain is concentrating on what you're going to eat for breakfast.

Step two: Set up a reality check. A reality check is literally making sure if you are in reality or the dream world. This must become a habit if you are to easily tell if you're dreaming or not. A really simple one that usually works for me is looking at your hands as if examining them after a manicure. In the dream world, walking through mirrors (don't try this in your actual home to save embarrassment!), attempting to fly etc.

The movie Inception is not a good base for RCs

Step three: Once dream remembrance and RCs (reality checks) have become a natural ability

P.S I posted this a few months ago

*Edit*

Oakleafer made a deeper analysis of this technique in the comments section


""Dream journals require continual commitment and perseverance. After the honeymoon period has worn off very few people stick to keeping their journal regularly updated

Reality Checks require a great deal of mental discipline. Simply going through the motions of an RC then continuing with whatever you are doing is going to be useless. You need to really question your state - really bring your awareness into the present moment. Stop what you're doing
This can be a very hard habit to form and it is easy to become flippant and perform the practice half-heartedly.

**The dream journal.** 

If you have been trying for a while with no lucidity, was like you once. It took me one whole year of attempting to lucid dream to actually have a lucid dream. I say that not to get you down but rather so you can learn from my foolish mistakes and my personal successes. I currently average 3 dreams a night but often more with it peaking at maybe ten. I have lucid dream frequently with the most in one night peaking at seven. It was quite the opposite not too long ago. Far from it. Read on!

Edit- for perspective purposes

I tried everything. Reality checks, vitamin B6, a plethora of other supplements, binaural beats, isochronic tones, sigiling, mantras, saturating myself with lucid dreaming knowledge while awake

I had heard of the importance of journaling before and I had even tried it, and am, a lazy prick. I would often wait until going to bed to record the previous nights dreams. Even when I was not lazy, I just could not seem to remember dreams well enough to make the journal worthwhile.

One day I got fed up with having no success and I decided to do something about it. I got a spiral notebook and a pen and put them near my bed and pledged to put them in use when I awoke. I had the same problems as before. I would remember a dream every couple of weeks. This was getting me pissed of like nuts. 

What I decided to do was make a mantra that I would say and use actual effort, brushing my teeth and anything else. 

The mantra was ""remember your dreams."" Plain and simple. The result of my toil was this. I would awake and after saying the mantra for as long as it took for my train of thought to carry me away

I would be able to do this maybe once every three days when I first started it. After about a month I was averaging three dreams every night or so. Soon after I had my first lucid dream and I was ecstatic. I didn't even do anything cool but it was incredible. 

The point of all this is that you would do well to keep a dream journal, you will. It seems impossible when you are actually laying there with an empty mind and a pen and paper in your hands and I knew that feeling once. 

But what can I do with a dream journal to become lucid?

Good question. A bunch of things. After you have like twenty or however many dream written

You will get it.

**TL;DR-** If you were that lazy that you need a tl;dr to sum this up for you then you are way too lazy for this to help you. Go do WILD a few hundred times. Sorry.

The purpose of this project is to get a little more understanding of how effective the FILD method is. Participants will be asked to attempt FILD for ten nights and report their success rate. 

**Participants**

Anyone who is attempting FILD is welcome to join. 

**Definition of Lucid Dream**

A dream in which you are aware that you are in a dream.  (Hypnogogia

**Definition of FILD**

Let's define FILD as waking up from sleep, until a dream is perceived, the process lasting usually between several seconds and a few minutes. (For now, let's not include attempts that are made when you first lay down to sleep or during naps after you have gotten up in the morning.)

**Definition of Success**

Entering a dream and being consciously aware that you are in a dream while attempting FILD will be considered success. (It is not necessary to be able to control anything in the dream or even move you dream body.) 

**Reports**

Submit your reports as a post below. Copy the format below and fill it in as you collect your data. Only reports with information on ten complete days will be included when we crunch the results.

Since most people here have probably just started trying FILD (and so your experiences are fresh in your mind), but didn't wake up and get a chance.

A couple weeks ago I laid down to take a nap. I woke up (false awakening), and she was cooking some food for me.

I was having a pretty normal dream at first, except it involved a lot of tagging/hashtags. 

I kept getting texts from someone asking me to stop ""tagging"" them or whatever, and in my dream mind I thought ""wow, that looks just about right"". It's almost if i made the connection that I was dreaming but did nothing about it. 

I get another text from this person to try out and app called Furon, Vine, Twitter pics, Facebook pics, YouTube, And Vimeo streamed all into one timeline. (This is was a fucking amazing thing to think up out of the blue, I was so surprised to find out it didn't exist. Somebody make that shit.)

Then I realized somehow, and a TV was on in the room behind me with the door closed. It seemed to be Judge Judy or something, because the narrator sounded familiar and was saying things I could make out perfectly. Again, this is really detailed shit for me to dream. I started thinking about how freaked out i'd be to wake up not knowing what that noise was, and at that moment it's like my whole brain melted. I was *instantly* awake and conscious in my bed and I got the most intense sensation of my whole brain like buzzing, warm and tingly. Nothing seemed real for a good 5 seconds.

I just found this subreddit today. I am a very experienced lucid dreamer and thought I'd offer some advice if any of you have any questions. A little background, but is very, very fun as you can imagine. 

I have always had sleep problems, when you have to think about falling asleep before you actually do. Instead of worrying or planning your day tomorrow, imagine a far away world, and build it around yourself in your head, if that makes sense. Try to think nonsensically, make up strings of words that don't fit each other until you are asleep. 

Also there are some herbal tricks (talk to a doctor first if you have medical issues or are on medications!!!) But

I can fly and know I'm flying and even ""remember how to fly"" if need be and I always fly the same way

tl;dr: I'm a life-time lucid dreamer

EDIT: I'm going to go AFK for a little bit

EDIT 2: Whoa

EDIT 3: Thanks so much, not days or weeks, it takes a long time. If you want a certain dream to happen, think about it constantly and revisit your dreams while you are a awake and talk about them if you can. 

Also, if you are female especially, be careful of it and ask a doctor or at least read up about it.) 

If you do become lucid, very natural things, but at least be concious in the dream you are making yourself do them and in turn affecting the surroundings the same way they would be affected if you did what are you are doing in real life.

**I'm scared of going into sleep paralysis; is LDing worth it?**

**[Insert question/statement about a ""dream within a dream"" here]**

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

I'm sorry, as I'm pretty sure that's what started that myth.

Anyway, you didn't. Did you ""wake up"" in the dream? That was a false awakening. A false awakening is simply when a dream suddenly switches to a new scene, which begins with ""waking up"", creating the illusion of having had a ""dream in a dream"". Did you ""fall asleep"" in a dream? Again, that creates the illusion of a ""dream within a dream"", although, once again, triggered by ""falling asleep"" this time.

When you realize that your mind has taken you away from the place you were imagining

Just be sure to keep thinking to yourself, and you will start dreaming without realizing it.  Detecting the first moment of wandering is the hardest part.

I was in Wilmington, someone placed their hand on my shoulder and spoke softly ""Beautiful, isn't it? It has been getting redder every morning for the last week."" I turned around and standing behind me was the girl I am beginning to fall in love with in real life. For story purposes, we'll call her Madeline... except in the dream, it felt like I was meeting her again for the first time.

A brief period passed where I'm not sure exactly what happened, about 60 miles away. It turns out, Madeline's mother was running for mayor of the city. Anyway, after a night of strolling along the beach front, it was like falling in love with the same person all over again. I can still see a high-definition picture of what her face looked like when we stopped and started holding each other on the beach. The next morning, the sky was now a blood-orange color and I could see the look on Madeline's face turn to pure worry. She said ""we're not safe here,"" and took me into the cellar of her house with a trap door underneath that lead to a panic room. ""She can't hear us here, but when people started becoming more technologically and intellectually advanced, we went into a sort of bunker behind the house where we waited in horror with nothing but a radio with poor transmission due to the radiation. At the top of the bunker was a 5-foot diameter pane of triple-layer bulletproof glass used for looking outside. The sky had turned the color of human blood

All of a sudden, but haunting. I was the only one who heard it, and I just fell down in disbelief as tears flowed down my face. Then, the pane of glass was ripped off of the bunker. What seemed like 200 degree air poured into the room. Frantic, I grabbed onto madeline's hand as tightly as possible, and we were going to try and make it to the secret cellar from earlier. The house was crumbling, and the earth was violently shaking. We knew we were dead, and I could see what looked like a giant orb pressing down toward the earth's surface. Another planet was getting to slam into us at full speed.

We ran inside the house, and she started convulsing rapidly with blood pouring out of her mouth. I just fell onto my knees and started crying harder than I knew was possible. Crying hard enough that blood started seeping from my skin. She was still momentarily conscious, and I scrambled back onto my feet whispering ""I love you so much"" into her ears. Her hand slowly trembled up to my face and I gripped it tightly. She tried to make a sound, but blood just started spurting out even more. Knowing she only had moments left, and I only had minutes left at best, I bent over and kissed her lips one last time. Her eyes faded backwards, and her muscles went limp. Emotionally torn to shreds, nor were words coming out of my mouth. It was just a bloodcurdling scream that had no other purpose than to show that the last moments of my life, free-falling for what seemed like a full minute before landing in molten lava. I can still feel my skin melting from those few moments where I was still alive in the magma. Everything went dark

I then became more calm because I knew he was friendly, I did not know him at all but I had a connection with him somehow. I asked him if he would like to leave with me, but he said ""No, I must stay here and watch over. You may go on your way alone"".

I left my house and began walking around my neighborhood. It was late at night and nobody was outside, and soared into the air. I flew through the air like Iron Man, hands at my side pointing down, as if rockets were pushing out my feet.

So there I am, drizzling and smoggy. The sky is painted steel-gray with under-shades of blue. All of the surfaces are coated in a glaze of dust and water. It's a miserable place. I'm a foreigner, with a very poor understanding of Cantonese – an assassin, seeking out a target, which I was only told would be found in the fish packing district. He is a turncoat, an undercover agent with valuable information about my government, which he was planning to sell to the Chinese.

The market was filled with natives, and asked her in broken Cantonese for the location of the fish packing factory. She told me it was located directly near the Gold Dragon Inn. I thought it odd for a hotel to be located in an industrial area. She pointed it out, and the hotel was a towering, sixty-something-story, new-looking white and black skyscraper. It was extremely out of place.

So, pristine. It was like the environment was absent for the building. The floor was made of marble, which was partially covered by the mud of the street. It seemed quite odd.

As I stood gazing at him

I turned around to see a hefty Russian immigrant, which is absolutely crammed full of people, gutting and working with fish. He places the dolly down and wipes his brow, and is surprised when he realizes that I'm right behind him.

“You there!” I shout at him. Pulling out the concealed Beretta from my chest holster

The other people in the factory stop what they are doing

“I'm not the man you're looking for!” He says. I pulled out the photograph I had of my target, isn't it?” I turned the photo towards him.

“Listen man, I had to come here, I had no other choice.” He reached for his wallet, and unfurled it. It was a trifold, decent camel colored leather. The bottom half, indeed had pictures of his family.

For some reason, the lapse in time, I couldn't remember how I got to find myself here – the English speaking doorman.

I slowly lowered my pistol

He looked confused.

I turned around and walked back out through the plastic separators, and it began to rain. The rain felt good.

I took deep breaths of the salty, and marveled at the fact that I wasn't really breathing any air.

The workman whom I was supposed to assassinate a second ago

I looked back down and observed the market, laughing, living. I stood by the edge of the dock and leaned over the metal hand-guards, gazing at the ocean, observing the waves, and the water currents, the wind.

The duster coat I was adorned in previously changed

It was pretty amazing.

The workman approached. “Listen, this world – everything in it, doesn't exist. You don't exist, I don't exist, we're just figments of imagination, images of a sleeping mind.” I told him.

“Bullshit.” He says.

“Look at me, and now I'm glowing like the Pope, don't you think that's a bit odd?” 

“That was a different person

“I don't know why you are even arguing with me – you're a piece of my own subconscious mind, and yet I never anticipate what you're going to say.”

“You're insane.” He said.

“Alright, the dreamer is ascended to a level a god. I can fly, warp, and the various laws of physics don't apply to me anymore. We'll take the elevator up a high floor of that hotel, and then I'll jump. Wouldn't you like to see a crazy person commit suicide?” I said.

“I don't like where this is going – listen, and then we can talk some more.”

I walked past the red doorman, and went into the lobby. A security guard sat behind a high wooden, oval desk, looking quite bored. I told him: “Listen, I taking the elevator up. You aren't interfering.” His response was a yawn.

We took the elevator up, enough of a fall to kill anyone. The hallway was full of identical white doors, all numberless. I kicked down the closest one, and entered, walking over to the glass sliding doors of the balcony, and opening it. This particular room had the king bed layout, and the balcony therefore was a bit larger

I stood out onto the railing, whom was nameless.

“Alright now

I turned around, exactly as I had said – “feather falling”. The workman had tried to grab my robes, but now simply watched in awe from the balcony, as well as various others below in the markets.

I patted down

He stood out onto the railing, I just did whatever felt natural, and pointed my outstretched palm at him. A beam of blue light emerged, and surrounded him, causing flakes of blue light to dance around him.

He jumped, as any normal person would – like a rock. A few seconds later, he crashed into the mud right at my feet with the most horrifying sound that a person could make. He was quite visibly dead, blood was pouring out of his head, and the natives surrounded him.

The metro police arrived just on time as he had said, and screaming at me in Cantonese.

“Everyone, and I pressed them against the center of his back. I could hear all of the bones become mended, snapping back into place, all the damage of the fall had become undone, and the workman inhaled strongly with a start, heaving and coughing out blood which had filled his lungs.

“He's alive!” I declared. But, the policemen especially. The workman slowly clambered to his feet, and continued to cough, holding his chest, and finally becoming upright.

Instead of thanking me, I stood up slowly. 

“I just saved your life – you jumped off the 15th story of a hotel and survived! What I was telling you was true! We are in a dream!” But before I could continue talking
“What gives you the right? To be a god in our world?” His voice narrowed out and became very hoarse

“If you're a god here, leave us god damned people alone, let us live out our lives in peace!” His face was filled with so much pain, with only the eyes, he damned me.

I looked at the crowd, even more fiercely.

The workman pulled out his wallet again, and then held them up to me again, and pressed the wallet against my chest. He wanted to hit me again, but he relented.

“What gives you.. the right... Forty years, everything.. everything I've done.. you come here and tell me that it's not real...” His voice was hoarse.

He looked up at me. “We're as real as you. We're as real as wherever you say you come from.” He took my hands, they were shaking. “Please, I beg of you, even as much as I despise you – don't forget us. Leave, but don't forget us. Keep us in your mind. Tell others or do whatever you need to do – but please, don't forget the fish market.

I looked around the circle

**Update #1 on 6/7/2013 @ 8:00am:** After reading a lot of the comments and researching a bit more, laying dormant for something just like this. I think if he ever tries something like this again or attempts to ever use drugs, we will most likely find ourselves in the same situation. Moral of the story: make sure you keep in mind ALL of your past history, even what may seem like a one-time occurrence, before experimenting. 

His family and I were finally able to visit him last night at the clinic. I am happy to report he almost seems like his normal self albeit sad, see why this happened, and to make sure to prevent it in the future. We are still waiting to speak to a doctor to get any further information besides the hypothetical theories that we have formed ourselves. I know he's going to be on medication for a bit and will DEFINITELY be talking to a psychiatrist for a while. I will do anything and everything in my power to help him along this road. I know it will be hard, but I'm just happy to see him smirking and making jokes again. I can't wait to have the love of my life back home. 

Thank you to everyone for sharing information

**Update #2 on 6/7/2013 @ 1:00pm:** His case worker called to get any more information I may have and to let me know what was going on. They apparently believe it was an isolated case, possibly Monday or Tuesday. At that time we will be having a ""family meeting"" to further discuss things and hopefully get more solid information regarding a diagnosis or anything further. He will be going to an outpatient program 5 days a week. I'm hoping this outpatient program will have more time to delve deeper into what may have happened. While I would love to believe there is nothing more to be concerned about, I think we need to search a little bit longer and harder than they did last time instead of sweeping it under the rug.

first close your eyes (obvious) then instead of relaxing and trying to drift of focus on the weird little shapes that appear behind your eyes.

(Quoted from a post on Ld4all forums)

**Step-by-step:**

The best time to practice is after 4 or 5 hours of sleep. You could also combine the practice with WBTB for maximum effect but it is not required. DO NOT do this at the start of your sleep -- it will NOT work! The only exception is afternoon naps since you enter directly into REM.
Repeat the following procedures 4 or 5 times. DO NOT attempt too many repetitions even if you don't feel anything. Remember you are not doing a WILD. You are simply setting things up for OBEs and LDs to occur at later point. If you repeat too many times you may risk losing sleep thus destroys the purpose.

1) With your eyes closed, or images, but do not strain your eye muscle. If you see nothing but darkness, that's fine. Again, we are not striving to induce dreams from the waked state, so do NOT force it. It is perfectly fine to not feel anything.

2) Listen to the noises in your ears for 15-20 seconds. Chances are you will hear some light humming and buzzing sound. See if you can hear it more clearly. If you don't hear anything that's okay.

3) Notice any strange body sensations such as heaviness, hands, fingers, abdomen, feet, and toes. Again, it is perfectly fine if you don't feel anything strange.


The above steps should be performed in a relaxed manner, and without any rational thoughts. The 15-20 seconds duration is for your reference only, so do NOT count in your head! Chances are, after a couple of repetitions you will begin to feel sleepy, to the point your mind may drift away and forget to continue the exercise. Congratulations, this is exactly the effect we are after! When this happens just pull your mind back a bit and resume from where you drifted away. If you lost count of the repetitions then simply do a new set. It won't hurt.
Find the most comfortable position and try to fall asleep as quickly as possible! The quicker you fall asleep the more likely you will succeed later in your dreams!


**What's going to happen:**

Several things may happen through this exercise:

1) After you fall asleep

2) You wake up with vibrations and other strange sensations. Hang onto these sensations will lead you into an OBE.

3) You suddenly become lucid in your dreams with no apparent reasons

4) You have a False Awakening. Unlike the first experience

5) A WILD or direct OBE. Phase entrance may occur during the repetition, and begin focusing on the sensations until you successfully enter the phase.


If all else fail you can try the following technique as a last resort. Upon waking up again


Good luck to whoever tries it

1360795147.0,18h2bi,SSILD Official Tutorial (2.0),cosmiciron,150,21,85,"**Background**

SSILD is a modern lucid dreaming technique. It is easy to learn, which literally translates to ""A Very Mysterious Technique"". This is rather fitting because at the time no one had the faintest idea why it worked. Despite this lack of theory, the feedback on the technique was overwhelmingly positive. Within just a few months we gathered many hundreds of success stories!

Building on this initial success, and with each version we saw improvements in ease of use and effectiveness. A year later I wrote the first English version of the tutorial and published it on a few lucid dream online forums. This time I chose the name ""Senses Initiated Lucid Dream"", partly to conform to the unofficial but widely accepted naming convention of LD techniques, and partly due to increased knowledge and understanding gained during the past year.

While people on these forums appear more slow to embrace a brand new technique, within only two threads.

Today,000 members. The numbers of success stories are too numerous to count. Another exciting aspect is SSILD's long-term sustainability. Whereas many techniques appear to become less effective over period as the users' initial enthusiasm wane, SSILD delivers consistent performance, turning novices to experts, and experts to masters. For example, more than a dozen members on my tiny personal forum are able to induce LDs on a daily basis. One of them even logged nearly 500 LDs/OBEs in full detail within less than a year, a remarkable achievement by all means.

**Design Philosophy**

SSILD is designed from the ground up to be simple, non-measurable mental exercises. It despises the notion that lucid dreaming is more ""art"" than ""technique"". It does not require you to be gifted or creative, in fact, there is little room for improvisation. Just follow the simple steps outlined here and you should be all set. SSILD is made so concise that if you mix in other stuff you may actually end up creating negative impact on its performance.

**The ""Cycle""**

The core component of SSILD is called a ""Cycle"". Each cycle consists three steps:

*Focus on Sight*: Close your eyes and pay attention to the darkness behind your closed eyelids. Don't strain your eye muscles though. Your eyeballs should be resting

*Focus on Hearing*: Further relax your eyes and shift your attention to your ears. If the room is quiet enough you might be able to hear some noise inside your head or the sound of your heartbeat. However

*Focus on Somesthetic Senses (Touch)*: Direct your attention to your body. Feel it and see if you spot any unusual sensations such as tingling, spinning sensations, and so on. If nothing like these can be felt, you can also try to feel the weight of the blanket, your heartbeat, temperature of the air, etc.

The repeated stimulation on the senses enables SSILD to condition our mind and body into a subtle state that is optimized for lucid dream to occur naturally. We should keep this in mind so we don't make the common mistake of ""trying too hard"" during the cycles. Beginners usually want to see things, it is better to expect NOTHING at all will happen.

**The Steps**

1). Go to bed early

2). Get out of bed and stay awake for 5-10 minutes. I suggest you visit the bathroom

3). Return to bed and lie down in a comfortable position, you may want to use the usual position instead.

4). Perform the ""Cycle"" quickly

5). Perform the ""Cycle"" slowly, your eyes will feel more relaxed, and you may get visuals such as lights, colors, or movements. You might also notice that the external sounds seem to be fading into the background. Do not get excited though. You should observe quietly and after a while move on to other senses. As far as timing goes we are flexible, but in general each step should take no fewer than 30 seconds.

During the slow cycles

6). Return to the most comfortable position and allow yourself fall into sleep as quickly as possible. Do not think too much and do not worry if it will work. The quicker you can fall asleep the more likely it will work. Have faith!

**What happens next**
One key characteristic of SSILD is that it is neither a WILD nor DILD technique. It is a hybrid. As such

1). Hypnagogia: when we enter a dream consciously, seeing lights and images, hearing sharp noises, and many more. In fact, sometimes you may encounter sensations so strange that they are beyond words. When we encounter these sensations, chances are we are already in a dream, or getting really close. SSILD is known to cause hypnagogia during the Cycles (although this effect should NOT be sought after). It's also not uncommon for you to wake up suddenly while being bombarded by intense hypnagogic sensations. When this happens you should not become excited. Be a passive observer and wait for the sensations to amplify. You could also nudge them a little bit mentally, it is important for you to stay calm when encountering hypnagogia. Do not speak to yourselves or analyze it mentally as doing so can cause the sensations to fade and eventually wake you up.

2). False Awakening: SSILD is known to cause a lot of FAs. Not any FA, you should definitely develop the habit of performing a reality check upon each awakening after doing SSILD, no matter how convinced you are about your not being in a dream. Another possible scenario is that you slip into sleep during a SSILD cycle, and an FA immediately takes over. When this happens you may suddenly feel awake and it seems you are about to suffer insomnia. Some users complained that SSILD was causing them to lose sleep, only later found out they had been doing SSILD cycles in their dreams! Once you learn to catch these FAs your chance of success will be greatly improved.

3). DILD: When you fall asleep from SSILD, you may be able to spot oddities in dreams and in turn become lucid. It is also very common for spontaneous lucid dreams to occur -- you suddenly become lucid for no apparent reason.

4). Real Awakening: You wake up again after doing SSILD. You do a reality check and this time it is real. Do not despair. You still have chances. Try to stay still, just finish the cycles and go to sleep. You will have a much higher chance to succeed this time.

**FAQ**

**Q: Can I do SSILD when I go to sleep?**
A: Yes you can

**Q: I'm used to go to bed late or have to get up early
A: I suggest you do SSILD only when you have sufficient time. Even though it does not take up a lot of time to perform, your best bet is to do SSILD at leisure.

**Q: Can I combine other breathing
A: No. As mentioned earlier, is very delicate. Mixing in other techniques will likely interfere with this state and cause negative impact on SSLID's performance. You're free to create your own routines once you master the technique, but for beginners I expect you to adhere to the instructions in this manual.

**Q: I get this itch... how am I supposed to stay still?**
A: You are not supposed to stay still! If you have an itch just scratch it. If you want to roll you roll. With SSILD you need to stay as comfortable as possible! Just do an extra cycle to compensate and you will be fine. This is in fact a major advantage over virtually all other methods.

**Q: My eyes strain/hurt when focusing on visions...**
A: Remember, if not staying still. Performing a few quick cycles will also help you relax.

**Q: I can't feel anything when doing the cycles...**
A: We cannot stress this more -- it is OKAY to not feel anything

**Q: I got insomnia after doing SSILD...**
A: Actually, you should definitely perform a reality check, no matter how convinced you are! For people who indeed suffers loss of sleep due to SSILD, I suggest you tweak your routines in two areas: 1. Reduce the amount of sleep before waking up for SSILD. 2. Reduce the time you spend on staying awake prior to the exercise.",,False,,1360795354.0,t3_18h2bi

Anyway, I constantly had the idea of lucid dreaming and the techniques in mind everytime I fall asleep. 

Anyway. The dream was short. You know why? Because after around 3 minutes I decided to fly. And that's my first advice when trying to have a lucid dream: Upon getting lucid, first you should explore the world a little bit, walk around, maybe just sit down and see what's happening. Don't decide to run or jump. It will only wake you up. Again, i ruined about 20-25 lucid dreams with this. It's extremely hard to even think about this in that moment, I know, but try.

Second advice. It's about Reality Checks. While this may sound strange and differ from other opinions by experienced dreamers, gets you excited as hell, and unfortunately wakes you up when you're not experienced. Also this happened to me a lot of times... Again, this is only my personal experience, and I do see that RCs are something really great, but IMO they shouldn't be used by beginners.

So, but don't get demotivated if you don't manage it every morning - if you don't naturally wake up, it's extremely hard to recall dreams because they tend to get ""overwritten"" by the first thoughts and impressions after waking up, for example shut up, fucking alarm clock. *EDIT: Also, when you wake up naturally, you wake up directly after an REM phase, when you get woken up though

So, the crazy stuff you would tell your buddies. The boss that turned into a slimy monster, the teacher that made a backflip in class... If you feel like your dreams aren't exactly ""crazy"", try to remember every little detail. Some people dream totally crazy stuff, some dream scenes that seem quite ""normal"" first, but even if your dreams often seem normal, try to further look at the details - was anything strange about the environment? If your dreams take place in your school for example, you start to think critically in your dreams, rather than BOOMINYOURFACE. You will

And last advice: don't except or even try to have a lucid dream when going to sleep in the evening. You won't. It's nearly impossible, this is one of the best times for a lucid dream. Your body skips all the previous parts of sleep, in which dreams don't take part in, and directly puts you in a REM phase, which is great for dreaming. The same applies for naps. 

So, sleep and everything about dreaming really varies from person to person, so you will have to see of my tips apply to you, too. I hope I could help some people!

Well, and just by chance, had been lying in bed really still trying to get back to sleep when I started feeling the paralysis starting to set in (been practicing for two weeks now and just kept trying), and this time, my 
leg wasn't doing that unstoppable twitch.   So, which was good because I wasn't expecting the transition to 
be THAT fast.  Seemed like 20-30 seconds once the paralysis had completely set in.  And then SNAP
through the entire process and all of a sudden, in it's proper place with the exception of the dog kennel, which I just now realized.   

But anyway, that I was dreaming, so I decided I was going to create an energy ball between my hands, and to tell you the truth, at the time, it was just wishful thinking.  Imagine the WTF look I must have had 
on my dream face when it actually happened!  I mean damn, it was a VERY clear state of mind.   I mean, in other dreams, you were just 'foggy' and things out of the ordinary were just accepted as normal by your brain.   But this, I could just feel the clarity of my thoughts.   

In my excitement though, it seemed like 30 seconds to a minute for the duration before I got too excited and woke up.  I've gone lucid in normal dreams before, but this WILD method was NOTHING like them at all due to my understanding that I was in a dream from the very beginning and just the sheer clarity of the dream.  Basically a mirror of real life. 

But I wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for introducing me to the concept of lucid dreaming (don't know how I originally found this), but it happened, and it far surpassed my expectations.  And now, I have 
a  more scientfic understanding of sleep paralysis that I had when I was a kid and getting freaked out
tends to point to lucid dreaming and a realization that the mind was not in a normal reality state right off the bat.

If any of you remember your dreams quite well you might have observed some pretty strange things. When you wake up and recall your dream you probably say something like ""Wow. I can't believe I didn't realize that was a dream! It was so clearly fake! I must be an idiot"" I will now address why I believe we become so gullible to such a strange world. It is because of what I like to call ""The Backwards Card House Effect""

I've noticed in several of my dreams my brain likes to begin with a very small impossible task. Something so small that you might actually consider it quite possible. For example a glitch in a game. You get a mushroom in super mario but instead gain fire powers. ""Whoa! I just glitched the game!"" Simple yet laying the stepping stones for your dream world. It slowly progresses exponentially. ""Whoa a secret level I never seen before!"" Until you believe anything your dream throws at you. Thus ""The Backwards Card House Effect"" One lie holds all the other lies in place. The 2nd row holds up the 3rd row correct? And the 3rd holds up the 4th. But if that first card is not in place the whole house comes falling down.

Thus, do a reality check. Regularly, I feel like reality checks are related to the situation you are in. Thus if you are sitting at a table and do a RC you will only do a RC in your dream if you are sitting at a table. This method I am showing you applies to all the craziness in your dream world.

Some examples I've seen in my dreams.

Background: on October 12, I got extremely drunk and fell asleep on my grandparents' back porch. I was incapacitated. My grandfather took advantage of the situation. As many could imagine, I was a bit broken by the experience. I did not recover my sense of self until two weeks ago when I watched a jury of twelve decide his guilt. This Wednesday I will go to his sentencing and watch him condemned to prison.

About two-two and a half months after the incident I had an LD that shook me to my core


This is an interpretation (with character and plot explanations) of what I wrote down in the morning when I awoke:



The dream began in the community that I grew up in. It was summer and I saw the neighborhood exactly as it had been when I first moved there at 13. I ran up my front porch and into my house to find my mother, so she returned after only a couple of minutes.

“My dad’s coming over for some food

“There’s enough for him!” chimed my mom. “Phil’s welcome any time.”

I heard our screen door open and something struck me as odd. It was when I saw his face that I realized I was dreaming. I quickly stood up and looked around me. 

“Great!” I exclaimed. 

Everyone looked stunned. 

“I’m dreaming

“I don’t feel dead

I took him by the arm and led him to my door. Before opening it I looked him in the eyes and said

I opened the door and pulled him out onto the porch with the others close behind. I pointed to the place where the shed had once stood

“You killed my father

“Calm down

I did not fear Amber in this dream. I felt protective if anything because I felt the dream momentarily destabilize and had to struggle to keep some amount of control over it. I heard a deep rumble and swung back around to face the surrounding neighborhood. The houses began to crumble, and I grabbed Amber and swung her off of the porch on the off chance that I accidentally knocked my own house down on top of her. I had no concern for my mother and her friend, as they were out of my sight, and therefore no longer technically there. 

SIDENOTE: You’re probably going to wonder why I wanted to protect Amber
 
We began to run in between the houses

We were turning a corner when I saw what would be my first obstacle. A gigantic, his jaw grinding the grass he’d collected. 

“Shit. Shit shit shit!” I whispered vehemently.
 
I stepped in front of Amber’s body to shield her before finally deciding it was time for her to leave. I wasn't about to watch something happen to her

“Run

“But…” she whimpered with wide eyes.

“GO! You’re not real!” and I pushed her hard. She disappeared around the corner and I turned to face my what I assumed was my foe again.
The giant goat was slowly bearing down on me and I stood my ground uncertainly. As he walked, and he was…beautiful. Standing at least six feet tall, he had long blonde hair and a sharp jawline, and a lean, smooth body. I wasn’t sure what to make of him. I lifted my fists as if to fight and he laughed. 

“You still aren’t very good at this

He put his left hand on my right shoulder and pushed me down. He climbed on top of me, but decided I’d rather get back to the dream. I fell back into it with no problem, but the sexually appealing satyr was gone. 

I needed to find him. 

I want to clarify that I was not seeking him out for further sexual gratification. I began seeking him out because there was something new about the encounter.* You still aren’t very good at this.* Did he mean controlling and protecting myself in my dreams? I had been having lucid nightmares for years. 

I ran around the wasteland that used to be my neighborhood for about a half an hour before giving up and walking back to my porch to wait to wake up. I walked inside of my house to see if anyone was there but it was empty. It was then that I heard a knock at the door. I opened it to see the blonde--now in full human form--in khaki pants and an over-sized red t-shirt. He jerked his head backward as if to say come on and then made a run for it. I chased him down to a hillside strewn with boulders. He leaned against a rock arrogantly

“Thanks

“For what?” he asked without looking at me.

“For coming back. You’re not like the others

“I suppose not.”

(I had often spent time with vapid dream characters who simply annoyed me with their insistence that they were not of my creation, my mother, and her friend.)

“Can I bounce some ideas off you?”

“Bounce ideas off me

“Oh shut up

“For a reason

“Bullshit! Personalities should not be split…” I trailed off. “I’m going to make a brave speculation and say you’re my subconscious.”

“Hmm… at least part of it.” He still had not looked at me.

“Look at me

“You’re bossy

“But you are

“Well

“And you touched me because…”

“You looked like you needed a guilt-free orgasm.”

I continued to study him and he looked up at me
.
“This takes self-love to a whole new level

I began to cry. “I can tell you’re stronger that me.”

“No

I sobbed silently. It was getting harder to focus on the dream; my surroundings were starting to slip. 

“You’ve got to help me! I don’t want to wake up!”

His hard demeanor cracked and I saw pity in his eyes.

“You know it doesn’t work like that

This is the last solid sentence I remember coming from him

I’m going to give you the real crazy now (I didn’t realize this until a few months ago): ever since the “meeting with my subconscious”, the voice begins overthrowing my defeatism in an aggressive manner. 

“Make your bed,” it will say, or, “Put that fucking bottle down, you drunkard, you’re on your way to destroying everything again.” Occasionally, I can banter with this voice and tell it to back off if it’s being a dick

Did I trigger this when I asked for help in the dream? People will argue.

I've had one lucid dream in my life, with creaky wooden boards and faded paint.  I can't remember what I was doing there.  I'm not sure what triggered it- elements of the dream seemed familiar, though it wasn't one of the recurring dreams I know by heart- but I suddenly had a thought: I'm dreaming, and this isn't real.  So, I did the first thing I knew I could never do in real life.

I flew.

It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  I looked up to the sky, but the speed of the flight was unexpected.  It was like I was in control, but also out of control all at one time.  It was incredible.

So

I'm not sure how long I stayed up there.  The last thing I remember is hearing my alarm go off inside of my dream.

 I'm new here so I thought I'd introduce myself. I've been lucid dreaming for a little over a decade now but I haven't applied much technique or tried to develop any sort of reliable process to LDing until I found this subreddit. 

That said I have had what I consider to be a great deal of documented* LDs since I first became aware of them. To the best of my knowledge I am averaging about 3 - 4 LDs a year with that number slowly increasing due to my own haphazard efforts. 

I cannot remember how it started in terms of technique. My LD emerged as a product of liking dreams so much that I simply wished to explore them as much as possible. I assume that this strong positive association made it more likely for my mind to spontaneously RC

These days I employ incessant reality checks. Every time my scenery changes I do an RC. Literally every time. Even something as simple as getting a glass of water can contain at least 3 RCs  (Computer Room -&gt; Hallway -&gt; Kitchen). 

As for what I can do in my dreams once I have completed an RC, and whatnot.

This community looks to be very exciting to say the least. There is a wide range of people here with an equally wide range of experiences and outlooks, to share with me some of your more profound experiences with LDing. While I am not inclined to talk about how I can fly if that is something really exciting for you please share. I only have one condition: tell me how you think you can push this further than you have already. I don't simply mean flying longer, higher, farther, or the addition of other abilities. Rather I mean to ask, how do you thin you can take this to the next level? If we are metaphorically like infants crawling about, how do we figure out how to get up and walk around, or are we simply exploring the depths of our own respective psyches? 

For example now that I am comfortable manipulating my dreams I will try to pull back the curtains

2. Maintain your journal! It may take some willpower to force yourself awake

4. Reality checking with MILD must become a habit (or a triggered reaction) to work. However, do something with a dynamic answer, like ""where am I?"" ""Is this logical?"" These will force logical thoughts, which are essential in achieving lucidity. 
&gt;Really know and think about the purpose of RCs every time you do one.

5. Lucid dreaming takes dedication. At times you will have to force yourself to do things, or simply meditating. All of these things are a necessary burden, so be prepared to sacrifice some of your time (and sleep!).

6. If you happen to achieve lucidity, and helps dream stability.

1333072127.0,rk8te,It's a dream! What now? - Noob guide to dream control.,gorat,139,19,47,"*Disclaimer: People that have been LDing consistently or want to add something

**Intro**

Ok ladies and gents, how to stabilize and how to control the dreamscape. I am about to go all buddha on you, so don't freak out, control is a lot about centering and such and a lot about attitude. No fancy terminology and all real world applications. Promise...

So without further delay, put [some music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3NlwGX-shA) on and let's get to it...

**Attitude**

Your dream is yours and yours only. Get that in your head and never forget it. Everything in that dream from the sky to the sand, its all created by your brain for your pleasure. It is there for your taking and your control. Think about all the power for a second. Feel the warmth of it going through your arms. Do you feel like you can throw a fireball right now? You should...

**You are GOD!**

and you know it! That is exactly the meaning of being lucid.

So first advice. As soon as you become lucid

**Balance is key**

Balance your thoughts between keeping a vivid dreamscape and keeping the realization of yourself. This is the balance that needs to be kept

I will give you a couple in-dream techniques and a couple real-life techniques.

**Real Life Balancing**

Take a moment and do this for me. Look away from the screen

&lt;OK just stop reading and do what I said - take a couple of minutes to get into it&gt;

If you are doing this right you should have no other thoughts beyond your surroundings and yourself. This is a good way to practice control (centering - mindfulness) and is a very good approximation of what it feels like in a lucid dream. Imagine that if you let go of the thoughts of specific things they will slowly start to become more and more fuzzy. As soon as you notice them in your thoughts they will gain life and detail. The same goes for your dream-body... Take some time every day to try this while thinking about LDing. I believe it will help with inducing LDs and with control. If you have LDed before then try to add the sensation of the dream in it...

**In the dream**

The balance between self and surroundings is the most important. If you get too lost in your surroundings the awareness of self is lost. The other way around and your dreamscape fades. So what to do?

*I am losing control of myself / overexcited*

* First do a simple RC. Remind yourself you are dreaming.
* Rub your hands together as practiced before. Calm and Center on yourself. 
* If previous steps fail: Spin around yourself looking at your hand - you may end up somewhere different or awake.
* as a last resort: Shout as hard as you can (I AM GOD) - this is fun by itself...

*Dreamscape is fading*

* Use your sensations to stabilize dream. Focus on the textures of the things around you. Focus on the colors and the details of some dream objects.
* Stop talking to people and look around.
* if other steps fail:  Spin around yourself looking at your hand - you may end up somewhere different or awake.

*Dreamscape is too dark, hot, etc etc*

You *do* know you have a remote control for your dream right? It's in your right pocket. I thought I should let you know. Take it out

Some people have the automated system installed. Clap twice and the dream becomes sunny. Clap once and it is night. Try it out

This is an example of how you must think in your dream (and I'm serious about the remote control. It's in your right pocket...) Believe and it will be done. Command with a knowledge that you are in control.

**All good things come to an end**

As everything in life

**Outro**

As soon as you become lucid don't start jumping around and being excited. Squint a bit as practiced

If you don't like something in your dream use your remote control to change it. Or your iphone if you are so inclined :)

Happy Dreaming all and let me know about your experiences!

Not all of them are nice, read carefully before you buy - especially in a start up. But that's beside the point.

Another major hit I hear is that, and therefore give future devices a bad name. Here's why I respectfully disagree with this school of thought:

When someone decides they want to make a breakthrough in, they don't get up off the couch, buy a giant supercomputer, switch it on, and watch the next great genome research magically appear on the screen - that's silly. No, they spend incredible amounts of time researching their topic, learning all they can, of course

Similarly, a lucid dreaming mask any more than a supercomputer is a bioengineering answer book. The Remee is a little mask with lights in it. It won't make you lucid dream. But it is a tool. And again, like the supercomputer, the average Joe Schmo is going to try it, have no flipping idea how to get it to tell him the answers, and write it off as useless.

But LDers are more than the average Joe Schmo. They don't just put on a Remee and hope for the best. They journal. The do RC's. They are intensely and rigorously trying their very best to dream. And they see the Remee as a tool. Some it may help, and instead will use it as a gentle alarm for WBTB, or as a breakout to do DEILD. Still others will use it for a focus point in WILD as they drift off. The list could go on, but you see what I'm saying? Remee is just a tool.

So no, or the product we've been waiting for to bring the world entirely into lucid dreaming. What it is is a mask with lights that has been put together by some guys who are passionate about lucid dreaming and want to provide us a tool.

Here's a [link](http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/126343-yuppies-deild-guide-easiest-way-lucid-dream.html) to an article with a better explanation. But here's how I do it:

What happens is, and you'll find a very strange sensation, hard to describe in words. With each breathe you'll find yourself absorbing more and more into your dream state. For me, a minimum of 3-4 breaths is enough to know that I'm in a lucid state. And now, open your eyes and you'll wake up in a dream, if done right.

Pros:

1. Doesn't require a strict sleep schedule.

2. Even if you find your dream getting out of hand and you wake up

3. Very easy to do.

4. With practice

5. Doesn't really require a reality check and although you can do one. I've stopped reality checks now because I forced myself to believe that when in doubt if it's a dream

6. Once mastered

Cons:

1. You can not control when it happens

2. You may not be as lucid as in other techniques such as wild.

3. Lucidity can be weird sometimes. I find myself seldom getting stuck to my bed or getting a quarter of my vision blocked.

Now, I'm an incredibly deep sleeper, and can sleep through my phone blaring at full volume for hours on end. Anyways, most alarms only wake me up once I've already completed the bulk of my sleep. That's what happened this morning,

Now I set 6 alarms. One at 12:30, 5:00, 6:30, and at 8:00. I slept through EVERY SINGLE ONE and woke up at 8:15ish with my phone flipping out. This is much earlier than I would have woken up naturally, so the alarms did serve some purpose, although not the intended one. Anyways, at 8:15, pissed, the same effect could be easily replicated by setting one alarm and pressing snooze each time

These alarms had kept me on the brink of sleep for 6 minutes. I laid down after the sixth utterly exhausted, because the RC didn't check out: I could breathe with my nose pinched shut! I had a lucid dream that lasted about 2 minutes by my estimate, and was pretty damn cool.

The weirdest part was that I didn't know I'd fallen asleep. I saw blackness with no change in it

Here's a step-by-step method of recreating what I did. I call it ""Mump's WILD"".  :D

1. Set an alarm that will wake you a few hours earlier than usual. The point here is to be incredibly tired when you wake up

2. Make sure your alarm has a very short snooze (1 or 2 minutes max) so that when you wake up

3. Let the alarm rouse you for a few repetitions, end the alarm instead of pressing snooze.

4. Now that you can sleep

5. This is the most important part. Do an RC after a short while. I know you won't think you're asleep

6. If it works

I really hope this will work for some of you guys out there. I know how disappointing it is when a guide promises success and yields nothing. I can't promise success; I'm just trying to help based on what I've learned. I will be happy to answer any questions you guys have

1358639292.0,16wgpi,My personal tutorial/experience with lucid dreaming.,PendulumSweep,130,22,8,"Good day everyone, just my experience.

Groundwork: The biggest issue for me in the beginning was making sure I could instantly recognize what was dream vs. reality.  There are a couple ways to go about this.  The first that I used was fairly simple.  I would find a quiet room (bathroom works) and just say this sentence out loud: ""This is my dream and I can control it"".  After a couple of days of saying this 3-4 times per day

Your first lucid dream: Try to have it in your mind ahead of time what you are going to try to experience in your first lucid dream.  Most people (myself included) choose flight.  Another thing I tried early on was telekinesis.  I would stick my hand out towards any object and attempt to will it to come to me.  The purpose of having this in your mind is I found the first time I actually acted upon a lucid dream opened the flood gates to much more lucid dreaming.  Having something simple like this to try leads to the next step in my lucid dreaming path

Totem: I stole the word from the movie Inception but a lot of people who lucid dream have some sort of ""totem"" or whatever you want to call it.  Basically it is anything that you can consistently and reliably test that can ONLY happen in dreams.  My personal test is the ability to make an object come to my hand.  Once or twice a day while awake

Those are the basics for me.  If this generates interest I have a lot more tutorial-style concepts for lucid dreaming.  I have techniques for developing the ability of flight, how to keep yourself in the dream as opposed to being pulled out of it, and I'm sure some others I can't think of.  I want to make one thing clear also: lucid dreaming is as unique as the individuals who learn it.  You may use all, some, or none of what I wrote.

If this generates any interest I'm more than happy to share more with everyone here.  Thanks to all who read the whole thing.

Dream Recall
Reality Checks

STEP 2: Reality Checks

STEP 3:

Next time I'm dreaming

The next scene will be a dream

I will have a lucid dream tonight

STEP 4:

&gt;Now we can begin the visualizations; this is my favorite part of Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dreams. But only perform this step once you are deeply relaxed and feel you could drop off to sleep quite easily.

Although you are just day dreaming (and this is by no means a lucid dream) continue to experience an imagined lucid dream fantasy. Do whatever you would do if this were a real lucid dream. You might decide to fly and explore the landscape

1. **Take care of yourself**. This can't be stressed enough. I think this comes before anything else. Before you start journals or anything new, which will relax you and put you into the right state. Regular meditation will also help you increase your melatonin levels. Get a regular sleeping routine set up. We spend *a third of our lives asleep*, so trust me, even if you're not interested in lucid dreaming, these things will make you feel more refreshed and ready to take on whatever the day throws at you.

2. **Positive thinking**. Keep telling yourself that this is going to work out and be awesome. Some people are lucky and start lucid dreaming in just a few days. Others, you'll start seeing results.

3. **Dream Journal**. Get one. Once you start getting going, and it's the middle of the night, I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) from my phone, which is neat because it syncs with my computer. There are plenty of other note taking apps and ways of doing this. Look around, do some research and find what works best for you.

4. **Think about dreaming all the time and do some reality checks!** This is also important as it is the foundation stone of the MILD technique. [I've had my own struggles with this](http://redd.it/saoi8), but I'd be interested to see who can take this idea further and help our community usher in the *new era of reality check wallpapers* ;). On the topic of dreams in general, there are loads of materials out there to help you keep your mind on dreaming, the [wikibook in the sidebar](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming) has helped me a lot. Once again, find what's best for you, and ask the community if you need help.

5. **Stay clear of scary stories**. This links closely with point #2 actually. You need to feel confident and secure in yourself. There's a lot of fear-mongering online - and at times even in this subreddit regarding sleep paralysis etc. Personally, shadows and other freakishly horrifying things, that's pretty much what you're going to see. I have never experienced these (and I now attempt a WILD every night), for a few reasons. The first is positive attitude, the second is that I set myself a task like counting, which takes my attention and thirdly, when the room spins too much for comfort

6. **Diet**. Personal experience: *bananas are good*. Green Tea also seems to help me to relax and concentrate during the WILD technique. That said it contains caffeine, just generally take care of yourself.

7. I really could go on, let it become part of your life. Have fun, and you should start reaping the rewards, be it improved dream recollection, or full blown madcap adventures with your flying pet donkey, it's up to you. **Go forth and lucid dreamify!**

For February:

* Write in your dream journal every day. If there are no dreams, and you should have a higher dream recall.

* Before going to sleep, when I am dreaming, I will see my hands in my dreams and realize I am dreaming."" When you are too tired to continue staring, lie down and visualize your hands. This does a few things: staring at your hands and a mantra will create a method similar to MILDing. You are commanding your consciousness to summon your hands in your dream. For Robert Waggoner, who cobbled this method, his hands appeared in his dreams and slapped him in the face. The visualizing your hands as you sleep will increase your visualization abilities.

Just so you can visualize this

My dream started off with me playing in a band full of saxophones. (I play alto in real life) My girlfriend was the only one in the audience, and she said yes. It was then that I realized that something was off. I mean, we've only been dating for a little under a year, and we're both far too young to make a commitment like this.

I looked around the room and realized the people playing the instruments were people I knew who couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. I grabbed my girlfriend (let's call her...Derpette) by the shoulders and told her ""Derpette, and we both agreed that it was only my dream we were stuck in.

I rushed her out into the parking lot to my car. I remembered someone posting something on here about always fucking up their lucidity by forgetting they were dreaming, but I made it so that driving the car was as easy as driving a car in a video game like GTA or Saints Row. 

I wanted to get us somewhere cool
I met up with my grandparents (one of which has passed away), to which Derpette replied ""They need to keep their feet on the gas."" as if it was common knowledge. 

When we got to the building

We went upstairs and found out that the building was actually a really fancy rehab facility for drug addicts. Someone I knew who was a recovering meth addict was there and I paid him $5 to let us use his room for an hour. (keep in mind i'm still singing ""This is all a dreaaaaam"") 

I remembered reading somewhere that you could talk to your subconscious if you tried calling yourself on the phone. I tried to take my phone out of my pocket and a bunch of socks came flying out

The person on the other line sounded like a pre-recorded voice of a woman. Kind of like those robotic telemarketers

* Subconscious: Yes
* Me: Hey... Is this my subconscious? 
* S: Yes
* Me: Uh... Okay
* S: (silence)
* Me to Derpette: What do I ask it? 
* D: Why are you asking me? I'm just a projection made by you
* Me: Good point. (Back to the phone) Tell me

This time when it spoke

* ""Because I have no girlfriend.""
* Me: Bullshit
* S: Fine. (Censored because of privacy. Subconscious did follow through though.)

After that I hung up and looked at Derpette. I was feeling pretty down

I told Derpette that we had about an hour of dream time before I had to wake up

Okay so here's the dream. I started out in a regular dream.

I was in Grand Central Station wondering around. There weren't many people there

After I killed them I appeared in the side yard of one of my old houses. Wondering how I got there I look around. When I look into the backyard, I killed them! OH MY GOD I'M LUCID RIGHT NOW!"" I stand there in amazement until I see the balloon people walking my way. Then I close my eyes and yell ""BEGONE DEMONS"" and they dissipated. I felt so powerful. I look around and see I'm in my backyard at the house I live in now, I'm assuming because I closed my eyes. Now I'm just running in circles yelling, ""OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! I'M FREAKING LUCID! I have to write this down in my dream journal and tell everyone! Oh wait! I should fly!"" So I jump into the air and assume the arms out in front flying pose and lift off. I get about 30 feet in the air and then I start to feel myself losing lucidity. I tried to focus, but I could feel my consciousness falling back down to the ground eventually fading. 

The next thing I could remember I woke up in my bed and I was running to tell my parents that I just had a lucid dream. They got annoyed that I did. Then told me to go the fuck to school. I told them

Once I did that

The feeling was amazing. I've been trying for at least three maybe four months and I finally did it! I think my trick was that I lit an incense right before bed. I will definitely be doing that again tonight.

I rolled a joint with only calea in it and brewed a cup of tea with two teaspoons of calea and had them both in succession just before bed.

So after this I thought

Unfortunately, everything was fluid, nothing strange about the dream at all and right now if it wasnt for the fact that it was written in my dream journal i could mistake that for a memory rather than a dream. Awesome stuff really.

I tried immediately to fly, but failed.  I turned around, placed my contents of my pockets onto the kitchen counter, and I found not one, but TWO remotes in my right pocket

I only took one with me, and several different buttons, However I only was able to try two buttons.  There were two 'Up and Down' buttons like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__qaQfpFMAUE/TK_ZbgYXLyI/AAAAAAAAAU4/GiiCMEOSCDM/s1600/Elevator+1.jpg) except the horizontal lines were not there, so it was a two-sided triangle:  (/\) (/\). &lt;- Like this.

So, Taller, Stronger, etc.  I stayed the same proportions, but got larger everytime I used the button.  Now when I was pressing the button, I had stepped outside first, and tried to change the environment from winter to summer. It worked(sort of). I waved my hand, and the rest winter.   ""Oh

After using the buttons, so I tried the button next to it, which coincidentally made me run faster ever so slightly.  Some kid that was walking on the street wanted to have a race, so I agreed. I won, by I have no idea how many miles.

That's all I can remember for the first part.

The second part, I'll call her Lexi for now.  Lexi was wearing a vibrant blue dress.  I thought ""I'm going to fuck her, since this is a dream."" I for some reason was repelled from doing it, and had no want to, even though I was sure I wanted to.  I took her by the hand, and a voice(sounded the same as mine) said ""If you dream too long, a guard like the guy from TRON will come get you, determined to bang her.  At this point halfway up the first flight

I cannot stress this enough. All jokes aside
Dream recall is the most important component in becoming lucid. If you can't remember your dreams there is little chance you will became aware of them while they are still going on.

Write down your dreams every morning, just record them in some fashion. 

If you do this consistently (for a long enough time) you will even naturally start lucid dreaming. But if you do it for even a short amount of time and supplement that with *any* lucid dreaming techniques

But so often

**What worked for me**
Everything that anyone has said about going to bed, then going back to sleep **is entirely true**, at least for me. Last night I went to bed attempting to WILD, fell asleep accidentally, woke up at 6, went back to bed, then BOOM. In the dream, ""this is weird, there were just six fingers there, I peed for ten minutes. I almost lost lucidity while peeing but I remembered rubbing my hands together
**What did NOT work for me**Since I'm a noob, and would feel my hands go numb and bright lights flashing beneath my eyelids. Just when I feel like I'm about to hit the next stage of WILD (around the number 250 or so), my mind would go wild and my breathing would freak out. I couldn't keep myself calm knowing I was about to enter a lucid dream and I would lose my focus and become aware of my surroundings again. This was extremely frustrating and I would say to not try WILDing unless you have had at least a couple lucid dreams, just so you know what to expect when it happens. Also, LDing came completely natural. Both times I've had a lucid dream, it's been when I wasn't 100% attempting to; they just happened. Although I've been trying since the beginning of May, this has been the most rewarding experience of my life. Don't give up or think lucid dreaming will never come to you.... it will.

1353452256.0,13j97g,Every lucid dreamer should learn DEILD (Dream-Exit Induced Lucid Dream aka Dream Re-entry Technique),CrypticRanger,109,11,34,"The dream re-entry technique


DEILD (Dream-Exit Induced Lucid Dream) is a technique that you do when you are exiting (waking) from a dream. It is also know as the dream re-entry technique because you basically wake up and re-enter the dream. It usually only takes a few seconds to go from awake to back to lucid dreaming

The dream could be a lucid dream that you accidentally woke up from or a normal dream that you woke up from and have yet to move your body. DEILD is like a WILD that you have woke up into. By that

If you move


**Here's how I use the technique:**

When I'm waking from a lucid dream

I then imagine where I want to be or be doing when I re-enter the dream. I imagine myself running because the imagined sensation of running to a realistic feeling of running is a big indicator for me that I have successfully entered the dream. I imagine the feeling of my arms swinging, and the sensation of moving forward. All these imagined physical feelings suddenly transforms into your dream body feeling and doing the actions.

You can imagine a place as well. I sometimes imagine a forest, I imagine what it would feel like to be in that place. Say I want to be in a dream forest, I imagine the smell of pine trees, the sound of leaves rustling, and the feeling of a light mist and a cool breeze. I usually combine all these senses into imagining myself running through a forest. One second, I'm imagining myself running in a forest and the next I'm actually running in a forest. Imagining an action isn't required to do DEILD, but I believe it really helps tell you when you are in the dream.

While you are imagining, the sensation is like my body is becoming stone and that I'm sinking into my bed from my feet to my head. While my body is sinking, it feels like my body is disappearing. This is where the imagined sensations come in. Sometimes, you won't notice yourself entering the dream, one second you are imagining, the next you are in the dream. It is important to keep focused on the fact that you will be dreaming very soon and to keep an eye out on when you start feeling your dream body. Sometimes, you will know immediately when you are in the dream. One time I was focusing heavily on visuals and from the darkness

Once you successfully enter the dream, you can either wake up again, have a very hazy lucid dream, or the dream can become non-lucid. I usually stabilize by rubbing my hands together and focusing on the sensation. I also survey my surroundings and focus on tiny details. I take up to 5-10 seconds to stabilize so I can make sure the dream is as vivid as I like and that I won't wake up as soon as I start doing stuff. Remember to stabilize when you feel you are losing the dream again or if the dream starts losing vividness.

You can do this technique many times in one night. Be aware that your recall will suffer from this if you use it too many times in one night and you might have difficulty remembering dreams from earlier that night. If you aren't sleepy enough after waking


**== TL:DR ==**

DEILD stands for Dream Exit Induced Lucid Dream, such as running, or a place, such as a forest. Imagining can help indicate when you have entered the dream successfully, but it is not required. You will enter sleep paralysis and the imagined sensations (if you imagined any) will become realistic and you will enter the dream quickly. Do a reality check and **STABILIZE**. Use this technique as many times as you want in one night at your own risk because it can affect how well you recall dreams from earlier that night. 

That should be about it

1337954812.0,u4gz7,Calea Zacatechichi - Its worth a try.,mikepixie,109,11,48,"I am a bit of a lurker here and have been experimenting with Lucid dreams for around 12 years. I tend to go through patches where I want to and other patches where I prefer to enjoy my dreams and the good dream recall I have aquired from lucid dreaming.

I have not seen anyone mention Calea Zacatechichi in this sub so I thought I would take the liberty. Also known as Mexican Dream Herb

I had many amazing experiences on it but eventually stopped using it regularly due to the fact that I started waking up more tired than I was before going to bed. While sleeping on calea your dreams can become so vivid and real that they can exhaust you. I can honestly say that I occasionally I woke up having experienced the kind of time scales they talk about in INCEPTION

Another tool I found useful was Salvia tincture. I would take a few drops of salvia tincture just before going to sleep and found that I gained lucidity almost every time. I decided to try using Salvia as a lucidity/dream inducer as I had read in a psychedelics encyclopedia (Possibly the one by Hoffman) that traditional users would make a salvia pouch and keep it in their cheek until they achieved a visionary state. I also found that salvia while sleeping is not as unpleasant as salvia while awake.

Has anyone else tried Calea or Salvia for inducing lucid dreams?

TL;DR: Mexican dream herb is some interesting stuff.

About 17 months ago, but I finally managed to control my dream a bit. Sort of.


First, like where you rub your hands together and whatnot, and just kind of chilled for a while. Then I spotted a face out of the crowd. Let's call him ""Tom."" He was a friend of a friend, and I barely spoke to him before. He was pretty good looking though, so why the hell not? I decided we should hang out.


We chatted over lunch (although I can't remember us actually eating) then hung out at his place. It feels like we spent forever talking because we had so much in common. We shared similar views on life, video games, etc. I knew he was pretty good at video games in ""real life,"" so fuck it, we're playing video games together.

He was better at starcraft than I was, went to the movies, and had a real good time.

Then I think I kind of lost my lucidity, a Dr. Pepper in hand, asking ""What's wrong, babe?"" and I find myself sitting on his bed in his dorm room. **Why did it feel like I knew this guy for months?** For some reason, I felt really relaxed, and everything felt completely normal. It wasn't weird that I was sleeping over at this dude's place. It wasn't weird that he called me ""babe."" The dream went on like everything was normal, then I woke up for real.


I felt that complete sense of dread again

All those bits of the dreams were really fragmented and distant time-wise in my head

This dream happened a year ago, especially on nights when I go to bed stressed. In addition, I see Tom every few months or so in the ""real world"" because we have mutual friends. Let's call real-life Tom, Thomas. When we hang out at our mutual friend's apartment, he sometimes talks about video games and stuff, and I can't help but think ""Tom and I used to talk like this."" What gets me most is when he casually goes to the fridge and grabs a Dr. Pepper. Fuck. That was Tom's favorite soda. What's even more ridiculous is that I didn't even know Thomas drank soda, let alone Dr. Pepper


My psychiatrist (who I see for reasons unrelated to that lucid dream) asked me about my relationship history. He specifically asked me if there was anyone I was strung up on or couldn't get over

1362942283.0,1a1afy,Most vivid and prolonged LD after Magic Mushrooms,Phlebin_Harnwell,134,40,53,"Yesterday was a beautiful day

I got home and ate and then went straight to bed, when I would have woken up and recorded my dream. I passed out again and then went into an extremely vivid and prolonged dream, that stayed vivid the entire time. I didn't have to spin or do anything to keep the clarity up. I woke up at 8:30AM and forgot to record it immediately, and then I showered and made breakfast and called my girlfriend. After I was done with all of that, it was like 11AM and I decided I should record my dream. It still felt and feels vivid as when I just woke up.

Magic Mushrooms really enhanced my ability to pay attention to the things going on around me. I think it took my ability in ADA to a higher level, which makes LD-ing easier to do.

Edit: **nsfw** because of the subject of a drug
___________________________________________________________________________________________
For anyone who cares - here is what my dream was. I apologize that it's not the best written dream.
    I was in some sort of Zombie safe haven community - it seemed like a jail though, it was a retro cartoon movie in black and white that had a really nice soundtrack. There were 4 rows of wooden chairs, each row had about 8 chairs in it, and so there were 32 people watching this movie. I was in the second row, about the middle - and I noticed Geddy Lee was sitting in front of me and he had his bass. I asked him if he’d play his bass along to the movie soundtrack and he did. Then he turned around and said something about how this movie really made him feel things he hadn’t in a long time, and he was crying.
Then I walked to a different building in the town. It was a really dingy locker room. When I walked in, probably about 8 years old, led me to a stall and opened it. The front ⅓ of the toilet was missing and it had black mold all over it. I decided I’d just go outside. I walked down the aisle that the stalls were in until I came to little cubicles being used as shelters, They were probably 5x5 cubicles, and they just had a curtain for privacy. A giant black kid, who was probably my age, came out of one and I couldn’t stop staring at him because he was like 7ft tall and had a really warped face. His eyes were big and bulgy, and his traps seemed to come up to his ears on his thin shoulders. Then his father came out
Then I was outside of that building, but extended back unusually long. The front room was trashed, and there was a glass window wall, with a wooden door, that led to the next room. The next room was about 5 feet deeper than the first room, so you had to walk down steps to get into it. It was flooded and had sand dunes in it that you could walk on to avoid being wet. This room was massive. It would have been…something like 50x120x20 (wlh). Once again, there was another glass wall with a wooden door on it that led to the next room. My party noticed that there was a zombie in the next room, it took a while to get the door open, I could see the sky - looking back, when zombies started ambushing me. Some came from the puddles and some just appeared. There was one I remember that looked like a male nurse who had been bitten and was dead for a while

Keep in mind that there are diffrent ways to lucid dreaming and diffrent types work on diffrent people. Some people might master this technique in a week

Be sure to do this every night for a week atleast. Practice means perfection and it's not like riding a bike

-

Note: Make sure you are relaxed before going to bed. Don't go straight from your computor or video games to your bed. Read a book

-

Step 1: Make sure everything is quiet around you before you sleep. Turn off radio/TV/computor

Step 2: Go to bed and sleep in a position you feel comfortable in.

Step 3: Breath in a calm manner. Try image you become more heavier every time you exhale until your body becomes so relaxed as if it feels like it's going numb. You can also focus on those tiny movements and flickering dots on the inside of your eylids.

Step 4: Repeat step 3 until you get a ""signal"". Some people get the feeling that the are afloat
Yours will be personal and you will notice. Once you get the feeling it is now time to ""leave your body"".

Step 5: Focus hard on the feeling of your mind leaving your body. Imagine you would raise and sit up in your bed
NOTE!: Some people find this last transition frightening. Kind of walking through a dark forest at night
(I myself got a scary feeling the first times aswell but eventually i overcome it and successfully got into the dream.)

Step 6: Should you succeed in step 5 then you should find yourself in a dream. The place you would most likely find yourself in first should be your bedroom since that was the last image the brain remembered before falling asleep thus projecting.
If you are unsure

Side note: Your lucid dream should last for about 4-6 hours before you enter deep sleep or if you get interrupted or awaken. You will not succeed the first nights doing this.

Very pregnant, I was in the middle of a bloody zombie attack. My two friends and I were surrounded and being overpowered. We knew we couldnt touch the blood or get bitten or we would become one of them.

With my steaknife I managed to actually saw the head off a few zombies

I managed to yank the brain out of a recently severed zombie head

My friend ran in the room

Tears in my eyes I noticed it was getting dark and looked at the clock on the wall. SUDDENLY I KNEW I WAS DREAMING. 

I looked down at the mutated brain in front of me searching for a solution. I remembered that if I imagined something as a possibility to go wrong it would. I meeded facts. First fact I told myself: if a zombie brain touches yor skin you dont slowly change. Scientists just proved it immediately sucks out all endorphans from yor brain in attempt to stay alive, thus putting themselves in more dangerous positions that they are actually bitten and become one.

I smiled, and got angry at my dream self for not being more prepared. I walked over to the cupboard and pulled out a machete.

This time I'm ACTUALLY awake. And again, or I was dreaming about being lucid. So I guess, I'm looking to know whether I was actually lucid or not. Ironically enough, the part of the dream that feels the haziest is the ""lucid"" part. 


TL;DR: I dreamed I was lucid dreaming, woke up AGAIN for real, and now I can't tell if I actually had a lucid dream or not. :/ Blah.

The higher you are up the graph means the more awareness you have and the closer you are to lucidity.

-Before sleep: Think/read about lucid dreaming nightly. Just having it in your brain and think about it before you sleep. Very much like MILD, ""I will become lucid tonight."" I have both ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"" and ""LucidAbility,"" courtesy of some Reddittors and have been reading them nightly.

-When in the dream: Rubbing your arms/hands. I've felt myself slip away on some occasion and rubbing my arms (as if I was cold) helped me feel that I was still there. It them helped me notice details that I haven't noticed before (like the grains in the concrete sidewalk) and helped me refocus on the dream. I basically walked around 75% of my dream either rubbing my hands or my arms.

-When I woke up, didn't move or open my eyes and tried to go back to sleep. I quickly entered SP (I could feel my body just go limp) and entered into the same dream within minutes, also lucid.

So for those of you who don't know what the ""shadow"" is, including  the most recognizable ones: the anima, the shadow, and the hero. [The shadow is basically that aspect of your personality that is  unconscious and tends to be negative. Those parts of you that you don't wish to embody consciously (maybe because your society does not condone such behavior) and thus repress.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) You unknowingly project these things onto other people if you don't consciously accept them. Confronting these archetypes is part of Jung's process of individuation, in which one's personality-development completely rounds out. Worth reading about. So, I started looking for my shadow in my lucid dreams. 

In the first dream wherein I think I met my shadow, and every time I tried to confront it, it ran. I think it did this because I wasn't really nice to it either and saw it as a bad thing. I said ""HEY! Are you my shadow?"" kind of in a shitty way.

The second dream, but I have no idea what it might be or what it might do. As soon as I hesitantly take a step forward to open it, the door swings open. This woman jumps out and lands on top of me and realllly awesome sex commences. That's about it. I guess that was last summer.

Well, but had some weird adrenaline-y emotion. I was more brave this time around, less hesitant. I saw this hooded figure that I was terrified of, but decided to approach nonetheless. As soon as I took that step forward signifying I would confront it, it revealed its face: a terrifying dark cloud of voices which reminded me of that black thing in the elevator in ""Scrooge""

THIS IS WHAT YOU WISH YOU WERE NOT

THIS IS WHAT YOU DENY ABOUT YOURSELF

I AM WHAT YOU'RE ASHAMED OF

And abunch of sentences along those lines being shouted simultaneously. It was horrifying but exhilarating. All of this happened in a very short period of time, even though they are pretty much indistinguishable. It wasn't her, but reminded me of her.)

We preceded to have the *greatest* sex for the rest of the dream. Every detail was there. It was actually better than any waking sex I've had. 

Why is my shadow having sex with me? It's making the move

TLDR: I'm having sex with my archetypes

Succeeded on some of the previous tasks? Some new tasks will be given to you


**Repost of the first thread:**


For 2012 (to early 2013), I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall. And give ""tasks"" to train your skills.


**Repost End**


**This Month's Golden Tip :**
*Many people will get really excited after realising their dreaming. This is a pretty normal thing

**This Month's Tasks:**

* Control the weather. Create a tornado

* Create a landscape from /r/ImaginaryLandscapes. It has some beautiful landscapes

* Change into an animal! Fly with wings


**This Month's Master Task:**

The skills a master has is to have full control of your dream and have the possibility to summon landscapes and huge buildings in one second. You dont need to do this one if you know you cant. but you can ofcourse always try! 
I always try with the Master task to combine the three master points:

* summoning big things like landscapes and/or buildings


* control DC's


* And test the ability to stay lucid for a long period

This Month's Master task is to reconstruct a Space fight. You need to:


* Create some huge HQ ships. Maybe some asteroids

* Let hundreds of little ships fight each other and let them fight you.

* Fight on one side and destroy the HQ ships

Good luck with everything and feel free to give suggestions for other tasks and to post your succes or failure down below. 
The ones who succeeded the Master task will be named next month!

Lucidity is the art of detachment.

In my dream, breathtaking eyes and a contagious smile and the feeling her face evoked is honestly the only thing that remains etched in my mind. I remember brief moments in time of us together, in the mall, with friends, sharing intimate moments, visiting faraway places and countries I’m sure don’t exist. We were so in love and perfectly happy. I remember a feeling of absolute bliss. I’m actually crying as I write this now because the emotions are still there. I had all these memories as clear as if it was a full life actually lived.

Then, I can’t remember where or why, and I told her I was waking up. She nodded and just held me and I started to cry so hard because I knew I was going to lose her. I held her so tight because I knew these were our last moments. I could feel myself drifting back into this world, and every single memory we had together of the life we lived was being wrenched from my mind into oblivion. It was like I was losing pieces of my soul, and watching my soulmate vanish in front of me piece by piece. I kissed her as long as I could and held her tight. I started screaming in anguish, tears streaming down my face, and feeling a pain as real as if my closest companion was actually dying before my very eyes. My deafening screams settled into quiet whimpers and I awoke alone and covered in sweat. I still felt the pain though. I felt the absence – something missing. 

But here is where it gets truly bizarre. At some point last night, I forced myself to lie down and fall asleep. In this dream I had total control of everything that occurred. It was as if somehow, because I was already asleep, the boundaries of reality no longer applied and I could shape the thoughts and images I saw. In this ‘dream within a dream’ I went back to look for her. Because this dream is so many layers deep, I cannot remember the details of it, but I remember the objective clear as day, to make her real again. I remember thinking of exotic places and they appeared. Dreaming of terrible dragons and creatures and they appeared. But no matter how hard I tried

Then, but none so profound. This morning, I awoke and went about my daily activities. But then somehow, it all came back like a tidal wave washing over me. The sadness, the longing for a person that I couldn’t even recreate in my head. I felt again the pain that had brought me screaming back to the surface sometime in the middle of the night. Here, in front of the bathroom mirror, I cried deeply again. 

So, on a path not taken, before being pulled back into my own?

Curious about this method

Before hitting the sack, then slipped my phone under my pillow and fell fast asleep.

Fast forward to 6AM, I made the fatal mistake of snoozing instead of deactivating the alarm, before throwing it to the foot of my bed and lying back down.

Looking around my room in the morning light

Just as I was about to take advantage and get creative

The reason? Having not properly turned off my alarm

So what have I learned? Well, so maybe it wouldn't provide quite the same tipping point for beginners, but it worked for me. That said, *make sure you turn that damn alarm off*! Otherwise you could find your dreamland adventures ending a little earlier than expected.

So it's like this. I wake up, darker than dark. And I can't move. I can't wiggle a toe, breathe, move my arm, blink. Nothing. And there's a figure. 

This figure is darkness personified. I thought everything else was dark? Everything else is noon in Antarctica compared to this- figure. They call it the 'old hag'. And it's sitting on the foot of my bed

And I've never been this terrified. I can hear my heart pounding and I want to scream

And then after what's probably only a few seconds but feels like hours I don't want to scream or hit anymore. I want to pull the blanket over my head and cover my eyes like a child. I want to whimper and cry like a baby because darkness personified is on my chest

Sleep paralysis has been happening to me, because I achieved lucidity a few times and it was amazing. I miss it, but I'm too scared that it will make my SP worse to try it again. 

I'm scared to sleep. I cry at night because I'm so terrified of it happening again. I just woke up from one bout of it

Please help me. 

Edit: I don't know if this is relevant, but not nearly as bad as SP.

Second dream ""explained"" my first dreams pains. I now thought I was awake and the pain was coming from a girl a was with in bed pushing on my chest. I realized it was just another dream when she had very deformed breasts and when I got scared a hand grabbed my hand from under neath the bed. I noped out of my room realizing that was not my house. I knew it was a dream so I  tried flying because I know people usually wake up when they do. I flew about 20 feet  high and about a mile  long.

People stayed appearing around me and she started to bleed out of her eyes and mouth and was  zombie like. But I had control and slapped her into normal. After a while I  wanted to wake up and I  did but into another dream. 


Thrid dream. I was  paralyzed in my bed I called my dad to wake me up and he helped me do so. Then I noticed a red vent in my room that doesn't exist.

Did you succeed on some of the tasks from the previous month? I will be giving you the new ones right after the repost from the creator *Oneireus*


**Repost of the first thread:**


For 2012 (to early 2013), I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall. And give ""tasks"" to train your skills.


**Repost End**



**This Month's Golden Tip :**


*To increase your summoning skills, there will be a tree"". imagine in your head how the tree will look like while turning.*


**This Month's Tasks:**


* Another ""Explore your dream world"" version: taking a cab. we already know the walk version in wich you just walk and see where you go but with the cab version the dream world will take you to new places. you summon a cab, walk out and enjoy. Ive been to some weird, yet beautiful places by using the Dream cab.


* Suggested by /u/gobazooba i quote: *""Jump through a mirror like a portal or just summon a portal gun.""*


* We know skydiving but what about taking it a little further? Free fall. Falling on a pillow ofcourse.


* Ski from a huge ramp!


**This Month's Master Task:**

The skills a master has isn to have full control of your dream and have the possibility to summon landscapes and huge buildings in one second. You dont need to do this one if you know you cant. but you can ofcourse always try! 
I always try with the Master task to combine the three master points:

* summoning big things like landscapes and/or buildings


* control DC's


* And test the ability to stay lucid for a long period


This month you will go back to a siege in the Middle Ages. you need to:


* Summon a big castle


* Have DC knights around the castle and inside.


* be general of the attacking group and capture the castle. 


Good luck with everything and feel free to give suggestions for other tasks and to post your succes or failure down below. 
The ones who succeeded the Master task will be named next month!

A couple of things about the dream. I apparently spawned a black Suburban and drove it to my high school ex's house. It was raining hard, I'd fall. No pain whatsoever though, I thought that was pretty cool.

I also tried the typical ""count your fingers"" reality check several times throughout the dream. It made everything clearer except my fingers themselves. They seemed to fade away just before the middle joints. I could still count the nubs, I knew there were only 5, and I thought surely I couldn't have miscounted that badly on something so simply. I spent quite some time reassuring myself that I only had 5 fingers per hand before I realized my ex's dog had realized I was floating around their house. The family formed a search party to investigate, as it was the middle of the night, and I panicked and back-stroked away in the air (in real life, that's the easiest way for me to swim). Finally, a barrage of text messages woke me up, I was still relieved the family never caught up to me.

I closed reddit and thought to myself that perhaps this summer I would make a project out of trying to lucid dream. I would go buy a nice notebook to journal in and maybe convince a friend to join me in the effort. I had no thoughts and made no effort to lucid dream as I went to sleep. In fact

During the 12 hours that I slept, but one of them for sure. From inside, we opened the front door. A car was driving by and we were worried we would be discovered in the building. Confidently, I opened a rain umbrella to cover our faces and upper bodies while we stood still in the doorway. The driver drove on by without seeing us. My plan worked!

We walked out and around the door to where we could see the posted hours of operation for the store. We learned the store would be closed on Sunday (the following day in this dream)

I turned around and discovered the woman was gone. Huh. Where did she go? I thought she may have gone back inside. I tried to get back into the building through the door

I casually decided to try the ""reality check"" I had read about in a couple of the r/LucidDream/ posts that said one should try to count the fingers on one hand. I lifted my left hand up in front of me and started counting in my head

I was extremely excited and absolutely aware that I was dreaming. I remembered reading about a ""stabilizing technique"" that said one should rub their hands together. I did that. 

I still wanted to find the woman. I thought about trying to materialize some kind of box-shaped tracking device that I could hold in my hands that would show me the woman's location

I remain a little bit skeptical that this was a lucid dream and not some kind of coincidence. What I can tell you for sure is that in the dream I was absolutely convinced that I was dreaming and consciously tried to manipulate the dream,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,t3_1c2an0

1332826219.0,rfh5h,Tips for WILD,gorat,112,28,49,"*Disclaimer: All people are different and things that work for me might not work for others - so more opinions from people that can WILD consistently are encouraged and will be incorporated in the text*

Just wrote a [guide to dream control for once you get in the LD](http://redd.it/rk8te). Enjoy...

---------------------

So I've been reading topics the past few days and it seems that a lot of people are attempting WILD. A lot of new people are trying too with varying degrees of success and some horror stories for the unlucky. So I thought I should give some advice and other people

**What is WILD**

You are basically trying to trick your brain into believing you are sleeping while you are still holding your consciousness awake. After the brain decides you are in fact asleep it will start dreaming and so you will enter the dream directly keeping your consciousness.

**How to do it**

The basic step of WILD is that you have to get to sleep while keeping your consciousness. People use different incantations or mantras that they repeat to themselves (""Sleeping body - awaken mind"" or something like that)

**What will happen?**

Your brain will start sending signals to different parts of your body to make sure that they are ""asleep"". In reality this all happens inside your brain. 

Have you ever had that ""falling"" feeling while half asleep? It can be something like that. You MUST NOT move when this happens.

Another common occurrence is a tremor in the legs or arms or a feeling of numbness. This is also normal / don't react.

Heart racing, DO NOT REACT!

For me the point where I feel that it's almost over is when I start hearing things (test of the ears) and there is something like a bang! followed by a sucking sound... Perfectly normal - carry on - nothing to freak out about...

**Sleep Paralysis**

So you went through all that. Well done you are now legally asleep as far as your brain is concerned. Your body is paralysed and you are sleeping. But you played a trick on your brain. You are conscious and you know you are asleep. Now you have a choice:

**Open your eyes**

Think of somewhere nice to be and open your eyes. You will probably wake up in your bed anyway. The experiment has failed... Or has it? COUNT YOUR FINGERS. If the answer is not 5 (or if you cannot see the fingers properly) then you are in luck! you are dreaming and you can move as well... go have fun!

**Sit Up THEN Open your eyes**

I prefer to sit up and then open my eyes. In this way my brain cannot trick me into thinking I am paralysed and freak me out. Advanced techniques can also be to fly out of your body and then open your eyes.

**Scary Shit**

So you opened your eyes and lo and behold you are in your room with some [nasty company](http://redd.it/t4kky). You feel you are going to shit your pants

Well there is not much you can do and that is why WILD IS AN ADVANCED TECHNIQUE! you will have to use moves that you only learn through lucid dreaming to trick your brain into letting you go to the dream and not representing to you what you fear is happening to your paralysed body.

So please please [try some of the easier techniques before WILD](http://redd.it/rgpse). Except if you like this shit in which case you will probably wake up and find a really hot babe next to you ready for sex. In which case enjoy :)

**Things to try instead**

All the cool kids are WILDing... or that's what you think. In fact there are a lot of easier and more effective techniques you can try:

**The real WILD (Morning WILD)**

A ""morning"" WILD without the scary shit. You wake up preferably about 6 hours after you fell asleep

**Re-enter Dream (DEILD - Dream Exit Induced Lucid Dream)**

Basically when you wake up from a dream

**Non-wake=&gt;dream techniques**

There are like a million techniques that help you get into dreams or make you realise you are dreaming while you are in the dream. I will not go into these right now

Enjoy and if there are useful comments I will incorporate them in the text...

I hope you all could succeed some tasks of the previous month. Before we start i'll give a short repost from the first task month created by *Oneireus*

**Repost of the first thread**

For 2012 (to early 2013), I will post ideas on how to improve lucidity, awareness, and dream recall.

**Repost End**

So to improve the lucid dreaming task months i will add every month a tip to help improving your abilities and a task for the ones who master the art of lucid dreaming. So the master task is not obligated for the ones who are still practicing.

**This Month's golden tip:**

*Reading about lucid dreaming can help a lot. Besides a book

**This Month's Tasks:**

* As suggested by u/jjoonn56


* Explore your dream world! after realising you are dreaming and doing the RC's


* Skydive. Believe me


* Step into a car and race. Do impossible stunts wich would probably kill you in real life!


**This Month's Master task:**


The skills a master has is to have full control of your dream and have the possibilty to summon landscapes and huge  buildings in one second.   
So this month you need to start a succesful space launch. 
You need to: 
* Summon a launch platform with a rocket

* Wear a full space suit

* Have DC's checking everything and talking to you through the radio

* Have a succes launching in wich you need to get high enough in space to watch the world

Feel free to give suggestions for tasks for the next month. Also post your succes or failure! Especially when you succeeded on the master task.

Good luck everyone!

A couple years ago I had a lucid dream and decided to try asking my subconscious mind to let me lucid dream every time. I looked around for a door and said to myself ""When I open this door I'll be on a stage, I don't even know how my mind remembered all those people in just a few seconds.

Anyways, and that they're in my dream, then I ask them for a favor: ""Next time you see me, please try and convince me I'm dreaming"". They all agree and I can't really remember what happens next.

A couple days later a friend of mine is running towards me yelling that he has something important to tell me. He finally reaches me and tells me that I'm dreaming. I tell him to not to do that, and tells me to do a reality check. I really am dreaming! And ever since, every few dreams, one of my dream characters would convince me I'm dreaming, even going as far as reminding me of things I wanted to do when I lucid dream or telling me to call for them if I ever need anything.

All my intentional lucid dreams are initiated from being awake.  First, and I imagine a dream that I would like to have.  Initially I visualize the dream as a painting (i.e. two dimensional).  I then begin looking into the painting and forcing the painting to wrap around me and become 3D, as if I am stepping into the painting.

Once I can feel the scene has become tactile and real (not sure how to explain it

My tip might work for you or it might not

Pick a day when you can sleep in as long as you want without noise or other things that could wake you up. Sleep regularly, or get someone to wake you.

I can tell when I'm about to fall asleep

In the state of being conscious but about to fall asleep at any second

What I found in doing this is that I get loads of false awakenings. When I did this one morning

Remember to check for false awakenings though

The problem was that the lucid dream always started in my room with me in the bed, but several dreams in and I was too bored (I kept waking up middream so I reentered this state many times) so I decided to fly out the window to the scenery...and fell! But I was still dreaming and went exploring on the mountain i fell into.

Please try and tell me if it works for you!



How I Check whether something is a dream or not:
I don't use reality checks. I've been lucid dreaming for a while and I can just FEEL it when it's a dream. Stand still and feel the dream. For me, but in my dreams I never feel this weight of sadness, so it's easy for me to differentiate.

There were big barrel chested men with bald heads and beards brewing beer. I rode up the stairs (awesome) and rode around of the second level and looked at the big beer tanks.

Here are some suggestions for other users based on my experiences with it so far and based on my previous experience as a long-time lucid dreamer.

1. Program your Remee to display the lights later in your sleep cycle rather than earlier. You have more frequent periods of REM sleep later in the night and the individual REM cycles last longer. If you program the lights to display later

2. Use lights as a trigger for a reality check. (You can start practicing this in advance even if you haven't received your Remee in the mail yet.)  Throughout the day, whenever you see a flickering light (even a candle), whenever you see a car's headlights passing you, etc., perform a reality check. This will make you much more likely to notice Remee's lights in your dreams and you'll already be prepared to do a reality check every time you notice them.

3. Use Remee in conjunction with the Wake Back To Bed technique. If you're not familiar with WBTB, you should spend that 30 minutes reading about lucid dreaming or performing some other relaxing lucid dreaming-related activity. But, stay off the computer or cellphone since the light from the screen can affect your brain and wake you up too much.)  After 30 minutes, go back to bed and fall asleep while fixing in your mind the idea that you'll become lucid in your dreams. If you're doing a WBTB session, you can program your Remee to go off 30-40 minutes after you go back to bad. That will usually be enough time for you to fall back to sleep and slip into an REM cycle.

I should also mention I have no affiliation whatsoever with the makers of Remee. I've been lucid dreaming for many years,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,t3_14020t

I'm starting off by saying I've had two or three before

First 1 -  Running on the motorway 


The dream started with me jogging along this motorway /highway. The tarmac was pure black, and it gave the road a glossy shine 

Have you seen the movie Inception
That's what happened to me, I felt myself moving as somebody does when they jog. Yet my legs didn't feel like they moved, and I skipped some of the motorway, I would look ahead, and find myself near there, like I've covered distance while looking. While I was running, I felt this presence behind me on the right, and identified it as my consciousness. I thought stay relaxed

http://www.imgur.com/nZa4r.jpeg -  the motorway looked like this

Part 2 -  Flying 

I once had a lucid dream I flew
I started to fly and I skimmed my house roof and I was away,  I hit a lamppost I think? Then I flew just about into my room window, but I felt sad to go back 


Part 3 -  Not sure if dream ended or I woke up?? 

When I entered the room, I then closed my eyes and didn't wake up again .  I don't think I actually woke up for that moment, because the room didn't feel right somehow angle wise? 

Even though I wrote a lot here


I'm writing this because I hope somebody enjoys it and because I suffer from depression and it felt amazing to have this dream and feel so happy and free

1375661828.0,1jpjjy,Saw something interesting on Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman that may help with RC.,Burn0Things,102,24,12,"In this last season of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman

During one of the segments of the show it shows how one researcher discovered that scents have a backdoor access to our sleeping minds.

 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/science/study-shows-learning-of-smells-and-sounds-in-sleep.html?_r=0

Basically the brain can learn when associated with scents while sleeping. 

What I propose is that we use this to our advantage and use a reverse method. To learn an association while we our awake and trigger it while we are resting. When you do an RC associate it with a scent, etc. 

After a few weeks of of programming your mind to associate RCs with your selected scent

Perhaps a timed power stip:

http://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-7-Day-8-Outlet-Power-Strip-Timer-15077/100685866#.Uf7sIJKmhqg

With an oil diffuser:

http://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/economy-ceramic-burner-rustic-mauve.html?___store=default&amp;gclid=CL_nmbSB5bgCFQJqMgodty4A-g

Set it to go off to go once or twice during your sleep cycle for 10 minutes at a time.

Just an idea

TL;DR:
 

1.Scents can access mind during sleep

2.Train Mind to associate RC with selected scent while awake.

3:Release scent with timed oil diffuser at night while asleep to trigger programmed RC while in rem sleep.

Next thing I know, looking for someone and then it just clicked: *why the fuck am I in a factory...*

I thought I must be dreaming

I continued walking and found who I was looking for (let's call her Sarah). What's strange is that in my waking life
Whatever.
Her and I were walking around, darting between rooms, until I finally see someone come through the door and come at us. 

I was pretty scared
And just like that

This went on for a bit until Sarah said

My nap was ended early by one of family members slamming the door. I then tried to focus on getting back to my dream and I chanted in my head that I would become lucid. Sure enough I was in the Skyrim universe battling enemies in a dungeon where I then did a reality check and the best feeling came over me. I describe it as a vibration throughout your whole body. The dream began to fade and I rubbed my hands together and everything became clear again just like magic.

What caused me to have my first lucid dream tonight was the realization of something that could not exist in real life. I've always had dreams about Greece, that if something in my dream was somehow connected to Greece, that I should realize that it was a dream. But as we all know, it's not as easy as it seems. 

In the dream I was just in my class at school when I noticed a classmate from Greece. I greeted her, etc. But then I noticed that she's from Greece and laughed about how I always dream about my classmates from Greece. But then something happened. It just clicked. An association was made with dreams and past experiences. 

""It couldn't be, and it stabilized. 

I didn't do anything special, but was more amazing is that I had absolutely full control over my conscious actions. It was unbelievable.

So there

I spent the entire month researching lucid dreaming, MILD, etc), keeping a detailed dream journal, doing reality checks *everyday*, and in general, being completely obsessed with the idea itself. 

I've had so many failed attempts that I wanted to just abandon everything, because something you're obsessed with in real life will always find some way into your dreams. *You just have to give it time and keep trying*.

2) Don't go overboard. Dreaming fantastical worlds into existence, because you've already done everything you've wanted to try.

3) Physics may not be a necessity in a dream, and can be appreciated a little more....

4) No Wild Sex. I know, i wanna fuck a million hot women/men...."" okay, but don't sit there and go crazy. if you do, you wake up, because you got excited, or you have a lot of wet dreams. yes, i know it's tempting, and have minimal movement during (have the person give oral

5) Give yourself small challenges to work your brain. maybe you want to make a sculpture out of marble. look up the actual tools used to sculpt marble, and be pretty good. these small challenges keep dreams interesting, and can really give you  a sense of purpose in a dream that can help keep you dreaming.

6) Not all dreams will be lucid. if you start Lucid Dreaming, change in diet, change in stress levels, or just plain tired, and needing sleep.

7) Fictitious Characters are FICTITIOUS. don't make a dream character, and FEATURE them in your dreams, but don't make them the main object of focus. After all, they are you....

8) Unnecessary killing is just...unnecessary. maybe you are a mighty warrior in your dreams and fight evil. good for you. but, dreams will just start to get to a point where they run together from battle to battle, and murder to murder...

9) applying reality to your dreams can screw you up. Maybe having something take place in the same area you live in isn't so bad, and you stop dreaming.

10) Don't fall in love with a dream lifestyle. it gets to a point where you can actually want to just sleep nonstop. and YES you CAN get addicted to lucid dreaming. it isn't a chemical addiction,False,,t5_2r0f4,False,,,t3_11f1ju

* [Sleep Paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)

* [WBTB](http://lucid.wikia.com/wiki/Wake_Back_To_Bed)

* MILD - see Sidebar

I've been practicing the WILD technique for some months now, feel free to mix and match), and hopefully you can take some of these techniques and apply them as you see fit:

1. Mentally Prepare: As you are getting ready for bed, not hardcore metal or dubstep. I prefer classical: Beethoven or Mozart.

2. Lie Completely Still: This is really tough, try to avoid scratching it. HOWEVER, if you let your mind focus on the itch, it will totally ruin the experience, as the thought will perpetuate yourself. See the [White Bear Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Bear_Principle) If this is the case, scratch the itch, and reset your body's position. Some people report being able to adjust their body without breaking their focus i.e. snapping out of the hypnagogic state. This is not the case for me. Perhaps you are able to do it.   

3. MILD While WILDing: MILD, is the practice of repeating to your self that you will become lucid in a dream. Not only does this technique increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming, but it also keeps your mind from wondering onto other things (things that may or may not be stressful, or require your full brain attention). Alternately, you can practice your breathing, however, try to keep the breathing light, as this typically isn't how the body breathes when you are sleeping

4. (Optional) Get an Eye Mask: I personally try to enter the WILD state while keeping my eyes open (this also takes a tremendous amount of practice). Subsequently, have purchased a sleeping mask. Best 4 dollars spent (in regards to dreaming). This will also increase the likelihood of seeing visual hallucinations brought on by the hypnagogic state. (if that's no your 'thing' then perhaps skip it. But certainly, don't knock it 'till you've tried it.)

5. (Optional) Noise-canceling headphones: I'm somewhat of an self-described audiophile, if you have the opportunity to use them, they will make a boat load of different (especially in a city setting - if you are in the middle of bumbfuck nowhere, then this might not be an issue). Additionally, I listen to a 20 minute long white noise track, that I can upload upon request [its a big file]. Basically, If I make it through the white noise track and manage to stay awake, then tonight wasn't a good night to try to WILD. I might make a point to say that, if you can perceive how much time has past, it usually takes me 20 minutes (for the white noise) and an additional 20-30 minutes before I find myself crossing the hypnagogic threshold into what I call a dreamscape setting

6. This section is more of a rant about the perpetual bad-mouthing of Sleep Paralysis. Sleep Paralysis is NATURAL, I've had experiences where 'loud' noises come from nowhere (just the other night, a blaring fire alarm went off in my mind for no reason), and I've even had the experience of my heart racing ,and the 'pressure' one experiences on the chest for seemingly no reason - this being said, if you are comfortable in the bed you are sleeping in, there is extremely little reason to be terrified of the sights and sounds you might encounter coming exclusively from your mind. Personally, such that my roommates cannot disturb me.

I hope you to-be lucid dreamers can find this thread useful in some respects.

1332935633.0,rhf3i,Tutorial induced lucid dream (funny),gorat,87,9,13,"So I have been going through a dry spell and due to stress IRL my sleep schedule was a bit messed up. Last week I quit smoking and went over the initial paranoia

So I found this subreddit (I was always in DV back in the day) and wrote a couple of tutorials. One for WILDing and one for [Noobs](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/rgpse/my_guide_for_noobs_in_lding_beginner_techniques/) and I spent the last 3-4 hours last night cleaning the house and answering questions in the tutorial. I really primed my subconscious well.

I went to bed and was super-confident I would LD!

I became Lucid looking at my hand (I did a subconscious RC) at some point in my dream. I was really young (maybe 18 or something) and I was a ""virgin"". There was a guy there (which was the real me I think) that was going to help me have my first sex. He summoned a nice girl out of a building and told me to go with her.

We held hands and went up to a balcony overlooking the city and the starry sky. We hugged and looked at the view. An interesting thing I really remember was that the stars in the sky were extremely bright and impressive

So I forgot about sex and was just hugging and looking at the incredible view

After that I kind of lost lucidity (got over-excited) and had a false awakening

ALWAYS CHECK YOUR HAND WHEN YOU AWAKE - ALWAYS!

I didn't do a RC :( and I woke up in my old room in my parents house (haven't lived there for 10 years). Where I ensued to tell my parents I've been LDing but they were assholes (they are really nice IRL) and they were telling me I forgot to go and tell the guy that fixes the doors something etc. (I remembered upon waking that I have to go and make a second key for my door because my parents are visiting from out of town - thanks dream).

After that my alarm clock went off (that I had set for WILDing) and I woke up.

---

So I think that this LD was directly induced by me writing the tutorial and ""guiding"" some LD ""virgins"" towards their first LD. My subconscious appeared like older me

I have been lucid dreaming for years. Every dream I've had in the past two or three years (that I remember, completely naive approach could be a refreshing alternative to those who may have trouble with the methods of this subreddit; as we all know, different things work for different people.

My first lucid experiences were with nightmares. I'm sure everyone's had some sort of terrifying dream where you eventually wake yourself up intentionally out of fear. Since you're aware that you're dreaming

Eventually, after a few nightmares where I would wake myself up, to remain calm in that situation and try and think myself out of it. So in my dream, I closed my eyes, and thought of something else. Something simple, like my room. When I opened my eyes, I was in my room. I got excited and woke up accidentally. Oh well. I had proved to myself that I could do anything I wanted.

From there, the methods are probably much easier than simply going through dozens of rough quality lucid dreams like I did.

So I guess my best insight to provide is that **YOU** have total control over your dreams. Stay calm and try not to get emotional when you're dreaming, you'll wake up. So keep calm, know that you've got everything under control, and you'll have fun lucid dreaming!",,False,,False,t3_1b5i1u

I set an alarm for 6 hours after I went to sleep. When it went off I took 8mg Galantamine and 300mg CDP choline. It was sort of hard falling back to sleep because reality itself was fairly vivid (the sounds of cars passing by were FAR more noticeable than usual). I suppose in reality it was a combo of the chemicals and WILD since I was up for maybe 15 minutes

When I did manage to fall asleep I was treated to 3 lucid dreams. Each more magical than the last (I was woken up briefly in between each)

1) I was in the past, and that Zac Efron was never my classmate.

- My alarm went off.

2) I was on a beach. Very vivid detail in general. I outright knew I was dreaming. I did a finger count reality check and my hands warped like crazy. Fingers added and lost

- The dream dissolved when I tried to fly and I woke up briefly.

3) This was in war ridden 1940's Europe. The entire dream was focused around trying to fly. I had to continuously rub my hands together and look at them while I was slowly rising up. Something about the flying thing makes the dream want to dissolve really quickly. I probably need to spend more time stabilizing before I attempt anything crazy.

The second two were very vivid. Almost magical. I can only describe it as what I imagine heaven would be like.

1366750744.0,1cymrw,I had a breakthrough last night. [Long],callyfree,99,26,27,"This is copy and pasted from a google doc vomit/writing session I had this morning

----------------------

Last night I had a breakthrough dream. I went to bed without any intentions besides getting some rest. I began dreaming, so I was happy to have this moment. This all stemmed from the Ted Talks I saw about confronting your greatest fears in dreams with love, so I thought I would practice it ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1i6A7t6L2g ). So in this moment of discomfort and lucidity, I dreamt up a hoard of monsters crowded in the facade of a building; it resembled a little like the lincoln memorial, except there was no lincoln. I felt a twang of fear at first in confronting these monsters. But I jumped in there with love and started hugging as many as I could and sincerely gave them my affection. And they reciprocated with love too. It was really a jovial moment with truly happy feelings to be around them. 


And then the most amazing thing happened. I felt myself beginning to evolve. Not just in my dream


And then I was transported. I was catapaulted into the universe. I’m not sure if I was astral projecting or just visualizing this unexplored part of our psyche - I say ""our"" psyche because it felt like it didn’t belong to me. It was the cosmos and belonged to no one and everyone. It was probably both. And it was so peculiar because even though I don’t remember this happening


I flew through light years of cosmos and saw stars


Eventually I came to an energy portal. It was a giant beam of energy. There were patterns inside of the beam. It’s hard to describe the shapes of the patterns


And then I arrived in this magnificent purple-pink cloud space. It felt primally feminine and vast with an infinite array of purple and pink fluff. It was the most magical experience to be able to feel the wind against my skin blowing upon me from all directions. I felt this on the skin of my physical body. And somewhere in my flight, so took control and began to explore. 


The space was initially disorienting. There was no up or down or sense of direction. Only me floating and flying around in this vast purple-pink cloud space. There was no sky to contrast the clouds


My initial astonishment began to fade, there was something left to be desired. I felt somewhat smothered. I wanted to be where the light was. I wanted to see and be in the blue sky, not contained in this pink womb space. So I flew and explored looking for something else, probably the sky. Eventually I found it. Or rather, I almost found it. I saw hues of blue and rays of light in the breaks of the purple pink clouds, and this excited me. I began to fly in that direction. 


But my corporal curiosities got the better of me. I wanted to see if I could really see this with my physical eyes instead of my mental ones. So I slowly began opening my left eye. And in this moment of inbetweening I’m still not sure if I was able to or not. But the interjection of my physical body began to unravel my connection with this cloud space. I felt this happening so I closed my physical eye and tried to get back into it. But I was already falling back down through the beam that brought me in. But I didn’t want to leave yet. So I relaxed my spirit again and felt some of the energy swell and release through my body. And for a moment I stayed there in this honeycomb coral beam. I felt uplifted momentarily. Maybe I could get back inside. But I don’t know if I did. Because that’s all that I can remember.",,t5_2r0f4,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1cymrw/i_had_a_breakthrough_last_night_long/

First of all - you remembered to do a RC while in a dream? That's great! Congrats

1. Keep your RC simple. If you try to do complicated things such as trying to fly or passing through walls before you're familiar with lucid dreaming - you'll probably fail since these actions should only be attempted after you're sure it is a dream because they require more visualizing. You need to concentrate in order to do these activities. Try to read something instead. Anything accessible will do - looking at a clock

2. Expectation. Whenever you try a RC, guess what? it will show 10:00 am. Always try to change something that shouldn't change in reality, and if it does change: it's a dream!

Do this

So I've always had very good dream recall ever since I was a kid. I can vividly describe most of my dreams several hours after I wake up before they fade. I've always been able to do that. Lucidity isn't really new to me either. I become naturally lucid in dreams if I had to guess I'd say 4 to 5 times a year. But I never actually tried to change the dream. I've always had a sudden thought like ""Woah


How I generally become lucid is this; I am a very logical person by nature and at times when the internal consistencies in a dream seem too strange I suddenly realize the only logical explanation for the happenings in the dream are that I am in fact dreaming (I hope that makes sense).


Here's an example: The most common time I lucidly dream is during those dreams where you are like randomly naked. Everybody has those right? You're at school or at you're job in the nude and all embarrassed. Well when I have these dreams, why aren't people having a normal reaction to this, you know, outrage and shock?' and then I realize I must be dreaming.


Well today I became lucid three times in one nap!! In the first dream (regular old stress dream) I realized I was an hour late for something I had promised to do and had to rush to get there. There were all sorts of ridiculous obstacles and I couldn't seem to make it to the location. I'd fall asleep and end back up at my house, I drive here every day almost and it takes 15 minutes. It's been like 2 hours now, this can't be real' and that's when I became lucid to the dream.


But instead of just continuing on in the dream I decided 'hey if this is a dream lets try and do something' That thought alone is a totally novel one for me and was a huge step. So I tried to throw the blue mini van in front of me into the air (cause go big or go home). The car started to shake and move and the dark haired woman driving it began to scream hysterically and then I immediately woke up. Had some SP too.


Still had two hours of time to sleep so went back to sleep and this time I don't remember what made me lucid (dream is beginning to fade


Still had like 30 minutes before I had to get ready for work so I went back to sleep. I started dreaming about a phone call. This was a very unformed dream


I think this was a huge step for me. So in summary.


tl;dr: I had control in my lucid dreams for the first time. And I wanted to thank you guys for inspiring me to try it.",,t5_2r0f4,1341752768.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/w7wqq/first_time_in_control_of_my_actions_in_a_dream/

The third dream transitioned into existence with barely a thought to what had happened, as my dreams usually go. In reality, I work construction and in this dream that's where I was, at least what it felt like. Work. At work I run RC's every 15 minutes if I can and I believe the plot of this dream to be a huge factor in my lucidity. I was walking atop a scaffold highrise, some 10-15 ft off the ground. Before me lay what seemed to be the erecting of some sort of stadium with large concrete or stone pillars that loomed high in the sky. As I was walking through a small group of people (I'm guessing fellow workers as I really payed them no mind), I ran a reality check. I have a capital ""A"" written on my left hand in sharpie and in my dream it failed to appear. I ran another RC and again it failed to appear. The moment realization occurred, physical and mental. Like I have read, closed my eyes, for I was to live in this moment more than any other moment that preceded me. As I tried to fly

I must have interrupted my REM of course, and think I had 2 or 3 dreams just in that time. One of them, however, was a false awakening, and this got me into the lucid dreaming mindset. Once I fell back asleep and set my alarm for more time is when I finally reached lucidity.

I woke up in my childhood home, but she was followed by another copy of herself. This tipped me off very quickly, but probably because of the false awakening before. From there on I was able to maintain over myself, but was powerless to control where events took me, simply adapting to the story as the scenes changed. Eventually it came to a party at my old house, and this was where I felt I had the most control up to that point. There was a particular girl there, and I decided to see how far a dream could go. We made out and started going further

The last time I fell asleep, I was actually in the place I had been sleeping, so it took me longer to figure it out. But then I walked to the balcony, looked back on the barstools, and saw my dog, my cat, and my dog again. The double instance of my dog tipped me off, but altogether I had an incredible sleep

It all began when I was young (Currently 20), but they did anyway saying that there was nothing wrong.  They then proceeded to put the magic powder on all of my stuffed animals and toys, giving them life.  After that, it was a fun dream for awhile, until all of the toys slowly started to change into blue skeletons and proceeding to chase me around the neighborhood, jumping me, and waking me up.

Now, because all my Lucid Dreaming began when that same dream randomly recurred to be in my early middle school years.  Once the dream came to the part were all the blue skeletons jumped me, I remembered that this was just a dream and had all the skeletons changed back into toys in an instant.  After that dream, I could tell just about every dream I had was a dream and began having lots of Lucid Dreams.

Now, which I believe lead me to become very suspicious of my own dreams.  I began doing a lot of reality checks in dream, and being I was in school most of the time, so was I in my dreams.  So a lot of my reality checks were just to break a school rule, and in a dream no one would care.  But the biggest thing that gave me the suspicion of being in a dream is that in every dream I have, the gravity is slightly off, being a little lighter than in reality.  That was, my dream sign

So anyway, having recently been informed of Lucid Dreaming, and realizing I had been doing this for most of my life. I do consider my self quite experienced, having gone through several MILDs and a few WILDs, which I will later have detailed posts about, as well as some very interesting semi-Lucid to very Lucid Dreams I think someone might enjoy.

""Am I dreaming?""

""No way man. You alright?"".

""Yeah... somethings just off...""

 We were in a van on the way to a huge graduation party. When we arrived, hopped and tried to fly away. I open my eyes to confused looks and a heaping of awkwardness. As we walk towards the backyard, I hold my nose shut and take a deep breath... I'm breathing. I turn to my friends,

""Told ya""

I hop into the air and lay on my back like I'm doing a lazy backstroke. I slowly drift away from them to the tune of many surprised looks. I try to take off in my usual supersonic flight to find out I can only ""Peter Pan"" my way around. Not the usual Superman stuff I'm used to. That's when I remembered I had smoked.

About a year ago from now, and the next morning I remembered having a very vivid dream. Naturally, I did not really think of my dreaming as resulting from the fish oil. For whatever reason, I kept taking the fish oil before I went to bed, and kept having vivid dreams. I became aware of the correlation, but could not explain to myself (or anyone else) the causation. Furthermore I was able to develop my lucid dreaming skills much more proficiently. But... I wasn't about to tell other people to pop pills before they went to sleep to lucidly dream (at least at that time...).

A few months ago, published articles, etc. So, I eventually shrugged off the correlation as I could not prove it. 

About a week ago, and bam I start vividly dreaming at night with a 100% correlation between taking the fish oil before I sleep and lucidly dreaming. Now I can't let this go. Which is why I am here writing this. Looking at some websites (unfortunately none of them especially credible), some people have claimed that the fish oil helps in dream vividness and recall. I found this interesting, but yet again there does not seem to be any real study on the subject (or at least I have not found it).

I highly recommend trying this for those who are interested in vivid or lucid dreaming. I'm also very curious if anyone else has had this experience

Kelsie opened up to me about a really shitty relationship that she had that lasted five weeks

 I felt a very connected to her. Quite attracted really. We then continued inside together and she chatted to some people behind the bar and started her working shift? I thought this was her party? Obviously not.

 I continued around the bar looking for some people I knew, Ben who introduces me to a couple of friends I know from way back in high school.
 I need to go to the toilet

He agrees

I am overjoyed and comment how he could be my twin and if he actually is me.

He looks perplexed and tells me that he is actually me. As if I should not even be questioning the fact.

Suddenly a whole story clicks into my memory

I notice that the voice of my other self is a lot deeper then I assumed my own was and that my complexion a lot smoother
I put my arm around his shoulder and drag him away from his group of friends without even noticing them. I think I assumed he was by himself. We both walk back to where ben was sitting with the old high school friends. Introducing him as my time travel brother I pull him out a seat next for myself and I

I had a feeling that these people at the table embodied all the people that surround me in my life in my current situation. I never really liked the high school friends at the table and held little respect for them in general. The feeling I felt about the friends at the table

Quickly hurrying back I find that no one was talking to each other, my so called friends not at all impressed that there was two of me. If anything annoyed by it. 

Dragging him away from the emotionally draining situation, covered in drinks and filled with laughing, positive feeling people. 
He introduces me to a girl who hugs me warmly

It clicks. 

All the people around the table and my other self
I had an urge to impress them. All night I had that urge to impress people. Impressing my other self seemed of top priority. I was a little frustrated because he seemed so blasé about meeting me. 

The conversation continued on between all of us. I began to come upon the realization that my other self was just me if I acted more like the person I really wanted to be deep down. At some point he had taken a different path in his life and was actually a completely different person. He seemed disappointed in me, telling me to drink more goon(Australian cheap wine) and slide down hills on mattresses. 

Have more fun.
Make more friends. 
Be a kinder

 He seemed to have an insight into me. Well of course... he was me... I rebutted saying how much I have already accomplished in my life, you have done some great things. To other people, they are amazing things. Is that the best you can do though? Look where you are tonight. Look where I am. Who is in a better position? You’re surrounded by old friends you have nothing in common with. I am surrounded by a group of friends I am sharing life with. I am enjoying, I am laughing, I am happy. Is what  his look told me. Finally with absolute clarity, from the laughter lines around his eyes to each and freckle. The glint in his eyes and the hap hazard posture of confidence and self comfort. It came crashing upon me the fact that. I was not. I was not happy indeed.

Do something about it he whispered.

He wasn’t criticizing me, as I was sitting there, on what I remember to be a chair shorter than all the others, I aspired to be like him(myself) and have friends like him. In hindsight, he kept taking on a persona of an old friend I don't have much contact with now days. I’m not completely sure why.

I woke up with these quotes in my head that I knew I had read somewhere. 

“Man is only truly great when he acts from his passions.”

“The ultimate is not to win

I am still unsure whether this man, an alternate present, or the future. Does it matter though? I feel the message was sent fairly clear. After waking from the dream though, he has inspired me. Inspired me to not just float through life but to actually ""Live"". Live it with aspirations that if I ever do meet myself in a dream again. We will be sitting on a chair of equal height. That he will smile at me and nod. A gesture that he accepts who I am.

One should not live his life trying to be accepted by others, live it so that you are accepted by yourself. Live it, so that if you were to ever meet yourself, you would be proud of them.

Truly I have never woken up with such a weight lifted off me and such a feeling of well-being. Give me more dreams like that!

I'm a dream enthusiast and I've been lucid dreaming for a year. It's amazing stuff

Over the year I've read tons of articles on this subject. Our abilities in our dreams are limited by our imaginations. When we are born, you learn all sorts of rules and ""impossibles,"" which you incorporate into your dream world.

This sucks because we're making our dream world a copy of our waking world, so that I can gain more control and break free from the rules I've subconsciously set for myself. Here are some things I always try, and have tons of fun when I actually manage it:

- Harry Potter
 - MAGIC! Find a wand (a stick or any long thing that resembles a wand) and flick it around
 - FLYING! Find a broomstick
 - ""apparating""
- Avatar
 - Water bending! This is the easiest for me. I can also freeze water now and make rain swirl over my head. Try freezing the surface of a pond and then go skating. I think water will be the easiest for everyone because it is a visible substance and we can move water easily in reality.
 - Fire bending. Start small. Focus on your palm and try to make a fireball appear first
 - Earth bending. I haven't been able to do this yet
 - Air bending. You can knock people/things back
- Dragonball
 - Shoot energy balls!!
 - Fly!!! Try flying on a nimbus too.
 - power up!

Dreams are easier to control if you believe in it wholeheartedly. My little brother
 
The things I listed above are the things I believe in! If you like some other fandom

Also, remember how Gohan taught Pan how to fly!

Some generic things to try are:

- flying
- sex
- teleporting
- mind controlling people. I never tried this, even if I don't see any fire in my dream.
- telekinesis...focus on an object to try to move it
- meet the deceased. Always nice to see your dead relatives/friends
- talk to your subconsciousness. Conjure up something that represents who you are
- Meet living people of course! I'm long distance with my SO so I try to meet him in my lucid dreams =) The hugs sometimes feel very real!

1369416613.0,1ezd7s,Wasn't even trying to and had 3 consecutive lucid dreams last night! These were also my first lucid dreams ever. Blew my mind!,GlumKantaloupe,99,32,11,"I finally know what all the hubbub is about. This lucid dreaming stuff is incredible! It is an experience unlike any other

Anyway, used the bathroom, etc. and about an hour later I decided to lay back down and make up the lost hours. I dozed off very fast and was straight into a dream, one that was not lucid. Some odd things happened in this dream but eventually that dream sequence ended.

I was then shot into a **second dream** with similar characters but a different scenario. Odd things happen again with the same characters, I know =P lol) and got too excited and woke up. Oddly enough, I was trying to have sex with my *girlfriend* in the dream, someone I have sex with all the time, but the dream just made it that much more exciting! Probably because I imagined all the things that would be possible in the dream world...

Okay, stabilize. This dream lasted about 3 - 5 minutes as well. Nothing really eventful, just some exploring (which was still AMAZINGLY cool for my first time!)

The **fourth dream** -- my third lucid -- was the most interesting. It happened to last the longest as well, and this dream was incredibly vivid. I am going to post my entry from my dream journal on my phone. Please mind some of the spelling and grammar, as I use Siri for my entries. It was so damn cool for me!

&gt;I am in my house kind of just walking around. Nothing really prompts me to do a reality check, and take a moment to take in the dream. I look around my living room and it's so vivid and it looks exactly like my living room in real life. It's very bright inside, probably the middle of the day. I decide to walk outside on my porch but the moment I do, it becomes rainy and gloomy but not necessarily dark. It is so detailed I see all the rain droplets, the clouds in the sky, and the lake and pool space in its entirety.

&gt;Being outside, instead of contacting it hard, I fall through it and make a splashing sound. The pavement was water. I fall through it straight to an exact position in the air where I was before and landed on my feet. (Felt like something that would happen if you could travel through mirrors like at the end of *Mirrors* with Kiefer Sutherland.) I keep trying to fly to no avail and was just jumping high. I try to jump onto my roof but am not able to. As I try all of this, my mom comes out and notices that I am trying to fly and tries to fly as well. She is not able to do it either (Interacting with dream family members is weird by the way). I then grab this bright red pool sifting device on the ground and try to use it as a broom thinking that maybe the dream would interpret that and let me fly like a wizard, but nothing happens. 

&gt;After I fail at flying, but still tries to chase me with the speed that the witches do in Left For Dead. I notice she is in a bikini and realize she is quite attractive. I decide to try and make things sexual and attempt to seduce her. After a while of trying, and failing, I end up waking myself.

&gt;AWESOME SHIT MAN!

I didn't try to use any method in particular

Sorry if all this comes off as rambling. It is just very exciting and I can't wait to have more lucid dreams!

First of all, a lot of them I can control but on occasions when I can't the characters in my dreams tell me I can't change the scene because there is something important I'm supposed to learn from it.  Usually I'm fairly good at interpreting my dreams in those cases, what things in my life that may have cause the dreams.  Last night however I experienced the most horrifying nightmare I've ever had in my life, I couldn't go back to sleep after waking up at 3:30 in the morning, and I don't know what to make of it. 

So I was falling asleep when suddenly I became horribly aware that while my body was falling asleep my mind was still awake and alert.  In the darkness of my room is felt something move toward me, but I was powerless to stop it, it climbed into bed with me and  got on top of me.  It was a male figure, while it was to dark to distinguish, it had the build of my boyfriend.  I wanted it to just be my boyfriend, so I said his name and he whispered ""mhhm"" in my ear before starting to kiss my neck and fondle me.  But as much as I wanted it, I knew it wasn't my boyfriend, and more than anything I knew I didn't want to see it. Suddenly it crawled off of me

Climbing out of bed was hard my legs felt heavy and slow, laughing at me.  I was terrified but tried to remain as calm as possible, still calling it by my boyfriends name, allowing it to think it was deceiving me, but in my mind I was angry that this hideous thing was taking the form of a person I love.  I was trying to get to the light I wanted to see it and face it, I was about to flip the switch when it attacked me, it wouldn't allow me to turn on any lights. I fought and struggled with it.  It hissed at me, and the thing was gone.

I jumped up and ran down the hall to my grandparents room, some of the words were barely whispers and I knew then I was still trapped in my nightmare.  As soon as I realized this my grandmother sat up and smiled at me, but of course it wasn't my grandmother, it was the thing in my room that was pretending to be my boyfriend.  I prepared myself to fight it again, I began to pray, suddenly I could see the demon more clearly, it looked like a mix between some kind of hoofed animal and a rotting human corpse.  I realized I had seen this thing before, at that time however it had failed to scare, cause I don't have time for this shit"" it crawled away and that was the end of that dream.  I informed the demon that it would be just as powerless this time to hurt me, never backing away

My grandmother disappeared, he was beautiful.  Somehow I knew it was almost over that I would wake up soon. So I got into bed with it and asked if he wanted to have sex, he said yes, and I had sex with it calling it grandpa (in real life I call my grandfather papa) I didn't actually want to be doing this I just wanted to kill time before I woke up, and I'd rather have a weird sex dream than a terrifying nightmare.  But I couldn't feel anything while it was having sex with me and it only lasted a minute before the thing came and got tired and collapsed next to me, I tried to get it to do it again but it got angry and suspicious with what I was doing and turned back into the monster it really was. I began to pray again as it closed in on me, I prayed loudly with a conviction, then the vomit turned to water, holy water bitch!"" then I kept spraying it till it was gone.  I walked back to my own room closed the door and climbed into bed.  As soon as I closed my eyes I woke up for real.

That's when I opened my eyes. I'm used to seeing things by now when I open my eyes, hanging towel, etc.).  This time was different however.  When I opened my eyes I was in a completely different room, no moving objects or weird shadows or noises; the ringing in my head stopped and my body felt completely awake.  I felt normally awake.

The music had gone away completely and it was just a quiet like on a summer night.  This freaked me out a bit but what freaked me out more was the fact that I didn't wake up from the shock of it.

Not only this, but everything was beautiful and my feelings were of euphoria. Is this common of LDs?

2) Can you ever really attain full control? For example: can I say that I want to go to Disney World and ride the roller-coasters and hope for this to really happen in my dream?

I know there are ""techniques"" to lucid dreaming that have already been explained and talked about to death.


This is a bit different.


It doesn't require practice or anything of that nature


Courage.


The story of the dream:  I was at a gas station filling up my car at the pump.  I accidentally dropped the gas cap and it rolled under the car.  I got down on my stomach and managed to fit my entire body underneath the car to try to get this gas cap.  Now here is the terrifying part...  I went to slide OUT from underneath the car, body trembling, everything was going all ""fight or flight"" on me.  This was truly a nightmare for me because the last thing I would ever want is a slow death by being stuck or by asphyxiation.  


Here's one of the two places where I could have woken up:


If I continued to panic I would eventually get worked up to the point where I would wake up.  I would have that sense of relief


Here's what happened instead:


I begin to calm down and accept the fact that this is the worst thing that has ever happened... easier said than done.  I slowed my breathing


Just like that... completely stuck


This is the second time I could have woken up:


This is where people usually wake up as well.  Some wake up because they are excited


Here is where courage comes into play:


I thought back to when I was stuck under the car.  How trapped and scared I felt.  I tried replicate that state of mind where being calm solved my problems.  It did.  I began to accept the lucid dream and tell myself it's okay that I'm actually laying in bed asleep.  From there on I had a great time... yada yada yada everyone has heard those stories before.  


The secret for me was courage.  I did something that went against my instincts and it caught my subconscious off-guard.  It is not something that can be practiced


I hope this helps!  Stay courageous fellow oneironauts!





**TL;DR**: The secret to having a lucid dream is having the courage to stand up to your fears.  By doing this it disrupts the normal timeline of dreams and sparks a realization that you are in a dream.  From there you must remain calm and not try to wake up out of being excited/fearful.

I started lucid dreaming when I was a teenager. I guess I would be considered a natural, then by the time I was in collage I was lucid dreaming every day. I attributed it to my unusual sleep patterns. 

Then suddenly when I was about 25, after a while my dream recall became very poor, and it felt like my dreams were very few and far between. 

Suddenly about a month ago, but it was during a nightmare and I just aborted the dream and woke up. Then last night it finally happened. I was dreaming I was at a party and borrowed someone's phone. As soon as I was finished with the phone and was about to return it, I had the realization that I was dreaming. So what did I do? After a 5 year dry spell I felt like fuckin flying. I was lucid for what felt like 15 minutes, flying through the air, feeling the wind in my face. I think I could have gone longer, but my dog woke me up.  I can't wait until my next one.

If Lucid Dreaming was a lock, then Awareness is be the key to open it.

Take the time to read through both of those... I guarantee you that you will notice results...


Also

Keeping a Dream Journal is a complete MUST. No 'buts'. Seriously. What's the point of getting Lucid if you can't even remember you did? If you think that's impossible

Get lots of sleep! Over 8 hours is pretty much the minimum, when my REM was at it's peak. 

(Optional) If you really want to remember your dreams.. Before you go to bed, to this... Write down absolutely everything you can remember... Your thoughts, your feelings, anything and everything! This will most likely drastically boost your dream recall that night. If it doesn't, try doing it for 2 nights more, and its nearly a 100% guarantee it will work!

That's pretty much all that I can think of right now... I really hope you guys take the time to read through the links.. At least read through the reality check one! I NEVER do this, and so that they can start getting more Lucid Dreams!!! :D

This is pretty much an outpouring of a lot of the stuff that I know... Use it wisely...

1339985368.0,v7d4r,Amazing dream I had last night. ,raznog,73,17,17,"I started the dream lucid which was cool. The basic premise was I was a Pokemon trainer who had a charizard. There was an evil group trying to destroy all Pokemon then replace them with robot Pokemon. Me and some guy who had a blastoise were fighting against them. 

It started with the blastoise kids parents trying to get him to trade his in for a robot one. Which was unusually emotional. Due to the fact he had it since a squirtle as a child. There was a brief flashback at this point to him growing up with the squirtle. 

After that we left home and went into hiding because the government turned against all trainers. The most memorable part was flying on the back of my charizard while fighting giant mech Pokemon. 

I awoke before we were able to win the war. I can't get over how amazing it was. The dream was so epically vivid

And that basically sums up the most badass Lucid dream I've had to date. Needless to say from now on when I am lucid I'll be reaching for the pokeball on my belt.

There were picnic tables and people hanging out, there was no audio at all in the dream that i recall. 

I decided to see if i could do anything cool, then I jumped way off the roof out into the sky over the lake. Thats all i remember, i lost lucidity and recollection after that.

Basically, I have always known I am dreaming when I am asleep. Be it a long night's sleep or the short day dream of a catnap, I am always conscious of the fact that I am in the dream world. I almost always remember my dreams. I always have limited control of the dreams, but I can affect what's happening in the dream on some nights more than others. I don't usually have the ability to pick the topic of my dream right off the bat though. The best way I can describe it is like playing a really interactive video game, or watching a movie that I am able to make directorial changes to in the middle of the story. Here's a list of things I can always do in any dream:

* Wake myself up

* Have all the same senses I do IRL

* I don't fly very often

* Rewind and watch a ""scene"" over again

* Cut characters I don't like and bring new ones in

* I can either watch the dream in third person or experience from the eyes of myself as a character in the dream. I can switch from one character to another so I can watch the dream from the eyes of others. 

* There are ""sets"" or certain places that I revisits often

I also talk, cry, etc in my sleep and I move a lot as well, mimicking walking, fighting, dancing, or sometimes my body just shakes a lot. So I am wondering if anyone can tell me what level of progress I am at in the lucid dreaming world. 


I would like to learn how to have more control. I don't feel like I can always access my full catalog of choices of what I want to do in a dream or where I want to go. For instance, tonight we're going to ancient Egypt and we will be having dinner with Oscar Wilde."" I would also like to be able to be more aware of experiencing my subconcious.

***What is Sleep Paralysis(SP)?***

Sleep paralysis is the physical state of the human body when it falls asleep. There's nothing too magical about this other than the fact that it stops you walking around when you have dreams

***How can I induce it?***

Inducing sleep paralysis sounds like a very hard thing to do

There are a few signs to look out for/ignore when inducing SP

* Itching - This can be a bitch to overcome. On some nights I personally fell like I have a rash that's spread all over my body just begging me to itch it. Sorry for the details

* Swallowing - This impulse isn't that hard to overcome. Sleeping people can swallow reflexively without thinking

*  (Reverse) Blinking - Now, but when awake some people get the urge to open their eyes for a brief second and close them again. This one isn't too hard to overcome as all it takes is the ability of closing your eyes harder then usual, but not hard enough for it to keep you awake.

I would list off more

***Ignoring the signs***

This step involves willpower

***Recognising SP***

SP can be different for everyone

You ever had the feeling that you were on a fair-ground ride while you were lying in your bed? That's one of the early stages of sleep paralysis. This is your body adjusting to sleeping and can send false messages back to your brain. It's pretty weird at first

It's around this point you should start to see some hypnagogic images, so do a good job of it.

After the initial 'fairground-effect', DON'T THINK OF SCARY DEMONS - THEY DO NOT EXIST. They only appear if you expect them to. Remember, you are the one in control while you WILD, not the other way around!

It's around here that most people eventually start to lucid dream after a few minutes of visualising

'Ever since I could remember I used to get completely disoriented (I felt like I was spinning and floating in space

I used to wake up/move around to re-orient myself. But last night, like it was rearranging itself. Then the visuals came. I let them play and tried following different 'pixels' with my minds eye, when suddenly it all unified and started rotating. Then sound kicked in - a chopper passes overhead. I was looking up at it as it flew over me. I look forward, I'm standing in a jungle. My heart jumped and I'm back in my bed. A few more minutes of trying to SP and this time the pixels swept away as I felt a wind on the side of my face, I'm standing in a desert at dawn. My heart jumps again, and I'm awake.'

***Tools to use***

There are a few different tools and sounds that you can use to help induce an LD

[Gamma Binaural Sound](http://jetcityorange.com/binaural-beats/gamma-10min.mp3) - This is my personal favourite out of pretty much all the LD aids and tools I could find. Right click on the player and then click 'save video as', one in each ear. The binaural beat is defined as the difference between the two pitches. For example, if you hear a 200Hz sound in one ear and a 190Hz sound in the other you’ll hear a 10Hz binaural beat because 200 - 190 = 10. You require stereo sound ear-buds/headphones in order for it to work though, and a pair that you wouldn't mind sleeping in as well. Setting this to loop while falling asleep is the best way to go for it.

In the backround I can see a few of the older heads cocking back their weapons and getting ready to murder me. My friend got up and stood between me and the gunmen. He was assuring me that nothing was going to happen and asked for them to put away their weapons. He said

It was cold of him to put me on the spot, ""It doesn't matter what you say or what they expect me to do. I'm truly sorry and if you don't want accept my apology, so be it."" 

He put his head down. I guess he was processing what I just said. He finally came to his senses and gave me a hand shake followed by a hug. He apologized to me for acting a fool. One of gangters came up to me and said

He reached out to give me a hand shake

He casually walked away and stood in the shadows watching as I made my decision. Given this ultimatum

I walked outside where a few of them were waiting. They gave me this sinister smile and took out there weapons and started firing. People from the party started running and screaming. They unloaded their whole clip on me, ""I am not god. I am the devil and you passed my test. Welcome to my kingdom."" 

As one of the guys was finished reloading I walked up to him and snapped his neck. The others said ""fuck this"" and took off running. I ran after one of them and folded him like bread

I woke up soon after a bit puzzled by my dream. I wish I didn't become lucid because now I'm unsure what I would of chose when came down to me or my friend. It seemed that my mind was testing my morals

Imagine you have three wooden poles

You take the first pole and stick it into the ground.

You tie the first pole to your second pole with an elastic that is 3 meters long.

From your second pole to your third pole you have a rope that is 1 meter long.

Now, and you have to keep the location of this pole in mind the whole time.

You stick the second pole into the ground 3 meters from the first pole

How far can you move the second pole away from the first pole before the tension in the elastic gets too strong? Try it. The more vivid an image you can imagine

.

I personally made it to 8 meters before my imaginary string became too much of a task for my own imagination to pull. I find this seemingly easy task pretty interesting since I previously assumed I had full control of my own thoughts

After a moment of confusion I RC'd by poking a finger through my hand and realized that I was dreaming. I immediately got out of bed and started rubbing my hands together to stabilize the dream, then I hopped up to begin testing things out.

I flew around for another few minutes then slowly dipped into the lake by accident which dragged me out of lucidity and put me into a deep sleep, I then woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and with a vivid memory of what I had done.

The dream from last night was nothing like that.

I had read that most new LD'ers get too excited, so I spun on the spot. It **literally** felt like I was screwing myself into the world (no other way to explain it).

After that, but no idea what I should do first. Still in my tent, I felt like it was too small so I started force pushing the tent bigger with my hands. It got bigger and bigger till it was as big as a house inside. Then I noticed a door on the wall and proceeded to walk through it.

**Belief**
The mind makes things real, and that the dream is not real. You need to fully believe that everything is possible within your lucid dream, and take it as a fact. Is the earth round? Yes. Will dreams follow your every command? Yes.

**Visualization**
One thing I found myself doing, that is). If you want something to be in the next room, try to visualize it and walk into there.
To accompany visualization, will provide a powerful tool.

**Expectation**
This is similar to belief

**Techniques**
If you have problems

*Use the dream environment to your advantage*. If you want something

Fetch items from out-of-vision. I can summon things as I please, there will be one there. Not looking into containers, but taking what you want, is fairly simple. You could try to feel yourself grabbing what you want in there.

Summon people. The two techniques above have provided useful. If you really can't make people appear on your own, and expecting the person to grab my hand. And off we go, hand-in-hand.

Change scenery. This can be a little bit tricky, though. Or fly there.
The harder way would be to realize that the entire dream world is only a hallucination, and then rebuild a new scene. I havn't been able to pull that off with good results... yet.

4.  Dreams are a great perspective, creating odd scenarios.

5.

While you sleep, about 90 minutes. Here's what happens in that 90 minutes:

Once you fall unconscious (for that is what sleep really is)

Stage 1 of NREM occurs right after you fall asleep, just with their eyes shut, the whole time.

In Stage 2

In Stage 3, but are ordinary and not terribly memorable. All of these stages take about 65 minutes. 

As we leave Stage 3 NREM, there is another 5 minutes of NREM, during which we are incredibly easily awakened (think full bladder, creaky house, or those times where you wonder why the heck you woke up randomly).

So what good is that to us? Well, we want about 4.5-6 hours of sleep completed (read: 3-4 cycles), and to wake up between cycles. Let's assume you go to *sleep* at 10:30 (I italicize sleep because it's not what time you go to bed; you must figure out how long it takes you to go to sleep after you hit the hay). 4.5 hours after that is 3:00 a.m., which gives us 3 cycles - great! We'll set our alarms for 3:00 a.m., wake up, and do a WILD. (Note some people advocate waking up in the MIDDLE of REM to WILD so you can reenter a dream lucid. Usually you can just adjust 15 minutes earlier for this, but YMMV.)

We can take this a step further and work out that, we'll be out at 3:15a.m. and be done with two more cycles at 6:00a.m. If we can wake up between cycles, the feeling of early morning sleepiness can be banished quite easily. (Note you can just add more cycles and get up at 7:30am, for example.) In fact, sometimes shifting your wake-up 15-30 minutes earlier so it lands at the end of a cycle can feel better than sleeping for 30 minutes more and trying to bust out of a cycle.

[Here's an example of my personal REM map with different bed/sleeptimes](http://pastebin.com/EUBftBrb) - I keep this by my bed and can work out when I should set my alarm(s). I'd encourage you to make one; they help lots!

Needless to say, by this point you're practically on the doorstep of a forced dream. So concentrate with all of your might on visualizing yourself in your bed. Visualize your darkened room around you, see the rising and falling of your chest in front of you as you breathe evenly. And then visualize yourself rolling on to your side. Let your 'dream eyes' track across your ceiling and to your wall, bringing into your line of site whatever should be (night stand, etc). Concentrate on the tactile sensation you get on your shoulder and side when you roll over. With a little practice and a little luck, you'll slip into a WILD.

We walked through the castle and I enjoyed jumping through things. I remember seeing a mirror and said let's just jump through it. Not knowing what to expect he was totally game for it. We did and it was dark and I was falling, diving. I covered my head instinctively to protect myself and the darkness became a tunnel. I crawled up and down what felt like a dirt and gravel tunnel and finally entered this chamber space with a bunch of doors. In the center of the chamber was my own heart beating steadily, and behind each door was a room of blood vessels, keeping my unconscious body steadily going while my mind was on adventures. We were both fascinated. They looked and felt like nylon to the touch, not at all slimy but pulsing steadily. I felt my dream self could do anything I wanted in this world and still my heart would beat steadily, reassuring me that i was still lucid dreaming. It was really cool. There was an exit to the outside and there were crazy baboon-like gargoyles along the walls, one looked like my redhead friend. My mom was there too, and when I faltered I could feel him lift me up even though I pulled him down. I got high enough to land on top of one of the castle turrets.

I'm reading an advertisement in the local newspaper about an experiment. 
&gt;One person needed for study of brainwaves

And a telephone number. Because I'm in need of money and meditate daily, and it was clearly not the one I spoke to on the phone. He greets me and says that he will take me to his father. For a moment I wonder how he knew that I was the one who called. We drive to an house in the woods. He leads me to a room. There's only a bed with some medical equipment next to it, and an old radio. He tells me to lie down, connects some electrode pads to my head and leaves. After a minute I hear the voice of the old man over the radio. This time he speaks more gently. We basically perform a guided meditation, I really enjoy it. After (what feels like) an hour or so, the younger man returns and takes me back to the train station. 

This repeats for about 5 times. One time I ask the man in the car what this experiment is all about. He tells me that the old man and his wife

As usual, he became a microscopic amount lighter. Since then I believe a man has a soul. Do you know what Lucid Dreaming is?' I said yes, and that I had a couple lucid dreams myself. 'Good, so you know it is possible. What if I told you that another experiment of mine revealed that a brain, just before it dies, shows the same brain activity as one that dreams? Just before you die, you dream. And when that dream is over, and if that has any effect on your death. Do you understand?' I was terrified. At least, he said. I begin to hear voices and I'm shaking. Then I see a bright light. Dying is quite similar to WILDing, but again I'm able to use the skills I learned while lucid dreaming to control myself. I fly around and enjoy the view. Eventually

This really was one of the most interesting dreams I've ever had. Of course I adjusted some little things

Before reading: I’m a 20 years old male

I don't have a date of when I started dreaming like this. It came as a natural thing at first. In periods where I thought life was a bit depressing  I would lay in bed at night and think of how I wish my life was. So I started dreaming. It sounds so sad, even if you have plenty of friends. It's no wonder that I would feel lonely, since I don't have a girlfriend, and I never had. I just have a hard time getting really close to girls. Anyways, that's the backstory.

It usually starts out when I’m laying in bed, with feelings and emotions. I can do whatever I want and be whoever I want. Next thing I know I wake up in bed and the only thing that remain is an empty, but strong feeling of what was seemed so real. Most of my dreams strive for that feeling of mutual love, which I haven't experienced yet. I can control it pretty well, but I do it only in short periods (maybe 2-3 nights in a row) and then a few months can pass, it varies. 

Dreaming has become a way to access feelings that I wish I would feel in my every day. I'm not sure how healthy it is

I don't believe it will be very difficult

So after some reading of these techniques here I decided to try WILD I believe. I'm not sure if I was doing it right but I lay on my back arms by my sides and legs slightly spread in a natural and comfortable position. I just focused on letting my body sink away

Regardless it didn't take long for something to happen, I would simply refer to it as 'intense terror.' This time it was different though, I knew now that it was sleep paralysis and that it was normal and safe. This however, was by far the most intense sleep paralysis that I have ever experienced. It hit me like a ton of bricks, I had intense auditory and visual hallucinations, my cousin who sleeps in the same room began to scream in a demonic fashion and there were figures all over the room. I tried to tell my brain to calm down and I tried to relax but in the end the intensity brought me back up. 

I felt I was right there about to break out the room into a lucid dream
 
I am going to try again tonight
I believe I can control the sleep paralysis

Tl;dr how do I resist the urge to move









EDIT: a few hours after I wrote the above I tried going for a mid day siesta. I have a day off to mess around so I thought why not? I lay there while my cousin watched tv in the same room, at that point my cousin woke me, he's an annoying bastard so this was inevitable. After telling him to shut it I lay back down and kept still once again, this time it was different though. It must have been because I had already slept for a certain period of time, but I sank straight into sleep. I felt my body paralyze but I didnt experience full blown sleep paralysis, it went past that and then the dream formed. 
Basically I was standing in the room by the bed I was sleeping in, this enforced in me the fact that the dream was shallow. I began to lose some control when I began being 'pushed' backwards and forwards in the room by an invisible force. I didn't fight it but remained as still as possible. After a bit of this I left the room into the hallway, it was also beautifully reconstructed and I began to regain some control over my movement. I slowly raised my arms and put my hands together in front of me,  at this point though, the dream became really weak and the tv got louder. I returned to the first room to try and stabalize it but it was a lost cause, I surfaced to my bed pretty quickly after that..

This was the first time I had closed my eyes and willfully induced a lucid dream, this is the time where I've had most of mine. If you have a day off go to bed late and when you wake, try willfully inducing it. I still have a lot of work to do trying to control and stabilize the dream while I'm in it. It's pretty amazing that you can train these things in your brain, I wonder how far you can take it though, is it possible to control every aspect? Or will some things always be random?

(Please note



1.You may not even get to sp your first, fourth, or even fifth try. It's a lot harder then it looks, im on month 2 and still mastering it, but you may get it in a week or so, it depends on many factors.

2. If you spend more then an hour on one WILD attempt

3. Refrain from using electronics an hour before going to sleep.

4. Naps help, your hallucinations might  get less scary during day time.

5. Always use WBTB before trying to WILD. It else you'll just be wasting your time. Even though it's possible to get an ld without WBTB

8. Be prepared for some really scary hallucinations. It's hard to overcome them, lights) I've had some in the past that made me cry from the sheer beauty of it. I wouldn't expect these though, be prepared for the bad ones.

9. Don't open your eyes during sleep paralysis. Trust me. Seriously. 

10. I've found switching from a bed to a couch halfway in the night helps

11. A lot of rutorials I read didnt point out that when WILDING, I thought an entire night had passed, but only 4 minutes had. ( I came to right at the end of a song)

Now
1. Lay down.
2. Don't move at all
3. You'll start to feel sensations
4. You'll feel like a lead blanket was put over your whole body
5. Here's the hard part. You'll need to clear your mind completely while remaining barely conscious. Your inner voice needs to be gone. This takes a lot of practice
8. You'll need an anchor to pull you out of your trance once you cleared your mind. Music works for this

9. If everything worked, cause you can't move.
10. Focus on the blackness of your minds eye. Might see stuff form before your eyes, false awakenings happen a lot at this point, and they can be extremely realistic, and the transition from awake to dream can be so fast you don't even recall blinking. Do some stabilization techniques and enjoy your lucid dream! Good luck!

Only lasted 5-6 seconds. ,Mauldrich,57,10,17,"I wanted to post my experience because I have seen spatterings of people that have mentioned taking Melatonin and B6 but there wasn't a lot of experiences with it.  So I thought I'd post my findings in case there is anyone else looking for information on the subject.  

To start

Last night

Melatonin - 5mg or 10mg. (I chose 5mg)

B6 - 100mg or 250mg (I chose 100mg)

I chose the lowest in both supplements as I didn't know what, I took one of each.  Not expecting anything, I watched the last 30min of the hockey games before bed.  About 20min after taking the two supplements I could feel the effects of the Melatonin.  I felt very relaxed and had a couple passes of very light dizziness.  Not enough to cause nausea or anything.  Just enough to say, ""It's time for bed.""

Going to bed

Below I will tell you the entire story and then give pros and cons from my experiment. The times I give are guess-timations because I didn't open my eyes to look at the clock.

Ok..  So I go to bed..  I decide to try WILD.  I get comfortable and stayed still.  After about 15-20min, this focused me a bit as I have read that noises were another stage of WILD.  At this point, I started visualizing things.  I had problems though.  Nothing was defined.  Everything I'd see was not quite there.  It was a little frustrating.  Occasionally, a person would pop in and pop out extremely faded.  I tried thinking to myself that I wanted things to get brighter and have more clarity.  It was wavering in and out.  I was continually trying to see my hands but couldn't make them out.  I was hoping to rub them together.  Nothing..  I did get it a little brighter..  But there was nothing to light up at the time.. I started to wander again and then all of a sudden... 

I was standing on a small grassy hill.  I could hear the wind blowing lightly through the trees.  The sky was a deep purple and blue.  Like a storm was on the horizon.  I looked up and there was the biggest zeppelin I have ever seen.  It was metallic looking and I could hear the buzzing on the fan engines on the rear of the aircraft.  It was moving slowly and effortlessly away from me and from left to right.  As soon as I appeared

I woke up in the morning felling normal.  Not really rested.  But not tired.

The point of my post was to give the noticeable differences with taking the Melatonin and B6.  So here they are.

*The 5mg of Melatonin was sufficient to make me sleep.  However

*My initial thoughts of the 100mg of B6 was that it was too much.  I think it prevented me from falling deeper into sleep.  But the positive side was that it kept me focused and aware with little effort the entire time.  In contrast

*Technically, did not get me to an LD.

When I try this again

Anyway

If you panic or are surprised by it then you will collapse it.

Some background: I have a bunch of friends who smoke, awful stuff; please don't start smoking, ever! I finally said, enough is enough, I'm not a smoker and don't want to be one, and picked up some patches from Amazon. I don't smoke anymore except socially with those same friends (I never buy my own, in other words

I left one on when I went to sleep, without trying or even knowing that Lucid Dreaming was a real thing.

Anyway, it ruins the whatever"" but it doesn't).

I'm not a doctor

I've had all sorts of intense dreams this way and I'm not sure if they're completely or technically ""lucid"" but they're much *much* more lucid and vivid than usual. I've had dreams where I've been at parties and did whatever I want.

1332456788.0,r92ym,Lucid Dreaming Toolkit - How to gather material for awesome dreams.,,48,4,41,"After you start lucid dreaming

This thread is meant to teach how to do things you want to in your dreams through experiences IRL. We all know our dream material comes from messed up fragments of real life and experiences that we have. So

That might be a little abstract to understand

I was flying with a jetpack in a dream. While I was flying, I could just jump really high. It's ""impossible"" to fly, so I could not.

In this very same dream, i'd fly riding a flying creature. My first thoughts were a flying dragon. But how could I summon a dragon? It's as possible as flying.

I shouted Odahviing! It's a reference from a game called Skyrim. In the game logic, a flying dragon appears. I mount that dragon, tell him to glue my legs into a saddle he had in his torso, and I could fly while casting lightining bolts (the lightning bolts are from skyrim aswell).

In order to have these kinds of tools, watch movies, and read fantasy books or comic books. 

Now

**Games:**

* Tiberian Sun - *Jetpack units that could fly. Lost power after lucid

* Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War - *High jump jetpacks.*^lucid ^dream

* Skyrim: *Summoning a dragon through a thu'um (magic shout)

* Mirror's Edge: *I could literally climb a really tall building and walk over walls without falling. It's more fun than flying.*^normal ^dream

* Warcraft III and WoW: *Fuck there are a lot of spells there.*^normal ^dream

* Call of Duty

**Movies:**

* Matrix: *Shitload of lucid dreaming material, summoning loads of weapons and kung fu, ninja fighting material. Teleportation aswell.*^normal ^and ^lucid ^dream

* Harry Potter: *Do I need to say anything? To get a wand

* Saving Private Ryan: *Great for war themed dreams.*^normal ^dream

**RPG**

* *This is very particular to the game you are playing. I was able to summon a wolf in a non lucid dream

**Books and Comic Books**

* Out of the Silent Planet: *Good if you want to explore mars!*^normal ^dream

* Harry Potter: *Duh*^normal ^dream

* Sandman: *I once dreamed I WAS sandman

* X-Men: *A superpower buffet.*^normal ^dream

**Anyway**

The more things you have in your mind, teleport to africa, pick one up and teleport back.

*Edit: The superscripts are the way I found out about them

**If anyone have other great LDtools

So, and as someone who has yet to have much success, I thought I would give this a go.

However

And so, could help this old soul with.

1.) Around what time would be best to wake up to perform FILD? I have tried looking this up

2.) How do you deal with racing, I would be uncontrollably preoccupied with pretty much anything else, such as a song or video.

3.) At what tempo should you 'move' your fingers?

4.) What methods have you found to be most effective for calming down? Every time I tried FILD
