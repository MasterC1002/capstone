The current features supported are:

* OBJ models (triangulated or quad based works best
* Up to 3 lights (1 in the free version
* Normal mapping
* Fresnel based Specular (alpha channel is used for roughness currently)
* Emissive textures in pro version
* Wireframe overlay
* Full bright texture display
* Live wallpaper
* Multiple object scenes
* Gallery mode in the pro version

Some of my future plans currently include:

* Replace the colour picker
* Shadows
* Image based lighting
* Glossy reflections
* Velocity based camera (swipe and the camera slowly comes to a stop essentially).

There's still some edge case bugs with loading that need to be resolved still so feedback is welcome.

Yesterday I wanted to create a normal map for a very low poly object and wanted to keep some edges hard. After trying to use the crease border tool I couldn't get the result I wanted; I googled a bit for a better solution and found that after using the crease tool in Maya and GoZ it should keep the edges as I wanted them. The result was still not very good
After that failure, all the functions I wanted and needed were there and seemed easy to use, the interface was well organised and much more intuitive (probably because I'm used to Maya), moving the camera instead of the object was more pleasant, and overall it seems like a great easy to use sculpting software.


That made me wonder why we don't hear much about it. Every time I see something sculpted in 3D


I find Zbrush extremely hard to use

Why is Mudbox so underrepresented

1366646013.0,1cvam2,[Research] Would anyone like to learn more about a production pipeline?,probablydyslexic,22,5,7,"Hi Everyone!

I’m a graduate student at SCAD studying Animation.  I am beginning work on my masters thesis this quarter and I wanted to include you all in my research because I am developing tools and methods primarily for people like you!

My thesis is centered around the collaborative effort of talented people such as yourselves to produce an animated short film or game.

**I intend to research and develop tool-sets and methodologies to aid a group of people to collaborate over the internet to establish a decentralized studio capable of taking a script or idea and seeing it through to completion.**

I will be sharing my findings and research with all the communities I frequent

EDIT: *This will be open platform

The reason I’m posting here is to seek your opinions and gauge your interest.

I have a few very simple questions that would aid me greatly in the development of my thesis.  I’d love it if you could answer them and ask any questions you have for me!

* 1) Would you be interested in collaborating with people over the internet on larger projects?

* 2) Do you currently have experience coordinating

* 3) Would you like to learn?

* 4) Are you a: Hobbyist, or Professional?

* 5) Which artistic school would you closely identify with? Concept/Previs, Animation, Lighting, VSFX, Compositing / Post-Production?  (Or Other)

I also I developed a [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13A9Tfg49kXFVmEv4LiaiopRe4LCwMhgl8w8QO0mmbx8/viewform) intended for people currently in the industry, you have a job in the industry, and want to help further I'd appreciate 10 minutes of your day. :)



Thanks again for any information or discussion that results from this.  Crowd sourcing opinions and discussion is (unfortunately) one of my primary research methods!

I'm currently a dishwasher, and even finding a better crap job seems impossible as of late (I watch as friends that are graduating from RPI now can't even get a job at a deli, and it's very sad).  At the worst, I couldn't afford food and lost a quarter of my weight, though now I can at least live slightly comfortably.  I just want to get out of this, and do professionally what I've come to enjoy so much.

I'm months from starting at the Art Institute's Boston campus, and build online relationships that could get me jobs.  I've tried that on several sites, and it got me nowhere.  Meanwhile, my job takes so much time from me that I can barely find any to actually work on my art... but if I stop working, I'll be bankrupt very quickly.

I never had any training in it, I found it very counter intuitive and hard to work with so I quickly decided to search for a better product and ended up using Maxon Bodypaint. It was pretty good for the time being but when I discovered 3D Coat, I figured I like it even better. I used 3D Coat for a long time to make various textures, although none were too complicated or professional-looking. I also tried painting in Mudbox. I liked some of its features but I went back to 3D coat soon enough becasue it gave me more precision when aligning up images for projection painting.

For some reason I just can't get wacom pressure sensitivity to work correctly in 3D Coat, and considering most game models have mirrored UVs, I quickly gave up on using it for game model texturing.

So few weeks ago I tried what was a new approach for me, since it can be previewed in a matter of seconds. It's certainly a step below 3D texturing applications when it comes to convenience or trying to figure out where exactly something in 3D model will be in the 2D space, it often takes some guessing to make stuff line up correctly.

I'm working on a moba style character texture, I know some people are using it but I don't really know much about it, I just somehow haven't got around to trying it.

Here is some of texture work that I did over time using different applications:

* Maxon Bodypaint
 * [texture](http://i.imgur.com/C1Zog.jpg)
 * [test render](http://i.imgur.com/ipYeS.jpg)
* 3D Coat

 * texture was ptex
 * [test render](http://i.imgur.com/KsZTI.jpg)
* Photoshop and 3Ds Max workflow
 * [early work in progress](http://i.imgur.com/X9Qyb.jpg)

I'm currently making some plans to hopefully land a job in the CG world (same ol' story) and I'd have some questions for those of you guys who went through all the trouble and managed to get through.

First of all, I'm kind of afraid that the fact that I never went through any standard formation system in the industry might lower my odds of being hired. Do companies and studios pay more attention to the fact that you have a substential reel to show or to that you actually went to that one school that gives that diploma?

My second question was more about the work itself. I've been working for about six years mostly on personal projects, Nuke and Max on a daily basis, but I tend to go in every direction, exploring absolutely every aspect of the softwares that I can, some aspects more lightly than others.
Should I focus on one particular skill and leave the others to a minimum? Or should I diversify

The photos are high resolution raws of historic stone. Focusing on large stitch-able sections of walls and doors, perfect for historic cg of castles etc. They are lens corrected but untreated photos, not tiling textures, but a large amount can be stitched together to make large sections of walls/ramparts. The photos are also shot on very overcast/fog days to reduce shadowing, the result is very flat. My feeling from texturing this kind of work in the past, is to the leave the photos un-cropped and un-stiched.

I feel the textures could be useful for any 3d artists wanting to build historic stone buildings. Especially if they live somewhere that lacks in European historic stone walls!   

So.. I was thinking about trying to sell them just as a little sideline. I'm not really interested in selling individual photos on a stock site

But before I do I would really appreciate some input.  

Do you think this is a good idea? Do you think there's a market for the kind of textures I've described?
Do you ever buy or sell texture packs? If so from which sites
Would you appreciate un-cropped photo sets instead of tiling textures?

I would like to supply the highest image quality if needed. Which formats would you find useful to download textures as, .tiff, .exr etc?  
If I was to set up a small website to sell the textures using a paypal file downloady thing

I would like to give good value to freelancers and for personal use but would like to make more money if it was being used by large companies for commercial work
Do you have any advice?

If you [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5_ipWoEpSI&amp;feature=related) from about 1:45 you'll see the view.

It looks like a matter of acquiring off-the-shelf models of a tractor, and skinning and tweaking them to the client's specs; modeling a corn or wheat field and the rest of the environment; and animating the models going through several maneuvers as seen through the left and front windows of the combine.

Hello
  
So I'm a web developer/designer by trade
  
However
  
My questions are as follows:
  
* Cut scenes seen in current games such as the later Metal Gear Solid games, etc. What software is used for the character modeling? What software for the landscape and texture modeling?
  
* How difficult are the learning curves in programs like Maya
  
* Would you recommend any sites where I could get started with tutorials
  
  
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide me with.
  
I know I have delusions of grandeur citing examples like MGS4 and DMC

I'm an mechanical engineer by trade and use SolidWorks heavily.  My world is complex rigid assemblies with 1000+ solid parts.  I find solids to be comfortable and constrained.  I played around with 3ds Max in high school and found it to be a little chaotic.  I really had no idea what I was doing.

Goal: some animation and rigging to start

My problem:  the things I want to create are heavily rooted in mechanical design and are ideal for solid modeling but the solids animation packages I've worked with are pretty limited.

Questions:
Does it make sense to build solid models and then port them over to a different graphics package?

Is this crazy or do people actually do this?

Would imported solids be dumb geometry?

Is there a nice in-between modeling package or a go-between plugin?

Is there an easy way to port my skills to polygon or NURB modeling?

By comparing specs, I have also seen that the NVidia GTX 560 Ti graphics cards are capable of 1263.4 GFLOPS, and have 384 CUDA cores per card, and the GTX 580 = 1581.1 GFLOPS and 512 CUDA cores.

I got a question
So far my workflow for game models is to create high poly, which i use then for the guide for 2D texture painting in photoshop. I was wondering is it possible, and is there any accesible software that would allow me to paint high poly model in 3D, and then projecting it on the low poly model. I think zbrush has this functionality, but not sure how will it work with models completely modeled in other software with subdiv modelling. 

It would make sense to me to do it in zbrush, which im guessign will be an issue while generating a texture in zbrush. And i would really like to avoid unwrapping 2 mil polygon models if i still have to unwrap the low poly anyway.

tl;dr: looking for a software that allows painting high poly models in 3d without necessity of uvwmapping and is able to project it on the uvw coords of low poly version of the same model.

edit: just realised. Will importing high poly model into zbrush without uvw coordinates (which will force zbrush native mozaic like way of uvwmapping(?)) then paint it and then use xnormal function of projecting that ""mozaic"" into proper coordinates?

Just to be clear, convert the quaternion to angle-axis, and use the matrix stack to do the transformations.

Here's my current approach: I'm writing this in Python, y, z) order. I've also got a list `bone_parents` that gives the index of each bone's parent or -1 if the bone is the root. They're stored in order such that a bone never precedes its parent.

In case the notation is unfamiliar: `numpy.cross` and `numpy.dot` compute cross and dot products respectively, a in enumerate(b):` as `for (i = 0; i &lt; b.length; i++) { a = b[i]; .... }`. Without further ado, here's the code:

\*\*\* *REDACTED

So, or relative_angle. What am I doing wrong?

**UPDATE:** I've solved it, for starters) so I switched to a more explicit definition (straight from Wikipedia):

    def quat_multiply(q1
        a1, d1 = q1
        a2, d2 = q2
        return np.array([
            a1 * a2 - b1 * b2 - c1 * c2 - d1 * d2
            a1 * b2 + b1 * a2 + c1 * d2 - d1 * c2
            a1 * c2 - b1 * d2 + c1 * a2 + d1 * b2
            a1 * d2 + b1 * c2 - c1 * b2 + d1 * a2]
        )

    def quat_multiply_conj(a
        b = b.copy()
        b[1:] *= -1
        return quat_multiply(a

    def rotate(q
        return quat_multiply_conj(quat_multiply(q

The second flaw was with the order I was doing things in, the new global rotation was just the multiplication of the previous global with the local quaternion. The more subtle point was that the new global translation is obtained by 
 
 1. starting at the origin
 2. applying the new local translation
 3. *rotating that point* by the old global rotation
 4. adding to this *rotated* version of the local translation to the old global translation.

Here's the corrected code:


    def get_3d_pose(relative_angle
        absolute_angle = relative_angle.copy()
        absolute_trans = numpy.zeros_like(relative_angle)
        absolute_trans[:
        for bone_id
            if parent &gt;= 0:
                absolute_angle[bone_id] = quat_multiply(
                    absolute_angle[parent]
                    absolute_angle[bone_id]
                )
                absolute_trans[bone_id] = rotate(absolute_angle[parent]
                                                 absolute_trans[bone_id])
