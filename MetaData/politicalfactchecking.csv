""...two policies that bear primary blame (for the downturn in th economy that is about to occur) are ObamaCare and the fiscal cliff. Markets and business owners are struggling to prepare for these two gut punches. With the fiscal cliff, particularly small businesses' ability to hire or expand. But ObamaCare is doing much the same thing in a way that will only worsen as tentacles of regulation extend ever further.

There are many more MANDATES in the law besides the infamous individual mandate to buy health insurance. For example,000 per employee if they don't comply. The response is entirely predictable: Businesses avoid hiring that 50th employee and reduce hours for their current employees or pay the penalty, which is often cheaper than insurance, leaving employees on government exchanges.

Darden Restaurants, Longhorn Steakhouse and others, falls into the latter category. The chain announced in October that it would begin limiting employee hours. McDonald's, White Castle and Denny's, among others, are expected to do likewise... John Schnatter, CEO of Papa John's, translating to reduced employee hours and of course higher prices.

&gt; So Republicans are to blame for all those cloture petitions to end filibusters

&gt; On March 19

&gt; Majority Leader Harry Reid bypassed the committee process, he started the process to call up the bill by moving to ""proceed to it"" and immediately filed a cloture petition to end debate on that motion.

&gt; The following Monday, Mr. Reid offered five consecutive amendments and one motion in order to effectively block the consideration of any competing amendments or motions.

&gt; He then filed a cloture motion to close out debate on the bill. Two days later

&gt; Now go back to the Politico story and ask yourself how exactly Republicans filibustered this bill? They didn't have time to filibuster anything

This photo is often used to claim that the filibuster is being used often:

Mods


Section: What is verifiable

Not every question can be verified for a number of reason. Please form all questions in a way that can be answered by a Yes/No answer. For example:

Good Questions: 

* Person X said that he created 5
* Company Y said ""Person X has increased the spending of the government by $5

Bad Questions:

* Person X said that he created jobs
* Company Y said ""Person X spends more than anyone else in history"" Thoughts?
* Is it possible that person X spent more than 5 million on funding?

When posting a question try and keep it so that there is only a single fact to be checked. Asking for an ad to be checked that has 10 questions means that it cannot be answered Yes/No

The state of mind for a person or a company cannot be checked. There is no way for us to know if Company X intentionally misreported something. However we can check if they did misreport something. For example:

Good Question: News station X stated that Person Y created 5million jobs over the 2009 and 2010 calendar years

Bad Question: Did News station X purposefully state that Person Y created 5million jobs in 2009/2010 when he actually created 10million jobs?

The question you ask should make sure to include enough details that you are not misquoting an article. If the question is really long due to a very specific figure being quoted

When asking a question please give a source (or many if you have them) regarding the question.

The Washington Post published [a critique of the Heritage study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/26/how-to-make-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-add-up-sort-of/) claiming that the stepped-up basis estimate was incorrect.

&gt;The $19 billion figure is how less the current system takes in than if all assets were taxed at capital gains rates at death. That’s a much more dramatic change than the one Dubay is proposing

I think this criticism is incorrect and would like to know what others think. Here's what Dubay's study says about eliminating the stepped-up basis rule:

&gt;Plans that properly repeal the death tax typically employ a system

The CBO figure he cites is comparing the current stepped-up basis system to the following:

&gt;Under the baseline tax system
would be taxed when assets are transferred at death or 
by gift.

The only difference I can see between Dubay's proposal and the CBO analysis is that appreciation on property passed at death would not be taxed until the heir sells the property. Imagine I buy property for $10, my heir pays capital gains tax on $20 ten years after my death. Under the CBO analysis, my estate pays capital gains tax on $10 at my death and my heir pays $10 in capital gains when he sells. This would mean slightly less revenue because of time value of money considerations, but I don't think it would be ""much less"" and I don't think these two scenarios are ""dramatically different.""

1374118912.0,1ijb74,10 THINGS THE MEDIA AREN'T TELLING YOU ABOUT THE ZIMMERMAN CASE,Difiggles,30,31,27,"Any of these hold any weight. I'm honestly curious

Link: http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/17/10-Facts-the-media-Arent-telling-you-about-the-zimmerman-case

Text: 1. There is Zero Evidence Race was Involved In the Shooting
Early last year, rather than change course, in order to cover up their mistake, the media put the pedal to the metal in pushing a racial angle.
This crusade
During the trial
The one juror who has spoken out said the jury saw no evidence of a racial motivation.
The media's racial narrative is based on nothing more than partisan lies, and a cynical alchemy conjured from nothing to enflame division and hate.
Moreover
On the contrary…
 
2. Zimmerman's Admirable History of Being Colorblind Toward Blacks
Zimmerman's past indicates he is color blind. He has dated black women, has black relatives, and voted for the first black president.
 
3. Zimmerman is Hispanic
Like President Obama,"" a ""self-described black,"" or a ""white black."" Obama is black. Period.
Zimmerman, because it is inconvenient to the white versus black racial narrative the media are hyping, the media refuse to identify Zimmerman as a Hispanic.
A full fifteen months after the media learned they had made a mistake and that their prey was Hispanic
Those not referring to him as white are either ignoring his racial heritage altogether
As far as I know
Speaking of unprecedented…
 
4. Obama's Justice Department Has Launched a National Fishing Expedition Against Zimmerman
Probably because the reporting of such a frightening and Orwellian act of federal overreach might make look Zimmerman look sympathetic and hurt Obama
In order to build a civil rights case
The federal government crowd-sourcing for evidence against a single American is both chilling and something heretofore unheard of.  
 
5. Like Some Conservatives
One of the false racially-charged talking points some in media are using against conservatives is that we are racist for fearing there might be violence in the wake of the verdict.
Something inconvenient to that narrative is the fact that a black
I know this case has elicited strong passions.  And in the wake of the verdict
Unfortunately for a race-baiting media, has to be ignored in order to serve an artificial narrative.
Which brings me to number six…
 
6. There Has Been Widespread Violence After the Verdict
The fear President Obama and those ""racist"" conservatives shared about the possibility of violence in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict has been vindicated.  
In just a few days
The media are dutifully covering up this widespread violence. Yes
One aspect of this lawless spree the racially-obsessed media adamantly refuse to report on are the reported ""hate crimes"" being committed by black against whites and Hispanics.
Which brings me to…
 
7. Zimmerman Protesters Commit Numerous Racially-Motivated Assaults:
While the irresponsible media is inventing from whole cloth a racial narrative in the Trayvon shooting
Thus far
The same thinking holds true for these reported assaults by blacks against Hispanics and whites. To focus on reality might undermine the fabricated narrative that an innocent black teenager was stalked and murdered by a racist white man.
 
8. ""Stand Your Ground"" Has Nothing to do With the Zimmerman Case
Other than ginning up black turnout for Obama's re-election effort in the crucial swing state of Florida and enflaming racial tensions (which solidifies the Democrat base)
But like the fact that Zimmerman is not white and that there is zero evidence showing race was in any way involved in his actions the night of the shooting
The Zimmerman case was a simple case of self-defense:
The jury received standard instructions. Zimmerman did not invoke the Stand Your Ground provision. Zimmerman later waived his right to a pretrial immunity hearing under the Stand Your Ground procedures.
And as National Review’s Sterling Beard points out
Even the prosecution rejects the cynical attempt to tie Martin’s death to Stand Your Ground. Prosecutor John Guy couldn’t have made it clearer during the trial: “This case is not about standing your ground.” During their post-trial press conference, perhaps, pre the changes in the law.”
Prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda replied: “You know
These facts
 
9. Rachel Jeantel Might Be Responsible for the Deadly Confrontation
An unfortunate mix of marijuana, could go a long towards explaining why a physical altercation occurred:
[CNN's PIERS] MORGAN: And he was freaked out by it [Zimmerman following him]?
JEANTEL: Yes. Definitely after I say may be a rapist, every -- who's not that kind of way, seeing a grown man following them, would they be creep out?
She continued:
""And people need to understand, mind you, I told you -- I told Trayvon it might have been a rapist.""
Evidence that shows why Trayvon might have been the aggressor, bringing the issue of homophobia into the personal narratives of Trayvon and Jeantel just can't be allowed to happen.
This bombshell has been swept under the rug just as effectively as the other nine.
 
10. The Florida Justice System's Leniency Towards Trayvon Led to His Death
In order to make his crime statistics look good
Instead of being arrested and charged after being found with a burglary tool and 13 pieces of jewelry stolen from a house a half-mile from the school
Either of those incidents could have put Trayvon Martin into the custody of the juvenile justice system. However, he might never have been in Sanford the night of his fatal encounter with Zimmerman.
What we have here is a case of police corruption in which the media have shown no interest
But to report this story would mean upsetting the narrative that Trayvon was an innocent (like many of us at 17
--

A lot of people just want to tell themselves they are making things better by doing something. Whether it actually helps doesn't matter because they just want to make themselves feel all warm and fuzzy with a false sense of security and self-righteousness for helping others. And it's not the thought that counts because they are actually lowering everyone's safety by masking the real problem allowing it to get worse while making people more vulnerable because of their ignorance and false sense of safety. Politicians are great at making bubbles via social engineering and this is no different. You can live in your little dream world and pretend that banning guns is going to make you and the world safer, not because they think that the loss of even one individual isn't important but that if we are not careful we will end up with a ""war on guns"" much like the ""war on drugs."" And if you don't know anything about drugs or wars the attempt to combine them has been a disaster and in the long run only increased the demand for drugs. It has turned mom and pop meth trailers into high volume meth industries south of the border and ruined the potential of countless people for smoking weed. And yes weed is illegal so they shouldn't smoke it. But that is also ignorance. Getting drunk and driving and alcoholism are far worse threats to society than someone smoking some pot. How many people does that make a hypocrite. The only superficial statistic you can use to justify harsh penalties for marijuana use is that it is a gateway drug and you have to stop the heavy drug users before they start. Well that is another example of self-righteous warm fuzziness, probably by people that drink regularly. If you had to go to the same circle of people to get your glass of wine as you do to get an 8ball it would not be hard to link wine as a gateway to cocaine. 

People need to start dealing with their/our problems instead of deferring the accountability to the state or to a god. And I use “their/our” in a completely individualistic and selfish context. Raising the standard of living as a hole increases the opportunity for an individual to raise their own standard of living.",self,t5_2uvnw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/1az509/i_hate_to_bring_up_something_so_topical_as_gun/
