I'm not asking about the math itself: there are plenty of good introductions to the subject, [here](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1214458322) (constructing an explicit and—supposedly—simple exotic ℝ^4; requires subscription), or the book *Exotic Smoothness and Physics* by Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans which really explains things from the beginning or again Scorpan's *The Wild World of 4-Manifolds*.

My issue is how you *visualize* the damn things.

Or to say things otherwise, ""topology"" intuitively seems to be the sudy of how manifolds fit together globally, because it contradicts reality.

1374423942.0,1ir7pa,[x-post from r/math] Questions about the Circumference of a circle given a Minkowski metric.,Danistan619,18,0,1,"Hello r/puremathematics

Firstly sorry for the lack of Latexing. I am no good with it but I am learning. I hope everything I have written is readable. Secondly [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ir37w/questions_about_the_circumference_of_a_circle/) is a link the the r/math cross post.

I have been investigating Minkowski metrics in R^(2). For those who do not know the Minkowski metric in R^(2) with a power

d((x1,y0)) =  (|x1-x0|^(p) + |y1-y0|^(p))^(1/p) 

The equation for a unit sphere centered at (0

d((x,0)) =  (|x|^(p) + |y|^(p))^(1/p) = 1

You can see what these unit circles look like at the Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance). We are only dealing with p &gt; 1. Solving this for y (assuming x and y are positive) we get

y = (1 - x^(p))^(1/p)

And now a differential length segment on this path is

ds = (|dx|^(p) + |dy|^(p))^(1/p)

And the length of the unit circle in the first quadrant is then

∫ds = ∫(|dx|^(p) + |dy|^(p))^(1/p) = ∫(1 + |dy/dx|^(p))^(1/p) dx
with 0 &lt; x &lt; 1

So the plugging in circle equation we found earlier we get

C(p) = 4 ∫(1 + |(d/dx) (1 - x^(p) )^(1/p) |^(p) )^(1/p) dx with 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.

So this is the circumference of the unit circle with a given Minkowski metric using that metric.

So I evaluated this integral numerically for several values of p and plotted the results [here](http://imgur.com/U1k0igP).

As you can see the plot has a value of C(1) = 8 then a minimum at C(2) = 2 Pi then raises again toward C(∞) = 8.

Also by inspection and intuition I thought that there was a symmetry with
 
~~C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1))~~

C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1) +1 ). 

I checked this out and it seems to be true. As gabgoh has pointed out this can be written as

""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1"".

However proving it algebraically seems like a nightmare. Here is a table that supports my claim:

|r     |1/(r -1) + 1 | C(r)        | C(1/(r -1) + 1)|
|----|------------|----------|---------------|
|1.1  |11             |7.51417    |7.51416          |
|1.2  |6               |7.14537    |7.14537         |
|1.3  |4.3333       |6.86894     |6.86894         |
|1.4  |3.5            |6.66555    |6.66555          |
|1.5  |3               |6.51954   |6.51954          |
|1.6  |2.6667        |6.41814   |6.41814          |
|1.7  |2.4286        |6.3511     |6.3511           |
|1.8  |2.25           |6.31027   |6.31027          |
|1.9  |2.1111        |6.28928   |6.28928          |
|2.0  |2.0             |6.28319   |6.28319          |

So my questions about this are why is there a minimum at C(2) = 2 Pi? The Minkowski with a power of 2 is the metric of our universe if nothing is too massive or moving too fast. I believe that the power 2-metric is the only one of these which is rotationally symmetric as well. So this metric seems to have a lot of nice mathematical properties.

The Minkowski-2 metric has the minimum circumference of the Minkowski metrics

And can anyone prove that C(r) = C(1/(r-1) + 1) or equivalently ""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1""?

Thanks for your time. I hope you find this as interesting as I do.

Edit1: Gabgoh has pointed out an error in my original claim. I have changed my proposed equality from C(r-1) = C(1/(r-1)) to C(r) = C(1/(r-1) +1). As well as adding in a table supporting this claim. He has also pointed out that this can be written as ""C(p) = C(q) iff 1/p + 1/q = 1"" which I have noted in the post.",,t5_2s5dh,1374429615.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/puremathematics/comments/1ir7pa/xpost_from_rmath_questions_about_the/

1373228031.0,1htho1,"Question about category theory that came up in ""Cybernetics"" by Norbert Wiener",DerRotfuchs,11,2,13,"Hey

I'm reading ""Cybernetics"" by Wiener this summer, I'm stuck on one of the conclusions that Wiener makes about category theory. I'll start with the basics that Wiener gives (you can probably skip this part, it's kinda long...), then the paragraph on which I'm stuck. (Forgive me ahead of time, I'm very new to LaTeX).

(Skip this if you know the basics of category theory

We start with a group [;X;], since we can replace the binary operator with a set of transformations [;T;] in which we've essentially partially applied the binary operator to every element in [;X;]. For example, if [;X = \mathbb{R} ;], and our binary operator is addition, we can replace that operator with an uncountable set of transformations [;T;] where each transformation in the set just adds some real number to the element [;x;]. 

I won't prove the following, the transformation given by the composition of [; s ;] and [; t ;] will also be in [;T;], and so will [; t^{-1};], so [;T;] is a group closed under composition (with the identity as, surprise, the identity function).

We then define a character to be a function [; f : X \to \mathbb{C} ;] with an associated function [; \alpha : T \to \mathbb{C} ;] with the following properties:

* [; f(t(x)) = \alpha(t(x))f(x) 
* [; f ;] and [; \alpha ;] both always return values of absolute value 1. This is nice since we can just think of the values of the functions as being angles on the circle defined by e^ix in the complex plane.

For example, but Wiener uses it so bear with me), we can set [; f(x) = e^{i \lamba x ;] and [; \alpha(t) = e^{i \lambda t} ;] (same [;\lambda;]) and the relation holds. Similarly we can see that [; f(x) = 1;] works, just let [; \alpha(t) = 1 ;] and it's trivially true.

Wiener then states a very cool fact, but it's really cool actually. First, imagine we change [;T;] by composing all its transformations with [;s;] to get the set [;T';]. Using the fact that [; s, t \in T \implies st \in T;] and [; t \in T \implies t^{-1} \in T;], it's easy to show that [; T = T';] and so their distributions under [;\alpha;] are the same. Furthermore, we can see that [; \alpha(st) = \alpha(s)\alpha(t) ;] as follows:

* [; f(s(t(x)) = f(st(x)) ;]
* [; \alpha(s)f(t(x)) = \alpha(st)*f(x) ;]
* [; \alpha(s)\alpha(t)f(x) = \alpha(st)*f(x) ;]
* [; \alpha(s)\alpha(t) = \alpha(st) ;]

So if we transform [;T;] to [;T';] by composing all [; t \in T;] with some [;s \in T;], \forall s \in T;]. Since the average value of a function is a direct result of it's distribution, we can also say the following:

* [; average(\alpha(T')) = average(\alpha(s)\alpha(T)) ;] 
* [; average(\alpha(T)) = average(\alpha(s)\alpha(T)) ;] 
* [; average(\alpha(T)) = \alpha(s)average(\alpha(T)) ;]

This gives us two options: 

1. [; \alpha(s) = 1 
2. The average is invariant under multiplication by something not 1

(Sorry that took so long

Up to here I understand everything

""From this [fact about the average of [;\alpha;]] it may be concluded that the average of the product of any character by its conjugate (which will also be a character) will have the value 1

Here's where I'm confused. First of all, I don't see how the second part fits in with the [;\alpha;] conclusion either, and I think I've found a counterexample in any case. If we look at the following constant functions: [; f(x) = e^{i\pi} , g(x) = e^ {i\pi/2};], we can see that they both work as characters (just let [;\alpha(t) = 1 , \forall t \in T ;]). But we take the product of f(x) with the conjugate of g(x), we get:

* [; f(x) conjugate(g(x)) ;]
* [; e^{i\pi} e^{-i\pi/2} ;]
* [; e^{i\pi/2} ;]

This product is also a character, not 0. Is there an implicit assumption that we're not using constant functions? Or am I way off the mark on everything?

The full pdf can be found here: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.full.pdf+html

The question is regarding the following passage and has to do with linear algebra. They write: ""where Adj(M′) is the adjugate matrix (also known as the classical adjoint or, we see that the components of v are (up to a sign) the determinants of the 3 × 3 matrices formed from the first three columns of M′, leaving out each one of the four rows in turn. These determinants are unchanged if we add the first column of M′ into the second and third columns. The result of these manipulations is a formula for the dot product of an arbitrary four-vector f with the stationary vector v of the Markov matrix, v · f ≡ D(p; q; f), where D is the 4 × 4 determinant shown explicitly in Fig. 2B. This result follows from expanding the determinant by minors on its fourth column and noting that the 3 × 3 determinants multiplying each fi are just the ones described above.""

To understand the full context you will probably have to read the beginning of the passage, which is sort of intuitive looking at Eq. 2, but I simply do not understand how they got that. Also the immediately following conclusion that the elements of v are the 3x3 column determinants of M' if you were to eliminate from the bottom of the fourth column.

Also to point out a petty mistake but v · f ≡ D(p; q; f) can't be correct as the dimensions do not link up correctly. v' · f ≡ D(p; q; f) is correct. But yet again I grasp that this formulation makes sense

1340679481.0,vly0w,A puzzle about the uncountability of the power set of the natural numbers.,schmendrick,1,0,0,"Let me set up my puzzle in two parts.

**Part 1.**

Cantor's diagonal argument can be used to show that the power set of the natural numbers cannot be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers. We can also understand the result to have to do with the cardinality of the set of functions from the natural numbers to {0, set of infinite sequences of 0s and 1s has greater cardinality than that of the set of natural numbers.

So far

As a corollary

pair the first character of the first sequence with 0 + 1/2
pair the second character of the first sequence with 0 + 2/3
...
pair the n^th character of the first sequence with 0 + n/n+1
...
...
pair the i^th character of the j^th sequence with (i-1) + j/j+1
...

And so we could claim that presenting the range of each member of the set of all total functions from the natural numbers as a sequence which could be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers is impossible. The cardinality of the smallest set containing every range is uncountable

And so presenting all the infinite sequences of 0s and 1s in a sequence of length omega is impossible.

**Part 2.**

If I'm thinking straight about functions from the natural numbers to {0, if f:N --&gt; {0,1}, I can present the same information with the union of f {f | {0}} (f restricted to {0}) union {f | {0,1}} union ... . If this is indeed the case, for every natural number n, we can finitely represent *every* partial function defined on all the natural numbers up to and including n.

**Missing Frames**
By vicnovember


As a sequence of uniform


Imagine, each of which stretches for 2.5 billion feet.  The reels are identical in every way and when stretched taut, they line up precisely.  At 16 frames per foot, each reel should contain 40 billion frames.  However, when each frame is counted individually, the reels contain a potentiality for margin of error.  Each reel’s frame-count becomes, then, the count has the potential for flux in either direction.  One reel may contain 40 billion frames plus 1; they other may contain 40 billion minus 3.


Note that when using a phrase like “margin of error,000,000 frames were 1/100,000,000^th of a frame short, resulting in one less frame in the total count.  Or the fact that in reality, 35mm film stock is closer to 16.04 frames per foot.  We are not interested in precise calculations


Why, do we still experience this state of flux?  


The answer lies in the number itself.  The number “40 billion” was not chosen arbitrarily, comparing the results only at the end of the process.  An identical result, as expected.  Predicted by the simple mathematics governing countable sets and thereby effectively removing this state of flux.  


But what happens when we double the length of the film?  Quadruple it?  Exponentially increase it?  We are left with a *theoretically*-countable number of frames


Thus, 0, 1, 2, ...}, what we are describing is an *uncountably finite* set, such as {0, 2


To say that we have 9 trillion feet of film which consequently contains 144 trillion frames is all well and good and mathematically sound *until we begin counting*.  Since we “know” the measurement of 9 trillion feet to be accurate


Can a finite number be *functionally* infinite?  The concept of *transfinite* numbers is well-known


It is therefore the very *process* of counting that renders the number’s actual value uncertain.  The absolute value of any cardinal number is easily determined by its integer – the absolute value of 3 is 3, we are here discussing cardinal numbers rather than all rational, irrational or transcendental numbers.]   But as soon as a count begins, the number’s potential for infinity throws its absolute value into flux *until the count is either completed or abandoned*.  Like an inverse of Schrödinger’s cat (which exists in a quantum state of both life and death until observed), the uncountably finite number achieves a quantum state of both ""finity"" and infinity *while being counted*.  When the count is completed, the absolute value is affirmed.  If the count is abandoned, the number reverts to its accepted absolute value.


This is not to suggest that in the counting process we might encounter an entirely new integer.  Or that an integer as it would appear in a complete sequence might slip from existence.  It is merely intended to illustrate the push-and-pull power that infinity holds over the absolute value of elements in a countable set.


Just as *Tristram Shandy*’s eponymous narrator spends the entirety of his life writing his autobiography, we find that a countable set becomes functionally infinite very quickly.
