I was hoping that maybe we could choose a data set each month (week?) and collectively analyze it.

The analyses may include:

1. Defining simple hypotheses and testing them.

2. Estimating various parameters.

3. Carrying out diagnostic procedures to test our model assumptions.

4. Some cool ways of visualizing the data.

I feel that this would be beneficial for statisticians regardless of skill level. If you are an expert then this may help you practice what you know and flex your statistical muscle. Beginners can also learn how the process works and pick up on tips and 'tricks' of the trade.

If this is successful then maybe we can have our own repository of methods and how to use them. Maybe start with data sets that address commonly asked questions. For example, simple ANOVA and regression, etc. Also, participants may want to provide their code so others can use it and build upon it.

I would love to get your feedback on this. Comments

Edit: Nice to see there's some interest in this. The next step: I have been browsing some data sets from public repositories. I will pick one and get the ball rolling by providing code for data input and basic statistical functions. Perhaps suggest some hypotheses to investigate.

**If you have a data set in mind please PM me.**

Edit2: So glad that many of you like the idea. So to start off I will pick a simple enough data set with some interesting properties that we can exploit for the first exercise. Don't like the data or have something better in mind? That's fine

As for the format, SPSS, or whatever you're comfortable with) and code for basic analyses. Also, just to start things off, I will suggest some hypothesis and do a step by step on how to test it. Then we see where it goes from there.

* BUGS is one of the standard tools for Bayesian inference. There are certain problems that are intractable in BUGS that Stan is capable of resolving.

I guess my question is pretty big. In short: what kinds of things would I want to use Stan to model? What are some things that Stan can do that BUGS can't? What are some things that BUGS does well? What is the need that Stan is filling? Why is everyone so excited?

Here's my situation

* Graduated undergrad 2005; math/physics/philosophy triple major; magna cum laude; honors in physics.
* PhD in physics 2011.
* Computer programming (my biggest weakness): took one class in programming C in 2005 but use computers and program in python daily for the past 6 years. Not a programmer's programmer
* Dual citizen US/UK -- willing/able to work in US or UK.

I have two years to get myself ""into shape"" for a stats-based career. I'm willing to realistically spend a solid 5 hours/week to learning and practicing what needs to be done. I'm not afraid of learning/studying, and creating statistical testing of the results.

My question is in two parts:

A) Do you have specific recommendations of job-types that I should spend time researching? That is

B) What should I be working on for the next two years in order for me to have the best shot at getting these jobs? Anything from math to learn

*The SAS license is crushingly expensive* but that doesn't necessarily mean it's any better or worse than R. In fact, Frank Harrell Jr., etc. I can download the source code for R, compile the binaries myself, and read help files which tell me exactly how models were fit. For instance, all GLMs are fit using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. That sounds like validated software to me!

Lastly, sum of squares stuff. Why not a t-test? It completely masks the estimate of interest: a mean difference comparing the Yes group to Nos. SAS additionally gives pages and pages of worthless output. So when there's one thing you want, it's buried in a haystack. This wastes paper! Worse still, the eager statistician has more output in front of him or her to overinterpret. Sometimes, you just fit a linear model and report a coefficient and a confidence interval and you're done. I don't need ANOVA or likelihood information (if I did, I'd be willing to do extra work to extract them).

*SAS syntax and layout is terrible*! There is no equivalence equality distinction. You write code like:

    if time = 1 then time = 0;

The assignment operator is *reversed* for ODS output. Who ever had this terrible idea? I'd rate it with the system lag Windows does every time there's a minor security issue: worst ideas in programming, except for UCLA, are all extremely deprecated! The SAS community is a private, unhelpful bunch. And SAS's GUI looks like Win 3.1, am I right?

*R is free as in beer and speech* and incorporation could greatly improve the regulatory research field. User questions are very well documented and it's easy to just Google solutions for simple problems.  It is by far MORE capable than SAS and I just don't believe the rumor that SAS is better with large datasets. I have worked with millions of rows of data with hundreds of variables and both are equally slow. As for ""validated"" software: Validation is a matter of documentation and independent reproduction of results using a blinded 3rd party agent without conflict of interest. Validation is not guaranteed by a single statistical software. I can generate the wrong results in either program!

* I don't know it
* I strongly suspect that it's missing the breadth of packages that R has
* RStudio (yeah

I have done the udacity course on intro to stats and am auditing a few other courses but I don't understand the concepts as well as I'd like to - I don't know if this is the curse of being a cs/maths student or if I'm just not getting it.

However
haunting realization that Windows and Unix (and Linux) don't really talk to one another.
Why is this a big deal? It can cost you time to capriciously use OS dependent syntax when you have to revise large chunks of code. Here are examples of this 
that statisticians run into frequently:

**Path dependency**:

1. Network drives: First off
maximum of 26 network drives. Why Windows thought this was useful boggles my mind
But distributed computing was an afterthought with Window's operating system (it wasn't originally designed to share or work collaboratively on *anything* 
unlike Unix). If you need to find out what your system drives are
show the cross-platform compatible name of that drive.

2. Absolute versus relative path references: I have recently overhauled *all* of my code to get rid of relative path references entirely. I now have a ctl.r 
file that I source that points to all locations for a project, rpt, src, dat, tab, fig, and so on. This allows me to swap 
and copy and completely gut out project directory structures so I only have to change one file to know where to find all the relevant materials for that 
project. This is an issue because your scheduler may run batch R from some completely arbitrary directory
export a './fig/myGraphic.pdf' then your system will look in '//HOME/schedulers/ctlcharts/fig' regardless of whether it exists or not. This can run into 
write permission problems and cause your program to break.

3. The `setwd()` command should be deprecated. This is only convenient when you've launched interactive R in Windows from a directory that doesn't make sense 
to you. You can't use that command from its interactive shell in Unix.

**System commands**:

1. Windows shell is a sad thing. I use it for ping but whenever I need to do more than that I get frustrated and use Cygwin instead. Nonetheless
Cygwin
oldFile newFile""`), MV? WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?!"". The kosher way to manipulate files in the 
system directory is with R's host of `file.*` commands. `file.remove` to delete

2. When all else fails
You can use R to determine what system you're using with `Sys.info()[1]`. Then use your Windows syntax if it's Windows and your Unix syntax if it's Unix.

*Por exemplo*

    if (Sys.info()[1] == 'Windows') {
      system('copy //Home/myfig.pdf //Groups/myproject/fig/myfig.pdf')
    } else {
      system('cp //Home/myfig.pdf //Groups/myproject/fig/myfig.pdf')

My college only offers two statistics courses, a year. Also

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning! I'm a perpetual undergraduate at this point (starting year 6 this Fall and looking at least at another 2-3 years before I'll apply to a graduate school - I'd graduated previously, one as a general statistics course and the other as an applied statistics to the social sciences (Less theory, more application, wider variety of tests and understanding), I've realized the actual introductory applications using algorithms with light algebra are great, but simple (Mathematically).

Halfway through my second course, the first standard deviation is located at the area in the curve where the slope changes from exponentially negative to converging on zero. Except the book didn't even use any mathematical terms like that, it literally said where the line stops dropping so steeply and begins to even out. 

And then I realized that's a point of inflection in the curve (Second derivative = 0). And it was the first time I actually saw any relevance to Calculus or math at a higher level than algebra. Of course, the area under the curve that we talk about for SD +-1 being 68%, SD +- 2 being 95%, etc is literally the area under the curve which I can calculate with calculus, etc.

And then I felt bad. Neither of my courses actually connected any of this to Calculus or any other class outside of ""Hey, and here's a bunch of equations and tests and what they mean! You can now do surveys, polls, and find significant results!"".

So, where the significance of it all comes from? What should I be reading, studying, and exposing myself to? My biggest problem with learning Calculus was that the only application they gave us was ""Use it to find the volume of this tin can!"", or other similar applications which were great for demonstration but felt meaningless in the real world.

I considered a second major in math but was completely turned off after trying my hand at abstract algebra because I couldn't stand the rigor of proofs inherent in pure mathematics.

To get more to the point, also seems to contradict itself too often to be as useful as it could be.  Relatedly, I often get the impression that psychology overgeneralizes too much, producing a portrait of human behavior that is far from universal.  I want to note that I am not trying to disparage psychology in saying this (much of my present perspective is derived from my coursework in cultural psychology and neuro), but I do believe that its present modus operandi needs to be critiqued and improved.  It is my conviction that a great deal of this criticism must come from the world of statistics, and I would like to look more towards the statistical worldview.

What I would like at the end of the day is a best guess at Lifetime Value and Conversion Rate so we can make breakeven decisions about these marketing campaigns early on.  Both LTV and Conversion Rate take some time to ""stabilize"".  I can come up with a number for our population in general pretty easily.  In plain English: we expect X% of accounts to convert and to pay $Y over the course of their tenure.

But I don't want to assume that each affiliate is the same as the general population.  But I also don't want to judge future accounts of that affiliate based on very small numbers of past accounts for some of them.  It seems like Bayesian inference is the way to go.

I remember the basic math being not that difficult.  Conversion Rate would be a proportion

So:

Q1: Am I way off-base here?
Q2: Can you point me to basic resources to refresh me on the math?

I was always so excited doing Bayesian stuff in school because it was a worldview-changer for me. But this is the first time I've seen a really compelling real-world use case for me. (I'm probably not looking hard enough for others.)

This all points to the ""law of averages"" that over time the sample proportion will get closer to the true proportion.  This would seem to imply that resampling methods such as jackknife and bootstrap capitalize on these facts to provide more variances than are actually contained in the dataset by either systematically or randomly reusing and redistributing the variances.(depending on the method used)

I received my bachelors in marketing a couple years ago. It's a big change

The problem is that my college math load was light. I have credit for calc 3 and an intro to statistics class. My plan going forward is to do some 'self guided' online math classes through a university for linear algebra, PDEs, and whatever other stats classes I can take.

I've browsed the CS and math advice for grad schools, and letters of references will have a hard time judging my advanced math abilities. My small advantage is that I can code fairly well. I would like to put together a website with examples of statistic and programming work as a portfolio. 

Do I stand a chance at a top grad school phd program? or should I opt to pay for a masters first? Advice?

For the first question, rare, legendary) or if it also affects the number of magical properties on an item (4, 5, or 6 magical properties specifically). I'm tabulating the properties of the items I find while playing with two different amounts of magic find on my character.

For instance, and 25% have 6. With gear set #2 I may find that 40% have 4 properties, 30% have 5, and 30% have 6. I'd like to compare these two sets of proportions/percentages to know if they are statistically different. I don't know if they should be compared as a set to each other or if I should compare the proportion of 4s to each other, 5s to each other, and 6s to each other.

For the second question

- I don't have much coursework in statistics. My decision to study it is based on parts of some courses (scientific programming, biology, and education but feel I could best get into those fields with the stat background rather than the field-specific background. Will my lack of coursework in stat make it really hard to get in?

First, the test result will be negative(-) 95% of the time.

    P(+|S) = 0.95
    P(-|H) = 0.95

Everybody is either Healthy or Sick

Now, because we have a test that is accurate 95% of the time.  But that logic doesn't hold.  Given a positive test result, the conditional probability of being sick could be as little as zero.  Imagine if almost the entire population is healthy - in this case almost all of the positive test results are simply false positives and therefore very few of them are sick.  You would need to have some idea what proportion of your patients are sick (call this a 'prior') in order to calculate probabilities that condition on the data.

So, when we condition on the data, the statement might not be true at all.  We lose all optimism as soon as we see the data.  We need to make further statements (priors) if we wish to have a basis to calculate conditional probabilities such as P(S|+).

We can replace Healthy and Sick with two conventional hypotheses, given a particular observed dataset, how reasonable the hypotheses are.  Does *this* data tell us that one hypothesis now looks better than it did?  I find it difficult to get a frequentist to make any such statement from a confidence interval.

We can change the setup further

The parameter isn't a random variable, and of the resulting interval, is a random variable whose distribution depends on the parameter.  It is meaningful to make statements, in advance of the experiments, about the probability that the interval will contain the true value of the parameter.

But we can make no such statements *after* we have looked at the data.  Once the data is seen and the confidence interval is calculated

Or can you? Clearly, but I am unwilling to make any statement that is based on this data.""

As far as I can see, but they simply have ""no comment"" on the just-observed data.

I'm not really too interesting in *justifying* the frequentist interpretation.  We could argue all day about the validity or otherwise of writing down priors on hypotheses and treating hypotheses as random variables.

So, have you learned anything about the parameter that you didn't know before the experiment?  If not, why did you do the experiment?  If so, tell me what you have learned.

Contrast this with the use of p-values.  Given a low p-value, I find it difficult to get anybody to say that they now feel that they have a better idea what the value of the parameter is, specifically that it is within the interval.  As far as I can see, p-values skirt close to being Bayesian - see [this pdf on the opposing and contradictory philosophies between Fisherian p-values and Neyman-Pearson error rates](http://www.uv.es/sestio/TechRep/tr14-03.pdf).

3. If not

4. And in general: what's your experience with Revolution R?

Many thanks!

**Edit:**

I just tried the community version of Revolution R (from official Ubuntu repositories).
Parallelizing my code was trivial using the foreach package.  Now my
script uses both cores of my machine!  As far as I understand
code also on a cluster if Revolution R Enterprise is installed there.

Converting the code comes down to replacing for-loops and lapplys by
the foreach construct:

    foreach (i=1:100) %dopar% {
      heavy.lifting(i)
    }

In order to make this parallel you have to register the parallel
computing backend for foreach:

    library(multicore)
    library(doMC)
    library(foreach)

    registerDoMC(2)

The last line initializes to worker processes.  The iterations of a
foreach call are distributed to these workers.  The nice
thing: if you want to run your code in a standard R
foreach package without registering a backend.  The iterations of the
loop are then executed sequentially.

1354881908.0,14fv87,[Help needed] multinomial logistic regression in R,Swiss_redditor,14,4,17,"Hello everyone.

I am working at the moment on my master thesis. I am analyzing my data at the moment and I have a lot of trouble to get through it.

I have been told in [that thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/13xlq5/need_help_to_analyse_data_behavioral_biology/) that I should use multinomial logistic regression.

I will just explain here what I have as data (each bullet is a column in my text file):

* date
* time
* ActivityX
* ActivityY
* Temperature
* Behavior
* Valley
* Age
* Month
* Year
* kid
* individual

Where date and time are the value for the day and time when the activity (on x and y axis) were registered. The temperature is the temperature when the activity was registered.

I have made a recursive partitioning to find out for each activity to what behavior it correspond (based on field data I gathered).

The valley is where the individual lived (2 different valleys)

The age corresponds to how old the individual is.

The month is in what month the data was registered. Same for the year.

Kid is a Yes or No variable (if the individual has a kid or not). And the Individual is the number associated to him (the tag on his ear).

By individual I mean alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). All the data (except from the one I gathered on the field) is GPS data.

My goal is to check for correlation between the Behavior (4 different possible: [R]esting, [R]uning) and the temperature, month, year, age, valley (and maybe later if it has a kid or not), also I want to account for the individual (since they might not all behave the same way all the time).

Now my big problem is that I can't do that on R

I hope someone here can help me with that

EDIT2:

I have written up [a short description](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1lfGuYl6U_GRnNESXVtYXUwUjA) (ok- it's about 1700 words) of how the theory I'm describing specifically works

My vague idea is that there are three axis: subject, the transformations and links between relations will become clear at a glance

edit3: looks like there are 4 variables: knowledge, time), which I'm not sure if that means 2 graphs or what but either six sets of correlational data or 1 graph with all 4 dimensions/axis/variables super imposed. 

EDIT 4

To the critics of this idea: I just discovered a book considered heretical in my field [*Graphs Maps Trees* by Franco Moretti](http://books.google.ca/books?id=YL2kvMIF8hEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). It was written in 2005 and plots/graphs/visualizes literary history by way of statistical data sets scraped from literature

Yes, thanks.

EDIT 5:

I'm afraid that something is being lost in translation here. I'm not refusing to share the sources (see below)- the problem is that I don't think reading them will help you help me. 

Foucault's writing is esoteric and dense and requires a considerable amount of background reading to penetrate. Not only that, like the Bible), while actively conceptualizing and refining and redefining his theory of how to proceed next, as he goes. His framework isn't a like a guide book or a walkthrough, it is developed over the course of his 20+ years of thinking, criticizing the world around him and looking for historical roots and origins of contemporary problems, finding those inaugural notions and then tracing their existence (characterizing  or plotting their relations I believe) in various periods of time, in various societies and in various discourses. 

The end result being a robust framework which reveals powerful, which is itself trapped from public consumption by virtue of it's hidden, confusing and exclusionary (and typically Foucaultian) representation. I want to fix that, I want to help people 'get' what Foucault does and 'get' why its so important and useful, at a glance. 

Now I've done all the background reading and I have written up an analysis of how his analysis works. What I don't have

[The Subject and Power](http://www.scribd.com/doc/114767303/M-Foucault-The-Subject-and-Power) and [What is an Author?](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/Gustafson/FILM%20162.W10/readings/foucault.author.pdf)

Hi all

This is my first post to r/statistics. Coming from a EE background

I have researched this topic but keep getting hit over the head with it. Everything I have read about independence gives me the text book definition but no way of really utilizing it. 

I know that for two random variables to be independent, in every wiki, book, and link I have seen. Thats great. Thats fantastic. But frankly I dont see how it helps me 'on the ground'.

So

1) I have two data vectors. a[n] and b[n]. Each is length N. Lets say N = 1000. Lets say that a[n] measured temperature every day. And lets say that b[n] measured, the number of newborns born at some hospital for each day. I know intuitively those two are independent... I have those two vectors... _what do I type into my MATLAB to show they are independent?_ My fingers are on the keyboard with ML open ready to go. 


2) Again I have two data vectors, and b[n] (help me out here) might be umm, the temperature squared? I hesitate to use humidity because I want b[n] to be uncorrelated to a[n] but still dependent. If you can think of a better example by all means use it, but the over arching question is, again, given those two vectors, _what do I do to the data here on my computer in code

I'm at a 2.5 right now and it's just going to get worse after this semester for sure. I don't have much of an excuse. My GPA really plummeted because of my 3rd year

Anyway

I really want to break into finance, no half decent grad school will even take me for a masters in stats or financial engineering or whatever. I only held one job that is somewhat relevant, doing research for a small firm last summer. 

I am really lost and don't know what to do with my life after I graduate...my GPA is the thing I'm most worried about right now. Sure many people say that job hunting isn't solely GPA dependent

It sucks

I've enjoyed reading the different educational links and discussions we've had on this subreddit. Our group is certainly diverse, and other academic / non-academic contexts. 

A few times, acronyms and have no clear, defined scientific question.

To start a point of reference

* Make a short

* Give a good solid paragraph of scientific background so that we can understand the problem. Define jargon. Use your Standard Academic Approach to Acronyms [SAAA]

* Ask a clear well defined question. If it's not quantitative, but don't entangle them into a single question because it's just confusing. Different sentences for different ideas.

* Mention any approaches you are trying and why there might be a problem (e.g. the reviewer says they want a non-parametric test).

* Be open to different philosophies. Different people have had different training and backgrounds and will potentially recommend wildly different strategies for each problem.

* Try to use the correct language for your problem. We might have to retool your thinking because a conventional word can mean something completely different in statistics. Frequently, but want to know if any change in one variable effects a change in another variable.

* If there's a serious statistical precedent in your field, some scores for certain disorders are almost always analyzed using linear regression. If we didn't know that, we might suggest a proportional odds model or another cumulative link if the number of categories are small. We're obviously not gonna poke around 12-13 articles in the Journal of Psychiatric Research to find this out.

Not knowing what to do


Originally


I did apply to some schools and got an offer for a MSc in Statistics. I was excited at first but my tendency to over think things is hindering my ability to make a decision. 


My main problem is that I'm not fully sure what I may be getting myself into. The people I know in real life barely know anything about the field and most equate it to accounting (because you deal with numbers


During my undergraduate education I only took 3 statistics courses: research statistics (intro to stats), I thoroughly enjoyed. Survey design might have been the least enjoyable - researching, analyzing results and presenting on what, how and why I did not mind, I actually enjoyed it, but administering the surveys... oh god, never again.


During the year off I've been dabbling with programming on my free time.  Learned some C, but surprisingly self learning it is enjoyable and not at all frustrating, albeit slower than in a formal setting)


What I'm trying to say is that I'm not sure what it is like studying statistics. I'm sure it's unlike  any intro to stats I've taken. I don't feel like I've been exposed enough to the field to have a burning desire to jump right in


This turned out longer that I expected. Apologies if I rambled too much. Do ask questions if needed and any advice/insight will be appreciated.

Some time ago I followed a statistics course and one thing has been nagging me... I hope some of you can help me understand.

Consider the following setup: you take measurements from two devices D1 and D2 that are of the same make and type (e.g. thermometers that are very close together).

Suppose we want to check is both thermometers are behaving the same. One could be an expensive calibrated device

If I understand correctly, given the null hypothesis of the devices having the same distribution. If it is below the threshold, the null hypothesis will be rejected.

Now here's my beef with this: it is a priori completely obvious that there will be *some* difference in the two devices, and by taking enough measurements we will in principle have to reject the null *always*, at *any* level of significance. The only reason why we would not do that is because we haven't collected enough samples.

So my question is this: Is the setup above a statistically valid method of approaching the question posed? If so, anything follows.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

So service rate would refer to the rate at which request entities are serviced by service entities.

I am trying to simulate, so please advise further and correct my statements where necessary.

Monte carlo simulation (MCS) goes through different samples within the population of data with different sizes in many iterations to essentially randomise the data and give the likelihood of the balance of my account (in this case).

So, it picks 3 out of 10 trades in random order and using the pre-specified position size parameter MCS will say using those 3 trades as a guide your account is up 1 %. And it goes through many iterations to see the impact on my account when the bets are placed where I determine the fixed bet size.

This is obviously more fairer than just calculating what happens to account balance when all 10 historical trades are made sequentially with fixed position size because MCS doesn't assume the order of historical transactions to repeat exactly as the data in the future.

What I am trying to do is simplify this process by using just set of key information from the historical transactions detail. If I have 10 trades

So rather than letting the MCS run different iterations with actual data I can simply use random function to specify how many within the sequence should be picked and determine whether each trade is a win or a loss based on the win probability already known and randomly determine the win or loss size based on the standard deviation around the mean. 

And if i specified.. 2% risk per trade it will go through the simulation to see what happens to my account balance. After, will it simply find the average of all results ?

Thanks for reading this much.

I am desperately trying to learn.. so please help clarify my understanding.

Thanks.

Last year I built a simple OLS model based on data from a few prior years.  I came in second place out of 15 people.

This year I plan to get more sophisticated and try to work with decision tree analysis and machine learning methods.

I was wondering if anyone else is planning to do this and would be interested in sharing ideas over the next week and a half?

One solution I came up with was to toss the coins twice. The possible out comes and their probabilities would be  
HH = pp  
HT = pq  
TH = qp  
TT = qq  

Now if we define a process where two coins are tossed and if the first is head and second is tail team A wins (HT) and if the first is tail and second is head team B wins (TH). If the head or tail repeats (HH or TT) we discard the toss and toss again. This will of course be very inefficient since we will be on average doing 4 tosses to make 1 decision (this depends on p

To take it further you can draw a random sample from any distribution and use any arbitrary cutoff to define head or tail and still be able to use this approach to make a fair decision.

I have a categorical dependent variable and a categorical independent variable. I have experience with conducting a Chi-Squared test and checking to see if there is a significant non-independence result. I also have experience with checking if the absolute value of the standardised residual is greater than 2 for any individual value (which would show that it is driving the non-independence result). However

I would like to compare two different proportions within the Chi Squared analysis (or if anyone can think of another test, England etc) along the side and 'stream type' (either 1,2 or 3) along the top. In this table I have the proportions calculated along the rows (so 1,2 and 3 add up to 100 percent). I would like to compare (Scotland,2) to (England,2). These proportions differ, 38% to 29% respectively and I would like to know if the difference is significant.
