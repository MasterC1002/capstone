I'm sad that I had to actually update the sidebar to include this

/r/tattoos is meant for tattoos, but it does mean that anyone - guy or girl - should be comfortable posting a picture of themselves here without a barrage of comments about them physically.  

Tattoos are on skin, and sometimes people don't have access to photo editing, blur, or whatever else you could think of to make the picture more PG.
