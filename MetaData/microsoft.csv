I am putting this here instead of sending it to your mail servers as this would likely end up as lost words of one person.  Here on Reddit

Fervently oppose CISPA.

You have an opportunity to stand up and be a leader in a fight to protect your users’ privacy from a government that increasingly wants to deny us freedoms.  I pose to your two reasons why you should work to stop it.

1.  We have no champion.  We need someone to rally behind.  Google has not opposed it, but we noticed when you said no to SOPA.  We will notice if you say no to CISPA.  The louder you say no, the more we will notice.

2.  Lawmakers might be writing the words the way you want them and you may be willing to make the concessions they want this time, it will set a precedent for chipping away at the freedoms that exist on the Internet.  There will be a next time.  Then there will be a next time.  Then there will be another SOPA that you will want to stop but it will be too late.

I hope this will not fall on deaf ears.  I expect it will.  I have written my Senators and my Congressman.  I now implore you to do something unexpected

Sincerely
An anonymous user of Microsoft products

1353083200.0,13ay9t,Thoughts on Steven Sinofsky,surilamin,112,34,93,"*I'll try to keep this short as my English is not great (it's my second language), and not repeat the same mistakes again.*

I have seen a lot of coverage about Sinofsky's departure that has been very biased.  It's pretty clear that bloggers and certainly the Technorati did not like Sinofsky at all.  The reason for this is quite simple, being secretive has benefited Apple very much in creating crazy amounts of hype.  To understand why Sinofsky did this, you have to take a look back at Windows Vista when it was code named Longhorn and put things in context and perspective.  

Longhorn was a very ambitious project whose development dates back to 2001, and radical new sidebar to replace the taskbar, and significant changes to the kernel.  It also would bring technologies named ‘Avalon and Indigo’ which eventually ended up as a much different technology called what we now know as Windows Presentation Foundation.  Longhorn was headed up by Jim Allchin who showed off a lot of what was planned for Longhorn at PDC 2003.  People were genuinely excited about what Microsoft was doing at this time, and Microsoft was the dominant technology company at this time too.  What we later found out was the demos showed at PDC 2003 were faked demos and concept videos, and not real code running.  If you look at Microsoft demos today, they always emphasize that this is real code running on a real machine in real time.  As we would find out, Microsoft overpromised and would severely under-deliver.  Over the next two years Jim Allchin would royally fuck up the development of Longhorn.  I remember installing Longhorn Build 4074 in 2004, but it stopped being defended among Microsoft supporters and this led to massive perception problems.  Apple starting to rise around this time too with iPod now gaining serious traction.  Microsoft failed to respond to Vista criticism; marketing has always been a problem at Microsoft.  

Now to Sinfosky.  Sinofsky joined Microsoft in 1989 (the year I was born!) at the age of 23, Microsoft's leadership at the time put some other products under Sinofsky’s control.  (From sfgate article)  This ultimately led to Sinofsky becoming in charge of Office, starting with Office 2000.  He became known for getting office released office on time, Office 2000, then Office XP, Office 2003, and finally Office 2007.  Interesting to note, and was responsible for introducing the ribbon in Office 2007.  Steve and Julie did have a relationship for a little bit

So, and we now have Bill Gates saying he will step down in 2008.  Bill Gates chose Ray Ozzie to be his replacement.  Ray Ozzie proved to be disastrous and had no vision for consumers. Ballmer has been CEO for a couple years now at this time. With Microsoft not wanting the next operating system to take 5 years to be released and clear hole in leadership, Steven Sinofsky stepped up to filled the gap. He was especially valuable because he had a proven track record of getting things done on time.  In addition he had overseen an ambitious version of Office that was just released (Office 2007) which had paid off well.  

In 2008 Sinofsky wrote a memo called Translucency vs. Transparency in a blogpost.  This really got bloggers pissed off.  And we went from a company that poured its heart out about Vista, or going to either Windows Azure or Windows Entertainment (Xbox) side of the company.  Notably, J Allard and Robbie Bach stepped down in 2010, many said this was related to Sinofsky but this simply is not the case.  Zune failure and a billion dollar right off due to overheating problems with xbox hardware contributed to them leaving. 

Sinofsky ended up delivering a great product with Windows 7 and more importantly it was on time.  He brought a lot of changes to the start menu and how the taskbar works.  Sinofsky continued to rise and gain power within Microsoft as the development of Windows 8.   He and Julie-Larson Green took a serious look at where the world was going, he did not allow a tablet version of the Windows Phone operating system.  Tablet sales have always been a subset of the phone sales.  More iphones sold than ipads, more android phones sold than android tablets, and more blackberrys sold than playbooks.  A very small number of Windows Phones had been sold, an even smaller number of Windows Phone Tablets would have been sold.  I’m sure it would have been a great product, but would ultimately be a waste of resources.  Windows Phone 7/7.5 also decided to go with managed code rather than native code.  In theory, this sounds great and there is a lot of promise to it, .net

So, Mary-Jo Foley, and many others.  However, they have been absolutely atrocious when it comes to covering Steve Sinofsky.  The hate Sinofsky because he has not openly given them information about Windows 7 and Windows 8 development and decided to keep more things secret.   This last week on Paul Thurrott’s two podcasts he openly admitted he hates Sinofsky because it made it harder for him to write his book.  Sinofsky did not give Thurrott internal builds of Windows 8, so he could write his book more easily.  Thurrott also believes he is entitled to get information from Microsoft because he writes about Microsoft and helps consumers with technical problems.  I am sure many of you remember Thurrott freaking out about Microsoft removing aero glass from Windows even though it was the right decision due to battery life.  Well it now turns out that Thurrott was only angry about it because he was forced to re-take screenshots for his book because now there was no aero.  Microsoft is a private corporation that can do what it wants and Thurrott is not owed anything.  Mary-Jo Foley also said she hates Sinofsky because he had her blacklisted from Microsoft.  Bloggers may be financially better off without Sinofsky because they can get more information and write more blog posts with more access to the company.  Lot of traffic also went to Sinofky’s own blog, instead of other blogs.  The pundits also say Sinofsky was hard to work with an arrogant.  It's clear they've never worked for a corporation.  Well Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were also arrogant, condescending and tough to work with.  Leaders have to make tough decisions and this will always piss some people off.  Other complaints include that he did not embrace Silverlight.  Silverlight was a bastardized version of WPF which was too resource intensive.  It’s dying.  Why embrace something that is dying?  Also the pundits suggest Scott Guthrie would be a great replacement for Sinofsky.  Are you fucking kidding me?  We need a person in charge who will fight for consumers and make radical changes

Sinofsky has been nothing but excellent for Microsoft.  He has fought for consumers and made the tough decisions that others would not have.  Sinofsky made the trains run on time. He embraced the Metro design language

Edit: Should also be noted that Thurrott was snubbed for an early SurfaceRT review and has been slamming it ever since.  What a crybaby. 

*Fuck

**tl;dr:** **Steven Sinofsky rocks and was good for Microsoft!  I also believe he quit on his own accord.  Bloggers hate him because they had a direct financial loss due to having less information about the company and ignore the good he did.**

P.S. Love/Hate relationship with Sinofsky and bloggers can be traced way back to 2007 starting with Long Zheng http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071207/director-windows-disclosure/

I pre-ordered the Surface RT and got it October 26th.  Absolutely love the device. However, and the person says they will send me a box so I can send it back and get it taken care of.  Call 2 weeks later because I see no box, rep says ""no, we don't send a box, you have to send it yourself"".  Great, had someone tell me misinformation.  It happens.  Whatever. So I send it in, the device, and keyboard (as the rep said).

Fastforward, causing the screen to malfunction.  Call up support, more or less the same, I send it in right away this time.  Kinda angry that it's the second defective one I've had, but whatever.

Fast forward to today.  I get it back, apparently they ""changed their policy"" so now you only send in the device, not everything.  Well, great.  The employee did not tell me this when I sent it in.  Now it will be 3-5 days for them to contact me back so they can figure out what to do about sending me my things.  THEN they will ship it again, which means another 3-5 days minimum.  Meanwhile, my Surface has spent more time being shipped back and forth than actually in my hands.  

Seriously Microsoft, incompetent support teams, and right now, a brick. 

Rant over.  Just.  Angry.

Edit: spelling

**Update:**  So today the other two parts came in (at different times).  I don't understand why they ship everything separately, but I was just at the breaking point with the customer support.  

Only problem I have with the device now is that the kickstand is slightly loose (maybe warped),,False,self,t5_2qh1b,1356738017.0,,True

1346169666.0,yyt26,[meta] Potential Microsoft subreddit network design(?),toaster1,72,10,56,"Hey there. I'm going to preface this post by saying that I am not a moderator for any of these subreddits and have no experience in HTML. That said- let us begin.

Recently I've become incredibly passionate about Microsoft and its component brands, and they weren't very lively. I'm crossposting this because I have an idea that can combat both these issues- a Microsoft Reddit Network. It would be a direct link in the upper area between /r/microsoft, /r/windows, /r/xbox360, /r/bing and /r/windowsphone.

[Behold

It incorpreates the Modern UI design language into everything. Tiles at  the top serve as a link between the seperate subreddits, which colourises depending on which subreddit you are in. Everything else should probably also be based off that subreddit. It's here if you want to check it out- /r/xbox360)

The purpouses of the subreddits would step beyond what their names would suggest if this were to occour. Microsoft would remain unchanged, lastly, take Internet Explorer, Skydrive and Outlook/Hotmail under its roof- serving as a hub for MS's internet/web app offerings.

The other designs

I hope I'm not stepping on any moderator's toes for any of these subreddits. If I am, but after that, they could easily just continue as usual.

If I'm not annoying anybody

Thanks for your time! :]

**Tons of new features!**

In this update

* **You can now view comments in Preview Mode!** The full array of commenting features (like changing sorting) are still only available on the dedicated Article Page
* **I handle more reddit.com links internally!** This means that when you click on a post in r/bestof, links in comments that point to reddit.com), but that'll be addressed later.
* **You can change the color scheme!** Don't like the various blues that I use? Change them!
* **User pages!** You can now view your own user page in the Accounts dropdown
* **Quick actions!** I've made it easier to do common actions like upvote, I'll show a couple links for those sorts of actions, making them one click away. For touch, I've added options to customize the swipe-select and double-tap behavior, so you can, for instance, make the app bar appear on left-swipe
* **The app remember links you've visited!** I'll gray out the title of stories once you've visited them. I also added an appbar command to un-visit a link if you don't want to forget to look at it later. History should roam between computers
* **Performance increases!**. The app performs a lot better on devices like the Surface.
* **Load more comments!** As you scroll
* **Fixed the blank-screen-on-launch bug!** I had a terrible bug involving the Store's ""app was installed!"" toast that would put my app in a bad state where it only showed a blank page. I finally tracked down the issue and fixed it. PM me if you're interested in the technical side =)

And this is just a partial list! The full list can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_to_go/comments/11si5c/change_log/). 

I encourage you all to download it and try it out! Leave feedback if you want anything added/changed. A lot of stuff in this version was the direct result of feedback I've received. And go Pro! if you love the app! No, and get in while the price is its cheapest.

Ill start with the ones I know.

* ¶ = Windows Key

**¶ + Pause/Break** = System Properties

**¶ + E** = This Computer

**¶ + D** = Go to desktop

**¶ + L** = Lock your computer

**¶ + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0** 
(Each number represents the icon on your taskbar so you can quickly start up the programs that you've attached to it)

**Alt + D** = Go to URL/Location (works in all explorer windows and browsers)

**Ctrl + T** = New tab in a browser

**Ctrl + W** = Close tab in a browser

**Tab** = Descend to the next selection (dur)

**Shift + Tab** = Ascend to the previous selection (also works with *Alt+Tab*)

**Ctrl + Shift + Escape** = Task Manager (thus no more control + alt + del)

__________________________________
In Word and other text editors : 

**Ctrl + E** = Align the text to the center

**Ctrl + L** = Align the text to the left

**Ctrl + R** = Align the text to the right

**Ctrl + B** = Bold text

**Ctrl + I** = Italic/Cursive

___________________________

Not really hotkeys but still:

**¶ + R** = Open Run

There you can enter the following commands :

*calc*  = Calculator

*winword* = Word

*mspaint* = Paint

*msconfig* = System configuration tool (Get rid of all those damn programs that boot along with your windows)

*appwiz.cpl* = Remove/Add programs

*ncpa.cpl* = Network adapter connections

*shutdown -s -t X*

Where **X** represents the ammount of seconds before your PC shuts down.

Feel free to add some more if you know some",self,t5_2qh1b,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/qquos/a_list_of_hotkeys_i_learned_over_the_years_that_i/

I used to say ""They'll get it together eventually""

Maybe I'm over reacting. Maybe I just need to relax. But I hate feeling like Microsoft is just shooting themselves in the foot. It's such a bad time for me too.

This is my VERY amateur write-up. So don't take anything as fact


http://i.imgur.com/KQxEb.png

This is the new home screen (UI referred to as Metro). It's left to right only, but for keyboard, it's odd. Basically, in this view you can only access ""metro"" apps (Metro apps can't run in ""windows"" they're pretty much always maximized. I believe you can view two side by side though if you have a display that supports it. My laptop, sadly does not meet the resolution requirement.. All those little icons you see will launch apps that were written for this view. 

**edit:** clarifying. You can launch any app, I Can't run Paint in Metro view. If I were to access a paint tile, it would jump into desktop mode (VERY cleanly, I should add) and load it automatically.




http://i.imgur.com/BNF3s.png

This is what you see if you swipe from right to left on the home screen (can't figure out if you can do this with a mouse or trackpad yet)

**edit:** There is a horizontal scroll on the bottom

Search will basically replace your ""all programs""





http://i.imgur.com/IMWkC.png

Clicking on Search provides this view...notice ""Apps"" is selected and I can see all my apps here. I can begin swiping / scrolling (dragging the mouse doesn't seem to work but I'm not sure if my trackpad's all set up correctly



http://i.imgur.com/yOqeb.png


Clicking on Settings lets me search the computer for settings. In this example

**edit** don't think you can pin settings to the home screen



http://i.imgur.com/gT5D7.png 

Back to the home screen, then the full blown desktop one...this is metro, and the two are handled separately. The mobile browser experience has little compromise when it comes to page rendering. Granted it has no flash support (just right now, or never? not sure. I keep hearing mobile IE will never support plugins, but not sure if that's founded or not.)



http://i.imgur.com/zsVOt.png

If I swipe from the top down (or bottom up), you see a few icons to the right of the address bar: refresh, pin (lets you rename / pin a ""tile"" to the metro desktop), and a little paper icon that clicking pops up a menu to let you either search the page or open existing page in the full blown desktop IE.



The browser itself is buttery smooth and works fantastically well from what I've seen so far. I'd love it on an actual tablet I think. (minus flash playback



http://i.imgur.com/QZs2a.jpg

On the home screen, D = show desktop, etc...Right clicking the desktop lets me do the typical stuff like change the resolution, wallpaper, arrange icons, etc...that hasn't changed.


A quick note as I write this. Going back and forth between the traditional and metro desktop

http://i.imgur.com/qyraN.jpg

This screen shows what happens if I move my mouse to the very bottom left corner 

Search pops up the search bar from earlier
Share depends on app how it works. In this example
Devices lets me output to different devices
Settings pops up an overlay on the right of your screen. Quick access panels for wifi, system notifications, power-off. I think this is standard on any screen of the UI, and app specific options if it supports them. (Very limited because of this version and lack of support.


Clicking the time and those icons by it doesn't seem to do anything

To copy text, etc...based on the application you're in. Tested it in mobile and desktop IE.

**another update**
You can't close tasks that I can tell in the metro view. You can swipe between them by swiping from the left end of the screen and cycle through one by one

You can kill apps though by launching the task manager (I pinned it to my home screen

***More random thoughts...***

It's funny, you can zoom Out / In to your heart's content. 

What I wonder is from a hardware standpoint, log out, switch users, lock device, access the task manager, and accessibility options)

I saw somewhere in the menu earlier you can update what the window key and volume up does so a bit of customization seems awesome.

What I'm perhaps most curious about is what level of access the metro apps will have to the OS compared to the desktop version. For metro apps you can't do anything akin to the ""right click -&gt; run as admin"" as far as I Can tell

I know there might be others out there that had the same concern so I figured I would share my satisfaction with the product. The scroll slider (as opposed to a wheel) even vibrates when I use it

When I was at the store just earlier considering buying it or the same model I've been using for a few years I read up on some reviews on Amazon so I'll tackle a few of the things covered there (and recommend checking out the reviews if you are interested in hearing more feedback). The clicking aka mouse buttons 1 &amp; 2 were said to be 'sticky' according to some and/or unresponsive. I haven't had any issues with this and the mouse buttons certainly feel like any other mouse buttons I've used. However, the transceiver is small enough I can just leave it plugged into my laptop at nearly all times so I don't need to worry about it.

And I'm pretty sure it's been wished into the cornfield by Microsoft. I'm not positive

And this is why it's getting harder and harder to get excited about new Microsoft products. Because if something doesn't become a huge hit overnight, or worse - left to wither and die on the vine. 

Microsoft has a disturbing habit of letting applications coast - you can download them, and sometimes questions even get answered in the forums. But there's just this feeling that nobody's actually *working* on it. There's no sense of ""wait until you see what the next version brings!"" Just that sense of impending doom. 

The Zune hardware felt like that for almost a year before the plug was officially pulled. Visio used to have an active networking mapper that stopped being mentioned until it was pulled out of the product. 

I have this haunting suspicion that Windows Media Center's days are numbered. It's been announced as a paid add-on for Windows 8. If it even ships

And Microsoft virtually never open sources products

**Overview**
To help our customers become more secure and up-to-date, Windows 7 x86 RTM and higher and Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM and higher for x64. This Blocker Toolkit is intended for organizations that would like to block automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 9 to machines in environments where Automatic Updates is enabled. The Blocker Toolkit will not expire.

**Note:**
*For computers running Windows Vista
*The Blocker Toolkit will not prevent users from manually installing Internet Explorer 9 as a Recommended update from the Windows Update or Microsoft Update sites
*Organizations do not need to deploy the Blocker Toolkit in environments managed with an update management solution such as Windows Server Update Services or Systems Management Server 2003. Organizations can use those products to fully manage deployment of updates released through Windows Update and Microsoft Update
*Even if you used the Blocker Toolkit to block Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8 from being installed as a high-priority or important update


See the ""Additional Information"" section below for detailed instructions on configuring and deploying the Blocker Toolkit. The same information is also provided in the Help file included in the download.
