* Hernandez had known the victim for about a year
* The police went to question Hernandez
* A warrant was issued to seize surveillance footage from Hernandez's home.
* Hernandez had recently installed a 14 camera system with cameras inside and out.
* Upon reviewing the footage
* at 9:02 PM Hernandez texted a friend from out of state ""please make it back""
* 9:05 he texted the victim
* 9:35 he texted the same out of state friend ""get your ass up here"" then at 10:23 ""hurry your ass up""

* At 3:07 AM the victim sent a text to his sister ""did you see who I am with"" no response he texted again at 3:11 AM ""Hello?""
* at 3:19 am his sister replied ""who?"" at 3:22 the victim texted back ""NFL"" then 1 minute later ""Just so you know""
* at the time of these texts
* Surveillance cameras show the vehicle driving down the road to the murder site at 3:23 AM
* between 3:23 and 3:27 am workers nearby hear multiple gunshots
* cameras pick up the vehicle along the route between the murder site and Hernandez's home at 3:27 and 3:28 AM.
* Hernandez's own Surveillance picks sees him arriving back home at 3:29 AM
* Police confirm it is only a 2 minute drive.
* autopsy found that all evidence was consistent with the victim being murdered where he was found. In other words

* Investigators checked out the rental car. Tire treads matched those at the crime scene. Dirt found on the car also matched the crime scene
* They found a .22 nearby in a search of everywhere between Hernandez's home and the murder site. Hernandez a month prior had been involved an altercation in providence Rhode island. He had someone with him who was seen to place a gun under a car. This man matches the description of one of his companions on the night of the murder.
* The gun under the car in Providence was traced to a Florida gun store. The 22 found between Hernandez's home and the murder site was from the same store.
* further search warrant of Hernandez's home ordered. They found 22 ammo, he doesn't have the correct paperwork to own it.
* Not recovered was the Black semi auto handgun seen in Hernandez's hand before and after the murder. the second individuals gun not found either.
* Hernandez's girlfriend was spoken to by police
* the victim had defensive wounds and seemed to attempt to stop the bullets with his arms.

there also seems to be a sealed affadavit

Another Man seems to have been arrested in connection with this case. [Carlos Ortiz](https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/350222064935899136)

EDIT: [Hernandez reportedly being looked into in a double homicide from last year](http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/22702430/2013/06/27/source-hernandez-investigated-in-boston-double-killing) No clue about the validity

[EDIT2: Full video of the arraignment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8einH-qELc)

EDIT 3: [Boston Globe reports victim may have been killed because he knew details of the double shooting Hernandez is being looked into for.
](https://twitter.com/GlobeMCramer/status/350283820353859584)

EDIT4: [Bail appeal hearing going on right now. Live video on NFL Network and ESPN](http://i.imgur.com/lNEpT0V.png?1) 

EDIT 5: apparently yesterday a warrant was issued for a condo in Hernandez's name. 3 boxes of .45 caliber ammo. Hummer registered to Hernandez outside the condo contained a magazine for a .45 handgun. Both the gun in the video seen in Hernandez's hand and the murder weapon were Glocks. 

Prosecutor: doesn't want to disclose motive that hasn't already been made public

again references conversation in the car with the victim on the night of the murder. Hernandez indicates he is angry with the victim for talking to people Hernandez doesn't like at the club. Doesn't think he can trust him. 
""Hernandez had the motive and he was the one in control""

Sites [this image (I assume it's this image)](http://i.imgur.com/MfjGYqD.jpg) as an example of what the murder weapon would look like

Judge: evidence circumstantial for sure

**BAIL DENIED**

EDIT 6: [Police impound an SUV that may connect Hernandez to 2012 double murder](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/06/27/cops-impound-suv-that-may-connect-hernandez-to-2012-killings/)

EDIT 7: [Police release wanted poster of 3rd suspect.](http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/22708728/2013/06/27/police-release-wanted-poster-in-connection-to-odin-lloyds-murder) wanted as an accomplice after the fact. last seen in a silver Chrysler 300 (which is what Hernandez rented when they turned in the car used during the murder)

As the clock winded down, they caught him shaking the hand of the joyous Alex Smith. ""Congrats!"" said Aaron as their eyes locked. Smith pulled Rodgers in closer. ""You played well."" Smith whispered. 

Aaron walked into the steamy locker room and began to undress. His gigantic dong flopped out of his uniform. A thundering bang was heard when it slapped against his leg. He hopped in the shower and began to cleanse himself of sweat and dirt. After his shower

Aaron said his goodbyes to team mates and coaches and walked to his car. As he approached his car, a hand wrapped around his mouth and said, ""Don't make a sound."" As he began to panic, the hand pulled away and Aaron could hear laughter. Alex Smith was on the ground laughing. Aaron looked shocked. ""Alex, you asshole!"" He then playfully slapped Alex. ""Sorry, I couldn't help it!"" The two embraced each other and began to kiss slowly. Alex whispered, ""I'm sorry that I beat your ass on the field and now I am going to beat your ass in your backseat."" 

Aaron began to unzip Alex's pants. He grabbed his monstrous pecker and began to move his hand up and down. ""Oh yeah, take it you little bitch."" Aaron kept taking the dick into his hairy asshole. ""Fuck me harder!"" Alex pumped away. Aaron could feel his penis begin to swell. Within minutes, Alex blew his gigantic load inside Aaron's tight little butt hole. ""Well, I hope I see you in the post season."" whispered Alex. 

Ok fuck that

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

* Going into 2012, and without head Coach Sean Payton for the season, the season had a very surreal air to it.

* There were also several other notable suspensions, with the exception of Loomis, Payton and Vitt, these suspensions would be lifted.  Offensive line coach Aaron Kromer was the Saints interim head coach the first 6 games of the season.

* The Saints season was one that was filled with ups and downs.  After starting 0-4, the Saints dropped 3 straight to the 49ers, the Falcons and the Giants.  Sitting at 5-8, all fans could hope for was a .500 season.  After trouncing the Bucs 41-0, the Saints defeated the Cowboys in a nail-biter.  However, at 7-8 the Saints fell to the Carolina Panthers, capping a disappointing 7-9 season.

**Highs**

* The Saints didn't really experience their first high until Week 5.  Against the San Diego Chargers in a sold out Superdome, allowing them to go into their bye week with momentum.

* Coming off the bye

* The Saints Week 9 defeat of Philadelphia may seem insignificant, a huge weight off the shoulders of Drew Brees.

* Week 10 proved to be the pinnacle of the Saints 2012 season.  The 8-0 Atlanta Falcons came to town looking to establish their dominance in the NFC South.  It turned into an exciting battle between two of the best Tight Ends in the game (calm down Pats fans, the latter picking up the 100th touchdown of his illustrious career.  Chris Ivory also returned with a bang, running for a 56 yard touchdown that would ultimately swing the momentum in the Saints favor.  With a little over a minute left, the Saints defense had another divisional goal line stop, with Matt Ryan's pass to Roddy White being broken up by Jabari Greer.  The Saints had dethroned the last undefeated team in the NFL, and that would ultimately prove to be the biggest bright spot in a trying 2012 season.

* In the second quarter of a Week 12 match-up against San Francisco, thus surpassing long time fan favorite Deuce McAllister for the most touchdowns in franchise history.

**Lows**

* The Saints saw their biggest lows before the season began.  After they were incriminated in the infamous Bounty Gate scandal

* After a tough two losses to the Redskins and Panthers, however, ravaged the Saints defense for 21 unanswered points, and the Saints eventually lost 27-24 in overtime.  This loss was heartbreaking in itself, but in addition it was at the hands of a team that didn't have a lead until Week 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers (sorry Chiefs fans).

* The Saints were able to get to 5-5 going into Week 12 by winning 5 of 6 games.  However, Atlanta Falcons (again) and New York Giants in 3 straight weeks.  It was a chance for the Saints to prove that they could still roll with the big boys despite their woes of the season.  But the Saints lost all 3, with Brees throwing 9 of his league leading 19 interceptions in those 3 games.

* Despite the fact that I mentioned the Falcons game, Brees came out and threw an astounding 5 interceptions in a 23-13 loss.  Atlanta controlled the tempo of the game throughout despite losing the TOP battle by about 7 minutes: (New Orleans: 33:44 ; Atlanta: 26:16).  Atlanta maintained a 5.4 yards per carry rush average, and ultimately the turnovers killed the Saints.  To add insult to injury, the Falcons avenged their undefeated season by bringing Drew Brees' consecutive games with a TD record to a halt at 54 games.

* But wait, and thus broke the single season record for yards allowed in a season at 7,042.  The team that they surpassed?  The 1981 Baltimore Colts.  Let that sink in.  The Saints record also dropped to 7-9, and their hopes to at least salvage a .500 season were dashed.

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

* The Saints main positional needs are on defense

    * Outside Linebacker
  
    * Cornerback

    * Offensive Line (Namely LT and C).

* This part is tricky since a lot of restructuring needs to happen before the Saints can even begin to look at Free Agency options.  They're about $15 million in the hole in terms of cap space (only the Jets &amp; Cowboys are worse off), so Mickey Loomis will likely try to focus on keeping his own Free Agents in house.

* In the first round of the draft, New Orleans will likely pick up Dion Jordan out of Oregon, who is a good open field tackler, something that the Saints sorely lacked last year.  Jordan's conversion to OLB from DE will be relatively painless, since Oregon often dropped him into coverage last year as well.

**Final Thoughts**

* Despite the circus that was the 2012 season, the New Orleans Saints and their fans look forward to putting 2012 behind them and starting anew come 2013.

For those that don't know me, wide receiver and running back. I also played point guard and shooting guard for our basketball team. I received offers to play both football and basketball in college, but decided to continue with football.  Graduated in the fall semester of 2011.  I was drafted by the Detroit Lions as the 54th overall pick.

**Sample rules:**

* Each team must in the first round take a player from their own team.
Example: /r/minnesotavikings must take a Viking. Why? If you're a Vikings fan and your subreddit's team doesn't have a single Viking

* Each team can only draft 1 QB.
Why? It is very likely only 32 QBs are going to play each week. QB hogging ruins fun.

* Each team must draft their own defense
Why? Because most likely we will be watching our home team and this makes it so people are more invested. (Not 100% of this one)


EDIT: Wow this seems to be taking off. I'm glad people like it! If anyone is interested in actually putting this together message me and I will try to get your username up here.


EDIT2: Seems like a 32 team league would just be too difficult. It looks like 2

If you guys aren't aware

Us mods are currently discussing the pros and cons of this feature and would think that it could be ripe for experimentation. As you may guess, is because it could help in avoiding bandwagon/circlejerk type comments reaching the top of comment heaps and providing other multiple child comments as well. As we all know, non-bias is a big part of this sub reddit as we all follow 32 different types of teams. This means fairness and equality are pretty darn important.

We mods always have the best interest at heart when making any changes so we went to present this to you to gauge how you would feel on this subject.

With regards to the Redskins possible rename

The reasons for this are as follows:

* The argument itself has been absolutely beaten into the ground in this sub

(Here are the two points: Point 1: It's not racist. Point 2: It's racist

* There's no ""debating""

* The threads regarding the name all devolve into name calling and racial slurs being thrown about constantly

* It's a political topic, if and when the team changes it's name, we will obviously want to have discussion regarding that, but at this time there is no apparent end in sight for this debate.

Due to the above reasons, or the subject is dropped for good.*

Now onto our results. Sit back

- in 2 days we had 3006 survey takers
- The average respondent loves 1.5 teams, dislikes 5.6 teams, and hates 4.2 teams
- The average team had 151 loves, 531 dislikes and 397 hates
- 13 respondents love their team and hate every other team.

""Score"" - the score is the averaging of the results. It counts hates as -2, likes as 1, and loves as 2, then divides by total responses. Scores range from -2 to 2. -2 is pure hate, 2 is pure love, 0 is balanced.

- The average score was -.15 which means people were more negative than positive.
- 13 people scored the lowest -1.85
- 2208 people scored negatively (rating more teams hates/dislikes than like/loves)
- 177 people scored 0 (balancing the amount of hates/dislikes with likes/loves)
- 663 people were positive (more likes/loves)
- 11 teams scored positively (more people gave them likes/loves than hates/dislikes) : Bills, Bengals, Niners, Vikings, Browns, Seahawks, Redskins

**The CHART!!!** Here's the /r/NFL version of that baseball chart :

- [Sorted by score](http://i.imgur.com/WTPE6.png)
- [Sorted by love](http://i.imgur.com/kZVW4.png)
- [Sorted by love+like](http://i.imgur.com/y0xeL.png)
- [Sorted by indifference](http://i.imgur.com/7Tgmk.png)

- [Sorted by hate](http://i.imgur.com/kIil0.png)
- [As a vertical bar chart instead of a horizontal stacked] (http://i.imgur.com/MiAVD.png)
 
So congrats to Houston for being the best liked team (by score). Seattle got the most loved. Dallas most hated. Jets worst overall opinion (lowest scored).

[Here's a chart showing each division summed together

**The Fans**

For simplicity

[A table of fan opinions of other teams](http://i.imgur.com/tdBwH.png) Red = negative

If you don't want to look at a bunch of numbers

- The only fanbase to not have a negative score against New England is Arizona (scored 0)
- The only fanbase to score Houstan negatively are Titans fans
- The only fanbase to score the Bengals negatively were the other AFC north teams. The only fanbase to score the Browns negatively were the Steelers fans.
- The only fanbases to score Washington negatively are other NFC East teams.
- Tampa Bay is only disiked by the NFC South and NFC East
- The only fanbases who dislike the Vikings are the other NFC North teams.
- Every fanbase dislikes the Jets
- Your opinion of a team is more based on what team it is and less about who your team is.

**FAN CHARTS**

Fan Positivity : [This chart](http://i.imgur.com/N0pIB.png) shows the average score of how fans of one team scored all the other teams. From it you can see that Chiefs

**Fan Rivalry**

To get a measure of rivalries, so we'll keep it simple). This simple method should make sense, as if team A rates team B -1 and B rates A -1 their score is -2 which since both fans don't like each other we'll call that a rivalry. If A rates B -1, and B rates A 1, add them together = 0 - which isn't much of a rivalry as not both teams are competitive against each other.

[Here's a table of the rivalries](http://i.imgur.com/djMkT.png).  I highlighted scores less than -2 as Black - which are the biggest rivalries. Scores less than -1 are highlighted Red - which are pretty good rivalries. And scores greater than one are highlighted blue aren't rivalries but more ""friends"" (each team has a 4 next to themselves because 2+2).

Once again if you don't want to look at a wall of numbers here are some key points

- NE v. NYJ biggest 'rivalry' scoring -3.11
- Other big rivalries are : NE v. MIA (-2.7), BAL v. PIT (-2.58), DAL v. PIT (-2.32), NYG v. NE (-2.39), NO v. ATL (-2.41), GB v CHI (-2.67), DAL v. NYG (-3), DAL v. WAS (-2.6)
- There are 53 other rivalries which scored less then -1 (but greater than -2)
- Since there are 512 'match-ups' between teams
- There are 4 ""friends"" : Denver and Houston (+1.66) Broncos and Colts (+1.59) &lt;- who would think the two horse teams would band together (and I know, and Niners and Ravens (+1.1) &lt;- Harbros!!!

Edit : As requested- the largest asymmetries between two teams (biggest difference between what two teams think of each other)

- Seahawks and Steelers (1.7 difference)
- Jets and Texans (1.57 difference)
- Redskins and Steelers (1.47 difference)
- Jets and Denver (1.46 difference)
- Broncos and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Bills and Cowboys (1.37 difference)
- Texans and Steelers (1.31 difference)

1353284154.0,13f8cn,I'm a Browns fan and I just need to vent,require_once,1699,373,644,"Warning: the following rant is a massive load of pessimism and self pity. Browns fans under the age of 18 should seek parental permission before reading.

I was born in a Cleveland hospital in 1985. I don't remember the drive, who I thought they called ""Vinny-testing-Bernie"", a sort of interim player only intended to re-light Bernie's spark. In my young mind Bernie Kosar always was and always would be the Cleveland quarterback.

I remember when Art Modell became the devil incarnate after it was announced that the Browns were moving to Baltimore. I remember sitting around in silence

I remember watching every game of the 1999 season, no matter who puts on the coach's headset, they always act like the Cleveland Browns. Even the medical staff has not been immune to performing ""Browns-ian"".

We made the playoffs in 2002, and while that team was exciting to watch we were still making the same Browns mistakes: losing to a bad Raiders team, not picking up a win over the Steelers, and Derek Anderson throwing two awful interceptions just before halftime against the Bengals resulting in a loss, to a team that we were clearly better than, and missing the playoffs.

It has been thirteen years of the media treating us like the Washington Generals, of unfavorable officiating (bottlegate still gets on my nerves).

Most fans know what it feels like to have an awful season, and then doing it again after the 2007 ACLS. You also have a basketball team that finds a savior only to see him fail in the biggest moments and then turn his back on the people who worshiped him.

You all know the history, it doesn't have remarkable shopping or live shows. The summers are too hot, the winters are too slushy and gross, and the other seasons are mostly cloudy. Cleveland has the “Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!” which is good for a few hours of entertainment every few years.

Do you know why I warned incoming Cleveland fans of the pessimism and self-pity contained herein? It's because the entire city is awash with it

I moved away as soon as I finished high school. I've lived in Packer country for the past eight years, the Browns were plastered all over the newspaper, and all his new friends and co-workers were Browns fans. I have not followed suite to become a Packers fan because Sunday Ticket, Redzone, and internet streams and blogs have allowed me to continue to follow my home team in a way that my father's generation never could. I telecommute for work. My boss lives in sunny California and couldn't care less about football. My friends are Packers fans, and Bears, and Lions

You want a guaranteed get rich scheme? Imagine heartbreaking scenarios for Cleveland sports fans

The Browns have a new owner and will soon undergo yet another reboot. We'll have new coaches, Y, and Z reasons why this is not reasonable, why the Browns can't continue to suck forever, and a lot of those will be the same reasons that I've heard since way back when Bernie was benched. I don't know if it's a league wide conspiracy to keep the Browns down, or a function of the attitude that pervades the city, or the will of God himself but there is something out there in the cosmos that is causing all this pain and until that relents I will continue to regard myself as an idiot for watching those orange-helmeted sportsmen every Sunday.

What's worse is the time I devote to reading Browns blogs, because we've been here before. We know how this story ends. Now that the season is completely meaningless I'm sure we'll pick up a couple more unimpressive wins, just enough to knock our draft position down out of the top tier talent.

After the Browns came back

I don't know what my point is with all this. I guess I'm just spent. Sorry guys.

**tl;dr:** I'm a Browns fan.

***2012 Season Analysis***

---

**General**

* The Chiefs came in under expectations this year
* The Offense was stagnant
* The one bright spot on the offense was Jamaal Charles
* The Defense played well considering the circumstances
* The Defense also recorded 4 pro bowlers
* The Special Teams was one of the only special things about the Chiefs this year

**High Points**

* Jamaal Charles is the big one here. Jamaal had 5.3 YPC, which ties the NFL record for most in a season. Many people also forget he is also coming off a season ending ACL injury just like AD. Jamaal is the one constant thing in a Chiefs offense, other than the O-Line, full of disappointments and failures.
* The O-Line did play well despite losing Center Rodney Hudson during the beginning games of the year. Ryan Lilja did fill fine moving from Guard to Center
* The Defense still has a lot of talent, who had another All-Pro caliber year; along with Brandon Flowers, who played well despite having a few injuries and not having a solid CB2 half the year.. Add in Eric Berry and the Defense is stacked with talent, and performed well considering the terrible offense on the other side of the ball.
* Dontari Poe played well in his rookie year, but he is showing promise on the Defensive Line as of now.
* The Carolina Game was probably the most inspiring thing I've ever seen
* The only other win of the year, but it was nothing to write home about.
* I'll just call all the Front Office changes good, and the coaches they brought in all seem ready and dedicated.
* [This](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1555617/garoreturns.gif) play also made my year.

**Low Points**

* Just to get this out of the way, but was a terrible, terrible tragedy. 
* All the games were bad
* Another embarrassing game was the one against the Colts, and lost to the Andrew Luck led Colts 20-13. You needed further proof the Chiefs need a QB? There it is.
* Onto the players, though, to give them a pass for this year they had no QB and the Offensive Coordinator was atrocious. 
* Matt Cassel/Brady Quinn are obviously not the answer at QB. The rushing game for the Chiefs was 5th in the league while passing was dead last, the Chiefs barely have quality back up on their roster.
* Brian Daboll is not a good Offensive Coordinator. His demeanor is childish, and I pray none of you ever get him as your Offensive Coordinator.
* Romeo Crennel is a nice guy, it was too late. He had lost the team, and he had no clue what he was doing. One press conference when asked why Jamaal Charles only got 5 carries, he said, ""I don't know.""
* Scott Pioli's has had few success stories here, and sticking with him so long was Pioli's downfall. It says a lot when the 3rd highest all time post on /r/kansascitychiefs is news of Scott Pioli getting fired.

---

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

---
*QB, Geno Smith, Tyler Wilson, or another QB in the draft.*

The Chiefs obviously need a QB, but there isn't that much info coming from the front office on this one. I can tell you a lot of people do not want Alex in KC, as many see him as Matt Cassel 2.0. I would bet $100 that every time between now and the draft if you tune into a KC sports talk show, they will be arguing over whether to take a QB at #1 overall. I do not know if the Chiefs should or not, but the desire for a franchise QB is ever present for the fans of the Chiefs.

*Offensive Line, one of the few FA T and Guards.*

It's hard to predict who will resign right now regarding Free Agents, that is a good sign they will draft Joeckel, so one can see that they will have a solid LT no matter what. Guard is a position that needs to be addressed while also adding depth there and at Center. 

*Inside Linebacker, Danelle Ellerbee, Mid Round Pick in Draft.*

Belcher left a hole to the left of Derrick Johnson, Leroy Hill, or Dannell Ellerbe, or any others, for it won't take a star to round out the linebacking core for the Chiefs. Note, **I am purely speculating with this**, but anything is, better than what they have at ILB

### Game Threads

Everybody loves game threads. They are what make any sports related subreddit great. However, under the ""Misc."" category, there is a guide to [creating game threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/help/faqs/NFL#Gamethreads).

Just a couple of points we want to make clear about the game threads however. Any bias show in the game thread post itself is not allowed. You must wait until an hour before the game starts to post a game thread. Please check the new tab before posting your game thread

**We're still just getting used to it ourselves, it will take you to a website that adds comments as they come. It's not without its flaws, ~~especially a lack of flair~~ it does include flair now though, but it is an interesting new way to keep up to the minute and not miss anything.**

**Also

-----

### Flair Up And Join Your Team's Sub!

If you don't have flair already

Then, very few were active, now many of them are. The rest will likely follow suit over the next year.

-----

### Official Threads

There are a few threads that we will make weekly. Unofficial versions of these threads were allowed during the offseason

**TRASH TALK threads** will be posted every Thursday around noon, or whatever you want. Normal posting guidelines are relaxed so don't take anything personally and don't let it spill out into the rest of r/nfl. If there is a special case that needs attention, let us know.

**Complain About Your Team threads** will be posted on Tuesday around noon

**Power Ranking threads are posted by Sevsquad every Tuesday. Any of the power rankings that are included in that post are subject to be removed if posted by other users. This is just a measure to prevent clutter and he does a great job of doing it in a timely and easy to follow manner.**

**We are temporarily shelving the Gif/Pic/Request thread until we've decided on a better way to implement it. In the meantime we will have very high standards in allowing gif and pic posts through so as not to let them overrun the sub. If you post a Gif or Pic and it is removed

-----

### Posting Guidelines

If you haven't already

As a reminder

Memes, and other content lacking in relevance or quality will be removed, as will ""joke"" posts of any kind. Feel free to post them at /r/nflcirclejerk or /r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu as you see fit.

**Specifically, etc.**

**We are moving away from satire posts. The problem is that even though there are occasionally ones which are actually funny or poignant, and clutter the sub significantly. This is a work in progress for us and we don't have the specific parameters laid out just yet. They are welcome in /r/nflcirclejerk and /r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu, which we expect to grow significantly.**

**Do not post to /r/nfl from your own blog. There is now a subreddit specifically directed at user operated blogs, the majority is lacking significantly. We can't make exceptions. If your blog is good enough, people will find it and post it to /r/nfl without your direct involvement. That's how this has to work.**

**Madden related posts will now be subject to removal. /r/madden is now an active sub and again

Please, don't downvote users based on flair. We know it's tempting to downvote a fan of a division rival who said something you don't agree with, but try not to. It stifles conversation. Also, reserve your downvotes for comments that do not add to the discussion or are off-topic. Just because someone thinks your team isn't likely to win a specific game or you think they are underrating your QB, don't downvote them. Tell them why you disagree, or upvote someone else who has already expressed your opinion. Be liberal with your upvotes r/nfl. They may have no redeeming value in real life, but it creates a much better environment for debate with fewer petty insults.

Finally, and quality pictures for the sidebar every week. Believe it or not, most of the significant pictures from the week are ones we've already seen and are discussing. If you think there's one we probably haven't seen, there is a link on the sidebar for submitting sidebar pics to us for consideration, please use that instead.",Look here!,False,t5_2qmg3,True

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

* Before training camp, hopefully leaving him more prepared for the season. Secondly, GM Rick Spielman did what was widely considered a very good job in the draft, fleecing Cleveland while moving back one spot and still getting Matt Kalil, their target and then trading back up to the first round to pick Harrison Smith to help what was an abysmal secondary. He also picked up two WRs in the 4th round, who, along with free agent signings Jerome Simpson and John Carlson, and reports on Adrian Peterson claiming he was ahead of schedule
* During training camp, who filled in acceptably for Peterson after his injury the previous year, was expected to be the main back for the start of the season. Meanwhile, two receiving targets distinguished themselves in training camp: Kyle Rudolph, a second year TE, and Greg Childs, a 2012 4th round WR. Unfortunately, and missed the entire 2012 season. Something that surprised fans was when the Vikings cut longtime K Ryan Longwell in favor of rookie 6th rounder Blair Walsh. Longwell had lost some range over the years
* In the first game of the season, but everyone expected Toby Gerhart to get most of the carries. We were wrong, as Peterson rushed for 84 yards and 2 TDs about 8 months after having surgery to repair a torn ACL and MCL. The Vikings had the lead late in the game, but gave it up with about 30 seconds to go. Ponder was able to successfully lead the team down the field to let Walsh kick a 55 yard FG to tie the game, and subsequently kick the game-winner in OT. This validated the front office’s choice to let Longwell go and trust the rookie kicker.
* In the third game of the season, and fans became very optimistic about the future of the team. It should also be noted that Percy Harvin was shaping up as the star of the Vikings offense, as his ability to make people miss made him nearly impossible to cover on screen plays.
* After beating both Detroit and Tennessee, played poorly in their next stretch of games, losing 5 of 7 and leading many fans to call for Joe Webb to replace him. Losing Harvin to injury against the Seahawks in week 9 only magnified their problems, as Ponder could hardly do anything passing without him. That’s when Adrian Peterson put the team on his back.
* Starting in week 7, averaging over 164 yards/game. When you see how poorly the Vikings played in the passing game during that stretch, you realize that Peterson was facing teams that *knew* he was going to run. Couple that with the fact that he had had major reconstructive knee surgery less than a year before, and he looks superhuman.
* Ponder picked up his play a little, or lose and go home for the offseason. Peterson was 207 yards from the single season rushing record. In a thrilling game that didn’t see much defense, the Vikings had the ball at the end of the game, with the score tied. At the Packers 37, just inside FG range, with 23 seconds to go, Peterson ripped off a 26 yard run to set up an easy game winning field goal
* The Vikings faced the Packers again the next week in the Wild Card round, would start instead. Webb [played terribly](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1959123/matthewsack.gif), making [numerous poor decisions](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1958919/ohwebb.gif) and [throwing wildly](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1958899/lolwebb.gif), and the Vikings lost, 24-10.

**Highs**

* Peterson’s [amazing comeback](http://cdn3.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1267619/allday.gif). He finished second all time on the single season rushing list, still rushing for almost 500 yards.
* Percy Harvin [played amazingly well](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1510369/harvinHOF.gif) in the first half of the season
* Blair Walsh set a NFL record for field goals over 50 yards
* The wins weeks 3 and 17 against the 49ers and Packers
* Preventing the Texans from scoring a TD week 16
* Peterson, Jerome Felton, Matt Kalil, and Chad Greenway making the Pro Bowl. Rudolph was Pro Bowl MVP.
* Harrison Smith’s and Antoine Winfield’s roles in a much improved secondary.
* The Vikings went 4-2 in the NFC North. They were 0-6 last season
* Going 4-0 the last 4 games of the season against the most difficult schedule in the NFL.
* The offensive line really meshed
* Jared Allen had a slightly down year

**Lows**

* The 7 game stretch that saw 5 losses
* Jasper Brinkley played really poorly at MLB
* Bill Musgrave’s playcalling decisions were often questionable at best
* The Wild Card game: Webb’s poor performance showed that he is simply not capable of being an NFL QB.
* Drama surrounding Percy Harvin. During the offseason, Harvin injured his ankle and because frustrated with his slow recovery. He eventually blew up and got into an argument with Leslie Fraiser, the head coach, resulting in his placement on Injured Reserve. Recently, it has been reported that the Vikings are looking to trade Harvin and that Harvin will hold out if he does not get a new contract. However, GM Rick Spielman has publicly stated he does not want to trade Harvin. Fans can only hope to get a resolution to this conflict soon, as Harvin is an extremely talented player.

For a hometown example, Reggie, and/or Sean Smith, I would want our draft broad to look much different than if we didn't have those moves happen.

1359139929.0,179pdq,"What do Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, and Matt Schaub have in common? They all have at least seven times the average rush yards per game of Dan Marino. But Marino is only second least of all time, who has the least? Find out in in today's Salute to the Worst Running QBs of All Time.",LinuxFreeOrDie,245, Cam Newton, unathletic white guys standing in the pocket and trying desperately to find the open man even though there are 20 yards of open grass in front of them.

It's true, he never would have made it, Matt Giordano closes on him in seconds, he looks literally twice as fast as Schaub. We all know how fleet of foot [Peyton Manning](http://i.imgur.com/2ENvk.png) is.

So while it seems like everyone is drafting QBs who can make people miss in the open field, has *five times* had an individual season where he out ran Dan Marino's career mark. So today, while we stand perhaps on the verge of a new era of athletes under center, let us look back with pride at some of the slowest, most clumsy playcallers of all time.

We'll look at the three slowest, including a 76 yard touchdown run earlier this year. But before there was RGIII - there was Steve Bono. For those who don't remember, Steve Bono was best known as Joe Montana's backup. He backed him and / or Young from 1989-1993 in SF. He was then traded to KC to once again backup Montana. Unlike Montana and Young however he was known as a slow footed pocket statue, rushing for a paltry 2.9 yards per game (Peyton has 3.3 for comparison).

Despite all that, because while it's true Bono had yet to run a single bootleg up until that point in the year, they might have wanted to cover it a little better than that. According to a Sports Illustrator interview, Bono had a feeling how well they would be fooled though [\[1\]](http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2009/6/26/925978/the-greatest-kansas-city-chiefs-by):

&gt;Even more amazing than the run was what Bono had said in the huddle after receiving the play from the sideline. Convinced that the play-action bootleg would burn Cardinal coach Buddy Ryan's aggressive defense, told his stunned teammates, ""Guys, I'm taking it to the house.""

So Steve Bono

Alright, Dan Marino, who might have had the quickest release and the slowest legs ever. Although he was actually [named #7 on NFL Network's top 10 mobile QBs of all time](http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story?id=09000d5d8089c108&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true), due his great ability to move around and avoid pressure, Dan Marino is often thought of as the prototype of a pure passer. Dan Marino passed for 61,361 yards (2nd all time), and yet he only managed to get 87 rushing yards in his entire 17 year career. That's an astounding 728:1 ratio, but in comparison he has a 66:1 passing to rushing ratio, but even with that the odds are pretty low of witnessing the rarest of rare Dan Marino rushing yard. There's move video of Bigfoot on youtube than Dan Marino running. So Dan Marino, for you to only zip the ball downfield for a longer pass than you would have gotten if you took off.

Next up at number two: Ken Stabler. Now, I was able to find a pretty good run by him in [the Immaculate Reception game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Fbca0EncfW4#t=11s), and while he doesn't exactly look like Cam Newton, he moves pretty well. But he has to be included due to his incredible career rushing stats. That 30 yard run was by far his longest, and in fact not counted in his rushing stats since it happened in the playoffs. In the regular season he only ever managed to rush for 93 yards in 13 years, 0.5 a game. Now on the surface those stats look better than Marino's, but the really incredible thing about Stabler's stats is that out of those 93 yards, if you remove 1973 Ken Stabler had -8 career rushing yards, with not a single year in the positive

And now, and lead two teams to championships, the Rams in 1951 and the Eagles in 1960 (the Eagle's most recent, maybe they should go back to pocket passers!). But Norman Van Brocklin is perhaps best known for passing for a record 554 yards in a single game, a record that incredibly still stands today. And yet in his 13 year career he only amassed 40 rushing yards, an incredible 0.3 per game. That means he passed for 13.85 times more yards in a single game than he ran for in his entire career. Clearly The Dutchman didn't think running was in his job description, Sonny Jurgensen even has an anecdote about Norman yelling at him for trying to run in the NFL Films piece. Wikipedia says this about his coaching career:

&gt;On January 18, preferring that he stay in the pocket.

All in all, and perhaps the purest pocket passer ever. You set the template for slow footed, terrible athletes to succeed in the NFL for generations to come!

Thank you to those who posts game threads, those who spirit civil and well mannered discussions, and those who posts excellent content to /r/nfl. 11 months ago, we were celebrating 40k users. Now, we are nearly up to 140k and it's because of you guys. From the preseason to post season and beyond

I'd also like to thank you for making superbowl sunday so quiet. Of course we removed threads which didn't belong

###Questions and Anwsers

Many people have questions about the offseason and /r/nfl. We'll try our best to answer them here.

**What do we normally discuss here during the offseason?**

The offseason might not be as exciting as the regular season, free agency, combine, the draft and more, there is plenty to post and discuss.

**Now that there is no more NFL

Outside of other sports, which will have a lot of discussion about the upcoming NFL draft.

**When will the flair un-fade?**

We un-fade all the flair at the draft. The Baltimore Ravens trophy flair will stay until training camp


Edit: In the interest of fairness we'll be removing the Lombardi trophy from Ravens flair at the start of the NFL draft

***2012 Season Analysis***
***
**General**

*Preseason*

•	The major offseason move for the Bills was the major FA signings on d-line.  We signed Mario Williams to a six-year, we also picked up Mark Anderson from the Patriots following his 10 sack break out season.  He signed a four-year, $19.5 million contract with $8 million guaranteed.  When paired with Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams, the Bills were heading into the season with one of the most hyped up defensive lines of the entire league.
  
•	In the draft the Bills were able to truly shore up some positions of need.  The team, the team was in dire need of some talent at the position.  So they drafted Stephon Gilmore who took the starting #1 corner position coming out of training camp.  Along with Gilmore, Cordy Glenn fell into the Bills lap during the 2nd round.  Buddy Nix was quoted as saying, “Hell no he’s not a guard.. He started 50 games and the last 16 were at left tackle. We put it out there and tried to spread the rumour that he was a guard to hope somebody wouldn’t take him.""  It was phenomenal pick for the team that needed one more piece in the o-line to really come together as a good unit.  Our third round pick was the project TJ Graham.  Considered a deep threat with some extreme raw talent, TJ ran track in College and was supposed to stretch the field for the Bills to allow Stevie Johnson to work the middle where he is most effective.  Following Graham was Nigel Bradahm.  He was a middle linebacker at FSU who is hard and brutal hitter.  [Bonus vicious yet legal hit at FSU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MGYwJaqIzLU#t=83s)  Finally in the 5th round the Bills took Ron Brooks, a kid who sat behind Morris Claiborne and Patrick Peterson for 3 years at LSU.  Talk about a bad break, but he slid to the Bills here.  The rest of the picks had no impact on the team except for our 7th round Kicker Josh Potter who was released after 6 games -_-

•	We signed Vince Young but cut him after it was found out he owed lots of money and took out loans to throw $300

•	The addition of the highly hyped Dave Wannstedt as our new Defensive Coordinator, Mark Anderson, Dareus, Kyle Williams, Nick Barnett, and Jarius Byrd the Bills defense finally looked like it was ready for a break out year.  We could not have been more wrong (I place the blame on a miserable washed up coach whose scheme did nothing to maximize anything).  On the offensive side of the ball, the Bills were looking to make the big step forward; Fitz had a full offseason under his belt as the starter.  Stevie had help on the outside
•	We had hope.  
***

*The 2012 Season review*

• Jets 48 – Bills 28 All hope was lost.  Fred Jackson out for at least 6 games with a knee injury and Mark Sanchez stat line: 19-27 3 TD 1 Int.  [Abandon season]( http://i.imgur.com/L08ao.gif)


•	The chiefs and browns wins were rather empty knowing we had to face the Patriots and 49ers. But CJ Spiller was our [bright spot](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-fantasy/0ap2000000065339/QB-Fitzpatrick-to-RB-Spiller-32-yd-pass-TD) He was the first player to average at least 10  per carry through the first two games since Jim Brown.  Then against the Browns


•	I will pretend that I blacked out the next two weeks.  We lost 28-52 to the Patriots and 45-3 to the 49ers. 


•	One note of importance- the Bills were up 7-21 during the 3rd quarter.  The Pats proceeded to put up 45 points following that along with some [vacuum pizzas]( http://i.imgur.com/nGnNy.gif) when the score was tied. 


•	Who are the 49ers?


•	On to the Arizona OT win


•	In Arizona


•	Matt Hassleback contemplating retirement leads his team to victory in with a dominant drive to put the Titans up by 1 for the win.  I hate life.


•	Our defense decides that stopping the run is optional for these few weeks, 182 and then 197 to the Pats, 49ers, Cardinals and Titans. My head explodes during bye week wondering if life is better as a Houston Oilers fan.  


•	We lose to the Texans and Patriots again.  Over the past 4 games CJ has 12, 9 carries respectively.  WOW this guy must suck right he must have a negative yards per average rush to be earning such little carries. Oh, he had a 7.33, 5.83, 6.50 and 7.78 Y/A.  It was here that most people moved on from Chan as a head coach.  He couldn’t manage a game and insisted on Brad Smith at crucial points of the game.  Brad would come in, throw a pick or lose yards.  The amount of talent on both sides of the ball here is more than average but Dave Wanny and Chan wasted it with embarrassing game plans and an inability to be aggressive.  


•	The Bills are a 3-6 with a near impossible schedule to start the season.  But starting with Miami the Bills had a supposed much easier schedule and were looking to run the table.   They are facing Miami, Rams, Seattle, Miami again, and finally the Jets, who following the offensive dysentery they had on us, opening day


•	We beat Miami on Thursday Night Football.  I got blackout drunk at the stadium.  It was a blast.  Leodis McKelvin saved our butts with the only Bills touchdown


•	We face Andrew Luck.  It should be the CJ show.  He had 25 touches in Miami with 125 total yards and it looks like Chan is finally recognizing the keys to winning.  In Indy, then Stevie comes up and strips the fella who picked off the ball and we get it back.  The ball is on the 50 and things are looking great for us to tie it up, 4 minutes left.  1st down, Fitz gets 6 on a QB run. 2-4, Chan calls his 800th screen of the day we lose 4 yards.  We throw it again on 3-8, incomplete; Fitz wouldn’t be able to hit water if he was skipping stones into Lake Erie. We punt on the 50 yard line and Luck runs out the clock. Game Lost.


•	We beat the Jags ^whooooooooooo 


•	If the Arizona game was Fitz and Chan’s downfall, puke yellow is Fitz touching the ball and puke green is Freddy touching the ball.  [Offensive Plays](http://i.imgur.com/6gbxMl5.png)


•	We lose 17-50 to the Seahawks our old defense shows up =) Beast Mode


•	Why did I volunteer to do this? 


•	We lose to Miami in miserable fashion.  Watching the offense is offensive. It looks nice with lots of CJ but checking the series ending downs you’ll see the true story.  Let me lay it out: 

o	2 Incompletions

After trying this in some of the most popular thread types we'll see during the season and observing and discussing the outcomes, we have concluded that vote hiding has had no substantial effect on the types of comments that are being posted or voted to the top. We've considered merely shortening the time, but with specific deference to the nature of game threads, we have chosen to remove it.

**2012 Season Preview**

After an amazing 15-1 regular season and an abrupt exit from the 2011 playoffs hopes were definitely high for the 2012 Packers.  The main failing of last years team

There were two departures in Free agency betwen these seasons that really affected the Packers.  First and foremost was center Scott Wells

Green Bay also addressed the lack of a running game with the off-season signing of Cedric Benson.  The deal heavily favored Green Bay as Benson was signed to a one year deal at the veteran minimum.  Benson was not quite what Green Bay was hoping for as he averaged either 2.0 YPC or 4.0 YPC (with good games coming against New Orleans and Chicago).  He was enough of a threat to keep the defenses honest (after week 1) but in the week 5 game against the Colts he suffered a season ending Lisfranc injury.

**Highs**

* Aaron Rodgers continuing dominace.  It's still a surprise when he throws an interception and it seems more often than not it's not his fault when it does happen.  He did see his passer rating drop from the record 122.5 last season to a paltry 108 this season.
* Although Clay Matthews only started 12 games due to injuries
* Going 5-1 in the division.  Green Bay made a rather strong statement with their 23-10 win over the Bears in week 2.  Including that ridiculously awesome fake field goal touchdown found [here](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap1000000062020/Special-teams-trickery)
* Randall Cobb had another great year giving Green Bay comfort for Greg Jennings impending departure via free agency.  He set the franchise record for all purpose yards in a single season.
* James ""I Don't Want the Ball"" Jones completely rid himself of that nickname.  He became notable this season for talking to himself loud enough for defenders to hear him and tieing a string around his finger to remind him to catch the ball.  He went without a drop for over half the season and showed that he can be that guy we want him to be.  
* Although Green Bay RB's have been a revolving door of mediocrity
* Mason Crosby had a very very lackluster season ending with a 63.6% success rate
* Jermichael Finley looked like he started to return ot his form that he had against [Arizona](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d815a5785/Wild-Card-Jermichael-Finley-highlights) a few years ago.  He ended the season on a really strong note
* The middle part of the offensive line seemed to solidify as soon as Jeff Saturday was replaced by Evan Dietrech-Smith.  But the tackles still need work.
* Ted Thompson once again proved his mastery at drafting players
* Finally, and although being slightly smaller than an NFL corner, was one of the better defenders in the league against the pass.  Nick Perry, although he suffered a season ending injury in week 6, showed he can be the linebacker opposite of Clay Matthews that Green Bay needs.


**Lows**

* The Packers continue to be unable to run the ball.  Although a late season reshuffling of the O-Line ended up with some good power runs behind Don Barclay
* The defensive line once again proved rather ineffective.  They continually get pushed around in the run game and rarely generate pressure on their own.  
* Lack of depth.  The Packers have no depth to speak of on OLB or DL.  ILB was ravaged by injuries to starters and backups so that group gets a pass.  As soon as Nick Perry went down there was absolutely no pass rush opposite Clay Mathews.  DL has no studs outside BJ Raji
* Week 11 loss to the New York Giants.  Even before the first quarter had ended
* Division round playoff loss to the 49ers.  Another game where the opponent had their way with the Packers defense.  Although the offense was able to keep things from getting downright ugly
* The one you've all been waiting for- week 3 ""loss"" to the Seahawks.  Although they did give up 8 sacks to the monstorous Seattle defensive line, and the league got lucky that playoffs were not severly affected.  This controversy was also how TJ Lang rose to Twitter fame tweeting after the game, ""Got fucked by the refs..Embarrasing. Thanks nfl."" and ""Fuck it NFL.. Fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs"".  That second tweet was retweeted over 92,000 times, setting a Twitter record.  

( I just want to make this clear, fans, etc. for what happened in the Fail Mary game, just the replacement officials.  I harbor no ill will to you all. You're just downright scary now.)

Generally what I mean by this is that more and more garbage posts are making it to the top.  Misleading titles, stadiums, Look Who I Met, etc) and general karmawhoring.

Some examples from the current front page:

* 1 - Marshall Newhouse mentions reddit on twitter.

* 2 - This is seriously a picture of Bellichick wearing an ugly sweatshirt.  Stop the presses.

* 7 - ""I was...when all of a sudden...""  This really irritates me.  No clue what the post is about until you click it and its a screencap of some bet about Jim and Jim hugging it out.  Riveting.

* 9 - this is actually a picture of a sign at an airport that mentions Cowboy Stadium.  Again no clue how mundane this is going to be until you click on it.

* 11 - This is a picture of a semi truck that is owned by the Steelers.

* 13 - I shit you not this is a picture of the 32 team logos all next to each other in a rectangle.  That's it.  Literally.  Nothing else. Fuck's sake.

Alright I can't go any further, the more bullshit like that is going to be voted up to the top, and the more thoughtful conversations and informative posts will fall through the cracks.

* First, we played it a little loose with what was ""acceptable.""  If you make a post similar to something we've allowed in recent weeks and months and it gets deleted, that's likely why.  With a substantial upswing of the availability of hard news, our interpretations of what is appropriate will become more strict.

**TL;DR:** We'll be removing more posts not directly related to football news and discussion. And seriously

* Please, if possible.  Seriously, present your counter argument.  Just trying to bury an alternative perspective or getting angry and belligerent fixes nothing.  It just pollutes the forum.  Calmly explain why you disagree.  You don't need to mute those having differing opinions.

**TL;DR:** Don't downvote something just because you disagree with someone's opinion.

* But there's another side to this coin.  If you present an opinion, don't be surprised if you do get downvoted.  Upvotes are for comments that contribute to the discussion, downvotes are for comments that take from it.  Even a valid argument, when wrapped in mockery, hostility, arrogance, or contempt

**TL;DR:** Don't be surprised or feel bullied if your opinion gets downvotes when you put it in a brash or superior voice.

* On the topic of hostility, but harassing or insulting individuals or team fan bases is unacceptable.  When you see it, report it.  Do it too much, and you won't be welcome here.

**TL;DR:** Don't go around insulting individuals or team fan bases. Chronic offenders will earn the boot.

|Fitzpatrick|'09-'12|52     |1742|59.8%|80  |4.6%|64  |3.7%|6.7|79.8   |

That's a damn near identical performance (and note that both QBs have been with the same team for all four years)

Well

|:--------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:------------:|

From their identical Y/A they appear to have similar running ability

|Player|Year  |Sacks + Groundings|Dropbacks|ASR|
|:----:|:----:|:-----------------:|:--------:|:--:|
|Cutler|'09-'12|184                     |2175       |8.5%|
|Fitzpatrick|'09-'12|133               |2138       |6.2%|

Adjusted Sack Rate -- ASR -- is a [Football Outsiders](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol2009) stat that measures how often a QB is sacked or forced into an intentional grounding penalty when he drops back.  From '09-'12 ASR typically ranges from around 3.5% to around 9.5%, though, that QBs can avoid sacks by throwing the ball away, scrambling, adjusting protection, changing the play, etc. -- and that sometimes [taking a sack is by far the best option.](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18amb69xjthfggif/ku-xlarge.gif)

We know the quality of one's team affects a QB's play

|Team|Year|Rush YPG|Rush Y/A|Rush Rank|Def YPG|Def Y/P|D Rank (Yds)|#1 WR Yds|
|:--:|:-----:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:----------:|:----------:|
|Bears|'09-'12|110.8      |4.1     |17.5|329.5|5.1       |12.0          |988     |

The Bills have rushed for 10 more yards/game, for four years.  ""#1 WR Yds"" is the average production of each team's leading receiver for each year; a quick-and-dirty way of measuring the competency of each squad's WRs.  Neither team had much in the way of WRs in '09, Buffalo probably had a slightly superior group in '10 and '11, and the addition of Brandon Marshall clearly elevated Chicago's group in '12.  I'd say that's roughly a push, and the numbers back that up.

A few other notes:

* *Strength of schedule:*  I don't know of anywhere to find the record of each team's opponents
* *Injuries:*  Injuries to one's teammates can harm a QB's performance
* *Why just the last four years?*  Both QBs started roughly the same number of games on the same team over the last four years

**TL:DR:**  So [what does it all mean, but Fitz is a more productive scrambler (and less likely to fumble).  Fitz plays with a better O-line, but Cutler plays with a better defense.  Neither has had great WRs to work with, and both have struggled with interceptions.  **All things considered, we give Cutler too much credit and Fitzpatrick too little.**

**EDIT:**  Thanks for the responses -- this is a great discussion.  A few comments on some recurring themes:

* **How much does an O-line help/hurt a QB?**  Not as much as you probably think.  Take a look at this (dated) [FO article on sack rates for different QBs on the same team.](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2003/fun-sacks-part-ii)  Even though QBs play behind the same O-line in the same season
* **How much does defense help/hurt a QB?**  One major way defense influences offense is starting field position.  [The average LOS at the start of a drive](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/drivestats2009) varied significantly between the Bears and the Bills from '09-'12.  With an average starting LOS on the 30.78, and averaged a rank of 7.5.  The Bills -- at 28.14 -- only sniffed the top-10 one year and averaged a rank of 19.75.  [This amount of difference in starting LOS does matter.](http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/importance-of-field-position.html)  The QB has to do less to win and can therefore be more conservative in close situations.
* **Coaching:**  Cutler has had three OCs (Turner, Modkins) and three HCs (Jauron, Fewell, Gailey) in Buffalo.  Cutler's OCs tended to be more experienced and came with more past success -- Martz's offenses in St. Louis and Detroit finished in the top-10 in passing yards for nine years straight (including seven straight top-5 years), Tice coached four top-10 passing offenses in Minnesota (including two top-5 years), and Ron Turner at least had a decade of coordinator experience in Chicago.  Van Pelt and Modkins, meanwhile, but he objectively had more pedigreed and more experienced coaches and coordinators.
* **Cutler ""looks"" better:**  I have a tough time putting much stock in the eye test when you have four years of player performance to compare.  I could care less if Jacoby Ellsbury *looks* like he steals the most bases, and are particularly useful when you have a sample size of nearly half a decade.  I'm not too hung up on who has the stronger arm or seems to move better in the pocket -- we've already seen the extent to which those qualities will help each player.  These QBs are halfway into their pro careers; I think it's more important to discuss what we know they can do in a realistic environment than to speculate as to what they could do in an ideal situation.",,False,,t5_2qmg3,1372196393.0,packers,

The Redskins gave their 1st round pick in 2013 to The Rams in the blockbuster trade that landed them RGIII. 

The Redskins traded Albert Haynesworth to The Patriots for a 5th round pick. 

The Redskins originally traded QB Donovan McNabb for a 2012 6th round pick which turned out to be RB Alfred Morris and a conditional 6th round pick in 2013 but McNabb didn't meet the minimum playing time requirements in Minnesota so The Vikings will not send their 2013 6th round pick back to The Redskins. 
 
The Redskins traded Kevin Barnes to The Lions for a conditional pick but those conditions were not met so The Lions will not be returning that pick back to The Redskins either. In addition

**2012 Season Overview**

* The Redskins off-season story:

The Redskins ended 2011 with a 5-11 record and desperately needing a replacement for their two subpar quarterbacks. John Beck could only complete passes to the RB

With the 6th overall pick in 2012, trading their 2012 1st and 2nd round picks, as well as 2013 and 2014's 1st round picks. Mike Shanahan was entering his third season as head coach with only an 11-21 record, so he effectively bet his career on one player.

In the preseason, the majority of which came from under center. There were rumors that Kyle Shanahan was trying to work in some plays from the Baylor playbook to help RG3's transition, but the infamous RG3-Alfred Morris pistol formation was still completely unseen.
The RB battle was fairly split, so the position was completely in the air.
Two of the biggest offseason signings were WR Pierre Garcon and WR Josh Morgan. They were competing with Redskins fan favorite Santana Moss, speedy Aldrick Robinson.

The Redskins' largest concerns entering Week 1 were the offensive line and the secondary. Other than LT Trent Williams

Just prior to the start of free agency The Redskins were slammed with a 36$ million cap penalty by the NFL for overspending on contracts in the 2010 un-capped year. They were forced to take the hit in cap space which was to be split over the 2012 and 2013 seasons cutting 18$ million each year. This limited The Redskins options in free-agency as they were simply unable to afford the talent they needed in key positions. To general manager Bruce Allen's credit however

* The Redskins storybook 2012 season:

Despite the enormous cap penalty and lack of depth in the secondary The Redskins ended their 2012 regular season 10-6 handing The Dallas Cowboys a loss in-front of an ecstatic home crowd in what was essentially the NFC EAST Championship Game. They had also solved their quarterback woes with QB Robert Griffin III leading the team to their first division title since 1999 throwing for 20 TD’s to 5 INT’s with a 65.6 completion % and 3

RGIII was the story of the year but fellow rookies Alfred Morris,613 yards and 13 TD's while 4th round pick Kirk Cousins provided 1st round talent leading The Redskins to over-time and an improbable comeback victory against The Baltimore Ravens when an injured RGIII left the field. Kirk Cousins would go on to start the week after on the road in Cleveland throwing for 329 yards and 2 TD's to 1 INT leading The Redskins to a 38-21 win.

The Redskins went 5-1 in their division riding a seven game winning streak into the playoffs after falling 3-6 before the bye-week. They did this by relying on an incredibly efficient and explosive passing game coupled with the leagues best rushing attack exploiting the read-option pistol formation much to the dismay of opposing defenses.  

**Low Points** 

* Injuries: SS Brandon Meriweather sat out the first 3 weeks of the season recovering from a torn MCL only to re-injure himself in a pregame collision during warm-ups in week 4. Meriweather would return in week 10 against Philadelphia registering an INT and several hard hits, he limped off the field and subsequently missed nearly half the season with a plantar plate tear in his right foot. Contemplating season ending surgery Garçon opted out and was able to return week 10 and play full-time. Finally, TE Fred Davis, the teams leading receiver suffered a torn Achilles tendon in week 7 missing the rest of the regular season. 

* Pass Defense: The Redskins secondary was a liability throughout the season consistently blowing coverage's and giving up huge plays over the top ensuring just about every opposing QB had a career day. Almost every bit of good The Redskins offense did was constantly undermined by a defense giving up an equal or greater play going the other way. To their credit the secondary did tighten up considerably over the second half of the season and a stout rush defense helped them get by. 

* Lack of composure: Week 2's match-up at the Rams' Edward Jones Dome could be summed up in one word: shitshow. The replacement refs really showcased how bad they were capable of letting things get in this game. Terrible blown calls mostly benefited the Redskins in the first half giving a 21-6 lead, were injured in the second quarter, Sam Bradford had a great game, going 26/35 for 310 yd, 3 TD and 1 INT. Danny Amendola had a career game, catching 15 passes for 160 yd and 1 TD. With the Redskins down 28-31 and approaching FG range for a game-tying kick, CB Cortland Finnegan was able to draw a personal foul call on WR Josh Morgan

* Week 7 Loss at the Giants: A DAGGER THROUGH MY HEART! RGIII made some incredible plays to keep the game alive, Victor Cruz blew past FS Madieu Williams on the second play of the Giants' drive for a 77 yard TD. When the Redskins started rallying back, Santana Moss fumbled the game away to seal the 23-27 loss. Absolute heart-breaker. 

* Week 9 Home Loss to the Panthers: During an embarrassing ""homecoming"" game The Redskins played terribly. Cam Newton didn't. The Redskins lost 21-13 to fall to 3-6 overall marking a three game losing streak heading into the bye and Mike Shanahan commented that he's starting to evaluate the players for 2013

* Wildcard Weekend: Oh boy. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. Coming off of a seven game winning streak The Redskins hosted The Seattle Seahawks in a game that will live on in infamy. The season ended in heartbreak as The Redskins fell 24-14 after scoring two consecutive TD's on their opening two drives on route to what looked like a blowout. To add injury to insult an already hobbled Robert Griffin III suffered both MCL and LCL tears as his knee buckled trying to recover a fumbled snap late in the game. The Redskins coaching staff was treated with an absolute onslaught of criticism for their handling of RGIII. Redskins management meanwhile drew an onslaught of criticism for the field quality at FedEx stadium which was clearly a contributing factor to injuries sustained by players on both teams.  

**High Points** 

* RGIII Debut: Redskins fans hoped for the best but were prepared for the worst opening the season on the road in the Super-dome with a rookie QB at the helm. Then, with his seventh pass taken 88 yards for a TD to Pierre Garcon. RGIII ended the game going 19/26 for 320 yards and 2 TD's in a 40-32 win. Redskins fans had not seen offensive scoring and fireworks like that in over a decade. The defense was sound, limiting Drew Brees to 24/52 passing and registering 3 takeaways. 

* Kai Forbath: The offseason had a fierce kicking battle between Graham Gano and Neil Rackers. Both were kicking very well, then went 1/4 against the Bucs, but made the 41-yard game winner. After missing another one against the Falcons, Kai Forbath was brought in for a tryout and beat out Cundiff. Forbath's first FG attempt was a booming 50-yard FG against the Vikings. He would go on to set the record for most consecutive made FG's to begin a career with 17. Eleven were from 40+, and against the Ravens he made FG's from 48, 49, and the game-winner from 34 yards in OT.

* Dallas Thanksgiving Game: The Redskins were 4-6 and the Cowboys were 5-5, 4 TD, and 1 INT. Alfred Morris finished with 113 yd on 24 carries.

* The ever-popular Battle of the Beltway: The Redskins were on a three-game win streak to sit at 6-6 with a renewed hope for the playoffs. The Ravens were 9-3 and looking to rebound after a close loss at home against the Steelers. The Redskins took an early 14-7 lead but Ravens came back and took an 8-point lead with 4:52 left in the 4th quarter. RGIII was injured by Haloti Ngata on a 2nd down scramble bringing in Captain Kirk Cousins for his NFL debut on a 3rd and 6. A PI call gave the Redskins a new set of downs and allowed RGIII to come back in. The Redskins drove down to the 16 yard line, then a 3rd down TD strike to Pierre Garcon. The Redskins ran a 5-wide QB draw to get the 2-point conversion and force OT. The Ravens received and went three-and-out, and newly minted rookie punt returner CB Richard Crawford took the punt return back 64 yds down to the Ravens' 24. A Kai Forbath kick gave the Redskins an unbelievable win.

* Dallas Week 17 Game: Perhaps the biggest Redskins game since Superbowl XXVI in 1991. The winner gets the NFC East crown and heads to the playoffs. The loser gets to begin their off-season. With RGIII's knee in a brace, throwing two INT's in the first quarter. Still, a couple of great throws kept the Cowboys in the game until an INT to OLB Rob Jackson in the 4th quarter sealed the game. The Redskins won 28-18, completing their 7-game win streak, winning the NFC East title for the first time since 1999, and ending the greatest run to the playoffs in Redskins history.

**General**



* Coming off of an uninspired 10 game losing streak to close out the 2011 season, the Bucs have almost completely rid themselves of the Tampa-2 base in favor of playing man coverage and creating (or attempting to create) pressure with blitz packages.  Much of Schiano's focus was to bring a never-say-die toughness to the team which he exemplified on the controversial victory formation play week 2 against the Giants. 



* Tampa Bay's front offense made several significant changes to the roster in the off season.  Unlike any year in recent memory, GM Mark Dominik masterfully worked trades to draft starters S Mark Barron, RB Doug Martin and LB Lavonte David.  All three rookies were highly productive throughout the season, providing building blocks for a bright future.  Subtractions were deemed necessary as well.  Several players including Kellen Winslow Jr, Brian Price and Dezmon Briscoe were purged for not meeting Greg Schiano's standard of a Buccaneer man.  



* The Buccaneer’s season was a roller coaster of emotions for fans.  Tampa Bay got off to a sluggish start losing 3 of their first 4 games, winning 5 out of 6 games, finding themselves at 6-4 and in good position for a playoff run.  During this span, the Buccaneers offense was absolutely clicking, averaging over 35 points per game.  After capping off their winning streak with an exciting overtime win against the Panthers, the Bucs went cold, losing 5 straight games including an embarrassing 41-0 trouncing by the New Orleans Saints.  Mercifully, who had already clenched NFC’s #1 seed.  



* The Buccaneers have given the Tampa Bay area something new to cheer for: an offense.  The Bucs may not have been the best in the league,820 yards of total offense, 389 total points scored and 44 TDs.  Josh Freeman set the individual team record for most TD passes thrown in single season (27) and became the first Buccaneer to throw for over 4,000 yards.  Doug Martin chipped in by setting the franchise rookie rushing record of 1,454 yards.  Despite all of this, the offense struggled in some games and QB Josh Freeman drew a lot of criticism for his inconsistent play.  



* Overall, however bad the Bucs were on defense in some areas, they were stellar in other areas, making them somewhat of an anomaly.  They finished dead last in pass defense, getting torched for an average of 297.4 ypg.  On the other hand, the Bucs had the leagues’ best run defense, allowing a mere 82.5 ypg setting the franchise record.  Part of their inability to stop the pass was a lack of QB pressure.  Tied for 29th place with Kansas City, the Bucs dominated the league in tackles for a loss despite the low sack number.  The defensive as a whole was clearly the weakest link



**Highs**



* Ronde Barber celebrated his 200th consecutive start (all with Tampa Bay) in the season opener against Carolina.  The veteran defensive back notched an interception



* Week 1 against Carolina was also the debut of the Bucs stout run defense.  In the game, the 11th best mark in the history of the league. 



* Coming off their week 5 bye, Freeman put up gaudy stats, throwing for 1715 yards (285.8 ypg), 16 TDs and only 3 INTs (2 thrown in one game against Carolina).  Freeman became the first Buccaneer to throw 3 TDs in 3 consecutive games.  



* WR Vincent Jackson proved to be worthy of the generous contract he landed in the off season.  Jackson’s best game came in a loss against the New Orleans Saints in week 7.  VJax hauled in 7 catches for 216 yards and a TD,384 yards and 8 TDs.  His 19.2 yards per catch average was tops in the league.  He also [made this catch](http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/vjax-td2-11-18-12.gif) to the dismay of Panthers fans in week 11.



* Tampa receivers tied the league record with zero turnovers on the season.



* Tampa Bay’s only prime time game, recorded 3 catches for 79 yards and notched 2 total TDs.  Most of his receiving yards came [on this play](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1628781/martinscreen.gif) where Martin showed his speed and versatility.  



* Doug Martin followed up his breakout performance against the Vikings with one of the [best rushing performances](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1686921/hamsterHOF.gif) of all time against the Oakland Raiders in week 9.  On just 25 carries, 67 and 70 yards, he became the first back since at least 1940 to score on three TD runs of at least 45 yards in a single game.  He also joins Denver’s Mike Anderson as the only running backs to amass at least 250 yards and find the end zone 4 times in one game.  Being from Oakland, the 31st overall draft pick did all of this in front of more than 60 friends and family members. 



* Doug Martin's 2012 stat line is impressive: 319 carries for 1, and 12 total TDs.  Martin's 1,454 rushing yards gives him the franchise rookie rushing record and places him second behind James Wilder's (1544 yards) franchise record.  Equally impressive, out of his 368 total touches, Martin only fumbled once on a play that could have easily been called a TD.



* Rookie Lavonte David's 139 total tackles rank second among rookies and 9th overall.  Out of his 139 tackles



* Tampa Bay finished the season with 95 tackles for a loss



**Lows**



* Despite being one of the few teams to take advantage of the league’s new 85% rule, but has really struggled to fill the stadium since the glory days.



* Week 2 at the NY Giants began with much promise



* The Bucs followed up their defensive meltdown to the Giants with an inept offense against the Cowboys in week 3.  Josh Freeman completed 10 of 28 attempts (35.7%) for 110 yards



* Tampa Bay was still in the thick of playoff talks when week 14 rolled around.  They were playing the dysfunctional Eagles who were riding an 8 game losing streak.  Though looking like the better team



* The Bucs would love to forget their week 15 game at the division rival New Orleans Saints.  The Saints absolutely trounced the Bucs 41-0.  This was the Saints first shutout victory since 1995.  What’s worse?  The Saints pitched their shutout despite their historically bad defense.  The opposing QBs had polar opposite days: Josh Freeman threw 0 TDs and 4 INTs while Drew Brees threw 4 TDs and 0 INTs.  This was painful to watch.



* Corners Aqib Talib and Eric Wright each earned a 4 game suspension for Adderall use.  With one game left on his suspension



* Throughout the season, but the Bucs proved to lack any semblance of depth.  



* 7 out of Tampa’s 9 losses were within one score.  Some may consider this to be a high point of the season since they hung with most opponents and show promise for the future



**Free Agency / Draft Concerns**



Adding depth at every position is essential.  Needs for the starting roster include CB, DL, WR3.



* Vincent Jackson and Carl Nicks both restructured their contracts



* GM Mark Dominik deftly added a clause to Eric Wright’s contract eliminating any liability should the CB get suspended.  Wright missed 4 games with an Adderall suspension, I fully expect the Bucs to cut Wright and focus on landing a quality starter or two in free agency.  Possible fits include Sam Shields, Brent Grimes and Chris Houston.  



* Ronde Barber may have another season in him.  The Bucs already expressed an interest in re-signing him, but the need will likely be filled in free agency or the draft.  Possible FAs include Jairus Byrd (I did say *possible*) and Kenny Phillips.



* Dallas Clark played well given his age and injury history



* The Bucs will also look to replace Sam Backer Quincy Black



*The Draft*



Last year, but he’ll likely be off the board.  If the Bucs don’t move up to get him, they’ll have a number of options without much separation in talent.  In this scenario, Tampa will likely trade down to select Xavier Rhodes, Jonathon Banks, Desmond Trufant or Jordan Poyer. If the Bucs do stay at pick 13, they may elect to draft a TE like Zach Ertz or Tyler Eifert.  Then again, all this can change dramatically. ",t5_2qmg3,True
