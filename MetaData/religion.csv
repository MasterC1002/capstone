It really bugs me that people just hop onto the bandwagon without giving it a second thought.  If you actually look at the concept of heaven and hell, therefore being a separation from love.  Looking at the simple theology behind it gives you that much more insight to it.  I think most everyone can agree that if you separate yourself from love, you are going to have a bad time.

Just a pet peeve of mine, ""~~Buddhism~~The Iroquois says the world is on a turtles back, we have pics to prove it isn't. Checkmate ~~buddhists~~Natives American Religion!""  Obviously in this example the Iroquois religion is using imagery to demonstrate a point about our relationship with the earth.

&gt;Dear Church Family
 
&gt;Several months ago
&gt;publicly in a derogatory fashion about the Islam faith and its adherents.  As
&gt;the Pastor of Dallas' oldest deeded and dedicated Christian church
&gt;the opportunity to call the Imam at Dallas' oldest mosque to apologize and
&gt;express that not all Christians hold the opinion of that pastor and promised
&gt;to work with him toward understanding and peace.
&gt; 
&gt;Last night Suzanne and I were invited by Imam Khalid Shaheed and his wife
&gt;Bettie to attend an interfaith Ramadan Iftar banquet at the mosque in Richardson.
&gt;It was a wonderful experience!  What struck me the most was that we were
&gt;Jewish, Sikh, Hindu Americans all sitting down at the
&gt;tables together
&gt;as though we were one nation under God.
&gt; 
&gt;The United Methodist Church was very well represented by clergy and lay
&gt;persons from various churches around the metroplex.  It was a real honor
&gt;to sit at a table with the Imam and his wife
&gt;Community Relations and a representative of the Roman Catholic diocese.
&gt;Suzanne and I were very proud to represent Cochran Chapel and we look
&gt;forward to continued good relations with the Imam and his wife.
&gt; 
&gt;Jesus has certainly set the example for us as Christians willing to sit at
&gt;table and break bread together in unity and peace.  Last night for two hours
&gt;persons of many different faith expressions did just that
&gt;in unity and peace and respect.  And
&gt; 
&gt;Peace and grace to you

Why do you choose instead to lead each other into ignorant and frankly dangerous ways of thinking and living? 
I thought the point of a church was to help people live better lives. 
What does that have to do with denying the observations of people throughout the world you claim was created by ""god""? 
I feel that by denying your own eyes and brain you are either saying that god is lying, instead of building the world and governing the world in ways that are visible to man, and in ways we can observe and understand, decided to make a huge illusion around us all to trick us and see who really believes.

Salutations

I write this letter to you with good will and in the hope next year we improve our relations. Like it or not

**I respect your passion.** We're going to butt heads and I'm ok with you getting angry with me. Heck

**I will give you the benefit of the doubt.** If you can give me convincing arguments about your position, the judge of what convinces me, what changes my point of view, and I'll explain my reasons.

**I will try my best to be civil.** We've been on the internet long enough to know that anonymity creates brave cowards. I'm not going to deny I'm going to get pissed from time to time. If I cross the line

**I will do my best to use facts.** In our passion to prove each other wrong

And finally

**I respect your right to practice your religion.** The separation of church and state means a lot to me, I can agree you have a right to it and I can support your right to it.

Thanks for reading, peace and joy throughout the year!

""Today I went to First Baptist Church of _________ to volunteer. They were having a feed the homeless event and I signed up to help as a student from Iota Kappa Chi which is the nursing club at ________ College. After serving food to several people, came up to me and told me she had to ask me to leave and that I am not allowed to help out. I asked 'why not?' And she says because they are a Christian church and therefore cant allow ""someone like me"" to be there and help out. I told her it was not as if I was imposing my beliefs on anyone, I just wanted to help feed the homeless but she wouldn't have it. I was completely speechless and did not know what to since I haven't dealt with such Islamophobia especially being completely alone and not knowing anyone at the church. So with tears in my eyes, I went outside and headed towards my car. 

I was going to leave but then I realized I did not have to accept being treated with such intolerance from anyone. Who was that lady to tell me to leave just because I'm a Muslim. So I wipe away my tears and walked back into the church. I asked another lady who was in charge and she pointed to 'Linda', that we both believe in God and Jesus. She then said the most ignorant thing ever. She said ""No, the Jesus and God you believe in are different than the ones we believe in."" I told her If someone wanted to help Jesus with something, I'm sure he wouldn't reject them just because they not christian. She agreed but still wouldn't let me help. I realized how ignorant she was of her own religion so I couldn't blame her for being ignorant of Islam. So I told her I wanted speak to whoever was in charge of the church. She told me the pastor was in charge but he wasn't there today so I asked for his contact information. She went and got me the church's business card and I left.

It is 2013 and I live in Southern California which is one of the most diverse places in the US so I never thought I would the be recipient of such tolerance, they will be having a service. I am going to go there and see if I can talk to the pastor. If the pastor can make things right then Alhamdulillah, but if not then further action will be taken. I'm writing this experience just to make everyone aware of how intolerant people are even though we are in 2013. Experiences like these just make me proud to be a Muslim and make me stronger because it motivates me to stand up for what's right. I make dua that Allah makes something positive come out of this.""",,False,self,t5_2qh39,,http://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1hsjob/a_dear_friend_of_mine_volunteered_at_a_church_to/

By: David Mc

David Mc:  Could you tell me your full name please?

Fred Phelps Jr.:  Fred Phelps Jr...which

D.M.:  I'm sorry?

F.P.:  You know the swimmer Michael Phelps?

D.M.:  Yes

F.P.:  If you Google his name

D.M.:  [chuckle] Oh is that right?

F.P.:  Isn't that interesting?

D.M.:  [chuckle] OK

F.P.:  Oh...truth.

D.M.:  Proof?

F.P.:  No.  Truth.  

D.M.:  Oh

F.P.:  Well, mushy, meaningless crap or all those fag parades...their definition of love is lust.  Physical lust.  

D.M.:  Uh-huh

F.P.:  The Bible's definition clearly says so is...telling your neighbor the truth.  Warning them that their sin is taking them to hell.  And that's proof.  And that's love.

D.M.:  Ok

F.P.:  ...Yes

D.M.:  Could you elaborate please

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  --but do you believe there is a different punishment for these different levels?

F.P.:  Absolutely

D.M.:  Yes

F.P.:  Sodom and Gomorrah was physically destroyed. If you believe what the Bible says, commanding that they have homosexual sex with the 
angels that were in his house and that's grievous... that’s a sin the Bible calls abomination.

D.M.:  OK.  If you could define salvation

F.P.:  Rescuing..uh..a sinner from his eternal damnation...

D.M.:  ...OK.  How important was Jesus's ministry on earth in your opinion?

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  Yes

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  And feed my children

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  And that's not talking about physically feeding...I mean it could include that

D.M.:  OK.  If..I'm not sure if you’re familiar with the verse

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  OK

F.P.:  But

D.M.:  --Well

F.P.:  --Sure.

D.M.:  It is “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”

F.P.:  ...Yeah

D.M.:  Well

F.P.:  OK, you're not going to be saved. I don't remember the exact lines...whoever believes on him will be saved.  “The world” is used in many different ways throughout the Bible.  It refers to the earthly geographical, sometimes it refers to the gentiles as opposed to the Jewish world, it..at no time does it include every single human being really...if...they included that at time in the front cause even then it didn’t include every human being.  It's misused.  It's clearly not every human being that...God did not come to love every human being or every human being would be in heaven. His love is impotent...his salvation is impotent if he has to rely on some week sinful humans to accept it.

D.M.:  OK.  Yes, I came across the Five points of Calvinism and that seems a lot like one of the five points.

F.P.:  Uhh...whats one of the five points?

D.M.:  Well

F.P.:  --Yeah

D.M.:  I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.:  Did Osama Bin Laden go to heaven?

D.M.:  I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.:  Did Christ die for him? Did he send his son that Osama Bin Laden might be saved?

D.M.:  I don’t know

F.P.:  Did Adolph Hitler or the tyrants and murders...Stalin?  We have dealt with this in great detail on our website. There is a special paper called the “John 3:16 Lie”.  We’ve gone into great academic detail cause that verse is so fragrantly and sadistically misused.  If the students in our colleges, they would flunk 
out of school so I would refer you to that paper that’s there on the website

D.M.:  OK.  Is there any place for repentance for homosexuals?

F.P.:  You know...uh...we've certainly been asked that many times over the years. there’s two passages in the bible that pretty well convince me the answer is “no”, where three different times describing homosexuals...god has given them up. You can't come to repent that so God has 
given you up and then the other passage would be, and dogs is the Bible's metaphor for homosexuals.

D.M.:  We're very close to being finished here.  So this is kind of branching off of that question. Is it the church's opinion that it is entirely a choice to be homosexual?  [crosstalk]  Now I'm not asking about performing homosexual acts...I'm asking about
your church believe it is a choice to be a homosexual?

D.M.:  Well, Roman Chapter 1 describes this in great detail. They rejected, refused to acknowledge him as God.

D.M.:  Uh-huh.

F.P.:  You know

D.M.:  [chuckle] Oh

F.P.:  --How old are you?

D.M.:  I am 26

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  I'm going to school at..uh..its a community college in New Bern

F.P.:  OK

D.M.:  Well, adulterers, and murderers.  I'm not sure if you would interpret this as true, but could you comment on that?

F.P.:  ...Whats that again? Tax cheaters?

D.M.:  Well, murderers...

F.P.:  ...Well, there. First thing is we do indeed preach to...uh...we have signs that say “Divorce = Adultery” and we have signs about abortion, which certainly is the main fashion of killing in this nation anymore. Tens of thousands of babies killed every year so we do indeed press those issues but that leads me to my second point I would make on this 
is...we don’t control the media.  The media has been pushing this fag filth for several decades.  They are the ones who have pushed this onto the front pages of the nation's newspapers and the lead stories on the 6 o’clock news and the national news...this homosexual relentless **** beatings that’s bound resulting in same sex marriage across the nation so that’s the part of our ministry that seems to get most of the media attention as that’s part of their agenda. So that would be my second major point. 

D.M.:  OK, immediate and distant...uh...children and adults alike, this is correct, right?

F.P.:  Well, marriage or otherwise.

D.M.:  Alright,who are under the age of 18,...essentially...came out and announced they were homosexual.  What would be the church's opinion on...the decidings[sic] of the individual?

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  Well, I'm trying to find--[crosstalk]

F.P.:  If they were not a member

D.M.:  What I'm really trying to find out with this question is...you know..obviously this child would not be able to legally leave...or become emancipated.  I'm trying to find if the church would..i mean..place the child up for adoption? Or if the church would--

F.P.:  --[chuckle] No

D.M.:  Well, but I'm trying to find out if someone in the church wasn’t “up” with someone else in the church, in this case a child, would this child have to leave?

F.P.:  No

D.M.:  Well, I'd like to say if you're not too busy, if you have anything you'd like to add...I mean, the floor is entirely open to you. As I said, I will be transcribing this and I will be presenting this to the classroom so...eyes will be seeing this so if there's anything you'd like to add please feel free to say anything you like.

F.P.:  Well

D.M.:  Well

F.P.:  Right, that’s “one-nine-five-five”, and...you know I've appreciated the opportunity to respond to your questions and I hope it helps you and anyone else who hears it

D.M.:  Yes sir

F.P.:  OK

D.M.:  Thank you very much

F.P.:  OK

D.M.:  Bye.

Two years later, I lacked a lot of basic adult skills. After one Scientology class, I was amazed at how well presented such novel, and yet useful, concepts of life were being displayed... ready to be picked up and used.

I quickly went aboard as a staff member and was fully immersed for about 1 1/2 years. Eventually

Within a few years

Over the next decade or so

Eventually

My life has been 'interesting' since... not in the way you might suspect. I have had to come to terms with my own lack of spiritual identity

Anyways

**Edit:**  Thanks for the Reddit Gold

**Edit #2:**  One thing has solidified with me on this review of my past experience.  The biggest fault I have with Scientology is that it takes itself too seriously.  One man had to do it all.  One church has to maintain a monopoly on the entire body of research and forces you to accept all or none or be accused of perverting it.  Eventually,,False,self,t5_2qh39,1347065785.0,,True

(Written for the People's National Party—P. N. P.-of Jamaica
By Bertell Ollman

Is this true? Listen to the words of Jesus and decide for yourselves whether Socialism is Practical Christianity.

SOCIALISM MEANS BROTHERHOOD:

    ""all ye are brethren."" (Matthew""23;8)

    ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.""(Matthew: 22; 39)

    ""All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you

    ""Let everyone who possesses two shirts share with him who has none

    ""Give to every man that asketh of thee."" (Luke: 6; 30) 


SOCIALISM MEANS JUSTICE:

    ""Give and it shall be given unto you...for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."" (Luke: 6; 38) 

SOCIALISM MEANS BEING FOR POOR PEOPLE AND AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS:

    ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me

SOCIALISM MEANS OPPOSITION TO THE GREEDY RICH:

    ""Woe unto you that are rich

    ""No man can serve two masters…Ye cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew: 6; 24)

    ""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle

SOCIALISM MEANS CHRISTIAN CONCERN FOR SOCIAL PROBLEMS:

Jesus' life, he and his disciples shared what they had with all about them. For centuries afterwards, those who called themselves Christians were most noteworthy for the cooperative fellowship that characterized the community in which Jesus lived. For these men, Christianity was a matter of making over their lives to bring the greatest good to mankind. So, too, for many of the early Christian missionaries who came to Jamaica. It was Churchmen like Knibb, Burchell and Sharpe who fought the planters and got slavery abolished. Land settlement to provide land for the freed slaves and public education for the children of the poor also came about through the efforts of these true Christians. George Williams Gordon and Bogle of St. Thomas were Churchmen who were willing to suffer martyrdom to improve the conditions of the people.
SOCIALISM MEANS THE SOLUTION:

Then, and putting this love into practice. In the modern period, unemployment and its accompanying ills have replaced slavery as the principal evil. Today in Jamaica no true Christian can remain indifferent while hundreds of thousands of his countrymen are ill-fed, badly housed, illiterate, and without proper medical care. Pained by the sight of so much suffering, many high minded Christians have turned to socialism as the solution.
SOCIALISM MEANS AN END TO CAPITALIST INJUSTICE:

Capitalism, ""One soweth, and another reapeth""(John: 4; 37). Well might we say to the wealthy few who own our large estates and factories what Jesus said to his disciples: ""you…reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor""(John: 4; 38). The capitalists cease from resting only to eat, while you cease from working only to rest, and eat only when you can. Do you believe that Jesus favored such injustice, he who said, ""by their fruits ye shall know them""(Mathew: 7; 20)? The fruits of capitalism in Jamaica can be seen even by the blind; they are poverty, illiteracy
SOCIALISM MEANS LIVING THE GOLDEN RULE:

Socialism is the exact opposite of capitalism. In socialism, because a plan has been created to put everyone to work. Illiteracy is soon abolished, and the diseases that plague people are reduced to the few for which advanced medicine has not found a cure. Each individual is given the chance of developing himself to the fullest, with everyone helping him in whatever way they can. The Golden Rule—""as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise""(Luke: 6; 31)—has become the rule which all men follow in their daily lives.
SOCIALISM MEANS THE PEOPLE OWN THEIR COUNTRY:

The journey to socialism is long and hard; but Jesus never said Christianity was easy. The road to socialism passes by way of public ownership of large estates and factories, the local community, or the national Government. In this way people will own their places of work, either directly or through some body duly elected to represent them. If a man works on his own as a farmer or craftsman, he will continue to do so or become a member of a local cooperative. The choice is his, and, no matter what he chooses, security during ill health and old age, and cultural facilities, cooperation
SOCIALISM DOES NOT MEAN WHAT ITS ENEMIES SAYS IT DOES:

There are a few rich people in Jamaica who hate socialism, try to scare people by telling them lies about socialism. These are the ""false prophets"" of our day. Jesus, too, had put up with many lies told by those who disliked his teachings. Here are some of the worst lies you are likely to hear about socialism. Don't you be fooled.

It is a LIE that socialism is against Christianity. How can it be when socialism is Christianity put into practice? It is a LIE that people cannot worship freely in socialism. It is a LIE that socialism means cutting your goat or house in two and giving half to the government. It is a LIE that socialism means that the small farmer will have his land taken away from him. It is a LIE that socialism will make us all prisoners of the Russians or the Chinese or the Cubans. What nonsense
SOCIALISM IS COMING—WITH YOUR HELP:

If, it is the duty of every Christian to help bring it about as quickly as possible. Keep in mind—all that is needed to win a victory for EQUALITY and BROTHERHOOD is for enough of you, the people of Jamaica, to want it and to will it. In politics, as in religious matters, we have much to learn from Jesus' words:

    ""Ask, and it shall be opened to you""(Mathew: 7; 7).

...Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. And he sent messengers on ahead, they asked, ""Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"" But Jesus turned and rebuked them, and they went to another village.  

Though he might have just been trying to cover the fact that he can't really reign fire down on cities

""You have heard that it was said, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.  

Sounds an awful lot like Pat and Rush need to be going to Haiti right now and giving the villagers their *own* clothes. In fact

&gt;**Matthew 9:10 - 13**  
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, ""Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"" On hearing this, Jesus said, ""It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.""  

Once again, healing them.  

I'm not trying to convert anyone, etc. I'm just pointing out their own hypocrisy.

---

1\. **The books are geared toward shutting down reasonable discussion

*examples:* See below.

2\. **They espouse a shallow and misleading view of history.** The view of history they present as a long clash between religion and secularism breaks down when you look at the details. The flaws in their arguments can usually be shown by looking at the very sources they cite. They ignore evidence that doesn't contribute to their arguments

*examples:* Harris' account of the Gujurat riots ignores evidence of political

3\. **The gods they reject are gods that they themselves have created.** They start off on the wrong foot by assuming that gods are, their arguments are calculated to knock down straw men.

*examples:* Dawkins' argument that God is improbable only works against a version of god that differs sharply from the Abrahamic tradition; Harris' descriptions of gods are mostly inconsistent; Hitchens' complains that a real god would have created a better world than this

4\. **Their criticisms of faith are based on faulty accounts of belief.** They imply that religious belief is psychologically abnormal. They paint it as necessarily and inevitably dangerous. Meanwhile

*examples:* Dawkins insists on ""the religious mind"" as an ad hominem; Harris insists that beliefs are held as logical propositions; Dennett's study of ""non-believing"" clergy misrepresents its subject by constraining them to a narrow definition of gods.

5\. **The ways they define and identify religion don't match up with religion as we observe it in the real world.** They're committed to the idea that religion boils down to creed. By their criteria

*examples:* Harris insists that Buddhism is not a religion; both Harris and Hitchens identify certain political movements as religions; Dennett insists that religions must focus on supernatural agents

6\. **They consistently mangle moral philosophy.** In arguing that religion is inherently immoral, where normal people are excepted to cede moral responsibility to specialists.

*examples:* The evolution of altruism does not

7\. **Their real innovation was to revive an outdated philosophy.** Nearly all of the major points of the books are updated versions of 18th century arguments. The history of the last 300 years has shown how dangerous some of those positions can be. They gloss over valid criticisms mostly by ignoring or cherry-picking the past.

*examples:* Dawkins updates the historical dialectic as a moral theory; Harris and Dennett undercut John Stuart Mill's rights of conscience; Hitchens espouses a Freudian interpretation of religion.

8\. **They're committed to dividing society up along partisan lines.** The books are preoccupied with classifying the right people as atheists

*examples:* Dawkins extends to fight over Einstein to include most scientists

9\. **They don't seem to realize that they are deeply conservative with respect to religion.** Like the Neoconservatives

*examples:* Harris gives the rationale for installing benevolent dictatorships as an element of foreign policy; Dennett suggests a name-and-shame campaign reminiscent of McCarthyism; Dawkins and Dennett suggest a legal rationale for removing children from otherwise non-abusive religious environments.

10\. **Atheists can do better.** No one need endorse books filled with that many specious arguments in order to make a case for secularism and toleration toward atheists. Ultimately

You know, have the one where God tells Abraham to sacrifice his only son. You wanna do a D'var Torah? Sure, here, have Korach.""

Korach. Wow. Ok, Abiram, and 250 of their closest friends decide that maybe the Kohanim shouldn't be the only family to have the right to be high-priest. They decide to stage a coup. God opens up the Earth to swallow them and their families whole.

Alright, I get it, God put the Kohanim in charge, and Korach and his friends were making a direct threat against the Kohanim themselves. Korach, too, was greedy - he wasn't saying ""Someone else should be in charge,"" he was saying ""*I* should be in charge."" And yes, and in war

But then came the next day,000 of them. For the crime of daring to question an injustice.

Whoa.

Someone once told me that the difference in Reform and Conservative and Orthodox Judaism is really a function of how those branches view changes in societal philosophy, but we'll never break the rule itself."" Conservative Jews say ""We know in our hearts that a change must happen, so we'll consult the wisdom of the Rabbis, and look for how they interpreted the intention of the Torah, and hopefully in so doing, we'll find a way to justify that change.""

And then you have Reform Jews, what's right. And what the Torah, this ancient script upon which I've built my entire Faith, this book containing the greatest wisdom of God Itself, is telling me about how to think and pray and live and believe is just . . . it's not. Right.""

If you're a fan of the T.V. show The West Wing, who was hoping that his President would commute the sentence of a man who was to be put to death that evening. When his congregant pointed out that the Torah says ""an eye for an eye"", his Rabbi said, ""You know what it also says? It says a rebellious child can be brought to the city gates and stoned to death. It says homosexuality is an abomination and punishable by death. It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking reflected the best wisdom of its time, but it's just plain wrong by any modern standard.""

This. This is why I am a reform Jew. Because I'm far too busy devoting my time and energy to the brand of Judaism that is focused on fixing the World than to waste one second questioning whether any great Wisdom about loyalty and keeping your mouth shut can be gleaned from these words. For whatever reason God had at the time, it would be Pol Pot, it would be Hitler. And I would fight it with my last dying breath.

Don't get me wrong. I love and revere My God, then congratulations, you've learned to think for yourself. And maybe you now understand that this book was written, in part, for another people, in another time. And that's not to say you should abandon it, it's still a gift, but you now have the tools to see which words were meant for you

My words may sound blasphemous. Even treasonous. And if they are, just as God gave us bread from the Earth by giving us all of the tools and skills and knowledge to make bread, so did God give us wisdom from the Torah by giving us the tools and skills and knowledge to find it. Our every breath and footfall are given to God - this notion is so engrained in our Judaism that we say ""Adonai s'fatai tiftach. Ufi yagid t'hilatecha."" ""Adonai, open up my lips, that my mouth may declare your praise.""

Well, in five thousand years of study of Torah and supplication to God's commandments, been granted the right to question the unjust, no matter how Mighty?

I used IHDI rather than HDI to adjust for countries with great income disparities where rich pull the index down and poor pull the crime rate up. 

I also used murder rates rather than rapes or some other crimes

All of the data came from Wikipedia

[Importance of religion by country]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_of_religion_by_country)

[List of countries by intentional Homicide rate]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)

[List of countries by IHDI]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI)

Regression was done with Excel regression tool. 

Results:

Regressing IHDI against murder rate gives us a slope of -11.2 and a p-value of 16%. That means that for every one unit increase in IHDI there is a drop in murder rate of 11

Regressing religiousness by murder rate gives us a slope of 6.2 and a p-value of 36%. That means that with every unit increase of religiousness

Now it’s known that both religion and crime correlate with the standard of living which means that they should also correlate with each other. So by regressing murder rate with both IHDI and religiousness at the same time

The result is that for IDHI, or if anything, religion decreases murder rates. 


You can see the [data and the results](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuPWO5hhHGHJdHVUTkFJM2hDdEJ6cTRDeGx6YWJZTkE&amp;hl=en) in this Google spreadsheet. Note that there is more than one tab at the bottom. If you want to know what those other variables are

I'm 37 now.  This is really hard for me to describe

I'm educated in the sciences, and I know that they are.  I see life all around me and recognize the similarities and truly believe that they evolved along side my species.  I'm not saying science has 100% explained anything, I know for a fact we're probably wrong about everything.  But that's how science works.. and I believe in the struggle to understand through logic, even if it means making a lot of mistakes.

I've read the Bible (both books) a long time ago

I have this feeling in me that won't go away.  I find myself overwhelmed with emotion sometimes when I'm by myself in nature. I feel like there is *something* there

But the holy books read like something written by a human- they are more concerned with population expansion and politics than they are about understanding our place in the universe.  They don't feel in any way divine to me.  And every time I speak to a ""holy man"" regardless of their denomination/religion they just come across as being very opinionated and stuck on a handful of irrelevant (and to my mind

The thing I'm trying to understand feels big and profound

So I'm here on Reddit asking if anyone else is as lost as I am. I know its a journey that probably has no destination. Maybe I'm just looking for some company along the way.

7. As far as I know

  * Is not a scientific theory (irrefutable)

  * Does not refute any known

2. I **do** believe that the world is ""created"" by a unified entity

**DO NOT** accept their literature just to get rid of them

To a Jehovah's Witness, they're hoping that *you will be* after you read what they've given you.  They are instructed to follow-up with *everybody* they place literature with, so accepting said literature only gives them the wrong impression.


**DO NOT** just say ""I'm not interested""

They may say thank you and leave


**DO NOT** say ""I have my own religion""

Jehovah's Witnesses don't knock on doors looking for other Jehovah's Witnesses. They are specifically targeting people who don't share the same beliefs.  That's what recruiting is.  While you might think telling them that you're a Catholic or a Hindu is going to get them to back off


**DO NOT** hide

Jehovah's Witnesses divide their local area up into territories. Each territory is worked every six months if possible. In order to consider a territory to be ""worked, as someone who did their door-to-door recruiting thing for the first two decades of his life, I can assure you that *they know when you're hiding.*  Most people really, really suck at it.  Seriously.  After standing at your door for a few minutes they go back to their car and laugh at you.


**DO NOT** assume your ""No Solicitors"" sign will stop them

A solicitor is someone who is selling a product or service. While it is true that Jehovah's Witnesses used to sell their religious literature,"" but receiving their publications is not contingent on you giving a donation.  A Jehovah's Witness will give you anything they're offering without you paying a cent, and legally this is not soliciting.  They know this, and routinely ignore ""No Soliciting"" signs.


**DO NOT** open the door naked

They might be flustered, chances are if you run into a sufficiently jaded JW, they're not going to believe you anyway.


**DO** post a ""No Trespassing"" sign clearly visible on your property

Until a few decades ago it was legal for anyone to walk to your front door and knock without it being considered trespassing.  That ruling has since changed and Jehovah's Witnesses were advised many years ago that violating such a sign is now done *at their own individual risk* and that their organization would not help them with any legal troubles as a result.  If a JW knocks on your door despite the No Trespassing sign


**DO** ask to be placed on their ""do not call"" list

Jehovah's Witnesses keep ""do not call"" records for every territory, and B) you still feel the same.


**MAYBE** tell them you're disfellowshipped

Jehovah's Witnesses are not supposed to talk to disfellowshipped (a.k.a. excommunicated) former Witnesses. Most of the time, and if a church elder is at your door, he may start to probe you for information. Use this at your own risk.

The definitions following are the modern usage of the words. 

- Theist: Belief in a deity. 

- Atheist: Lack of a belief in a deity. 

- Gnostic: Position that we can ultimately know whether or not a god exists. 

- Agnostic: Position that we can't ultimately know whether or not god exists. 

Gnosticism can also be known as a ""Strong position"" and Agnosticism known as a ""Weak position."" 

So people can be 1 of 4 things. 

- Gnostic Theist: Belief that a god does exist

- Gnostic Atheist: Belief that a god doesn't exist

- Agnostic Theist: Belief that a god does exist

- Agnostic Atheist: Lack of a belief in a god because we can't ultimately know if one exists. 

Many religious people and theists are Gnostic Theists. 

Most self-proclaimed atheists and agnostics are Agnostic Atheists. 

How to tell what you are: 

*Do you personally hold a distinct belief in a deity of any sort?* 

- If you do not believe in a deity

- If you do believe in a deity

*Do you believe your position is absolutely correct?* 

- If you do

- If you don't

Think about it this way. Which one of these do you agree with the most? 

- I know God exists. (Gnostic Theist) 

- I know God does not exist. (Gnostic Atheist) 

- I think God exists. (Agnostic Theist) 

- I think God doesn't exist. (Agnostic Atheist)

Problems may occur when defining ""deity."" Deity is typically defined as: a recognized preternatural or supernatural immortal being, or sacred, held in high regard, and respected by believers.

Here is a chart.

Within the terms theism and atheism, pantheism, apatheism, etc.

Edit: Well now

discovered the connection of Being in Nonbeing.

What was described above it
Bearers of seed there were and mighty forces
thrust from below and forward move above.

Who really knows? Who can presume to tell it? 
Whence was it born? Whence issued this creation? 
Even the Gods came after its emergence. 
Then who can tell from whence it came to be?

That out of which creation has arisen
whether it held it firm or it did not
He who surveys it in the highest heaven
He surely knows - or maybe He does not!""

Not only does this poem come from possibly the oldest book ever ~1300BC, something I haven't thought about in such a way.

I’ll tell you that I was in Texas, and the idea that Christ was returning extremely, extremely soon.  Often members would come and report on visions or dreams that they had to be interpreted. There was also an obsession with angels and demons. Several “gifted” members, namely the leader’s wife and oldest daughter (my age) would have visions of angels while around the rest of the group and would converse with them, asking them questions on the behalf of the ungifted members, treating the angels like oracles. The leader would report to having seen visions of demons and taught that demons lived inside of people and caused them to sin. This belief led to exorcisms becoming weekly common-practice. These aren’t exactly like what movies show them as, but usually involved extended periods of laying hands on members while praying in tongues. The recipients of the prayer would often react violently speak on behalf of the specific demon that was inside of them. The people praying would speak to the demons, “spirit of rebellion”


This “cult” reached it’ climax when the leader’s eldest daughter reported seeing angel armies marching through the house we were in, etc. I think when we went back to our lives after this, people realized how crazy it all was and we haven’t met since. 


Feel free to post questions.

It is slightly misleading because Cavanaugh's argument (as he is at pains to repeatedly make clear) is not that religious people hardly every commit violence at all, is a myth in both senses of the word.**

1. It's a myth in the sense of a falsehood in that religion is simply not analytically separable from 'secular' parts of society like economy, the crusades, is hopelessly anachronistic and simply not helpful.
2. It is a myth in the sense of a foundational narrative to justify certain societal arrangements, modern secular states often draw upon the narrative of how ""religion"" is especially prone to irrational violence in order to justify its own policies regarding peoples who are described as being religious. In the words of Cavanaugh:

*""But what is implied in the conventional wisdom is that there is an essential difference between religions such as Christianity, and Judaism, on the one hand, and secular ideologies and institutions such as nationalism, Marxism, capitalism, and liberalism, and that the former are essentially more prone to violence—more absolutist, and irrational as those labeled religious. It is dangerous because it helps to marginalize, and natural a very contingent set of categories—religious and secular—that are in fact constructions of the modern West.
