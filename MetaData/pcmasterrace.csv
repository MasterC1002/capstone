He still wasn't convinced (typical teenager), he thinks about $5000+ Alienware machines.

Needless to say

When he started spouting off BS about how the graphics in PC games are not that much different from consoles

http://imgur.com/a/1BwD7

When I asked him what his most played game was, I loaded up both the PC and console versions of each game side by side.

His jaw, with graphics cranked up to their max settings.  Now, CoD isn't the most graphically intensive game out there, especially Black Ops which uses the old CoD:MW1 engine while MW3 has the newest one, but giving it the good ol' PC treatment still makes it look good.  I explained to him that most console games from this generation didn't display real 1080p, because it wasn't common in 2006, and the hardware couldn't support it.

When he started to defend the next-gen consoles about their hardware and how they will do actual 1080p, while the new consoles will have impressive specs, us PC gamers have had similar hardware for the past 2 years.  And in the next 2 years, we have even better machines.

Then he asked about the price of making one of these PC rigs.  I showed him my current one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1g9k7i/build_complete_my_new_2013_amd_build/

It's is a little bit more expensive that what most people spend, and an OS.

He saw the light.  Even his Dad was impressed by what people can build.  So, and I'm going to be helping them build in the next few weeks.

My evangelist mission is complete.

The Steam Sale is upon us

If you just built or bought your first gaming PC, and the satisfaction of gaming accomplishment. An entire world of superior graphics, customization, game experiences, community, and entire history of gaming awaits you. We welcome you! This is a community to flaunt your rig’s performance, share awesome PC gaming content, and smugly bask in the hellish glow of a thousand red rings of death. 


**r/PCMasterRace Glossary**:

**PC Master Race**: a term coined by Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw to satirically coin the attitude and sense of superiority that PC gamers have over console-only gamers.

**Gaben**: Gabe Newell

**Console Peasant**: A console-only gamer. PC gamers generally look down on console gamers as lazily settling for second best in terms of performance and gaming experience. Console gamers are considered low skill and immature.

**Filthy Casuals**: Gamers content to play exclusively mobile or social media games only

**Blasphemy**: Anytime a console gamer attempts to claim platform superiority

**Ascension**: Building/buying your first PC gaming computer.

**Gaben Shrines**: a powerful PC gaming setup. Also known as a Command Center or Battlestation.

**Mac Heretics**: Mac users. Mac hardware is often substandard and developed in a closed development environment

**“Half-Life 3 Confirmed”**: The third installment of the popular and influential Half-Life has not been officially announced

**YouTube Comment Threads**: “But what about that shadowy place?” “That's beyond our borders. You must never go there

**The PC Master Race Commandments**

1.	A PC gamer is made by owning a PC gaming rig
2.	Screenshots and build specs or no ascension.
3.	There is no such thing as too powerful or too high.
4.	There is nothing more superior than treating a lady gamer with class and respect. We are all more equally superior to the console masses.
5.	Do not suffer a shitty port to live.
6.	Thou shalt mod as thou wish. 
7.	Be loyal to quality games
8.	Multiplayer will not tolerate childish behavior
9.	Thou shalt use [pcpartpicker.com](http://pcpartpicker.com/) to find the best deals on hardware. 
10.	Thou shalt help others ascend. We are a community who shame the willfully ignorant

Notice how the some of responders are recommending a builder like CyberPowerPC?  Why?  Why are you recommending this shitty builder?  Is this really the only experience you've had with PC gaming?  Buying from a horrid builder like them?  They don't even recommend high-end builders like Falcon Northwest, or Maingear which, at least, have a reputation for great builds, the problem being the high costs for that excellent work.

And there are many other posts just like this in which people are proudly claiming their pre-builds as being superior gaming machines.

I'm sorry

You want to know why other PC subreddits never recommend a pre-built system?  Because it does you no good in the long run.  Ever.

For the new console plebeians entering into PC gaming, go buy a console.  It works right out of the box, and there is no work involved for you.

And it's even worse to get a pre-built

The absolute worst is when someone buys a ""gaming PC"", ""Where's the performance that I was promised for going PC?"".  CyberPowerPC and other builders are **very** guilty of these kinds of shenanigans.

So in the eyes of a console gamer

In my mind, then you're just going to experience frustration after frustration during your time with it.

And the thing is, building a machine in the Windows 98 days, and it was a real pain in the ass, but I eventually got it to work, and I never looked back since.

I know that this subreddit is a circle-jerk.  We make jokes about the console peasants and their horrid ad revenue machines; while extolling the virtues of the glorious PC master race, troubleshooting, and advice regarding the world of PC gaming, then we need to drop the bullshit and give actual **real** advice.

We need to set a standard here

For those who have not built their own machines yet

Build your own

Glorious rant over.

Any thoughts and opinions are welcome.

I'm betting the influx of our new brethren includes others that haven't been blessed by glorious Gaben before so here's the things you need to know about summer sales:

There are several types of Summer Sale deals:

* All sale deals: These will be available for the entire sale(Generally 10 days)
* Daily deals: Every morning at 10am PST the current daily sales will swap out for new ones.  If something is on daily deal that you want it's a good time to buy
* Flash deals: Flash deals last 8-12 hours cycling throughout the day
* Community Choice deals: again 8-12 hours long
* Pack deals: These packs will contain anything from a series to an entire publisher library at crazy low rates.  Sometimes with packs you can trade or give away any games from the pack you already own but I wouldn't count on it.  If the pack is a good deal for you
* Last day: The last couple of sales the last day, if you missed something you might get a second chance but it's no guarantee.

Additionally since the sales swap at 10am, sometimes switching to something insane (I usually use Romania) will actually net you better download speeds.  This won't affect your ability to buy games, just to download ones once you own them.

So there you have it brethren.  Get out there and enjoy the sales!  If there is an interest I could be talked into compiling daily deal lists for us but there's probably already someone doing a better job than I in /r/gaming.

Oh, etc) you can buy games on the sale through the steam website now, and then install them later once your system is complete.  Purchases are tied to account not to system.

There are also usually sale related goals and stuff to get steam badges,False,self,t5_2sgp1,False,,blue,t3_1i3dbj

1365262967.0,1bssio,Dear brothers and sisters.. I have to confess my sins.,SovietPootis,50,5,31,"Please help me! I am completely clueless what I should do!

So yesterday I had a caprice that I wanted to play a driving game. When I was one of those peasants few years ago I used to play A LOT of driving games with my Playstation 2

I was browsing my glorious Steam library and I noticed that have Dirt 3 which came with my glorious HD6950. I knew that driving a car with a keyboard is something terribad. Even though I knew what risks would occur if I did it

So

And I did it. I held the controller with both of my hands.

It was something familiar. Having sticks under my thumbs was something.. relaxing. L2 and R2 buttons were not familiar

So I started playing the game. I played it for three hours. Single-player. Rally. My god how good time I had.

After I stopped playing I had thoughts like ""What the Bioshock would be like If I played it with a controller? Or Diablo? Or how worse I would be if I played Planetside 2 with a controller? I doubt I wouldn't be so much worse that it wouldn't be relevant..""

At that moment I realized something terrible: the controller was indoctrinating me! I instantly dropped the controller and went to bathroom and washed my hands for 10 minutes. I had done something terrible. The controller was influencing by spitting me it's heretics thoughts! Was it trying to turn me slowly into lifeless peasant who would play Call of Duty and pre-order all the DLC!

PC vs. Console Gaming: An Eternal Struggle

   Video games have become an integral and defining aspect in the lives of many of the world's children, one of the first video games ever released, to Blizzard's “World of Warcraft,” the world's most popular online video game today, video games have evolved exponentially in terms of quality, complexity, popularity and profitability.  They have built a legacy that will last forever, but pose a question:  How will you play them?  Personal Computers (PC's) were the first to be able to develop and play video games, invading living rooms and stealing gamers' attention.  Consoles offer a more budget-friendly alternative to PC's, PC's are far superior to consoles.
   
   To put things bluntly, PC's are expensive, but for all of the right reasons.  Joel Gregory illustrates this point in a simple allegory, ""PC gaming is your hundred-grand supercar: pretty, expensive, and absolutely not for everybody.  Consoles are your mid-range hot hatches: reasonable, reliable,  whereas not a single PC, which can add up quickly
   
   Even if money is not an object, or invite 3 of your friends to bring their own tiny controller over so you can all sit together on the couch and look at the same screen?  In the words of Mark Tiongco, ""Even though Madden 2011 is available for PC, most sports fans would rather play it on an Xbox 360/PS3 because of the easier gamepad.... Furthermore, fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe are more socially preferred [on consoles] as everyone is usually huddled around a big-screen television.""  Also, motion-controlled gaming on the Wii, Xbox Kinect, while PC gamers have to be glued to their desk chairs.
   
   In addition to cost efficiency and social potential, and you have quite the perplexing array of options, which might intimidate potential gamers.  The Xbox 360's controller, on the other hand, has 4 buttons, a four-way directional pad, 2 thumb-operated joysticks, for a grand-total of 14 individual commands, and uses the same format of discs.  “Therefore
  
   While it is unfair to say that consoles do not have their merits, ensuring you always have a purring beast of a gaming machine.  The creaking legs of Xbox 360 and PS3 can’t keep up with newer games.  They’re stuck with the same hardware as seven years ago, hiding their wrinkles behind gimmicks"" (King).  What this means is that games have to be dumbed-down to be able to play on these outdated consoles, while at the same time are optimized to utilize the very best that high-end PC's have to offer (Tiongco).  When comparing the numbers, processing power on the GPU, which stands for Graphics Processing Unit, adds up to only 250MHz on the Wii, and 550 MHz on the PS3.  The typical mid-range PC's GPU can reach speeds over 1GHz, the announced PS4, it can be concluded that PC's will remain in their own league for some time to come.  A rule of thumb when buying electronics
   
   The next addition to the PC's superior characteristics is community.  All console games are created on a computer, and these allow anything from visual enhancement via texture packs to the ability to turn dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bifmj1O3D24)  Next, the Steam client has been introduced to connect PC gamers in a manner similar to the console's interfaces, while offering periodic sales of up to 95% off video games.  These opportunities compensate significantly in the long run for the PC's higher initial cost (King).
   
   This paper has analyzed how PC's and consoles compare solely as gaming machines, download music, write papers, do research, conduct business, and edit photos and much more. Hence, its utility is plenty for a consumer. Second, a computer can be continuously upgraded with new hardware to accommodate new technologies and new games that take advantage of next-generation graphical eye candy"" (Tiongco).  While custom-built gaming desktop PC's have the best available performance, while at a lower quality.  Gaming PC's are superior to consoles

Since when do you have to spend a lot on graphics cards?  For heavens sakes spending around $150 will get you a GPU that functions very well.  I mean its no GTX 770, which, for the most part, is enough for my low income situations.  Teenager here....anyway!

And ""YOU NEED TO UPGRADE"".  This is such a stupendously hypocritical statement.  The console peasant blasting PC's because they need to be upgraded.  GahhhhHHHH!!!! You don't *need* to upgrade.  I mean, but I guess for PC gamers you can easily tell when the next AAA title is more graphically demanding.

Yes, say the next console releases, you will still, STILL have a better graphical experience than that of the console player.  **It is the console peasant, who is stuck with stagnate hardware, bashing PC's for the ability to upgrade.  The ultimate definition of hypocrisy and peasantry.** ",,self,,

Instead, and the big projector screen behind him lights up.  The number 3 appears.  Everybody gasps.  Quiet words are uttered.  

Is it what everyone hoped?  Is it here?

Instead, but a new Team Fortress is a welcome surprise by all, and the trailer shows TF being played on a new engine.  Everyone suspects that it's the new Source 2 engine.  Looks great.  Trailer ends.  Applause all around.  Not bad.

Then the lights brighten.  Gaben is still there.  Still not saying anything.  Then he lifts his hand again.  Only this time

The lights dim, and fun.  Everything everyone expects from the L4D series.  New characters, including old ones, fighting side by side against hordes of infected.  Trailer ends.  Everyone applauds.  This is getting really good.

Lights brighten again.  Gaben is still there.  Still silent.  Everyone is now tense.

He lifts his hand in the air.  Some are now at the edge of their seats.  He now has three fingers extended.  The lights dim.

Is this it?  Finally?

We see the number 3.  And then we hear it.  He hear...... her.

""This is for science.""

The new trailer for Portal 3 plays.  The stage gets an audible sigh of regret.  Some are disappointed.  Portal 3 looks amazing.  New puzzles.  New modes.  More GLaDos.  It's an awesome trailer

Lights are up

What the hell is going on?  What is this?  Isn't this over?

Gaben looks at the crowd.  He lifts his hand.  He points one finger in the air.

Wait.....

He points another finger in the air.  Could it be?

He points a third.  Is it?

He extends four fingers into the air

You see the number 3 on screen

""Rise and Shine

Half Life 3's trailer starts playing, laughter, and chaos.  It is finally here.  It's done, and it's finally been revealed to us.  The one thing we've been waiting so long for.

It.  Is.  Here.

The trailer continues.  People are half trying to watch

The trailer ends.  Everyone cheers.  The sound is deafening

The lights brighten again.  Everyone wants to congratulate Gabe Newell.  But he's not there.  The stage is empty.

now people lets get some facts right:

- 99.9% of the time the GPU is the bottleneck in most games

- games that are CPU intensive are few and far between (apart from PS2 and civ i cant think of any)

- using current chips (ie anything better than a fx 4300 or a I3) you shouldnt get a bottleneck with a single card. (titans, intel core2 and the like should not give many major bottlenecks.

- most bottlenecks ive seen are from either REALLY slow HDD's

Because of sales, I brought the amount spent down to $96.72, resulting in an average cost of $1.90. 

That's an average 82.06% discount per game. In other terms

Praise the glorious Lord Gaben!

I think everyone should understand that companies such as Microsoft and Apple never really invented anything. They only bring already old technology to their clients. The technology invented by some one else - that was already available for years - but most people had no clue about.

Although we must admit these companies do bring technology to ordinary people who otherwise would be.. ""too stupid"" to acquire it. But we all should be aware

Back durings its launch on PC, I have already moved on to other titles... until one day, thanks to GabeN, it was on a holiday sale and a friend purchased it for me. It sat in my backlog until I decided to play it.

Upon booting up the game for the first time, the other parts of consolitis remained. It definitely reminded me that us PC gamers had it pretty bad in terms of console ports, starting in 2007.

Hell

* COD4 not only marked the beginning of its dominance on consoles
* Crysis happened
* The rise of restrictive DRM. Starforce was probably the first prominent one that gathered negative attention

Thankfully, like FPS capping and FOV sliders. It also helps that we have a healthy indie scene as well. PC titles may not have completely regained their former glory selves, but they are slowly improving, and there's plenty of alternatives, from indies to PC-only developers/publishers (Paradox, Bohemia, etc.).

Seeing as the concept of a steambox is very small there not much room for an upgrade. Spending money on a prebuilt pc isn't something new. I can see how it would make the console to pc switch easier to adapt to but besides that it just seems like valve is trying to become Dell or HP by making a pc with little to no upgrading ability.

Any UPlay game, Hitman Absolution

SO, [The touchpad](http://imgur.com/0IrAFhk) could be used like a laptop trackpad, giving you a cursor to make your way around those pesky launchers, popups, etc. Of course it would take the proper software/drivers to allow your DS4 to function as a mouse AND gamepad. Sony could potentially sell thousands of controllers to people who will never own a PlayStation 4. Let's be honest though. Sony probably won't release the drivers and software to enable this. I realize this is a long shot so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that our wonderful dev community will realize this potential and make it happen!

I know significantly more about computer hardware than I did before I joined this glorious and exclusive brotherhood. When I wanted to get into PC gaming a couple of years ago


I pored over hardware information, tutorials, guides, shopping tutorials, infinity Google searches, hardware introductions, benchmarking websites, forums asking questions after question


I learned more about computers in those two-three months of research than I did anything in my last two years of high school, repetitive, and boring work, I could not have been more entertained. Because of that, I retained almost everything I read, something formal schooling has never been able to do for me.


One thing was for certain about 20% of the way through all that research. My original plan, borderline top-tier gaming machine that I would be proud of, and one that would blow consoles, even for a couple generations ahead, out of the water.


To do this I would need money


At this point I pored back into the research game to configure the exact specs that I would want for my new PC. I already knew how to build it from all the research I had already done. In two weeks, I was absolutely giddy.


The thing is, and achieve goals. And best of all, I learned what it takes to buckle down and do what has to be done to get what I want, without anybody's help but my own.


So in the end, very good thing. I am not mad or disappointed that I had to spend so much time and money to get where I am now in the gaming world, I am grateful. I have an appreciation for this type of technology that I didn't have when I was a console peasant.


I realize now that this is much, and I hope it stays like this for quite some time. Console players who can't afford to build the machines may feel bitter now, I did, but they will understand in the end.

Hey there

This questioning of the gaming laptop has always bothered and puzzeled me. I could have very well understood the distaste a long time ago when laptops were so severely underpowered that they couldn't do much for gaming

They may not be power houses, the Alienware m17X and M18X, The Clevo NP9000 series, the MSI GT60 and GT70. All of the have graphics cards capable of dealing with 1080P gaming.

So I have much curiosity at the distaste towards these systems. 

Back Story:
I've been a PC gamer for a very very long time, I remember my first build used Windows 98, My wallpaper was Cardcaptor Sakura. It was an ugly old machine, but I remember the Turbo button on it and everything. My first real video games I played were Age of Empires and A10Cuba on windows 98.

I built computers as a teenager usually for other people because of neighbors and what not because my dad said I could it for them for cheaper(That man was a freaking asshole, hated it so much). My first windows xp machine was a Pentium III 500mhz. Boy that was a crappy build, I don't even remember the graphics card. It was old though. I didn't have money so it was cheap. :/

My first serious gaming build was an Intel Core 2 quad QX6850 Extreme, god it was an insane jump from that Pentium III 500mhz. I mean it was insane, but it was nice for the draught I had for years, and it was all on my own money.(I was a teenager at the time).
I eventually ended up getting in a dispute with my pops and I got kicked out. The machine was lost to me and I couldn't build, i7 920, gtx 260. I loved that machine. It overclocked beautifully. Liquid Cooled. Then....  in 2012, Shit went bad for me. And yet again I lost my glorious desktop. at the time it was upgraded with a EVGA GTX570 1280MB and 12GB of Corsair Vengeance RAM. It ran every god damned game I could throw at it at 1080P without a hassle. I was so upset to lose it.

But I was wise about my situation and had picked up a little Alienware M11X for while I was out on Army duty back in early 2012.
It was a tiny little system that could handle league and WoW
But I saw its value when I lost my desktop(I was discharged from the US Army for medical reasons
Literally this little 11inch laptop saved my life


So I kept working and I ended up picking up a new Alienware m14X because I needed a quick cheap replacement with the same support that I had gotten before.
And this laptop is pretty good for its price.
i5 3210QM, 512GB SSD, 1600x900 screen, Intel Centrino 6250.($1250 including taxes and shipping)
It boots in 9 seconds

Guild Wars 2, a super bright screen, and I have never once seen this laptop hit above 67C in temps. And I've got MSI Afterburner overlays watching the GPU load and temps.
81~99% GPU load for a 5~6hours and its still hovering between 66 and 67. It handles well. I love how good this machine is.
Its compact. I can set it down
I've got a 4g wifi hotspot that I get just over 80ping with on league of legends.


Unfortunately the situation I live in now I can't build a desktop. I had the cash, but unfortunately I cant keep a desktop where I am. So I pooled my cash and desided to pick up a $2000 laptop, with $200 of upgrades and $120 of artwork I used my graphics design skills for the back of the laptop lid.

Its a beautiful laptop that's coming together with the help of a laptop modifier/Desktop Builder(Xotic PC).(artwork and mSATA SSD and os installations and quality check burn in done by xotic

i7 3630QM, 2x60Gb SSD(mSATA one Boot, one 2.5inch Caching) 750GB 7200RPM HDD, 1080P 72% NTSC screen, Artic MX-2 thermal compound. 

This laptop out paces my old desktop in gaming power. Its absolutely gorgeous with my own custom artwork. 
Its not been delivered yet
I've always had stability issues over the years and for me a laptop that can out pace the desktop I had back in early 2012... Its worth the extra cost and trouble especially when its got my own artwork on it and I'll never lose it as long as I keep it safe from being stolen.


Nowadays I'm absolutely obsessed with gaming notebooks/laptops. I love seeing a laptop pump up the graphics settings with their beautiful as a fucking goddess screen. I love seeing a laptop with a gaming mouse. I love the backlit keyboards and how beautiful they look in the dark... To see a glowing laptop with maxed out WoW or Guild Wars 2... Its such a glorious sight to be hold...
______________________________________________
 TL;DR
So here's the discussion I want to raise.
Why are the NoteBook/Laptop machines so looked down upon and down trodden for being Gaming Laptops?
Especially when they can handle modern games on high?


Some points to consider.
The Radeon HD7970M and GTX 680M both benchmark higher than P6000 on 3DMark11. Which is higher than the GTX 570 1280MB Reference designed graphics card offered in 2010~2012 for $360


That graphics card with an i7 Nehalem/sandybridge/ivybridge cpu @3.0ghz benchmarked at P5700 on 3dMark11.(Some people are even achieving P6700+ with the AMD HD7970M)
Which makes any laptop with a those top end cards more capable of 1080P gaming than desktops with the a GTX 560/570 ect.


Gaming laptops are very expensive. Mine was 2400$ final cost, speakers, can be unplugged for 4~7hours(If it has AMD Enduro or Nvidia Optimus and Ivybridge graphics), and it can be fit in a backpack or suit case complete with its power supply and gaming mouse+headset for under 17lbs/9KG(12lb laptop, 2lb power brick, mouse headset).
