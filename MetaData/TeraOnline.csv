So, some of it awful, some it isn't. This thread is for you brand new 60s, from the perspective of a launch veteran as well as a returning 60. Really it's the best of both worlds in terms of things that people already knew about, mixed in with all the new TERA: Rising content that we've been given. For convenience I've broken the guide down into sections, it turned out to be quite long because there is a lot of information you should know about. Unfortunately it took me awhile to write this, because the more I wrote

**Index**
*I. Making money*
*II. Which dailies should I focus on?*
*III. Glyphs*
*IV. Sleeper Gear vs. Keeper Gear*
*V. Nexus*
*VI. Gearing for PvP*
*VII. Masterworking*
*VIII. Preparing yourself for Hard Modes*

**I. Making money in TERA--------------------------------**
&gt;I'm sure by now you've seen some of the broker prices for top tier gear in TERA.  These numbers can seem pretty overwhelming

**Balder's Temple Sloths (aka monkies)**
&gt;Enter the Balder's Temple dungeon alone and turn left after the entrance. You'll see a field of sloths idling about. Kill these and sell the drops to the vendor. Repeat this for the Hard Mode instance. Come back and farm them again when your dungeon cooldown timer is open.

**Dailies**
&gt;Depending on whether or not you are Elite, sell items that can sell for quite a bit on the trade broker as well. Make sure you complete all of your dailies each day, and if you are Elite do not turn in your dailies until you have 18-20 ready and are able to activate your Quest Reward boost as well as your Reputation boost.

**Dungeon Drops**
&gt;Eventually you will begin doing dungeons at 60. Some of the drops in dungeons are quite valuable and a lot of new (or bad) players make the mistake of selling these items to vendors, do not ever ever ever ever sell T14 items to the vendor. You'll notice that they sell on the broker for as much as 10x their vendor value, because many other players require these items for enchantment fodder. Depending on whether or not you are on a PvP server, some T13 gear falls into this category as well. Be safe and always check the broker before selling dropped gear to a vendor.

&gt;Some other stats that often get seriously undervalued: x2 Attack speed on superior-quality enchantable weapons, Stun length reduction on earrings, attack speed on amulets. Always check the broker to see how much items with equivalent enchantments are going for before listing your item. Just because it lists for 600g does not mean your item is worth 600g.

**II. Which dailies should I focus on?-----------------------**
&gt;There are two faction reputations you should always invest in first: Unified Field Lab

&gt;The reason you are focusing on UFL and JT first is that these two factions can reward you with some seriously awesome items in comparison to the other factions in the game. Depending on your class, you are able to purchase gear that is almost as good as endgame +10 Nexus/Abyss gear. Obviously since they are missing enchantments they are not best in slot, but considering how little work you have to do to receive this gear you'd be a fool to pass it up. These chest pieces also have the same special bonus stats found on Regent armor, making them some of the best Sleeper gear in the game for certain classes.

&gt;Lastly both UFL and JT offer Rare and Superior quality enchantment fodder for purchase as you gain faction levels with them. Depending on your server

**III. Glyphs-------------------------------------------**
&gt;By now you should understand how the Glyph system in TERA works

&gt;There are two dungeons available to you at 60 that provide the currencies you'll need to purchase these glyphs: Temple of Temerity and Sirjuka's Gallery. Both dungeons sell different sets of glyphs (with some exceptions) so you'll need to do both in order to unlock them all. As well

&gt;While rare glyphs are not a necessity for progressing into Hard Mode dungeons

**IV. Sleeper Gear vs. Keeper Gear---------------------------------**
&gt;Sleeper gear is a term used for items that you don't plan on keeping, your Keeper set is the set you plan on Masterworking and enchanting to +12.

&gt;The easiest set of Sleeper gear you can get in TERA is the reputation armor from UFL or JT that I mentioned before. These items don't cost much and don't require an investment for enchantment. The Nexus is also a great way to earn Sleeper gear

&gt;Your Keeper gear in TERA will, Conjunct, Abyss or Regent gear. Ultimately everyone's dream Keeper set consists of a full set of Visionmaker armor and weapon. Make sure you research what the best non-Visionmaker items are for your class, as they can vary pretty wildly in terms of their costs.

&gt;For jewelry you will want to check reputation vendors to locate socketed rings that have a special stat specific to your role. For example the Shariar vendor has socketed rings with a special +1.5% damage stat, and MCHM. If you prefer to PvP, you can grind out Bellicarium credits to purchase Conquer Rings and Wind's Whisper earrings, which are just as good. Make sure you save some gold as these jewelry pieces often require you to re-roll their stats using Semi-Enigmatic scrolls, which can become quite expensive depending on your luck.

**V. Nexus------------------------------------------**
&gt;Nexus is a zone-wide event that spans across Khanovar Front, accepting the quest from the quest-giver, and helping complete each wave of a Nexus rift, with a bonus for completing all three. When the final Nexus in a zone is completed a special raid dungeon opens at that location. In order to enter, you must have been present for at least one final wave of a Nexus rift. This dungeon drops T13/T14 fodder, T13 PvP gear, and sometimes T14 Agnitor gear. In order to enter you must have at least 7 people inside the dungeon, groups are easy to find and the dungeon itself is not very difficult even with 7 people.

&gt;The gear provided by the Agnitor reputation merchant is almost as good as the dungeon equivalent Abyss gear, Conjunct gear. If you've completed your PvE or PvP gear already, Agnitor reputation is also an excellent way to purchase Master Enigmatic scrolls, which you'll need to MW your Keeper gear.

**VI. Gearing for PvP--------------------------------------**
&gt;Speaking of Conjunct gear, Guild vs Guild, Battlegrounds, and 3v3 Arenas. Regardless of which you prefer, you will need the same items in order to prepare for each one. The first thing you must do is queue for battlegrounds. Get used to them, and get used to dying a lot in the process, because you're going to be spending a lot of time in there. The first set of PvP gear, is available from Bellicarum reputation merchants located in capital cities all over the world. I would suggest the Headquarters room in Kaiator

&gt;Once you've farmed your Victor's set and have stopped dying in one shot to everything, these will make the biggest impact on how long you live in battlegrounds and how much damage you deal.

&gt;Attend every single Nexus you can,  and a special crafting material from the Agnitor merchant for your Conjunct set. If you have purchased Elite status, make sure you use your Reputation Boost to drastically increase the rewards from the rifts, as well as the repeatable quest to kill the Nexus Traverse Boss.

&gt;Speaking of the Conjunct set, as well as special crafting materials from both Agnitor as well as Bellicarium. The process is lengthy so I won't get into it here. Once you've created your Conjunct gear, strongly consider Masterworking it and enchanting it to +12, as far as PvP is concerned Conjunct is basically your Keeper set.

**VII. Masterworking-----------------------------------**
&gt;Eventually you'll start to acquire pieces of your Keeper set and start looking to investing a lot of money in making them the best they can be. Part of this process is something called Masterworking, so I won't get too much into it here.

&gt;Do some research on the topic and do some preparation ahead of time by saving all the Master Enigmatic Scrolls you receive. Masterworking a piece of gear is essentially saying, this is the last piece for this slot"". Having a set of Masterworked gear feels fantastic, but it does lend a certain finality to playing TERA as you've essentially hit a wall in terms of gear progression. Choose the gear you want to Masterwork wisely, lest you make a horrific investment of money creating an item that is going to be replaced next week.

&gt;In regards to Visionmaker gear

**VIII. Preparing yourself for Hard Modes-------------------------------------**
&gt;Hard Mode dungeons are the real endgame of PvE in TERA. Your choices consist of Crucible of Flame Rank 3, and can wipe even seasoned groups in an instant.

&gt;Getting ready for these dungeons will require some work on your part

&gt;Really this section is devoted to me telling you to learn as much as you can about your class before you try to set foot in ACHM or MCHM. Some of the mechanics present rely heavily on you already understanding most of the mechanics in the Normal Mode equivalent of the dungeon. Other mechanics are in place to punish sub-optimal DPS setups or players that didn't pay enough attention while they were progressing.

That's most of what there is to know about the time you'll be spending in endgame TERA. Compared to launch, considering its length, and I'm also considering posting it somewhere more visible and permanent. If you have feedback or further questions, let me know and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.

 **Stage One** 
&gt;TERA as was released in Korea. This includes content up to and including Ebon Tower

**Stage Two** 
&gt;TERA as was received in North America/Europe. Included the level 60 cap increase

**Stage Three** 
&gt;Post-TERA:Rising and free-to-play. Includes Argon Corpus and Manaya's Core from post-Stage Two. Introduces Crucible of Flame

**-------------------------**
&gt;Unfortunately for you as a new or returning player who has yet to hit the level cap

**Tokens**
&gt;You'll collect a variety of these from Zone Quests as you level

* [Progress tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/7046)
* [Support tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/6445)
* [Frontline tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/15421)
* [Dedication tokens](http://teracodex.com/item/15420)

**Badges**
&gt;Before hitting 60 you may notice some badges popping up in your inventory as you clear dungeons. These are legacy items from Stage One that were used to purchase gear. Throw them out

* [Oxbow Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/5355)
* [Eldritch Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19984)
* [Gellid Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19985)
* [Duality Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19983)
* [Necrotic Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19982)
* [Trial Badge](http://teracodex.com/item/19981)

**Rare Items and Crafting Materials**
&gt;There are a few legacy crafting materials you may receive that have fallen out of use. Previously these were used to craft rare endgame gear during Stage One. Nowadays they're just around to confuse you.

* [Beast Hearts](http://teracodex.com/item/8475)
* [Killian's Chain](http://teracodex.com/item/15846)
* [Broken Phoenix Beak](http://teracodex.com/item/15845)
* [Necromancer's Orb Shard](http://teracodex.com/item/15847)

**Unused Crafting Materials**
&gt;You'll find these mats in high level zones

* [Aether Essence](http://teracodex.com/item/20731)
* [Osyo Fiber](http://teracodex.com/item/20732)
* [Mutated Silex](http://teracodex.com/item/20733)

**Suppression Orders**
&gt;Unless you plan on completing achievements like [these ones](http://i.imgur.com/Se8cIBC.jpg), BAM quests, and extra quest hubs you may have skipped.

**Golden Labyrinth to Akasha's Hideout**
&gt;One of the first things you'll hear if you ever queue for AH is, you need some of [these, Holy Potions of Protection](http://teracodex.com/item/5347). You can collect these as drops in Golden Labyrinth, which is another dungeon in the same level range as AH. While it's still barely possible to clear AH if one or two people in your party lack the Potion, sometimes it can cause way too much of a hassle.

**Torching Kelsaik**
&gt;During the Story Quests available near 58, point yourself at Kelsaik and activate the item from your inventory or from your hotbar.

**Willpower &amp; Killian**
&gt; When you are clearing Labyrinth of Terror for the Story Quest to kill Killian, renders you immune to the fear from the second last boss, as well as the fear from the statues that line the outside of the final boss's room. It's not a necessity for clearing the dungeon, but it certainly can make things go a lot faster for you. There is a merchant in Habere who accepts Traces of Fear dropped from mobs around the city in exchange for these same potions.

**Breaking ~~Bad~~ Bhaozurbas**
&gt;The culmination of the level 38 (I think) Story Quest rewards you with a [special item](http://teracodex.com/item/20009). This scroll is used inside of the Cultist's Refuge instance in order to unlock the hidden Argon boss

**Making smart purchases off the broker**
&gt;Depending on your server

&gt;Here is an example: the following two pictures illustrate prices for gear from the same instance.

* [Level 27 Superior enigmatic items](http://i.imgur.com/FIAXHzH.jpg)
* [Level 27 Rare items](http://i.imgur.com/szpkYDB.jpg)

&gt;As you can see
* First
* Second

&gt;Don't be a sucker and waste your money on items like those Superior pieces

**Crafting
&gt;It's going to be tempting while you are leveling to try your hand at crafting. The sad news I have for you is that this hobby is largely sidelined in TERA (with the exception of Alchemy). The easiest way to level a crafting skill to 410 is through the following method:

* [Accept crafting quest from any Mission Board](http://i.imgur.com/8wVHWYF.jpg)
* [Visit the quest NPC who provides you with some materials and a design](http://imgur.com/85ndu7U)
* [Purchase extra materials and craft the relevant item](http://imgur.com/Rc6p9Ht)
* [Return the quest](http://imgur.com/RFQK0GL)
* [Repeat](http://imgur.com/IY66Ug7)

&gt;Using this method costs you a small amount of gold in comparison to purchasing expensive runes or materials to try and afford the somewhat ridiculous material cost for crafting items. Once your crafting skill is up to 410 you are ready to craft Visionmaker gear designs

**Other things**
&gt;There are other things I can get into that entire guides have been written about already. I believed I've covered most of the more dangerous pitfalls you can fall into during your quest for 60. Make sure you bookmark this guide, or ideas to be included share them below and I will credit you accordingly as the guide is updated.

1336472205.0,tcqi2,TERA is the first MMORPG to get me excited in years...and I work in marketing. It's nice to be reminded I have a pulse. Anyone else think they were over MMORPGs/gaming and have been pleasantly surprised?,Askura,115,21,42,"Last night I got TERA

I made an Elin Warrior because

I have to admit initially I wasn't amazed; in fact I kind of thought to myself that the world looked a lot like Aion. 

Instead of reading about TERA like I had previously with other MMORPGs I just went with it. I ignored most articles and posts and just thought I'll honestly just give it a go. So I had no real expectations other than I knew it was a pretty MMORPG.

After the prologue I felt a bit...well a bit underwhelmed. TERA didn't set itself apart from anything I had played prior and I didn't feel particularly interested in the world lore. 

New island

It wasn't exactly groundbreaking but then I started to notice little things. Mainly the whole avoiding attacks aspect. Up until I started actually leveling I had not realised that I could actually weave in and out of attacks. I had assumed it was all stat based and because of this up until my discovery I had played it like any other game. 

Run up

Once I discovered this I spent a rather large amount of time simply testing the extent of this. I wanted to know just how much I could avoid simply by running in between attacks. I then started to find combat highly enjoyable because the damage I was taking was due to my inability to avoid being hit by enemy attacks.

In previous games I had always been annoyed by the randomness of taking damage. Even if I ran behind an enemy they manage to keep laying their hits on me if I had hate/threat/enmity. 

So when I found out that everything became essentially my fault I loved it. TERA gives you something a lot of games don't and that is accountability for your actions. As opposed to running up to an enemy and spamming everything I have; fights are now an intricate dance of dodge the hell out of everything because it's fun. 

In most MMORPGs I suffered from what I'm going to dub as combat avoidance syndrome

With combat such an enjoyment I actually took more of an active interest in the storyline

So much so I started another character, cup of tea in hand, and feel like crap. Because we didn't sleep and we rocked up every starter quest, watched every cutscene, and listened to what everyone had to say.


It was glorious and yes I will doing exactly that all over again tonight.


Coincidentally if you're on Samael we should be friends. (Couldn't get onto Essenia)

1337785403.0,u12os,Tera UI issue needs attention. No Developer feedback. Links and Info inside.,Kareeda,96,10,76,"The issue has been narrowed down by the community to the UI which uses the AutoDesk Scaleform UI.    
http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform    
       
Basically the UI isn't being rendered by the GPU and is hogging most the CPUs resources causing a CPU bottleneck. The GPU usage for most including me is around 30-50% at even the most intense moments in the game and having the settings at lowest or highest settings make no difference in the FPS. If people hide parts of their UI their FPS gets a bit better for each part hidden. And if people hide their UI completely (Ctrl + Z) peoples FPS doubles/triples and the GPU usage goes to 70-100%. The issue apparently didn't exist in Close Beta and was introduced during Open Beta/Head Start. The Scaleform UI is capable of Multicore and GPU rendering so it should just be a matter of enabling GPU rendering or something along those lines. I just know that this is hindering many peoples enjoyment of the game including mine. As fun as tanking 60 dungeons is with no UI it'd be nice to see my HP and stuff....

I understand the game is still new and I'm sure the developers are busy getting content ready. But there is a large UI issue that is plaguing many people and there has yet to be a single response acknowledged by a moderator or anyone that can get the word to the devs. This same issue happened in Batman: Arkham City and was fixed with a patch so we know it's fixable... The Devs just need to know it's a problem.

Here is a list of just a few of these post. The largest one being on the Tera EU forums and is the most active and largest post there (300+ post)

Don't get me wrong. GF is terrible, explanation. But it just doesn't happen. And TERA doesn't happen with GF. You're sitting there in the forums, searching for a solution. People trying everything, getting no responses, reinstalling their game. And GF either doesn't know the problem because they're sleeping or they (more likely) don't care.

**Skill Summary**

Level 60 Slayer here

1. Whirlwind- This is a high damage skill and is actually the hardest hitting skill you have IF you land both spins

2. Heart Thrust- This is your main damage skill

3. Knockdown strike- This has a very high knockdown rate against everything (even BAMS occasionally) and helps you put out A LOT of damage when things are on the ground.

These three skills are your combo *starters*

Other skills include

1. Overhand Strike- A lot of damage especially with reset glyph which is pretty essential

2. Startling Kick- This skill is primarily used as an interrupt during a big animation from a BAM OR when your main three combo starters are on cooldown.

3. Stunning Backhand- Same as above

4. Retaliate- Use it when you get knocked down to get up faster and potentially knock things down around you (Tip: Occasionally something will knock you down 2 or more times in a short time period

5. Leaping Strike- Use this when something gets knocked down for damage or as a gap closer

6. Distance Blade- Use it as a gap closer

7. Backstab- You get his at 56 and just use it to get behind the target and temporarily immobilize them

8. In Cold Blood- Unlocked at 58 you simply use this for a large power boost

9. Overpower- This literally adds 30% extra damage onto your next skill, HT ideally

10. Evade-This is an invincibility frame, or through it while it goes off, avoiding all damage. More or less just do what the name implies and evade things with it

11. Headlong Rush- Use this to avoid some skills and also you can use it to set up a WW or a KDS faster

12. Dash- Use it to run faster during combat

13. Triumphant Shout/Tenacity- Use them for mana

14. Measured Slice- This is your 60 skills, and is pretty easy to land, so try to land it


**Combos**

As I already said, and KDS. So a good combo will typically look like this:

(optional) Cold Blood&gt;Overpower&gt;HT&gt;OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

(optional) Cold Blood&gt;Overpower&gt;WW&gt;OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

KDS&gt; (If knocked down) Leaping Strike&gt; (Skip straight here if not knocked down) OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

Startling Kick&gt; OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice

Stunning Backhand&gt; OHS&gt; (Once 60) Measured Slice


The important thing to note about slayer is **be flexible**. These combos all work and work well

Personal Favorite Combo:

Overpower&gt;HT&gt;OHS&gt;Measured&gt;WW&gt;OHS&gt;KDS &gt;Leaping Strike&gt;OHS&gt;
(If up) HT&gt; Startling Kick/Stunning Backhand&gt; auto/run and wait for cooldowns

This seems like a really long combo (and it is) but this should give you an idea of what playing slayer should be like, or I may lead with a headlong rush&gt;WW and use HT later. It all depends on the situation, which is where you need to decide what to use. 

**Glyphs/Crystals/Tips**

Solo leveling crystals: Vigorous armor crystals and Brilliant weapon crystals will help you with mana problems (which you often will have starting fights) and health problems (seriously the regen is so worth it)

Dungeons (monsters): hunters weapons crystals and stalwart armor crystals

Dungeons (BAMs): Savage, and Carving weapon crystals and anarchic armor crystals, this will increase your damage output FRO BEHIND, so get behind targets (backstab is good for this) and reduces damage from BAMs, which is necessary if you don't want your party to say: tank: heal please  healer: srry, shit slayer needs lots of heals

Powerful Zyrks should be used whenever possible (not until you have jewelery slots though). Also crystals get expensive

Glyphs are largely preferenced based

All three heart thrust glyphs

Glyph of carving for whirlwind

overhand strike 50% eliminate cd (get master glyph is possible

Glyph of carving on measured slice (not a masterwork YAY) and glyph of power us good but optional

Glyph of carving on overpower (unfourtunately another masterwork glyph)

One last important tip is to make sure that you aren't in front of the BAM if you don't have to be

A great resource that helped me lots is a [a slayer guide from Tera forums](http://tera-forums.enmasse.com/forums/slayer/topics/GUIDE-Brolys-Slayer-Guide?page=1)

**TL;DR: If you are currently playing slayer or want to learn actually read this

Edit: Once you are getting close to level 60 people have different ideas on what gear is good to buy as a new 60, which is cheaper and just used until you can afford better gear (I.E. Regents set). If you are not an elite player and are just f2p/founder it is probably better to use a T13 set and +9 it, but if you do have elite I would recommend saving your gold and buying Jax Trust gear, which you unlock with daily credits. It will take 1800 credits from there, and therefore about 10-14 days of daily quests, but the gear is very good and will let you hold onto your cash to save up for a regents set.",,self,,

1338299832.0,uabjn,What TERA needs to survive and grow long-term.,Atranox,73,16,106,"First off


* GvG is really fun and it's one of the aspects that separates TERA from other games. However, all that's at stake is your guild's reputation (if even that)...and with how many guild wars are going on, who really is keeping track of all of the winners/losers anyways?  Do you **really** care if your guild wins or loses?  Maybe a little, but probably not as much as you should.  I believe that the winner in the GvG should reap some form of reward.  Guilds should *want* to win and guilds should hate losing.  What GvG needs is a real competitive draw.  That's how rivalries are formed and that really would be the first step forwards bringing GV to the next level.  However, rewards need to be **meaningful**...not just some simple fluff or tacky rewards which don't add up to much.


* I think that EME and Bluehole could take a page from both DAoC and EVE Online's PvP systems and work on some form of adaptation that can apply to the TERA world.  Just imagine this combat system combined with open-world castle sieges, etc.  I think that they could potentially mesh very well with the Vanarch system.  I believe that a robust system such as thing would take a long time to implement properly, but it would fit within the game's style very, very well.  **This** is something that would honestly bring TERA to a whole new level, as it would provide tons of replayability and longevity to the end-game.


* Raids.  Not everyone loves raids, I think that difficult 10-man or 20-man PvE raids would provide a lot of longevity for the game's PvE players.  5-mans can only hold interest for so long because the scope is much smaller and they don't require a total guild effort.  With TERA's mechanics, raids can be made to be very difficult without the need to make them total grindfests.  Raids would really help solidify long-term PvE guilds.


* Simply put


* Difficult achievements and vanity/aesthetic awards.  Achievements and vanity awards always provide great ""side"" things to work on, hunting the rare Time Lost Proto Drake for the mount, grinding meaningful reputation for rare rewards, etc.  TERA already offers some of this to a degree - but more is always better!  I would even suggest guild and player housing, as they're fun timesinks to allow players to show off their achievements.


* A little more class customization would be nice.  Each class is very unique as it is, but I do feel that a little more customization could go a long way if balance can be maintained.


* The Vanarch system needs to have more to it.  Right now...basically Vanarch can disable vendors, and I have a feeling that outside of guilds that are running for office, nobody is really going to care.  Player X and Y aren't going to care much if some vendors are missing or if they have to pay a few extra silver to use the healer.  I think that the Vanarchs should have a lot more control over the region.  Perhaps this can tie in with some of my prior suggestions?

This is long

I've played kTera (without understanding much of what was being said for the longest time) and started playing on the USA servers recently. I've acquired a level 60 Priest after some two weeks of casual play and wish to present some party/raiding etiquette 101 because I notice a lot of newer players lacking knowledge in this department. 

I've played as a healer for a very long time in various MMORPG's. I've been in some of the top guilds since Vanilla WoW, Rift, kTera, Flyff (I was young and needed something simple coughflyffcoughorriblegamecoughstayawaycough) and now I'm working my way up the reputable ladder of Tera USA. I'm going to share my experiences with you because I've noticed with the exception of only TWO MMORPG's I've played (Ragnarok online and Guild Wars 2) that there are standard mechanics people can follow in order to succeed in dungeons.  I feel that with this subreddit garnering a lot of attention from the game recently going F2P that I should provide some general insight from my personal experiences. 


Lastly


I will include diagrams drawn by yours truly with my mediocre paint abilities to provide visual examples.


What are these aspects I speak of? 


* Dodging and parrying (certain DPS)
* Memorizing attack patterns
* Positioning
* Stacking
* Moving in unison
* Killing ADD's.
* Backing out when necessary.
* Telling everyone it's your first time in a dungeon or raid.
* Taking advantage of other players experience through thoroughly written guides and videos posted throughout the internet
* Notes


Lets begin.

**Dodging:** Every class has a dodge or a back step. Some classes have a way to defend themselves further from oncoming attacks (I'm lookin' at you, and lancers). There should be no reason for any class to take on excess damage. Excess damage means more mana spent on healing, which puts a strain on healers when they should be conserving themselves for more desperate situations, not for situations that can be avoided. I like to call this problem preventing.


Once again


**Attack Patterns:** Every. Creature. In. This. Game. Has. An. Attack. Pattern. With that said, preventing unnecessary damage by DODGING will make your life and everyone else's life easy. 


By the time you hit 60 you should have a very clear understanding of your class in dungeons. There should be no exception to this rule for anyone who's hit 60, someone else leveled that toon for you. 


And with leveling comes experience -- not experience that you need to level, bosses, et cetera. You generally refight the same BAM's and bosses over and over again with few exceptions (which will be highlighted later on). You should be able to look at all the mobs in Ebon Tower, Crucible of Flame, and whatnot and say to yourself, ""Damn, these bosses feel familiar"".


Which is why you should be able to DODGE and AVOID unnecessary damage.


I can tell you that Mystics


**Positioning:** This is very important as well. There's no reason a healer should have to chase you to the other side of the room and remove themself from range of the tank and other party members because you're unnaware of your surroundings and position yourself far away from the group and the healer. You should ALWAYS be in range of your tank and healer. I can't tell you how many lives could have been saved with proper positioning. I tire of seeing disgusting accusations because you're in San Francisco when everyone else is in Texas.


Healing takes time. Sometimes we suffer extreme damage in our fights. From experience, life is much easier when they can instantly click and purge a group instead of running around to target everyone.


With the utilization of dodging, even the most difficult of dungeons should be clear able. Yes, there is ilevel to consider and there exist people with characters so powerful that these points can almost be avoided -- up until you enter the TRUE end-game of Tera, Hard Mode Dungeons, but for the most part, even if it's a breeze for players, these procedures should be commonly practiced until they become habit. 


Positioning for the melee DPS should be to the side or behind the boss, and the tank should be facing the boss away from the group entirely. 


**Stacking:** This one is my favorite. Stacking is a concept that's existed in MMORPG's for a very long time. DPS will stack in Point A


This makes it easier for you to continue with DDPSing the boss (Dealing Damage Per Second) and for me to heal you and the tank to transition back into steady tank'n'spank after purging you of whatever ails you. Mystic's have a target-able purge (2 without glyph, even single targeting becomes easier. Positioning yourself in range of the tank (so that he may grab aggro) and near your healer (so that you may live through excessive damage) makes partying a pleasure, instead of having everyone disoriented and running around like a chicken with its head cut off. 


**Moving in unison:** This is a concept I learned in Ragnarok and I refined in World of Warcraft. Basically the idea is to move together and position yourselves thoughtfully. In World of Warcraft, mitigating the brute of the attack or completely avoiding it while preparing themselves to receive lovely healing from their priests. The add's are usually killed the moment they're spawned or kited to death by ranged DPS (in Tera, that's Sorc's, Archers), and seldom touch the healer, allowing the healer to focus on their objective -- which is to keep the party and raid alive. 


Even if you may not get this to work in pugs or random people you'll tackle an instance and raid with


**Killing ADD's:** Add's is a term used for minions spawned during fights which target whatever grabs aggro first. In most cases, which focus on add control. The moment add's are spawned there should be no reason in the world that they should ever reach your healer. If your healer has to kite said adds and suffers damage which forces the healer to focus heal themselves and/or inevitably die which may cause the tank or dps to die and eventually wipe, that is due to sheer negligence. Moral of this point is that you shouldn't let minions reach your healer. Ever. 


**Backing out when necessary:** We've all seen that one guy who takes x amount of damage and isn't healed instantly because of reasons who decides to stay in the fight a bit too long and dies. Often they decide to ridicule the healer or the tank but the truth of the matter is that you should have just backed out. Walk away for a moment to get topped off. Normally when I'm raiding or doing dungeons this only happens to people who aren't positioned well at all. They lack map awareness and despite knowing they're a good distance from the healer

Never be that guy.

**Taking time to tell everyone that it's your first time in a dungeon or raid:** This. This a thousand times. You can avoid so many problems by having a more experienced person in your party explain proper procedure. You should listen intently and learn from their experience. There is NO shame in telling your party that this is your first time in a dungeon.

**And lastly -- Taking advantage of other players experience through thoroughly written guides and videos posted throughout the internet:** In World of Warcraft our raid leaders spent a lot of time linking us videos and taking a moment to enlighten us on the boss fight. As a raid leader

There's guides posted all over the internet and Google is your best friend. Please utilize these guides to prepare yourself and those around you for the oncoming obstacles. 

**Notes:** You should always know where your healer is. I learned this concept from MOBA games through the superiority of map-awareness and it was refined upon in WoW. In Raids it's common practice to **mark** your healer with an icon

Gather for buffs and charms around a campfire before every boss. You want to go in full-force

Healers should learn to use their technique to gather mana.

Healers should manage their mana. Don't needlessly heal a target that does not need healing. Don't be that healer which uses a healing spell because someone took 1/20th of damage. 

Healers should practice what's known as ""Preventive Healing"". It's a concept in which the healer uses HOT's (Heals Over Time) to prevent too much damage on their raid members. Mystics have HOT's imbued in their target heals. Priests have AoE Ground Heals and Regeneration Circle on a fairly long cool down for Preventive Healing. 


Mystics should make note to remind players in their party or raid to use their orbs when necessary as a safety precaution. I hate when party members don't pick up orbs from Mystics. They can be life savers.

Priests should use Kaia's Shield in emergency situations. It's a life saver. It will prevent a lot of wipes. It's an absorption shield on a fairly long cool down. Scarcely and wisely are the operative words here. 

The use of steroids is encouraged (but not IRL). The word steroid in video games defines a move that temporarily alters attack speed and/or damage for a short period of time. Priests have one. It's called Energy Stars: This is a lock-on skill and is the only priest skill that can be used while moving. If the monster has received damage from the skill

With all this said


Thank you for reading and see you on Tera.

Edit: 

**This is for advice given by other players**

**OrangesAreApples:** Be responsive. I cannot stand it when someone don't reply to questions or answers questions. It's tough. Especially when I say I am new

**Deylar419:** If you're DPS, let the Tank pull. I don't know how many times I've lost a party member or two because I'm kiting the mobs that I pulled by healing the member who decided he could generate more threat than a tank or healer. The only role that generates more threat than a healer, is a tank. So please, again, do NOT pull the room unless you're a tank who can taunt them off the healer.

Hello redditors

Our fansite, news articles and other player-created content. Our user community and player resources continue to grow, but there are still plenty of topics that need to be covered (and it doesn't only have to be guides), and we need your help!

Top priority topics that still need to be covered include the following:

* Lancer PvE
* PvP guides for basically everything but Zerk/Lancer/Slayer
* Dungeon guides for every instance except ToT/Nexus/SJG

We are now getting over 6, such as having full HTML functionality and formatting to create and maintain great looking guides, high search rankings for your content (all of our current stuff ranks extremely well on search engines!) and the ability to collaborate with others, among many others. Whether for the publicity or if you would just like to lend a helping hand to the site and the community, please let us know in the comments, or [contact us!](http://teratoday.com/contact)

How do I know this?

Aion Online was exactly the same.

Aion was struggling 6 months down the line after being pay to play. Not just financially

At this point, it worked.

Now newcomers to the game are enjoying it

Tera will be exactly the same. Newcomers will play

TL;DR: Don't listen to complainers in the global chat

Expect numerous patches and content updates in the coming months.

Well I guess what happened was 2 people from each guild were having a dispute and wanted to GvG but the one guy was scared. They were calling eachother out for abt 10 min and I was just standing around. Now I'm only a lvl 15/16 and these guys were all like 45 and 48 and stuff. So wayyy higher than me. 
But there was one guy who was talkin to me the whole time. He was very nice to me. I ended up askin him if I could join a guild. And he inved me no questions asked. It was really nice. I've never played an mmo before and I never thought id be asked to join a guild. And this guild is pretty big. I felt really good. So anyway this argument settled and we all went our different ways. 
Later (abt 20 min later) I was killing some big spor guys. And there was someone with infamy around. He was way higher lvl than me. Abt 30 I think. This guy tried to sneak up on me for an easy kill while I was trying to kill this spor and all the sudden he dropped dead. I turn around and there was a guild mate there. He had killed this guy that was abt to kill me. He didn't have too. But he did. And it was really nice of him. Anyway I found out later that the guy who killed the dude tryin to kill me was the guild master.
So I guess my point of this is. I really like the TERA community. Sure there are some dicks. But I think there is a lot of really cool chill people too

So if anyone from my guild reads this. Thanks :-)",self,t5_2s527,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/tbbpb/just_a_story_about_something_that_made_me_happy/

Edit (03/05/12):
Wow

Clearly there are some issues with the post background texture lol. I'm working on changing that at the moment and should hopefully have something much better in place by the end of today.

Metnavman, for example we can't get exact spell rotations down but we can definitely do priority lists for cooldowns. Plus as you mentioned there's quite a few people failing. If those people happen upon our site they can potentially stop sucking. :P As for the things you'd love to see, boss abilities/interrupts will be posted in guides in the PvE section and useful class tips will be in the appropriate class forums. On top of that who knows what EnMasse will do in the future, may as well have the community ready for any serious theorycrafting.

I don't just want TE to be about number crunching, a compendium on all things Tera, etc.

Added additional hair colors to the following races:

* Humans: red, green, blue
* Castanics: red, green (Castanics are never blue.)
* Elins: red
* High Elves: red, blue

Modified the alkahests used in item enchantment. Unique alkahests are used for specific tiers of enchantment.

* +1 to +6: Alkahest (sold by merchants)
* +7 to +9: Refined Alkahest (sold by specialty stores)
* +10 to +12: Masterwork Alkahest (sold by specialty stores)

Other stuff: 

* Removed the inter-server party-matching buff
* Destiny Eggs and Lucky Eggs have been removed as quest rewards. The eggs were the primary source of combat consumables until the alchemy crafting system was complete. Any eggs earned in the Open Beta Test will still be there.
* Gula Skinners in the Hungry Caverns no longer spawn minions because that’s not how they roll.
* Items from Balder’s Temple and the Fane of Kaprima are now visible via smart search.
* Deleted the unnecessary “Subscription Information” menu from the main menu.

Bugs: 

* Fixed a bug where certain surfaces appeared to flash
* Fixed a bug where channels on the Island of Dawn increase infinitely.
* Fixed a bug where guild-versus-guild battles could not be declared on guilds with names longer than 32 characters. Your awkward battle cries will save you no longer.

Thanks for Subbing and making this community grow. two months ago we had a 1/4 of the number of redditors here and maybe 1/16 of the submissions. So we need to make sure every one knows our ground rules. These are outlined on the side bar but it seems not everyone reads them or understands them but no worries we would like to just clear the up a few things.
  
  
We have been enforcing from day one ""Submissions that enable or have the intent to enable piracy and online RMT(Real Money Trading) are not permitted."" this includes buying Ktera accounts and private servers. The fact of the matter is that Hangame requires a Korean Social Security Number which is Identity theft so we are removing any links or instructions how to gain access to this.
  
  
We have also been posting once a Beta Stream thread this is to cut down on ""check out my stream"" threads that would take over the Front page. So keep and eye open for that kind of stuff. ;)
  
  
The other Thing we need to mention is Self Promotion. This is a weird slippery slope we want to see what our members are doing we watch practically all of it. :) But we need people to post orginal content and news content. If you are posting only links to what you do for a tera website and never post anything else we dont like seeing that and feel we will need to take action. If you feel like you may be violating this feel free to ask the mods we will let you know.

It was me (a 25 warrior) a 26 lancer and a 26 zerker. The lancer knew what he was doing... me and the zerker on the other hand had no idea what we were doing. ended up dieing twice each and having to run back while the Lancer tanked the BAM like a BAMF. After the first deaths the zerker said ""We need help"" to which i responded ""no we just need to be quicker."" It struck me... When had id ever said that about an elite mob quest in a traditional MMORPG? Usually if the mob is killing you and you are using all of the abilities you have at your disposal and you can't kill it you need to go searching for more people or just a healer. But in Tera you just need to be able to read mob better and react quicker. We killed the first one and went onto the second one,self,

I can bang out my dailies for three weeks just to be rewarded again and again with randomized jewelry that has stats that my class can't even use. Sure glad I do those dailies.

I can get in a Fane of Kaprima hard mode after work

I lucked out and got the most important glyphs from ToT already, hinging the success of the party on the individual players' ability to solo BAMs, but the entire time spent killing trash while waiting for and after completing your BAM is just tedium.

I can waste six hours of my weekend trying to keep my PvP gear up to date in the completely unenjoyable lagfest that is VoT Nexus events. After a few weekends of trying to do Nexus

There's absolutely no fun to be had in the Nexus, is actually stupider than the Vanilla WoW Gates of Ahn'Qiraj ""war effort"" event which required the server to farm and turn in *literally* 3237000 items to open the new raid content. At least that event indirectly encouraged huge amounts of world PvP by forcing thousands of players to go all over Azeroth to farm materials. It also created great community events like lotteries and rewards systems, paid for by the larger guilds in order to incentivize the non-raiding players to help unlock the new content.

It's even stupider than the other part of that event which pitted the major guilds of each server against eachother in a race to gather 16800 bug carapace in order to open up the quest line to complete the Scepter necessary to open the gates. That actually forced major guild confrontations and tensions

**EME seems to be ignoring these issues altogether. Hopefully we can change their minds
[/EDIT]

EME seems to enjoy removing things for one reason or another.

I'm fine with the removal of Private Shops -- as a Broker/AH system is far superior. I do wish they'd remove fees to make up for it though

But

**The removal of Boxes of Mischief.**
I honestly can't understand EME's reasoning behind this one. The only reason I've seen is that some guy from EME ""personally had a negative winning streak with them""

Perhaps the most useful thing you could do with these, something useful. How many of you have been NPCing crystals that do more damage to minions and such, because nobody in the world would want them? Normally, in the original TERA, you'd throw them at your box of mischief and hope that you get something useful. So, because of that, we have things like Acrimonious/Carving Crystals costing upwards of 200-300 Gold. That's quite a bit for something many DPS players will have to replace every couple deaths. There are not white or Pristine versions of these and some other crystals, not being able to duplicate materials by chance. I never tested personally

Not to mention

**Removal of Eggs.** EME also removed Lucky/Destiny/Fortune eggs from quest rewards/drops. You still have them if you gained them dring OBT, they could have altered the reward list... Another method of making money and obtaining random useful items gone.

**Removal off Craft Skill-Up Quests.** For every CBT

I'm sure there's more I could talk about

**So, but it's another when you remove something because idiots will get frustrated with it.

So, I know. Sorry if any of my information is incorrect, pretty sure it's all solid though. Does anyone else get annoyed with all of these things being gone? Would be sweet if EME took notice on this, though obviously very doubtful.",,False,self,1337895929.0,t3_u2d2p

Just a few words from us Mods. Thanks for Subbing and making this community grow, we would like to just clear up a few things. 
  
It has been brought to our attention that many subscribers are not aware of what ""[Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) is and what it entails; Reddiquette is an informal expression of reddit's community values as written by the community itself. Please abide by it the best you can!"" We encourage you to read this if you are new to reddit and would like to better yourself as a citizen of this great hive mind. We would like to draw your attention to a few point’s in particular.
  
&gt; Please utilize Reddit's upvote and downvote system. The up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be. If you think something contributes to conversation, but only if you really think it will help the original poster improve their point. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion. Downvoting personal opinions just because you disagree with them is not proper Reddiquette.
  
We have been enforcing the following from day one: ""Submissions that enable or have the intent to enable piracy and online RMT(Real Money Trading) are not permitted."" This includes buying Ktera accounts and private servers. The fact of the matter is that Hangame requires a Korean Social Security Number which is Identity theft so we are removing any links or instructions on how to gain access to this. It should also go without saying that we are not going to allow any posts that are selling or trading of accounts. 
  
We also need to mention self promotion
  
Memes, some of you have stated that you would like us to start subreddits for each of these things. We don’t see memes being appropriate or attributing to conversation. Guild recruitment and image posts do not seem to be getting in the way of conversations however, if they get out of hand we may take action. You are free to create your own subreddit for your own guild.
  
Lastly, BUT EME vists our subreddit frequently and it is a in game bannable offence. We don't want to see anyone get banned for this so please keep this in mind.

I would also suggest using scrolls of savagery(created through alchemy I believe) because they make your crits do a huge amount of extra damage I didn't know of at the time.

Whenever available I used the health regeneration buff(x3) from gathering because I wasn't too confident at dodging all the skillshots.

GM The.Mad.Doctor: hmm let me look

itswhysee .: That's the conversation. It seemed strange to me that you don't get a 1 free month for purchasing the game without pre-order

GM The.Mad.Doctor: Ok bought or preordered comes with a free month...we had an email about this lol

itswhysee .: Oh so it was just a miscommunication?

itswhysee .: Okay

* No Savage Power Draught (5 more power)

* With Tank


This is my personal favorite list so feel free to add some exceptional kills if you have some. By exceptional I mean 3man or less with no double DPS setup (sorry but dobuble DPS with healer in MC HM is just like 4man kill

Got one on your team? Too bad. But you might think to yourself

Well no.. I've seen people try, **in order to kick someone you need to be 120 seconds out of combat** (while there is no way of telling how long you have waited, you have to repeatedly try until it works). Indirectly this requires you to leech at least 2 minutes yourself.

After the first step is complete and you finally get to initiate a vote kick you also have to convince and have at least 14/15 in your raid to accept the vote kick within 30 seconds, **if someone is dead during a vote kick he/she can't vote.**

Now here is the hardest part, you'll press enter and this will actually cancel the vote kick**, fun times!

I know some, but i figured this post is a place to start to get people a bit aware of the situation.


This is strictly speaking from my experience i have with battlegrounds on EU servers. I don't know if people experience this in other regions or not

**If you are not yet in Territ**, but there isn't anything we can do about it. =\

**Any interested party** may join a chat channel we're going to try to use to help people that are stuck out of the guild -- type `/chat territ 1986` to join it (if it says ""Channel does not exist"" do `/make territ 1986` but obviously nobody else is in the channel yet). To chat there

We *may* be kicking characters that are still on the Island of Dawn that have not played for several days during this free period -- this is yet to be determined.

**Quick run-down/PSA:**

* The dungeon is only 20 minutes long

* The dungeon consists of wave after wave of *normal* monsters, and traps become available to trigger.

* There is an NPC in the dungeon who will give you a potion. Hold on to it!

* There are 3 rooms. The main room with the crystal you must protect from the monsters and two side rooms where they spawn. The optional bosses will also spawn as time progresses in these rooms. 

* If you enter either side room you will become silenced - this is what the potion is for. *It doesn't last long (2 minutes)* and has a 20 minute cooldown

* You will get scaling rewards the more monsters the party kills and the more optional bosses are cleared.  

**Actual Run-Down/Quick Guide:**

* Talk to the NPC to get your potions. 

* Activate the relic to start the timer. Make sure the team is ready first.

* Protect the crystal in the middle from the waves of trash.

* After a few minutes

* Continue killing the trash. Soon barrels will spawn for you to destroy trash with. They do not injure you or your team. 

* Soon after

* The trash continues. The third boss is an arachnen (SM Boss). Use your final DPS to take him down.

* In the last leg of the dungeon

* ???

* Profit  

So that's it folks. It's actually pretty easy

**What do we get?**

Rewards from this dungeon are Dire and Practicum badges

* A new badge merchant has appeared in the center of Kaiator that will trade 60 Dire badges for one advanced glyph. 

* Another merchant will trade 15 practicum badges for one glyph box that has a chance of producing an advanced glyph.  

It should be noted that my run only killed 2 of the bosses and 250 trash mobs. We recieved 3 Practicum Badges and 1 Dire Badge. This is where you guys come in. Let's start aggregating! Let's find out what other yellows drop (we got a necklace much better than Blooddrop with +3% AS) and what the badge rates are. Also

EDIT: Drops include

* Crystal guard scrolls

* Dire Badge(s)

* Practicum Badges

* Uncommon Cruxes

* Gold jewellery

&gt;I have good news and bad news. We will start with the bad news. (For TLDR skip to bottom. Useless information inc)

&gt;Unfortunately there was a Snorlax who was sitting in the way of me getting to our account management admin panel to attempt to change your name. It was crazy

&gt;So the good news is that I made peace with Cubones mother and the old man

&gt;From there I had to challenge Brock (don't ask me why he was here and not in pewter city) to a battle. My only pokemon, so I figured I would never defeat him and be able to change your public name! Suddenly, a fire breaks out and onyx is weakened by the water! I'm conflicted... I would win on a technicality and harm brocks honor if I defeat him because of a fire, but at the same time... you, a paying customer, deserves your public name changed! 

&gt;But no

&gt;Congratulations!



&gt;TLDR/ What in the hell is all of this : I changed your username to Radant as you requested.

&gt;If you have any further questions or concerns please do not hesitate to message us again!


I got this as a response to a request for a forum name changed and it made me laugh! The ticket was open for 30 minutes max.

Well let me start by saying that I've personaly read lots of posts just like this one in the past but I've always told myself the grass cant be THAT greener on the other side


NOPE


After the resent epic and total fail by Gameforge with the August events I installed NA just to try it out this weekend. Right now I reached Lumbermill @ lvl 11. So what went down so far?

I went to the site I started to DL the client is nothing absolutely nothing like the EU client. Not only it looks 100 times more professional it also allows you to start playing the game withing 10-15 min while dling the rest of the game in the background. Big woop?

So I start making a character and I notice that in the name tab you can type virtually anything you like

I log in with a less subtle name and a msg pops up that I got items to claim from lvl 1. Its a regular starter mount

Then I see ppl selling race/name change vouchers in global for about 8k gold (a mes is worth 250g). REALLY? There arent even **** like that in EU. You gotta pay 20 euro for something like that only your account can use obviously.

So I immediately open the shop and then my eyes go like O.O The shop is freaking HUGE. All sorts of stuff I've never ever seen before. Thousands of stuff.

I decide to check out a few small things before I start playing. There are couple of bugs on EU like unable to unfriend/unblock someone in your friendlist with the button and you gotta type /ublock &lt;name&gt; in chat instead. GES WAT GUSY? Its all working perfectly fine in NA.

Personaly I got a graphix issue. My driver crashes every few hours when I play the game. Dunno why, underclocking, older drivers. It still crashes. Yes only in TERA. I've been playing in NA for 2 hours now. Everything is fine. I'd gotten at least 1 crash till now 100%.

Then I started playing and the 2nd tree drops me an orange lockbox for that popo pet thats currently being sold as a random lootbox in EU shop. R O F L

I'd also like to mention (this is on MT server) that so far I havent seen any retarded players spamming their asses in global channels. (Yes I mean you gank and co. retards

So if you are a passionate player who enjoys TERA as much as I do and you are playing on EU rush to http://tera.enmasse.com/ and start downloading. No reason in the world to spend another second on EU even if you got a VM piece as far as I care. I'm so sorry I've ever spend cash for club/items on Gameforge. You don't deserve a penny. You are running what could be a perfect mmo in the ground for Europe.

this solution has already survived three May updates.

and it does not affect any other aspect of the game.

.

this is especially useful if you have a SSD or fast cpu/mobo

since time from login to character load could take seconds.

these screens are only there to *amuse* you while the game

loads 800mb of GIU animation library files in the background

so a slow machine will still take time

UPDATE:

We will be performing server maintenance to increase server stability and other issues listed below. These are server-side changes meaning there will be no client patching. All PvP servers will be taken down for maintenance on Tuesday, followed by all PvE servers from 1:30 to 2:00 PM Pacific.

Today's maintenance will:

* Increase server stability.
* Adjust the number of channels in certain areas.
* Allow the creation of character names with two periods. For example

The following servers will be unavailable on Tuesday

* Basilisk Crag
* Feral Valley
* Jagged Coast
* Valley of Titans

The following servers will be unavailable on Tuesday

* Arachnaea
* Blightwood
* Celestial Hills
* Dragonfall
* Freeholds
* Frost Reach
* Serpentis Isle

First

The leveling in this game did not feel too bad.  Some people mentioned that there is still quests of kill x or gather y.  I don't think you'll ever really be able to get away from that.  You are either going to be grinding mobs or grinding quests.  Trying to make a ton of quests that are dynamic and interesting would take thousands of man hours that only a company with tons of assets would be able to take advantage of.  But with a group, but it is much slower, so I am glad that grouping up to do stuff actually has merit when questing.  

The instances so far were a lot of fun.  I remember the first time I ran SB and 4/5 of our group members got killed when the rock guy slammed his arm down into the ground.  There haven't been any crazy amazing bosses yet

PVP on the PVP server was actually pretty awesome as well.  I got pked a few times, and just because one group outnumbered the other, it didn't mean victory.  Our smaller group of 8 people managed to beat out a group of 13.  

I'd say the most amazing part of the beta was when we were camping the gate to the entrance of manor for enemy guilds and about 100 No Fun Allowed guild members poured through the gate

The only downside to this is that you can't turn your character without pressing alt, if you're facing the direction you want to go, and run into a tree, you don't have to exit out of all your menus.

Edit for clarity:  This changes absolutely nothing for non-UI mode (battle mode). Every ability/dodge/attack will behave normally.
What this does is that in UI mode, you can press A or D to move around it, then your autorun button, without exiting out of UI mode (and closing all your windows).

1 Does this game have a coherent main story and character story? And by coherent

So I wanted to try Tera after seeing all the awesome looking videos. A little history I have played several years of playing quite a few MMo's World of Warcraft, Star Trek Online, Perfect World, and lastly Ragnarok. So with all of these I felt something was missing mainly the player interaction I have memories of rolling over 1-5 then watching my paladin kill everything it just wan't fun. So setting out on my Journey I made a Slayer in the image of a close friend. 

Slayer
[Sashsa.Blade](http://i.imgur.com/qfg30.jpg)

I was joined by a IRL friend who was a priest both of us new and knew nothing. We finished the Island of Dawn without much difficulty although getting lost on the Ferocious flower felons

Warrior
[Cuddle.This](http://i.imgur.com/mWiuZ.jpg)

I decided that I must experience the various classes and races. So I set out to play all the classes and every Race that I could. warrior and Elin was an interesting choice. My thought was small hitbox and quick movements make for a good evasive class. It was hard for me

Priest
[Sasha.Beauty](http://i.imgur.com/LvAmb.jpg)

I enjoyed myself quite a bit. I enjoyed having to worry about my friends and their health as much as myself. Also the large amount of downtime made me happy. I know that it will slow down drastically as it seems to with all MMO healing classes but for now I enjoyed myself. The final boss was a breeze and I even played longer into this class than the others off the island.  I will be coming back to this character. 

Archer
[Felixis](http://i.imgur.com/KKaa4.jpg)

Sadly this was the fastest I cleared the island however it felt boring and uninviting. Also felt like it took the Real Time action and slowed it down. As soon as I made it to Lumbertown I dropped this toon. Did not feel that connection. But for a lack of talking here is a chicken. 

Sorcerer
[Sasha.Firecracker](http://i.imgur.com/22tzK.jpg)

This was an interesting class

Mystic
[Odepius](http://i.imgur.com/EAXph.jpg)

This was fun and I enjoyed it very much. Having a little tank Guy to get attention while I beat on things was fun. I wish the other classes had this. Made short work of everything but I am afraid that it did too many things and not enough of one thing for it to keep my interest. Wish the early self heal was a real heal and not the globe things. 

Lancer
[DragonBorn.Darknight](http://i.imgur.com/IMfG4.jpg)

Lancer was cool. I liked that I could block everything and take little damage and by the time I got to playing Lancer the Enemies were second nature and I could predict everything. I think I took less than 2k Damage the entire Island. I want this to be my class as I like having  the huge ego and it seems that they are the only class that everyone needs for the group and there are very little of. 

Beserker 
[Myamoto.Musashi](http://i.imgur.com/LAewj.jpg)

Very much felt to me as the same as the lancer just with some added DPS content. I liked it but didn't make a difference from the slayer and not enough quick fire damage to become a better lancer. finished out the Trial with this last night. Very good ending on a great 7 day trial. 


I Loved what I did and I have the full collectors edition Physical copy that I opened last night. I am now playing Sasha.Blade and you can find me on JC. I look forward to applying to Territ and will be active most days. 

Thank you for your time
Sahsa.Blade Slayer of Bears

250-280: This is a grind

280-290: You're going to need to find some patterns here. The patterns themselves drop from Ascent of Saravash at a high rate from the Devans in the beginning and off the first boss. There's no need to go further and it shouldn't be difficult to solo. Another thing to remember is that attunement patterns will level your crafting. Rowan runes are very cheap right now and crafting and attuning items will cut down your titan rune requirement significantly.

290-320: Now you've hit it easy. Standard recipes off the vendor and likely the runes you've been hording in the bank will take care of this.

320-330: Another rough patch. You'll need to find another recipe. This time they drop out of Saleron's Sky Garden. The prions directly after the first boss will drop them and they respawn. This will be difficult solo and I've only done it as a warrior so beware.

To my knowledge the rest of the patterns you will need are plentiful on the broker and you should all know how to get a hold of tier 5 runes at this point.

1327765382.0,p0ji0,IAmAn experienced MMO veteran playing the Korean version of Tera Online. AMAA,ChivalryNinja,30,9,64,"Prepare yourself for a hearty read. I have a lot of good to say about this game.

**A little background information about me:**

I'm a college student studying Computer Science with a focus in programming. As such, I'm in a guild of 250 Americans, some of which know Korean, and there are multiple English guides online for the game.

I'm an 8-year Star Wars Galaxies veteran that achieved the rank of Jedi Knight in the FRS. For those of you that have no knowledge of that game during its early time, a lot of Age of Conan(or Age of Fail), and, until recently, was playing SW:TOR. I have a 50 PvP Champion on Bondar Crystal. Believe me, there's a reason why I'm playing Tera over Bioware's [TORtanic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o08e_xlXAVc), but I'll address that in another thread. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Additionally, with 30-60 fps. My fps drops to 20 when I record live game footage with Bandicam, but I assume it's because my video card is bottle-necking my system. 

Computer Specs: 

* AMD FX-4150 Quad Core processor @ 3.6GHz
* nVidia GTX 275 - upgrading soon
* Corsair 4GB DDR3 1333MHz - upgrading soon
* Intel 320 series 120GB SSD
* 1 TB HD @ 7.2k RPM for fraps and other storage


**About the game:**

Quests and PvE are relatively simple

Combat is as complex as it is immersive. Critical hits from my swords fly on the screen in red explosive text

The graphics are as good as Skyrim's Ultra setting

Class balance is a primary concern and focus of the development team. Every class is viable in both PvP and PvE. 

Character creation was in depth and complex

The game's ""glyphing"" system, be it by decreasing mana cost, increasing damage, decreasing cast time, decreasing cooldown, and more. For example, my main strike that builds up mana builds 30% more per hit because I purchased a glyph and put points into it. Talent trees are non-existent

**Why Tera Online will most likely succeed in its North American release:**

* The game is fun. I mean really fun. The action MMO genre has been a joke up until now. I've played an Archer up to level 15 and my Warrior is level 27. Detail on these classes and more can be found [here](http://www.tera-online.com/content/classes) 
 
* The FPS system is fan-fucking-tastic. No longer will you have to tab target and spam buttons. It's all open-ended. Melee feels like a hack-and-slash and ranged combat requires the utmost care and dexterity. You will not get bored playing this game. While it is an FPS system

* The game itself is entirely a sandbox. Worlds are open and full of life. While different quests will take you to different zones of the game

* The AI is as challenging as it is diverse. 

* Crafting is complex, it is displayed across every players screen in plain view, accompanied by a rewarding trumpet sound.

* Guilds may take over and control almost any zone of the game

* Anyone can go to war with anyone. Was one of your guild members insulted by an individual of another guild? Or maybe you just don't like the other person's goofy face. Whatever the reason

* The game has a collision system amongst NPC's and characters

* Class roles are more important than ever with the FPS system. For example: Heavy tanks can stand at the front line and hold up their shields via a block system

*  The Korean version of the game has been released since January of last year. As such

* The game revolves around end-game guild vs. guild PvP. While there are raids and dungeons that can be completed for loot

* Tired of Alliance vs. Horde or good guys vs. bad guys? Yeah

* Server load cap is insanely huge for Tera. IIRC it is well over 50


**I'll add more information as it comes to mind. Feel free to ask me almost any. Obviously I won't be able to answer much about the crafting system.

*Edit 1: Added information about the glyphing system.

**Edit 2: Added information about server population caps",self,t5_2s527,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/comments/p0ji0/iaman_experienced_mmo_veteran_playing_the_korean/

""Quote: Runespider on 05/23/2013

    Maybe you aren't supposed to be able to get this mount?

    Newsflash

I'm coming to that conclusion as well. The question I've been asking myself is this

Yes, 300 boxes but no one else is. You're taking them all and actually that's fine because even with hundreds of boxes you're still in the low percentage rates to actually get the mount.

So why create such an event, and R's but no A's?

When I first read Runespider's post I thought hmmm - conspiracy theory! Time to put on my tinfoil hat! But after listening to global chat this morning I realized that perhaps there's some truth there. I can only think that the event is NOT designed for you to get the mount.

It's designed to make you WANT the mount. And when you don't get it in the skewed event then you'll buy it in the store.

The more you search for boxes the higher your investment in having the mount rises. The more you open boxes and find a useless firework the higher your investment in having the mount rises. The more frustrated you are the more likely you are to go into the ""well it's ok I can just buy it when it shows up in the store"" category. Which is now popping up over and over in Global.

I feel like such a noob for running around looking for the boxes. If I run across one fine

Like piles of them. So when I heard about this SUPER FUN event being put on for new players to come join us in Tera I figured... why not do something awesome?

So here are the rules

First you need to make a FRESH LvL 1 after the start time of the event. That means that some of you will be logging into Tera at 3AM EST (like myself). 

Here is that information: http://tera.enmasse.com/news/posts/power-level-for-prizes?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;amp;utm_content=031113-no-sleep-event-update-link_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news

My Event runs from 12:01 a.m. PDT

You will need to take a screen shot of your account before you make your new leveling character like so:
http://imgur.com/uZfU22i

Then after creation another screen shot to help verify some more:
http://imgur.com/9dYwzjv

Once you get into the game
http://imgur.com/3ZjnfQO

Then get to leveling silly! Every 10 levels make sure to stop for a moment, take that screenshot and post it here (all in one post per person please)
http://imgur.com/90BFOrP

Everyone who participates in this event by leveling from 1 to 60 before the event ends will be entered into a drawing for at least 1 Founders Code

The amount of Founders Codes will be proportional to the number of entries! So make sure to tell your friends!

If you are interested in joining others on your server who are participating in this event please make sure to stop by the stream twitch.tv/realblankspace and ask in chat who has a guild that is accepting members for this event!

&gt;Briefly weaken the endurance of your foes by 3%. Effect stacks up to three times.

It's on a 3.5s cooldown and the effect lasts for 12s.

When I first saw Debilitate, so I thought maybe the 9% Endurance decrease on your target wasn't worth it.

I just ran some tests, it's the *difference* between them that is worth noting.  *(DB = Debilitate)*

                 No DB, Crit   3x DB, Crit
    AA (3rd Hit)	   700	             1
    Heart Thrust	   7,000	        35,000
    Knockdown Strike                                     20


As you can see

If you consider 3 DPS attacking a boss for 5 minutes,000 damage.  These numbers will be much larger at max level with proper Glyphs/Crystals on your DPS.

tl;dr

* Debilitate should be kept at 3 stacks 100% of the time during boss fights.
* Glyph of Impulsion gives a 35% chance to eliminate it's MP cost.
* Glyph of Lingering increase the duration of the debuff by 100%.
* **Glyph of Lingering** is an absolute must use.  It's very possible to keep the debuff up without it

*Please keep in mind these concepts are from a min/maxer point of view.  If you don't share that mindset

Just posting this here so I can ask you guys to proof-read / edit if I overlooked something. 

Also if somebody knows how to format stuff better that would be great. Not sure if the sections should be ordered in importance or something...

Feel free to add more stuff to it so long as 

1. It is relevant to very low levels. So I'm talking lv1~15.

2. Keep the answers brief. 

3. It isn't big enough to be a page on its own and doesn't fit in the other pages. There is some overlap with the leveling tips page.

There are some shit people in this subreddit
God save me from some aspects of the MMO community. You people are impossible. You have ruined a ton of AAA games in the last few years - you DEMAND treadmill gated endgame, and you all bitch and whine because you can't grind yourself to boredom in a month like you have done with every other MMO.
You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself
You all keep acting like this, because they will simply not be profitable.
Maybe the problem isn't the MMO
Many of you will spend hours exploring the world in Skryim
Why can't we as an MMO community take the attitude we bring to FPS games
We take the attitude of playing games for FUN in almost every other genre

Lancer:
You shouldnt really even consider yourself a tank until level 18. Challenging Shout is your primary threat generator. It's significant

Glyph Mana Return to your combo attack right away. Dont glyph threat to your combo attack

Get +threat on weapon crystal

Warrior:
Use Torrent of Blows every C/D. Use Smoke Aggressor every C/D  on bosses or duing mass little mob pulls (make sure you have the health available). Dont use Battle Cry every C/D, careful usage is key. Raising Fury is decent threat and 20% less damage. Threat is much easier to hold on a warrior.

Good movement is key as a warrior. You can dodge left and right instead of through the monster, get used to figuring out how to drop it off correctly.

Be very careful with Rain of Blows. It commits you to an action for a very long time with no damage reduction.

Warrior tanking gets easier at 26. Plan to Glyph Death from Above for c/d straight away.

* To claim items from special editions or other rewards: Hit escape

* You can add crystals to your weapon to enhance damage, and other bonuses.  Crystal merchants will sell cheap crystals, specialty merchants will sell more expensive ones with better benefits.

* Tera works great with a controller.  I use a PS3 controller (With MotionJoy) and enjoy it greatly.  L2

* If you have a physical copy of the game you can enter the code on the site backwards to get some scrolls

* Fall damage can't kill you

* You can hold the pickup button to pickup multiple items without having to spam it.

* Teleport Masters are great

* If you pass on instantly teleporting to the instance when using the LFG tool ~~you won't be able to get that option again~~.  You will have to 1) run to the instance, you can click on the Dungeon Finder button below the minimap to teleport to the dungeon.""

* You can use armor/weapons you don't need in four ways.  Vendoring, and Enchanting Fodder.  Vendoring is likely the least helpful since there is always a need for enchanting fodder being sold on Auction and you'll get more for it.

* You can quickly change channels by clicking the Ch. # in the top right corner and select the one you want.  This is great when questing and the place you want is too crowded and you can't get anything done.

- Pre-Order Digital Collectors from you guys
- Level a 22 on Head Start (open Beta Weekend)
- Cancel Pre-Order because I Pre-Order at a local store for the box version because I really love this game
- Head Start weekend could not get onto my server period and told me to play another server.
- Few days later when there was no Queue on my server I found out my 22 was deleted.
- Went to pick up my pre-order and find out the idiot local shop sold out... Forgot to keep enough for pre-orders.
- Bought Collectors from here again.
- Played but got DCed every 5-10 minutes really odd the game seems to derp my router out for some odd reason not your fault I think.
- All my pre-order bonuses are gone
- Woke up logged in and account expired due to this sub bug now..


Now if this was World of Warcraft or almost 95% of the other companies on the internet I would have done a chargeback and raged so hard.

But from what I seen and how helpful they been so far to the players in a whole I feel that my issue will get resolved. I will never be able to turn the clock back and I'm not going be able to catch up and nor will I be the first at anything now. But because the way they have treated me and many others I just feel like I'm part of something special and unique. I have never experienced this kind of service on the internet for about 10 years now.

My aim is the exact same as theirs. I have actively been on this subreddit for quite some time now and want to see the TERA community as well as this subreddit grow. 

**General information**

With the recent F2P announcement
We can help you find party members to run dungeons
To join Territ, type in 'Territ' and click Search. Finally, click on 'Apply to Guild' and either myself or a moderator will accept you :)
We'll take anyone at any level, ""Don't be a dick!"" If you think you can handle that, we'd love to have you! I, personally, have been around since head start and although I don't have a max level character on the PvE server, I do study the game and will try my hardest to help whoever is in need. We have a **Ventrillo** server at **TX2.LeetVent.com:3806** that any current or prospective member is welcome to use. There is currently no password on the server and this will remain the case as long as the server isn't abused. Be advised, it is only a 75 person server atm as this is all I can afford. If in the future it is not enough room and someone is willing to help with funds I'd be all for increasing the capacity.

**Guild Bank:** If you see something you would like in the guild bank

I know we are not full yet

Main characters will be accepted over alt characters if application messages specify such.

Now, because if it lives up to BHE/EME's promises and how fun the gameplay videos I've watched look, it is literally everything I'm looking for in an MMO. 

That said

I'm of the opinion that En Masse needs to kick their marketing into high gear right now to generate enough good hype for release. Correct me if I'm wrong, let alone those with quiet overseas launches, don't have a history of faring well. I've tried to show TERA to my SWTOR guild, and I've noticed that when the word ""Korean"" precedes ""MMO,"" it becomes a dirty word. Everyone just immediately shuts down and dismisses the game as a standard grindfest, and many Korean games are. (Aion, anyone? Ugh.)

1373665019.0,1i6jex,Malcolm.Reynolds' Corsairs' Stronghold Strategy/Leader Guide,coxmystroke,25,5,22,"**Malcolm Reynolds' Strategy Guide to Corsair's Stronghold**

I'm going to split this into offense and defense sections, this strategy is rather conservative, but has proven effective so far - even if more aggressive tactics  (i.e. Zerging a ladder) do result in faster wins on the occasion that they work.

**Offense**

***Opening maneuvers: 15:00 to ~12:30***

* 4 DPS and 1 healer (usually me) in south airship, simply hit the crystal (Anchorstone) until they clear you out or you win.

* 1 person, joining the main force once killed.

* The other 14 should hit South gate like a fucking freight train

* Tanks shoot at cannons/mid pyre to suppress enemy sieges and keep some heat off the airships and attacking team.

* Once the south gate's HP is low

***Assault on Central Pyre (Mid): ~12:30 to ~11:00***

* Once the south gate is down

* 2 tanks roll up to mid to support the push and one moves into courtyard.

* It is very rare that a defending team is equipped and positioned to handle a 20-man armored assault

* The rest of this time is spent clearing out and stragglers and moving all tanks to the inner gate.

***Assault on Inner Gate/Anchorstone: ~11:00 to ~08:30***

* Once mid is secured and artillery is positioned in the courtyard

* Meanwhile

* Once the inner gate falls

* Tanks bombard crystal/defenders in the room though the door.

* Keep pressure up until the round ends.


**Defense**

You may have noticed that I made no mention of scanning in the offense section, the leader should be scanning *as often as possible* and directing auxiliary troops to hotspots.  Doing so will preserve you defensive assets (gates and cannons) for longer, which is very helpful in assuring a win.

Note that I will not be including times here

***Opening seconds/Initial Positioning***

As you may have noticed from my explanation above, there is another objective which, IMO, is more important, and that is adequately defending the inner ladders.  Strategy to follow:

* 4 Ranged DPS on the inner wall
* One zerk in inner wall for backup if a moderate push is made on either inner ladder.

*I always call for these players by name before the round begins

* One healer should stay inner as well. I always fill this role in my BG's

* One *competent* person takes the tank on inner and helps shoot down the airships; the 4 outer defenders (explained later) stay on inner to repel an airdrop should the sieges miss.

Note that the inner defenders (aside from the auxiliary team, but an absolutely critical one in this strategy.

* 10 men move to mid ASAP and hold it

* The remaining 4 defenders take positions on the outer ladders and provide auxiliary support for mid if needed.  Note that these players should stay on the inner wall until the airships have been successfully destroyed or the airdrop repelled.

* In the event that an outer gate is destroyed

* If mid pyre is successfully controlled for the entire round

***Turtle Mode (AKA “Oh-shit-halp-we-losing-wat-do Defense Mode”)***

In the event that mid pyre is lost

* One additional DPS moves to each inner ladder-top, one zerk, and the tank on inner wall.

* The other 11 or so people spawn on inner and harass the infantry trying to break down the gate by either jumping off the wall and fighting in courtyard or shooting through the gate with AoE's.

* Once the Inner Gate falls to 40% HP

* The tank moves downstairs to physically block the door way should the gate fall.

* I will generally head downstairs as well at this point

Usually

The attackers' first rush can be repelled with usually only minor damage to the crystal, you've got your work cut out for you, but it is doable assuming the enemy is brought down quickly upon reaching the crystal.

In general

**Additional Notes/General Tips/Et Cetera**

* This guide was written assuming that you are spawning attack side first.  If you intend to implement this strategy on a defensive initial spawn, which in my case it most often does.

* Co-operation is absolutely key in CS; kills have no direct bearing on wins/losses

* Communicating with your teammates goes hand-in-hand with cooperating

* In the event that you intend to lead a CS run, and respond much more positively to being asked or politely ordered to do something than to being treated like an idiot.  I have quite a bit of personal experience with communicating in the manner as a coxswain on my University rowing team, and for a number of years prior; the same principles that apply to my rowers work just fine leading a raid or BG in Tera.

* Personally, 2 and 3 please report to the north inner ladder ASAP.”  If this command is ignored, I drop  the polite act and say something along the lines of “3DPS to north inner IMMEDIATELY! We're vulnerable there!”  If this is ignored, chances are you've got a team of assholes, and can begin cursing out people until they fall in line, although always try to present a mature and collected persona along with demonstrating your anger.

Apologies in advance to anyone that has a scroll monopoly on their servers. :S


One of the best ways I've found to make scrolls is by extracting t 11/12/13 gear for metal ingots! This is a painless way to get rid of those drops that most people pass on in dungeons and make them into something super useful!


Step 1: Level alchemy to 250. Go to a crafting board and pick up the alchemy quest. Do the quests to level up alchemy. It should take about 20 minutes or less and less than 200g! Learn the scroll recipes you want when you hit 250.


Step 2: Level your metal extraction. Go to a general goods merchant and buy the METAL extraction recipes. Start with metal extraction tier 1 and work your way to 13. You don't need to extract anything to level it up


Step 3: Acquire/Extract your t11/12/13 gear. This gear drops in virtually any end game dungeon and nexus. While some pieces of gear may sell well as templates on the broker


In terms of what gives the most xersteel ingots, white boots might give you 2 xersteel ingots. Occasionally, extraction will fail and you'll get nothing.

Step 4: Craft your scrolls! Note: If you want scroll of dash


I usually get most of my t11/12/13 fodder from duoing KN/ET/LoT while farming mes/mwa. Lots of people also tend to pass on it in Nexus cuz they're scared of wasting a good roll on these tiers as well!

I'm having an unexplained issue with the game that Mods

Alright. So this is not your ordinary problem. My computer has some pretty good specs

The problem isn't any kind of frame lag, my shit will just freeze. I can run around but I can't use skills, get on mount, jump, etc. After a few days of crying about it with my boyfriend, I decided I would not give up. I contacted a few of the GMs through livechat; GM Chad- who told me I had no problems, and GM Cahir- who told me I was dropping packets and needed a hard modem reset from my ISP (Time Warner).

Now, after the hard Modem reset obviously did not work, I traded in my old modem for a brand new one, and doubled my speed to 20/2, hopefully figuring this would eliminate the problem (I'm not specifically tech savvy, don't kill me, it was free.)

This did not solve the problem. I did what GM Cahir asked and it did not work. Out of frustration

I found out that somehow youtube is fixing the problem I'm having. However, but if it's not open, Tera will refuse to work.

Sorry for the wall of text, do any of you have any idea just what the FUCK is happening to my game? Why is youtube fixing the problem? What the hell is wrong with my computer (I guess that's the only thing left the blame?) Let me stress that this is NOT in any way fps lag. It's pure d/c, as in, I can see standing animations, but everything just stops moving. 

tl;dr: stupid person can't figure out why youtube is fixing a disconnect problem. help!

I'll post my comp specs later

FUN NOTE: if i don't have youtube open, the drop back off again. (until I press o again, LOL.)

UPDATE: Specs:

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 8 Logical Processor(s)

Installed Physical Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB

AMD Radeon HD 6700 Series (1GB)

anything else I should put here?

Small Update: If the problem can't be solved

I am referring to something you must know for days by now: You are currently not competitive with the version hosted by EnMasse at all. You have finally got the exact same content patch out (we used to lack chronoscrolls at the very least), I assume you do like selling things, yes? And a second problem I will adress, the interaction with the community is really poor at times.

Following are some things I believe would improve your game drastically, and the german and french localization, are currently the only reasons you have any players at all, and why people are still around. This is obviously not a good thing. **Please at least try to be competitive with the version hosted by EME, that is supposed to co-exist!**

**This is going to be a long LOOOOOONG post, but here is the full version for those patient enough to read through all of it:**

**ISSUE 1:**

NA/EnMasse cash shop has MUCH more items in it. Probably about 10 times as much, right? Why did you guys only implement, or receive, this small an amount of items? Or is EnMasse itself making all those items, and not Bluehole? Unless EnMasse itself has a dev-team working on it, and you guys only receive a small selection from Bluehole (which would definitely suck for you guys), there is no reason you shouldn't put those things in. The age-rating thing can hardly be related to that, as for as far as I know you guys are the ones that are making the language-based adaptations for the content

What to do? Add more items to the Cash Shop. Gameforge CM Raven posted ""we'll continuously add more"", we don't need individual (/ small sets of) items being added in over time, we need a MASSIVE increase in the amount of items, otherwise people will simply leave to the other version of Tera if they wish to have more choice, and if they do not mind the lag of course. And even if you're going to be adding those items in we are behind: Please stop releasing a major patch when not everything is done, as it creates a negative feeling in your playerbase. You could've even just announced the release date of this F2P patch to be a week or 2 later, if you didn't have stuff done, and there was nothing wrong with that.


**ISSUE 2:** (I wanted to make this 3

The communication between the Gameforge team and the playerbase (I refuse to call it a community due to the definition of the word, read ""the community"" instead.), is just not too great.

First of all, unless we bookmark the profiles of all your employees and look at their recent posts. A tool looking up all the recent posts, or even making newsposts with your statements (much) more often, would fix some of this. However, most third-party websites that tracked official responses, are no longer functional, and you do not have a big fansite like for example Blizzard has in MMO-Champion

The other thing is 2 parts that influence eachother: A: The responses from official employees tend to always be very short and/or vague

I have to admit, as mentioned before. Communication between Gameforge and the playerbase just seems to be very difficult.

Now on the other side, and they even take to Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/TeraOnline/) to clarify things here and there. Why Reddit? Because the constructive and most-agreed-upon criticism or comments are visible on top, and the trollish/flaming ones on bottom, or not at all, and this gives for a great place to have self-moderated discussion. Obviously, they take it a bit far, and I'm not saying you should start answering questions on Reddit that in reality should have be sent to customer support, or make singular replies on Reddit to matters that seem to bother the playerbase a lot.

I think this will make the playerbase a lot happier, but if they are poorly moderated, or do not get useful developer/producer conversation, they could just as well be the forums of a mediocre fansite. (and yes there will always be some vocal whiny or trollish people on forums.)

Support says ""i dont know but i know if you access it from over there it will ban you.""*

A friend told me about Tera today and it looks pretty awesome so I figured I'd check it out.  I tried to buy it from En Masse

I can be patient while they get their store back online so I figured I'd check out the demo instead.  The ""Instant Demo"" link on the site fails telling me I don't meet the bandwidth requirements to play.  That's weird since I'm on 200M fiber and it's not uncommon for me to see download speeds of 15MB/s or higher.  Since that didn't work, and then got an error saying ""Your account is not allowed to make purchases at this time."".  Huh?  I tried to create a public name so I could join the forums and I got ""This account cannot be updated at this time"".  WTF?  Got in touch with support via their live chat (finally something worked!) and this is how it went:

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** Hi

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Hi!  I just created an account so I could download the Tera trial

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** let me check it out

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** I get ""This account cannot be updated at this time""

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** where are you?

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** I am in Japan

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** I'm an American though...I can't speak Japanese.  I am a DoD contractor here

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** you might need to try the Europe tera. you have been banned for accessing from over there

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Banned?  Why?  I just heard about the game today and just now created an account...

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** well just a sec

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** That means all the US military stationed here would be banned too?  Wow...

&gt;&gt;You can play TERA on En Masse servers from North America

&gt;&gt;En Masse has a license to operate TERA game servers in North America. This means that if you are in North America, and Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia) you can play on En Masse Servers.



&gt;&gt;TERA is being published by En Masse in North America and by Frogster in Europe.

&gt;&gt;You don’t need to be located in North America to play on North American servers but you do need to purchase TERA through its North American publisher



&gt;&gt;To play on European servers

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Yep, and register it to your En Masse account""

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** yeah but you live in japan

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** It says ""You don’t need to be located in North America to play on North American servers ""

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** I mean, but I could wait)

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** i dont know but i know if you access it from over there it will ban you. you need the tera-europe.com

&gt;**No Nickname Set:** Yeah

&gt;**GM Cindlebell:** cool. :) have a great day!

I'm used to having issues with paying for things online due to being located in Japan with a US billing address on my card and I'm used to having to jump through hoops for my PSN and XBL accounts due to them not supporting the ""AP"" state (it's a state designation for overseas military.
