This is all possible through a public dropbox. A system that allows you to share files between desktops and mobile phones. I use it at work so why not use it for fun too??

If you already have dropbox

Let's make this one of the greatest cookbooks anyone can find!

EDIT: Here is the link to the dropbox. I'm about to add a recipe myself so it's pretty bare :( But please

Also, a little notification pops up! Which I think is pretty cool..


EDIT2: There is a discussion going on between using scoop and level measurements (i.e. 1 cup) and using a food scale. What would you all prefer? Also a conversion chart has been added to the dropbox.

When adding diced potatoes to a soup or stew

1) Don't bother washing or peeling the potatoes

2) Dice the potatoes up and put into a large bowl -- not your pot!

3) Fill the bowl with cold water

4) Let soak for only a few minutes

5) Fill up and rinse your potatoes one more time.  

6) Drain all water as best you can.

7) NOW add the potatoes to the soup

8) Cook the soup for an additional 25-35 minutes and the potatoes should be done.


The result is that your soup isn't starchy or cloudy or grainy

Don't add the potatoes in too soon -- if you're really cooking your soup a long time to let the flavors come together

1367866040.0,1dt3gt,super old-school Bolognese recipe,PincheIdiota,835,149,119,"Hey r/cooking.  I posted this as a comment

I poached this recipe from a crazy old Milanese chef who worked as a consultant opening an Italian restaurant back in 2003ish. (I was a line cook then-executive chef now). His bolognese and gnocchi recipes are the two best things I've ever committed to memory. This recipe is a pain in the ass

I make this in a big square braising pan in a restaurant kitchen

Pull the leaves off about 2 linear feet of fresh rosemary (1oz ish whole) Sauté those for 30 seconds with ten bay leaves in about a cup of medium hot olive oil.

Add 8# yellow onion, just process them until they're tiny in a food processor - when all's said and done, they basically vanish into the sauce. Cook em until they sweat over heat that is high enough to hear, but don't let them brown or burn. If you keep them moving with a wooden spoon it works well.

Next add: 10# ground beef

Puree 1# chicken livers and small dice (or food process) 1.5# mortadella (baloney works too on the cheap). Add them to the meat and cook over high heat (scraping the bottom constantly with your flat-edged wooden spoon) until the liver liquid coating the meat takes on a rusty orange color - 2-5 minutes probably.

Now add 2# tomato paste. You want this to cook until it turns rusty orange too. Keep scraping with your spoon so nothing burns on the bottom of the pan.

The next step can be done a few different ways. Mario used to add about about 3/4# beef base and a gallon or so of water. This is the one point in this recipe that i've accomplished in many different ways. The purpose of this is to add salt, boullion cubes and water. The ABSOLUTE FUCKING BEST WAY is to throw about 3# veal demi-glace in with a few quarts of water or stock. You can buy demi frozen at butcher shops, restaurant supply shops, and some nice grocery stores. It gives the sauce phenomenal depth and mouthfeel.

This is also the time to add three or four bottles of big red wine.

The sauce will look like a watery meat soup now. Turn the heat down to low and let it simmer and reduce. Hit the bottom of the pan like a zamboni with your wooden spoon every now and then to make sure no hot-spots are sabotaging your sauce-fetus as it develops. It'll take a few hours

It is ready to go once the liquid has reduced to the point that it looks like tight sloppy joe mix. Or meat coated with ketchup. A good way to know for sure - lift some out of the pot on your wooden spoon. It should be tight enough that you get a mound of meat on the spoon standing half as tall as the spoon is wide.

You there? Great. Throw a pound of unsalted butter into the sauce to celebrate. Mix it around until it melts

A lot of Bolo recipes include canned tomatoes and milk. This one is super old-school Emilia-Romagna and keeps the dairy and tomato components separate until you finish the dish.

To finish:  In a large pot, 3oz tomato sauce, and 2oz veloute per person. Also throw in a tablespoon of whole butter. While it's getting hot, drop your pasta (something with grip: pappardelle, tagliatelle, fettucine, rigatoni, salted (1 T salt : 1 gallon) water

Pull the pasta out of the water and drop it into the sauce. Add a little of the water from the pasta to the pan if it looks too dry. Let that all cook together for about a minute over medium heat. The sauce should permeate the noodles and cling to them. You're almost there. Throw a big pinch (golf ball sized?) of grated parmesan (or similar cheese) in and toss it around. TASTE IT - add salt and/or cheese as necessary.

Plate that in a big pasta bowl by spinning tongs in your noodle pan until you have a softball sized clump of food-material attached, black pepper, and drizz a couple teaspoons of olive oil over the top.  Boom.

That's because you're blind now

Thanks for all the comments!  I'll put together a scaled down version in the next couple days and get to work on the gnocchi.",,t5_2qh7f,1367887393.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1dt3gt/super_oldschool_bolognese_recipe/

Anyway

-----
So my girlfriend and I went an a diet a few weeks ago, proud (fat) Italian American and wasn't about to sacrifice having good dinners.

So, taste buds, and most importantly girlfriend happy.

What to buy:

* Chicken breast

* Onions
* Broccoli

* Red/green/orange peppers

*  Mushrooms

*  Asparagus

* Carrots

*  Cabbage

* Tomato

Spices/seasonings:

Wet:

* Red/White Wine
*  Balsamic Vinegar
*  Worcestershire sauce
* Soy sauce

Dry:

* Garlic Powder (or garlic salt)
* Onion Powder
*  Cumin
* Garam Masala
* Beau Monde
* Kosher salt
*  Chili Powder
* Italian seasoning (some mixture of oregano, etc)
*  Cilantro

OK, pick about 3 veggies, 2 wet spices, and 3 dry spices.

Cut chicken into cubes.

In a pan over medium-high to high heat, peppers, or carrots. All of these should be diced.

Saute for a few minutes. Onions should start to turn clear

Add your other liquid at this point. (1/8 cup)

Throw in the rest of your veggies, but it will work well enough without a lid. ) If it starts looking a bit dry, add 1/8 cup water.

Dinner is ready when your kitchen smells awesome. (10-20 mins)

Examples: Mexican- Peppers, garlic powder, chili powder, and about 1tbsp Worcestershire and balsamic vinegar.

Indian- Onion, garam masala, garlic powder, italian seasoning, red wine, and balsamic vinegar.

Nondescript Asian- Broccoli, onion powder, garlic powder, rice wine vinegar (or white wine), soy sauce

Italian- Onion, mushroom, garlic powder (or go for fresh for this one), Italian seasoning, red wine, and a bit of balsamic. Add the tomatoes in early on this one (with the onions).

American(?)- broccoli, onion powder, garlic powder, white wine, 1-2tbps Worcestershire

In general- Pick something green, add liquids you think would go well (they all will probably), and any of the seasonings really haha. All of this will go well together.

You can, also, this is a 1 pan meal. 

Feel free to PM me with questions too

Hope this helps some of you out!

But as no one had a definitive answer, I decided to send the question to two pasta manufacturers: Barilla and Dececco.  Dececco never answered (perhaps because my Italian isn't that great), but here's the answer from Barilla:

&gt; Salt is always used in preparing pasta in Italy. A touch of salt in the water brings out the flavor of the pasta. Sea salt is recommend since it is a natural product that enhances the flavor without creating salty-tasting pasta. However

**EDIT:** [Qasph points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/122f29/if_pasta_tastes_better_when_you_add_salt_to_the/c6rqqgn) that, no other ingredients. Of course, this makes me want to ask a whole new set of questions...

1356795777.0,15mkpm,Why a high-end knife is probably not for you,DTNKnives,783,211,319,"First off, I don't think most people are prepared for what's actually required to use an expensive knife.

I'll use the cliche analogy of the car around a track. The average car, and get you around (usually). If you are a *nut* and like to do it in extreme fashion, then perhaps a race car is in order. You can't just drive a race car and expect it to maintain itself - there's a buttload of maintenance and babying. The ""normal"" car, however, requires minimal maintenance in comparison. Same deal with knives.

**An expensive knife is made to tailor to very specific details that are negligible to most people.** I can imagine that most of us don't care if the balance of a knife is 1 cm in front of the bolster or 1.5 cm. We probably don't care that a knife cuts *too* well, but takes 160% more effort/time to get there.

Yes

**An expensive knife will only cut as well as it was intended if it's babied.** This doesn't mean honing it with a rod whenever it's starting to cut less than ideal. It can include getting a high-end cutting board, wiping/drying after every cutting session, storing it correctly, stropping/touching up regularly, and properly sharpening when the edge needs to get freshened up. In case you're wondering, the point of a good knife isn't to hold a factory edge forever, but to hold a balance of ease of sharpening and edge stability - it's *meant* to be sharpened and even thinned when the time comes.

Honing with a rod can only get the edge so far. This approach is only for quick, really hard. There generally is no realigning, hence stropping on a stone or loaded strop is what's most commonly used to touch up an edge. A good ceramic rod can be used for a quick refresh, but the limitations have to be understood.

Going back to the hardness of the knife, like I said above, no unnecessary contact - with sinks, forks, spoons, bowls, plates, soup cans, etc. Cut only things that were meant to be cut. Use a different knife for bone and lobster crushing.

-
To summarize, or at the very least be able to strop it (and then send it to someone who *can* sharpen it). A good ceramic rod is an OK alternative, but with limitations.

This reduces SO much cooking time. I feel I can throw together any number of my favorite dishes with no effort

One time, they called us “top notch”. The present governor of California came on a weekly basis and may other folks. Our setting was intimate. Our cuisine was magnificent. The product we served was hand picked at three in the morning. We snatched the goods from big restaurant names because their chefs were too lazy to do the trip to the early morning markets. Mexicans filet makers loved us. Fresh vegetables kept their best in their backrooms for us. We ruled LA for three years and sold the darn joint in time before the economic collapse. Because I love reddit

Spaghetti alla Bolognese

The secret of all good French and Italian sauce – and why you guys get heart burns all the time in the US – is a good stock. In the US

Veal stock:

Get three big bones of veal. I don't care how you find the darn thing. Kill it yourself for all I care, black pepper grounded coarsely and fresh thyme. Don't even read further if the thyme is not fresh. Just don't . Forget it. Oh, you have fresh thyme? OK. You can go on. Now get some real garlic. Not that “made in China” shit that composed 90% of what in your supermarket (I'm not shitting you, 90% of the garlic you find in your store are now made in China. Half of it grown with human waste. You can send a nice thank you letter to the FDA if you wish). OK, now you have the right fucking garlic. Cut it nicely like uncle Pauli, meaning super thin. Cut 4 buds. Toss it in the bowl with everything I said earlier. Watch your fucking hands like you are going to operate someone. Done? OK. Now mix the whole thing in the bowl with your hand. 

Now set the oven like it is hell inside, like cowboy style. Put it in the oven. Cook 35 minutes. The house should smell like an Italian girl comes in your house and suddenly want to have sex.

You should stay on this so don't do anything else until those bones are done.

OK, the cashier will ask you what the hell this is, guaranteed, and you'll tell her, “you know, there is more than chicken and beef out there!”... anyway... cut the leeks along the length and clean it thoroughly (sand love to stick on those). Two branches of celery only. Two large white onions, the kind to make a grown man cry. Cut them only in half. Half a cup of tomato paste. (the ingredients should read: “Tomatoes”, no salt, two cloves. A huge bunch of curly parsley, it's a veal stock

All right. Now you have your stock that took you a whole fucking Saturday to do

Start with one nice big onion cut in small cubes in grape seed oil. Not olive oil. Grape seed oil is also an Italian  (and French) thing. It has not cholesterol, that oil is from the Gods, and the US corporate food hates it and never uses it. So it must be good.. Meanwhile, crush four canned anchovies in a small bowl. I know you American won't like it, but I promise you: you will never feel nor taste it, it's just like a natural MSG that, if you don't tell anyone, but it does make a hell of a difference in the deepness of the overall taste. Now saute the onion in a large

Half way until brown put the anchovies with the onion and mix... yes...i know...  it will smell horrendous in the first minute.. like some bad smelly socks.. full of ammonia.. ... yes... I know.... but then things starts to transform and the smell becomes amazing... well, put your grounded beef, grounded veal and grounded pork, equal parts. For 4 persons? Try half a pound of each. If you can't find ground veal, do half beef half pork. That's all right. You will just miss on something extraordinary, but you can keep on reading. Anyway, now the fishy smell should be gone. Toss in it one full garlic clove minced. Mix well on full fire. Add one full tablespoon of salt

When all the meat seems cooked and the proteins starts developing into an inconvenient crust at the bottom it is time for the wine to come singing. Red. Dry! One full cup to start. OK... I forgot something... Have this cup of wine hot on the side. You don't want to stop the cooking process by pouring cold wine on the meat! So heat up the wine just 4~5 minutes before doing this. Now pour the how wine on the meat and toss a pinch of coriander in it. The latter kills the taste of alcohol and leaves the warm taste of the wine intact. Whatever... just

Open it up. Now it is smelling like fucking heaven and the Italian girl is really all over you. Hold her up by pouring more wine in her glass and come back to the stove. Put your dick on your hear, the sauce does not need to be this fucking “red” like corporate food wants you to believe. Taste it, you'll understand) Mix well. Add a nice bunch of big basil leaves in it. If you want to add great quality mushrooms, or some oil infused with it, here's the time. Cover again. Add a cube of unsalted butter. Don't ask why. Cook 20 minutes more on low fire.

Kill the whole thing. Keep it covered. Cooked your spaghetti the heck you want it to be done. Toss with the sauce in a way the pasta does not swim in it

A few updates based on some of the comments I've seen made on this thread: 

1. Quite a few male cooks have a rather conveneint arrangement: they cook delicious food

2. Apparently, ""I find a guy who can cook and wants to cook with me to be super sexy."" I'm thinking this might be the substance of a good pick-up line. Like, ""Heh, baby, I'll make you something in my kitchen if you let me buy you a drink."" Or something.

3. It's common for men to cook and women to bake. I'll just go out and say it: I find baking to be more challenging than cooking other dishes. It's difficult because you can't adjust the flavors in the middle of the process. Baking tends to be more of an art. My buttermilk biscuits never turn out exactly the same. 

4. Many people have dads that also were the head chefs. The most cooking my dad accomplished was tasting my mom's spaghetti sauce on white bread.

I wrote this as if it were for a new graduate just moving out on their own into a smaller apartment.  The idea was to get you started with something inexpensive yet allowed you to make tasty yet inexpensive food.

Here goes


Part 1

**Hardware – Marshall’s

*Chef’s Knife* – You must get one of these.  If you are on a budget go for a cheaper version

*Large Cutting Board* – Preferably dishwasher safe (if you have a dishwasher) so you can cut raw meats and not worry.  And yes

*One good size stockpot* – For chili

*One medium to large skillet* – This can be cast iron if you are open to that (I am a huge fan of them).  The one I got was like $25 and you can do anything on there

*One medium pot* – Forever Alone?  You don’t need to boil a lot of water, etc

*Pepper Mill* – You don’t need to go high class

*Cheese Grater* – Most likely the box grater that has 4 options.  Remember

*Meat Thermometer* – A cheap investment that will make even the best cooks better.  Great for rookies who need some help

*Mini Food Processor* – I’m not going to say this is optional

*Handheld Mandoline* – Optional, etc)


Part 2


**Dried Goods – For the pantry**

*Olive Oil* – This is what you should use 95% of the time for the fat.  Why?  Because it is one of the “healthier fats” and you want to look good in case you ever do have a conversation with a person of the opposite sex, any will do, but bite the bullet and get the big ass tin which could range from $20-$30. The small little bottles actually cost you more than twice per ounce than if you buy the big one.  Costco helps

*Pasta* – Spaghetti type and a tube type should be enough.  While at grocery store don’t ever ask yourself if you need pasta

*Dried Herbs* – They keep for up to six months and are great for potent flavors and are to be added at the beginning of making your dish (i.e. oil simmering with garlic and onions

*Rice* – No brainer

*Canned Tomatoes* – Always keep one of each (crushed/diced, oil and dried herbs plus one 16 oz can of diced or crushed tomatoes, one 16 oz can of tomato sauce and the small can of tomato pastes?  That should cost you maybe $3 bucks total and will last just as long and taste a helluva lot better than the jar.  Tomatoes are very versatile.  Use em to finish off a pan sauce once you have deglazed the pan (see tips and tricks below), they work well in soups, stews and chilis obviously

*Kosher Salt* – Only way to go

*Whole Peppercorns* – see Kosher Salt

*Stocks or Broth* – Again

*Corn Starch* – You want to thicken something?  Put corn starch in a small bowl with a liquid of your choice (milk or cream if making mac n cheese

*Canned Beans* – Back when I was a bachelor a can of black beans and some hot sauce was a meal.  Shop the sales

*Wine* – Red or White, lamb and beef.

*Balsamic/Red Wine/Sherry/Champagne Vinegar* – A little goes a long way in flavor town (heyo Guy Fieri

*Dried Mushrooms* – These are expensive at Hippie (Whole) Foods

*Hot Sauce* – I am not African American, Cholula or the great Sriracha

*Baking Soda* – I am not much of a baker, herbs and other glorious meats I throw in there, not like Pizza Hut’s shitty excuse for a sauce.

Part 3

**Everyday Perishable Goods**

*Garlic* – One

*Shallots/Onions* – Any type will work

*Fresh Herbs* – These are tricky since they don’t have a very long shelf life, thyme and tarragon.  Refrigeration works, but I think it takes away some of the flavor.  Leave em out on the counter long enough and you just made yourself some dried herbs

*Parm/Romano* – I am a bigger fan of the latter, costs more.  By a wedge and when you get home take it out of the plastic, because the cheese is still alive and wrap it in wax or parchment paper and tape shut.  Grate only what you need when you need it

*Potatoes* – Again if Forever Alone you don’t want to buy a 10 lb bag since they will go rotten before you use them.  Shoot for a 5 or 3 lb bag if they have it.  I know red skins come in the 3lb bag.  Potatoes are cheap

*Frozen Veggies* – Don’t buy the shit that you can steam in the bag (giggle) or the stir fry mix.  Those are shitty veggies that they add stuff to and mark it up.  Buy the peas, just toss em out onto the pan

*Butter* – Lasts forever in the freezer

*Capers* – Here is me being an Eye-tai again

*Anchovies* – See above

*Lemons/Limes* – Extremely useful.  Since I go to the Mexican grocer these little bitches are always on sale.  They will last a few weeks and you can use em in more ways than one.  Remember that cheese grater I told you to get?  Use the smallest hole size and grate the zest off.  Once you have done that,False,,t5_2qh7f,True,,,t3_fvw20

We put meatballs on a pan as we formed them

I have listed the sauce recipe before, then tomato paste, mix that around until all together, then we add dried basil, dried oregano, bay leafs, mix again, puree them


We then took baguettes (we didn't make the bread), then meatballs, then fresh mozzarella (we didn't make the cheese). We then popped them into the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. After that we put sauce on the other side of the sandwich and were done:

Ingredients:
PANCAKES:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1 large egg

CINNAMON FILLING:
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon

CREAM CHEESE GLAZE:
4 Tablespoons butter
2 ounces cream cheese
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
1. Prepare pancake batter: In a medium bowl, oil and egg, just until batter is moistened (a few small lumps are fine).

2. In a medium bowl

3. In a medium

4. Heat large skillet over medium-low heat. Spray with nonstick spray. Scoop about 3/4 cup batter onto the skillet. Snip the corner of your baggie of filling and squeeze a spiral of the filling onto the top of the pancake. When bubbles begin to appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve.

5. When ready to serve

Tips:
*Keep the heat low or your pancakes might cook up too quickly. Don’t flip them until you see those bubbles starting to pop on top. Flip them with a wide spatula so you can grasp the whole thing without batter and filling dripping all over the place!
*It’s best if you pour the batter onto your skillet
*If your baggie of filling begins to get too thick, it will tend to run all over your pancakes. Once you micro it, let it sit on the counter at room temp for a while until it thickens slightly.

**FULL DISCLOSURE** - I did not invent this recipe. I saw it on a friend's Tumblr. The original recipe is [here](http://1nation.eu/post/9254862986/ingredients-pancakes-1-cup-all-purpose-flour-2).

1310578577.0,iom51,14 tips for making pizza dough,higherlogic,315,72,95,"This is adapted from Peter Reinhart's *American Pie* book:

1. Unbleached flour is always preferred over bleached because it still has beta-carotene

2. If you use an electric mixer

3. The trick for mixing with a food processor is to use only the pulse switch in the beginning and mix only until the ingredients are hydrated and form a ball. Then let the dough rest for 5-20 minutes before mixing again. The resting stops the processor from tearing the dough into strands. When you resume mixing

4. You reduce oxidation in your dough by letting it rest after it first comes together in the bowl. The rest period also allows the dough to hydrate fully.

5. Sticky dough will not stick to wet hands or tools. If you're mixing by hand

6. If you measured your flour by cups rather than weight, or sticky), don't be afraid to make the appropriate adjustments. In the end, the dough always dictates how much water or flour to use, not the exact measurements in the recipe.

7. Use the windowpane test to determine when your dough is sufficiently mixed. This is done by snipping a piece off and gently tugging and turning, or windowpane, it needs another 1-2 minutes of mixing. Remember to rotate when tugging, because even properly developed dough will rip if you stretch in only one direction. The windowpane means the gluten protein has properly bonded in the dough.

8. Wetter dough is more difficult to handle, puffier edge.

9. Oil or fat is added to American-style pizza

10. Less yeast and longer fermentation are preferable to more yeast and fast fermentation. Artisanal bakers are taught to use only the minimum amount of yeast to leaven the dough. More yeast speeds up fermentation, thus reducing the flavor.

11. If using active dry yeast instead of instant yeast

12. Overnight fermentation almost always improves your dough

13. Many pizza dough recipes are interchangeable. Napoletana and other soft, as they are difficult to stretch into larger pizzas. If you want to make a family-sized pizza, use the stronger neo-Neapolitan, New York, or Americana variations.

14. The best crust is one that enhances the pizza without drawing too much attention to itself. When the crust does receive attention, and the creamy melt-in-your-mouth quality of each bite.",,False,,t5_2qh7f,False,,

It was suggested by entropikone that I put them into a new thread. Well

This gives me somewhere to store all the recipes I keep in my head and gives everyone else access to them. They aren't much use to others when they're locked up in my head now are they?

So I'm going to spend a few hours today copying and pasting my recipes from various threads over the last 8 months

A lot of my recipes are based on different cuisines from around the world. I don't claim them to be authentic

Amounts and quantities are estimates

I hope people enjoy this thread. It'll take me a while to get every recipe posted so please be patient.

Warm regards
