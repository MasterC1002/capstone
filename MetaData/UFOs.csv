supposedly hit NW Louisiana Monday night? It's 
kind of a big deal here
and covered-up... ",48,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11oxo3/have_you_guys_heard_about_the_meteorite_that/,"Late Monday night there was a **HUGE** explosion in NW Louisiana, around an underground bunker at Camp Minden. The blast broke windows and shattered lightbulbs all around the area, and could be heard and felt more than thirty miles away. 

At the same time, and Texas report there being a very bright, orange fireball streaking across the sky. 

The story I've heard around here (from people that usually take little interest in things like this) goes something like this:

The first reports from the media and law enforcement say that

By the time the morning news came on, the company that owns the bunker canceled a press conference scheduled for yesterday morning at the last minute without explanation, so *technically* it still (3 days later) hasn't been officially confirmed. 

The sketchiest part about it to me is that Facebook seems to be censoring users' posts about the incident. Several people have noticed that if they try and post anything about what happened

This might sound like a ton of bullshit, too. 

[This is a pretty decent article, but it's an interesting read.

Craziest part of it to me is how many people here are talking about it. This area doesn't usually question things like this

Anyways

EDIT:  here's a video of a first hand account by a man from Minden who explains what he experienced:

My other Reddit account has personal information and I'd like to remain anonymous for the sake of my family's privacy. For those of you trying to sniff out trolls

Also, somewhat rambling read. I'm getting a lot out at once. 

Some back story:

My dad joined the air force in 1971 to avoid being drafted for the Viet Nam war. He was a brilliant man and quickly qualified to work in research and surveillance in several US and NATO air force bases. He was originally stationed at the base in Shemya, Patrick AFB in Florida, and finally Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs, CO, where I was born. He retired in the early 90's while I was still a young child and went to a technical institute and received his degree in Engineering. While stationed in Florida, he began working with AFTAC and after he retired, he found a job with SAIC in Colorado where he worked for about twelve years before retiring to Maine with my mom. For those who don't know, so even though he was a retiree

In 2007, the doctor treated for several different supposed causes to no avail. Finally, he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer that had pretty much spread all over his body. He had been a cigar smoker since he was a kid, so our family wasn't exactly surprised, but his doctors did note the cancer was unusually aggressive and hard to detect from his outward symptoms. By mid-2008, he was dead. 

My dad was somewhat reclusive in his life. He had many hobbies, and would pretty much drink from the time he arrived home from work until when he went to bed. He was by no means a bad father, but distant. I don't have a whole lot of precious memories of him and I together. However, one common interest he and I shared to an extreme level was in aliens and UFOs. Whenever A&amp;E or the History Channel had a weekend-long UFO show marathon, my dad and I were inseparable from the television. When I would ask my dad if he really believed in extraterrestrial life, he would give me the responsible response of ""it is impossible to know for sure, but I'd have to say that with the universe and big as it is

In the early days of his career at SAIC, or really what he did with his job in general, presumably because he was working with information sensitive to military defense. One time, however- and this memory sticks with me more than any other thought of my dad- after a weekend trip to Albuquerque, I asked him how his trip was and he told me that he had visited the giant city underneath down town Albuquerque. He told me it was a city built as a military base, but was quite similar to any normal city, with outlet stores and McDonalds restaurants for the military personnel's leisure.   

Now here's where things get weird for me.

A few years ago, everyone in the conversation looked at me like I was absolutely insane. ""What?"" I questioned, ""You've never heard of the underground government cities in New Mexico?"" My dad had spoken of his encounter so nonchalantly, I assumed that it was just general knowledge that the military had cities under New Mexico.

Somewhat embarrassed and curious, found no official record of any such place. Furthermore, the only websites that said anything of said underground city were UFO and Alien conspiracy sites. 

Why did my father tell me he visited a place that doesn't seem to officially exist and is only speculated by alien conspiracy theorists?

At this point, and in need of more information. I looked at my dad's obituary to get a more detailed look at his military career. Here, I discovered his involvement at Keflavik AFB in the early to mid seventies. I did another quick search, ""Keflavik  air force base aliens."" One of the first results was an ""official"" account of a decorated military member stationed at Keflavik in 1969 saying that the Iceland base housed thousands of alien aircraft in silos. Of course, I can't find the page again, but it suggested that my dad may have been around alien-military activity while he was stationed there. 

Now, but I consider 99% of ""evidence"" I see on the internet and television as ridiculous. Regardless, my experience appears very real to me. When I am at my best, I can accept that I'm probably just digging for answers with details that aren't really there but seem connected. When I'm at my worst, I believe my dad knew about alien life and was possibly killed because of it. Furthermore, I believe he was somehow trying to let me know what he knew or at least trying to leave me clues that he knew *something.* After all, my mom and brothers did not share the alien-mania that my father and I did. Maybe this was his way of passing something on to me.

Some miscellaneous notes worth mentioning:

-A few days after 9/11/2001, but listen closely. You can still hear plane engines, can't you?"" I hadn't noticed because we lived so close to the Air Force Base, the sound of planes overhead was something I had naturally ignored, but he was right. The sky was eerily quiet with the exception of two distinct rumblings of plane engines. I looked up and there was no evidence of aircraft in the sky.
""That's because Peterson is flying its experimental camouflage jets. This technology exceeds even the stealth bomber and basically makes the plane invisible."" That was all he said and he said it with the same non-chalantness he used when he told me about Albuquerque. To my recollection

-A friend of my father's that had worked with him in Iceland

-The last few months of my dad's life, he admitted some weird and disturbing things. When I implored my mom to go into more detail about what he said, she told me none of it made much sense and that she'd rather not have me think about my dad at his worst (though, she implied he talked more about experiences with his parents and immediate family rather than anything having to do with his work.)

-This actually just occurred to me as I was writing this

I'm curious what r/UFOs has to say about this. I'd love if someone had questions to ask me to possibly jar a few memories loose I've yet to remember,,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,True

""So this is human + - whatever that is. Definitely a child

""FYI: Neanderthals are 99.5% identical to human; Chimps: 96-97 %. Atacama humanoid skeletal findings not matching w known human mutations etc""

""...Movie is locked- DNA results will take another 6-12 months for more- this is complex.""

""This will remain an unknown humanoid. We need an expedition to the Atacama desert

""None of the genetic markers for the skeletal system we see (http://www.SiriusDisclosure.com ) are present in the DNA analysis to date. Strange.""

""The big story on the Atacama humanoid is the clinical medical one- much more so than the genetic one. The report is amazing- releasing soon.""

""We cannot state the Atacama humanoid is ET. But it is not any form of human ever seen. It lived for years on earth. It is not a fetus. So?!""

""I do not personally have the specimen. It is in an institute in another country outside of the US.""

""Claim the Atacama humanoid is a 15-20 week fetus: Nonsense - Google X rays of that and see the difference vs those in Sirius trailer. No way""

""CT Scan shows internal organs- specimen most certainly not a hoax- although we do not know WHAT it is! Humanoid

""It is NOT a fetus. The rest is partially true- found in Chile

""About a year of manual DNA analysis is needed and a proper expedition to the Atacama desert to see if there are more beings.""


So.. I like that Greer is staying factual here. It can't be said that it's an ET at this point, plus there is the 10% of unknown DNA. That raises some possibilities, taking for granted that it's not a fake or a deformed human:

- hybrid
- extraterrestrial humanoids have DNA extremely similar to ours because that is how humanoids and life arise in the universe
- there is truth the ancient alien intervention theory
- panspermia

**Update with my impressions**

**I posted comments with my full notes for each speaker.**

While I'd never been to a UFO event before

During the Q&amp;A many people would ramble at excruciating length about their experiences or ""the truth"" before trying to wrap up with a question. I was not at all prepared for the intensity and unruliness of the audience at this point. This was extremely frustrating for me. I would have preferred to see the speakers talk amongst themselves or take moderated questions. I strongly think that if a UFO event is going to take questions from the audience

I also do have to admit that when I got called on to ask a question

The question I asked was, and I particularly wanted something that Col. Friend could answer. Col. Alexander got me for my wording, pointing out that it's unrealistic to expect anyone to invest serious resources in a scientific study of UFOs because the government simply doesn't consider them a priority. Col. Halt said, ""It already exists,"" referring to the control group he had discussed. 

But the attendees were pretty much what you'd expect. There were tourists who had happened into the Museum and stayed for the event, a few new age-y looking people, and some members of the UFO media. 

There were a lot of cameras. I was  wrong about the no videography rule being enforced

It hovered at low altitude then took off. They were then debriefed and told this never happened (he said he was able to share this one story because the story about it broke out about 20 years later and it was ok to comment on it). 

He confimed that we have crazy interesting and involved underground bases dealing with this stuff (he's been to them).

&gt;""FLYING DISCS"" INTERRUPT A SOCCER GAME 
&gt;
&gt;From our special correspondant 
&gt;JEAN D'HOSPITAL 
&gt;
&gt;Rome
&gt;
&gt;For one week one has seen a little everywhere these mysterious machines with scintillating colors by day and night, Perugia, Bologna and Florence. 
&gt;
&gt;Testimonys of people in good faith who saw them - sailors who do not daydream, rather, they amounted per hundreds up to now. Since yesterday they are much more. 
&gt;
&gt;A friendly soccer game proceeded Wednesday afternoon at the stadium of Florence in front of an assembly of approximately fifteen thousand witnesses. In the full middle of the game, pointing the finger towards the sky, exclaimed: ""discs!"" 
&gt;
&gt;Immediately
&gt;
&gt;The two discs and others still, extremely thin. 
&gt;
&gt;In Rome the Florentin episode caused some surprise. One interviewed scientists of all obedience there in their pointing out that as phenomenon of collective illusion - if that was all about - it is a record
&gt;
&gt;""It is nothing. A million bipeds healthy of bodies and mind
&gt;
&gt;However, and if, well, you had seen what they saw, would you speak with as much certainty? 
&gt;
&gt;Oh! As for myself, in cold blood, that if it sometimes happens to me to see that, I would not believe my eyes. 


[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpCXkB-dLP8) is an 8-minute youtube video from an Italian tv presentation on the topic from 2008. Sadly it's in Italian

And here are [two](http://i.imgur.com/YWvZt.jpg) [scans](http://i.imgur.com/i7M6h.jpg) of an Italian magazine that ran the story in 2000. It's also in Italian

This apparently came at a time when there were multiple sightings around southern Europe

&gt;At 14.30 on 27 October 1954 in the writing of the newspaper came the call for an engineering student, several discs flying in the sky of Florence. At one stretch between the object and the dome of the cathedral there was another ""white balloon,"" faster than an airplane, then another ""disc"" and another still. Six objects left their strange passage of the ""flakes"" white like “cotton-like”. 
Then came the most glaring whose memory is still fresh in the minds of many witnesses who see the phenomenon. 

&gt;The substance was quick to disintegrate if held in the hand. Alfrede Jacopozzi, a director of the Chemical Analysis Institute under the University of Florence. Professor Danilo Cozzi, a colleague of Prof. Canneri’s, carried out a series of tests of the mysteries find. “It’s a fibrous material, which is highly resistant to tension and torsion. Once subjected to heat action, the material grows dark and evaporates, leaving transparent sediment that melts away. The sediment was found to contain boron, and magnesium. Hypothetically speaking

The images of the alleged silvery threads are found [here](http://i.imgur.com/Xh8vg.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/fn0kr.jpg).

It was around 9:15pm CST in Northwest Iowa - roughly around mid August, I thought they were satellites, but they were moving faster than the usual satellites that I normally would see, and as  I said - they were parallel to each other which is abnormal. Immediate speculation led us to pull over to the side of the highway to check it out. They crossed the entire sky span within a matter of about 3 minutes. Then they stop and start going back the way they came. I immediately knew this was my first UFO encounter- so I'm ecstatic. I then look in the distance to where they were traveling towards, and I see two more identical blinks of light travelling in the same parallel pattern going towards the first two. As soon as they meet up, it seemed as if they were very low in our atmosphere, about 500-800ft above ground level. They sit there and do nothing for about 1-2 minutes. Then it happened.... They took turns glowing an Orange/Red color. As soon as the first one would turn off its glowing light, there were two more.

**Travis Walton Abduction**

**When** 1975 (corrected)

**Note** Movie 'Fire In The Sky' was based on this event.

**Summary**
American logger who claims to have been abducted by a UFO on November 5, Walton leaped out and ran toward the disc. The others said they shouted at Walton to come back but he continued toward the disc. The men in the truck reported that Walton was nearly below the object when the disc began making noises similar to a loud turbine.

It was concluded after a polygraph test that the team were telling the truth, Gilson thought, ""five of these men had no prior knowledge of it"".

**EDIT 1:** FUCK WHERE THE FUCK DID GREER COME FROM (Let's try not to discount his presence and look past the conspiracy theories


**EDIT 2:** Ok, important foreign cases, etc. Although he did just drop a small promotion under his breath for Sirius; ""Come see Sirius tonight at 8pm..."". IMO this National Press Club disclosure hearing blows his documentary out of the water in terms of professionalism and organization and Greer knows it. 


**EDIT 3**: Canadian researcher Grant Cameron is now speaking on multibillionaire Laurence Rockefeller's request to the CIA and American Gov't on the UFO phenomenon. This is getting very interesting. I have never heard of this case before. Apparently Rockefeller threatened to write an open letter to the Clinton Administration and have it run in large ad format in every public newspaper available if a report was not released.


**EDIT 4 (DAY 2)**: New Code for use. Another 200 views for r/ufos. Now Sgt. James Penniston and other former Military officers are talking about craft contact experiences. Stream is going well for me so far. Stanton Friedman sitting in the background looking stern and calculated! Great to see this event brought out some heavy-hitters.

**EDIT 5**: Friedman just finished his presentation and he was on point! Much more defiant than he usually is. After they cut the footage he left his plant mic on and was talking to someone. He was being asked about Phil Corso and basically stated that Corso greatly over-exaggerated his credentials and sources (until he realized his mic was still on!) Grant Cameron is on now. Cameron made a great point: apparently on the front page of the Washington Post today

1366596789.0,1cu6ns,George Knapp's Update on Bob Lazar.,Dancing_Lock_Guy,109,21,36,"I thought /r/UFOs would be interested to know what's been happening lately. Investigative reporter [George Knapp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Knapp_%28journalist%29) gave an update on the whereabouts of and his thoughts on the notorious [Bob Lazar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) on last week's episode of [The Paracast](http://www.theparacast.com/podcast/april-14-2013-george-knapp/). Transcript runs for 27 minutes from ~1:15:00 to ~1:42:00. 

**Reader Question:** *Is Lazar still active in making his claims about his encounters at Area 51?*

**Knapp:** No, he did a couple of other interviews back there, it'll be 25 years next year. It was November of 1989 when we first revealed who he was. May of 1989 was when we did the first interview with him--blacked out silhouette as Dennis, and so twenty-five years next year. He did those interviews then, he did a couple more after that. But basically, he hates every bit of it. He didn't like UFOs before he got into the program, he doesn't like them since. 

I saw Bob two months ago, eight or nine years--and it was nice to see him. It was nice to talk about something other than Area 51 or S-4 or flying saucers. 

But he's quite happy to have left that all behind. Has no interest in talking about it at all. I think I'm gonna try to have to coax him into talking about it for the 25^th anniversary, it always depends on the mood he's in, you know. 'Cause he is the most reluctant UFO messiah you've ever run into. 

**Q:** *Has Lazar shown any actual proof of his claims?*

**Knapp:** Well, I can tell you that I wouldn't have spent 24 years working on it. But there's lots of proof. I don't know what proof people would need. I guess it's whatever would convince a reasonable person that something is true or real. And I think that Bob and his claims have met that many times over. 

Alright, different groups of people--and each time, this saucer-like craft came up over the mountains in the area of where he said S-4 was, the place where he worked. This big glowing object that performed maneuvers, then it'd go back down. And you have to ask yourself, ""Well, there have been no stories about Wednesday night UFOs; how did he know?"" The tests were the last time they'd videotaped this thing

Secondly, it really is a true place; I've confirmed it with Dulles Air Force Base, it really did exist. 

Thirdly, and then he found a card for the guy who had come to question him during his security clearance, and it was a guy named Mike Thigpen for an agency he called ""OFI"", which I'd never heard of, and I've been here a long time, but ""OFI"", in fact

How did Bob know? How did he know about the inner workings of Area 51, and asked him questions, not about, like, ""Where are the saucers?"", but they'd ask him questions about, ""Where's the cafeteria?"", ""How do you pay for your meals?"", **[Gene Steinberg is a co-host of the Paracast]** I've lived near this stuff

We were being followed around, messing with his house, they'd wipe things off of his blackboard, move things around. One time he goes to the gym with a friend, he's got a *gun*, he was carrying a weapon in his glove-box. He comes out, the doors to his car are open, the glove-box is open
somebody just messing with him.

I've been to his house when he'd get home, ready for trouble. This stuff was real--it was really going on, and it's hard to convey to people who weren't there, what it was like, but it was a really intense time. 

**Gene Steinberg:** *I gather from talking to you, is that you believe Bob Lazar.*

**Knapp:** Well, because they figured he would go ahead and leak it to somebody. I suspect that that might be it. I suspect that he, in a sense, might have been really qualified. He's not a PhD, he's not the most qualified scientist in the world, but he's a really bright guy, who has eclectic interests--hookers and machine guns and explosives and stuff--that's just quirky enough that he'd be easy to discredit. He had a financial interest in a brothel for a time. And then he got hooked up with an *illegal* brothel, they were able to discredit him

But he knew a heck of a lot of stuff that nobody else had ever said before, ""Were they in these hangers?"", ""Did you deal with element 115?"", and Bob passed. And it wasn't a close call, it was flat out pass. Four of these exams. How did he do it?

By the way, had a break-in to his house, and the only thing they took were those polygraph test results. He's a former police officer, a credible guy, his name is well known here in this town, and I think his testimony goes a long way. So how did Bob know? 

And here's the last bit of proof. And I don't know if it persuades your listeners or not, he said, ""By the way, I met this hooker and I helped her set some security gear and some cameras up in her little brothel, and by the way, this brothel's on the same street where you live."" I said, ""What?!"" I mean, I'm thinking,"" I said, ""You gotta shut this down now."" He said

I said, ""Look, it's gonna be shut down."" They decided to bust Bob anyway. Back in those days, not a whole lot of pimps got busted in Las Vegas, not a whole lot of hookers either, but they looked at Bob like public enemy number one! Parole and probation, grilled him about his background and this is the time, this is the time you come clean because he told them the same story he told me. Where he had worked, ""This guy's lying to us. He's told us all this stuff

Congressman Bill Bray *(sp?)* from Nevada, but I have no need to know about what his background is."" That's what they told the Congressman. You know, a lot of things like that. If Bob were a liar, that was the time to come clean, and in fact, he stuck to his story. I don't expect people to believe it. 

I have problems with some of it myself. For example, there's people like Stanton Friedman, who I respect a great deal, who did research on their own after the story came out, and, ""Aha! Bob wasn't at Los Alamos labs! He doesn't have a degree."" I reported that in the very first story--the very first story that mentioned Bob's name, we reported that

I think he's telling the truth. As he knows

**Co-host Commentary:** Well, just I guess last year or the year before that, we learned that one prominent UFO paranormal researcher, Phil Imbrogno had fake degrees. His degrees were not real. We exposed that fact with the help of one of our regular listeners. So, that of course ended that guy's career. But the question being here, now we have Lazar, supposedly we can't verify his educational claims. And when you see things like that you have to say, wait a minute, for intelligence experts to wipe away a person's entire educational history? 

**Knapp:** Well, I've given the opportunity to answer that, I said, ""Look Bob, this is a good time to come clean on this, if you a told a fib in order to get a job,"" and the fact is

I always thought--the problem I have with Bob's claims about getting those degrees is--to get a degree at a place like CalTech or MIT, which is what he's good at. You have to take literature. I couldn't imagine Bob sitting through World Lit 101--

1363004431.0,1a2tja,My experience with alien entity,geriotrion,124,39,82,"It was at night. I was woken up ( don't remember that part ). I was standing in front of a barely open doors. They were made partially of glass so I could see through them.

I was staring at them and knew what was going to happen. He was going to visit me. Now I couldn't tell you consciously who he was but I've just felt his presence.

He floated or had this strange way of walking in a fluid way. It seemed like he just levitated to me. First I could see his big

He approached me. His face was no more than 30 centimetres from mine.

He was a typical alien grey. But he was not short. I am 185cm and he was slightly higher than me.

He approached me so close that I couldn't really see anything else besides his big

Now

He started showing me things

I wanted to turn my head from him but I couldn't. His head was attracting my sight like a strong magnet. I could see vibrations coming from around his head

When he wasn't projecting feelings to me

I've tried to fight this entry into my head but I've never felt so overhelmed. I can compare it to dueling a modern computer in arithmethics using only abacus. 

Now I don't believe he was evil. What he has shown me was that we as a humanity are really not worth that much. He showed me my struggles

Next thing I remember

That guy was real and he's the most powerful being I've ever met/heard about. I haven't even seen such a powerful creature in any movie. He projected omnipotence and a deep sense of knowing.

What I also remember is that there were other beings like him but they really weren't separate. They either were different avatars of him or they formed a collective consciousness/had one purpose in mind. 

What I don't understand is why would he visit me and do those things? What purpose would that serve to anything?

It was 4 years ago but I still remember it vividly.

Sorry if this is not organized but I thought I would share with you

It really bugs me that people are waiting for CNN to broadcast a UFO landing on the White House lawn before they even think twice about it. Waiting to find a body or a craft. Yet were so easy to dismiss video footage. Now don't get me wrong
The reality is that we may not even be capable of interacting with them. We may not even exist in the same dimension. We really have no fucking clue what these things are but it's a phenomenon that has been around a lot longer than x-files.
What it comes down to, ""Why would somebody invest so much in a cover up?"" Well, personally, I couldn't think of a better reason.

Dr. Eric W. Davis, warp drives, and anti-gravity. Sponsored by the [Society for Scientific Exploration](http://www.scientificexploration.org/), the lecture was about a then recently published book, [Frontiers of Propulsion Science](http://www.amazon.com/Frontiers-Propulsion-Progress-Astronautics-Aeronautics/dp/1563479567), regarding discoveries from the NASA project. After the lecture, during a question and answer session, ""...properties of UFOs had guided the thinking and research of that initiative."" In responding to the question

In giving a reason for the secrecy,"" and that, ""...policy makers and decision-makers in charge of funding and programatics ... don't want to hear the topic of UFOs. So, for the purpose of doing this officially, [we didn't bring in UFOs], but we did consider it under the table.""

Dr. Davis was a technical consultant to the NASA project. He obtained a PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Arizona in 1991

Delving further into the subject, George Hathaway, and the unnamed questioner]."" He described two events that took place at the NIDS Utah Ranch of, ""...one scientist and one researcher seeing a wormhole, what looked like a wormhole, with a creature crawling through."" In the second event, ""...the ranch owners had seen an opening in the sky in broad daylight with a triangular craft that came through it. Dr. Davis then compared these observations with known wormhole physics. ""...that's an example of data that indicates a wormhole involved. Geometry tells you what a wormhole looks like when it intersects our space. It appears as [an intensely bright] point of light and then, it opens up and you begin to see the hole."" At that point

NIDS Ranch refers to the National Institute for the Discovery of Science, it's known for historical UFO, cattle mutilation, and other paranormal legends. Reclusive billionaire Robert Bigelow bought it in 1996 as part of an effort to fund a long-term study of these claimed phenomena.

Discussing the matter of UFOs and warp drives

He finally commented on the matter of anti-gravity, that would create a repulsive force that allows something to levitate up. And UFOs do exhibit that.""

In explaining how, you envision space-time as a polarized vacuum of a quantum zero point fluctuations. And, if you exert a field on that medium, the fluctuations are polarized, [and] that creates a space-time bending effect similar to warp drive and wormholes. We see that in aspects of what's predicted.""

The Breakthrough Propulsion Project was disbanded at NASA in 2002 due to funding shortfalls. Dr. Davis is now a research physicist at the Institute for Advanced Studies-Austin, and [advanced propulsion physics](http://alnaspaceprogram.org/papers/advanced%20propulsion%20study.pdf), commonly known as warp drive. He is currently scheduled to speak at the [2013 MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) symposium](http://www.mufonsymposium.org/speaker/dr-eric-w-davis-physicist/) on the topic of recent warp drive and wormhole research.

FULL TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS:

37m30s

**Audience Question:** Is there any thought to using the known properties of UFOs as a guide to your thinking and research?

**Dr. Eric W. Davis:** The answer is yes and no. Secretly, for the purpose of doing this officially [we didn’t bring in UFOs], but we did consider it under the table.

And yes, and George Hathaway and so forth. And we’ve been able to use that data as input to give us an idea, and that data does drive the concepts that we did derive later on [when we did] the book and went into the original NASA program. Like warp drives and wormholes. For example, at the NIDS Utah Ranch, where I used to work for Bob Bigelow for six years, we had the experience of one scientist and one investigator seeing a wormhole – what looked like a wormhole – with a creature crawling through, and then the ranch owners had seen an opening in the sky in broad daylight with a triangular craft that came through it. Well, geometry tells you what a wormhole looks like when it intersects our space. It appears as a very bright – intensely bright – point of light and then, that’s an example of two datasets that we verified at the NIDS Utah Ranch that match what I know as a physicist what a wormhole would do.

Warp drives. We haven’t seen UFOs do performances that adhere to the warp drive, if you exert a field on that medium, the fluctuations are polarized, that creates a space-time bending effect similar to warp drive and wormholes. So, we see that. We see that in aspects of what’s predicted.

Yes

You are the reason that we are - every single day - becoming more and more able to bring this topic into every day discussion. Whether you're the monitor-tanned

We all play an integral part of the discoveries and revealings in the times to follow. We blaze the path to true understanding of this quirky and elusive yet complex and intrinsically philosophical issue. Don't give up now

As any of you have probably witnessed by now

We're all here for the same reasons: our unanswered questions about an area of interest. One that

With the underwhelming fruit bore from the Mayan Calendar misinterpretations

But really

It wasn't akin to some sensationalist's misinterpretation of an old tablet, so why not ones that affect everyone? I chose to start by creating 'my' new world; one of encouragement, compassion. A world of unity, shared vision, and progress. A world where we might live long enough to harness the cosmos in ways that we cannot now comprehend: ways only visible from our places in the compassion-devoid, consumerist, head-down, too-few-hours-in-the-day trainwreck of an ideal.

There's no *fucking way* intelligences which are capable of their (alleged or otherwise) advancements would behave the way we do to one another.

This is where you come in:
1. Be kind to your fellow enthusiast. He/she
2. Be patient with your 'elder-UFOlogists.' Some have a large ego in this community based on either a swelling as a result of vast factual knowledge or, they've probably got something to show you that will add to your stockpile of 'evidence.'

TL;DR - be kind

**I was really hoping that I could get at least one picture to show you guys...but it turns out

**Feel free to downvote, I'm just glad to know I saw what I saw.
And again



Okay so my friend and I were sitting in his car having a coffee in Milton, orange, and white. It stayed in one spot, not moving to any side, away or towards us.

So we get out of the car and go walking a bit to see if we can see it any better

We stayed standing in this field for about an hour. Seeing things that might have been planes or something else. Then we see these two bright lights flying almost together in the same direction and at a very fast speed.

After these pass

It was huge. and close. and fucking huge.
A4
[EDIT]  http://i.imgur.com/F5Kv0.jpg

It had very bright yellowish/orange lights with a red light moving back and forth.

I have always been a huge fan of The X-files, I can honestly say that I have seen a ship. It's weird because I feel the need to not talk about because people will think I'm lying, or it was just a plane, or...something.

But I know what I saw
He tried getting some pictures on his phone camera, our night was filled with high fives and a bunch of ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT""'s being yelled out.

If any of the pictures on his phone turned out I will update this!

Thanks for reading people!


**[EDIT] Still waiting for my friend to either wake up, texts, or anything, so as soon as I get the pictures, I shall share. I think he might even have some video from last night I'm not sure. I know this seems like I'm talking out of my ass and trolling you guys, but I promise you that I'm not. I want to see if these pictures are anything myself, the suspense is killing me.**

After a few seconds of watching I found myself laughing at this silly story

The story goes :

A group of loggers in the mid 70's are behind on a contract and are working day &amp; night to finish the work they agreed on. One night on their way back to town, they turned there truck towards the light &amp; went to look. It only took them a few moments to come across the source of the light. All 6 of them to this day claim it was a UFO.

This is where the story takes a different turn from every other story you'll hear about. This story has 6 witnesses that all agree they saw a UFO. It's extremly rare to have this much first hand account from an entire group.

As soon as they got to the UFO, he says he was trying to 'show off' to the guys) As soon as he got close, the UFO started making 'sounds', which they suggest was it preparing to take off. Travis Walton began to back off, but was struck by a 'beam of light' &amp; knock 10-20 feet away. All the men in the car were in a panic at this point, and took of in the car. Several miles away, they regained themsevles, he was gone.

He didn't return for 5 days.

During the 5 days he was gone

What makes me question this story even more was that all the men agreed to a lie test. Now some will say this is not proof at all to anything, they all believed they saw 'something' that night.

I won't get into what happened to Travis during his 5 days gone

The thing that grabs me the most

They weren't looking for '15 minutes of fame'

I heard both sides of the story. I heard the loggers

Travis Walton vanished for 5 days.

A search of the entire area left no clues as to where he went.

Every one of them passed the lie deactor tests.

From that night forward

Travis Walton returned with a single mark left on this arm

They continue to stick to there story after 30 years. Not once had it changed.

Then I looked at the side of the arugment that said they all lied. 

They had even less proof then the loggers. The only argument they had was that they 'just made it up'

From the interviews I watched

After weighing everything after hearing this story a few days ago

There's no good reason not to believe them.

Even after saying that

Before you brush this off

It all seems crazy. But something did happen that night in 1975.

I'm curious to hear other thoughts on this story?",self,t5_2qhds,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11ex4d/the_travis_walton_story_do_you_believe/

Later on we had just left my house in the car. Shes looking out the window and asks ""Hey, look at this."" and I asked her if she was sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter (because she is kinda silly and could have just been screwing around with me) and she said yeah.... 
then she started freaking out.
So
At this point I could see that the road had an illuminated circle on it... presumably from the center light because I could see the strength of the light would increase and fade again.... it moved incredibly slowly over my car... and once it had passed over I looked out my window and saw there was an upper deck thing to it and it had a red light either on top or on the back of it somewhere. I could see the row of light beams clearly in the sky pointed away from my car... and heading further away.... then suddenly it was moving fast again... then I couldnt see it at all
There was no sound at all.... nothing... not even wind. Honestly I dont even remember hearing the traffic... it was silent and smoothly going through the sky not even like there was wind resistance. We both felt really weird when it was right above us

i have never seen anything like that in my life. and it was so incredibly close to us. i could see the lights on the bottom of it glowing on the road.... it couldnt have been more than 50-150 feet above the ground (estimating by how tall the trees it passed over are).
and when i reported it on an online ufo ""tracker"" someone had also reported seeing the exact same thing like 2 hours south of where I live.... and they saw it even closer. They could see the heat waves coming out of the vents on the bottom of it

this is what the other people wrote:

&gt;""This 21 engine triangle at about 1000 ft altitude or lower with no sound at all. (Not even the sound &gt;of cutting air at the speed it was traveling) At the time about 1139PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME as &gt;it traveled over my house at aprox. 500mph I had 15 seconds of view time and my son had about 8 &gt;seconds of view time. We saw the craft so well we could identify a single power source attached to &gt;the 3 cylindrical housings containing 7 vents for directional propulsion venting blue flames or blue &gt;heat giving the appearance of 3 lights. Possibly a plasma engine? However I have no explination how &gt;something of such mass could maintain current speed

now
and there is no way they could have seen all that detail if it was  1000 ft ... because I couldnt even see all that detail. i think they meant 100. and I am kinda doubting they know how fast 500 mph is lol... just making up numbers.... to do 115 miles in twenty minutes.... if continuous that would be approx 345 mph/555 kmh. and that doesnt count the times it was going slow.... or stopped or whatever else along the way.. also planes cruise at 500-600 mph... which is where i think they got their number from. and this thing didnt move or fly anything like a plane 
but i think that its the exact same UFO.

1365276769.0,1bt7dg,Alien base in Alaska,ufokingdom,86,22,12,"In his 1997 book Remote Viewers

Commenting on the skills of a talented remote-viewer in relation to matters of a UFO nature, the jewel of a glacial range northeast of Anchorage, housed one of the aliens’ largest bases.” According to Pat Price, the aliens that lived deep inside Mount Hayes were very human looking, differing only in their heart, lungs, blood, he added that the aliens use “thought transfer for motor control of us.” Price added: “The site has also been responsible for strange activity and malfunction of U.S. and Soviet space objects.” Rather notably

 It was in August 1947 that a highly impressive account of a UFO incident involving two serving members of the military was supplied to the FBI at Anchorage. The report began: “This is to advise that two army officers reported to the Office of the Director of Intelligence Headquarters Alaskan Department, that they had witnesses an object passing through the air at a tremendous rate of speed which could not be judged as to miles per hour.” According to the official report, the UFO was initially sighted by only one of the two officers, but he soon alerted his colleague to the strange sight. “The object appeared to be shaped like a sphere and did not give the impression of being saucer-like or comparable to a disk.

 The first officer stated that it would be impossible to give minute details concerning the object, and, from a comparison with cloud formations in the area, he determined that whatever the nature of the mystery sphere, it was cruising at a height of more than ten thousand feet. And it should be noted that to be at such a height and still be visible, in all probability the UFO must have exceeded by a wide margin the initial size estimate of “two or three feet.”

 When questioned, in his opinion, he considered the object to have been approximately ten feet in diameter, and compared it to “half the size of a full moon on an ordinary night.” This discrepancy in size was apparently due to the fact that the second officer believed the UFO was more likely to have been at a height of three-to-four thousand feet, rather than at an altitude of ten thousand feet as had been suggested by his colleague.

 The difference of opinion over the altitude and size of the object may or may not have been significant; the important factor, the FBI Office at Anchorage reported to Bureau Director J. Edgar Hoover that: “…

we have been able to locate a flyer [who] observed some flying object near Bethel, it is daylight the entire night. 

The time of his sighting [of] this flying object was about 10 PM and the sun had just dropped beyond the horizon. Flying weather was extremely good and he was coming into the Bethel Airport with a DC-3.”On approaching the airport the pilot was amazed to see to his left an unidentified craft “the size of a C-54 without any fuselage,

 and elected to make a 45-degree turn in an attempt to diffuse any possible chance of collision. The FBI noted that the pilot was certain that the craft was free of any external power source

The document added: “He called on his radio to the Civil Aeronautics Administration station at Bethel, could not tell whether the object was making any noise and stated that it was flying at a thousand foot altitude and estimated travel at 300 miles per hour.

 “It was traveling in the direction from Bethel to Nome, the FBI continued to receive and log high-quality UFO reports on a regular basis. Of those, one of the more credible related to a noteworthy series of encounters that occurred in Alaskan airspace over the course of two days in early 1950. Forwarded to the FBI by an official U.S. Navy source, the confidential three-page intelligence report paints a startling picture of multiple UFO encounters involving the military. Titled “Unidentified Phenomena in Vicinity of Kodiak, Alaska,”

 it concerns “a report of sightings of unidentified airborne objects, USN, patrol plane commander of P2V3 No. 4 of Patrol Squadron One reported an unidentified radar contact 20 miles north of the Naval Air Station, Kodiak, Alaska. When this contact was first made, Lt. Smith was flying the Kodiak Security Patrol. At 0243W, 8 minutes later a radar contact was made on an object 10 miles southeast of NAS Kodiak. Lt. Smith checked with the control tower to determine known traffic in the area, the radar operator, reported intermittent radar interference of a type never before experienced. Contact was lost at this time

My family and I lived in an apartment when I was young. We never watched any UFO tv shows, not even speak. I told my parents and we went to the doctor and he said it was sleep paralysis. For a few years the continued.

When I was 8 we moved north

I never suspected anything until I started to remember what would happen the instant before I woke. There was a blinding light. Nothing else.

Eventually I started to realize what was going on. I would wake up before this light sometimes

Now for the reason I am writing this. I have a deep scar on my left palm that my boot camp doctor asked about

Also I remember an attempted abduction. 

I woke up in blackness with that fear I wrote of. I knew something was coming. I stared at my door, scanning slowly,NAND the walked to the right wall. It didn't notice I was awake.i tried yelling but nothing came out. My brother and I had bunk beds, I was on the top. It looked down at him after walking between the right side wall and the bunks. I tried to yell and it snapped its head up and looked my in the eyes. It then reached towards my face with its long fingers. I tried to yell again but couldn't. I then put all of my might into my right arm and lifted it. I swung my arm over and attempted to hit it, but I really just tapped it. It's pulled back it's hand stared at me for a second. Then, while watching me it backed out of the room.

""During his CSETI workshop I was dismayed at the real Dr. Greer
By Knowledge Seeker (California) - See all my reviews

I followed Dr. Greer's activities with enthusiasm since 2001 when he established the Disclosure Project. I read his books, in developing free or low cost overunity energy technologies that would clean the planet, eliminate conflict between nations, and bring about a dignified quality of life and abundance to people all over the world. I still share these goals.

So it was with great excitement that I signed up for a CSETI presentation and a one day workshop with Dr. Greer that took place on November 13 and 14

Surprisingly, not to mention the multitude of outlandish remarks he makes with a straight face, such as his impact on the rogue MAJESTIC secret government. So much so, that according to him, he ""rejected a TWO BILLION dollars payout to shut up and abandon the ET disclosure issue"".

Needless to say

Again, I was becoming quite uncomfortable about him but as the workshop progressed my discomfort turned into dismay as I watched how rudely he treated some attendees who asked valid questions or made harmless remarks but whose timing or subject he deemed ""inappropriate"". I was truly shocked and could not believe my ears and eyes as I watched him lash at them with such scornful contempt. It was so bad that I wondered if this man was consciously trying to chase these people away. Dr. Greer claims to have experienced meditative Samadhi or oneness with all. If so, one would think he would have achieved a certain degree of enlightenment and a sense of kinship toward his fellow men. Why then was he so harsh and unkind? Did he forget these people paid a significant amount of money not only to listen but to ask questions as well?

The worst and most disheartening part of this experience was witnessing the CSETI's field contact protocol. At the site, radar detectors, infrared scope, etc. were arranged. Even though I don't doubt Dr. Greer may have had several ET experiences in the past, what I observed in the field that night is inconsistent with his hyperbolic claims suggesting he can vector ETs and make them appear. His actions and the facts demonstrated that at the very least this is a bold exaggeration. Not surprisingly, to cover up for this assertion Dr. Greer made sure to bring out a series of possibilities for a 'no show' prior to the field excursion. According to him, sometimes the ETs might not appear because

Conveniently, who would come forward to state that while meditating they saw this or heard that. Most amusing though were Dr. Greer's remarks at the beeps and sounds made by his electronic equipment. You see, according to him an ET he named Walter communicates via one of these electronic devices and Dr. Greer is able to recognize which beeps he makes. Additionally, the large quantity of ""WOW!"" and ""Oh my God!"" remarks coming out of Dr. Greer's mouth over unseen or imaginary nonevents was sadly hilarious. Often times he would point his mega laser beam at some spot in the sky and claim he was seeing a partly materialized ET craft. Of course, any one else saw nothing even though, according to him, many significant events were taking place that night because ""we were such a great group"". To make matters worse

I found this charade insulting to my intelligence

Because I experienced first hand Dr. Greer's tendency to fabricate, at the very least, he stretches the truth to the point where it becomes short of being an outright lie.

In the past, I would reject them and conclude they were made by people who couldn't handle the truth. But based on what I saw and experienced first hand, it appears Dr. Greer is in love with himself, and because he sees himself above others, he dislikes most people. However, he desperately craves attention so he created this ET disclosure platform to attract as large an audience as possible in order to obtain the recognition and adulation he sorely needs. In essence, regardless of the message, conferences and CSETI outings may be more about the money they bring than the message itself.

Furthermore

UPDATE 12/4/2009: In a letter sent to Dr. Greer, and two others, refute Dr. Greer's claims regarding his alleged ""briefing"" to them. To read this letter in its entirety please google: greer woolsey ufo watch dog.

Several of the places I have heard this information refer to this mystery as the 'Hall of Records'. They also reference what is known as the mystery of the missing cap stone that if placed in it's appropriate spot on the top of the pyramid that something amazing will happen


Anyway


Here are just a few videos referencing what I'm talking about with timestamps on when they talk about it.

-Time should be around 34:18


There are several so to make this post not so large I'll stop there and you can continue researching yourself if you wish.


What do you guys think about this?
If there really could be something in or around the Sphinx why hasn't someone thoroughly investigated it yet?
This second video even goes as far as to claim how to enter this hidden area via an entrance behind the ear of the Sphinx.

I suddenly felt very awake
I was staring around in a brightly lit room, but I felt like he couldn't understand me. He was greyish blue, with massive almond eyes and a tiny mouth. He was joined by another, who was physically bigger, and I felt as if I could understand their silent conversation

""She won't remember."" 

""I don't think we should start.""

The one who insisted on doing the ""surgery"" seemed to be higher in rank
Upon feeling that they intended on doing some sort of surgery I freaked out inwardly. I tried to keep calm, ETs, and UFOs. They obviously communicated telepathically, and people who'd been abducted often reported feeling as if these creatures had no empathy towards them, like humans to cattle. I thought that maybe if I tried to mentally communicate my anguish, they'd see me as a being closer to their level. I tried to project my thoughts, pain, anger

On a personal note, all we know is what we know and thus we preceive things based upon what we know. What if we didn't know that life could exist in space. Rather not exist in space but get from one area of the Universe to another (such as coming into our planet). What if the planets are like our continents and the ocean is the deep empty space between these planets. Like as if each planet is an island and in between these planets/islands is space/ocean. 

But what about the metallic

As to how these UFOs accelerate so quickly and seeming jump from one part to another may be similar to how quick our ocean dwelling creatures may be. Get near a fish and it quickly moves away.

Anyways

EDIT: Another thing to think about...some of the creatures that live in deep within our ocean actually look like flying saucers in a sense.

1329577512.0,pv97l,My sighting in 06. Changed my opinion. ,hedkase82,65,13,38,"Since I was 9 years old (20 years ago), etc. It started when I was in catholic school, Hopkinsville goblins

Flash forward to 2006. My buddies laugh and scoff at my ufo ideas, I had gotten my first Erich Von Daniken book at 14), to where I don't mention anything, but they know I'm a ""UFO nut"".  Me, and a couple of uberskeptic buddies decide to go out on a boat late at night in Lake Erie. I was 24, We were partiers, but I had gotten out of work late, We had snuck on the boat( was my friend's father's boat

We get into the middle of the lake, just water around us, with faint lights on either side. 

We sit with the engine off, when we saw a glow a quarter of a mile away from where we were, in the water. A little wierd, but my friends didnt say much. They thought it was a bouy with a light on it that flipped or in the water. 

Without so much as a sound, all we could hear is the water splashing down off of this thing, as it rose out of the lake, slowly going up above our heads. Words can't describe the beauty of this big bright light, with the water running off of it. Breathtaking. 

This thing was as big as a tractor-trailer; length-wise

I continued to watch in awe, hovered for what seemed like forever (probably a good 20/30 seconds) , and blinked out of existence. (My idea is, it went up/into space with such speed and velocity if we were to blink, we would have missed it totally.

I think to myself, i havent done drugs or anything. I was completely sober, and I still did not believe what i saw. I looked down at my friends, and they were wide-eyed, mouths opened in awe. 

They were dumbstruck, these things seem to be real. Needless to say, we immediately fired the motor back up after our experience and got the hell back to land and went our separate ways-

I had waited a few days, we submitted it to MUFON, where we spoke with an investigator, and never heard anything else about it from them. 

I just wanted to share this with you. I once posted this on the fantasticforum

TL;Dr? I saw a ufo rise out of the water of Lake erie in 2006 with two friends

I also know a lot of us are here because we've seen something

I personally don't appreciate the infiltration of conspiracy theory material and its supporters on this sub-reddit. I am no moderator here but this sub-reddit is about UFO's, pleiadians, 2012, Alex Collier, raising our ""vibrations,"" or moving into some new density of human consciousness. 

To claim you know more than anyone else knows only puts you in the realm of the psychotic. Yet you still hold yourself higher than the rest. Thinking you have some ""secret knowledge

I feel it is vastly important to maintain somewhat of a skeptical and logical outlook on these matters. Part of the validity that the media has in ridiculing the UFO community comes from so many of these outlandish claims. Sure, there is a countless number of people making this rubbish up. And countless more taking it at face value, and hive-minding in it. 

Now I am most certainly not opposed to thinking that UFO's are extraterrestrial in origin, that you, or the bat-shit insane blog you read has the insight that no other has, has the story, has the truth, is exactly what it is, insane. And it is giving us rational sky watchers a bad rep. 

So make your way over to abovetopsecret.com if you'd like to investigate and involve yourself in these far less than formal subjects. But please keep it out of here, go with a few pinches of salt. As soon as you start assuming you ""know whats really going on here,"" or allowing the words of self proclaiming contactees or sages to infiltrate your thought process, you enter a wildly fantastical rabbit hole with no exit in sight. 

Not that some of that stuff isnt fun to read and think about

**Experience 1**

Date: October 1999  
Time: Approx 11:00pm EST  
Location: Burlington
Summary: At age 15

The altitude of this craft is hard to state at this time I would have to say it was flying at or below commercial traffic levels

This craft was moving silently through the air with no visible contrail or exhaust.  The vehicle moved across the sky and out of view in under 10 seconds at a high speed. I at this time an unable to provide a solid estimate of approx speed of the craft

***This was my first experience with unknown flying objects***

**Experience #2:**

Date: May 2001  
Time: Approx 3:00am EST  
Location: Burlington

This experience shook me to my core. I am going to summarize as succinctly as possible.  

At this time, my bed at the time and is a loft bed, which sits next to a 4'x2' window. I usually fell asleep with sports center on just for some white noise and sleep in just a T-shirt and underwear (this is imporant).My parents, due to bad grades had taken my remote for my television, which is why I would just leave it on over night......I am completely conscious,  I am completely aware...I had not fallen asleep, I do not believe I was suffering from sleep paralysis...as I lay down in bed my nausea and headache become less severe.    

This is when it happens...My room fills with radiant bright light...there is no sound

I regain awareness in a supine position. I am unable to move but I am alert. I am not able to open my eyes but my eyes are still functioning under my closed eyelids...there is an intense and blinding light shining directly down on me. I am able to make out movement and shadows moving around me....silently...the only noise is a slight hum. I am laying on what to my sense of touch a metal/smooth apparatus. I am still unable to open my eyes

I woke up, it is not sensitive to touch with no obvious signs of foul play. My first instinct was to check where I was injured...I did not even realize that my Television was turned off and the T-shirt I wore to bed was gone until a few seconds after becoming aware...I get out of bed and it is well after 4am.     

The next morning
This was so frightening to me that I only recently told my wife

I took a photo of my ""scar""...Its not easy taking a picture of your own back so sorry if its not too clear

TLDR: Saw Triangle UFO-2 years later had what I would describe as an abduction experience.

Note: They did not move in position and I don't really remember watching them leave. If anything I just remember them fading away. I honestly forgot about the incident until earlier this year when I was browsing through my camera files.
I then uploaded it to YouTube and let it be

I have showed the video to close friends and family and they have no idea.

Hopefully someone in this community can help identify this UFO(s)

Here are the FACTS: I am a commercial pilot in the United States with almost 6 years of employment with my current company &amp; 4000 hours flighttime in my career. Last night (6/9/2013) at 2330 eastern time while flying westbound roughtly 40 miles south of Columbus

Anyways, but going at about the rate you see the ISS move through the night sky. (easy to follow with your finger if you point and follow.) I checked our TCAS to be sure it wasn't an aircraft, even though no standard identifyin strobes/anti-collision lights were displayed. No aircraft above us registering. THEN, it got weird. The light started to pulse as it moved across the night sky. And I only noticed this when it faded to black, then 3 seconds glowing white, followed by 4-5 seconds of ""off."" This continued until it faded into the sky to the northwest somewhere WNW of Colombus, OH. 

It's impossible to say at what altitude this object was. It was ABOVE us. The other pilot with me observed the UAP as well and we chatted about it

When I was about 9 years old (Currently 20) I woke up once in the middle of the night and went into my kitchen/ family room to get a drink. I looked out the window and there was a figure standing on the parkway, with about a 15 foot wing span (both stood about 7 foot tall) which he folded into a cloak, and they ""talked"". They didn't have mouths. They have a ""mouthpeice "" similar to the Bane Mask, large almond eyes, that were human like (white with pupils). They weren't making  any noise but there body made it seem that they were speaking. After about 5-10 minutes they unfolded they're wings ( the cloaks) and flew off , and they're was a bright flash in the sky, similar to heat lighting

I know there wasn't a dream because the flash woke up my mother and brother and we all remember the flash

It followed them for a long while until the officers became uneasy/suspicious. They pulled over to let it pass, and two men in black got out.

1356346391.0,15dbx7,“People have been killed. People have been hurt. It’s more than observational kind of data.” -- Robert T. Bigelow,thirdoffive,60,19,40,"I'm sure most or all of you know who [Bigelow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bigelow) is but I'd never seen this quote from him so I figured I'd post it.

Here's a [link for the NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/science/space/08space.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) he's quoted in and here's an excerpt with some broader context:

&gt;His space stations are not his only interest in space. “I’ve been a researcher and student of U.F.O.’s for many, if people bother to do quality research, come away absolutely convinced. You don’t have to have personal encounters.”

&gt;He added: “People have been killed. People have been hurt. It’s more than observational kind of data.”

I was reading [Jack Sarfatti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sarfatti)'s website and there was an [entry](http://stardrive.org/stardrive/index.php/blog/former-governor-jesse-ventura-cites-me-in-show-on-robert-bigelow-s-skinwalker-ranch.html) talking about how he was cited in an episode of *Conspiracy Theory* concerning Bigelow. I watched the episode and that's what led me to the NY Times quote.

Personally I thought their portrayal of Bigelow was pretty unfair and over the top but the show was interesting nonetheless.

Another interesting thing in that [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQVZ-4PCIA#t=9m35s) was that they say Dr. Sarfatti claims he was told by ""reliable sources"" that some of Bigelow's people who were investigating the [Skinwalker Ranch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinwalker_Ranch) were attacked by extraterrestrials.

In Sarfatti's entry I linked to previously he says ""*have no objection. What they summarized is completely true.*"" He goes on to say

One more thing to note is that in that episode of Conspiracy Theory they say that Bigelow was referring to the [Colares UFO flap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colares_UFO_flap) not to his own investigators when he referenced people being injured/killed to the NY Times.

I'm actually really blown away how many well-documented multiple-witness accounts there have been. Pilots, police... amazing information that anyone interested in UFOs should review.

There are those who refuse to call witness testimony 'proof', and were both embarrassed and fearful of being seen as crazy thanks to years of ridicule from our society.

I can only guess that the people who dismiss these eyewitness reports as non-evidence are just really bad at understanding people's motives and at understanding human behavior in general.

You will hear some amazing hallmarks of valid accounts: fear, the strong desire to get answers, and weirdest of all, their confusion about why nobody in government or military institutions has any interest at all in hearing about these sightings. Every single caller had basically been dumped on the NUFORC, and Robert Gribble just takes it all in stride and tries to reassure them. Absolutely fascinating!",,False,t5_2qhds,True

I filed a report with the National UFO Reporting Center

But it was scary! I had to do something other than sit there and wonder. I already couldn't sleep. Might as well distract myself

I'm assuming you guys might appreciate reading my report and if you have any questions or you think I should do anything else

If I shouldn't in fact be posting this here

I couldn’t fall asleep, but no, then another appeared and I realized they were moving very smoothly in different directions. The movements were very subtle but I could tell they weren’t moving in a straight line like an airplane would because I compared their position to my blinds. They were kind of just white lights. I kept eye contact on one and realized it seemed to have one bright light (or big light) in the center and many small lights circling that, like a stereotypical flying saucer I guess. I think since it was so dark the lights were all I saw, and I really didn’t see a distinct body or shape, but because of the placement of the lights I could assume they were somewhat disc shaped and more convex at the top and bottom. They weren’t flat discs. (more like lemons from the side view.) I was the only observer from my point of view, but I hope that other people in my area saw these as well. [I took out the first sentence of background info because I don't want to give out that info here.] I suppose it might be useful to know that I’m perfectly healthy, so that’s pretty nice. I also haven’t taken any drugs or medication, thank you to whoever keeps track of this site and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I had no idea this sort of service existed and right now I’m glad it does.

**Preliminary results:**

* Almost a half of the sightings are of lights in the sky;
* 1/4 of sightings is of a singular objects; 
* 5/6 of the sightings happened at evening-morning time;
* Half of the sightings lasted less than one minute;
* 70% percent of the sightings had one or more witnesses to the sighting except for the person reporting;
* In more than half of the cases there are no nearby military or civilian airspace installations;
* About 15%-20% of the sightings included unidentified objects performing maneuvers that our conventional aircraft aren't capable of;
* About 1/3 of the sighters reported that objects were either glowing or blinking or had other light effects to them;
* Observers couldn't correctly identify the size and distance to the object in most cases (this statement needs further investigation);
* 1/3 of responders had more than one sighting.

He has never cared for science fiction

A few weeks ago he was in Rome with some friends and they saw a cigar shaped UFO moving completely silently over a nearby road while they were sitting on the tailgate of his truck. He said it was so close he could have hit it with a rock

He described it as a ""long black tube with 2 lights, there was no swaying movements from wind or anything to make it seem light like a baloon and it wasn't windy at all so it wasn't just floating on the wind. He said it was following the road going kind of slow, maybe 10 mph and was only about 20 feet off the ground. If there were power lines or street lights it would have run into them.

He said it was about 75 to 100 feet long and about as wide as the road. He said there was something on the sides like stubby wings or engines or something

He thinks it must have been some type of military blimp or secret aircraft. What's really annoying is that he is a photographer. But he said it was fully dark outside and even if he had his camera out it probably wouldn't have captured anything.

I figured I'd find a subreddit dedicated to UFOs and maybe find some kind of interesting discussion about this. Maybe someone has seen something similar?

My personal takeaway is very mixed. I used to love UFO stuff. I used to believe in the Roswell crash and I've researched the UFO phenomenon extensively. After years of searching I've come to be very skeptical of the whole thing. There are certainly strange sightings but i never thought someone so close to me would have such a bizarre sighting. 

I've rarely ever heard of someone being so close to a UFO. Most of the sighting are somewhat distant

Anyway


Edit:
OK, but I have stated it so many times on Reddit (and before that Digg) that I felt I would just be repeating myself... and I dare say after reading it, a few of you will remember it. Anyhow, here is a whole repost, from 2010.. with a few changes:


Everyone's a skeptic until they have seen one with their own eyes

There are a multitude of pilots


**Here is my own UFO experience:** Around Christmas 2006 (summer here in Australia)

The object appeared from the SSE, it was shaped pretty much like a Imperial Star Destroyer from underneath http://www.obh.snafu.de/~madley/starwars/dataimg/imperial_star_destroyer.gif ) , extremely massive, completely quiet and appeared to be at a very high altitude. There were lights underneath and some were flashing. Unfortunately, due to surrounding trees and and a nearby cliff, the object - which to us seemed to be moving super fast - was only visible for a short time, maybe 10-15 seconds/

 We don't know where it was from or who made it, a normal plane, and it wasn't Jupiter.

My friend was convinced it was about 6-10Kilmeters long, thing was fucking huge.

At the time we thought it was a top secret military craft - to chunky for aliens IMHO - I reckon reverse engineered stuff.

I don't own this property anymore, you can put it straight into Google Earth, and it'll show you our sighting location: 28°41'57.74""S 152°41'29.85""E

Yesterday, with its windows to the south, looking over Mälaren. There was a bright red light, going from the west to the east, very quickly. At first I thought it was a helicopter, since it was flying very low. You could tell because it was cloudy, and the light was below the clouds (I'd say it was about 70 - 100 m above the ground). The lake froze recently, happens every year. But something didn't seem quite right about the light. I didn't recognize the way it behaved. The light (there was only one, and so straight! It looked odd. Aircraft usually don't go in a straight line exactly perpendicular to my view like that

Anyway. I decided to get out to the balcony for a better look. As soon as I got out, would be if it was close. But no noise what so ever. Also, if it was that close, I would've seen the body of the aircraft. I didn't. (Even though it was evening, it is quite bright at evenings because of all the snow, especially when it's cloudy since light is reflected from the city.) It was just an extremely bright, red light.

I just stood there, that may or may not be impressive in terms of speed. It was hard to judge the distance as the only thing I saw was a [rather big, as if close] point of light.

Not that I think it would have mattered

Absolutely not saying it was aliens. Just a strange craft I couldn't identify.

Any ideas?

TL;DR

sustained bright red light, no visible body, no sound, going in a straight line at maybe 100 m from the ground

If you are still reading this: I took a video (that doesn't do what I saw justice

I was sitting outside my house one night this Summer going through some texts in my phone and waiting for a friend to get to my house for an evening walk.  Suddenly I became aware of my iTunes or Pandora being too loud on my phone and-- even though I mentally reminded myself that I hadn't been listening to music I turned my phone over in my hand to address the volume button.  Immediately my ears picked up on the realization that the noise wasn't coming from my speaker as soon as I rotated my phone and in that instant I was physically disabled by such a high pitch frequency that I was left in crippling pain.  

Since I live on a main road
merkaba.  It was in between my house and a shopping center on a hilltop that is a few miles from my house.  I watched in disbelief until an inner voice screamed to grab my phone and film it.  Which I did.  As the craft glided through the night air it seemed to illuminate quickly and then get dim.  Upon it getting closer to me I realized that it was a surface of orange flame

Another really interesting thing is that I was aware of two frequencies resonating during the time.  There was the ultra-abrasive high pitched one and there was a lower tone that reminded me of morse code and was not as consistent.  And the millisecond my eyes locked onto the ship

I had some mishaps trying to save the file to my computer and send the file to a friend.  A few other things have happened involving different times of day and other methods of contact.  If there is any way someone can do a screen show or look more into the audio of it I would greatly appreciate some technical help.  Also

They would likely know who Jon Stewart is, and might even enjoy the same music as us, or root for a specific soccer team. Kind of makes you feel like we may be a sort of extended community.

Who knows, I would imagine there would be a lot more ""Pro-Extraterrestrial"" type media and opinions being perpetuated rather than trying to slowly reveal themselves through sightings like we hypothesize. I think the fact that we don't see it is sort of a bullet point for disbelievers... and it's hard to argue with that.

Regardless, though, that I'm agnostic on the subject.. and I could never say that aliens are 'definitely' visiting us, but there is very compelling anecdotal evidence to keep in mind.

1343662974.0,xe8l4,Why attribute ancient structures and complex crop circles to extraterrestrials?,ofthe5thkind,55,16,153,"Some of the below has excerpts from previous posts I've made

From the [Crabwood crop circle](http://mmmgroup2.altervista.org/e-crab.html) to the Egyptian pyramids

I trust we can all acknowledge that there have always been mathematicians, and supernatural beliefs in our known human history. They had, biologically, the same brains that you and I do, and they were capable of thinking about the same concepts that you and I think about today. Despite this, some claim that there's *no way* that we had the knowledge to achieve what we've achieved without extraterrestrial interference. I maintain that this suggestion severely underestimates the intelligence of our predecessors, and dismisses what we know human beings can accomplish when they are focused, and in groups.

Eratosthenes, and [he did it by referencing shadows on the ground during the summer solstice and using a bit of math](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Eratosthenes.27_measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference). Seriously! And even before that, Anaximander (who got many things *very* wrong) suggested [an early form of evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander#Origin_of_humankind), placing the origin of human beings in water. He was right.

Just because we understand how the pyramids ([Egyptian, not too long ago, a carpenter [built his own Stonehenge in his backyard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCvx5gSnfW4). No assistance needed. Sometimes I wonder if the only reason that the Taj Majal isn't connected with ancient alien theories is because it was built in the 1600's!

These weren't premature humans building the pyramids, figuring out that willow bark helps with pain, or observing the skies to create extremely accurate calendars. They were just like you and I. However, most explanations of observed phenomena in the old texts are very clear: we really, *really* had no idea what was going on around us. Consider that until [Germ Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory), illnesses were still widely attributed to punishment from God and/or demons. This was *less than 200 years ago!* Incredibly, some people still believe this. Exorcisms still actually happen.

Consider this, truly believed that witches, warlocks, familiars, hexes, demons, and magic existed. What was their evidence? Well, the results of which would prove or disprove your mystical powers? And it didn't stop in the 1690's! People are still executed for these things today in parts of the world. Conspicuously

So everywhere we look

And now, too encoded with mathematics, too expansive to be designed and discreetly implemented by us in the dead of night. It makes no difference that [we already know how they're created](http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/unexplained-phenomena/crop-circle.htm). It makes no difference that we can look around at all of the amazing, earthly achievements that human beings have made all by themselves. The supernatural penchant of our predecessors remains in us, and much like a stagnant pool of water to mosquitoes, this is a perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories.

I don't want to discuss conspiracy theories, and that's why they can't die.

Sometimes it seems as if discussions about UFOs are akin to fussing about the details of the 10th floor when the first floor isn't even finished being constructed yet. There are countless books and internet posts making claims to knowledge that depend upon us *not* being alone in the universe, or what we wish to be true, or what we assume or surmise or deduce. I'm talking about what we *know*.

Disclosure or ET visitation wouldn't cause the kind of ""mass panic"" that the government has gotten everyone to believe is the reason they can't say anything about it.  Constant fear has been drummed up in the population for generations

The *actual* reason that nothing has been disclosed, but because SO much other hidden bullshit would have to be explained relating to government manipulation and literal *culling* of the masses that the people would once and for all realize just how evil and against everyone the government and establishment really is.  Everything the MSM has presented is nothing but covert brain washing that the populace has been conditioned to accept.  As a result, everyone has bought into it and has sad ""Yes!  There WILL be mass panic!!""

Nothing could be further from the actual truth, there wouldn't be sufficient public panic.  Now that a good portion of the population DOES know about the phenomenon, however?  Even less so would there be any panic over it.

The fact of the matter is that everything has been drummed up and manipulated into the people by the establishment so that the people don't question any further past the government's excuse that the reason nothing's been disclosed is because it would cause ""mass panic"".

It's time that everyone break out of the lie and the illusion and realize that the real reason is because of all the very real questions the government would be asked and would have to answer if they were to reveal that they've been covering everything up for so long.  The entirety of society - of civilization

THAT'S what disclosure will reveal.

The ""mass panic"" that would occur wouldn't be mass panic as the population reacts to the existence of extraterrestrials.  It would be mass panic as the population reacts to how much of a complete and utter fabricated lie their lives and everything they've been taught to believe as citizens had always been at the hands of the government and the elites.

I've always been able to notice helicopters coming long before actually hearing them. Anyways.. I heard a helicopter coming towards us

It was triangle shaped and fucking massive. I know it's really hard to get a size reference of something that's in the sky... but really this thing was enormous. I would guess the size [height] of a 2 story building. One white light on each corner, while the white ones just kinda brightened and faded. It was moving towards one of the points of its triangle. After we watched it move over the house for like 20 seconds, it stopped, and froze in mid-air, and began moving in a completely DIFFERENT direction (it's orientation never changed) - headed off in a kind of easterly direction, in the direction another one of it's points was facing. It didn't turn, just straight lines towards it's points. Hard to explain :/ 

Anyways

At first I really thought it could be a jet going upwards and the tail trailing it but it didn't look like that.  During the whole time I watched it, it was just gone.  The jet had caught up to where the rod shaped craft was, but it seemed as though it disappeared before it got too close, and the jet eventually overtook the position of where it had been only seconds ago.  

It looked like one of those bar shaped UFOs that had been seen flying into the volcano

I can't explain how it appeared not to move the whole time I was looking at it.  I can't explain how it suddenly disappeared without leaving any trail.  This was right at dusk, because of the bar shape.  It was brighter than the remaining light coming from the sun.  

If anyone has any way to explain this away what I saw I am open to suggestions, and just seemed to disappear.  One last thing is that as I watched it, all of a sudden it seemed to have a faint pinkish glow, but I think that has more to do with the way the setting sunlight was hitting it.  It was hanging over the Ozark Mountains, in an area where there are no structures around.

I believe there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that proves there are unexplained phenomenon in our skies.  I accept as fact that governments around the world have expended great amounts of resources investigating and researching UFOs and to complicate matters some of these governments are simply fronts for the military industrial complex and the controlling elite.  

Obviously this is an over-simplification but it's a good approximation of how I feel about the matter. But once someone starts talking about hypnosis I get suspicious.

I'm just saying that I am extremely skeptical.  That is where I draw the line.
I am not out to change anyone's mind and I am prepared to adjust my viewpoint where warranted.  I just want to know where you guys and girls personally draw the line.

The ONLY thing in this scenario that differentiates this from the other stories I've read is that she was a child

Honestly, but she likes the idea better than her previous explanation that it was some demonic being stalking her bed.

On Friday night (11/9) at around 7:30-7:45 local time I stepped outside to have a cigarette before getting ready to go to a movie at 8:30. My girlfriend and I were standing on our back porch which looks out to the Northeast. Just as we were about to go inside

I stopped for a moment and then pointed them out to her. As we stood and watched

We have several trees in our back yard and a several houses behind ours, but as they continued to move, it never reappeared. At the same time, another light appeared from the East side moving in formation with the rest.

This continued for a couple of more minutes. As one would disappear to the left side

After a couple of more minutes

Before long several of the lights never returned. Soon it was just one light moving across the path until that one disappeared as well.

The lights themselves were just a solid red-orange color. They did not change color

Where we live we see planes going in for a landing at the airport all the time and it certainly was not a plane or a helicopter.

Let's start with some basic arithmetic to figure out how far away the next closest star is. We know that the closest star to Earth, which is approximately 4.24 light years away. Light travels at a speed of 299,792 kilometers (or 186,282 miles) per second. This is approximately equivalent to 9.46 trillion kilometers (or 5.87 trillion miles) per year. This places Proxima Centauri, our next closest star, approximately 40.1 trillion kilometers (or 24.9 trillion miles) away from Earth.

Instead of star-to-star, nearly everything that you can see in the night sky is a tiny little sliver of our local Milky Way galaxy. Our immediate solar neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is only [one of approximately 200 billion stars](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980317b.html) in our Milky Way galaxy, which stretches approximately 100,000 light years in diameter and about 1000 light years thick. When the Hubble Deep Field image was returned to us in 1996, covering [a speck of the sky only about the width of a dime 75 feet away](http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01), covering an area in our night sky [smaller than a 1mm by 1mm square of paper held at 1 meter away, the amount of galaxies in our observable universe hovers in the hundreds of billions.

We'll take the fastest,479 kilometers (or 38,201 miles) per hour, and as of March 2012, was about 17.9 billion kilometers (or 11.1 billion miles) away from our sun. It is now traversing through the heliosheath, and is expected to be the first man-made craft to leave our solar system and enter interstellar space [within a decade](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html). If Voyager 1 were to travel the 4.24 light years to Proxima Centauri, it would arrive in approximately [the year 74012 A.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel#Interstellar_distances) If Voyager 1 were to travel the 2.54 million light years to Andromeda, it doesn't really matter. The numbers are nearly inconceivable. And that's just travel to our nearest galaxy. It boggles the human mind to consider such distances when we only evolved to perceive the speeds and distances one would see on foot in the African savannah.

In order to accurately measure distances between the Milky Way and even further galaxies, which is a unit of length used in astronomy. A parsec is equivalent to about 3.26 light years. For every additional megaparsec (or one million parsecs, or 3.26 million light years) that a galaxy is from Earth, said galaxy appears to be traveling 265,680 kilometers (or 165,086 miles) per hour faster [away from us](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/cosmic-expansion.html). Andromeda falls short of a megaparsec by about 220,859 light years, gravity always wins. In astronomical measurements, it will be traveling away from Earth at the rate of 1, and we'll have to factor that in if we're to estimate the length of our journey with any accuracy. The first problem would be figuring out a way to catch up to it!

To paraphrase Neil deGrasse Tyson, holding the glass up to the sun, peering through the saltwalter contents, and exclaiming with certainty that there is no such thing as whales. Based on our most recent measurements, our universe is [flat and infinite](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html). That's infinitely more than enough space to accommodate other life forms. Yet [we haven't found life elsewhere](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_life.html), and thanks to the truly astronomical distances between solar systems, it's genuinely possible that we never will. Perhaps one of the universal unanswerable questions for all life forms to ask for eternity is: Are we alone?

At approx 10:15 pm est, Ohio:

I was watching the fireworks on television, and Boom. Here is a picture of the Columbus skyline at night. LINK for reference as to its position. 

http://imgur.com/M00Xss2

As the fireworks were finishing up and beginning to make their way into the grand finale, they were flying what appeared to be at or near the same altitude because the plane would block out the light when passing. Then obviously the object would reappear after it the plane passed by. What made it strange to me was it was completely motionless and stationary. The LeVeque tower is the tallest building skyscraper in Columbus with the patriotic colors displayed It appeared to be directly above the skyscraper from what I could tell. In full speed it was literally just a hovering light. So I decided to turn back my DVR and recapture the moment in slow motion or what im guessing to be half the speed. THIS is what I captured. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFgy8EqdnLk

I apologize for how shaky and out of focus the first video is

What you are witnessing is lights that are pulsing in which almost looks like a pattern if you view it a couple times. The little quick flashes of lights I am convinced are constantly being emitted from the object. I questioned whether (since it was on t.v.) or not the television feed/frame was catching up and manipulating or refracting the main light, or lights became distorted in any way. Not once. 

I posted the video on Facebook to see what people thought. Someone suggested Chinese lanterns but that we can certainly rule out. The only other explanation I can come up with is it was a helicopter. Here is why it could be a helicopter: Helicopters can become stationary and emit consistently blinking lights

Here is why I do not believe it is a helicopter: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhMeZ7oEEO0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=150s 

(hopefully it goes to 150s. If not skip to 2:30 for a shot of a normal helicopter)

In this video taken from red white and boom, the object does not necessarily match that of a helicopter. I read that helicopters can only fly at altitudes of up to roughly 10,000 feet because of their unpressurized cabins. models probably have a lot of variation. Well I have played enough flight simulator to know that the two planes that crossed the object were probably at least 10-15,000 feet. Much higher then the fireworks and a news/columbus pd helicopter or news helicopter would fly at      

Here is the final video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14mmJAhm7cA

Some final thoughts to consider. I interviewed several people on the scene. Two people I interviewed were standing 1/4 of a mile north west of the tower. Two other people I interviewed were standing probably hundreds of feet from the tower. Now without being biased and showing the video I asked them AFTER the grand finale if they had seen or heard a helicopter above the tower. Now it might have been noisy with 250, ""I cannot identify the object. That is NOT one of ours."" So there you have it. I still try to remain skeptical but I have shown a lot of people this now video and everyone has agreed that It is ""weird"" and ""very cool"" I would love to hear your opinions. A lot of people mentioned that it too resembles a shape of maybe a saucer? Thank you for taking the time to read this and keep your eyes on the skies!",,False,self,t5_2qhds,False,,
