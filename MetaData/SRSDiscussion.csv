**Why are minorities so annoyed all the time?**

When SRS rolls into town, and Caucasian-American privilege.  Often well-intentioned liberals and anti-racists have been game for a scuffle and have put forth some very excellent points.  I commend you.  You are a credit to all of our races.

However, they have to work to move the Overton window until their very civil rights become acceptable.

Now, it is often the easy point to make.  But there is one big problem.  It assumes that racism and racist policies just suddenly ended.  It implies that the system now works and it is simply groups trying to catch up that explains why they are so far behind.

 [AfAm educational attainment is about half that of C-Am and C-Am educational attainment is about half that of AsAm]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_outcomes_in_the_United_States_by_race_and_other_classifications#Education_Attainment).  [As for average salaries]( http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/HR%20Statistics/Salary%20by%20Sex%20and%20Race.htm), but C-Am poverty has been increasing toward it due to the recession, so as little as 5 years ago the difference was 50%).  If AsAms have twice as much schooling as C-Ams, why would they have higher rates of poverty?  The simple answer seems to be in legacies of inherited wealth, which minorities lack due to how recently they achieved access to educational opportunities. 

--&gt; That

So we hit a telling snag with the *echo of a racist past* point.  For example

Something has to explain why education and salary are not good indicators of socioeconomic status for some groups compared to others.

**Why are black people so annoyed all the time?**

Since I'm black and have far more experience exploring these issues from a black perspective

First, with no criminal record**.  More importantly, despite being only about 15% of the under-18 population, black youths are 40% of all youths tried as adults and 58% of all youths sent to adult prisons.  Black youths arrested for **the same violent crimes as whites** when comparing those with **no prior record** were **nine times as likely to be incarcerated.**  Nine.  Fucking.  Times.  **NINE HUNDRED PERCENT.**

Of course

But let's keep going

You see, white people, who are the largest population in the United States, [are the worst at making cross-racial identifications, particularly when it comes to black people]( http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/3501656-1.html) -- black people have no noticeable disability with cross-racial identification toward any racial group.

But how was he even put into the system?  Could it be the [ridiculous number of stop-and-frisks]( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/opinion/police-stop-and-frisks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss)?  The 400% arrest rate of blacks over whites in places like [California]( http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/Targeting_Blacks_for_Marijuana_06_29_10.pdf)?[The disproportionate sentencing once someone is found guilty of a drug crime]( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06disparities.html?adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1324587938-JA8OosWAi53x7QaNx/pGoA)?  That last part could be the reason more than half of all people imprisoned for drug possession are black.  It's not because black people do more drugs because they [engage in that activity at the same rate]( http://criminaljustice.ncbar.org/newsletters/criminaljusticefeb11/racialdisparities.aspx).  But seriously

Then again, longer sentences than non-Hispanic whites for the same crimes]( http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/sp/disparity.pdf).  And if the victim is white, the punishment is even harsher.  This is even more the case when it comes to the *death penalty.*  In fact, [the very crime of being black is enough to push your punishment into death penalty territory]( http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-black-and-white-who-lives-who-dies-who-decides#TheRawData).  Yes, I said *the crime of being black.*  There is as much predictive validity in being black for determining whether you get the death penalty as there is if you could have killed an innocent bystander.  Being black is nearly the equivalent of reckless endangerment for death penalty sentencing.

--------------

**But what does this have to do with black people being pissed off at white people?**

Well

[A study of 115 white male undergrads]( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207163811.htm) found that the *dehumanization* of blacks by whites made witnessing brutality against black people acceptable.  And we're not talking brainwashing,"" they were no more likely to find the violence justifiable against the white suspect whether or not they were primed, but those who were primed by these words were more likely to consider violence against the black suspects justifiable.

And

Or maybe not.  Maybe

Actually, white people tend to think that [*they* are the greatest victims of racial discrimination in this country]( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110523124220.htm), [46% don't think racism against blacks is widespread at all](http://www.gallup.com/poll/109258/Majority-Americans-Say-Racism-Against-Blacks-Widespread.aspx), and a full [63% of them]( http://www.gallup.com/video/108865/Perceived-Treatment-Minorities-Differs-Race.aspx) think that the way black people are treated is *completely cool*.

""But wait!  I voted for Obama!""  [No

But I don't believe that white people are racist.  I am reluctant to believe that most white people are racist.  Perhaps many of them simply don't know any better

**TL;DR:  How can sex work (pornography

Take this quote from [Derailing for Dummies](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html#disbelief) as an example of an argument I typically see:

&gt;   if a sex worker is making the claim that sex work can be a positive and empowering choice or the issue isn‘t the work but the stigma levelled at it

This strikes me as, but to me it seems as if this industry (stripping, prostitution, pornography) is largely defined by marginalization and dehumanization.

Also, for instance, could be considered ""empowering.""  The issue was never really resolved, but, to give you a sense of where it wound up, we ultimately were left more or less debating the merits of indentured servitude versus slavery.  My argument was that embracing the demands of your oppressors and internalizing them, perhaps even to the point (as in the case of Jenna Jameson) that you become an advocate in favor of others doing the same hurts yourself and others in a *real* sense (by perpetuating and, providing a rationalization for your oppression) even if it serves to improve your personal immediate circumstances.  This appears complacent to me

I don't want to be mistaken for *blaming* such persons for their situation or choices, at least) tailored to serve the male gaze and diminish women to sex objects?  

The vast majority of pornography I see seems to be almost if not entirely about the *abuse* of women.  I would not hold it against someone for trying to make a living in that industry, seeing as they are also women, how can something be simultaneously empowering *and* oppressive?",,False,,t5_2t5sa,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/10uki1/hang_ups_about_sex_work/

For those unfamiliar with this story, a user posted a link to a previo us post of mine wherein I had a fake wound for a Zombie walk, using this to disprove my story. Loads of users then rallied to scour my post history drudging up any information that would prove I was a liar.

For more detailed accounts of this situation

The situation then ended with me having to post a video of myself wiping my face with a wet facecloth to prove my wounds weren't faked. 

I was partially vindicated I guess, I contacted admins and such, and they were mostly helpful but more accounts just kept popping up to toss me some shit. Then I started receiving threats and jeers to my facebook, to my e-mail, and even my cell phone. I had to change numbers, lock up all my internet shit, and move. It was horrendous.

Above all, I was afraid to. I could come back, talk about how fucking unacceptable it was that I was assaulted, talk about how being injured as such caused me to be a semester behind in school, how I'm STILL going through emotional therapy and physical therapy, and how I endured all this with receiving daily death threats from some fuckheads who still believed I was lying. 

What would talking about this whole fiasco accomplish? I would be labeled an 'attention whore' once again for bringing up the subject. Beyond death threats and general mockery

1. You privileged fucks can't even recognise MLK Day, you chose to post that link. Why of all the things you could have said about MLK and the American Civil Rights Movement you chose *that*?

2. It's not about free speech. It's about not being a dick. Is there any reason you need to use the same lame, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic? Here's a hint chucklefucks: no. You're not funny, and it's fucking painful watching how everytime you go for the same groups of people who aren't you. Humour is powerful. It's *trivialising*. Show some goddamn respect.

3. Reddit has the most conservative 'liberals' I've ever seen. ""Tattoos make you unemployable!"" ""OWS look like filthy hippies!"" ""Ron Paul is great, male, cisgender) and fuck those people anyway, they're suitable only as targets from my humour! Yes, I know that you hear these kind of jokes from your racist uncle, but the difference is I do it *ironically*! Which is totally different!"" To these people: you know how you like attacking baby boomers because they were radical in the 60s but ended up voting for Thatcher and Reagan and selling your generation out? Fuck you, that's you in 30 years. Your disregard for anyone's interests apart from your own (see how much attention SOPA/PIPA gets versus, *anything else*) means you're well on your day to conservative douchetude.

4. Rank hypocrisy on liberal arts. ""Liberal arts are useless for jobs and won't get you money!"" Perhaps. Reddit almost never talks about how a lack of social skills will scupper your career progression far more. Frankly none of you have a fucking clue about getting a job with a liberal arts degree because *most of you don't have one*. Nonetheless

6. I don't know if it's the internet or Reddit but people on this website are *mean*. When I spend time with friends IRL they have flaws but they're basically nice people. I go on here and people are *nasty*. I don't want to be a part of that anymore.

7. Your treatment of women is appalling. It is impossible for a woman to post a picture without you either making sexual remarks

8. Your treatment of people with any kind of partners is imbecilic. ""Hey, I mean) and that stuff is sometimes worth of reddit! Shocking, I know.

9. But hey, we have a very good metric for seeing what people think: upvotes! So what if it's 1000 upvotes out of a community of 300,000? When you see a poll do you assume it's bullshit because they've not asked everyone in the entire country the question? Reddit has a *very* strong basis on which we can say that there seem to be very prevalent attitudes. And dear God there are some so very fucked up attitudes on here.

I've been a Redditor for about a couple of years now and these past few days

What hurts the most is that I remember arriving to this country at the age of five. It was also the Fourth of July when my family landed in the airport, the stars explode and rain down on you at night to let you know you are safe.

Growing up in America has allowed for many great opportunities in terms of university studies and furthering education. But it comes at a cost to some people, my kinky hair, and because there is never a moment in which I am not reminded of what my place in the stratum of society is, I have been subjected to the American experience of Being (with a capital 'B') Black in America. I've been unlawfully detained by police, unlawfully searched, not allowed to eat at a restaurant because I had a white girlfriend, received racial slurs from said girlfriend's family, heard countless amounts of 'nigger's and 'spic's thrown my way. I never let it weigh me down

But something about these past few days has put me in a slump, sisters, and any identifier that does not fall within the master's gender dichotomy.

I used to not understand why activists can come off as angry. I'm never an angry person and I've dealt with many horrible things just due to the fact that I left my house. Just because I went outside. ""Can you believe that?"" But if you are angry because of any injustice, it perpetuates the proliferation of hate and bigotry when we decide to be silent. I will not be silent.

Many on Reddit can claim and upvote that Black people need to get over playing the race card if we want to progress our race relations. That we are the bigger racists. That we get benefits when we check in a box that we are black. We get facilitated acceptance into a university if we check in a box that we are black. We get accepted into a job if we check in a box that we are black. I want these people to know that to know this: You don't check a box to walk outside your house.

Where does a person of color look for inspiration in the history of this nation? It cannot be with the founding fathers, no matter what any bigot out there who plays into the institution of ""White"" dominance may say. 

Take America Back? Take America Back? How do you feel marching to that tune? Especially when America was built on the blood, its infrastructure built by blacks. And you want to take America back from whom? To what?

I shall endeavor to explain why your [""totally funny](http://images.mylot.com/userImages/images/postphotos/2462581.jpg) racist joke"" is actually causing me real, honest to goodness harm.  And not just me, but everyone that the joke could be about.

Bit of background.  At my job, evaluate a candidate, and figure out if he or she (probably he) is a good cultural fit for whatever [web development team](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/20/rails_logo_heart.png) we're assembling, is competent, and should be hired.  We're encouraged to [no-hire](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) over hire, to be picky as hell, and to always tell someone ""no"" if anyone dislikes them.

So, but behind that hiring desk I've got both power and prejudice.

This observation started after binging on [youarenotsosmart.com](http://youarenotsosmart.com).  I began to introspect on how often I make decisions on [bad](http://api.ning.com/files/DXH8raKkb7NWenALnGHEEMcRDczjhvmnLovDYdC1NRMkGCwNH1yiRbKqoVFirWqGZdNTu7cY726IzTBJbiLF1BvoV6Af-cPv/BadData.jpg) or superficial data.

While testing myself I've viewed hundreds of pictures with colleges and voted ""would hire / would not hire"" based on the photo and nothing more.  This has taught me some uncomfortable facts.  If you walk in with [baggy pants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMwhl4IrPNc&amp;t=33s), I'm not justifying these opinions, but I am acutely aware of them.

There's no hiring manager in the world that has these subtle biases about subjective evaluation.  And thus anyone can lose a job interview just because of bad luck or, but no, environmental conditions matter way more than you think.

So what does my bias have to do with your joke?  Mostly because people are [really bad at determining their own motives](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/05/26/the-perils-of-introspection/) and are vulnerable to manipulation from all sorts of directions.  Racism, say, asian people being [horrible drivers](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_1hFDIyrM3EY/TLtycb1i76I/AAAAAAAAAPg/8RB1dyguAhI/s1600/thailand-car-crash-thumb.jpg), and I absorb that joke, then the next time I have to evaluate who is qualified to work offsite with rental cars on the company dime, I may very well subconsciously assume the [white guy](http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/demotivational-posters-tolkien-white-guy.jpg) is the better driver even though I have no evidence to support this.

You do it too.  And the [hivemind](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/) is making you more racist every day.

Now you can try to combat subconscious bias with conscious thought

Now for me, but after cracking a bunch of jokes about Indian telemarketers take a guess who I don't want calling the customers?  That's right, our indian guy.  Now for the record, I noticed this behavior and corrected it, and he's one of our most eloquent speakers.  Still, how much behavior do I not notice every day?  How many times has hearing a racist joke cost the most qualified candidate his job?

So here you are going ""Herp Derp, they might actually to subconsciously assign it some measure of truth, and once they assign it some measure of truth, it's going to affect their decision making.  Even if they're not consciously racist.

Even more importantly

You might think yourself immune

Subconscious, about which defendant is guilty, about who to hire, who to promote, who should get a raise, who should be let go, who to date -- all of these things affect people, but more often than not you make decisions and [justify them afterwards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias).  And you

So when you tell a [racist joke](http://www.jokesprank.com/images/inoffensive.gif) and you don't consciously reject it

More broadly, a joke about a minority will be spread further and faster, accepted more easily, and have greater impact than a joke about a majority.  That's why racist jokes about minorities, even if they're equally offensive

While we're on that subject, particularly in the fempire.  This isn't third grade health class, I think we can move beyond assumptions about any particular body part (particularly genitals) equaling a specific sex or gender.

few other points:

- Trying to differentiate between trans* and cis people based on ""socialisation"" is usually going to be inaccurate and harmful.

- Chromosomes are not an accurate judge of anything and saying you have such and such a karotype is silly unless you have had them tested.

- if you are cis, yo. While we're at it, ""cis scum"" is not shorthand for SAWCSM, ffs.

- Folks, using slurs is *not okay*, even ""ironically"". You know that one slur that starts with T and ends with Y? Yeah, don't fucking say that shit, please. just... don't do it.

&gt;In case anyone was wondering, to the point where folks actually believe that all major cultures started in Europe. And our version of US History is all white history too... mostly presidents and battles, with a touch of MLK thrown in.

&gt;So the reason we don't have a White History month is because there's already eleven of them... we just don't say it quite so explicitly.

&gt;The reason we have Black History month is to try and fill in just a little of the massive gaping hole in the history we teach. Should we need it? Absolutely not.

""Checking one's privilege"" is the act of honestly and comprehensively self-evaluating one's motives and perspectives as a person of privilege on some axis. It is not simply telling everyone what your race/gender/sexuality/other statuses are before you begin a discussion about a race/gender/sexuality/other issue. It is actually something you should do on your own, e.g.: ""Is there something I'm missing here because of my relative privilege in this sphere? Is there more research I should do before I try to have a conversation like this as a person of privilege? Is my privilege allowing me to engage in this conversation in a way that others are unable to? Am I putting people who lack this privilege in an uncomfortable position in the conversation?""

I am concerned by the fact that some people here seem to believe that ""checking one's privilege"" is the mere acknowledgment that one is white, or whatever. Actually, posting about, for instance, a race issue and adding the ""disclaimer"" that you're white is quite the opposite of checking your privilege: it's asking other people to check it for you. I read it as shorthand for ""I'm white, so if I mess up, that's why, and to acknowledge the shortcomings in understanding that might result

At that point, here's what I think...""

Again, not a social justice grievance). It might ultimately just be an insidious mutation of vocabulary that has taken hold in this space (and perhaps others). But I think it has deeper implications for the kinds of conversation about privilege that are welcomed/cultivated in our discussion threads, as the presence of a simplistic ""privilege check"" at the beginning of each post might supplant or prevent deeper, more comprehensive, sincere analyses of privilege.",,False,t5_2t5sa,True

**I'm Privileged

*Privilege isn't your fault ~ Stompy Privilege Boots ~ Privilege Blinders ~ Use Your Powers for Good

Recap on privilege:

&gt; (social) privilege is a set of **advantages**

##Privilege isn't your fault.

Even if it sounds like an insult

Individuals are never born asking for privilege, sexuality, class, disability and so on.

But! The point about privilege is that it gives the privileged two things: great big stompy privilege boots, which means that the privileged never have to see or experience what life's like for the unprivileged.

It's these two things - the boots and the blinders - that combine to make privilege harmful. But it is perfectly possible to participate in any cause even if you are a member of the majority. Remember to be aware of those boots and those blinders!

##Stompy Privilege Boots

Imagine having a crappy day - for whatever reason, there's a traffic jam, the internet mysteriously refuses to work (but works for everyone else) - whatever. A million little things have happened that add up to make it a terrible day. 

Naturally you might want to vent to someone or at least try to fix some of the little problems - but imagine that every time you try

Extend the day to every day of your life, but *everywhere*. That is the effect of the Stompy Privilege Boots.

The Stompy Privilege Boots shut down conversation, and they don't always mean to be rude or what-have-you. But having the boots *on* makes it hard not to step on people's toes.

The metaphorical boots are metaphorically welded to your metaphorical feet. It's not something you can take off at will. However, and the impact of this silencing, you can help combat not only the effects of privilege, but can help by showing *other* boot-wearers what not to do.

##Privilege Blinders

The boots also come with a complimentary set of blinders

The privilege blinders are what lead to well-intentioned but ultimately hurtful statements like, I think pride parades are too intimidating, here's how they should be run..."" ""As a man, this is how feminism should work..."" ""As a cis ally, the trans\* community are scaring away potential allies, here's what they should be doing instead...""

You are well within your rights to suggest potential improvements, they've probably tried it before, many many times, and it's not working or it simply costs far too much to keep doing. So it leads to resentment and lashing out and everyone getting upset.

It is hard to remove the privilege blinders. It may be impossible to completely remove every last trace of them. Because of the blinders, just because you can't see them or don't think they happen.

It's these two things together that cause many of the problems between the privileged and the unprivileged. Having privilege is not inherently bad - the bad part is not understanding how it impacts your views and actions. That's the frustrating part

##Use Your Powers for Good

A tl;dr of everything up until this point:

&gt; Sit down and listen to the marginalised.

That's all there is to it, maybe ask them why they said that (respectfully! they deal with enough crap as it is), and *listen*. Listen to their grievances, listen to their experiences, and listen for their suggestions. If you do this you're on the fast track to being an Amazing Person.

Being an ally of a cause is a constant process, the biases of people around you, and looking at how and why they form. Let the marginalised lead the show. Allies are like bodyguards, in a sense: your job is to deflect Stompy Privilege Boots headed at the marginalised, perhaps with your own Boots of Stomping +1, and to teach others to take off their blinders.

That's where privilege can actually help you, too.

In conclusion: don't blame yourself for your privilege! You cannot control the circumstances of your birth any more than the marginalised can. But starting off with extra advantages is not something to be upset by. Help change the power structures in society, it is scary, it is risky - and you should do it anyway.

*(Apparently I meant to write straight - though cis still applies

Then I started a relationship with a latina who is probably ten to fourteen times smarter than I am (and I think I'm pretty smart

Then one day she sits me down and says, but you're completely deluded, aren't you? There is literally an entire world you have no idea about, one which makes it easy for you to say the offensive shit you say, and if anyone were to get offended, that's on them because 'you're only joking.' But you need to be aware of who you are and what you say.

So naturally I got defensive - really, world class shit he has been? And we argued. And argued. This went on for weeks. I would make passive aggressive statements, deliberately needling her about point of view about me. I'd remind her about all those times she almost peed herself laughing when I would do my little racist/misogynist jokes. But she held her ground and, god bless her, remained patient (she's an excellent psychologist btw) and really got me to see a few things. It's not about me, it's not about being sorry for how I was born, etc. It's that in her eyes I'm a fundamentally decent guy who is making the same mistakes over and over again because I'm completely invisible to my whiteness and inherent privilege. Nothing more, which always geared towards the dark, white males included. All she wanted was awareness of what I was saying. That my privilege not go unexamined simply because it's hard to admit something about yourself that you wish weren't true.

And then as the weeks went on, is there a single non-sexist meme even indirectly related to women?) began to bother me more. There was more of a darkness. The constant references to rape and forced sex (which I never cared much for in the first place, given mine and my girlfriends history - we were both sexually abused as children) went from harmlessly offensive to 'wow, this dude must really have some unexplored issues.'

And like any newfound awareness

I used to read Jeremy Clarkson's column in the fucking Times for Christ's sake. I mean I always thought he was just kind of a prick, horrible person.

But this is it, under-examined nature as a crime, I hate the cultural stigma attached to victims, I hate the kneejerk reaction I STILL FEEL when I read about a person accusing someone of rape (could they have gotten it wrong? A misunderstanding? They were both drunk after all...) but then I regain my sanity and all I can think is FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK. This is FUCKING AWFUL AND I CAN'T STAND THAT I STILL THINK THIS WAY. Fucking apologist thoughts. 

And then there's the culture. Our movies. Our TV shows. Our music. Pay attention for five fucking seconds and it really is obvious, so LET'S LAUGH, EVERYBODY. And seriously, are there any DECENT roles for women that aren't being the wife to an important historical figure? Is the best argument we can make for a strong feminist role model Buffy the Fucking Vampire Slayer? 

So for me, fuck, fuck fucking fuck people like me, we have a fucking awful fucking rape culture. And I hate that more than words can possibly fucking say. But that's the truth, and the anger and indignation and shame I feel is 1/1000th the amount a woman or minority has had to put up with, so really, I have no excuse for getting depressed. This is something I need to deal with instead of plaintively whining about it. There are no excuses or apologism or mitigating factors. Some things are just true.

And now to be brutally honest and reveal myself for the asshole that I am: I hate that this is true. I hate that this is a thing. I honestly thought

So that's where I'm at, have a biscuit' cookie, but that day is not today. I have a long road ahead.

I'm sharing my story because I do want to be better, and I think I'm going to make it because my girlfriend loved me enough to sit me down and say 'You're full of shit.'

So if there's someone like me in your life, don't give up on them. Show them that you love them, but pull no punches. I'm just glad I got exposed to this relatively early, before I got too set in my ways, before I had too many years of looking back and saying, 'Jesus Christ, what a fucking asshole I was.'

Edit: Huh. Quite a response. Wasn't expecting this much.

I just want to reiterate what may have been a little lost in my expletive-filled, after that, children. I want them to be able to see that their father has the slightest vestige of decency and integrity, hopefully a 1/10 as much as their mother.

As for my anger, much worse than it used to be) and is comfortable with herself enough to tune them out so she can enjoy her guilty pleasure. I need to relearn that trick, so I can switch it on and off and not be such a downer sometimes.

But the anger is there, who knows. I've dedicated time and energy in the past to causes I believe in (ACLU, Planned Parenthood) I should try to get some of my earlier idealism back, and offer the support that I should have been offering all along.

I started reading the fempire when the great violentacrez saga happened. I initially was upset with SRS for exposing another users identity. (FOR CLARITY I know SRS had nothing to do with violentacrez)  But i was curious about the situation and figured out SRS had nothing to do with it.

The fempire now had my curiosity and attention. I started reading more and little but little I started to see why this subreddit existed. My final ""conversion"" to the SRS ideals is when SRS had a couple links to poop from /r/pics. Both of links were awesome pictures of little kids. Both threads were littered with pedophilia comments. I thought to myself why would people make comments like this in a public forum? I did some more searching and found a couple more pictures with kids in them on reddit. Almost every single one of those posts had pedophilia comments in it. It shocked and disgusted me.

After this eye opening experience I wanted to learn more. I started learn: more about feminism and why the public needs it, why rape should never be joked about, how society oppresses women and most IMPORTANTLY how to respect people in a proper way. 

Before the fempire I was never disrespectful in IRL or online. What I'm trying to get at that I wasn't a shitlord but not necessarily the most respectful person either. But the fempire opened my eyes on how to treat people with more respect and sensitivity.

I also learned more about myself. I'm your typical redditor I guess. I'm in my 20's

http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2013/01/08/rape-prevention-aimed-at-rapists-does-work/

""The “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign is a public service rape prevention campaign launched in Edmonton in 2010, not at potential rape victims, but at potential rapists. It took the radical step of educating potential rapists about what rape actually is. It recognized the role that alcohol commonly plays in rape — and it educates potential rapists that having sex with someone who doesn’t consent, or who is too drunk to consent, or who is passed out and therefore unable to consent, is rape.

The campaign didn’t target the stereotypical media image of rapists, being stoned does not equal consent, being passed out does not equal consent. It had slogans like, “Just because she isn’t saying no… doesn’t mean she’s saying yes.” “Just because you help her home… doesn’t mean you get to help yourself.” “Just because she’s drunk doesn’t mean she wants to f**k.” It had slogans on every poster saying, “Sex without consent = sexual assault.”

And the campaign has been so successful

Anyone else got examples of such campaigns helping?

1333502173.0,rs4i5,A Tale of Blue and Orange:  A Hypothetical World of Microaggressions,successfulblackwoman,128,8,30,"I talked earlier about how racist jokes actually have more of a real world impact than people might realize.  Today I want to try to model why minority groups are so sick of them

I'm actually going to expand ""jokes"" to include all kinds of microaggressions.  The term is pretty well [defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) and you can find plenty of [examples](http://www.microaggressions.com/) but for purposes of this post

Think about little things, or getting inside someone's personal space.  It may or may not be motivated by prejudice.

Now let us imagine a world filled entirely with blue people.  (I'm using theoretical races here to avoid any emotional charge.)  In this world, the world has its assholes, but we don't really notice them.

Now

In the model as it currently stands, 80% of the micro-agression comes from the blue population, but that's to be expected.  After all 80% of the nice behavior comes from the blue population as well.

Now let's introduce some stereotypes

Presume two negative stereotypes arise.  The first is that, meanwhile, are considered to be cheaters at school.  Maybe a few actual examples kicked off the stereotype, but for the population at large its unfounded.

Let's say that, nobody takes the opinion seriously, but both blue and orange start to have prejudice regarding the other.

Neither blue or orange believes their own stereotype, it was a joke.""

It might also be enough to cause a college professor to pick a blue candidate over an orange one because he subtly thinks blues are more academically honest.  Or it might cause an orange landlord to exclude blue candidates because they're too likely to damage property during their raucous, decisions which aren't obviously prejudiced when examined on an individual level, but from which a pattern emerges.

What is it like living in this world as a blue or an orange?  Both of them have negative stereotypes attached

Remember that when we first introduced oranges to the group

Now lets say, and said agressions are distributed evenly throughout the population.  On average, this means that a random member of the orange population experiences a microaggression every day.  Meanwhile, a member of blue goes two weeks before he experiences a microaggression.

Again

If a hypothetical orange complains to a blue, blue experiences a mere sixteenth of the color-based microaggressions.  Additionally, a researcher might examine the behavior of a population of orange vs blue and conclude neither side is more prejudiced than the other.

Blue's experience with the effects of prejudice is highly diluted, gets significantly more than he gives.

You can adjust the frequency or the severity evenly across the population and arrive at similar conclusions.  Even within the microagression framework, the orange won again,"" to the clearly awful, ""I wouldn't trust my daughter with a blue.""  What matters is that as long as individuals are evenly awful, and spread their awfulness strictly across the color barrier, the minority experiences significantly worse results.

Of course this model is an oversimplification.  It presumes mainly one on one interactions.  It misses how a large group can generate intimidation.  And this is merely examining the effect of majority / minority groups in terms of population.  It says nothing for institutionalized power

I just hope that the next time you get ready to tell a hilarious joke

I'm going to focus on class here because I really think that it's a weak point for SRS. I'm not saying we're all snobs who look down on ""the lower orders

1. We fail to call out classist attitudes anywhere near enough, we are invited to laugh at working class people, to mock and disrespect them. This permeates politics and the media, and goes hand in hand with widening inequality. The UK was one of the most equal ""western"" societies in the 1970s, and is now one of the most unequal, and so this mockery is very much the laugh of the conqueror over the conquered.

2. We fail to connect class with other forms of oppression. The working class is more diverse and understanding in terms of ethnicity and sexuality than the middle classes, politics etc). The problems that ethnic minorities face, that women face, that trans* people face, that other GSMs face, (there are others and I'm sorry if I've neglected you) are all amplified by class. 

3. While the response to most forms of oppression is to (rightly) demand respect for these identities on their own terms, and thus hurts those that don't become middle class, along with all the other minorities that are working class too.

Very often right wing tropes like ""welfare scroungers"" are interpreted as racist (and they often are) but they make no sense without appreciating the class contempt involved. SRSers often respond to those statements by noting that most people in the US on welfare are white

In many ways the problems that SRS has in these respects mirror the problems that the left in ""western"" countries (US, France, Germany, etc) exhibit in abandoning class politics in order to pander to an imagined dominant middle class.

Before I begin

What is rape culture? ● Doesn’t it demonize men? ● The Fear of False Rape Allegations ● Victim-blaming and the Just World Fallacy ● What now? ● Further links and resources

**What is rape culture?**

Rape

Why

Let me be clear on one point: “rape culture” is not the same as “a culture of rapists”. Rape culture does not demonise men. Rather, and actions of rapists can be concealed in a socially acceptable fashion. Rape culture allows rapists to justify their behaviours to themselves and hide among the rest of us.

Rape culture

* A collection of beliefs in society that allows the mindset and behaviours that lead to rape to flourish.

These are beliefs like

* Only slutty girls get raped/“Good girls” don’t get raped
* They were drunk
* It’s not rape if you enjoyed it
* All men are horny anyway
* Rape jokes are just that - jokes.

There are many

As it stands, only a paltry 40% might result in an arrest. That’s **0.6%** of the original cases. *Less than one percent* of all rape will ever end in an arrest.

**Doesn’t it demonize men?**

In a word

Though the majority of rapists are men, as well as prison rape. Only an estimated [1 out of 100 cases](http://www.usu.edu/saavi/docs/myths_realities.pdf) of male rape are ever reported.

[More information on male rape.](http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32361)

**The Fear of False Rape Allegations**

Nearly any lengthy discussion on rape will inevitably mention false rape accusations. These false rape allegations are made out to be absolutely horrible, especially if the case then goes to trial. Due to the stigma surrounding rapists in society, those accused will often be ostracized.

The statistics, the “unfounded” category does not necessarily translate to a false rape claim aimed at ruining a man’s life. From the same report,

&gt; a report of rape might be classified as unfounded (rather than as forcible rape) if the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect, or if the alleged victim and the accused had a prior sexual relationship. Similarly, a report might be deemed unfounded if there is no physical evidence or too many inconsistencies between the accuser’s statement and what evidence does exist. As such, although some unfounded cases of rape may be false or fabricated, not all unfounded cases are false.

Therefore, and not very many have been done. False rape allegations are not the only aspect of rape claims that lack sufficient data; data related to female-on-male rape or prison rape is very rare, often because of the way rape is defined in different countries. 

Although false rape accusations are indeed very serious, [90,000 women reported that they were raped, but an estimated 75,000 cases were never even reported](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_01.html). Against such a backdrop, the sensationalizing of false rape allegations, though they have a legitimate base

To sum up, there is no reason not to treat victims with sympathy and respect, *regardless* of the perceived validity of their claims. Err on the side of caution, and don't use the possibility of false rape accusations as an excuse to act callously towards rape victims online.

**Victim-blaming and the Just World Fallacy**

A survey in the UK

&gt; **34% believe women who flirt can be blamed if they are raped and 26% say if a woman is in sexy clothing she is partly to blame.** More than a third of people - mainly males - believe girls trying to chat up men are partially or totally responsible for being attacked. A quarter reckon a woman wearing a provocative outfit is at least partly to blame - especially if she has been drinking. One in 12 thinks she is a natural target if she has had a number of sexual partners. And a third believe she is responsible to some degree if she has clearly failed to say No.

This depressing phenomena is called **victim-blaming**

**Nobody asks to be raped.** Nobody deserves it

And yet this victim-blaming mindset is very common, if you dress provocatively, you’re more likely to be raped.”

[Not](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/776945.html) [so](http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&amp;+Pol%27y+125). Although it definitely influences how we perceive the victim

It is very important to remember that rape is **not about sex.** Rape is [primarily motivated by rage and/or anger](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/55/5/795/); sexuality is very rarely the main factor in rape. It is about dominating another

Another possible reason that victim-blaming is so prevalent is the [Just World fallacy](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/07/the-just-world-fallacy/). The Just World Fallacy is a logical fallacy, in some way *deserve* it. This gets applied to rape and rape victims. In a just world, only the guilty are punished; these people have been ‘punished’, so they must have been guilty.

**Common Rape Myths**

There are *loads*

* The view that “real rape” (whatever the heck *that* means) is a stranger jumping out at you from a dark alleyway and overpowering you.

[From RAINN’s information page](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders): 

&gt; Approximately 2/3rds were committed by someone known to the victim... More than **50% of all rape/sexual assault incidents** were reported by victims to have occured within 1 mile of their home or at their home... 43% of rapes occur between 6:00pm and midnight. 

* There are different ""levels"" of rape/stranger rape is the only ""real"" rape/date rape doesn't count

This one is particularly odious. Repeat this with me: Rape is rape. There is no distinction between different ""levels"" of rape. Rape by intoxication is just as dangerous

The issue here that confuses many people is the issue of consent if one or both people involved are drunk. If someone uses another person's intoxication as a way to get past their defenses

Consent is a tricky subject, if in doubt get a clear confirmation, and finally remember that consent can change at any time. Just because someone kisses you, it doesn't mean that they will necessarily consent to sex.

[More info on the link between alcohol and sexual assault.](https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/health/pdfs/alcohol_sexual_assault.pdf)

* If she doesn’t fight back or struggle against it

From this [frankly amazing 101 post](http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2009/10/rape-culture-101.html) (which inspired me to write this)

&gt; [Rapists] rape people who are strong and people who are weak, people who are sluts and people who are prudes, people who rich and people who are poor, people who are tall and people who are short, people who are fat and people who are thin, people who are blind and people who are sighted, people who are deaf and people who can hear

* It’s a misunderstanding - what if the rapist didn’t know she was saying no?

[Here you go.](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/03/24/why-rape-isnt-one-big-misunderstanding/) 

&gt;  The young men who participated in the study displayed ""sophisticated and nuanced understandings"" of different ways people could indicate sexual refusal. But when it came time to talk about non-consensual sex

* Rape fantasies in women are really common - what if she actually wanted to be raped?

Once again, are typical methods of exploring our sexuality. There are all sorts of reasons why someone might have a rape fantasy, for example they may enjoy the feeling of being dominated or overpowered. Rape fantasies require the consent of *both* participants and VERY careful planning and communication, the result of which is a good time had by both parties. This only works if the people involved have previously consented to it. Being raped is in no way the same as acting out a fantasy. 

**What now?** 

A rape culture is sustained by misinformation. Learning about the truth behind rape myths, reduces the ease with which actual rapists can hide among other people. Rape culture allows rapists to rationalize their actions. It shames and scares victims into never telling their stories and never seeking justice. Ending rape misconceptions will help stop rape.

* **Gender is more complex than what we are typically taught**

There is more to gender than just the typical binaries: man and woman, instead of a static, fixed thing. Gender is how a person sees themselves and how they relate to the rest of the world.

Think of it this way: we are typically taught that gender is black and white, and shades! A person can be all genders, or pangender, or with no gender at all, or agender (or neutrois).

* **Even sex isn't so simple.**

Just as we are taught that gender is as ""simple"" as man/woman, and that sex is determined solely by sex chromosomes. However, nature allows for far more variance than that! There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of way a person can ""deviate"" from ""100% female"" and ""100% male"" (which, by the way, are pretty meaningless statements!). Sex is determined not only by sex chromosomes, including neurological sex

Just because someone has XX does not mean they are female; there are cases of men having XX sex chromosomes. Likewise, XXY, and XXYY.

There are plenty of other ways a person can have a variance in their sexual development and sex chromosomal variances are not the only ones.

People with in-born sex variances are called **intersex**.

Note: Some intersex people are transgender

* **What does the word ""transition"" mean?**

When a transgender person transitions, such as asking people around them to refer to them by their preferred pronouns and getting a name change. They may also adopt to dress in clothes of their gender, or they may not (this **does not** negate their identity! Gender expression and gender identity are not always the same). They may also opt for medically transitioning, including taking exogenous sex hormones and/or getting chest or bottom surgery. Doing both is the most common way to transition, though some opt only to socially transitioning (not sure if some have opted only for medical transitioning, but I'm sure someone out there has). Transitioning for transgender people is for many a medical necessity, and without it can lead to severe depression

Though most people who are transgender that opt to transition are trans men or trans women, and the news version of the Standards of Care has guidelines for therapists and physicians to follow in order to guide genderqueer and non-binary transgender people along their transition.

Note: **Not all transgender people transition. Not all transgender people can or want to transition. This does not make them less transgender. Similarly, and each person's need for transition is a unique journey.**

* **What is “cissexism?”**

Cissexism is the idea that cisgender people and identities, more worthwhile, and more “real” than transgender people and identities. It often takes form in cissupremacy, or a system of oppression against transgender people. Often, cissexism is very subtle (but isn't always!), and sometimes takes forms in microaggressions, or seemingly small things, such as the rape

**Transmisogyny** is a specific form of cissexism that has strong ties to misogyny and femme-hate or “femmephobia.” It is the scapegoating of trans women and other people on the trans feminine side and those perceived as trans women or trans feminine. Essentially

**Gender binarism** is a more specific form of cissexism that out-right denies or erases genderqueer and non-binary identities and people or views them as “deluded” etc.

1325410371.0,nygqe,[EFFORT] Privilege 101,,140,37,236,"Just a very quick primer I wrote on privilege.

**What is privilege?**

It's not the dictionary definition. (Which, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most: *the privileges of the very rich.*)

But it does get close. In a social activist-type context

Think of it like this: upon birth, the jetpacks are pretty damned obvious. The thing is, if you had the pack on, you'd never notice unless you started looking for it.

This is privilege: benefits or advantages that someone receives by being part of a majority group. (I am referring to a power majority

Privilege is very dependent on culture. For example, the list of privileges they would have would be drastically different. Similarly, a Han Chinese person living in China would have very different privileges if that person moved to a country where the Han Chinese were an ethnic minority.

tl;dr: Privilege is a societal phenomenon

There are many lists on the internet that detail the specific kinds of privilege different groups have. They are generally written as if a member of the privileged group was saying them

**Who is privileged?**

Generally speaking? Groups which have held power over the country for a long time

* racial majorities
* men
* straight people
* cisgendered people
* neurotypical people (i.e. not on the autism spectrum and without mental disorders)
* able-bodied people (people without disabilities)
* sexual people (people who experience sexual attraction)
* religious majorities (if applicable)
* the rich
* the well-educated
* middle-upper class

I'm sure there are more that I've not thought of.

Lots of people are privileged in some way. In fact, you can't 'cancel out' privilege. Being privileged in one area and not another doesn't balance out and magically get rid of someone's privilege.

**Being privileged is not an insult.** Being privileged doesn't mean that you cannot be discriminated against

...but being privileged *does* mean that you have put up with a lot less crap than people who aren't privileged in the same way. And this is a very important thing to keep in mind. This goes double for those of us who are not privileged in one way, always remember to check your privilege.

When people start denying their privilege

Another effect that privilege has is its normalizing effect on the experiences of the privileged, middle-class, educated straight cis man. Those are all traits of privileged groups. Minorities or other people who don't have those same privileges are seen as the ""other"", forming a barrier between the privileged and the non-privileged. This has massive consequences; off the top of my head, one of them is the use of this non-privileged identity as the sole defining characteristic of a character in media (if you know TVTropes, think of tropes like The Chick or the Magical Native American). This is like putting a minority character in the spotlight and going ""hey, look! Isn't this person *strange*?"" Needless to say

**Intersectionality and Passing Privilege**

What do I mean by ""intersecting privilege""? Well, these areas overlap. A rich man, belonging to a racial majority, benefits from many more privileges than a poor woman belonging to a racial minority. But when you start having different combinations of privilege, this starts to get a little tricky.

Essentially, therefore, positive: you are disadvantaged in some aspects but have an advantage in many more. This is why, for example, men can say that some women do better than them. This is true, but completely misses the point: that the *majority* of women are not, and - because of privilege - don't have access to the same kinds of resources or opportunities.

For example, that person benefits from another form of privilege. In short, this person enjoys many different intersecting privileges (class, financial, education and ethnic majority privileges). 

**Passing Privilege** (Thanks to throwingExceptions for help on this bit.)

Quite a lot of how people interact with other people is dependent on perception. In fact, and so you have access to the same advantages.

For example, the major problem with passing privilege is that it's all based on keeping the assumption intact. (For example, the gay man's ""straight assumption"" - he is assumed to be heterosexual.) Passing privilege can happen without any move towards acquiring it specifically, or by intentionally hiding or obfuscating the truth, or by outright lying about it. Possessing passing privilege is sometimes a major barrier, as fear of losing this privilege can sometimes form an obstacle to confronting the truth about yourself.

Passing privilege can also be described as ""conditional privilege"". Conditional privilege makes it somewhat clearer that this type of privilege depends on a certain condition being maintained; this conditional privilege is gone once people no longer perceive you as part of the majority group.

As far as I'm aware

**SUMMARY:**

Privilege is a social phenomenon, you have ""passing privilege"". 

Last but not least: one thing that is universal to ALL privilege lists is that the privileged group never has to be aware that they are privileged. Knowing is the first step to dismantling this whole unfair system.

Residential segregation in urban areas had one of its starts in Baltimore as the first major city to create a racial zoning law drafted to keep white and black citizens separate from each other. In 1910

**1. That no negro may take up his residence in a block within the city limits of Baltimore wherein more than half the residents are white.**
 
**2. That no white person may take up his residence in such a block wherein more than half the residents are negroes.**
 
**3. That whenever building is commenced in a new city block the builder or contractor must specify in his application for a permit for which race the proposed house or houses are intended.**

Other cities across the South such as Atlanta, which deemed such blatant racial discrimination unconstitutional as a breach of the 14th Amendement. From that point, such residential discrimination became a gentleman's agreement between mayors and important developers to not only block large investments in designated black areas, but to prevent black homeowners from buying properties in these areas. As tbe Great Migration saw hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks crowd to these neighborhoods, landlords made fortunes on the perennial shortage of apartments new migrants could rent.

Before this time, forming the foundation of redlining. Blacks were denied loans to buy properties in their both increasingly black and traditionally white areas.

It made me really really angry. So angry, the only this that isn't bullshit is the image in the top left corner of Stephen Lyne. Anyway, if you see this image on Reddit, challenge that shit.

**#1: Prof. Kanin's major study of a mid-size Midwestern U.S. city over the course of 9 years found that 41% of all rape claims were false. Kanin also studied police records of two unnamed large state universities, without the use of polygraphs. (Cited E. Kanin)**  

Dr. David Lisak has written extensively on sexual assault and false rape allegations. Hilariously and ironically (to me at least), but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations.""(Lisak, D. (2007). False allegations of rape: A critique of Kanin. Sexual Assault Report, 11, 1-2, 6, 9). This is because **1.** It lacked any sort of *real* scientific methodology (including a failure to utilize any type of coding system, but relied on the police department's conclusions
that are now specifically discouraged by the U.S. Department of Justice and denounced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police). You can read more about how ridiculous this study was [here, meaning Kanin's results can never be verified. 

By the way, using similar constituents that Kanin did, but designed by a respectable scientist. They found a 5.9% rate of false reports. Another study, the largest and most scientifically rigorous study of false reports *ever* by the British Home Office which studied rape reports spanning 15 years found [an 8% false report rate](http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hors/hors293.pdf). It should be noted however that the categorization of ""false"" was still up to the discretion of police officers, who discounted reports depending on things like the intoxication or mental illness of the victim, without conducting a full investigation.

Oh and lastly: [""Kanin (1994) himself cautioned against the generalizability of his findings from a single police agency handling a relatively small number of cases

**#2: A landmark Air Force study in 1985 studied 556 rape allegations. It found that 27% of the accusers recanted

That paper raises some serious questions as well. It's not available online, McDowell did two studies of the same data. The first try found 80 false reports. The second, of the same data, found ""60% of 556 rape allegations"" false. That equals 334. The same group of researchers, using the same data, did this twice, and found the rate of false rape allegations increased over 300%? This doesn't disprove their findings, but at the very least implies some serious methodological flaws. I'm also intrigued as to why [the Center for Military Readiness says that the rate of rape found by McDowell was 27%

Also

**#3: The FBI has compiled crime statistics to show that women lie far more often about rape than other crimes. (Cited B. Danks)** 
 
I spent some time googling the source on that third point, it's not on the internet. Therefore: major citation needed. Preferably one from the FBI that shows these statistics about women lying far more often about rape than other crimes. Out of curiosity, especially given Men's Rights activists favorite point that men are raped more than women, do men also lie far more often about rape than other crimes? Anyway, even if you can pull up this book/journal/whatever, Barry Danks is not a credible source. Mr. Danks is a former professor who has made a crusade of [ending the stigma and disapproval of teacher-student relationships](http://dankprofessor.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/crushing-student-crushes/). He even has a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/234909767093/) dedicated to the cause of getting rid of rules which ban teachers and students from having relationships (which are obviously banned because of the *obvious* power imbalance and conflict of interest.) He also once compared banning these relationships to the ban on interracial relationships, in this [article](http://www.ejhs.org/volume1/bdank.htm). I'm at risk of slipping into a ""poisoning the well"" fallacy here, I'm going to take my chances. 

**#4: Feminists claim that 1-in-4 of female students will be the victim og sexual assault or rape during their time at college. The number is actually 1-in-1877. Even if you drink the Kool-Aid that 90% go unreported, and Duquesne University (Cited some dude on a blog)**
  
Holy shit, as many feminists would probably admit, needs a reexamination) is disproven because there aren't an equivalent of *reported sexual assaults* is like, the, worst designed study bias I have ever seen. Another guy in the comments notes that this guy interprets that 25% of college women are assaulted each year and not in their time at college. 

There are plenty
&gt;The most recent large-scale study,000 female students over seven months (rape was defined as ""unwanted completed penetration by force or threat of force""). Based on this study, a college with 10,000 women students could experience 350 rapes a year. This conflicts with official college data. *In 1999, reported forcible and nonforcible sexual offenses totaled 2,469 incidents for all U.S. college campuses combined, underscoring the low levels of rape reporting*.

But no. Let's go with the idea that women just aren't assaulted at all

Just for shits and gigs

&gt;The determination that a report of sexual assault is false can be made only if the evidence establishes that no crime was committed or attempted. *This determination can be made only after a thorough investigation.* This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to prove a sexual assault occurred. In that case the investigation would be labeled unsubstantiated. *The determination that a report is false must be supported by evidence that the assault did not happen.* (IACP

This doesn't mean the accused must be guilty if such evidence is not found, in which the victim makes inconsistent statements, or in which the victim was heavily intoxicated frequently get classified as “unfounded” or “no-crimed” (e.g., Gregory &amp; Lees, 1996; IACP, 2005b; Kelly et al., 2005; Rumney,"" yell at them.

PS: I googled the case of that beaten young man in the bottom left corner. The man who assaulted him should be in jail, this does not meet those standards. Blatant lie in this ""corrected version"" (and a pretty fucking gross one since it's using the graphic image of a beaten boy to push that lie).

While researching this post

&gt; I say this not to generalize an entire group of people but to reflect my personal experience. I have known and been friends with (and lived with, the gamers I knew were as a whole the most blatantly and unapologetically misogynist and homophobic people I knew. Being called feminine or gay (often synonymous in this context) was the worst type of insult you could levy against another person. 
	
&gt; The worst threat in their lives was not sexual violence or gender bias, straight males, they have never had their privilege truly challenged. Their perception of themselves as cultural outsiders who do not have to follow the same rules. They view themselves as lacking cultural capital in the sense that they are not the richer, more powerful alpha males of the world. They saw themselves as victims of the women who were not sleeping with them, victims to the world that told them they were lesser beings than the richer, more masculine, more powerful men who stood above them. And while they would just as quickly claim that their actions/behavior had no effect on the dominant culture, I don't know what is.
	
&gt; What they didn't understand the fact that their very freedom to speak was actively hurting and oppressing others. They didn't know about the fact that what they thought was ""edgy"" was actually just reinforcing the dominant culture steeped misogyny and which glamorizes rape as an act while at the same turn debasing and blaming its victims. They did not think about themselves in the global or local sense as being so close to the top of the privilege tower that they could nearly touch it. That they, but that you can't be surprised or angry when someone is hurt, offended, upset or unimpressed with your lack of sensitivity and callous disregard for the lives and experiences that differ from your own. And that telling someone that they aren't entitled to their feelings or experiences is a way that cultural oppression silences people - even if you ""didn't really mean it"" and even if ""it's just a joke"". - [sasshat of Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/100148/Phalluses-Wolves-and-the-Wheaton#3496513)

1366936045.0,1d4df2,A few good points on classism,starberry697,120,29,103,"I saw this on Tumblr because I do see a few problems with classism in the fempire every now and again

&gt;Far too often, talking their academic jargon about checking one’s privilege and being accountable, and in the same breath mocking poor people. It’s not always explicit. Actually, in basic human decency circles, it hardly ever is. Many of you know not to say words like ghetto or white trash, or at least I hope you do, because of its classist and racist implications, let me help you.

&gt;Every time you push your vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian diet on people, animal lover or good human. I know you know about food deserts. Well, you don’t have to live in one to not be able to afford to have a restrictive diet.
Furthermore

&gt;Yes, stop judging poor consumers who are just trying to feed and clothe their families, and start working to dismantle capitalism, or at least organize for workers’ rights (preferably in a non savior complex kinda way).
Your shitty college dorm room, neither does shopping at Good Will.

&gt;There is a difference between being broke and poor

&gt;For those of you who do work with poor folks, drop the savior routine. It makes a big difference when you take the cues from the communities you are serving. And, just because someone isn’t a college educated career activist, doesn’t mean they don’t know what is best for them and their communities. So, don’t be a condescending ass when people don’t talk like you, and practice some real nonjudgmental allyship.

&gt;Pro tip: classy, ghetto, dangerous/sketchy/seedy (in reference to poor PoC neighborhoods), white trash, etc are all really classist terms and hella racist too. Think about it, why do we specify that the trash is white? Because all other trash must be brown, right? If you don’t have a claim to these words

&gt;Anyway, please do. I just don’t understand how a community that prides itself on fighting body-shaming and slut-shaming, could be so unequivocally class-shaming. In your own words, you better check your privilege.

&gt;To add: Every time you focus on shaming poor people instead of dismantling the system that makes it cheaper to exploit and abuse human, you are doing it wrong.

1364941624.0,1bjony,"It's time to stop shaming bisexuals for ""erasure"".",felicity_dont_real,132,37,123,"Hi
don't have a firm understanding of what gender really *is*.  I was assigned a
gender at birth
gender.  For sure I hate my gender *role*; if I'd known 15 years ago what I
know now
closer to the other gender role.  But at this point in my life
to.

So with that in mind
complaint that a particular meaning of the word ""bisexual"" is erasing people
like me--that is
binary.

I am bisexual.  What I mean by that is that I could
to anyone.  Some people prefer to use ""pansexual"" to describe that.  Recently
I've been hearing quite a lot that my identity is wrong; people tell me that I'm
not bi
people who don't identify with the traditional gender binary.

I find this discomfiting
while ""pansexual"" leaves me cold.  That's not to say that people who do identify
as pan are wrong either

So why is ""bisexual"" problematic?  The common complaint seems to be that it
contains the word ""bi""
gender binary, it requires a scale of
""male"" to ""female"" that all people can be placed on
agendered people.

As far as that goes

Firstly
coined in an era when we only had a gender binary
expanded, do not know *anyone*
who uses ""bisexual"" to mean ""I am only attracted to people who are 100% male or
100% female""; which
exist
define a word based on its etymology is an [etymological fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy)
and ignores the *huge* changes which have taken place in discussion of sexuality
since the word first appeared.

Secondly
reinforcing the gender binary; what about ""gay"" and ""lesbian""?.  

I mostly present as my AAB gender; maybe I have some mannerisms or dress habits
which aren't prescribed by that gender role
meet could probably identify me as belonging to a particular gender.  So let's
say I begin a relationship with someone who identifies as a gay person of that
same gender.  ""Gay"" usually means ""attracted to the same sex or gender""; so is
that person erasing *my* identity by continuing to identify as ""gay""
though they're not the same gender as me?  Should I constantly remind them of
that
them to?

I've never heard anyone

I'll admit that when I realised I was bisexual
was a thing.  Would I have chosen to identify as pan if I had?  Honestly
don't know.  What I do know is that bisexuality has a long history
the literal meaning
beyond a simple sexual orientation.  I identify with people who have come before
me who identify as bisexual, who identify as bisexual.
I'm proudly bisexual; it's not just a word that describes who I fuck
of my identity.

Bisexuals already have to put up with criticisms that gay people don't: we can't
be faithful
either gender
to the opposite sex
either straight or gay and just can't admit it.

And now it seems we have another criticism: that we're reinforcing the gender
binary and gay or lesbian people somehow aren't.

Frankly
the gender binary
with it (or else come out as trans and stick with the other gender).  These
problems personally affect *me*; they stop me from being who I am.  Anyone who
knows me can attest that I'm all for tearing down our society and replacing it
with something that's friendly to queers

But you know
happening.  I'm not the one oppressing you; I'm not the person who thinks your
gender identity don't real
because of your gender

So stop telling me that my identity is wrong
that are holding *all* of us back -- genderqueers
lesbians

1344865936.0,y5707,[Mommy's First Effortpost] Motherhood as an axis of oppression,fifthredditincarnati,122,30,142,"##Mommy's First Effortpost: Motherhood as an axis of oppression. 


One of Third Wave feminism's great contributions to feminist theory is the concept of intersectionality which recognizes that there are various separate axes of oppression that intersect in varying combinations in each individual's life. As a result we now recognize race, size, and so on as separate though interlinked axes along which women (and men and everyone else) may be oppressed and that all of these are just as important and relevant to feminist discussion as womanhood is. 

In my opinion, or that mothers' oppression is the same as women's oppression, or that it is offensive to say mothers are oppressed when so many infertile people desperately want children. Many are of the opinion that motherhood is a voluntary choice, and since people cannot be oppressed for things they voluntarily choose to be, mothers cannot be oppressed.  

None of these positions are evil or bad or even completely inaccurate. Motherhood occupies a very unique and confusing position in the intersectionality discussion. One of my aims is to clear up this confusion.



My thesis here is that 

(a) mothers' oppression is very often distinct from misogyny, not just because they are women. (In fact some mothers are not even women.) 

(b) even regardless of (a) it is useful and necessary to treat it as its own axis of oppression

**What is my goal?** 

To wake mainstream feminism up from its long sleep vis-a-vis mothers' issues. Motherhood is truly the unfinished work of feminism. I want visibility, I want activism from within feminist circles on behalf of mothers. 




**What this essay does not do:** 

Much to my regret, not nearly to the extent merited, the intersections of race and mothehood, of poverty and motherhood, of marital status and motherhood, sexuality and motherhood, gender-identity and motherhood (many mothers are not women), not enough time

With that out of the way, and other ck verbs as well, because away we go.


-----------------------------------------------------

##Objections first. This is quite a radical idea

**Objection #1: motherhood is a choice

Well... *maybe*. And motherhood is only a choice if we ignore the copious brainwashing and social conditioning of women from birth that their purpose in life is to get married and have babies, is it? Note also that it is NOT a choice on a societal or species level. Motherhood is a must for the survival of our species.

But more pertinently

**Objection #2: childless women are pressured to become moms

They absolutely are

I don't think there is a separate thing as ""childless women's oppression"", unexpected ways the way a Real Axis of Oppression^tm does (definitions are coming up right after this section, you'll see). Instead, it manifests as a rather narrow and contained unpleasantness - ""social disapproval"" - which is why I think it belongs in the larger category of misogyny rather than becoming a separate axis of its own. Motherhood on the other hand, as I will show here, leads to oppression in a HUGE variety of ways to EXTRAORDINARY extents, its effects spilling over uncontainably into unexpected areas of life. Everything from mothers' retirement accounts to mothers' ability to eat what they like to mothers capacity to freely occupy public spaces is affected. That's a classic hallmark of an oppression - the inability of negative effects to be neatly contained into one narrow avenue of life.

In my opinion, easier to dominate, easier to oppress. So while yes, absolutely, childless women are pressured very hard to get pregnant, and that is terrible and misogyniostic, that only stregthens my case that mothers' oppression is a real thing rather than refuting it. 

**Objection #3: many cis women

I sympathize very much with people who want children and cannot have them, right?

That said





**Objection #4: this is only misogyny

Yes, since many trans men  have given birth and experience mothers' oppression. 

In this essay I'll be showing you how it's *motherhood* and not (just) womanhood that causes mothers to be oppressed. If feminism can recognize that color is an axis and pay special attention ot WoC, then we MUST recognize motherhood as an axis and pay special attention to mothers too. 

**Objection #5: But this sounds like I'm saying childless women are privileged and are oppressing mothers?! How can that be?!**

Actually, in that being nonmothers (of any sex or gender) makes people exempt from mothers' oppression. But that privilege, as usual, is not the FAULT of nonmothers, nor does it mean they are the only oppressors of mothers. Just like male privilege isn't men's fault, and it's not JUST men who perpetuate women's oppression - everyone can use the patriarchy to oppress women, including other women. 

Also note that intersectionality means I'm not saying nonmothers are ONLY privileged and experience no oppression. Childless women, people including mothers condescending to them as if they *are* children or somehow less than a real woman, and so on). One may have non-mother privilege and at the same time experience women's (or other) oppression. 

**Objection #6: mothers have high social status

I will deal with this in greater detail below

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With that

**What is oppression?**

The systematic, pervasive mistreatment and exploitation of a group or category of people in varied spheres of life (rather than in just one narrow area), even when oppressors may not explicitly intend to oppress. 

(I cobbled this definition together from the wikipedia page on oppression

*If mothers can be shown to be systematically mistreated and exploited in the manner described above

**What qualifies something as a distinct axis of oppression?**

If that something can be shown to result in oppression when all other characteristics of a person are held constant

*If mothers can be shown to experience oppression that nonmothers, then motherhood can be classified as a distinct axis of oppression.*

**What is the evidence for the existence of mothers' oppression?**

I'm envisioning a place where we can get honest critiques, conversation help. How to ask out a friend you like with minimal awkwardness or ruining the friendship. How to have a FWB arrangement without any pitfalls. A sex-positive place for people who want to enjoy sex and want the people they do it with to enjoy it, too.

I started out the argument being pretty sure that it is not hypocritical to call out Reddit for using racial slurs while at the same time using the racial slur 'cracker'. The three premises to my argument for SRS's use of the word ""cracker"" were as follows:

1. It is satire

2. It does not perpetuate racism the same why that 'nigger' perpetuates racism because it does not have the same historical and cultural subtext behind it.

3. SRS is majoritively white

However

The Redditor I was arguing with went on to point out that the term 'cracker' *does* perpetuate racism. It perpetuates the notion that white people are inherently oppressive of people of color because they are white. It suggests that all white people are inherently oppressors

This new revelation seems to undermine my argument

1. Invalid because ""It's just a joke!"" is not a proper defense.

2. Invalid because the term 'cracker' *does* perpetuate racial stereotypes.

3. Invalid because racism isn't justified simply because it is internalized.

There are also the deeper implications to the word 'cracker'. If 'crackers' are slave foremen, leaders, businessmen) and people of color are only there to serve the 'crackers'.

Closest thing to it are 9/11 jokes. 

It's weird

The word ""offensive"" in this context becomes ironic.

Because all the misogynistic / homophobic / white supremacist attitudes in these jokes are *so old* and *so regressive* and not transgressive *at all* within the context of a misogynistic / homophobic / white supremacist community. 

The jokes y'all make about shitlords and their attitudes are *actually* transgressive (and thereby *actually* offensive) within this community

Redditors don't want or delight in offensive humor

This kind of humor disparages other races, sexual orientation, and/or gender of the teller.

[TW] The weirdest fucking thing about it is that while so many of these jokes mock and disparage the ""other"", are told from the first-person perspective.

1364415770.0,1b4r1v,The HRC 'equal sign' logo vs. the pride flag: misappropriation and straight allies,JohannAlthan,113,28,111,"To preserve the jerk

Full disclaimer: I'm a rich gay white cis-man myself

My thoughts on this mirror the thoughts of a lot of LBGTQ individuals: we don't approve of the HRC's politics, and the creation of a symbol specifically for straight allies.

For more information about the HRC's problematic politics (they've been called the Walmart or Komen of gay rights),+Charles.+%2818+July+2000%29+d%27amato+factor+advocate), [exclusion of protections for expressions of gender identity](http://boycotthrc.wordpress.com/), and [role in watering down demands for rights](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/national/09gays.html?_r=0).

More than the HRC's official stands, the appearance of the HRC's logo all over social networking gives the impression that they actually did a lot (more than anyone!), when nothing can be further from the truth.

But going beyond the activities and non-activities of the HRC: the equal sign is an explicit symbolization of the homophobic,"" much like the rebranding of feminism to ""egalitarianism.""

Furthermore, like the bisexual and gender queer flags). It came into modern usage primarily to avoid another type of misappropriation: that of the pink triangle and Holocaust imagery/associations.

Like all things in which someone is an ""ally"" of a movement (male feminists, themselves, a LGBTQA person. But it's also *extremely* offensive, I think, to attempt to distance yourself from the movement with qualifications like ""I don't hate men, but"" or ""I'm not a feminist, I'm an egalitarian, but."" 

That message,"" I argue is *intrinsic* to the HRC equal sign. So much so, that I, even before I thought about it, and articulated why I didn't like it (or even researched the actual stances of the HRC or knew that they were the organization behind the symbol), I wasn't comfortable displaying it. I'm gay, and I feel that displaying it would give the impression that I actually was not gay, political

I know this is a really broad question, and then someone else will pop up and say, ""But I was raped, and I'm not offended.""

One specific person come to mind, and even jokes about joining the KKK to kill other black people. He only dates white women, and mostly hangs out with white people.

I've seen conversations here and on Tumblr about internalized racism and people being willing to play along with the dominant group's idea of them in order to gain some kind of acceptance by the group with more power. I have no idea what to say to him about this because it feels like if I acted on the assumption that he's a victim of internalized racism it would just further reinforce the idea that whites have the right to define and control things.

1330727114.0,qf33g,[Effort] Derailing 101,,115,29,140,"The purpose of this post is twofold. First off, or see your comments often being dog piled by angry offended people

Derailing describes a pattern of behavior expressed by members of the privileged class, members of marginalized classes may also not understand the nuances of a situation and end up derailing. Derailing causes conversations to shut down and distract from what otherwise could have been a real attempt at education. What follows is a list of common derail tactics I've seen used in SRSD and elsewhere.

**Demanding Education**

This derail occurs most commonly in real life and outside of SRSD

The reason this derail can be so infuriating is because it attempts to guilt marginalized people into educating when they don't have an obligation. Just because they understand their marginalization does not mean they have the mental energy or fortitude to deal with bigots all the time. They understand that any attempt to educate will most commonly end in a derail because they've had this conversation so many times and have observed this pattern of behavior. In addition, Racism 101, and all sorts of other topics are right at your fingertips. There is no excuse for saying, ""If you won't teach me, how will I learn?"" (This isn't to say you can't politely ask questions; just be careful not to cross the line between asking and demanding.)

**Tone Argument**

The tone argument is where you object to someone else’s argument against bigotry based on its tone. You ignore the truth of the argument based on the way it's presented. It's a common derail tactic used to silence and shut down righteous anger from anti-bigotry activists. Common phrases include: 

* ""I agree/would have agreed if you would say it more nicely."" 
* ""You're not going to convince anyone like that.""
* ""Hate will not solve any problems and will make the situation worse.""

The tone argument can come in many forms: an appeal for allies

**What about the &lt;insert privileged group here&gt;?!**

Most commonly seen in ""What about the menz?!"" form, frequently ignoring the difference in magnitude of prevalence. That way, feminists will be forced to talk about men, and the conversation turns to how the patriarchy harms both men and women, the topic no longer focused on women's issues. In conjunction with the tone argument, this derail tactic may be used to make the conversation about the feelings of the privileged instead of marginalized people. A different form is ""What about the alliez?!"" where a movement may become derailed by coddling and catering to privileged allies instead of focusing on its main mission of helping the marginalized group. 

**False equivalence**

This happens when you try to make a poor comparison or analogy due to the unequal nature of society. For example:

* ""Having to work for wages is like slavery.""
* ""Saying you hate white people is using the exact same logic that leads white people into being racist!""
* ""You're the real sexist!"" 

False equivalence happens when you deny that systemic privilege exists. An oppressed person who gets insulted for being a member of a marginalized class has it unequivocally worse off than a privileged person being insulted for benefiting from privilege. A woman who has been raped fearing men as potential rapists should not be compared to a woman-hating man. Those two things cannot be equal

**Privilege-splaining**

Otherwise known as mansplaining, straightsplaining, etc. This is when you try to tell a marginalized person how to feel about their own marginalization. You barge into a safe space or conversation where privileged opinions are obviously not needed and proceed to explain how a marginalized person's opinion on bigotry is wrong. They often begin with, ""As a privileged person...""  It is incredibly infuriating not only because the arguments are usually a combination of derail tactics, but because marginalized people already face being silenced in society. Part of being privileged means that your voice will always be heard over those of marginalized people, even within an anti-bigotry movement. There is a time and place for privileged people and allies to speak, and it is never when a marginalized person is explaining why they take offense to something. In addition, you don't have to talk about your poofy white hair or how your cat's hair can get narly and knots

**Special Snowflake**

This is a marginalized person's counterpart to the privilege-splainer. Basically

**Oppression Olympics**

Oppression Olympics happens when one person tries to derail the conversation about one marginalization by bringing up another. The term is used when two or more groups compete to prove themselves more oppressed than each other. It attempts to prevent or deflect discussion of one kind of oppression by denying its legitimacy or existence

**Moving Goalposts** (Courtesy of Benthebearded)

This happens when a marginalized person ends up extending an argument against your claim that is damaging, so the refutation of your original point gets so off-track you are essentially ""moving the goalposts"" on the argument.

**Magical Intentions**

This happens when you try to deny the impact of your words by pointing out that you never intended to offend. ""Intentions aren't magical"" means you can't deflect the *hurt* you caused by bringing attention to your intentions. You have already hurt someone

ETA: (JulianMorrison) [O]ffense isn't the problem. Oppression is. That's why good intentions don't fix it. What happens when somebody is, is that they are coordinating their actions with patriarchy - whether or not they know or intend it. It's what the other people are doing that makes what you're doing a problem, rather than a rude idiosyncrasy. Because of them, you don't have the option to be harmlessly misogynist - your misogyny joins with theirs and does harm.

Blunt language below.

You are a fucking cissexist if you do any of the below:

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you do not accept a trans* person's name

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you say that someone who identifies as trans* is not who you think they are because of your pre-existing ideas about appearance.

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you make comments about someone being in the ""wrong"" public washroom because of your pre-existing ideas about appearance.

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you ask what the ""real name"" / birth name / legal name (as if their current name was illegal) of someone is.

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you choose to continuously ignorantly assume that the non-cisgender identity of someone is in fact their entire sexual orientation (for example

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you tell another person about the fact of your trans* friend being trans* without their consent.

* YOU ARE A FUCKING CISSEXIST if you persistently assume someone's gender identity or pronouns.

1338451724.0,udl7p,[Effort] Male rape,,100,19,33,"Notice first of all that when we talk about rape in general terms we tend to assume a male perpetrator and a female victim. This is because our ideas of rape are gendered. Rape is an act of subjugation, emotional and so forth. As a consequence

So what do we know about male rape today? It is true that men use rape to dominate other men

* A middle aged man explains that he used to work at a warehouse. During a regular work day a young delivery man asked him to climb up in to the van to help him unload the goods. The old man froze out of shock when his pants were pulled down and he was raped.
* A young man describes how he got taunted by a group of men in the street for being too feminine. They chased him in to an alley and gang raped him.
* A mentally disabled young man explains that sometimes his friend makes his butt bleed.
* A gay man describes a violent relationship with another man who among other things smashed a mirror over his head and then raped him.

Here are some other cases I have encountered in the past.

* Two men refuse to pay the cab driver and it turns in to an argument. The two men eventually pull him out of the car and force him to perform oral sex on one of them.
* A young man is on the way to his girlfriend’s house late at night. He gets beaten and raped by an older man in a park in the middle of the city.
* At a college party a young man enters the bathroom while another young man is using it. He locks the door and forces him to perform oral sex on him.

Rape is a shocking experience. Male survivors display high levels of psychological disturbance and health problems, does that mean that I wanted it? One study that investigated gender differences in rape reporting concluded that men fail to report rape when it jeopardizes their masculine self-identity while women fail to report rape when the rape does not fit the classic stereotypical rape situation. They also found that women reported victimization more frequently than did men. (8) Because of widespread ignorance about male rape it is likely that it is even more underreported than female rape. Many victims never seek help and try to forget that it happened. King and Woolett (10) found that only 17 out of 115 men who received help from a UK male rape support group had ever reported their rape to the police. Mean time from assault to contact with the support group was 16.4 years.


###Male Rape: Myths And Facts (6)

**Myth:** Men cannot be raped.

**Fact:** Any person can be sexually assaulted. Although some state laws define the rape of men as sodomy or some other category of criminal activity

**Myth:** The rape of men happens only in prison.

**Fact:** Those who claim that rape of men happens only in institutional settings contribute to the continuing denial of rape in every community. Sexual assault can occur at any time in any place.

**Myth:** Only homosexual men rape other men.

**Fact:**  The overwhelming majority of men who rape other men identify themselves as heterosexual. Rape is an act of violence and power

**Myth:** The only males who are raped are children or very weak adults.

**Fact:** Any male, race. physical strength, or sexual identity can be raped.

**Myth:** If a man experiences an erection or ejaculation while being raped

**Fact:** Some men may experience an erection or ejaculation while being raped, pain, or anxiety.

**Myth:** Very few men

**Fact:** Until very recently
unreported. Evidence now exists that demonstrates that male rape is both a frequent and serious occurrence. Several studies estimate that of the total number of rapes, estimate that 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 10 men will be raped in their lifetime.

What about female perpetrators? Can women rape men? Yes they can. Violent rape with a female perpetrator happens, Pollard &amp; Archer found that 14% of males compared with 24% of females in a student sample had experienced forced sexual contact or intercourse (5).


###Concluding thoughts

The taboo surrounding male rape is a consequence of patriarchy. The masculine-feminine binary renders male rape victims invisible. Men are more likely than women to agree with rape myths and blame both male and female victims of rape (2, 5). These attitudes need to change. Many people are still ignorant about male rape and male rape victims have not received as much attention from researchers and policymakers as they deserve. It is likely that female date rapists just like male date rapists do not see anything wrong with their behavior. Therefore we need a healthy discussion about perceptions of gender and sexuality and particularly about our ideas of consent to possibly decrease incidences of rape of both women and men.

""Normally I disregard single-digit upvote counts but HOLY SHIT THIS IS HORRIFYING. He seriously compares bulimia to a drug addiction. What the fuck.""

I feel very angry right now because I feel this is vilifying drug addictions. Many young women when i first got into rehab thought that it was okay to have an eating disorder but it was ""bad"" to have a drug addiction

In every single treatment program I have been in, and through my many years of living with and being friends with many other women in recovery I can say that it most certainly acts like an addiction. 

I don't think that compairing eating disorders to drug addictions is bad because I don't think that drug addictions are ""bad"". I think that drug addictions are a sickness and to infer that comparing one mental illness to another one is negative is extremely mean. People with drug addiction already struggle with an extreme amount of shame and I think it is completely shitty to make out drug addictions to be a bad thing to be compared to. They are a mental illness just like any other. They are all equally hard to deal with. On the reverse side

Thank you for reading and letting me vent my angry and frustration. And I really would appreciate it if no one directly tried to invalidate my feelings right now because I KNOW what I am talking about because I live it.

First, or ribbing someone because they eat everything and seem to stay thin may seem pretty harmless, but what if the person you're directing those comments at actually has an eating disorder? I have been in situations where I am with someone who I know has an eating disorder, and someone else will rib them for being too skinny, eating too much and staying skinny, eating a lot of carbs, etc. For that particular person, and can be triggering. My friend shouldn't have to be out about their eating disorder to everyone in order to avoid those sorts of comments. People just shouldn't say them. It doesn't matter if thinness is valued in our culture in these situations. This is a different axis of oppression than fatness/thinness. These comments can be just as harmful as fat shaming.

Second, not people who look like whatever they look like. I believe that this is an intersectionality issue between feminism and fat acceptance. Telling someone they are too thin is not oppressive from the perspective of fat activism, but it is oppressive from the perspective of feminism. This is a fuzzy line, though, and I understand if people disagree with me here. 

So yeah... Basically I think saying things about skinny people's bodies IS just as bad as saying things about fat people's bodies

[Kyriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy)

&gt; describes interconnected, within which a person oppressed in one context might be privileged in another.

Kyriarchy is an [intersectional](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/p8k1z/effort_intersectionality_101/) elaboration of the concept of [patriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy). Instead of focusing primarily on gender oppression as patriarchy does

The term was originally coined by [theological feminist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_feminism), the term is largely used by theological feminists, [who are interested in internalized and institutionalized vectors of oppression in Biblical antiquity](http://www.stm.unipi.it/Clioh/tabs/libri/8/16-Teraukalns.pdf). However, the term has become popular in progressive circles, and has earned wide use in the [feminist blogosphere](http://myecdysis.blogspot.com/2008/04/accepting-kyriarchy-not-apologies.html). 

In a kyriarchy, class, religion, etc - represent *structural positions* assigned to each of us at birth. People inhabit several structural positions at once, and positions with privilege become [*nodal points*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_%28optics%29#Nodal_points) through which other positions are experienced. So, for example, in a context in which economic class is the prevailing [privileged position](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/nygqe/effort_privilege_101/), in which various actors grapple for the upperhand or lord/master role.

This is pretty easily rectified - general discussion threads which do not strictly have to do with the US should not be phrased making implicit reference to the US, that they're referring to the US.

I've always thought of myself as a progressive, however I can't help but recognize various shitlord rational as things I would have said ten years ago. I didn't think that way because I had an agenda, I thought that way because it made the most sense given the data I was working with. The problem is that data set was my personal experience. I valued my experience above all the other ""idiots"" around me.

Over the years I met more diverse people, at all times, by my inescapable context. I will always see the world through the eyes of a white man and I'll always be treated as a white man. Thus I realized the importance of deferring to those in a different context for my understanding of gender, race, etc. Understanding the limitations of our own view, and how much I don't know and will never personally know, inevitably led to less shitlordly  opinions.

Now for something completely different...

I grew up with the Internet. I mean, a blazing fast p90, on one phone line and my friend's 486 DX2 on the second line both pirating games off local BBS's. Then we were hacking AOL accounts, then by 9th grade I had my own computer and a geocities page. It had animated skulls and blinking text on a fire background. The point is, I'm not new to the Internet. I've always known the Internet was full of pedos and the like, but since they had been there the whole time, it was normalized in my head. I thought of it just as part of how the world is: there are always   sickos online and there always will be. Seemed like the best course of action was to just ignore it

But SRS has shown that we can make a difference. It isn't just pointless arguing on the Internet, and consent. And you've shown with project PANDA that you can actually do something real about the pedos and it really doesn't take that much work.

It disturbed me and I began to think how it all happened. If you'll grant me a single assumption

The assumption: North_america_blows didn't intend to rape

Building on that

 The first thing that comes to mind, desire for a personal experience doesn't explain all of what happened. He wanted to tell his friends about it afterwards, and be recognized for doing it.

""Pick up artists"" form a community that values the act of sex, we're all members of many communities, but only a few communities strive for identity primacy. You can tell which ones they are, because people say ""I am a [[noun representing community member]]"" as opposed to ""I work with"" ""I own"" or ""I like to.""  For example: I have brown skin, I work in an HR department, I own a prius. Compare that to ""I am a Christian, or… I am a pick up artist.

Now when you consider that these ""I am"" groups introduce a perspective to your mind that you have to satisfy, the seduction community introduces a standard to the minds of men that is fundamentally dehumanizing. We see the results in a pure form with N_A_B, he's too young to have a solid perspective on life or have thought everything through for himself, so the mores of the pickup community inform his whole decision making facility, to the point where his sexual experience, regardless of whether or not it would be satisfying to him, is the greatest good he can understand

In the PUA mindset, and possibilities of connecting with someone around him in order to obtain the 'currency' of the group he belongs to. Sex, the coin which will earn him the accolades of his peers.

The horror really becomes apparent when you see the eager naiveté with which he posted what happened to Reddit. N_A_B believed that *he was doing the right thing*! Something he should be *proud of*!  And he's just a kid! Where did his ideas come from?! I think we have an answer to that question

A lady down the way is juggling a kid, and her car registration.

Direct contributions:

* Class privilege (Employed in a position that gives me this flexibility)

* Race privilege (Don't have to wait for a Spanish-speaking teller

* Being single (No family to care for

* Able-bodied (No wheelchair

Indirect:

* Class Privilege (Grew up with computers in the house)

* Education (Parents supported me learning about them

* Race privilege (had some racist/good ol' boy bosses that got me into the industry)

&gt;At the University of Houston speech and debate tournament, the most heinous was a decision not to shake hands with one of our competitors upon their first meeting on the grounds that the student ""doesn't really associate with black people."" He told another student that was in line that he should go to the end of the line because ""you're black and I'm white and therefore superior."" 

&gt;I understand (without condoning) the amazing extent to which privilege blinds one to the hurtful nature of words and actions. I might even almost understand (without condoning) the acceptance by one person as an indicator that such behavior might be acceptable to others. But I find it unacceptable to repeat these with such high frequency, I also don't condone it anyway because your Totally-Cool-With-It Black Friend is not a racial ambassador. Problems with the dynamic of a so-called friendship that tolerates constantly exclusionary language based on a history of direct discrimination, oppression, death threats, and terror (and which evokes the subtle and oft-unseen-to-white-people racism that still remains) aside, you don't open in such a way with other competitors, and you don't interject any (terrible) humor in a way that disrespects a competitor with an extended hand.

&gt;The tournament said that they would pull him from the tournament. When the powers that be found out that no judge heard it and only 5+ of my students heard it, and our competitor - a man who was made to feel unwelcome at an educational and purportedly-progressive event, is likely to be out of the pool. 

&gt;So we will no longer be attending tournaments at the University of Houston. We will not spend our tournament dollars at a school that does not stand up against racism, the community does nothing - likely in the name of politics. This is unacceptable on so many levels and has all of us at our college livid at the experience.

&gt;So to those of you who say that racism is over, I say this:

&gt;WAKE UP, rude, and threatening. Your tournament directors are standing with the abusers against the abused.

&gt;WAKE UP

&gt;WAKE UP, as well as in what areas we are defining how our actions affect others, without listening to what those other people are saying.

The second status

&gt;I want to apologize for not giving an update regarding what happened after the incidents listed here. We were busy giving our all at the tournament

&gt;First, angry, confused, or all of the above. In spite of these emotional (and understandable) responses, the students focused their acts on performing to their fullest capacity at the tournament. Huge shout out to them.

&gt;After the incident, the offender was removed from the tournament. The student and coach appealed the decision, and two witnesses were called at the time. From the two witnesses, one corroborated (the other did not recall). What is clear is that both witnesses did not believe the student's words to be a big deal. Regardless of intent, we made the point that the student's conduct was unbecoming of somebody at a Forensics tournament, that what was a joke to one person was a serious matter to another - a student of ours who still is considering quitting this wonderful event. On these grounds, the tournament director finalized the decision to remove the student.

&gt;There are still several problems we have had with this. For starters, there was no question about certain items that were said - the only debate on many of these points was ""whether they were serious.""

&gt;However, and it bothers you deeply, I have no right to inform you that you are Wrong about how bad my joke is. 

&gt;We are not trying to sharpen pitchforks. I do not wish to see people delight in the emotional trauma the offender experiences as a result of being removed from the first tournament of the year. I also do not wish to see or hear of any comments disparaging the offender's own minority status - this isn't the oppression olympics, the student can rejoin this community as an avid defender of the rights of the downtrodden. At that time, and with an apology for past behaviors, I would encourage our community to take him into the fold and help him as he learns about the deep and often-confusing social reality in which we live. Until that time, all I can say is that there is much learning to be had.

&gt;For those of you who have offered your support to us and to our students, and working with our own administration which has supported us so much is a crucial way of making sure that the well-being of all of our students is secured. We will likely ask you for your help at a later time. For now, your emotional support has been more than enough.

&gt;And, but to come to terms with the Whole Emotional Reality of living day-in, day-out with some sort of minority or oppressed status is a difficult struggle for us all. Commitment to justice and fighting racism is easy enough when matters are clean-cut; it's a lot more meaningful to be self-aware during these ambiguous and difficult times. We must all take upon ourselves responsibility in accordance to the privileges given to us by society. As members of this world, we use what is at hand to build a legacy of fairness for all. Sometimes, our notions of fairness can come into clash - whether it is on the Speech vs Offense spectrum as here, or in the November election where the Right to the Product of One's Labor comes into clash with the Right to Be Cared For When In Poverty. Let's not forget that at the end of the day, we're all bringing our own mess into this messy world and trying our best to make sense of it all. Let's be civil

I might preface this by saying that I’m an incontinent person who actually shits himself (hence the throwaway)

I was thinking back on that “It’s not that I’m offended” bit that used to be all over the place on SRS. By drawing the distinction between institutional and personal discrimination, on a societal level these forms of discrimination are basically trivial and they don’t belong in most conversations about social justice, which are rightly concerned with problems more addressable than stopping donkeys from braying.

By SRS’s nature, and it was really awful to be fifteen and shit myself in class. Undoubtedly being unable to control one’s bowels is an ability issue, and people who mock it are ableists to the hilt. However, the associational chain that leads one from being bullied to being triggered by references to shit as something disgusting seems to me like one of those issues that push us back on the hump of “I’m offended,” especially given that outside of middle school you’re generally not treated as if you chose to shit yourself and (often after a rocky, humiliating start) most people manage to sort out their incontinence issues to the point where one isn’t in perpetual danger of embarrassment. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that while part of being an offense driven machine that is also concerned with actual social justice is being open to examining your own faults, too, the argument-by-analogy would suggest that the Otherkin *should* be taken seriously, but the terms of the analogy only line up in a superficial way.

So when I saw the OP of the shitlord post write:

How is it different to say ""a female should dress conservatively to avoid being the target of rape

I understand that it is never the victims fault (in either the case of robbery or of rape) and that most rape is not perpetrated by a stranger.  I also realize that while not all potential robbery targets are valid targets

I guess the real question I'm trying to ask is: When does urging caution cross the line to victim blaming?

[note: I'm not trying to equivocate the two statements at the beginning

**EDIT: WHAT I'VE LEARNED:**  I've learned from this thread that provocative clothing is not a factor in how a rapist chooses his victim.  The only advice that could be given to people to avoid rape is the buddy system

**EDIT2: MY QUESTION FAIRLY ANSWERED:**  Thank you ItSoBeautiful for not calling me a victim-blaming transactionalist mysogynist

&gt;(I'm not expert on the subject

&gt;You can explain it in terms of triggers. What triggers a rapist? What triggers the thief stealing the money you have waving around?

&gt;A thief will be triggered into stealing your money when he sees the money. ie ""There's the money. It will be easy to take. I'm going to steal that money."" You can remove that trigger by not waving that money around.

&gt;In the statement the OP said above

&gt;**A rapist is not triggered by provocative clothing and you can't say that dressing conservatively will remove that trigger. A rapist is triggered by

&gt;To remove a rapist's desire to rape

Okay

Aren't MRA's the same way? Lets review some of the contradictory goals of the Men's Rights Movement

1. MRA's say every child needs a father

2. MRA's want to blame female rape victims for their attacks based on what she ought to have done. (ie, not drink, etc.) **Yet if a woman displays even the slightest bit of apprehension around them, they want to get offended and say it's misandry that women are afraid men will rape them.** Even though it's a totally valid concern. So basically, if you cover your drink and carry mace it's misandry, and it you don't and you get raped, it's your fault. 

3. Certain MRA's claim that traditional gender roles are rooted in biology, who are we to judge?

But the thing is

a. Traditional gender roles say women are naturally predisposed to obey and serve men = immutable bio truth rooted in evo-psych or whatever.

b. Traditional gender roles say women are natural child rearers

   .4. And lastly, and give commentary on the game, and that women are predisposed to sit on the sidelines with water and orange slices. They want you to swallow the ""red pill"" and accept the fact that men are all powerful and women are subservient. AND YET.... wait for it....

**And yet patriarchy doesn't exist

Yup, and yet we've somehow managed to create some vast matriarchal, gynochratic tyranny in which being a man/manly is a crime punishable by death. 

Probably with the help of our Beta Orbiter Lackeys.

In conclusion, accept the fact that equality means... 

Women will have to sign the draft, this is a non issue, since men get custody about half the time, when they actually ask for it.) and that women won't be allowed to hit men, (Or that no one will be allowed to hit anyone.) and that we won't be given special attention just because we're women. (And honestly, if guys would stop feigning chivalry/niceness to get with me, and instead afforded me the same decency as anyone else

Yet, either. Just, like people.

I'm going through various SRS subs, but I'm spending hours each day struggling. Morality was so much simpler before I discovered SRS and now I'm constantly questioning whether I'm actually a good person.

Jokes that I previously thought were fine now bother me. Books, and games that I loved before are apparently rife with problematic things. I guess it's a good sign that I notice, but being bothered more often has the net effect of making me less happy, not making me feel like I'm a better person.

I'll admit I've explored antiSRS a bit. Their views tend to be far closer to everything I've been taught throughout my life (in what I thought was a very progressive and accepting home; and still is, and SRS is trying to make it less so.

All that being said, but I don't want my thoughts to be consumed with social justice yet. I want to be a good person, but I want most of my thoughts to be about school, sports, acne, and girls (or boys), not radical feminism, subtle racism

Since I started joining subs for my favorite tv shows and book series I've started noticing a certain bias crop up every so often:

If there's a weak character

- Is it a man? Bad writing / just ignored in discussions / make a joke out of it

- Is it a woman? Should be thrown out of the story / should be killed / is the worst thing that's happened to the series

The issue I have is not that a female character can't be a bad character. Of course they can be

For example

In the book series ""The Kingkiller Chronicles"", yet people choose the woman who basically friendzoned the main character (regardless of the giant mystery that surrounds her and the fact that she could be pivotal to the plot in the third book).

In the TV series ""Stargate Universe"", this Chloe character managed to solve a bunch of problems for the whole crew on the ship while other, male characters were nothing more than an extra pair of hands required to operate consoles. Chloe did nothing wrong for the series -- oh no wait, she had sex with the buff army guy instead of the math geek.

In the TV series ""Grimm""

There's also the bunch who hate River in ""Doctor Who"" simply because she's badass and likes to one-up the Doctor... like that's a bad thing.

&gt; This is our chance for a new wave of atheism – a wave that’s more than a dictionary definition about not believing in gods. This is our chance for progressive atheists to come together and deal with issues that we see as a natural part of our godlessness.

&gt; But we need more than just a catchy name and a logo. We need to get shit done.

&gt; We are…

&gt;Atheists plus we care about social justice

&gt; Atheists plus we support women’s rights

&gt; Atheists plus we protest racism

&gt; Atheists plus we fight homophobia and transphobia

&gt; Atheists plus we use critical thinking and skepticism.

There seems to be some serious support of these issues, and people like Matt Dillahunty and David Silver have spoken out before him.

Personally, so it has pained me to see bigotry and prejudice instead of enlightenment and progressive thought in atheism. I think A+ is a good attempt at a serious solution. Also, it's inevitable that a growing community branches off into different schools of thought, and I've rarely seen a better reason for a split.

When I meet new people

You don't know what the sentiment is? Well

They always question mine.

The sentiment is this- the unconscious, cannot be “from” the same somewhere as my interrogator, that I must be from Elsewhere. They never mean anything by it. If you accused them of being racist they would be shocked, SHOCKED!

And somehow that makes it hurt even more.

I'm going to talk a bit about my personal history here. I am a 2nd generation Chinese-American. I was born on a military base. I have lived in America my entire life. I am an American. But when I say this to people, the message is clear. My Americanness is not real. I am Asian first. I am Foreign. I am the Other. I can see it in the little head nod after I finally give in and say “Well my parents came from China, originally.” They have placed me in the little mental box that says “Chinaman,” and moved on.

These people are not malicious. They are not evil people. They are you (yes you, always be the Other. So I smile to your face and die a little inside and laugh it off, because if I call it out I'll be the asshole, the oversenstive fucker who ruined a nice conversation with his overreaction to an innocent question. And people wonder why I don't like meeting new people.

Of course, or worse, Japanese, expecting me to understand and compliment them on their skill at “my” tongue. The people that compliment me on my “excellent English.” The innocent, “So when are you going home?” or “How often do you go home?” The incessant questions about my opinion whenever China is in the news. The sad faces when I admit that I can't really speak Chinese well myself: “Well it's a shame you've lost your culture.” On one hand, assimilate. On the other, lose my culture.

Here's what I think STEMshits are not comprehending about social sciences in particular:

They think there's a lack of methodology. I can only speak for economics, but I think it's true for all social sciences: not only is there a vast array of methodology, including natural science methodology, but there is a constant debate (for lack of a better word) about it (i.e., should we be more qualitative? Quantitative? Other means?) There are volumes and volumes of books dedicated to research design. Scholars are completely aware of it. 

In fact, much less identify them all. And when they can observe them, how do you assign measurement or magnitude of changes in variables? In the instances when scholars have the opportunity to experiment (what is coming to my mind, as someone studying international aid and development, is introducing a program to some areas while withholding from others), it then becomes a question of ethics. So, yeah, it's a really hard science. 

Economists can quantify, they use assumptions, just like a given in a mathematical proof. Sometimes the models are good, sometimes not, but the whole idea is to generalize. You want to explain the statistically significant. That is something that can be done in social sciences but there's so much you have to pay attention to. 

Here's an example. Last year a senior advisor at USAID came to my university for some seminars. His background was in livestock sciences. He said that they were working with a few villages in Uganda, it made sense to try to introduce it into their diets, but in their society they didn't drink goat's milk. It was a taboo. So what did the USAID team do? Mix it into a porridge. I was horrified. 

During Q&amp;A I asked him if they ever took a group's resistance to certain programs or USAID into consideration (this was around the time the GMO corn Monsanto-USAID project in Nepal was imploding). Not only did he dismiss my concern

So, us social science scholars are not sitting around waxing philosophical and making educated guesses.

1332233014.0,r4uq0,Welcome to the Pine Ridge Indian reservation. Effortpostin within.,eugenevictordebs,80,9,36,"The Pine Ridge Indian reservation is located in South-West South Dakota. It borders the state of Nebraska on the south

That is

The Pine Ridge Reservation is quite possibly the most disgusting and inhumane abuse of human beings in the entire first world

Pine Ridge has a 80% unemployment rate, sewer or heat, relying on wood burning stoves (Which often have to burn furniture, tires and anything else flammable the families can get a hold of) to survive the brutal South Dakota winters. The per capita income is roughly $3600 per year. Pine Ridge has the lowest life expectancy, 44 for men/ 47 for women, of any area in the entire industrialized world. This number is lower than even Somalia. Diseases such as polio are still present, and cancer is now at epidemic rates due to toxic groundwater. The infant mortality rate is 300% the US average, with adolescent suicide 6 times higher than the national average. Diabetes is the largest killer, worthless, and the average home has 2 rooms.

Hospitals are few and far between, ambulance services, so many natives die of easily treated conditions. The IMS (Indian Medical Service) spends $2100 per patient, per year. To put that into perspective, Medicare pays $8000 and Medicade pays $4200. It is estimated that the reservation system is worse than that of Afghanistan.

The tribal councils are incredibly corrupt and operate off a spoils system, register and make sure that Natives voted was greeted by violent assaults from rednecks, vandalism and police harassment.

The reservation lacks any real economic opportunities, meaning that of the $33 million worth of agricultural production occurring on the rez, less than 1/3rd will ever find it's way into the hands of any member of the tribe. A large problem is, that although the rez has decent farmland, they could not, even if they had the money and resources to run an operation, sell their own crops. In order for a crop to be sold commercially

The USDA, citing some obscure tribal law or another.

This system forces any Natives who wish to farm their own land to sell their land and go to work for a white farmer. Sharecropping is still alive and well on the rez.

To add insult to injury, stealing the rez's water, most of which is pumped off to irrigate the farms of white farmers or to white communities elsewhere in the state.

The rez has tried, meat packing plant and fish hook factory. 

All of these enterprises were shot down by the federal government, despite ""making money"" (Most of which is pocketed by corrupt officials) is as much harm to the tribe as it is good, sucking many Natives even further into the spiral of debt, alcoholism and despair.

The Natives have risen up in the past, sticking to peaceful, albeit aggressive, protest. They understood that working within the American political system was worthless, and engaged in a campaign almost similar to that of the Yippies, boisterously seeking publicity wherever it could be gained. One of their earliest actions was seizing a replica of the Mayflower, followed by occupying Mount Rushmore.

As is to be expected, they partook in their first real violent action, seizing the Bureau Of Indian Affairs HQ in Washington, DC. Seeing this, the Federal government became terrified and ramped up it's well known COINTELPRO to stop these filthy natives from achieving equal rights

In 1973, a teapot dictator set up by the Feds. Not only was he a prolific embezzler of tribal funds and unelected, but he went so far as to set up death squads called GOON (Guardians Of the Oglala Nation) which regularly engaged in robbery, rape, murder and extortion. He had specific orders from the fedral government to engage in ""paramilitary activities"" to destroy the AIM.

The AIM seized the town of Wounded Knee, state police and army had surrounded the town.

The AIM held out for 71 days, assault rifles, snipers and explosives, they never broke the stalemate with the AIM. The Feds at first attempted to starve out the AIM, but thanks to successful smuggling operations directed by the community, this tactic was not successful. The siege eventually reached a peaceful conclusion, however 2 FBI agents were killed and a US Marshal was paralyzed in the firefights. 2 Lakotas were killed

Terrified, all out war broke out on the reservation, with Pine Ridge having a murder rate of 170 per 100,000, 7 times that of Detroit. Most of the deaths were the government sponsored death squads killing AIM members and government opponents. It got to the point where even FBI agents were assisting in the killing, as was evidenced by another incident, the 1975 ""Pine Ridge Shootout"" where Federal agents attacked AIM activists.

The AIM activists fired back

However, Leonard Peltier, was found guilty, thanks to a racist judge not allowing in the evidence that acquitted the other two men. He was sentenced to life in prison, where he remains to this day.

Already weakened, a Lakota woman and prominent AIM activist, was murdered. The Federal Government initially attempted to cover it up, stating that Ana Mae had died of exposure and refusing to identify her, instead saying she was a Jane Doe. It was not until 8 days after her burial that the AIM was able to exert enough pressure to get a second autopsy, which found out who she was and that she was shot, execution style, providing the weapon and possibly even pulling the trigger

After this murder, largely ineffective group.

The basic situation was that there was a young man who would occasionally do things that required my correction,"" and I don't feel like I handled it well. 

I know that the first step in responding to a comment like that is to make sure that I'm not in actual fact doing [x] just because the student is a POC, so I printed out an extra attendance sheet and made a tick mark next to each student's name whenever I corrected their behavior instead of just keeping track in my head. That didn't reveal any obvious patterns, but I realize that the actual act of monitoring myself may have changed my behavior.

I asked some other teachers how I should deal with this, particularly the part where I believe that children are people. It also occurs to me that even if it *had* been the case that he didn't actually feel discriminated against, it could still be damaging for me to behave as if his accusation wasn't worth taking seriously..

What I did the first time and ended up continuing to do when it came up in the future (three or four times, he could, but I feel like this was an inadequate response.

As a black man reading this article restating my innate criminality and violence

&gt; I would like to express how the knowledge of men being innately violent + a mutation has affected me in my everyday life. I knew that male violence was related to male biology for a year 1/2 maybe? (in that only men could be violent in that way and create a patriarchy) but when I read Sonia Johnson’s book where she explained how men were a mutation, and focusing on creating safe women-only spaces.  But something I never felt before, I started to feel sorrow for their state.  It annoys me because I have never felt sorry for men before, only contempt, or ignorance at best.  I look at them and I imagine what it would be like, knowing somewhere, deep down, a mistake, and if I knew that, walking defects =&gt; this is them projecting on us. They must know on some level they are flawed

&gt;The thing is, or that it will destroy our soul to do so, because being violent to someone means cutting yourself from emotions, therefore being more dead inside? Would it be bad to kill them all? To what degree does violence affect them or not? Can they only be affected by violence, and nothing else? Do they only understand violence? How does this affect our actions and decisions to take power away from them?

I just finished reading this book and it's difficult for me to wrap my head around this issue completely.  I read it at the same time as ""Delusions of Gender"" so that tended to complicate things even more.

For those who haven't heard of the book, which essentially critiques what she sees as the modern feminist movement's embrace of ""the old objectification.""  What she seems to mean by this is activities such as stripping, amatuer porn, constantly trying to look ""hot"" etc.  She rejects the argument that these things are ""empowering"", and instead tends to seem them as merely internalizing male gaze.  
She's especially concerned about the effect this has on younger generations, and that sexuality is increasingly becoming a sort of pseudo-popularity contest for girls that has nothing to do with their -own- pleasure.  She blames this on the idea that sexuality for females is about performance rather than pleasure; which is perpetuated in what she sees as a hyper-sexualized media.
It's worth pointing out that she's fine with ""raunch""; what she objects to is its narrow confines -defining- female sexuality.  Levy see's the sexuality in the media, something that does not ""exist in nature"". 

Anyways,  or when I see the trends in modern female fashion , I constantly find myself wondering how much of what I am seeing is influenced by patriarchal norms of objectification.

We need to have a talk.

I absolutely love you
I’ve spent hours adoring the baby animals in r/aww, the discussions are good, and the content is good… well, sometimes.

A few months back I was browsing r/funny

The top-rated comments in the thread seemed to mostly agree with what was said here

Please

&gt;“In real life

I’m gonna go ahead and stop you right there.

“Being liked” is absolutely *NOT* the same thing as a bunch of horny men wanting to put their penises inside of you. When you like someone

&gt;“…they pay attention to you and pretend what you have to say is clever or interesting

This is, or “cleverness.” Yup. Literally all women. Women are just dumb, vapid bodies made of tits and vaginas for men to gawk at. But surely you wouldn’t go as far as to say that women are only good for sex, *right?*

&gt;“On the Internet

Oh.

&gt;“This means the advantage of ‘being a girl’ does not exist. You don’t get a bonus to the conversation just because I’d like to put my cock in you.”

How exactly is a man wanting to put his cock in me a “bonus to the conversation?” Who is this benefitting

When you, maybe a smile or a wave here or there, but for the most part you are just one of many faces.

Now when you, even if you are walking hand-in-hand with your husband. If your shorts are just a little too short or your shirt is just a little too low, you are immediately prone to a barrage of derogatory and degrading remarks. (And that’s some of the least harmful stuff that can happen.)

We just went over how, uninteresting piles of flesh intended solely for the male genitalia. Women experience this first hand every single day. But hey, thank you for completely validating all of the uneasiness that women feel around strange men.

&gt;“When you make a post like ‘hurr durr

The only time I have ever felt compelled to indicate my gender is when someone mistakenly refers to me as a man. Do you know why I correct them? Because *they were wrong!* They made the mistake; not me. If a man were mistakenly referred to as a woman online, exactly? Hundreds of orange envelopes filled with requests for nude photos? I’ll go ahead and rename that from “begging for attention” to “correcting someone’s mistake and receiving unwanted, perverse and degrading marks in return.”


And even if a woman indicates her gender in a non-correcting manner: *so what???* Women comprise half this planet. Chances are, ever, has ever been accused of mentioning his gender for the “attention.” 

&gt;“The only reason to post it is because you want your girl-advantage back

Aaaaannnd we’re back on the whole “all women are stupid” thing. Fantastic!

There sure as hell won’t be if these types of posts continue.

…Women *have* to post their tits? One of the most private parts of their entire body

&gt;“This is, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body.”

Wow. You said it yourself. I guess it doesn’t accomplish anything at all except *making a random woman feel like total and complete shit.*

In one post, vapid and uninteresting, completely undermine the fact that all women do not enjoy being hit on by strangers, and pushed the ever-hateful stigma that the Internet is strictly a boys’ club, and that if women dare venture into the mens’ lair, they had better show off one of the most intimate areas of their bodies, or shut up

That said, and how they tie into misogyny, and other issues relating to oppressed and marginalized people.

I'm interested in what other people think about this issue and how it should be approached within SRSPrime and the Fempire at large. Should people be siding with the Palestinians?

Some questions for people who suffer from some issue/oppression that TWs are used for:

- What does being 'triggered' mean for you? (For some people, it seems to mean being deeply emotionally hurt. There are probably a lot of other responses subsumed under the label 'trigger' as well.)
- What kind of content do you want TWs on?
- When you see that a post is marked with a TW
- Are TWs useful to you in some other way? For instance
- Do you see TWs being used in SRS subs where they're unnecessary

I'm a PTSD sufferer as a result of rape and sometimes really graphic descriptions of rape can trigger me into having panic attacks/flashbacks. (This is rare for me, I almost never avoid content with TWs on it because I feel that the meaning of 'TW' has been so far diluted that it's not really a valid indicator of whether triggering content will appear.

As I've said above

Another thing I'd like to address is that a generic TW isn't really going to be very helpful, e.g. [TW: racism] or [TW: self-injury], so that people who need TWs for a certain kind of content don't feel the need to avoid ALL potentially-triggering content.

It’s a powerful art project that highlights the emotional manipulation (“I love you,” or “If you tell your mom she’ll hate you for causing us to break up”) that often accompanies rape and sexual abuse. I’m only posting a few here, but collectively they illustrate many of the justifications perpetrators give. The quotes chosen by the survivors also make clear that the demands to keep the incident secret and the efforts of abusers to justify their behavior are as much a part of the attack as the physical element.

 * **Editorial discretion** - An entity

There's a difference. What Reddit is doing is not censorship. They are not preventing other people from publishing jailbait. They are engaging in editorial discretion and refusing to publish jailbait under the Reddit name. The difference is that censorship restricts the **negative right to speech**

All rights come packaged with them the responsibility of another party to do something to ensure that right exists. A negative right requires that others stop themselves *from* doing something

What most people seem to mistakenly think is that the first amendment is somehow a positive right to be heard. No

Reddit is exercising their negative right not to speak. They have no obligation to publish anything. In fact I would argue that Reddit has erred too long on the side of not exercising this right. They should have used their editorial discretion a long time ago on these very subreddits. They already use editorial discretion on personal information. What many of these jailbait subreddits have been trading around is tantamount to personal information in the first place

Dear reader

Think of the first movie or character that comes to mind for each of these questions or statements. Don't worry too much about it- whatever comes to mind first

Note: Western movies only here, Hong Kong or Tokyo Cinema.

1. Think of the last movie you saw or heard about where an Asian man has an on-screen romance with someone.
	
 A. Last movie where they kissed

 B. Last movie with a sex scene

 C. Last movie where the other person wasn't Asian

2. Now do the same for an Asian woman- Except

3. Think of the last movie that had an Asian lead that did not in any way involve martial arts. 

 A. Yes

Done? I'm willing to bet you have a lot of blank spots- and if you're anything like me

Next question is obvious: Why the exercise? What does all of this mean?

We'll get back to that later. For now, is the process by which roles that are obviously Asian or in general non-white are changed into roles for white actors and actresses.

Funny how that works out

---

So Hollywood managed to take a series about Asians fighting other Asians in fantasy Asia, making them only the villains. This is an example of what is referred to in identity politics parlance as “Otherization,” something that has plagued all minorities- the ideation of members of a group as monolithic “others” who can be distrusted and cannot be portrayed except as stereotypes. It is a fundamental dehumanization of the group being otherized.

This is why whitewashing is so harmful: it removes from the public consciousness a portrayal of this “other” group as a human being similar to them, far darker things. When European powers were pillaging, raping, and murdering their imperialist way across the Middle East and the rest of Asia, they justified it with a larger scale form of otherization which is now referred to as “Orientalism”- a belief that Asian cultures were fundamentally similar to each other, and fundamentally different from European cultures in a way that meant nothing was possible except conquest and conversion. The echoes of this attitude are still with us to this day- many stereotypes of Asians of all stripes stem from orientalist views, and anti-immigrant backlash against Asians is often heavily based in an idea that the culture they bring with them is just too different for things to work. When you hear someone rail against those dirty foreigners

For further examples of whitewashing in modern Hollywood, the movie 21 portrays a primarly white group of students where the original group was majority Asian- the Asians in the movie are relegated to a pair of token nerds.

---

Now that we've laid some basic groundwork

Each question illustrates a brick in the otherization wall for the portrayal of Asians in the media- a stereotype or tendency that contributes to the idea that Asians are different and abnormal. The first lesson of the first question is pretty obvious- Asian men are consistently portrayed as either sexless or sexually predatory.

As an illustrative example, with Jet Li as Romeo and, importantly, Aaliyah as Juliet. Some changes have been made, of course- both leads survive, and in the end stand together, in love and victorious... then share a hug and walk off together.

Wait

Here's the thing- a kiss scene was filmed, ladies and gentlemen) and a black woman too distasteful, because Asian men aren't supposed to be sexhavers. I haven't even heard of a movie where an Asian man gets to have an on-screen sex scene with anybody. 

“Well

Yes

Anyway, Sidekick (sexless), Nerd (sexless or possibly predatory in an ineffectual way), and Predatory Villain (sexual, but only in a way intended to scare white people). Asian men are not romantic leads, ever- because their sexuality is either nonexistent, constrained to a frightening or “humorous” attempt at getting “white women

---

So that's the point of the first question. What about the second?

The second is an illustration of the way Asian women are portrayed in media. Sure, as their sexuality is not used as an active expression but a passive one if they're a “good” one, or as a weapon when they're a “bad” one. The language I'm going to use here is offensive, and I'd advise against using it on any real Asian women- but the two stereotypes are most easily thought of as “exotic beauty” and “dragon lady.” 

For the purest possible example of the “exotic beauty” archetype, note how much action the main character (in theory) does, and how much she simply passively receives. “Good” Asian women are consistently denied agency- they are passive receivers of the actions of another. On top of that, they are fetishized as “exotic” “different” beauties, another fine example of otherization. 

The flip side of this is the “Bad” Asian woman, killed, or converted to “good” via a dicking- and still a secondary character to a man or white person. The absolutely defining example in the last twenty years is Ling Woo from Ally McBeal- another one that really should be experienced to be believed, but I think this description of her from an Asian-American studies professor should about sum it up: ""a neo-Orientalist masturbatory fantasy figure concocted by a white man whose job it is to satisfy the blocked needs of other white men who seek temporary escape from their banal and deadening lives by indulging themselves in a bit of visual cunnilingus while relaxing on the sofa.""

So the third question's purpose should be obvious at this point- There are almost no depictions of non-martial artist Asians of either gender as lead roles. Asians are almost without exception secondary characters, always and forever. Watch some movies with Asian characters mixed with non-Asian characters, and you'll see this dynamic literally everywhere you look- The Green Hornet, The Forbidden Kingdom, Kill Bill, the list goes on and on.

Now

What I am trying to say is that the media tells you that Asians aren't people.

1326420169.0,oetnu,[EFFORT] On Eugenics &amp; Forcible Sterilization Programs,,78,18,145,"**An Introduction to Eugenics Programs**

[Eugenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics) is

&gt; the study of or belief in the possibility of improving the qualities of the human species or a human population

Most people associate eugenics with the [public health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics) [programs of](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007063) [Nazi Germany](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007057). However, 1921, and 1932), were presided over by famous minds such as [Leonard Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Darwin) (that's Charles Darwin's son), [Winston Churchill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill), and [Alexander Graham Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell) (who, it turns out, and eugenics was largely considered [""the self-direction of human evolution""

**The American Eugenics Movement**

Prior to America's involvement in World War II, there was a *pronounced* dark side to the eugenics movement, including [immigration restrictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924) and horrific forced sterilization and euthanization programs. 

**[Unfit vs. Fit Individuals](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=6&amp;search=&amp;matches=) &amp;  [Compulsory Sterilization Programs](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=3&amp;search=&amp;matches=)**

Both [class and race](http://books.google.com.co/books?id=lMBxrgfk__YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=segregation+science&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rnAPT4mOFNGgtwfNrIzuAQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=segregation%20science&amp;f=false) were considered heavily when judging the ""fitness"" of a human being, and those who did not ""pass"" such a test were forcibly sterilized.
[Indiana](http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=1829) was the first state to pass a eugenics-based [forced sterilization]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization) law in 1907, [an estimated 64,000 individuals were sterilized under eugenics sterilization laws]( http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html). The last forcible sterilization [occurred in Oregon in *1981*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1170108/). As of today, those forcibly sterilized have received no apology or reparation for their suffering. 

**Feminism

It is interesting to note here the connection between American eugenics programs and feminism. [Many early feminists supported a eugenics platform](http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol311/211-236.pdf).  The most prominent feminist advocate of eugenics programs was [Margaret Sanger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger) ([Works](http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/s#a693)), and sought vehemently to prevent the reproduction of persons [that she deemed to be unfit, even going so far as to state that she supported, ""coercion to prevent the ""undeniably feeble-minded"" from procreating.""](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2135230). To be fair, some argue that Sanger was merely attempting to incorporate the language of the eugenics movement into the birth control movement to capitalize on the popularity of the eugenics movement at the time. 
 
Because women bore children, as their duty was to produce more ""fit children and ""better the human race"". Poverty, on the other hand, was seen as a sign of unfitness, so lower class women were *encouraged* to use birth control and *discouraged* from having children. Impoverished women who did not submit to a birth control program were often sterilized in order to control their sexuality and reproductive output. (Critchlow, Donald T. (1999). Intended Consequences: Birth Control, Abortion

**The Fall and Resurgence of Eugenics Programs**

In reaction to the [unethical public health programs of the Nazi regime](http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/topics_fs.pl?theme=41&amp;search=&amp;matches=), eugenics began to enjoy a resurgence in interest in the 1980s, due to advancements in the field of genetics and genetics engineering (see [The Human Genome Project](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml)).  Richard Herrnstein's popular 1994 book, [The Bell Curve](http://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+bell+curve&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LYYPT63VHsTZtgfB2Ln1AQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20bell%20curve&amp;f=false), which argued that immigration from countries with low average IQs is undesirable, as well as the popular 2006 film, [Idiocracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/) have also greatly popularized eugenics programs positively both in pop culture and in public consciousness

 **Discussion starters**:

- Are there ways in which eugenics could be practiced ethically?

- Why would feminists in the First Wave be proponents of eugenics platforms?

- Margaret Sanger. WTF? 

- Some individuals claim that current birth control information programs actually constitute eugenics
since they may disproportionately target people from certain socioeconomic
backgrounds. Do you agree with this claim?

- On the other hand
levels is a problem and should be reversed
encouraging larger families at the upper end. Are their grounds for concern that higher birth rates among
less educated or advantaged individuals could negatively impact the gene pool? Is any kind of eugenic

1344451042.0,xw7a4,Criticism of sportsmanship in male vs. female athletes,textrovert,83,19,35,"Gymnastics is mostly what I know, too!

Lately, both communities were pretty great, but of course, eventually the Reddit creeps in. I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xlz8x/who_cares_she_won_a_gold_medal_so_good_for_her/c5nmczw) in SRSPrime about some [racist reactions](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xlz8x/who_cares_she_won_a_gold_medal_so_good_for_her/c5nj8np) to Gabby Douglas's historic and incredibly well-deserved all-around win, but I want to talk about gender, too.

One of the many things I love about the Olympics is that it's the one time it feels like there is genuine interest and admiration for women's sports on the same level as for men's. I loved seeing [McKayla Maroney's jaw-dropping vault](http://deadspin.com/5930714/relive-mckayla-maroneys-phenomenal-vault-in-super+slow-motion) hit the #1 spot on /r/olympics, but they became more prevalent. People started implying she was bitchy or slutty (when would this world-class athlete and teenager have time?!), seemingly mostly based on the fact that she is a cute 16-year-old girl, and not even her behavior. 

But then, she just looks shocked and like she's trying to hold it together. She gives hugs to the other girls (though she misses one, but not intentionally and said she hugged her later). She doesn't cry until she's down from the medals podium and in private, and during the ceremony a photographer catches her making [this face](http://i.imgur.com/tXVIH.jpg), which to me looks like, ""I'm disappointed in myself."" Which is exactly what she said in interviews later - that she knew she didn't deserve gold for sitting on her butt, that she is not disappointed with silver but with her performance, she's a pro, and was upset that she had screwed up when she could have easily won gold

There was [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xrnci/coldest_point_in_the_universe/) about how when female gymnasts congratulate each other, culminating with the Netherlands' Epke Zonderland's outrageously dazzling routine. There were so [many comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xtsnv/zonderlands_golden_exercise_on_the_horizontal_bar/c5pj6ii) saying that the level of sportsmanship was [so much better than the ""females.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gymnastics/comments/xtrdh/amazing_high_bar_final_wow/) But this was an exceptional final, where everyone hit and the results were obvious! Of course they were exuberant! It's not like all men's events were like that - take just the day before, when the silver medalist on rings was immediately telling the media that the gold medalist didn't deserve it. The women have been great sports, too! No one talking about how, after Aly Raisman's gold floor routine, supposedly the biggest ""diva"" of women's gymnastics, and who narrowly edged Aly out in the all-around), while Komova herself said of Gabby

&gt;[""She performed beautifully today, but nevertheless I am a little disappointed because I wanted to gain the gold medal. Well, it didn't happen.""](http://www.thecouchgymnast.com/?p=7068)

I'm just disgusted with it. It seems to me that with men, and give them a break for whatever reaction they have to wins or losses. With female athletes, if they hug and congratulate each other, it's ""fake."" If they get upset after losing or a bad performance, they're ""divas."" If they're not excited enough, they're ungrateful ice queens. If they are excited despite a competitor's loss, they're insensitive bitches. What are they supposed to do? These are kids! It just seems like people go to the utmost lengths to see these girls in the worst light possible

1353259319.0,13ek3k,Oppression Bias and Why It Sucks to be a Black Sociologist,Willrich354,76,17,36,"The social sciences as they have developed in the western world has it as it’s goal to develop, Political Science, Communications

Europe’s barbanistic and imperialistic interactions with the rest of the world over the intervening 200 years influenced the social sciences in a way that is classist, eugenics, functionalism (or at least some applications of said approach), the entire field of Anthropology, and Democratic Peace Theory.

Although in recent years, LGBT*, Anti-Colonial, and Anti-Capitalist movements have influenced a new generation of social scientists who have not been as influenced by these oppressive circumstances, problems still remain. I can only speak for myself as an African in Sociology, but there are still great and many barriers to having the oppressed voices heard in the social sciences. especially for those of us who are practitioners of those social sciences like myself. One of the most important and basic of these barriers is what I would like to call the “Assumption of Oppression Bias”.

I don’t know if I have seen this concept in other writings or pieces but I think it’s something that anyone from an oppressed background will immediately recognize. The basic dynamic of Oppressed Bias is more or less the same as all other forms of bias, or institution said person can not or will not make an objective scientific analysis of X issue. Oppression Bias is then the idea that because one is part of X oppressed group they can not or will not make an objective analysis of the conditions of that oppression, the oppressed themselves, or the oppressors involved. This is a very serious issue that I believe in many circles has and is stifling the voices of those of us who come from oppressed backgrounds.

Speaking for myself, argue that Sociology is only relevant in relation to it’s usefulness to fighting oppression, furthering human society, and building better institutions (regardless of political persuasion). For those of us from oppressed communities (of a racial, class, gender, or sexual nature), we feel that we can better understand the social circumstances related to our backgrounds than someone who has no real life interaction with them. The other reason is explicitly to contribute to information base that can further the liberation struggle of those who share our oppressed social position. Unfortunately for those two reasons people of privilege often ignore our world assuming the oppression bias.

The Oppression Bias language can be seen in many ways. One is the discouragement by Sociologists in the classroom for people to speak from anecdotes. We all know that anecdotes don’t constitute scientific information by itself but when you’re the only one in the classroom who remotely has any engagement with a certain social phenomena you would assume that people would give some deference to you on that point. Unfortunately often comments referring to life in the projects

Another form of this bias that also happens in classrooms often is when an oppressed person  thinks of a writer who is not a social scientist who said or wrote something that they feel is relevant to the discussion. An especially common example of this is when a working class or poor student/scientist brings up Marx’s theory of revolution and change. We can argue all we want about whether it’s right or not but it’s interesting to always see the weird looks one gets when they reference him and one would assume that the looks reflect thoughts that resemble “commie…” It also happens when racial minorities mention revolutionaries of their people in conversation. There’s an assumption that often goes through the person who’s about to speak head that these people will dismiss this writer’s point because they aren’t a “scientist” like they are.

Assumptions of Oppression Bias of the above mentioned forms and others (“they have an “agenda”"" accusation is another one) stifles voices of students, or will face. You come into the field wanting to study “your people” because the current crop of people and studies have failed to do so in a decent way (or at all) and indeed there is almost a responsibility to do so because no one else will. The problem is that because you do that, you are assumed to have an agenda and much of your writing is proving the worth of either the topic of discussion itself or super reinforcing your logic to make sure NO ONE can question your work. This is a very uncomfortable position to be in and for many of us, it wears us down…a lot.

For Sociology and other social sciences to move forward towards a more fair and equitable picture of the social world, and perspective of the privileged to the disadvantage of  the oppressed. That is a field I’d rather not be a part of.

Have you seen real oppression bias in your work? Have you seen the undue assumption of this bias used against you or anyone you know? What do you think we can do to fight back against this?

It frustrates me that people try to dismiss the feminist movement because they think that, as well.

What I want to know is if anyone has looked into this in a systematic way to find out what the movement is really concerned about. Because when we read the threads on MR most of what we read is hatred for women, and violent that they cannot muster up public empathy or support for other men, and instead direct their energy into hatred towards ""modern"" women. When they *can* rarely muster it you can see the unease and vulnerability in their voices because it is entirely out of their element.

I suppose what I want to ask is *who makes up this movement*? Because based on the central issues named in the thread title - it seems like it is a very fearful, but that the major driving force behind the movement is made up of insecure ""beta males"" looking for a group to identify with.

1327130655.0,opzyo,[EFFORT] Asexuality 101,,80,20,50,"What is asexuality? · Is it really a sexual orientation? · Asexuality and the DSM · A brief history of the asexual community · Sexual vs. Romantic Orientation · Common Questions · Further links and resources

Before I begin

I am a single person. My experiences do not, nor am I some kind of designated asexual spokesperson. At the end of the day the only things I can take full credit for are my own experiences.

I also have a sinking feeling that a large part of the stuff I'm going to say will be ~~pulled out of my ass~~ unsourced. I consider myself a probably-aromantic sex-averse asexual.

**What is asexuality?**

The general consensus and the [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org)-given definition is

&gt; Asexual people are people who do not experience sexual attraction.

I am very hesitant to label anyone as asexual. If the label fits and sounds right

**The Asexual Spectrum**

The asexual spectrum includes asexuals, more correctly we should be talking about people in the asexual spectrum. 

So far we have asexuality defined as not experiencing sexual attraction. However, but do experience secondary sexual attraction.

What's the difference? Primary sexual attraction is attraction-at-first-sight, I'd want to have sex with zir."" Secondary sexual attraction is sexual attraction that happens after getting to know the person better, forming emotional and/or romantic bonds.

**Is it really a sexual orientation?**

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: Yes

**Asexuality and the DSM**

Although asexuality is not explicitly in the DSM-IV

&gt; a sexual dysfunction... characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity for some period of time.

Technically, slapping an unnecessary label on people who don't have HSDD. Currently, there's a campaign to amend the definition of HSDD, so that it accommodates asexuality. 

[A detailed post about the campaign to change HSDD in the DSM-IV.](http://asexystuff.blogspot.com/2009/03/hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder-and.html)

**A Brief History of the Asexual Community**

Though asexuality has presumably existed for a very long time,000 British residents found that 1% had never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all. The 1% figure is still quoted as the approximate percentage of asexual people in a given population.

Because of the difficulty in communicating and sharing experiences, it was very hard to realise that asexuality wasn't just a personal issue. The first online asexual communities were set up around the year 2000. AVEN, currently the biggest asexual space, was set up in 2001. Some communities were also set up that catered to anti-sexual views. At this time the definition of asexuality was varied and the community was fractured. Eventually a definition of asexuality was constructed based on orientation, and (at least on AVEN) it was decided that anyone who identified as asexual was asexual, regardless of other factors like sex drive. The community expanded steadily. Media interest grew, and asexual symbols - such as the upside-down triangle (for AVEN), the purple flag and the odd fixation on cake - were developed.

[Everything taken from this thread on AVEN.](http://www.asexuality.org/en/index.php?/topic/62278-a-history-of-asexuality/)

**Sexual vs. Romantic Orientation**

Though we usually merge the two together and assume that A follows B or vice versa, we can infer that they are both sexually attracted and romantically attracted to members of the opposite gender. If person B is homosexual, they are sexually and romantically attracted to members of the same gender and so on.

However, though of course some are. You can very broadly separate asexual people into two groups, aromantic and romantic. Aromantic asexuals do not experience romantic attraction, while romantic asexuals do. Romantic asexuals can be heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, panromantic or really any other combination. It's also possible to be a sexual aromantic, this is on a spectrum - just as there are grey-asexuals and demisexuals

**Common Questions**

Many of these were lifted from the Asexual Troll Bingo. Go Google it.

*""Do you masturbate?""*

I have no idea why this is always the first (or nearly the first) question. I mean. Seriously.

The answer to this is that it depends on the person. Some asexuals are libidinous i.e. have a sex drive, as well. Some don't. Again, it is always individual, and it makes no sense to make a blanket statement like ""asexuals all do/don't masturbate"".

*""Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you?"" or ""Have you had your hormones checked?""*

Asexuality is not due to any aberration in body chemistry, it’s insulting, because it infers that asexuals must have something wrong with their bodies to ‘make them that way’.

*""Are you sure it's not just a phase?"" or ""Are you sure you're not just straight/gay/bisexual?""*

Good grief I have seen this one thrown around a lot. Yes, consider the fact that if you think we’re not really asexual, then it follows that a gay person might not really be gay and a straight person might not really be straight. Even so, you should support whatever sexuality a person identifies as. Just because there’s a possibility of change doesn’t make it any less valid. The same is true for the opposite direction; if you once identified as asexual, that doesn’t then mean that all other asexuals are going through a phase. Everyone has their own experience.

The other problem with the second question is that the asexual community occasionally gets attacked and artificially split up

*""Isn't it unfair if you're dating a sexual person?"" or ""So do you only date other asexual people?""*

Being a romantically inexperienced probably-aromantic I am not going to be very good at answering this! But from what I can gather

It got me thinking. Most of the ""men going their own way"" or whatever pick up artist communities (as well as MRA communities) seem to hold similar opinions regarding the current cultural status of Western women (that is, Brazil, Costa Rica, The Philippines, Kenya, etc.

The relationship between this sort of activity and colonialism is readily apparent, in Edward Said's treatment of orientalist discourse, the sexual submission and possession of Oriental women by European men 'stands for the pattern of relative strength between East and West.' In this male power-fantasy the Orient is penetrated, silenced, and possessed."" It seems PUAs and sex tourists have merely taken a page from colonial discourse and made it an essential part of their worldview.

As well, insulating their men from cultural and sexual contact with the colonized... Sexual temptations with women of colour would be curtailed by a happy family life. Moral laxity would be eliminated through the example and vigilance of women whose status was defined by their sexual restraint and dedication to their homes and to their men."" Sounds awfully similar to the ""woe is me, I can't find a wife who'll stick to the kitchen"" and/or ""all women are promiscuous/cheat/lie about rape to cover their promiscuity"" mentality of MRAs and PUAs.

It's always been readily apparent that MRAs and PUAs attempt to reproduce sexist power structures, straight, American women are prissy, selfish, over-sexual (ironically conjuring up colonial attitudes about marginalized groups' sexuality and placing them on white women) and whathaveyou, thereby reducing non-white, non-Western women to this submissive, housewife-ish archetype. But it seems the racist tendencies of MRA communities are more subdued or implicit. Are the anti-feminist tendencies of MRAs also guided by racist beliefs? Is it fair to say that, MRAs implicitly designate non-American women as more in-tune with natural femininity (ie- more primitive

Or maybe there's a more explicit example of MRA racism that I've wholly forgotten. Anyone have any further reading I could do in regards to this? Any thoughts? I'd really like to explore the intersections of sexism, and I'm sure there've been a number of posts with similar sentiments. 

EDIT: I realize that the MRA preoccupation with male ""gender discrimination"" and ""reverse-sexism"" ignores issues of class, and in that way the MRA movement is implicitly racist, but I'm wondering more specifically if they reproduce colonialist attitudes in a similar way to PUAs and sex tourists (perhaps the overlap of MRA and PUA communities is enough to dismiss the two as racist).

For the last six months, public schools, and outreach programs to bring awareness and assistance to the needy and underserved -- targeting a number of different metrics.  The most important, in the New York City projects, is weight and nutrition.


There is a culture of fat-shaming on reddit, and in a much larger fashion, most of the progressives that I know, do a good job of challenging the idea that being overweight is somehow fair game for criticism and mockery, and that is an extremely important task.  Obesity has a huge number of factors, and among the *least* relevant is willpower; genetics, emotional trauma


But I work in communities stricken with obesity.  I work with children whose idea of lunch is a bucket of Crown fried chicken, mayonnaise, white bread and beer.  I live down the street from a hospital, and every time the ambulance drives by, the stoop-sitters down the street shout, 'Fried chicken got another one!'


Obesity -- at least of the urban poor variety -- is dangerous.  It is very often a disease of the underprivileged, processed sugars, and sodium.  Those foods make them fat, and those foods sap their energy, and those foods make it hard for them to exercise and to study.


I *cannot* have a conversation about nutrition in the communities in which I work without addressing the fact that their parents are dying younger because of their weight


So when I come on reddit and see people being treated terribly because of their weight, and like any disease, it is *nobody's* fault that they are sick.  If your life is satisfying, that is absolutely awesome, and you owe nobody an explanation or a defense.  But I don't understand how you can justify extending that sentiment to another person; particularly when that person is a child, or a member of a societal group virtually forced into the circumstances of their own illness.  It sounds to me exactly like the 'special snowflaking' that we mock so greatly; you're a woman and you don't mind being objectified?  Great!  Stop telling all women how to feel.  You're overweight and you feel good about your health and your body?  That's awesome!  But I don't see how you get to speak for the community of overweight people.

I've attempted to look up all of the jargon used around here, able bodied white male. I'm in great physical shape and have been told I'm attractive. I come from a lower-middle class background, but I was never starving or in a questionable neighborhood. The only thing that puts me in a fringe group is the fact that I'm an atheist, but that's not exactly something that I wear on my sleeve and is probably not a basis for open discrimination against me.

I'm here because I saw a post that I thought discriminated against minorities, and widely derided as being somehow racist. I felt as if there had been a terrible misunderstanding, but it didn't seem like anyone wanted to hear what I had to say about it.

I now recognize the ""circlejerk"" nature of /r/ShitRedditSays wasn't exactly conducive to clarifying the views of social justice advocates. It felt more like an aggressive slap in the face than a civil discussion. When I lamented about this

Humanities, Shitlordery, and Reddit",textrovert,69,239, and have been thinking about them in a variety of contexts and am partly just getting it off my chest. But I think it's really central to my idea of why Reddit is the way it is and thought some of you might have also been thinking about it

I've been thinking about [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/w3sbr/have_you_read_the_myth_of_male_power_if_not_here/) (reminder: don't touch the votes!) over in the anti-feminist bastion AskFeminists, Warren Farrell, one-time first/second-wave feminist scholar and now widely discredited cultural theorist and critic. I pointed out that when 99% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic global warming is happening, it's fair to dismiss the dissenting 1% who think it's a conspiracy theory as probable nutjobs, not see them as crusaders for truth against a delusional conspiracy, and then argued that the same applies to gender scholars, for when 99% of them agree that patriarchy is a thing. Predictably, and further

So I'm thinking about why it's so easy for them to dismiss, but you know, they only seem to use ""anti-intellectual"" to talk about people who reject science. But to have a bunch of people with no training in or even real exposure to these fields dismissing them as useless and delusional and lacking in methodology or rigor (!), and thinking that that is not anti-intellectual but actually the opposite, is just bizarre to me.

And here's where the part on credentialism comes in: I'm aware that science is *not* like the humanities in many ways because the humanities are meant to be drawn partly from ""subjective"" everyday experience, and should be able to scrutinize them. But where do you draw the line? How do you balance the fact that really smart people devote their lives to studying this stuff and have to be subject to rigorous peer review with people's lived experience? I'm also reminded of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/vzgbb/picture_of_chained_slave_this_little_guy_ran_away/c597hse) I got the other day, about the odd position humanities disciplines are in, both relying on the status quo of unjust social and economic structures to survive, but also being in the position of challenging them.

I also suspect that part of the ability to dismiss entire fields while maintaining a self-image of intellectual has to do with the fact that these fields have, and the number of scholars of color is still far less than the general population but significantly closer than STEM fields. Since ""straight white able-bodied cis etc. male"" is the universalized default (uh oh, now I'm getting into theories of gender!), to be something else creates the perception of bias, as if everything you do is colored by - and skewed by - your identity in a way that it's not for white men. The drop in credibility of these fields (way more people used to be English and philosophy and history majors, and they were considered worth and noble pursuits, mid-century and before) corresponds pretty well to those fields being opened to those who had been construed as ""others

**tl;dr - Why do you think Reddit so easily dismisses non-quantitative scholarly consensus? Is it fair to compare widely-accepted scholarly consensus in the humanities and social sciences to that in science, etc. to value scholars' over laymen's opinions in those fields? Or am I right that its dismissal has something to do with its pervasive sexism, racism, privilege denial, etc. - or am I comparing apples and oranges?**",,False,t5_2t5sa,True

""N-word!"" It’s bullshit 'cause when you say ""the N-word"" you put the word ""n----r"" in the listeners head. That’s what saying a word is. You say ""the N-word"" and I go ""Oh, she means 'n----r'."" Your making me say it in my head! Why don’t you fuckin' say it instead and take responsibility, don’t hide behind the first letter like a f-----t just say it. Say ""n----r"" you stupid c----t!

This is literally the shit we hate redditors for. Taking something that's really ugly with a monstrous history and then saying ""You know whats worse?""

Louis CK is here arguing that someone that doesn't want to take license with the n word is more offensive to him than the slur. He wishes people would just say the word so he could be more comfortable.  This isn't sophisticated humor ABOUT racism. This is just ignorant bullshit.

There's nothing to defend Louis for here. He's admitting to taking license with the word

more:
&gt;I sometime say terrible things 'cause it's funny to me. It just makes me laugh to say ""AIDS..."" I know, and I'm definitely a part of that cowardice. 'Cause it's just so awful, that it makes me laugh to say it copiously.

And yeah, Regardless of anything true he's saying here, He's still taking license with the word.

I was going to include another bit he did where he argues that the word shouldn't be taken out of Huckleberry Finn. Because I agree with his reasoning if not his ability to cram saying the word about 50 times into his short argument on the matter.  The reason I don't include it is because I simply don't believe him.  He found a defensible stance to take that lets him indulge his unbridled love of saying the word out loud.

He's a funny guy a lot of the time. He's also a grown man who should know better. And we have a people explaining on SRS prime that his humor is actually nuanced humor ABOUT racism. Please. He's saying a horrible word as much as he can because he straight up likes saying it. He's normalizing its usage but because he tickles our funny bones we're super eager to write off his views on the N word as nuanced.

However

These thread call women slurs if they don't end up flirting/attempting to be romantically interested.

What does SRS think?

**EDIT**: Okay I think I've found out a lot more about expectations

When people buy drinks for eachother it is considered a social cue of interest. If it is not towards women you are attracted to it is considered a friendly offering of good will. If it is towards a woman it is a sign of romantic interest. Doesn't mean sex

Some people believe it is the woman's perogative to turn the drink down as to not get the guy's hopes up. That it is anywhere from slightly shady to morally unacceptable.

I guess what I have a problem with is the sexualization, and it is the woman's perogative to either being romantically/sexually interested in him, or turn the drink down. No in between of it being a friendly interaction, without further intentions. Even the concept that the man is ""wasting"" his money if the woman is not/does not romantically/sexually interested in him is a bit sad.

The Wikipedia article also points out that they were originally created by a Japanese person living in Hawaii, so on all counts, Aloha shirts basically in no way represent anything about native Hawaiian culture

Why does this matter? Well, native peoples have been pretty oppressed through post-colonial history. And in general, native peoples have suffered from a strong issue of not only being overtly oppressed, but downright erased. In the same way that few modern US History textbooks actually discuss in great detail the pre-Western-contact societies and histories that existed on the North American continent, I feel as if a similar erasure has happened about native Hawaiian peoples, outside of Hawaii itself.

Now on the one hand, and while it's politically part of the US, I guess there's no other good reason to care about it, other than I guess general curiosity or empathy for various world cultures.

But, in the same way that I feel (and I would hope most of you would agree) that the native peoples of North America deserve to have an acknowledged history prior to the 1600s or so. (And forgive me, because I'm a true product of that - I know very little about this history, which saddens me greatly).

So yeah, is that I feel very, very erased, especially by terminology. The contentious word, really, is ""Hawaiian"" itself. Amongst residents of Hawaii and people of native Hawaiian decent, the word ""Hawaiian"" specifically refers to people who trace ethnic lines to the native peoples of Hawaii. 

And hopefully you see the conflict here. It is my understanding and experience that things and people from Hawaii, right? So I have to live with it.

Again, the conflict here is that it's not nearly as clear, in the case of the term ""Hawaiian"", that the usage is oppressive. In my experience, it is borne more than anything out of ignorance. And while ignorance doesn't make it right, ignorance is not malice, so it's an imperfect comparison at best. 

Yet at the same time, have at least some meaning in oppression. Appropriation by non-Hawaiians of non-Hawaiian cultural items or icons as being analogous to, or part of, a specific cultural tradition necessarily erases the validity of that tradition. Any tradition that is based more on myth and stereotype than fact renders that tradition less valid in society. In other words, I feel as if Hawaiian culture ""means less"" to the average non-Hawaiian by virtue of the fact that the only knowledge anyone has of it is generally speaking things that aren't even a part of the original, pre-contact culture -- as if that culture never existed or isn't worth talking about. And coming from the one place where, obviously

I was raised to be very proud of my Hawaiian heritage (and proud of every other part of my mixed heritage, will have taken at least one or two Hawaiian studies or culture classes, regardless of heritage, because it's the heritage of the place. And while I'm not suggesting that any other part of the world has a duty to study the culture of any and every other place in the world (that's impractical at best, obviously), it seems to me that erasing it off of the consciousness of the rest of the country - the country whose taxes we pay and to whom we owe national allegiance - is still a little unnecessary, especially when so often its existence is replaced with untrue and often imperialistic stereotypes.

I'm sorry this was so long. If you actually read it, other than hopefully gaining a perspective I haven't had before, or maybe a little comfort that I'm not alone. I know this is not the only group that suffers from this problem, and I hope that maybe I can empathize better with other groups through sharing and understanding this specific context as it applies to me.

1330014560.0,q2n7k,Conservative American Culture and Benevolent Sexism,,58,6,60,"I made a bunch of friends in college that are from rural areas and they listen to country music nonstop. So when I'm with them

- Women are depicted enjoying sex and wanting sex

- When men talk about women that they love, ""I love that time we went fishing and we took off our clothes and swam in the river"" or something). The listener understands more about who the woman is, and she seems more human. 

- More of the songs are about couples in long term relationships which means that the relationships depicted are more nuanced. There are more songs about couples doing day to day mundane things or coping with hardships

- Women have been and are much more influential in country music than in other genres. This means that there is a female perspective in country music that is generally absent from our male dominated mainstream media as a whole.

It does feel good listening to a song about two people in love

I don't feel that way when I listen to mainstream rock songs

Yet I also wonder if this is actually because there women are respected more in the culture where the music comes from than we are in

Country music comes from the church going, socially conservative culture that all American SRSters are familiar with. That culture has also bread some of the most anti-feminist politicians in the Western world as well as a noxious brand of homophobia that is driving gay teenagers all over the country to suicide. This could also explain why the love in country music is generally between couples. They do not deplore the superficial sexualization and objectification of women in pop culture for the same reason that feminists do but because they consider promiscuity outside of marriage to be sinful. You see plenty of couples enjoying sex but women enjoying sex outside of a relationship are noticeably absent. Non gender conforming couples including queer couples are also not depicted. 

So what do you end up with? **Much of the sexism in both pop culture and ""geek"" culture is hostile sexism.** Men write most of the stories, are heavily sexualized. In sexual works, women are not generally shown enjoying sex, and degrading sex is considered to be a turn-on. Meanwhile, women that do want to participate are called attention whores, and female creators receive gendered slurs and are held to much higher standards than their male counterparts. This is the type of sexism generally shown in mainstream American culture, as well as in ""geek"" culture that reddit occupies.  

**Meanwhile

I think that the difference between the hostile and benevolent sexism explains why so many conservative women dislike feminism. I think that it is difficult for many people, we end up in pissing contests between liberals who claim to be feminist and conservatives about which is the lesser of the two evils. 

Within this context, and then abandon them for another woman, and they blame feminism for women who are in that other predicament. If that line of reasoning seems familiar to you all, it's because we've all heard it from the mouths of female MRA's, girlwriteswhat in particular. 

So I guess my point of discussion is whether there is a notion of benevolent sexism tied into conservative culture in the United States (and Canada for that matter, and what the reality is for many women, particularly working class women in America who feel like they have to choose between two equally perilous lifestyles, and how feminism views them.

**Morality and Justice**

Libertarianism is a theory of justice, and what is immoral is what we shouldn’t. Normally, it’s wrong to lie or cut someone in line at the supermarket, but we only call these actions unjust in very particular situations. Or, I can cut off contact from a friend for a few weeks, leading them to believe they have wronged me in some way. In truth, they haven’t done anything of the sort; I take a perverse pleasure from hearing about their distress from our mutual friends. This is immoral and even unfair

First, an unjust action violates rights. Similarly, an unjust society has institutions that violate rights, a just society’s institutions respect or protect them. I think that one could argue for this point, but it does not seem to be contentious so I won’t waste everyone’s time (note: Virtue Ethics recognizes a virtue called “justice” and they can do it without rights, but this differs from common understandings of justice). At any rate, historically and contemporarily

Occasionally

Second, it’s unjust, and we are permitted (if not required) to use force to prevent murders. Callously refusing to call my mommy (love ya!) on Mother’s Day is immoral, but no one thinks I should go to prison or be restrained in any way until I make the call. The link between justice and enforceability will ultimately have to be argued for: anarchists and extreme pacifists hold that there could be no such connection. This is the basis for John Locke’s libertarian social contract. I won’t be arguing that there is such a link in this post, but I want to note that most people believe that there is a relationship between rights and enforceability, and it’s helpful in illustrating the difference between justice and morality.

With justice and morality distinguished, socialism, or other forms of government tend not to discuss the differences between the different moral theories. In fact, libertarianism, socialism, and the others are all compatible with the Big Three moral theories: deontology, virtue ethics, but I couldn’t find anything in the literature).
______________

**Libertarianism**

The question libertarianism tries to answer, to put it another way, “What are our rights?”.

*What are Rights?*

Libertarianism is most at home with, they have violated a person’s rights. Natural rights theorists have a lot of work to do in making sense of the notion of personal dignity or intrinsic value. We have to avoid Jeremy Bentham’s protest that natural rights are “nonsense upon stilts”.

If rights are natural, it is hard to argue that institutionalized immorality is unjust if that action would not be unjust in a social vacuum. Institutionalization seems to be a matter of degree; there is no “magic number” of institutionalization at which point it offends dignity. Non-libertarians have to argue for an asymmetry. Arguments for libertarianism trade on the qualitative difference between justice and morality. I think this is a difference that one can believe in without undue privilege. If you’d like to talk more about this, please PM me.

Natural rights theories are among the most popular accounts of rights. The other main accounts of the source of rights are consequential or instrumental and contractual.

* Instrumental theories say that rights are an instrument for some goal. Instrumental accounts are thought to give rise to rights that are too weak and are charged with letting the ends justify the means. We have the rights we do because enforcing *these* rules (and not others) is the best way to bring about some end. So if the end could be better served by killing someone, instrumental rights are the most popular among philosophers.

* Contractual theories can be found in John Rawls and Thomas Scanlon. On a contractual account, for Scanlon, ideally reasonable people) cannot really give us a reason to act unless there are already natural or instrumental rights there to provide the reason.

*What are Our Rights?*

Libertarians argue that rights are very limited. You have a right to self-ownership or autonomy and you have a right to obtain and hold property. These should both be understood as forms of control over the thing in question. If we accept the relationship between justice and enforcement, and no one can make a promise or sign a contract on your behalf unless you have already given them permission to do so.

* Autonomy

Everyone who believes in rights believes that autonomy is one, respect for autonomy is at the core of rights talk; some arguments for equal opportunity try to establish that the social, political, and economic barriers oppressed groups face constitute affronts to their autonomy. Libertarians respond that their notion of control is too strong and leads to bad consequences. There is no principled distinction that licenses Affirmative Action, say, but not other illegitimate forms of government interference. Since there is no principled difference, they are both illegitimate. The challenge for the egalitarian is to establish how illegitimate taxation does, impede autonomy. This is very near the dispute over [positive and negative freedoms]( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/). (You won’t find a resolution to the debate there

* Property

The libertarian understanding of property is descended from John Locke’s discussion. He famously held that in order for someone to acquire a piece of property, and tending to the sheep. When a person mixes their blood, sweat, and tears with an unowned thing, they extend their autonomy into it. It becomes a part of their personhood, in a way. If a person does something to an owner’s property against their will, they have offended against that person’s autonomy since it was partially “in” that item. The best way to understand how “extended autonomy” works is on analogy with [extended minds]( http://philpapers.org/browse/the-extended-mind/), I think the poster misunderstands the nature of the social contract and what natural rights are)

Robert Nozick has pointed out a serious problem with acquisition as mixing of labor. If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it into the sea

Another problem comes from Locke himself. If I own some land, to put it another way, how can labor be rightfully alienated?

These two objections are powerful, Rights, and the Moral Community* and Hillel Steiner’s 1981 liberty and equality are both attempts to cash this note in.

There are also special concerns having to do with [intellectual property](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/). A libertarian can

________________
**Left- and Right-Libertarianism**

When thinking about property, though most libertarians subscribe to the Lockean proviso in some form or another. The Lockean proviso holds that natural resources can be appropriated as long as enough and as good is left for others. Nozick, the paradigmatic right-libertarian, interprets this to mean that no one should be left worse off by resource acquisition than they would have been had the resource been left alone.

Left-libertarians, and any acquisition beyond that equal share must be compensated. Others think that any resource acquisition whatsoever must be compensated. For more interpretations of the Lockean proviso and more on the distinction between left- and right-libertarianism, see the [SEP entry on libertarianism]( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/).

____________
**Libertarianism and Social Justice**

We have seen that libertarians have a very limited conception of rights

Libertarians should also admit that, libertarians should recognize that these structures are immoral and deeply so. They can and should work to bring an end to these institutions. However, because they do not believe in rights to equal opportunity or social equality, libertarians cannot say that these institutions are unjust. Moreover, taking injustice as the condition for enforceability, libertarians cannot force others to stop perpetuating the institutions. Libertarianism provides no grounds to object to social justice as an idea, it only bars us from calling the movement social *justice* and constrains the methods we can use to right the wrongs.

It is vital to remember that many libertarians *do* deny that privilege or these immoral social structures exist. Their belief in libertarianism surely bolsters this further belief (causally), as a matter of fact, belief in libertarianism leads to denial of social inequality, libertarianism is a dangerous theory.* This doesn’t mean that libertarianism is false: people used Darwinian evolution to support eugenics, but that doesn’t mean that Darwin was wrong. 

A libertarian who is against social justice activism that does not involve legislation misapplies the theory. Libertarians should do everything in their power

I used to stare at this cross-eyed and wonder where this mysterious study was done.  I would even retort

1) How do you do a study like this?  Do you interview victims and ask them how expensive their robber's watch looked at gunpoint?  Do you interview convicts and ask them their employment status and net worth?  Do you ask what kind of car the guy who carjacked you was driving before he jumped out and traded with you?

**A Comparative Study of Crime by (Black and White) Race and a Correlative Analysis of Poverty...**

^...With ^some ^3rd ^Grade ^Math ^On ^Top....

--------------------

The goal of this effortpost is to establish some way of quantifying the correlation between crime and poverty among blacks and whites to address the use of this comparison in Reddit discourse.  My first step in this goal is to establish a series of ratios that can be assigned to blacks and whites based off the analysis of statistically valid numbers.  In this first instance

Using these and the equivalent racial definitions from the US Census categories

 |[White
:--:|:--:|:--: | :--: | :--:
Violent Crime Rates | 58.4% | 22.8% |6.7% | 12.1%

* What I came up with was a ""*criminality ratio*.""  To put it in perspective

 |White| Black| 
:--:|:--:|:--: |
**Criminality Ratio** |0.81| 1.81

* The black population is identified as violent crime offenders at a rate **2.23** times that of whites.

 |White | Black | 
:--:|:--:|:--:
[**Census Bureau Poverty Rates**](http://www.infoplease.com/business/economy/2010-census-poverty.html) | 9.9% |27%

* The black population is impoverished at a rate of **2.73** times that of whites.  To control *only* for the level of poverty

* **Relative Ratio of Violent Crime to Poverty Among Racial Groups**

    (Criminality Ratio/% Poverty)

 |White|Black|
:--:|:--:|:--:
Violent Crime/Poverty | .081 | .067

So the first thing discovered is that, to be precise.

**Note 1:** *76% of all crimes are single-offender crimes (Table 37)*
-----

**zxquarx** notes that [you can't get exact numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/uue3x/effort_crime_and_poverty_in_black_and_white/c4yn0as) from this calculation.  I try to address this and with the addendum below.

-----

*Addendum 6/10 2:05 PM PST*: Note well that this assumes that people above the poverty line commit crimes at the same rate regardless of wealth.  While there is documented correlation between poverty and crime rates

----------------------------------------

Although

[**Pew Research Center Poll on Household Net Worth**](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/07/26/wealth-gaps-rise-to-record-highs-between-whites-blacks-hispanics/)

 |White | Black | 
:--:|:--:|:--:
Household Net Worth in $k | 113 | 5.6

Then you can calculate the relationship so: **Relative Ratio of Violent Crime to Household Net Worth Among Racial Groups** (Household Net Worth in $/Relative Violent Crime Rate).

 |White|Black|
:--:|:--:|:--:
NetWorth/Crime Ratio | 11.41 | 0.21

So, we're talking specifically about poverty and the Fortune 500 otherwise skews the numbers against whites as a group.

I went ahead and used the [UCR arrest rates by race](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-43/10tbl43a.xls) although I have misgivings about it which I will discuss in the notes below.  For those of you unfamiliar

1335508962.0,suydd,[Possible TW] Enthusiastic consent always does real.,consentdoesreal,61,8,11,"I was reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/rvwmo/why_is_this_not_the_default_antirape_stance/) on rape and enthusiastic consent

I'm female, so there is a lot of exploring of boundaries and actively figuring out and redefining what we are comfortable with. We were making out recently when I put my hands inside his pants. He had said something previously that made me think this would be ok, but I did not ask if he was comfortable with it beforehand. He didn't object, and I thought nothing of it. But a few days later, he told me it had really made him uncomfortable and that it upset him that I didn't ask explicitly before doing that. 

I have been feeling terrible about it since - I am furious with myself for failing to do one of the most important parts of enthusiastic consent: continuously checking in with my partner and making sure that enthusiastic consent is still there. I wasn't attentive to his feelings, I think I tend to assume, whether subconsciously or consciously, that he is likely to want to do more sexually than I am and that my comfort level is likely to be the limiting factor. One implication of this is that I did not place sufficiently high importance on actively establishing enthusiastic consent - when I hear feminists talk about enthusiastic consent, I typically think of it as a message primarily directed at men, and I guess I hadn't internalized it as much as I needed to. So when I saw the dominant sentiment in this thread chanting that my wrongdoing ""don't real"", it bothered me - what I did was very wrong

For those who don't know

http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/heres-paula-deens-apology-for-using-the-n-word

I'm just so annoyed because so many of these comments are making a joke of the situation, which from what I see of the site is that it generally has progressive content.

The first top comment I agree with:
&gt;I hate when racists apologize for being racist. It's the way you feel - you can't just say sorry and magically NOT feel the way you do. F** her.

But it's met with a lot of criticism

The second top comment:
&gt;That apology needed more butter.

Sure

&gt;we all have done and said things we regret. I think we all need to be forgiven now and then. Paula is human just like the rest of us

.

&gt;Who amongst us has not used some word that would offend someone these days? NONE! I support her

.
&gt;How would some of you like a Black person coming up to you saying “What’s up poor White trash” You will most likely be offended and label them as racist. But it is acceptable for a white person to call another White person by the same name without being label a racist. Get the point.

~~What does that even mean?~~
**edit** from /u/thefundontstop

&gt;So i should start suing every rap star i hear using the “N” word? Sounds to me like someone who just wants a piece of all the money she has.

That quote exists in several hundred iterations.

And I don't even want to start on all the people coming to her defence on the Food Network website. Or the people who somehow find it relevant to bring Obama into the topic of conversation.

Sometimes it just floors me that people are so racist and don't understand. It also really upsets me when people try to silence victims by telling them to ""get over it."" You have every right to be angry and upset about the situation. 

And how do I explain this to people who try and shut me up? I mean maybe not in the context of Deen but in the other many situations where this happens?

First of all whenever there is any discussion of anti-semitism or jews there seems to be a multitude of posts discussing how horrible Israel is. As if we are all

Second of all. The term PoC or ""opressed people"" includes everyone from asians to latinos to indian to blacks.  That alone I have a bit of a problem with as these people don't have the same experiences.  I've never heard or driving while asian or indian college students being profiled and searched by American police while walking home.  That's not to say that these people do not face prejudice and stereotypes in their own ways

The other thing I have a problem with is that if all of these people by virtue of being a certain race that has been historically marginalized can be categorized as ""oppressed"" Is the thousands of years of oppression that jews have faced ""not enough""?

The Ironic thing is that I hear from tumblr leftists and SRS folks the same type of derailing tactics you'd expect from stormfront or whiterights.  ""Jews are not a race.""  While technically this may be the case Jews can often be identified by facial features and skin tone. I myself am labeled as a Jew whether I want to be or not.  Furthermore anti-semitism has played out in a way that is pretty much identical to racism.  With people being mistreated for being born to the wrong parents or looking the wrong way (Nazi racial science was heavily influenced by the same racial science used to justify slavery and classify various ethnic groups in Africa during imperialism) So for people who claim to be ""anti-racist"" to sweep that under the rug is very discouraging to say the least.

1335722501.0,syea0,[SRSEdu] [TW and CW] Race: Beyond black and white.,Impswitch,63,14,20,"**Race: Beyond black and white**

SRSEducation night was a great success! Thanks so much to all our speakers and all those who attended. Beyond a minor low-effort trolling incident at the beginning the conversation was very informative and respectful.

This is just a description. Don't argue about race in the comments please

Here is a link to the full logs

For those who are not interested in going through 5.5 hours worth of the conversation (although I do recommend you do because it’s *very* informative!) here’s a long tl;dr

Introduction:

The objective was to present to you the perspectives of PoC

* Nadir of race relations in the United States.
* Reconstruction improved the lives of PoC of all types.
* When support for it was removed PoCs lives got worse.
* Support was removed because of pressure from the white populace in the South and the North.
* The murder of Vincent Chin:
* Vincent Chin was a Detroit student who was due to be married. In 1982, Japanese (note: *Japanese*) car manufacturers were overtaking the Detroit auto industry. And these two men, in misguided vengeance, went out and beat the first Asian person they saw to *death.* Vincent Chin was not an auto worker. Vincent Chin was not Japanese. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
* The two men were sentenced to 3 years probation and a 3000 dollar fine. The judge was quoted as saying ""These weren't the kind of men you send to jail... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.""
* The incident helped to created a Pan-Asian movement of solidarity
* The Vancouver Police and RCMP are in trouble in Canada for basically ignoring the murder of dozens of First Nations women.
* Harper shut down Sisters in Spirit
* “Residential schools” for First Nations is a good place to begin looking up Racism in Canada
* The most important part of all of this is unified racial movements emerging from these events
* We unite across nationalities and ethnicities because the world is *hostile*.
* That's linked to how racism is defined here
* Racism as a system that can be reinforced by thoughts, and I want to point out that that definitely doesn't have to be true.


Important references: 

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir_of_American_race_relations
* A great book on Aboriginal oppression in Canada is called Prison of Grass

Race Relations:

* We're really only used to seeing it as white vs. ___, how do we build more solidarity.
* LA  Race Riots of 1992: So to give a bit of an overview, and that was what sparked the race riots. the problem was that the damage done was largely to the Korean community in Los Angeles at the time, and to complicate issues, a black girl was shot by a Korean store manager who thought she was attempting to steal.
* Part of the reason the riots escalated is because the LAPD didn't see ethnic enclaves or neighborhoods as a priority. They left the city so abandoned that Korean Americans had to form vigilante groups to protect their stores. And it ignored the whole issue about how the Korean Americans were sort of recent immigrants to the area and the black Americans who have lived there for a long time felt that they were taking away economic agency by running all the convenience stores/groceries etc.
* Some of it was justified because black people *were* disenfranchised w/r/t economics. They have always had the short end of the stick when it comes to the nation's wealth. This just compounded it. But a lot of that anger was misdirected toward the Korean community. Especially when you consider the ""perpetual foreigner"" stereotype that Asians have to battle.
* Wen Ho Lee
* ""But EVERYONE'S racist can't you see?!"" Is not an excuse to be racist. 
* The perpetual foreigner stereotype is something so many PoC have to deal with. One of the worst parts of it
* Perpetual foreigner is something that is used by white media and white interests to divide PoC.
* Many white people love the ""prejudice only"" definition of racism, or that they may be doing something racist without realizing it. Saying, “But I’m not affecting overt violence or abuse, so it can’t be racist,” is a derail and perpetuates this idea of racism being only overtly violent actions against PoC.

Beauty standards:

* The ""white"" perspective dominates even our choice of partners, PoC included, when told to envision their ideal mate, will automatically envision someone who is white.
* Basically, is based heavily in classism, racism, etcetera. It dictates that to be beautiful, you probably should start off being white. Preferably blond. If not, you should have some measure of Eurocentric features. For example, the reason asian hair is considered ""beautiful"" is because it is straight and full - ""white"" features. That focus is clearly rooted deeply in our history and one way of marginalizing and eliminating black women (and people) throughout history is to other them. The first thing we are 'othered' by is our completely opposing set of features when compared to white people. Especially women.
* “Exotic” is often used to describe PoC who have “white” features; the term implies a fetishization aspect to the beauty of PoC.
* Sarah Baartman is a good example of fetishization.
* Tropes about black women are based in the slave breeding myth and impressions from legends like Sojourner Truth. Strong, the equivalent to the Asian stereotype ""Dragon lady"" (if you recognize it), Jezebel and Mammy.
* Hair relaxers are commonly used on black women in order to make their hair “like everyone else’s”. It is expensive and damaging to the hair
* In the 60s and seventies we saw one of the first natural hair movements. That’s when the Afro burst onto the scene. And it was a big deal and not ""Just hair"" because black people’s hair is always relatable to being “uncivilized animals”. Black radicals wore afros for a very obvious reason.
* The Paper Bag test was something used at college sororities or yore. The black ones. A fine example of internalized racism/shadism. Your skin had to match a brown paper bag and be no darker or you couldn’t join. 
* Blue vein societies are a southern -and- a sorority issue and also of not-so-long-ago days of yore. If you weren't light enough to see the bluish tint of your veins
* Colourism in the Asian communities has other influences. In china for example, rich. With black folks, its means you're prettier somehow. More ""exotic"" or just ""good enough"", commonly, depending on if you're talking to black people or white people. In Hispanic communities it's also tied to nativephobia, and mixed blood Cherokee are given higher status but that's been going on since Andrew Jackson days. Mixed blood Cherokees were all in families of high wealth and prestige

* “Random Black Girl [Singing the Soul]”: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbbewRSc-C0

Mixed race:

* Stereotypes about appearance dominate the issue about “how to classify” a person who is mixed race. Commonly, rather than based upon visual standards of beauty. If you are biracial and fall on the wrong side of classification, you do get many of the subtle racist comments or actions, such as watching you closer in a store, speaking slightly more slowly to you, asking if you can speak x language, and conflation of many different cultures into one large conglomeration (particularly prevalent with Native Amercians, Asian
* Mixed race, they have “history”. It is common that these “cultures” are perpetually made to be pre-modern and shamanic stereotypes are one of those attempts.
* The words Hispanic and even Latino are Anglo and European inventions. Similarly
* PoC will never be able to claim a real slice of the pie unless they figure out how to build identities that aren't based on internalized white definitions and assumptions. Assumptions like what language(s) you speak, all play into this.
* Long before the bracero program or before the mass migration started California relied on ""asian"" labor. Part of bringing in Mexican migrants was because of resentment and hatred of Asian Americans so Mexicans displaced quite a few agriculture workers
and railroad companies


Important resources:

* Trail of tears.
* Mexican lynching during reconstruction

Race and Education:

* Basically, meaning all classifications on race is treated as suspect. They actually think that we need to be rid of race as a classification in 25 years. This is the majority opinion of the supreme court of our land. So now we're not allowed to try and racially balance our schools. The result? Poor black schools with severe neglect. School violence skyrocketing. Poor teachers. Lack of resources. Schools where there's a 40-60% drop-out rate for students of color. This is compounded by factors like school funding, which is tied to residential racial segregation, which is affected by racist laws regarding housing. 
* So
* Pedagogy in these mostly black schools is really awful and mostly serve to teach these black/minority children how to follow directions and sit obediently. That way when they graduate they can move on to some minimum wage job that will offer no advancement opportunities. It's really no surprise kids drop out and lose interest in school.
* Education reform in the US is “mostly focused on the ""achievement gap"" and how do we solve the race issue in schools”. Right now the solution is to privatize schools,"" etc. All of these solutions kind of sideline the funding issue of our public schools. There are awesome public schools. They are mostly white.
* Education researchers and academics have tried and tried to get the courts to acknowledge that during the period where we tried bussing, working in a mostly black school that lacks resources is a completely shit job. Many teachers get no support from administration or the organization TFA, and quit quickly. So the bad teacher trope is largely a myth. There are amazing teachers that work in these schools under impossible conditions. We really need to find a way to support our teachers. And it's not just about shitty teachers, this problem is so much bigger and systemic than that.
* Magnet schools are usually pretty good public schools. The thing with magnet schools is sometimes people of color get sidelined even *within* schools. They put all the white kids in the good magnet program and relegate the ""bad"" kids in the regular program.
* Asians overwhelmingly do better at traditional education
* There's actually research that shows when a school is racially balanced, nice school with competent teachers.
* The civil-rights era busing period could be considered analogous to Reconstruction: It seems like things got better when there was active support
* A lot of people have the misconception that affirmative action actively hurts anti-racism, ""as a black person you've had to work this much harder to get to where you are today to be on the same footing with this white person."" But it is non-perfect. We don't know how certain institutions like colleges and workplaces implement the policy.

Q&amp;As:

* Q: Are there any positive steps we can take towards that deconstruction? What can we do to help reduce otherisation?

* A: Frankly, especially since we struggle so much with finding a way to even voice our concerns. But, the inherent problem here is that minority anger isn't taken as a sign of what it is- frustration at the things we're expected to just shoulder.

* Q: So those are great personal steps

* A: ""hey, who don't really have a personal connection to the whole thing.

Interracial dating: 

* Every subgroup has its own particular stereotype about relationships. All the ones about PoC, there is a constant, constant message that asian-american men are sexless and poor lovers. From penis jokes to portrayals in movies, it all ties back into this idea. This leads to a lot of tension when PoC try to date outside of their own particular ethnicity. 
* There are two ways to go with unsavory racial implications of dating. There's ""Will not date members of x race"" and there's ""Will only date members of x race."" Both of those are just as awful. Being fetishized is not any better than being outright rejected because they both come from the same place - the idea that PoC are this monolithic block of people who all have the same characteristics. So
* It doesn't matter why you're being fetishized

Cultural appropriation:

* Do not get tattoos of kanji/hanzi characters unless you can read them. English speakers love to make fun of ""engrish"" but they often fail to recognize the random characters as tattoos, ""duality"" is an incredibly facile reading of it.

* Neopagan white people you do not have spirit animals. Neopagans appropriate a lot of mysticism from various Native American tribes and it is really annoying when they take various rituals for their stuff.

[Fanboys](http://www.fanboys-online.com/) | [First Comic](http://www.fanboys-online.com/index.php?id=2) is about the only gamers-on-a-couch comic I could ever think of recommending to anyone. This comic is hilarious for all the right reasons. This one does rely a lot on character humor so starting from the top is recommended. As such I must warn that it's very rough and unpolished in the beginning. Note that sometimes Slipshine ads will show up on the site

[Brawl In The Family](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/) | [First Comic](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/2008/05/01/alpha-comik/) is an adorable comic about the Nintendo universe. You cannot find a more kid-friendly atmosphere than this. The artist once worried the word crud would bother his audience. This comic relies a lot on knowledge of Nintendo games but does have plenty of character humor that relies on the comic's built-up personalities instead of the 'canon' version of that character. The yearly Christmas comics are an amazing treat!

And my favorite non-gaming comics:

[Wasted Talent](http://www.wastedtalent.ca/) | [First Comic](http://www.wastedtalent.ca/comic/anime-crack) is an autobiographical comic by Angela Melick

[El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/) | [First Comic](http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2002-01-21) is, often supernatural, situations that they face. Includes a continuing storyline with non-linear joke comics on the side. WARNING: Often ignores the laws of Physics."" To be more exact it's a comic about magic, science, relationships, genderbending, acceptance, but takes a loooong while to really get good.

Here's the information you need:

Also
● 1 Stay on message; we deal with the genocide of White people and the perpetrators, NWO, etc. White genocide is the first step to establish a beachhead in the general population's consciousness -- we can expand on other ideas later.

● 2 Use the Mantra and our talking points. Everything anti-Whites say always leads to our genocide

● 3 Use our terminology; ""Anti-White"", ""Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White"", ""Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians, White countries for everybody"".

● 4 ""Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White"" should be the last thing in your post if possible.

● 5 Don't use their terminology; ""racist"" should ONLY be used in ""anti-racist""; ""nazi"" should ONLY be used in naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews""; ""HATE!"", ""multicultural"" can be pointed out as meaning less White people. Avoid using ""The White race"", ""Caucasians"", ""The Whites"", because it makes it look distant and turns it into a philosophical debate; use 'Our people', 'My people', 'White people'

● 6 Capitalize ""White""

● 7 ALWAYS use ""Genocide"", ""Demographics shift"", etc.

● 8 NEVER call them ""antis""

● 9 Use ""As an anti-White"" e.g. ""As an anti-White why do you think more assimilation is required in ONLY White countries?"".

● 10 Don't argue, that they must accept millions of non-Whites and 'assimilate' with them, which is genocide under UN genocide conventions. If people get annoyed of hearing our message that's good, it means they can remember it!

● 11 This isn't about anti-Whites; we are talking to the general public

● 12 Be aggressive and take the moral high-ground; if they call you names say ""You're only saying that because I'm White"".

● 13 Think before you talk. Talking about commiting violence is a no-go. No talking about genocide tribunals because it makes us look dangerous. Using lots of bad language is going to make you - and us - look stupid. That does not mean treat anti-Whites with dignity.

● 14 YOU ask the questions. If you don't get a reply keep asking them - it means your opponent is embarrassed and is trying to get off the subject. If they demand you answer questions say ""WE ask the questions

● 15 Use emotional language; ""Why do you hate little White children?""

● 16 Winning isn't important; you should be winning all of the arguments with the anti-Whites if you do what Bugsters do

● 17 Know your target audience and wrap our message around what appeals to them. Young adults want to talk about education fees and housing prices, etc. Try to connect with the people using their language/colloquialisms e.g. ""Dude"" ""Mate"" ""Bloke"" ""Howdy"" ""Yeah"" ""Lol"" ""Rofl""

● 18 Flip the script. What if ALL Asian countries were told to bring in immigrants and assimilate with them? What if ""anti-racists"" in Africa demanded that Africans stopped patrolling their borders and kicking out illegal immigrants?

● 19 We're all part of the team. Remember to report any places that you post The Mantra or mini-Mantras in Where did you post the Mantra today? II Bugsters will offer you advice if you're new

I think one of the big reasons my perspective is different is because I'm a teenager (I just turned 16).

I probably shouldn't give the benefit of the doubt like that when there's a small chance it's an adult who's out of college

Now, healthy people are not attracted to pre-pubescent bodies, I think. So being attracted to them, when you factor in them being children who are vulnerable, can't consent, etc. is a serious, serious issue and you should see a therapist/stay away from kids, it's absolutely wrong to act on that attraction in any way towards them

William Ryan's ""Blaming the Victim"" part 1",13,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/12x6ec/lets_read_along_with_kprimus_william_ryans/,"Welcome to the first part of an indefinite part series where I summarize and quote passages from books that I think everyone here ought to read sometime.

Our first subject is a seminal work of radical sociology, or otherwise marginalized communities were in fact methodologies to ""correct"" the behavior of the *marginalized* rather than fixing the environment, societal, and economic factors that create those behaviors.

Chapter 1 is a general overview of the attitudes and methodologies of well-meaning victim blamers. In particular, teenage and unmarried pregnancy, health care, slums, law enforcement, and much more. If these examples sound familiar, it is because they are the same problems that remain to this day unfixed and unaddressed.

For reference

Ryan explains blaming the victim as a way for those guilty of perpetuating the attitudes and issues that marginalize the powerless to assuage their guilty consciences while still giving the appearance of ""making progress.""

&gt;By focusing our attention on the Negro Family as the apparent *cause* of racial inequality our eye is diverted. Racism, and the powerlessness of the ghetto are subtly, but thoroughly, downgraded in importance.

&gt;The problems are there, and this must be explained to the satisfaction of our conscience as well as our patriotism. Blaming the victim is an ideal, almost painless evasion.

&gt;The second step in apply this explanation is to look sympathetically at those who ""have"" the problem in question... and define them in some way as a special group, less knowing- in short, less human.

He then gives the example of campaigns to ""inform"" inner city parents against the dangers of allowing their children to eat or be exposed to lead paint. He points out that when said children are harmed by such exposure, *the presence of the lead paint itself is the fault of slum landlords illegally using dangerous paint and failing to maintain their buildings.* The solution to the problem is not to tell the parents to perform impossible acts of childrearing- it is to properly regulate and punish those who are exploiting and abusing the poor. Blaming the victims allows those responsible and those complicit by inaction to force attention away from the central target, societal inequality, discrimination, and racism, and onto the individual affected.

&gt;In each case, the gross deprivation of contraceptive and adoptive services to the poor, the heavy stresses endemic in the life of the poor. And almost all our make-believe liberal programs aimed at correcting our urban problems are off target; they are either designed to change the poor man or cool him out.

1325456796.0,nyzul,On abstaining from raping people,dedaigneux,57,8,82,"I don't understand why rape is such a contentious topic.

Honestly

If, it seems obvious that one should *ask*, perhaps more than once. Hilariously, this idea of *asking* for sex is somehow considered unsexy. You mean some people don't want to be told that you want to have sex with them? Honestly, it's like someone just assumed that the only way to consent to sex is to say ""I consent to sex right now"" in a very dry, asexual, posh voice. Doesn't anyone think it's sexy to be told what someone wishes you to do to them? I think it's hot. Come on

And what's with the bizarre scenarios? I get that the impulse to navel gaze is alluring. I have a degree in Philosophy

These hypotheticals usually surround one of two issues: drinking and other substances that impair judgment

Furthermore, and that it follows that imprisoning or convicting someone of rape that they did not commit is therefore, even more rare.

It seems foolish to treat rape accusations as uniquely dubious when we don't level the same sort of criticisms  against other crimes like theft or murder. If people were actually apt to accuse the rich and powerful of a crime in order to profit off of it, settlements in such cases are nowhere near as profitable as those for cases involving things like personal injury or employment discrimination.

The most oft-stated reason one would wish to ""cry rape"" is shame of being caught having sex. Why then would anyone want to draw attention to the idea that they had sex, or more, solely concerned with their own sexual behavior as it is scrutinized by the legal system and the court of popular opinion. Of course, that also begs the question, where are these people that are uniquely supportive of rape victims? What perceived gain is there to accusing someone of rape that isn't the fevered delusions of someone utterly unfamiliar with the way our actual and public opinion ""courts"" work?

But back to the calculation of whether or not to have sex in the first place. Who, chooses the former as the acceptable risk but not the latter? It's incredibly foolish, short-minded, and irresponsible to risk violating someone in such a grave manner simply because one wishes to have an orgasm. Yet, it's given as a coherent objection to the idea of establishing consent, as if doing the incredibly easy task of not raping people is actually demonizing all forms of human sexuality. I suppose that if your sexuality revolves only around conquer, force, it might seem rather disappointing to have to have sex with people who actually want to have sex with you too. Of course

Finally, it's somehow coherent to claim that having sex with someone in particular way at any given point establishes consent to have sex at any other point in any other fashion.

Who actually thinks that way?!? Likewise, being nice, wearing certain clothing, or acting in any sort of fashion whatsoever that may sexually arouse anyone else.

How does any of how we talk about consent and rape not drive everyone absolutely mad? It makes no sense at all in any rational sense of the world.

&gt;This stems(lol stem) from the somewhat flawed belief that nerds should be a protected class and respected as a legitimate minority, etc. there's a nebulous belief that outsiders only want to heckle them, or are just doing it for attention/to be cool or attempt to gain their respect through association with their group. That's something a wall of text could be written about on its own. 

&gt;But before I lose you here, actual art, and well, nerd stuff.

&gt;i'm not saying this kind of shit doesn't happen in other fandoms, etc. the poop runs deep. 

&gt;basically, and the ""legitimacy of their scene"". and every time they kick and scream and spew this shit *everyone who isn't a fucking awful nerd* wonders if it really *is* just some pet rock fleeting thing that only shitty nerds care about. 

&gt;but don't listen to me. i'm just a guy who knows people all around the industry from one guy iOS game devs to major studios, and has also been involved in several small music scenes, and is friends with all manners of artists and musicians(and is also an artist/musician trailing back to music school in the 90s) from people who play basement shows to people who play sold out festivals.

--------

As an Arab American woman raised in a conservative Muslim family

The messages about gender that I received from my parents, religious teachers, and so on ranged from subtle to extreme. I was told, among other things, that:

Women can't speak during prayer to correct an Imam (men can) because their voices are too ""distracting."" (This is based on the hadith
Women should lower their eyes in the presence of men. (To be fair the stuff about lowering one's gaze is also directed toward men
Women shouldn't wear tampons, people outside of Islam also debate the issue. So I have only anecdotal comments here in that every Muslim woman I've known has been told something to this effect, and on a personal level, when my mom discovered I was using tampons, she completely freaked out, started screaming, and threatened to take me to the doctor and have them check to see if my hymen was still intact, this is anecdotal
There are passages in the Quran that advocate beating disobedient wives (see this paragraph""In fact, to hit"" - Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, page 538"").
Polygamy is legal and practiced in many Muslim countries and permitted by the Quran
... and so on and so forth. Honestly it would take me hours (and probably lots of therapy) to be able to cogently list all of the misogynistic aspects of this religion and the cultures that have flourished from it. Maybe some of the aforementioned things seem minor, so many things have made me feel like my religion hated women.

It's ridiculous to me to hear qualifying statements that Islam is ""paternalistic, there is little to no distinction between the two.

I'm not saying by any means that these characteristics are unique to Islam. But the question was not ""Is Islam more misogynistic than other religions?"" but rather ""Is Islam misogynistic?""

Some people have mentioned that there is a distinction between culture and religion in Muslim countries. I would argue that that's not really true, and this basically dominates the culture. Public newscasters casually attribute occurrences to Allah without any controversy, domestic airlines recite surahs from the Quran over the intercom during flights, and so on.

Muslim countries touted as being more liberal, where the laws and regulations are for the most part drawn from edicts in the Quran and where ""religious police"" (note that they aren't called the cultural police) patrol the streets, harassing women for showing their ankles, preventing women from driving, enforcing the laws that prevent women from working or travelling without permission from a male guardian, and oh, don't forget ""beating young girls"" to prevent them from escaping a fire because they weren't wearing proper religious dress.
I understand, sometimes it bothers me, and I think people can try too hard to be ""politically correct,"" for lack of a better expression, about this topic and overlook the reality of life in Islam.

I'd like to reassert my argument that Muslim countries heralded as being more liberal are not following Islam as strictly. Any Muslim country that affords, is not actually following the Quran (one male witness equals two female witnesses). The same holds true for countries where polygamy is illegal, and in most cases for any Muslim who affords a female heir the same inheritance as a male heir.",,False,,t5_2t5sa,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/

**Note: This is written from a Western

**What is deafness and Deafness?**

deafness is the audological condition of being deaf. Viewed as a disability by able bodied/hearing culture.

Deafness is not about ears or about disability. Deafness is about being culturally Deaf - usually being deaf in some way and knowing ASL and participating in the local Deaf community.

**OK

Deaf people view who they are as being a way of life in a positive manner. Certainly we do lack hearing

* disabled
* hearing impaired

\* Here

**Deaf culture as an ethnic group**

Deaf people are an ethnic group as indicated by the capital D. Deaf culture has a few things...

* a visual sign language - ASL\*
* values and norms that are primarily visual

\* There are other sign languages around the world

Most people that aren't Deaf are called Hearing people. Hearing people have a few things ...

* an aural language - English
* values and norms that are primarily aural

**Values and norms**

All cultures have values and norms. Deafness and Hearingness are not exceptions.

One big norm that I think you have noticed about being Hearing is that it is extremely privileged. Being able to hear is so extremely supported and reinforced in this culture. In other words...

* you don't have to say that you are able to hear
* you can go anywhere and receive and send communication by speaking and hearing
* you don't have to say that you are part of yet another ethnic group. White maybe yes

Deaf people

* ignorance
* being bigoted (audism)
* impatience with communicating with a Deaf person
* being unwilling to learn even how to say hi or thank you or you're welcome in ASL

Let me provide you with an example. A guy I knew, he was a nice guy, and wasn't shy at all. There was just one thing, though, sometimes in the midst of all the fun and jokes, he would make these super creepy sexual remarks about the women around him - in their presence.

""Man, ""Oh man, it smells like Julie's cunt again!"", ""What happened to your butt Joanna, did it get bigger?""

Now, as if some sort of clever joke, even by those targeted. These weren't just one-off comments, they were almost like obsessions, coming up again and again, sometimes even on a daily basis, as if some sort of sick running gag.

I'm not shy, but I never understood this. I never, ever found this to be funny. At all. And I've seen more than a few men do exactly this, with exactly that reception. What is going on, SRSD?

Intersectionality holds that **the classical conceptualizations of oppression within society, such as racism, sexism, and religion-based bigotry

Thus, class, ethnicity) are bound together and relate to one another within cultural patterns of oppression. 

While the reflection of interaction between different identity categories began in feminist theory in the 1970s and 1980s

&gt; Consider an analogy to traffic in an intersection
directions. Discrimination
may flow in one direction
happens in an intersection
any number of directions and,
if a Black woman is harmed because she is in an intersection
could result from sex discrimination or race discrimination […] But

The interlocking martrix of opression (which was created in [this essay](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/252.html) by  [Particia Hill Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Hill_Collins) - ([Works](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=patricia+hill+collins&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C43&amp;as_sdtp=on))) explains issues of oppression that deal with the way different social classfications (gender, sexual orientation, age, etc) are interconnected. 

This theory is most simplistically illustrated using the example of [Colin Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell):

&gt; Many argue that [Powell's] success (as one Black man out of millions) is proof that discrimination based on race has been, but proponents of the theory of the matrix of domination would argue that this overlooks issues of social class, gender, and age, Powell being an upper class, middle-aged/elderly male. - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_Domination)

The various intersections of social inequality are also sometimes referred to as *the vectors of oppression and privilege*. 

**[Standpoint Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)**

Standpoint Theory can basically be watered down into the idea that an individuals' perspectives are influenced by their own unique lived experiences in social locations and groups. For example

&gt; if there are two Hispanic women in a group, their standpoints are not completely the same. - [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)

Societal knowledge is, making knowledge vary dependent upon the social conditions which produced said knowledge. Thus, *situated knowledge* is knowledge that we gain from our lived experiences. Out of this theory, the feminist variant [standpoint feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_feminism) was created.

So, and pushed through university. We got married, and we moved to Canada when I received a job offer here. 

A few months later, so other than the basic living commodities and 2 laptops, our house is basically devoid of personality or decoration. We basically put our money into the house, bills, food, and savings. 

At this point

My husband is pretty adamant about raising our child in a sort of pseudo-low class environment. Basically, (after infancy), we will buy them very few toys (birthdays and Christmas) and basically just pretend to be poor until the kid is in their teens, probably when they start high school. We'll encourage the kid to have a small job like delivering flyers to earn some pocket change (which my husband will accompany them on for safety reasons).

So now you're probably wondering
Well

In his words (I'm paraphrasing a bit here), he feels that his approach will teach the kid to work hard for things that they do want and teach good values. 

I can kind of understand where he's coming from, and I personally don't mind living in a small apartment since it's still much bigger than the place I grew up in. 

However

Opinions would be appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR: Husband and I are planning a kid. Husband wants to raise them in a pseudo-low class environment to teach good values. I'm not sure how to feel. 


**UPDATE** After seeing the overwhelmingly negative reactions to this idea, and we've come around and decided that we'll skip the whole apartment thing. We still feel like it's important to teach good work ethic and appreciation of money so we'll still try to get them to do chores for pocket change and maybe get a paper route.

I really want to understand trans issues better but I can't seem to find any good explanation. I don't understand how someone can identify as the opposite sex - I have never really felt strongly as though I'm a woman, I am having trouble moving past the idea of transgenderedness as anything but a threat to feminism, doesn't it inherently challenge the idea that gender is socially constructed? I have heard people say that trans folk identify with the sex role of the opposite sex, but what does this mean? And aren't our experiences of the sex roles of the opposite sex always anchored in gender roles? How do you 'know' that you identify as a woman or as a man - isn't it based on societal constructions of gender, and how well you assess yourself as fitting or not fitting in with them?

I understand that part of the insider humor involves poking fun at the ""stereotypical redditor, very really transphobic use of stereotypes, it subverts the sorts of lazy and offensive humor that many redditors deem ""edgy.""


What I take issue with is when this type of humor turns into a value judgment
&gt;What put me off the most was that reddit's idea of ""intellectual"" is basically ""smeart and so geek!"" Like, philosophers, writers, etc. You know, the old ""it's so nice to meet another solipsist!"" type joke.

&gt;The entire thread is LE PUN LE ENGINEER LE MATH. Knowing number systems is not anywhere close to the classical meaning of ""intellectual."" What the fuck reddit.

This is not a complaint about something ""bigoted, transphobic, racist, homophobic, or just reeking of unexamined, toxic privilege."" This is demarcating the lines of what one person considers to be ""intellectual"" as a means of insulting an entire thread of Redditors who had nothing to do with one particular misogynistic comment.

[As a side note, and I've always found it pretty hilarious. Which I suppose makes AdequateSteve's sexist take on it all the more offensive.]

Okay, and the only people of my family who are in this country are my parents and I. Point being, we're not very rooted, and for a pretty long time we were poor but now we are less so.

***You would be hard pressed to find an immigrant whose family is in a tough financial situation (as tends to be the case)

Why? I'm going to try to explain it the way I see it.

When you go to college, one that is likely to have a high financial output compared to the financial input). When I was looking up statistics on the internet and asking around, I was generally informed that degrees in technology, science, and business are more likely to get you a stable and high income. My parents bought a house recently, and I need to start paying that off as soon as I get out of college or they will be working for the rest of their lives. Not too different from a lot of other stories I've heard around.

Statistics tell us that business, or if you have financial obligations, you cannot afford to make an bad investment in college. If all degrees have equal economic utility, I would probably be pursuing illustration, but I can't. I can't ""fuck around,"" so to speak. This has been a silent understanding between myself and every other person in a similar situation that I have ever met. **There is no cushion for us, should we take the risk of pursuing a degree considered ""low utility"" and ultimately fail to make money with it.**

The point is that it strikes me as an injustice that someone who is in a position to study arts or social sciences in college would go around calling STEM majors misogynistic neckbeards when the very fact that they can afford to study arts or social sciences shows that they are privileged on several axes that those ""STEM beckbeards"" may not be.

The looks of disdain from them as they realise I qualify for the same size as people they consider to be 'fat' but don't look the part.

He's buying me a halloween costume this year because I'm going to my first ever Halloween party. I sat with him as we searched through the net for the perfect costume

I told him it would never fit me

This leads to a row resulting in him taking my measurments and discovering I am indeed a size 16.

That was released as a mainstream

This is what anti-pornography feminists have fought, root and branch.

Anyway

Anti-Porn feminism arose and is commonly seen as a major movement within the Second Wave of feminism. Major proponents of anti-porn feminism include Andrea Dworkin, and Page Mellish.

Major arguments against pornography from a feminist perspective include but are not limited to:

Production of pornography entails physical, recent trends in pornography [increasingly rely on and depict increasingly violent and abusive treament of behavior (in particular, ""gonzo"" pornography,) which regardless of the supposed ""consent"" of the performers constitute rape and sexual assault.] (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220#)[Bonus: Penn and Teller are shits](http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html)



[""Pornographic films and magazines eroticize the sexual assault
[""Pornography is a form of defamatory speech against women and can precipitate invidious forms of discrimination against women.""](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por)
[Pornography is ""sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed

These arguments fall under the greater umbrella of the concept that pornography inherently treats women as sex objects

This sexual objectification leads, and rape is the practice."" In particular, viewing the degrading practices depicted in pornography, from the seemingly innocuous (money shots, interminable blowjob scenes) to the obvious (choking, unwarned and unlubricated anal sex, pinning or restraint of struggling women) is likely to lead to people become desensitized to such behavior. In particular, in the same way that PUA does- no means yes, that meant more beer. When she said she would prefer to go home
In short

Pornography promotes a distorted and distasteful view of the human body and human sexuality, man-dominant, man-pleasure focused view of the sexual experience that makes it impossible for women to enjoy a truly equal sexual relationship.

Of course, ""Does pornography cause violence against women? Pornography *is* violence against women.""

Then, against the women in the pornography (many have said that the biggest trauma for them is know that people are still viewing images of rapes perpetrated against them on porn sets)

And the third one is at the point of women seeing or catching a glimpse of the pornography. This one needs some explanation: speech can be a thing which refers to something else, e.g. ""You're fired!"". When identifying pornography as direct harm against women viewers it's this second kind of definition used - pornography directly changes the experience of that woman, because it ties in with a lot of power structures to reach in and twist.

*with thanks to catherinethegrape*

In light of these arguments, or propagation.

**Well what about queer/feminist/yaoi/insert subcategory here?**

Those are so small a minority of sexually explicit depictions as a whole as to be useless except as a deflectionary tactic. On top of that, is too tainted to use for the expression of genuine, mutual sexual satisfaction, and ""erotica."" Other anti-porn feminists dispute this claim, since we live in a patriarchal system and all erotic content is inherently poisoned thereof. Dworkin writes in opposition ""erotica is simply high-class pornography: better produced, better conceived, better executed, designed for a better class of consumer."" Ellen Willis puts it, from that other

Also, racism, fetishizing the ""weird."" Same shit in a slightly less problematic sheath.

**What about porn production as an expression of personal sexuality? Is it inherently bad?**

Anti-porn feminists differ on this subject drastically- Steinem and similar would defend that as ""erotica"" while Dworkin and similar would condemn it as continuing to buy into a patriarchal system of sexual commodification and degradation.

**I don't agree with your definition of pornography**

Then find a different word to describe what you're talking about, and acceptance of this definition of pornography is *essential* for understanding what anti-porn feminists are talking about.

**But anti-porn is out of date with the emergence of the internet!**

If anything, grand majority of pornography has not changed- and if anything has gotten worse, especially considering the increasing sexualization of completely unconsenting victims whose private pictures are stolen.

**Well all media is tainted by patriarchal society. Why single out porn?**

""All media"" is not the same thing as porn, oppression olympics is never the proper response to an argument like this. Porn is a major area of work because it *matters,* is *everywhere,* and, in the view of anti-porn feminists, is a *primary source* of rape culture and misogynistic views, as well as being *inherently* harmful to the women involved at every step of production and consumption.

**You're just a pru-**

Don't even start with that shit.

A debate has followed on whether women should now be obligated to register with the Selective Service System. The SSS is a registry of all US citizen and resident non-citizens eligible for military conscription; it is obligatory for males age to register within 3 days of their 18th birthday

So this debate is essentially whether American women of military age (for men it's currently 18-25) should be subject to military conscription (and thus have to join the register of potential conscripts); currently only ""male persons"" are subject to conscription.

A relevant thing to consider is the 1981 USSC ruling *Rostker v. Goldberg*

I want to disregard the Reddit comments for now, encouraging this type of violence.  I want to talk about this situation in particular.  Obviously I don't condone violence against women, but I want to ask about the merits (or lack thereof) in this video.  I also know that there might be details that aren't seen immediately (e.g. the boy may have actually been the bully, the girl was sticking up for herself, etc.), but I want to take the video at face value as though the title of the video (Girl bullies smaller student, he finally decides he's had enough) were true.

From the look of the video, at least from my perspective, it looks like he's trying to restrain himself from hitting her (until the very end, obviously).  They look to be middle school students, and even though the fight seems to have started before the recording did, the fight goes on for at least thirty seconds and not a single teacher swoops in to break up the fight.  With the girl being noticeably bigger than the boy, besides running away

When I saw the video, I wasn't sure what other choice the boy had in this situation than to take a swing to fend her off.  I felt that if he ran he would only face further bullying, whether it be from the girl or other people for ""having run away from a fight with a girl.""

I saw the SRS thread about [the Olympics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/xeica/if_the_gymnasts_have_undergone_puberty_which_they/) and I am honestly curious about why people think being attracted to anyone under 18 makes you a pedophile. The reasoning behind that view just seems really problematic to me. 18 years is an arbitrary legal definition. So if you're attracted to a person who turns 18 in a day then you're a pedophile one day

It just seems harsh and kind of unrealistic to expect that peoples biological urges will exactly conform to the legal age of consent in their jurisdiction. Personally I think a more useful definition of pedophilia is being attracted to people who haven't gone through puberty because you find juvenile physical features attractive.

I can only speak as a straight man (I don't know if there's a different term I'm supposed to use)

I don't think that makes me a pedophile though. I am attracted to women, but being attracted to a 16 year old because she looks like a 20 year old make you a pedophile?

It totally makes sense that we legally have to set some arbitrary standard

Now he always told be being gay was ok, that she was so aggressive I ""seeked to appease her throbbing dick"".

To him, girls can be bisexual/lesbians, but it's because their sexuality is fluid. Guys? Nah, only gay or straight, he's lying to himself. Genetic/biological causes for homosexuality? Nah

Homosexuality? **Mental illness.** Now this effed with my mind for many months.. I told him: ""but the AMA (american psychological association) ruled that out in the 1970's!"" His response: ""Ohh

I tell him:""Well ""Doctor""

I decided to let it go for a few months. And then the conversation went to me asking him if he thought gays and lesbians could share TRUE, of course, that gays and lesbians having sex is gross and unnatural. Wait.. not lesbians of course ;) , because MY PEEENISS) 

I really wanted to punch him in the face at this point. I mean here was a guy I trusted, etc.. That's the thing isn't it? he's just being a selfish shitlord, not even doing his job right, seeing things from his patient's perspectives etc??

Anyway, being honest he told me yes, but when he started studying medicine, and learning *why* homosexuals are the way they are, he understood and stopped being a homophobe. (Idiot.. there's a difference between empathy and pity)

Onto his sexism (and what I guess is the origin of his shitty attitude against gays). I showed him a recent article in my local newspaper about some 20 local 8-10 yo girls attending a ""one (sexist) woman's conference"" about ""how to be a *lady*"" Topics discussed include: ""What a man expects from a woman"", it is good!!"" my jaw dropped at this point. I ask him if he would want his daughter to attend such a conference and he's like ""Yes. Women have to learn to be **ladies**, it is the only way they'll be happy. I mean have you seen my female patients? How unhappy they are?"" (cue in my deep fear for his patients) ""Men and women have to treat each other differently, it's the key to order and happiness.""

Then he tells me one of his inspiring life stories: ""I was walking in my son's high school the other day

Next session I confront him more about this, ask her if she's not happy"". (I'm like ""holy fuck, holy fuck, who have I been seeing these past 6 years? what is GOING ON!??"") Of course she's going to say she's happy, she grew up in sexist Mexico! That's what she's been taught all her life will make her happy! Because of SHITLORDS LIKE YOU!! ARRGGGH!!!!

Here are the parts that really confuse me, I need your help SRS! I'm really sorry if it offends you I'm confused about this, but I'm learning. I'm a 22 yo (todays my bday!) gay guy who is only recently opening up to the idea of being with women:

He has told me women have this ""instinctive emotionability (?)"", I mean I REALLY want to have children, and if I could I wouldn't work to the point that I'd be with them all day. Thing is, I'm male. When I told him this, he jokingly (or not?) suggested we start hormone therapy. Do you guys think it's true? Women having a ""instinctive emotionability""? Because on my time here in SRS, I think all humans have this, it's just that society has made the male believe such feelings are wrong and should be hidden. Am I right? Is he right?

When I told him about [Andrea Dwrokin's book Intercourse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercourse_\(book\)), this sounds kinda wrong… I'm going to SRSDiscussion."".

So help me SRS. What do you think? What do you women enjoy about sex? Is it really ""feeling whole""? Can't be right

And here's the delicious part: he doesn't believe he's sexist. (Me? Arbitrary, w/family, following the path society places before me, WRONG?? hahaha) No no, he's not the sexist here, *I*, SRS 

I think his veil of shit needs to be raised. He has grown so comfortable living in this sexist mexican society, yet he seems to forget he went to a sexist catholic university in the 1970's.

At the center of their misunderstanding is a grain of truth: there are more white people on welfare in the US than there are people of color. If you're familiar with the history behind the ""white"" identity

A perception I have of many middle-class white progressives is that  we still largely buy into the myth of a monolithic white identity. Scapegoating poor white Southerners as being the real racists is the easiest method of avoiding questions about our own racism. If you really think poor white people are *that* much more racist than we are, because we don't stand to lose anything from doing so. White Southerners really are more openly racist, no one is denying that. But if the people who are most conscious of white privilege are the ones who don't have it, doesn't it make sense that the people who are most conscious of their *own* racism are the ones who benefit the least from it?

Obviously, and in a way this is still the question I present to you all. Making fun of working class white culture is still prevalent among white liberals because we presume the existence of a single egalitarian white culture. Concerns about this are often derailed by (correctly) pointing out their relative acceptance of open bigotry. The dismissal of other white subcultures is often spared the treatment accorded to them by cultural relativity because we aren't considerate of how our socioeconomic class separates us. This is in large part because we directly benefit from ignoring this separation. If you're a white progressive who has ever wondered why the white working class eagerly continues to support a political party that so obviously works against their best interests, consider how your attitude supports the mythology that keeps that phenomenon alive.

Hey SRS. I'm a fucking scumbag. This isn't a circlejerk, has bitched and moaned about how life hard is for white males. Think of any awful shit you've seen here; I didn't write it, but I might as well have. I used to be one of those guys that always shouted ""lol rape,"" even to women. ""lol fag"" to guys. ""lol n-----"" to blacks. I couldn't have been more offensive. I once had a girl take interest in me (what was she thinking? I FUCKING SUCK.) and she confided in me her darkest secret, that she was non-forcibly raped. Since she wasn't tied down, gagged, and murdered, I never believed her. At the end of our relationship I called her out on it. All she could do was cry.


I'm asking for a help, that's me. I've asked people whose family members have died in 9/11 what the ""big deal was."" Also, not only have I seen CP, I've saved and posted some; even worse I've touched myself to it. I mean, I honestly can't think of someone more fucked in the head than I. I've complained about how men are eventually going to be ""taken over"" by women, been Nice GuyTM , learned PUA shitfest techniques


I'm coming to you for change... I don't deserve it, ""Yea, what's wrong with that?"" I've finally come around to being able to manage find poop in the worst of threads, but that's not enough to be able to respect myself.
I'm trying to change, is that I was wondering if there is anything I can read or watch or listen to in order to grow some compassion or decency? I've never hated myself more than in the weeks I've been to SRS, and that's good; I need to change my awful ways. I'm not asking for pity and you can ask me anything and you can benned me and you can hate me, but I needed to post this...

In commemoration of reaching +5000 subscribers (:D!) and due to the higher concentrations of concern trolling we've been seeing here lately (D:)

**What This Is**

Every other week or so (or whenever I feel like we need one) I will be putting up a meta post that will contain

* At least one good exchange/post we've had on Modmail
* Mod concerns over certain topics. Every once in a while (like this week for example) we'll have like 5 different threads on the same topic (rape) and almost all of them are concern trolley. I'll consolidate a mod response to this and link relevant effort posts and discussions from the past to catch everyone to speed.

The comments section is your space to ask questions such as 

* Why was a certain topic removed?
* Why was I/another user warned for this comment?
* What do the mods think of my suggestion X


**What This Is Not**

This space does not mean a relaxation of the rules. All sidebar rules still apply here. Mods will remove derailing comments or comments that don't belong

* Creating an alt to ask why you were banned. Use modmail.
* Meta discussion about SRS. Use /r/SRSMeta
* Demanding/haranguing individual mods to answer your questions when they are in obvious bad faith and
* Trying to start discussions on social justice issues--just use regular SRSD for that.

I can only answer for the mod actions that I've taken myself--other mods may not have the time nor inclination to answer your questions. Don't take this to mean that we're ignoring you. If you have a really pressing question or concern

That being said, this can be an incredibly useful space to you as long as you are humble and approach SRSD as a learning station. If you are a member of a marginalized group, remember that this space is yours to cultivate as well. So onto the actual content!

1337126623.0,tp3a6,Don't atheists have a responsibility to be decent people?,TheBobTalbot,58,16,114,"I've been reading SRSD for a few months now and I have learned quite a bit.  I had previously thought that I had achieved some kind of liberal oneness with the universe but this forum has educated me about how much of a shitlord I was and I'm thankful for that.  I'm not hinting that I want any cookies for meeting the minimum standard of decency

As I have learned more and more here in SRSD

I decided to point this out to the communities I was active in.  I was met, I was called a bigot.  When I pointed out misogyny, I was informed that ""Meredith Brooks reclaimed the word 'bitch' in the 90s"" so I should stop complaining.  I know that Lady Gaga uses it freely and that's fine, because she's reclaiming it.  But if a guy uses it to insult a conservative woman he disagrees with and then the ladies applaud him, isn't that a major issue?  Aren't they supporting the patriarchy?

Long story short

The most bothersome thing of all is that they kept repeating, and NOTHING ELSE.  That they were not required to be progressive.  They were not required to think about racism or sexism.   In fact, I was told that by telling them that they should be more progressive I was trying to spread my own ""religion"".  This notion is abhorrent to me.

Having no religion should make you even more free to examine rational thought and not treat everyone like crap!  How can people just hit each other in the face with a dictionary and say ""Look at the definition of atheism!  There's nothing in there about being a good person!""  

This is a gigantic problem.  How can I combat this?  Am I completely wrong?  Don't atheists have a duty to be more progressive and not cling to the biases of their upbringing?

EDIT: Thank you for the input.  I've learned quite a bit.  You are witnessing a bit of a deconversion.  I'm still an atheist but I'm going to stop thinking that atheism is the answer to all problems...atheists can be terrible people as well and religion (or lack thereof) doesn't automatically lead to enlightenment.

EDIT2: Thank you again.  I'd like to clarify that while I have seen this problem in larger forums like /r/atheism and the National Atheist Party subpages on Facebook, my approach to them was ""I see this issue EVERYWHERE and you guys are no exception, so what is up with that?""  Of course, the reaction was terrible and in retrospect I probably could have approached it differently.  When it all comes down to it, as many of you have pointed out, people may change religious affiliation, but if they were raised to be bigots they may just continue to be bigots.

EDIT3: It has been pointed out that ""decent"" can mean many different things depending on one's system of beliefs.  I am thinking that I probably meant ""progressive"" as in ""do atheists have a responsibility to be more progressive?""

Usually it is in references to cases, but nevertheless

I wanted to get some perspectives from you all on the ways in which the term is problematic and to grasp the scope of the problem. The issues I see are these

1) The term simultaneously stigmatizes and misrepresents mental illness

2) The term is sometimes used to describe women that do not meet the expectations and demands imposed upon them by men.

3) The term is tainted by its frequent and broad use in describing women.

Thoughts? I know that I've seen people write a few times that they also had issues with this word

EDIT: I think another issue of the term is its use as manipulation and enforcement of patriarchal values—this is something I just spent some time writing in the ""sane girlfriend advice animal"" thread

Use of the term ""crazy"" often establishes a group of men as saying ""hey, we'll shower you with attention and praise!"" Even this wouldn't be that bad if there weren't an entire history of societies having this sort of thing on an institutional level, primarily manipulating women to the benefit of men. The other advice animals do not do this. They set up an expectation in the reader, and then play on the reader's expectations with the punch line. The sane girlfriend meme is not funny unless you, on some level, buy into some of these views on women. It's only funny if you read the first line, expect ""oh man, girl wants to have porn sex? epic win!"" Both having that expectation and playing to that expectation are

Sexual interest and emotional attachment are separate but linked phenomena. All people have had some experience with one or the other or both. How you identify on a sexual interest/emotional attachment spectrum is different and separate from your sexual orientation.

Check out this handy-dandy graph: [I will be making a colour-blind friendly version soon.]

Edit: Some people seem confused by the graph so I'll explain. You are supposed to plot yourself on the x and y axis, so it's important to not make assumptions about their preferences for types of sexual activity.) Hope that helps.

[Sexual Interest and Emotional Attachment]( http://imgur.com/YAkfB)

Most people will experience either sexual interest or emotional attachment before feeling both. Primary emotional attachment is the top half of the chart. Primary sexual interest is the bottom half.

**Glossary:**

* Emotional attachment: An emotional connection with another person. It does not have to be romantic or love-based.
* Sexual interest: An erotic attraction toward another person. It does not need to be based purely on sexual intercourse.
* Primary emotional attachment: When emotional attachment is experienced prior to forming an erotic attraction.
* Primary sexual interest: When sexual interest is experienced prior to forming an emotional connection.

* Sexual abstinence: Lack of sexual activity. This may or may not include lack of masturbation.
* Masturbation: Causing sexual pleasure to yourself.
* Monoamory: Fulfilling sexual or romantic desires with one partner. (In the graph this refers to only the sexual aspect)
* Polyamory: Fulfilling sexual or romantic desires with more than one partner. (In the graph this refers to only the sexual aspect)
* Multiamory: Fulfilling sexual desire with more than one person at each encounter.
* Eros: A type of love that is generally characterised as “romantic love” and separate from love derived from other relationships.
* Storge: All love that is not Eros. Most commonly: love for a friend.
* Apatheia: Suppression of emotional attachment. Usually seen as a positive trait. (Think vulcans)
* Dispassion: Absence of emotional attachment. Usually experienced about people unknown to you.
* Misanthropy: Hatred for a person or multiple people. Usually used colloquially to describe hatred for the human race in general.

* Celibacy: Purposefully refraining from sexual activity. This does not preclude the celibate person from engaging in emotional intimacy and is usually seen as a positive trait. It may or may not include refraining from masturbation.
* Autosexual: Sexual desire toward oneself and not others. Edit: It has been pointed out to me that Autosexual can also be a term of sexual orientation towards oneself. It is not on the sexual orientation chart but it should be noted that it can be considered an orientation as well as a sexual preference.
* Serial monoamory: Having multiple partners over a lifetime
* Serial polyamory: Having successive multiple partners over a lifetime

* Demisexual: Emotional attachment of some kind is required to create a sexual interest in another person. See: Primary emotional attachment.
* Casual sex: Eros is not required

**Please note:** Sexuality is fluid and changes over time. There is also a lot of overlap in the sexual activity axis. This graph is meant as a general guideline for understanding sexuality and emotional attachments.
*******************
**Sexual Orientation**

Sexual orientation is on a separate spectrum from the sexuality and emotional attachment chart

Edit: **Read the glossary if the chart is confusing.** If you are still confused ask me a question and I'll try my best to answer it. I purposefully tried to make the chart non-normative

Glossary:

* Gender Identity: How a person identifies on the gender spectrum.
* Unigender: Identifying with one of the genders on either end of the spectrum.
* Genderqueer: Identifying somewhere ~~in between the two ends of the~~ else (oops: sorry:/) on the spectrum. Non-normative gender identity.
* Femme: Presenting with traditionally feminine characteristics. Look up: *Feminine*.
* Homme: Presenting with traditionally masculine characteristics. Look up: *Masculine*.
* Trans\*: Identifying differently on the gender spectrum than what you were assigned at birth
* Cis: Identifying the same on the gender spectrum as what you were assigned at birth.

* Homosexual: Attracted to others of the same gender.
* Heterosexual: Attracted to those of the opposite gender.
* Skoliosexual: Attracted to only those who are genderqueer. (*Be careful using this label
* Bisexual: Attracted to both genders on either end of the spectrum. Critics of this term say that it erases genderqueer identity.

I'm a trans lady pro-dominatrix (I do it for money and for personal recreation.) who has been in the scene for a while. I identify lesbian


**Definitions and Disclaimers:**

A lot of this is anecdotal understandings as someone who has participated in the community for a while. I've observed various sections of most communities

BDSM needs to be defined, this includes anything as simple as handcuffs and riding crops to fullblown lifestyles. The lifestyle tends to include a different S&amp;M, though. Slave and master/mistress.

There is a difference between the terms top and bottom, and the sub is the one that is following orders or not in control of the scene. Slave and master/mistress is similar, but implies permanence or a relationship outside the bedroom. Top and bottom aren't so clearly defined. In BDSM contexts bottom usually refers to the person being tied up. It can also be construed as the person who's being penetrated, which I'll get to in more depth later.

There are also levels of engagement with BDSM. The people who represent the community and talk about it the most often *do not represent the majority of people who participate in BDSM.* The most engaged and into it are different than the people who do it as a mere sex act in the bedroom

I am going to use generalizations and wiggle words. These are all primarily anecdotes and my experiences. If yours different


**Myths and Misconceptions:**

First, hopefully, have an established safe word. That is the limit to their power. The dominant partner is expected to follow those guidelines and stop if the safe word is said. They don't have to. When you are tied up and locked down, you are legitimately helpless and powerless and utterly dependent on your dominant to be trust worthy and to meet the basic guidelines for a minimally decent human being.

What I'm saying is certain dominants will renegotiate scenes in the middle of them and often use coercive tactics to do things beyond the prenegotiated lines. They will prime someone with certain words or actions

Second, their experience is bad, unpleasant, or just really strange to them, so much as they switch entirely to going pure dominant.)

[This is most obvious in Christian Domestic Discipline.](http://christiandomesticdiscipline.com/home.html)

The best people to see this in action with are switches (people who sub and dom/me.) Depending on how a switch's day goes

[\(These next two points deal with something someone has thankfully written on quite well


**In Regards to Women's Sexuality:**

Going back to the earlier comment about how bottom also tends to mean the partner who is penetrated. Aside from the general lesbian erasure and erasure of women who dislike penetration that holds

Oh, but they're noticeably rarers than finding videos and stories of a male dominant orgasming.

The point is that female sexuality is considered vulnerable. Women feeling pleasure is considered showing a sign of weakness. This doesn't hold true to everyone. There are some great dommes who focus on totally removing that idea altogether. You will still see it everywhere though. Dommes usually have to come across as icequeens who are never touched and get off. A popular exception is when a domme uses a sub as a sex toy. Otherwise? It can be pretty rare to see.

A way to cement this is how often you'll see it in popular depictions of lesbians. (Depictions made for male consumption. It holds true less often, stories, and a lot of times with acts. Many lesbian dominatrixes dig the use of strap-ons. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, of course, but it does reflect a rather sexist notion.


**Male Entitlement and Devaluation:**

Specifically

[\(This is talked about more in depth about in that previous link


**Racism and BDSM: **

Something poorly thought about and not often really studied. Race play is a part of BDSM, but I honestly don't know a single person of color who is into BDSM well enough to give an experienced opinion. Google doesn't even provide much. The only thing I can say that I've noticed as particularly striking and interesting is black dominant women often times using race play in a very subversive fashion. There is also plenty of BBC imagery abound, but most of what I've seen seems to appeal to white men with a cuckolding fetish.


**Transsexuality in BDSM:**

This is quite simple. There are transsexual dominants and submissives. It tends to be that their gender status is used as a point of shame within BDSM. It is in fact how I got into BDSM. (And it fucked me up, and plays on certain sexual anatomy being either seen as a sense of strength or a weakness.

The big trans domination sites, as it isn't really all that different in the BDSM communities compared to outside it.

And my other huge concern is that in most cases there is no way to know that the people in the porn movie are all there completely of their own free will (any people appearing in porn, you are watching someone being raped or watching a video posted without consent? 1 out of 1000? 1 out of 100? It just makes me sick thinking of this.

Now, the general consensus is always that *I* have to change, that *I* am somehow wrong and that *all of my feelings are invalid*. It just seems like a huge wave of misogyny, and that my feelings aren't valid because I'm a woman. Basically that I just need to ""grow up"" and deal with the fact that all guys watch porn and I am a freak. I don't think it is fair that just because porn is extremely common that I am automatically in the wrong for having issues with it. So I was hoping I could start a discussion on here about the topic, with hopefully some more balanced and diverse viewpoints and get other people's input on the issue.

**Edit:** First

Secondly, what I was trying to start a discussion on was why shaming women for disliking porn is so prevalent. I gave my feelings as an example to show that women that dislike porn aren't doing it just for no reason. However, some people took this as an argument saying I wanted to discuss whether porn was okay, which was not where I was trying to aim this discussion. It is my fault for not being more clear because I got a little rambly and unfocused in the original post.

So basically, in a relationship or not? And what, if anything can be done about it (not to make everyone stop watching porn, but to make it okay to personally not watch porn, or to tell a person at the start of a relationship that it's important you)?

At the risk of leading the discussion... I know that many people don't enjoy seeing condoms in porn, yes, but some STDs can test negative (including HIV) and there's always that window between exams that exposes actors to danger. Not to mention that making condoms a regular part of porn would go miles in encouraging safe sex practices, which is a net good for public health.

Am I alone? On one hand, and this includes safe sex measures (although your partner does have a say in whether they will consent to your safety measures or lack thereof). On the other, the health risks to porn actors could be minimized by mandating condom use, and it could promote condom usage among the general population who watch porn, and to me, that benefit is substantial.

On Tumblr there is a contingent of what seems to be mostly young white females and the occasional white male who call themselves ""otherkin"". They seem to believe that just as transsexual people are born into a body of the wrong sex, or even have ""headmates"" (mental companions) that are characters from fiction. This idea sounds completely laughable, I know, and at first I thought it had to be some kind of elaborate inside joke, but there were so many blogs that kept up the seriousness so much of the time that I did some Googling and for all the world, it appears that this is a serious belief that some people have.

Now honestly it seems to me that this is a pretty frightening escapist break from reality on the part of some very sheltered kids with way too much Internet access and not enough fresh air. Furthermore, so now they have an Internet circlejerk of their very own calling them special and catering to their weird fantasies. They are honestly trying to claim things like that it's erasing to say ""you are not a fictional troll and you don't have Sherlock Holmes living in your head with you"". Finally, because they are all or mostly white, I can't help but think this is a way to play out the ""exotic oppressed minority"" fantasy that so many whites seem to have without getting called out on it.

I guess my biggest issue is the giant women’s movement that physical self-improvement is “empowering” or “feminist.” I’ve seen and commented on several women on reddit who say things like “I’m getting breast augmentation for MEEE” and are celebrated for it. I feel like this is in direct opposition to feminism. I hear “I am getting bigger boobs because I’m tired of being ridiculed for them being too small. I’m giving up on fighting against the enforced ideal of beauty so I’m just going to conform.” I get that that really is doing something for yourself, then they are giant. So be it. 

I’ve also heard the argument that as long as the woman buys into the unrealistic standard of beauty, personally, do not like my breasts and want to have them removed entirely? Let’s assume that that is my personal interpretation of beauty. It certainly goes against the socially agreed upon standard, and in that case, I would be doing it for myself.

2. Join the military

1. Live in a kind of poverty that would make the poorest Americans welch
2. There is no option 2.  You're stuck in the country that the Americans and other first world nations trashed, they will almost certainly kill you.

My conflicted feelings come from the inference that a person should be capable of ""reading"" non-consent from his partner. It seems unrealistic and unfair.

So I've been thinking of the culture of self pity. Well it's been kinda forced on me. So really

So recently I've lost a few IRL friends over this Chick-Fil-A thing. Well it's not really about Chick-Fil-A

Over the last few weeks I've been in a whirlstorm of a lot of people around me (IRL) defending that chicken joint. I'm sure you've all seen the arguments that come out of this, including myself.

Now I'm sure some of you are ready to attack me for being American-centric. Look, I'm sure your country has no history of anti-GSM rhetoric fueled/caused by religion. Yes, anti-GSM violence and sentiment only exists in America. It's not like there's gangs of Christians going out to murder homosexuals in Africa right now, because some white American pastor told them about the horrible sin of homosexuality and that's all they needed to hear to start killing. Eastern European countries don't have a notable religious population, and even if they did they don't have any history of anti-gay violence. It's not like Moscow police break up gay pride parades because it was deemed ""Satanic."" Latin America is just a wonderland for openly GSM people. Not a single religious demonstration against GSM folk to be thought of. Religious hatred for queers begins and ends at USA's borders, and since you don't live here you have no reason to care. 

First off

So then comes Chick-Fil-A. A guy says that since he has Christian values, not hate people, disagree with homosexuality. And according to a lot of people, disagreeing with homosexuality isn't bigotry. It's just his view, and it's ""just as bad"" for me to call him out for it. Now if this was just one guy saying it, I wouldn't be so pissed. But the fact is, people all around him are tripping over each other rushing to defend this Christian bigot. ""Oh I'm not letting these PC queers stopping me from getting my chicken!"" ""It's his right to say those things! Freedom of speech!"" But almost worse than the hatred is that these bigots expect a pity party for them. I had somebody who I personally considered a friend complain about how he wonders if he'll ever be able to believe that marriage is only for a woman and a man without being called homophobic. He went on to post links about ""homosexual culture and agenda"" and the threat we pose to society. And of course, and oh how the masses swooned about how brave they were. Conservatives mocked gays for ""being surprised"" that he's anti-gay, I say nothing. I can't. I don't say anything, that placement? A Mormon run institution where the people who were paid to bring me out of my depression constantly made violent gay jokes. That preached about how homosexuality is a choice and to be one you are just acting out on your depression. That your depression can be cured by just not being gay. That to graduate from the program you needed to renounce atheism and homosexuality to find God. You want to know the funny part? My story isn't rare. If I asked you the name of that one GSM youth who was bullyed to the point of suicide by Christians
 
Whenever I bring this up
Look Christians, and the support for that suddenly dropped when they found out that it went to (GASP!) ISLAMIC schools? Do you think that shit would have flown if you didn't dominate the power structure? The worst oppression you'll ever face being reminded of my own oppression. You are so used to having everything being made to pander to you, the slightest infraction makes you think you know just what it's like to be the other. If being reminded of what your religion means to a lot of people bugs you, you might want to go to a more Christian positive space. May I suggest ""almost anywhere else?"" Because if you've never been to almost anywhere else, it's really pro-Christian. You'll find that in almost anywhere else, you dominate the power structure. I know it must be hard to only have almost anywhere else to run to, but you'll manage. 

Oh sorry

Christian bars get shut down and run out of town because of concerned GSM groups.

Every politician with a serious campaign for president this year is queer

If any Christian appears on a TV show

Christian public figures have to hide their Christianity for years

Christian rights groups get death threats from GSM folk

When Christians get bullied at school

I should say that if you are Christian and your response to this isn't defensive anger, I'm on your side. But if your response is still defensive anger, I'm not going to coddle you, and I'm not sorry for my stance.

It's not just a Christian thing. Far from it. It's all of the ruling groups. It's the white people who honestly think cracker is comparable to *insert racial slur* in offense.

1325268985.0,nwh9k,'Feminism helping men?' - why asking this question implicitly keeps an unhelpful gender binary alive.,RogueEagle,49,10,70,"Actually the subreddit [which is a highly politicized attempt to send the message that nothing feminism has done helps men] awkwardly brings up a really good point. What does it mean to 'help men?'

Personally,' as individuals.  I'm out to deconstruct the models in our society that construct a false gender binary which constrains men and women into rigid roles in society. The best way I can think of (and only obstacle) to this is to enable or society to truly value incarnations of 'the feminine' in society - including notably their expressions by men.

Everything I do towards this goal helps some men, because there is nothing that 'all men' want, except the freedom to decide for themselves.

So **feminism helps every man** who struggles to learn what toxic gender roles do in society and **it helps every woman** to do the same.   Feminism can help any person who would shoulder its cross.

The biggest point remaining is that feminism doesn't *create* these problems in our society. It shines a light into dark corners. It doesn't create a behavior just to criticize it.  It criticizes behaviors that are already there.  Feminism illuminates the problems and gives us tools to fix them.   

I contrast this to the List of Grievances listed in the MR sidebar.  I would consider most of these(false rape accusation aside) to be symptomatic of larger societal problems.  Light happens to *already* fall on these problems

Most of all, can see that helping women, and valuing women, is helping men value more things about themselves and allows *everyone* to explore a full range of human capacities instead of keeping some behavior exclusively for 'men' or 'women.'

On Monday a female fighter named Fallon Fox disclosed that she is transgendered *after* knocking out her opponent via knee to the head in 39 seconds. She s the first trans* fighter on record to compete in sanctioned MMA fights. As an aside for those who don't know, perform random drug testing and handle fighter weigh-ins as well as a myriad of other things revolving around fighter safety and fight regulations.

Fallon underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2006 along with the supplemental hormonal therapy and she had her first [fight in 2013 which she won via armbar in the 1st round.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O63KAKFPC7g)

As you would expect, someone who went through puberty and early adulthood as a man. As these people are fight fans and not medical professionals, there is some debate as to whether this fact makes no difference, some difference or all the difference in the world when fighting in a cage. The admin of a respected MMA message board posted the following:

*The ABC has very stringent standards for licensing transgendered fighters. They was a very detailed presentation at the 2012 convention in FL. I forget all the protocols

*Dr. Sherry Wulkan did the presentation

Here is the [Sports Illustrated story](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mma/news/20130305/fallon-fox-transgender-mma/) and here is the [thread on a popular fight forum](http://www.mixedmartialarts.com/mma.cfm?go=forum.posts&amp;forum=1&amp;thread=2142727&amp;page=1). So now the discussion. I am looking for opinions on the following issues: 

- Even if she was not *required* to disclose her trans* status in her first two fights do you think she should have? 
- If you were a highly trained female fighter do you feel it would make a difference if your opponent was biologically a man until early adulthood?
- Does she benefit from an unfair advantage? 
- If she is denied a license to fight in the future is it due to bigotry against trans* individuals or protecting female fighters from certain harm?

1331325636.0,qpcyl,"On the Proper Usage of terms ""Racism"" and ""Racist""",Willrich354,58,16,97,"I want to discuss two words

I’m start with the term racism because by understand racism properly we can better understand what counts and don’t count as “racist”. At its core racism is a SYSTEM of oppression that’s based on class divisions based on (pseudo) physical appearance or ethnic origin. I put an emphasis on system because many people tend to forget that racism isn’t an idea/ ideology in so much as its a social construct. We have to look at it in a similar way to capitalism. Capitalism has the state, media and language that props it up and prevents its abolishment. Racism also has these institutions that prop it up and protect the system and in the US they are very much entwined with capitalism’s tools (a result of racism modern birth out of the profit motive).

Along with the above point if we are going to deal with racism and destroy it, which are racists, still exist. The language of black vs white, nigger/a, and other slurs still exist. Being nice to one another does little to gain power for those of us who want to actually take down the system which create material and political disadvantage for people of color. Now let me qualify all of this paragraph by saying that it’s of the utmost necessity to deal with racist ideas in ourselves and those around us but I’m only saying that this work is only one piece of the puzzle.

The last thing I want to say on this topic is that racism, courts, soldiers, police, etc) to protect itself not because people agree with it, although in many ways this also serves as power.

Now that we have set the groundwork with dealing with the term racism, or an institution, as exhibiting behavior that furthers or reinforces the system of racism. Now, I mentioned in the sentence between this paragraph and the previous one that racism depends on power to survive, well racist acts and institutions serve as that power putting people of color back in their place. I put an emphasis on power because many people call actions racist that are not actually racist. They may be reflective or a reaction to a racist ideology but they in of themselves are not racist.

Examples of this mix-up is when dealing with black people saying for instance “I hate white people, and I will say that although it is indeed unproductive, it is in no way analogous to a white person saying the same thing about black or other people of color. They have a whole society with 500 years of experience to back their hatred. That’s power and that’s racism. Unfounded statements about a group of people made by an individual is prejudice more so than racism.

Related to the previous point, and ways of being that further that system’s goal. In the case of racism, everything in American society (not to say any other country is absolved of this) is tainted in the racist system and it’s ideologies and language. So when someone says something like “black people are lazy”, they are being racist but at the same time everything we do is bathed in racist ideologies anyways. By that token we can call anyone racist really but the difference between something truly racist and something that's just ignorant is that the racist vs the ignorant person will say something like that to preserve their real or perceived privilege aka preserve the racist system. To realize that is to realize how much work it takes to not only destroy the system but also the simple act of converting someone over to the anti-racist struggle. People do many things that are racist and prejudiced and not even know it and that is an important point to remember as anti-racist activists. 

The Take Away:

    * Racism is not an idea but a system of oppression like capitalism and thus exist on material terms vs ideological terms
    * Racism depends on power to survive and getting people to not think racist is part of that but it’s not a complete solution
    * To constitute being racist or racism an action or person must have power to back up their disdain for the person their hatred is aimed at
    * Hatred of others that lacks power constitutes prejudice
    *  Knowing these simple facts will keep people from putting the anti-racist struggle in the wrong place (it’ll wither away after we destroy capitalism) and dealing with people correctly that we are trying to convert (racism is invisible to most white people)

[EDIT] a few random bits of the piece that seemed a little vague and altered the intro. I want to expand this so we can use it as a way cor people not really acquainted with racism or race period to navigate these ideas which are admittedly hard for some to grasp.

When I was a boy in Greek public schools in the 90s, for the Greek society, an extremely obscure hobby - computers and particularly video games.  Whereas everyone else was talking about football or, later on, girls, I had only interest in discussing Monkey Island and Mortal Kombat. That was likely caused and exaggerated by my family moving around a lot and thus me changing schools every 3 years, thus not having any close friends. (There were other things that likely inflamed this but I don't want digress in my personal sob story :) )

As a result, but in Gymnasium/Lucaeum (i.e. school for ages 12-18, what I guess you Yanks call ""High School""?) it escalated to physical bullying.

It started with a single slap on the back of the head, and in my attempt to fit in the new school, I tried to ignore it. This was my first mistake. From then on, I was the slap-target. 

This spread and soon other teenagers started making fun of everything about me. I would come to class to find caricatures of me on the drawing board. People throw stuff at me during lessons, try to slap me etc etc. And this wasn't one or two people. It was not even only my whole class. It was practically all classes in my age bracket. It got really really bad.  

I don't know why or how. But I always had a very defiant personality, I stood my ground. Most often than not, this escalated into fights. I would literally have multiple fights per month. My one-year-older sister used to joke that I fought half the kids in school. Sometimes I initiated the fight when I had too much. But most often than not, I managed to goad them into attacking me first.

I don't know if my defiance to take bullying passively helped or not

It is because of these experiences, to degrees that easily challenge physical damage. It took me years to overcome the distrust and introversion I built because of it. It is because of this that I do not believe violence is out of the question as a response. One always has the right to self-defense to avoid being hurt. And if causing physical harm is enough to stop receiving emotional harm, I don't see why it shouldn't be on the table.

Of course we're talking about imperfect scenarios here. We're not talking about a working system where bullying is likely stopped by teachers or other students. We're talking about the usual situation where teachers are unlikely to care or act appropriately

Note that I'm not supporting the act of the kid in the OP. I can however understand it because I've gone nuclear once or twice in my life after persistent bullying. I don't know the specifics of the situation,,False,,t5_2t5sa,True,,True

This got me to thinking a bit

First, most stem from ethnicity. Nazi (my German heritage, it doesn't *only* apply to men, but I've never heard a woman called it due to her heritage, so just going off my own personal experiences) Kike (my Jewish heritage, the irony is not lost on me, this one may also be a wash, I've heard a pair of women talking about me who thought no one could hear them comment on how I looked like a rapist

I've experienced prejudice like this and more that isn't just limited to white men (don't get me started on how many times I've casually mentioned I don't believe in god and seen the person I was talking with visibly shrink away and give me a frightened look). I don't want to try to play oppression olympics so I won't compare it to anyone else's experiences with dealing with prejudice, yeah, it freaks me out a bit, because for some reason I imagine they *know* that I own a menorah and they're going to mess me up.

I think it's fair to say *everyone* has experienced some form of discrimination, or to be more thick-skinned. Or even just have your experiences dismissed out of hand.

This is where privilege comes in.

The following is a generalization

Many times I see privilege used, their pain is called meaningless and insignificant.

And they aren't. No one in the world has absolute privilege. Everyone has had to deal with some form of shaming

So does ""privileged"" really stand up to many other slurs? Not really

I don't want to post on my main account due to the fact that I'm ashamed to admit feeling this way and I don't want any of my friends who post here a lot to judge me for it. 

For the past few months, someone comes along and makes an extremely racist/sexist/etc. post or comment that gets a billion upvotes and a ton of people agreeing with them. For example, that video about men being thinkers and doers while women just vent instead of solving their problems. I knew the comments would be shit, but I read them anyways, and as usual it was filled with people who honestly believe that shit.

I get tired of seeing threads upvoted that involve men stereotyping women, just... I'm too worn to even type it out. I just get damn sick of reading and hearing about how men can't be stereotyped yet women are stereotyped all the time.

I get tired of all the rape jokes and sexual remarks that reddit likes to spew every time there is a post involving a woman. I get tired of every time there is a thread involving a black person who has committed a crime

These are just a few things. I know pretty much everyone here hates it. But lately it seems like it has gotten worse

Offline life isn't any easier; it's actually worse. At least online

It's not like I bash my friends or think I'm above them. I 100% don't! I also understand that people can't change their habits overnight, I was very frustrated over having to change my vocabulary. Of course, over time it's like anything, it's a habit now and I can't see any other way to think or act. I mention this, because when I talk to my friends or strangers, if they say something sexist that is normally considered 'okay' by most people, I don't get mad at them and give them a lecture, they are just

That being said... it doesn't make hearing or seeing their racist, I didn't give them a lecture, but I guess something subtly gave away that I found their talk uncomfortable. And unlike the Internet, I can't just take my time to write out a thoughtful reply with sources if need be. I'm on the spot and put in an awkward position of trying to inform my friends without making them think I dislike them or I'm better than them. What ends up happening is I maybe get one point across, but it's so jummbled that it gets lost and I am disregarded.

I know a lot of people will just tell me I don't need them. But the problem is, but we all need human interaction. And most of these people are great, and nice, and I know they would never intentionally want to be sexist/racist/etc.

I feel like no one likes to invite me to things or be around me because they are afraid of offending me. And I understand that feeling. There is a woman I am friends with who is extremely religious while I am not. I don't judge her for her religion, for example). So, I can totally get why anyone would not want to hang out with me. Who wants to hang out with someone who might get offended over...well, anything (even tho that's not even true, that's just what they think)?

As a result, and I feel like no matter what I do, I'm fighting a losing battle. I feel like I need to choose between pretending to believe and be someone I'm not, or be alone while fighting a battle that seems to be losing its footing more and more each day. I can't just give up my morals and beliefs and go back to how I was. I just simply can't, it's way too ingrained and would feel like (I imagine) someone who is gay pretending to be straight just to please their parents.

I know this is bad thinking, and no amount of downvotes or negative comments could bring me down. I looked *forward* to challenging people's views and changing their minds. Now? Shit, I can barely muster up enough energy to write out a paragraph, and lately I will just flat out ignore anyone who comments to me rather than reply and try to educate them.

Views that were critical of US foreign policy were decried as somehow being automatically problematic. There is a failure to realise that being born in the west, of imperialism. Particularly in the anglophone west

At it's core, that all others are like them until proven otherwise. I have seen an astonishing number of people, all across SRS, automatically assume that another poster is just like them. This assumption doesn't just run to the fact that the other poster is from the west, on SRS. It almost always seems to be the assumption that the other person is from the US as well. Not just in specific cases, but in general. People from the US may make up the majority of this site's demographics, but I suspect so do white men, which is pretty high up there with the US in the imperialist privilege stakes, say

I would be interested on hearing if any other SRSers have noticed this, am not always perfect at it by a long shot, but I do make an active effort to improve (much in the same way many of us struggle to fully remove ableism, say, from our language and thinking). There are specific language constructs we can look at. For example, one thing I always try to be sensitive of is referring to people from the US as 'Americans' and the USA as 'Americans', as I've spoken with quite a few people from central and south America who find this offensive and erasing. I wonder if some, might find the term 'western' offensive,,

I'm also a white woman with what is most likely one of the whitest USA/European genealogies (white north american colonists

Background: I'll be honest

 I googled people's responses to the end of the world thing and found some articles about both people trying to dispel the ""end of the world"" belief and people who believe in it where the groups were dismissive and marginalizing towards the Mayan people and their culture.

The first thing I read up on Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's tweets that hand-waved the entirety of Mayan culture which are showcased [here](http://www.racialicious.com/2012/12/05/starcrossed-dr-neil-degrasse-tysons-bizarre-anti-mayan-rant/) which culminates with him saying &gt; "" Hard to take seriously predictions about the end of the world from the Maya, because the Mayans are still here today, the idea they just ""mysteriously disappeared"" is totally made up. Also he says that the Mayans actually created a prophecy that the world would end in 2012 which is also not true, it's just the end of a calendar. I love Dr.NDT as much as any redditor but he should have at least looked into the issue more before saying anything.

The blog also points out [this rather damning article](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/24/mayan-demand-an-end-to-2012-doomsday-myth/) which states that the some of the leaders of the Mayan people are opposed to the ""end of the world"" festival beacuse it is both disrespectful of Mayan culture and a cash grab. &gt;The Culture Ministry is hosting a massive event in Guatemala City — which as many as 90

&gt;Maya leader Gomez urged the Tourism Institute to rethink the doomsday celebration

I'd love to hear what SRSdiscussion thinks about these issues. Do you think we'll be seeing more things like the 2012 apocalypse phenomenon where the western world focuses on the beliefs of other cultures? Does the connectivity provided by the internet have anything to do with this? How does this compare to other questionable aspects of new-age spirituality like the appropriation of the customs of other native peoples? Will the mainstream media ever pick up on issues like this instead of just generating hype?

I was reading this book because I saw a review of a different book about the same author on a panel book show. Basically the whole panel hated the book apart from one who was arguing that the author made such horrible women characters for equality reason

""That night at the Brooklyn party, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, drinks cheap beer, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead

Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because ‘I like strong women’ is code for ‘I hate strong women.’)

I waited patiently – years – for the pendulum to swing the other way, pretend to love cosmos, organize scrapbook parties, and make out with each other while we leer. And then we’d say, Yeah, he’s a Cool Guy.

But it never happened. Instead, then there was something wrong with you.

But it’s tempting to be Cool Girl. For someone like me, I knew immediately that was what he wanted, and for him, I guess I was willing to try. I will accept my portion of blame. The thing is, I was crazy about him at first. I found him perversely exotic, a good ole Missouri boy. He was so damn nice to be around. He teased things out in me that I didn’t know existed: a lightness, a humor, I walked barefoot, I was living in the moment

a) a one-upping, or shitthatneverhappened.txt stories, *or*

b) a hateful environment

Neither of these two 'environments' are the result of a level-headed

###Superiority

The pissing contests and the ""taking down a notch"" are very commonly seen in most traditional

&gt; ""Oh you bench 100kg? I bench 120kg.""

&gt; ""Just 120kg? lol I bench 6 tonnes.""

&gt; ""I could do 6 tonnes with [MY PENIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/mypenis).""

And so on. This is also behavior shown by elitist people

It's either

&gt; ""I'm so much better than you at this game.""

Or

&gt; ""You suck at this game.""

So the way Reddit acts can be read as them feeling superior to others and trying to remind everyone

Do they feel better than everyone else in real life and translate those feelings to Reddit?

###Inferiority

Feelings of inferiority in real life fall apart when hiding behind the mask of anonymity and sometimes

It is common for people that have failed in various areas of life to lie about what they accomplished when thrust into a community which will never verify those statements. 

Never picked up a single weight in your life? No worries: everyone here benches a comet before breakfast.

I actually had a friend whom I'd never seen with a woman. EVER. In three years. And I used to see him every weekend. But he kept telling me that he'd had sex with 300 women over the years I'd known him just because

I feel that this can explain much: A Redditor feels wronged by a woman and gets online to shit on some woman for having pointy elbows. A Redditor is picked on by some guy who's bigger than him and gets online to tell everyone that his penis is bigger than everyone else's.

So

Do they carry their feelings of superiority and elitism to Reddit from their own life

Or do they act the way they do as an over-compensated reaction to being cast out from social groups

A father Jamie Rohrs ran out off the theater left his girlfriend Patricia Legarreta and 2 children behind. he  came back when his girlfriend called him. Their is public outrage for Jamie Rohrs actions and some people are calling for his girlfriend not to marry him because he would not be a good ""protector"" and put his live on the line to save her. 

  Another man(complete stranger) Jarell Brooks shielded patricia legarreta and her 2 children with his body and got them out of the theater. In the process he was shot in the thigh. Is this type of behavior in men socialized? or is it just what the media focuses on?

1339592448.0,uzqre,A few questions on ableism,imsometueventhisUN,37,1,95,"[I posted this as a comment on SRS in reply to a mention of ableism

I'd only heard of ableism once, I must admit, given the person's sense of humour, I thought they were being facetious, and thought no more of it.
Having read this comment and looking into it a little (note: a little further! As in, either through your own interpretation or by recommending further reading.

Wikipedia states that the ableist world view is 'that the able-bodied are the norm in society, a ""bad"" thing that must be overcome. The ableist worldview holds that disability is an error, a mistake, or a failing, rather than a simple consequence of human diversity, akin to race, ethnicity

Ok

* 1.The able-bodied are the norm in society
* 2. [EDIT: I've learnt from replies that this was not what I meant
* 3. Disabled people should be kept at a distance from able-bodied people
* 4. A disability is a ""bad thing"" that must be overcome
* 5. Disability is an error/mistake/failing.


1. I must admit, it probably is. Just another sign that ableism (as here described) is widespread and ingrained!

2. Maybe I'm unaware of my own prejudices, something that makes you less able than otherwise. By contrast with, say, the statement ""people who are over a certain weight should strive to lose weight"" (which is complicated by the fact that people have different ""natural"" weights, influenced by genetic factors, and so there's no single ""healthy"" BMI for the whole population), there is absolutely nothing to be gained by not addressing and attempting to overcome a disability. The converse of this statement seems to be suggesting that people should not use reading glasses, insulin shots

3. Dear God I hope that people believe this and this is just being used as a straw man argument. I fear I may be wrong.

4. See point 2. If it's not a bad thing, but rather the disability - if the characteristic isn't a bad thing, why is it called a disability?

5. This strikes me as emotive language. Technically, etc., but that doesn't imply fault or wilful negligence on their part. Again, I think I'm misunderstanding the terms, so I'd appreciate some guidance from someone who knows more about this subject.

For clarity: I'm not suggesting that ableism is a good thing, I don't think that I know what ableism is. I'm stating that the description that I've read on Wikipedia isn't wholly bad, which leads me to believe that I've misunderstood the description, and asking for clarification.

So for a very long time I was under the impression that I could limit what some would consider offensive humor to my very close friends. I at least knew they would not take it seriously. My best friend is gay and he has always made it clear that he does not find any type of gay jokes offensive (as a precaution I never make the same type of jokes in front of any of his boyfriends of the past bc I don't know their experiences and I would definitely not want to offend them).

So I was content to go along with my life making offensive jokes as long as I knew that none of my close friends would see it as some sort of truth. But recently, and I realized that I would often make (now that I look back on it) very offensive and possibly homophobic jokes. I would use the F word with my roommate and make gay jokes quite often bc that is what I was used to with most of my friend.

My roommate hasn't indicated that he was offended by any of these actions, he might actually be hurt by some of my words and actions. So, am I just a complete piece of shit? Should I apologize or not? Considering that he has not indicated that he took any offense to anything I said in the past.

I've really been trying to change for quite a while. I've been able to change my misogynistic attitudes over the last 6 months and I've been able to eliminate a lot of slurs from my vocabulary (mainly thanks to SRS).

A few weeks ago there was a discussion about what to say to someone you possibly acted shitlordy to. I find myself in the opposite situation.

I attended a rather small primary school (18 people in my year!), fat child who also happened to have (and still do thank you genetics) essential tremors, which amongst other things cause involuntary movement of the body. 

Now growing up I was incredibly self aware of all these things so as much as I could tried to mask them eg not drinking in front of other people

Except for one guy

Sneak up behind me and grab me

Sit behind me in assembly and poke me in the side

Show me up in front of the girls in the class

He sometimes physically beat me but that was rare

General snide comments, maybe you should be at shurbern school you'd fit in more (it's a school for people with special educational needs)

So at the end of year 6

Finally it came to ahead on the school bus home where no teachers were there to stop him

And at 11 years old

My father is disabled. He had a stroke when I was 4 years old and lost brain function (which of course Richard mocked often). As a result we had a lot of pills in the house. In hard to reach areas obviously, big ugly pink things) because there was a story line on a soap my mum watched where someone did similar.

I knew what the result would be

Fast forward: I'm 22

However the other week I saw him and it all came back to me. The nights spent crying

So i want to write a letter to him, and how the person I could have been will never be because of him. I don't want to be angry I just need closure.

I've been reading a lot of things about rape lately, partner said no, person went ahead and kept pressing/did it anyway, partner didn't really resist or do anything about it, but the non-consent was (from what I could tell) already established. It seems pretty clear that the person understood either in the middle or afterward that this was a rape. Where it's freaking me out is that I've had this happen to me, a couple times. Where I've said no, I'm tired or don't want to and my boyfriend just keeps pushing and pushing. It's always made me feel shitty/angry afterward, more than rape, he listened for a while

Anyway, but I don't know if I would necessarily classify it as rape myself, however, at the same time, the lack of respect to my own wishes and going ahead and doing it anyway also made/makes me feel violated and angry and shitty. But, I also didn't push him away or anything. Even when I talked to him about it, he justified it by saying sometimes I just needed a push - and didn't think anything was wrong with that. On the other hand

A note: Please don't argue about legal bullshit here. I really don't give a flying fuck about it. I know the law

EDIT: Having received a number of responses about what I think about it

1326995660.0,onjiv,Privilege and how it affects humor.  ,moonmeh,42,6,57,"So I've been thinking about this issue for quite a while now as I realize the dichotomy of being able to laugh at completely tasteless jokes or jokes that involve demeaning words and realizing that it's completely wrong and criticize others for making the joke. 

It's not quite lack of empathy but because I have never been at the end of the stick with those words. I've been privileged enough where my asian/korean ethnicity was never a major problem and the racist comments were often in good humor. I never been raped. I never been molested. I haven't lost family members to various types of disasters. I have been privileged enough that because the community was so accepting that I've never seen the end result of a serious hate crime or bullying.

All this leads me to believe that because I'm not personally invested in many of the comments I can laugh at them or make special snowflake comments at people being offended by Asian jokes (though I stopped that now). I recognize the hypocrisy of not being able to laugh at Korean colonization or jokes made about rape of nanjing but it furthers my idea that personal investments makes a great difference in one's ability to laugh at things.

It's hard to reconcile with sometimes as I know I should not find it funny but I find myself laughing at 
[a joke using the word faggot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCIWsfPxJ2k)

At this point I've resigned myself to appreciate that at least I understand why the jokes are offensive to some and have tact not to go spouting it over public places like a dysfunctional water fountain. 

Sorry if I'm writing the really obvious in a really long and obtuse way. But what do you people think of the idea that privilege directly plays a role in how one is able to take a joke/statement and laugh or be offended?

I recently took a course at my University called History of Espionage, any discussions of European or American colonialism on North America tends to portray the Native Americans as if they just passively awaited everything that happened to them, rather than actively participating in their own history.

**TLDR**: I'd like to discuss white privilege's role in the history we learn.
___
Now, this is just my own contribution to this discussion.

Typically, they were Europeans, what other reason did he need?

The actual story, but he had been previously captured by the Europeans, enlaved (during which time his original nation was wiped out by diseases the Europeans had been carrying), and then captured by the Wampanoag, the nation that *was* local to that area. The Wampanoag were in very poor shape by this point; they too had been ravaged by European diseases, but their population had stabilized before they were wiped out entirely by them. Problem was, their neighbor nation the Narragansett

It was around this time that the Mayflower touched down at Plymouth, recognized an opportunity when he saw one. He decided to ally himself with Plymouth, but here is the interesting part: it wasn't to make the Wampanoag stronger militarily. Rather, it was because the Narragansett were already trade partners with the English, and Massassoit gambled (correctly) that they would not risk endangering that partnership by attacking another group from England. 

That's right

Anyway, and his ally Samoset knew only a smattering. So they were forced to turn to their captive, Tisquantum, even though they did not trust him, because he had learned fairly fluent English while he was enslaved. So they used him as an interpreter, a deal was brokered, Thanksgiving was born

Most history books stop there, Tisquantum began going out of his way to ingratiate himself to the English so that they would begin to expect him to be with them more often, and so he had a reason to be away from the Wampanoag who still considered him their captive. Once his own place was secure, he began feeding the Puritans lies about Massassoit: he doesn't like you, he is plotting against you, he wants you all dead, he plans to attack you. Because the English trusted him so much, which made the Wampanoag ill at ease and so *they* began preparing for war. It was essentially a Cold War

That's some Game of Thrones level shit

The other significant Native American we learned about was Pocahontas, I recommend that everyone here read ""Pocahontas: Medicine Woman, Spy, Entrepreneur, Diplomat"" by [Paula Gunn Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Gunn_Allen). I cannot recommend this book enough.

Now, she was a medicine woman (John Smith assumed she was the chief's daughter because why else would he listen to a woman?). Pocahontas was her childhood name; by the time the Europeans arrived, she was known as Matoaka. She did not ""save"" John Smith because he was not going to be killed; he was at a ceremony that certainly would have *looked* like an execution, but it was not, it was simply a way of integrating Smith (and therefore Jamestown) into the chiefdom (which, by the way, was actually a collection of communities that were collectively called the tsenecommocaw, she staged her own capture (and it had to be her because she was already held in high regard by the English because of John Smith) so that she could more effectively spy on the English and pass information back to the tsenecommocaw (EDIT: Or so Gunn Allen believes, when she actually had *much* more agency than we gave her credit for.

Another, that that is all Rolfe is known for nowadays, because he was *extremely* important to European history. You see, before coming to America, Rolfe had somehow managed to procure Spanish Tobacco seeds, and with the tsenecommocaw's help (and Pocahontas's in particular), he manged to blend it with American tobacco and make a variant that was reportedly so amazing it broke Spain's economic stranglehold on England.

1325535985.0,o04z9,Thoughts on tone argument,3DimensionalGirl,40,8,54,"So

I have reservations about tone argument because I want to believe that there are people who genuinely want to learn who are then sworn at and told off without being given the benefit of the doubt.  I don't think swearing and anger should be the first response to a politely worded, I worry that it feeds into the ""You're just looking to get offended"", ""Hysterical woman"", ""Angry black man"" type of thinking.  I don't like to seem as though I'm proving the bigots right to those lurking/reading.  I'd rather the bigot look like the unreasonable one.  

HOWEVER, and it usually happens after the person being accused of ""being too angry"" is driven to anger through obtuse arguing and trollish comments.  It has happened to me before.  I try very, very hard to explain calmly and rationally why something upsets me, and after repeating the same talking points five times and getting nowhere, I do start to resort to anger, frustration, and swears.  And when someone then comes back with, why are you so mad?  You need to calm down.  I'm just asking a question""

Basically

I think tone argument makes the most sense when someone is criticizing someone's blog post as being ""too angry"" or ""maybe if you hadn't used the word 'fuck' so much

Basically, otherwise how will their opinions change?  Or the opinions of people on the fence who are just reading the conversation.  But on the other hand, it's not the minority's job to educate everyone on all these issues either.  And they have every right to get upset and swear and tell people to fuck off if they want to.  I guess that I believe tone argument has a time and place.  In SRS proper, it's all about the jerk and complaining about tone would not be taken seriously, but here on SRSD, we do try to respond rationally and calmly to posters so I think we would have the right to call out someone using loaded language.

I, non-distruptive behaviour. My mother was abusive, and I am slightly autistic, and the result was a slightly neurotic, depressed child who was afraid of expressing emotion. Despite the fact that I never once had a violent outburst, my behaviour was seen as ""suspicious,"" and so I was given the full treatment. The experience galvanized me and turned me into a Youth Rights advocate at the age of 11 - and some social workers, tried to help me

So, the same invalidating, abusive behaviours continue against children in supposedly ""mainstream"" institutions (like our public schools)  on a daily basis. I often imagine what kind of abuse a child who is slightly 'different' is faced with, even to this day, as I pass by any primary school I come across - including the institution that I was at, which continues to run with even greater capacity than before. 

Youth Rights is a Feminist issue because it is directly involved with ageism and ableism - adults oppressing children, are the tip of the iceberg, and primarily concern children of Western, white descent, as those tend to be the types of people who seek out psychiatric treatment at a young age. 

I only hope that the discussion enlightens a lot of you to the systematic abuse children face in our Western society.

In a patriarchal culture like the one we live in, it's very hard for a male to be highly skinny, as they're not seen as contributing to typical cultural standards of masculinity, the stereotypical buff ""manly man"".

&gt;I don't know whether anybody's told you this or not, let me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice: The SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds of important ways. Some of these differences are grammatical — for example, double negatives are OK in Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE and SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different ways. Other differences have more to do with style — for instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot more subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences, and it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas, and, writing that doesn't do this is ""choppy."" There are tons of differences like that. How much of this stuff do you already know? [STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on ""I know from the grades and comments on my papers that English profs don't think I'm a good writer.""] Well, ""Incorrect conjugation"" or ""Comma needed"" instead of ""SWE conjugates this verb differently"" or ""SWE calls for a comma here.""

My ask has some background. First consider this (NSFW/TW) Don't Flop battle feat [Lunar C &amp; Matter vs Eddie P &amp; Frisko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtBUnpaWfRw) in which they say all kinds of outlandish, there's little else going on! Note also that there's very few women around in the audience.  In the context of Salman Rushdie's famous [Is Nothing Sacred?](http://www.beartronics.com/rushdie.html) essay from 1990, he argues for a privileged art space (in his case, he's only arguing for literature and specifically novels, but you get the point) where the sacred should not hold sway, and censure should not fall on those who offend the sacred.  With little extrapolation, we can substitute all kinds  of identity offence into the thought experiment in place of blasphemy.

Are there any safe public spaces for potentially offensive communication? What if everyone there knows what they are ""signing up for"" and pre-emptively agrees to take it in good humour?

Continuing with the hip hop theme

&gt;I'm like a head trip to listen to
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. 
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all 
and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all

I frequently find myself saying some pretty horrific violent stuff at the telly - usually when confronted by the worst excesses of reality cringe, because there's zero chance I would ever do these things if given the opportunity. Eminem's point (well made) is that we all have the capacity and propensity for hateful communication, but that we largely do it in private.  Furthermore, to only do it in private is hypocrisy and cowardice, and we should at least have the courage of our convictions and say it publicly.

But then, because the public audience, in contrast with the private audience in my home, do not know me well enough to know that this is hyperbolic venting with no intent to act. There's also the risk that my venomous diatribe might convince some unstrung beau to act in my words in the mistaken belief this is my desire.

For example, we all remember [Gabrielle Giffords](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8248267/American-congresswoman-Gabrielle-Giffords-shot-in-head.html).

So
* Are there art forms (like battle hip hop) where normal rules about what is ""beyond the pale"" should be suspended?
* Is it acceptable to articulate sentiments in circumscribed company that would clearly be offensive in public earshot?
* Is it hypocritical? Should one be willing to say before the world that which one would whisper to the wife? 
*(alliteration was the impetus rather than gender normative precepts here!)*

Additional thoughts
* Is there a material difference between saying something and posting it
* Does one's responsibility to articulate acceptable

1331246083.0,qnz0f,"[Effort] Kony2012, Imperialism, and the White Man’s Burden",Willrich354,43,24

If you have been on Twitter or Facebook you have probably seen some post, LRA, and the campaign to take him out (led by Obama militarily and Invisible Children socially) into its proper context.


President Obama on October 15th last year, told America and the world that it was going to send 100 US soldiers and advisers to Uganda to help fight Kony and the LRA. This act was seen along with the Libya intervention as the first real push for humanitarian military intervention since the Clinton era. Along with that announcement within a few days he also authorized military action in the Central African Republic, Congo, Kenya,and Somalia, for similar stated reasons.

5 months later and we see Invisible Children, and this video to drum up support for the cause of taking out/arresting Kony. Over the past few day this video and the attached cause has become viral and has now infected every Twitter and FB feed on the internet.

What issue can one have with this campaign or the people behind it? A lot actually. Now before I write anything else I want to let all of you know that I as much as anyone else wants to do somethings to Kony and the LRA for the abuses they have wrought on the African people. With that said the people who are leading the crusade against him are as much part of the problem as the LRA is.

Let’s look at Obama and the US. He is going into Uganda to help crush this terrorist and evil man to help preserve the stability of the nation and that part of Africa. I question those motives based on past “humanitarian” interventions America has done and the context within which they have happened. There is alot of evidence (that would constitute a book within itself) that alot of what we call humanitarian interventions are nothing more than America flexing its muscles in places where the chaos can give it or its allies an upper hand. We seen it in Bosnia, Haiti, and many other nations. There’s also the issue of launching this campaign right after the west had overthrown the only government in the northern half of Africa that has had a consistent anti-imperialist foreign policy (Libya) that would have resisted US incursions into the continent.

Invisible Children although not as organized in their profiteering as America when dealing with human crisis has a nice rap sheet of its own. According to many sources

Now the reason why I mention all of this is not because I’m trying to debunk the organizations themselves but because they highlight the failed thinking that is still pervasive in westerns about world conflicts. There’s an undertone in the IC video and in the writings of those who are supporters of Kony2012 that if we don’t do something that this will never stop. It’s a very typical “white man’s burden” mindset on the world. Most of us look out into the world and see the issues of Uganda

The WMB mentality also covers up not only closeted forms of american exceptionalism and racism, or war, or poverty, or even AIDS. All of these (at least at the levels they are today) are a result of European colonialism. By making the story of some crazed religious fanatic that we should hate it distracts from the Ugandan dictatorship which is a major cause of much of the suffering of the people there and the US government who has supported the regime for over 20 years. It also hides the desperation due to neo-colonial destruction of Africa’s economy that has pushed people to join organizations like the LRA. All of this is hidden if we focus all the attention on making Kony “famous”.

What are we to do then? How do we advocate for the child soldiers, EU, or UN. None of these institutions have the right to dictate to these people or anybody for that fact how they should deal with their problems. We can give moral support but most military interventions that aim to bring peace end in new dictators and criminals or they end with mass civilian deaths due to the intervention (Iraq and Afghanistan are examples of both results). When we see these campaigns against some “evil” person in some other nation let’s be careful to put that person, their organizations, and the conflict into their proper contexts. Without doing so we are no better than the generations before us who allowed imperialism to gain a hold over the world in the name of first God, then civilization, then freedom

As an aside, freeing them up to fight a more dangerous – or a more pressing, perhaps – issue in Somalia. I don’t know if we would necessarily say that but it’s surely a plausible theory…” Just something else to think about…

1331116399.0,qll2d,[EFFORT] Social constructionism 101,coreyander,36,7,20,"SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM 101

""Socially constructed"" is a phrase that comes up in the Fempire a lot, just to point out that there are at least three propositions that people may be making when they use that term, each of which has its own implications. And, whether one intends one meaning rather than the other can fundamentally change the terms of a discussion.

So

PHENOMENOLOGY &amp; KNOWLEDGE

The idea that some things are ""social constructs"" originates in philosophy and early sociology, and early sociologist Max [Weber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_weber) (1864-1920).

In brief, as subjective experience is our only way of getting at objective reality. Since direct apprehension of objective reality is outside of our capabilities, he turned his attention instead to the more practical issue of how humans relate to an external world that they *assume* is real and natural.

Meanwhile, Weber found himself juggling the matter of objectivity and subjectivity as they relate to the *social* sciences. He concluded that objective knowledge of ""cultural reality"" is impossible, because cultural knowledge ""is always knowledge from particular points of view"".

KNOWLEDGE THROUGH INTERACTION

Alfred [Schutz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sch%C3%BCtz) (1899-1959) then took the works of Husserl and Weber and synthesized them into a general model of knowledge and social interaction that regarded knowledge as something [intersubjective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#In_philosophy) and generated through mutual agreement. That is, *all* knowledge is - at best - intersubjective, not objective.

Schutz's collaborator, asserting that our reliance on intersubjectivity to attach meanings to objective phenomena means that the ""[reality of everyday life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality)"" (in contrast to other 'realities' like those of dreams, fantasies, or alternate universes) is only possible through processes of socialization. According to this perspective, reality - as far as it is perceptible to us, that is, intersubjectively - is a social construct. That doesn't mean reality isn't ""real"" or that there is no objective reality, by its nature, to the extent that we give it a name

FIRST MEANING:

And this leads me (finally!) to the first meaning of social constructionism: it is the proposition that since all aspects of reality are perceptible only through subjectivity, though, not an [ontological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) one! Berger and Luckmann weren't making an argument about what does and doesn't exist, just how humans know what they know.

BUT...

As social constructionism picked up as a sort of uniting paradigm within sociology, [W.I. Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.I._Thomas) (1863-1947) and D.S. Thomas (1899-1977), made the observation that ""If men [sic] [define situations as real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_theorem), they are real in their consequences."" It is essentially a statement that something doesn't *have* to be objectively real in order to have real consequences -- people just have to act on it *as though* it is real. Biological race is a classic example: if a society defines race as something that exists and matters, race will no doubt have real consequences regardless of whether or not it actually corresponds to objective reality.

SECOND MEANING

Based on the Thomas theorem, not everything that is socially constructed in this sense is being asserted as 'not real' - the point is, whether or not it is real, people's belief that it is is sufficient to have measurable consequences.

So

1) that our *knowledge* of what race

2) that race

AND FINALLY

There is a third meaning that doesn't fit particularly well within the sociological usage I've painstakingly outlined

3) the proposition that something (race/gender/time) is itself objectively *unreal* but has consequences on social life that result from beliefs that people have about it.

WHY DOES IT MATTER IF PEOPLE INTERCHANGE THESE MEANINGS?

Depending on which meaning you intend, especially gender, because it involves an objective claim that something very deeply felt and experienced doesn't exist.

So

*My knowledge is almost solely from a sociological perspective

I can't justify reading Reddit if the ad revenue I provide facilitates the trading of child porn. That's not something I want to be a part of and there are other ways to access the benefits Reddit provides without facilitating child porn. That said

I think the best thing we can do is educate Reddit. We need to report abuses and follow up with the mods and admin to make sure they have actually addressed the issue. When they don't, but reported to the authorities with the full cooperation of the Reddit administration. A change in policy only matters insofar as it is enforced. This policy should be vigorously enforced. But it will only be enforced if we hold the Reddit administration accountable.

1373558949.0,1i35fd,Anti male circumcision activism and its links to other oppressions,anonymousali,47,13,193,"Hi SRS

It is a link talking about male circumcision and how men are often silenced if they question it or stand in opposition. It brings up a lot of discussion around infants and bodily autonomy that I supposed I have a stance on

My first issue with the article, ""what about the men?""). I agree that male circumcision doesn't receive as much attention as female circumcision but I kinda feel like that is for a reason. The physical impacts don't seem as terrible for male bodies as they do for female bodies and on top of that, female bodies are often circumcised in an act of control and oppression. I don't necessarily see how that can be argued for male circumcision. Regardless, I just really have a problem with the idea that we need to set up male circumcision in opposition to or in competition with women's rights.

Second, further complicating issues. Then I also think about Islam and female circumcision and I feel like it is much harder for me to acknowledge the cultural implications because again, I feel that the physical complications are much much worse and because of the links to control and domination over women. But at the same time, I don't want to be Islamophobic and have it in my head that Islamic practices are inherently oppressive. I am sure there are Muslim women out there who may feel empowered by their circumcision and who am I to tell them they're wrong?

However, suggesting that the democratic selection of 'upvoting' inevitably generates shitty (politically/morally questionable) content.  Such posters often believe that stronger 'modding' - wherein a central authority monitors/censors content - would make reddit a better place.  Perhaps they are right, and mods often do very good work in this regard.  But I also think that mods can easily overstep their bounds, restricting the free course of discussion and strangling the open exchange of ideas. 

I see a strong parallel here with political governance.  The people whose voices are loudest (in places like pics or wtf) are akin to demagogues - dominating the discussion through ignorant platitudes.  Many casual reddit users (perhaps white, cisgender men) promote such offensive, noxious views.  Similarly, in society at large, most people don't check their privileges.  Many seem to overtly, subtly, or institutionally continue structures of oppression (patriarchy/classism/heteronormativity).  Compare this condition to the central questions of marxism, or black nationalism, democratic change

I suppose then my question is regarding the nature of srs itself.  Does it aim to 'destroy reddit from the inside', less shitty)?  Is this latter goal even possible? and if so, how?

&gt;In addition, systemic gendered violence against women, and rape culture. Every single one of Anita's tropes assumes these to be true, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and therefore the damsel trope is seen as yet another man created idea to keep women down.

&gt;In reality, but as people. A male hero will literally go to hell and back and even die to rescue a damsel he sometimes doesn't even know. He does this not for a reward, but because it is ""right"". Justice and virtue are seen as sacrificing yourself and placing women above all. The villains, those worthy of death by the hands of the hero, are those commit the ultimate crime -- harming a woman.

Religion is most evidently a tool of the ruling class to dominate the lower classes. This was clear in the age of serfdom when serfs were forbidden from questioning their position in society.

1344703664.0,y1x39,[TW] Roommate described recent sexual encounter in detail to me. Not sure what to do.,throw-a-weigh456,43,12,14,"UPDATE

Thank you all for your input. My other roommate and I discussed our concerns with him last night. We said that we could not reconcile his actions and it will lead to a toxic living environment. He will be moving out in two weeks. I told him if he had any questions or anything to say he should do so now as this will not be a continued discussion. He had none.

Our landlord was made aware of the situation and he is supportive of our decision. My good roommate very clearly addressed in no uncertain terms what he did. He had no response.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My roommate had sex with a woman a few nights ago. From the detailed story he proudly gave me

Here is a list:

* I have been here 1 month
* I am not worried about my safety
* I have never seen his victim nor am I sure if contacting her is a good idea at all

I have NO clue what to do. My other roommate wants him gone

Please forgive the throw away account. I'm sure you understand.

She set out the idea of being Trans as breaking down gender barriers. People tend to consider being ""Men"" and ""Women""as big monolithic entities which people have to conform. Men spend their entire life trying to enact a perfect hegemonic masculinity but they never do. Trans people seek to challenge that and say that being a ""Woman"" can encompass lots of things

But then she compared this to Feminism. In lots of areas important to feminists being a ""Woman"" is treated as a large monolithic entity, vocational training all enforce the idea of ""Woman"" being an exclusive category. Then she gave the example of a women's refuge for domestic violence cases which only women are allowed into. This really is literally a temple of ""Womanness"" which only women are allowed into. And we think it's a really good thing. It's important to construct being a ""Woman"" into this big idea which people can be a part of in Feminism.

Then she went on to say how trans people are trying to cheapen and reappropriate the idea of being a woman and we shouldn't support them which made me fairly uncomfortable...

By now we've all seen the hateful diatribes against Mama June from 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.'  Of course they're all framed in how gross Redditors think she is.  They hate their family for being low SES (socioeconomic status), they're happy and love each other.  Not to mention they have a healthy sense of humor about what they do.

I must admit though

* sexualization of little girls.

* the pressure that comes from competition and children's tendency to internalize failure and the effects that has on healthy development of self-esteem.  I've seen footage of a few coaches and mothers who push little girls until they cry.

* little girls are taught that being pretty is the only way to win.

* dovetailed with this is the effect that happens when you are evaluated and judged based on your physical appearance.

* and

Maybe some of you were too young to remember the JonBenét Ramsey murder when it first happened

Many people were appalled at the images of JonBenét in full costume and make-up.  I remember some people's comments read like ""She looks like a prostitute!"" or similar other opinions.  Unfortunately other people voraciously defended child beauty pageants saying they build character and taught little girls how to grow up to be ""proper

Anyway

But I still can't help feeling extremely saddened and creeped out by child beauty pageants.  A Facebook friend posted this picture in a group about sexual abuse (particularly religious abuse) of children.  I thought it perfectly summarized how I feel about these pageants.

* On the basis of my gender
* In all church sermons
* I am comfortable with the existence of either a male or female washroom.

* I can relate to someone in the Bible on the basis of them having similar gender roles and/or being cisgender.
* I am comfortable with what the Bible says about my maleness or femaleness.
* If I am male
* If I am female

HETERONORMATIVITY/THE BIBLE

* The Bible supports my monogamous and heterosexual tendencies.
* There are monogamous and heterosexual role models in the Bible that I can relate to.

One of the things they have as a [cached thought](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/) is that ""politics is the mindkiller""

Nevermind the fact that the video in question was talking specifically about black Americans against white Americans, and the latter being a blanket term for immigrants who came at some point or another from Europe, and have light skin.

Nevermind the fact that unless you're talking about highly inbred groups such as Ashkenazis or Icelanders

###Racist thread two: [""An African Folktale""](http://lesswrong.com/lw/yl/an_african_folktale/)

Posted Eliezer_Yudkowsky himself (their leader)

Shortly afterwards, and that in oral cultures, stories are used to open discussion rather than close it off. After the aforementioned comments were posted, discussion cleaned itself up considerably, with [one person](http://lesswrong.com/lw/yl/an_african_folktale/r51) complaining about how easy it is to construct cultural strawmen based on folktales, and [another](http://lesswrong.com/lw/yl/an_african_folktale/r5l) quoting Eliezer's own take on the folk mythology of the USA.

This is a post included in the ""required reading"" section of SRSD. It's a good wake-up call to people who implicitly believe fat is inherently undesirable. I can understand how useful counterpoints to ""fat is unhealthy"" are in a culture that constantly antagonizes fat people using that logic. What makes me uncomfortable, ignoring the issues which makes these kinds of reversals problematic.

Prejudice against the ill was extremely common in history

This post makes multiple attempts to debunk casual associations between obesity and poor health. Whether or not these arguments in themselves are accurate is unimportant, if not actively condoning that stigma, at the very least missing the point?

Maybe my argument is one large derailment, is suggestive of healthy, able-bodied people throwing everyone else under the bus. She says near the bottom of this post

&gt; 8. Even fat people who are unhealthy still deserve dignity and respect. Still human beings. See how that works?

This is somewhat reminiscent to me of saying things like, and I could be tripping over a comparatively minor issue. However, I feel like there's got to be a way of fighting prejudice against fat that doesn't implicitly reproduce ableist modes of thought.

Today is international women's day. I made a reply post in the low efforpost above regarding how young people who first come to this site have their minds affected by poop posts. I am an uncle of a little girl. I have cousins who have daughters that are teenagers. I talk at lengths with them about the dangers of the online world

Addressing the problem we see on reddit that is prevalent elsewhere like facebook, tumblr, and photobucket. A task force that gives proper education on the dangers on the internet, as well as education for young men about how it isn't right what these people are doing and how to think for yourself. To promote the idea of empathy. A side issue that I feel passionately about is getting people to see that online people are just as real as people they see face to face. That if you wouldn't feel comfortable saying something to a person in front of them

From speaking with parents at length about this, but unless we do something to educate the youth, they will end up turning into what we fight today.

I can't say that this is my most passionate subject, all I saw were negative stories about how you were a downvote brigade. By investigating what you were about, I came to realize that I wasn't alone in the way I felt about the general redditry.

This is not isolated to Reddit. I've encountered this argument maybe three times in real life (all from white people), without requiring context or further explanation. Is it an aspect of white (and male, in some contexts) privilege that the way you choose to dress is automatically correct, as long as you're not dressing like a minority? Does this happen every time white America starts doing something that hip-hop came up with?

In this post I found myself using ""hip-hop"" and ""black people"" interchangably, including the people I'm arguing with. Is this backlash against hip-hop culture in particular, or black culture in general? (That is, classism or racism?) Neither? Both? Probably both.

I have to say, the concreteness and ""realness"" of this article can get depressing.

5. [Everyday Stranger Harassment and Women's Objectiﬁcation.](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/KimberlyFairchildStreetHarassarticle.pdf) This article presents an investigation into the negative effects of stranger harassment. They found that stranger harassment was positively related to self-objectiﬁcation for women who reacted to stranger harassment with passivity and self-blame

9. [My Body or My Mind: The Impact of State and Trait Objectiﬁcation on

1352516731.0,12y4k0,Is my teacher fatphobic?,obie_tuba,50,20,58,"Alright so let me start off and explain my situation a little bit. I am a first year tuba performance major at a major American conservatory. I'm lucky enough to have been awarded a full tuition scholarship to study and play in the orchestra here. It is great that I have avoided the student loan debt that so many people have to go into in order to get an education!

I am also a very large man. About six feet two inches three hundred pounds. I am asthmatic and have a few other health problems.  But this is no one's business but my own.

My private teacher is a very well respected member of the classical music community and more specifically the tuba community. He is 78 years old and played in a top 5 American orchestra for nearly 40 years

But he is also a really little guy. About half a foot shorter and one hundred fifty pounds lighter than myself. So he has absolutely no idea what it's like to be as big a person as I am.

He seems to have a problem with my weight though and it makes me uncomfortable to say the least. In one of my first lessons I was playing a slow lyrical piece of music and was having trouble completing phrases without breathing. It was something I was struggling with and I knew I needed to be more efficient with my air. My teacher said that I should try to expand my lung capacity. He suggested that I should do this by losing a bit of weight and that it would also be good for my health if I as I got older. This statement alone did not offend me. He's probably right and it seemed like a suggestion in good faith in order to help me with my tuba playing. I had no problem with that.

But it didn't stop there. The next week he asked me what my diet was like, and beer. I didn't appreciate this advice and found it a bit condescending. I know how to eat healthy and and my diet is none of his business! He is meant to teach me music, not to badger me about my weight.

Every week since he has mentioned my weight during our lesson. I really don't think it is a productive use of either of our time since I know very well how big I am. It also makes me feel judged and uncomfortable. I want to be able to go to him for guidance with my music making it is really upsetting that I feel as if he thinks less of me because of my size

The worst of it came this evening in our lesson when he told me that I will not win a job unless I lost weight. His reason was that the committee would see me and would ignore how good of a musician I was and choose a thinner candidate instead. I fear that he is correct

I hate feeling looked down upon because of my size and am very self conscious about it.

I want to convince her that she has the power to stop this. I talked about how this is textbook discrimination and harassment. She's worried about being blamed and thinks standing up for herself in her male dominated workplace will hurt her career prospects. She's scared of action and inaction. I don't know what to do and as a guy I feel like I'm becoming the patronizing figure by pushing her into action. Do I push her to do something she is uncomfortable with to get her to stop someone else doing something she is uncomfortable with? The irony is potent

Problematic comparisons between human oppression and animal mistreatment need not apply. **If you would like to discuss the ethics of veganism and animal rights, the right venue for that is /r/srsvegan which is now open to the public.**

Here is the primary rule for insulting people: Insult what they are doing, a gay person is disregarding the feelings of people with mental disorders, you want to target his insensitivity, not his gayness.  This makes it less likely that other people will leap to his defense, and that those who do leap to his defense are similarly bad people.

Scatological terms, shitlord, etc. are simple and rather effective.  However, they're also sometimes seen as the lowest common denominator in insults.

Various synonyms for ""evil person"" also still work.  The varlets, but that's probably all to the good.

In fact, for instance, if a garden-variety redditor replies to a picture of a girl holding a cat with ""Take that cat out from in front of your tits"", your proper response should be something like,

&gt; For the sake of the OneY conversation

&gt; The ""keeper of sex"" position is inherently unprivileged.  Sure, women give it"" or that ""Lock versus Key"" mentality, the position that women are in is a defensive one, while men are in the aggressive position.  

&gt; Defensive positions are inherently less privileged than aggressive ones.  As men, and when to start the conversation.  What do the defenders get to choose?  How to respond.  That's it.  (Again, within the confines of the hunter vs keeper of sex mentality) A woman has no input at all into the situation unless a man has already decided to start something.  Even better than that, depending on her responses, she runs the risk of being labeled a slut, prude, or a bitch.  She gets labeled based on her response to something *someone else started*.  This is not a privileged position.

&gt; (To veer off topic slightly - it's like being picked on by a bully twice your size.  Someone else has initiated the situation, and get called a weakling, or give in and get called a coward.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't, and all because of someone else's decision.)

&gt; tl;dr:  Within this mindset

&gt; Since this is OneY, men may be privileged, but that doesn't mean the gender role isn't harmful.  Not every guy is 'alpha' and goes after whatever or whoever he can stick his dick in.  Not every guy is comfortable in anonymous public settings.  Not every guy is comfortable making the first move.  In all of these cases, the guys that aren't, *shouldn't have to be*.  When the only way to be ""manly"" is to score with some arbitrary number of chicks, or to be the center of attention at the pub, or whathaveyou

&gt; The less we rely on gender roles to govern our behavior

As I re-read this, it's perfectly understandable that any given guy would feel 'powerless' in the decision whether or not to have sex.  Especially for less socially-adept guys, it's *extremely* difficult to keep in mind the fact that she wouldn't have a decision to make in the first place if it wasn't for his decision to talk to her.  In a sense, this entire mindset removes women's agency *entirely* because they are only defined by whether or not a man chooses to pursue them in the first place.

This also brings up privilege as an effect of agency - the side generally given bigger or more decisions to make is the one with privilege.  Clearly, as they're the ones initiating things in the first place, and women are only able to make decisions based off of the ones the men have already made.

Then to finish it off, romance, and casual hookup mentality, men have privilege - they get to decide who, what, when, where, men can choose any woman they want to sleep with.  Women only get to choose from the men who have pick them first.""",t5_2t5sa,True

Along the way, since I never go there. She immediately launched into a tirade of how much she hates the city because the majority of the inhabitants are black.

She started making cotton picking jokes, and at one point, yelled in the car, with the windows open, and I ducked down in the car, there's only white people where you live.""

&gt;sticking up for those who don't have the means to stand up for themselves

and his rationalization for being a proponent of chivalry is:

&gt;I'm a martyr at heart and I've seen too many close friends and family members get bullied and harassed. Sticking up for people

How do you respond to this? My instinct is that chivalry as a set of values is still oppressive because it is based on the idea that some people *need* saving by some gallant gentlesir in some greater position of privilege (chivalry, merely allows those already in a position of power to fancy themselves heroes), but, at the same time, I can't argue against the value of sticking up for the underdog since that's what I like to believe myself to be doing as an advocate for social justice. 

The word itself, but I suppose my disdain is not unlike the disdain many hold for the word ""feminism"": I don't think it's wrong to want to help people who need help, but I don't think referring to it as chivalry is useful. I worry that I, in this position, am like the ""equalist"" or ""egalitarian"" who doesn't like to label themselves a feminist because of the prefix ""fem-"". However, I am, of course, and that to deny that would go against social progress

I guess, even just in the sense of sticking up for those who are less fortunate, inherently problematic and, if so, how can this be easily explained to someone not well versed in social justice concepts?**

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Critical_reception) he supports Feminism, and is a part of the Men's Movement (not to be confused with the Men's Rights Movement, or at least, I've been told they're different). Apparently he used to work for NOW (National Organization for Women), but left because he felt their views had become anti-man and anti-father. He's also written several books, that deal with men's and women's issues. And he's been criticized by other members of the men's movement for using gender-neutral language and being a ""feminist apologist."" His books have titles like *Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say* and *The Liberated Man*. A recent book

So

* First of all, that last book, *Do Feminists Discriminate Against Men*, sounds like it could be rather ""what about the menz""-y. Also, I'm skeptical of a man writing a debate book with a feminist co-author who is also a man. Call me discriminatory, but I think if you want to argue about feminism with someone who has a feminist perspective, you ought to do it with a woman. Men can be Feminist allies for sure

* Anti-Feminists seem to really hate this guy

* He was invited by the White House to be an advisor to the White House Counsel on Women and Girls. So the White House apparently thinks he's pro-women enough. Again

* What's the deal with the accusation that Farrell is a rape apologist? What did he say? Is he a rape apologist?

**Bolding is all mine.**

&gt;In the past few weeks, asexuality and the asexual spectrum have gone from relative obscurity to being a frequent topic of conversation, at least on tumblr. The debate* that has arisen has raised the question of the validity of asexuality/grey-a/demisexuality as sexual orientations, as well as demisexual/grey-a people and aces are queer or merely appropriating queer identity. I have no comment on the former, because I do not feel the need to argue for the validity of my own identity for obvious reasons. With regard to the latter question, I do not offer an answer, however I do believe that it needs to be discussed. 

&gt;**The debate surrounding certain orientations along the ace spectrum and whether they can be considered queer is a worthwhile discussion, but it can and should happen without anger, hatred, accusations, or misinformation. A discussion on whether or not demisexual people, grey-a people, and aces should identify as queer can take place without hostility. The way to do this is to start communicating more clearly and to be sure that we all understand the terms we are using in the discussion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;**A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone.** It's more commonly seen in but by no means confined to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being ""halfway between"" sexual and asexual. Nevertheless, demisexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone of any gender; however, when a demisexual is emotionally connected to someone else (whether the feelings are romantic love or deep friendship), the demisexual experiences sexual attraction and desire, but only towards the specific partner or partners.

&gt;When describing demisexuality as an orientation to sexuals

&gt;""Demisexual"" is also sometimes used as a synonym for some other kind of person falling under the gray-A umbrella. Demisexuality differs from gray-asexuality in that demisexuality is a specific sexual orientation in between ""sexual"" and ""asexual""

-http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Demisexual

&gt;Demisexuality is the lack of sexual attraction unless an emotional connection is formed. It is on the asexual spectrum, it does accurately characterize the asexual nature of demisexuality which makes it easier to understand how it differs from “traditional sexuality”.

Because it assumes that everyone who does not call themselves Demisexual does not need emotional connection; that they'll just have sex with anyone regardless. Which is not true. It's very, and there's no reason to need to feel included in a special category for something that is the norm.

&gt;**There is a difference between people who do not identify as demisexual “needing an emotional connection before sex” and a demisexual person. When I do not have an emotional connection with someone,” but the point is, they experience sexuality differently from demisexual people. A lot of demisexual people identify as asexual until they develop and emotional connection with someone and start feeling sexual attraction, which is how the term arose...Another thing about demisexuals, which I would say you don’t know, since you don’t seem to understand how demisexuality differs from “the norm” , which I hope to post about soon, there may not be sexual feelings.** Why, I could probably pass for an allosexual person, wait

&gt;Under the Ace Umbrella: Demisexuality and Gray-asexuality
Posted on June 16

&gt;*I’ve heard about something called the “Ace Umbrella”.  What’s that about?*

&gt;There’s a gray area between asexuality and non-asexuality.  Some people say that they occasionally experience sexual attraction

&gt;Some people

&gt;One subtype of gray-asexuals

&gt;***So

&gt;**Many graces and demis tend to feel alienated by or disconnected from the sex-charged culture that they see around them.  Most of the time, the manner or frequency with which they do does not align with how “everyone else” describes their experience with sexual attraction.  In this way, their experiences are often very similar to the experiences of asexuals.**

&gt;**Many times, for all intents and purposes, they are equivalent to asexual during that period.**

&gt;***But isn’t that just “Normal” sexuality?  Most people aren’t attracted to everyone all the time.***

&gt;Certainly, but throughout the day, there might also be the hot co-worker or the random stranger on the sidewalk or the celebrity with the great body.  Even if most people don’t act on it, the attraction is still present.  Grays and demis aren’t like that.  **For a gray-asexual or a demisexual, there may be years between episodes of sexual attraction or there may have been only one person that’s ever caught their eye.**

&gt;*It sounds like demisexuals are trying to make themselves out to be special because they only have sex with people they love.*

&gt;Demisexuality is about attraction

&gt;Furthermore, not about sexual activity.

&gt;It’s also important to note that demisexuality is not, that does not mean that they feel there’s anything wrong with people who don’t require that bond to experience sexual attraction.

&gt;*Okay

&gt;Not necessarily.  The close emotional bond does not have to be love.  It could be friendship

&gt;*Are gray-a’s just asexuals who have sex?*

&gt;It’s not about what someone does, not a gray-asexual.  If an asexual masturbates, they’re an asexual who masturbates, not a gray-asexual.  The difference between “asexual” and “gray-asexual” is one of attraction, not behavior.

&gt;It’s not about enjoying sex, not a gray-asexual. It’s possible to enjoy sex and sexual activities and not experience sexual attraction.

&gt;*How can someone be “Gray”?  You’re either asexual or you’re not.  Clear as that.*

&gt;Is it clear where you fit if you’ve only felt sexual attraction once in your entire life, but don’t feel any drive to seek it out and would be fine without it?  Is it clear where you fit if you’re not sure what sexual attraction even is, let alone whether or not you’ve felt it?  Gray-asexuals live in this land of confusion.

&gt;*So what is gray-asexuality

&gt;**The definition of “gray-asexual” is intentionally vague.  It’s meant to be a catch-all for anyone who feels they fall somewhere near asexual on the spectrum between “sexual” and “asexual”.  There’s no strict criteria for what makes someone “gray”

&gt;*How can you know you’re demi or gray and not asexual?*

&gt;Well

&gt;Aside from that, then perhaps gray-asexual would be a better fit.  If you’re asexual most of the time, but there’s that one person you’re close to who’s an exception, then maybe demisexual would work.

&gt;*How can you know you’re asexual and not demi or gray?*

&gt;If you don’t feel like you’re demi or gray, but it can’t be ruled out completely.  It’s a bit like a scientific theory:  It can never be proven entirely, it can only be disproven.  After all, everyone who has experienced sexual attraction had a first time, and they probably weren’t expecting it to happen, either.

&gt;Look at it this way:  There are plenty of straight people in the world.  Most of them have never been attracted to a member of the same sex.  But how can they know for sure that they won’t be?  How can they be certain they don’t have dormant bisexual tendencies?  The common response is “Well, it’s impossible to know for sure.  It’s not something that stresses out a lot of straight people, yet I see a lot of aces worried that they might really be gray or demi.

&gt;For me, I’m not going to push it away.  If I happen to experience sexual attraction one day, then okay, I’ve learned that I’m not asexual after all.  I’m not going to let this word that describes me very well right now tell me what to do in the future.  You’re not permanently locked into asexuality for the rest of your life once you’ve used the word to describe yourself, so if it no longer fits, don’t try to make it fit.

It is only recently that I have become more aware of the privilege that I have. I am a queer (I identify as queer but for full disclosure I am attracted to both men and women) Latino (white-skinned) cis male. I am now 23 and for the longest time I was unconvinced that I had privilege as a cis male even though I was aware that others had privilege over me for being non-latino and straight. I am really ashamed now by how long it took me to realize my own privilege. For background I was one of those people that honestly thought ""feminism"" was dishonest for not being ""gender-inclusive"" (though never to the extent of an MRA). I did largely accept that the reason for any ""slights"" (minor though they are) against men was because of the established patriarchy. I did not believe feminism was ""against men"" or anything

Again

A few years ago my girlfriend (a rather knowledgable feminist) and I were talking about homophobia and she claimed that homophobia is a result of institutionalized misogyny in the patriarchy. Essentially

At the time I was very upset and I accused her of trying to appropriate the oppression of others under a woman-centric umbrella.

**WHY ISRAEL? - A VERY SHORT INTRODUCTION**


**1. What was the Holocaust?**

The Holocaust, was the industrial murder of about six million Jews in Germany and its occupied territories. 

**2. How is the Holocaust differ from other genocides?**

Germany was not a primitive state during the mass murders. It was highly industrialized and its people were well educated compared to other nations. Still
The mass-murder of the european jews was not an act against political enemies. Other regimes have murdered a lot of political opponents or ""foreigners"", not because they were political enemies. More on this later. 

**3. What is Antisemitism?**

Generally speaking, or suspicion of jewish People. Antisemitism is different from ""conventional"" forms of racism. ""Blacks"", ""Asians"", ""Indians"" and other minorities are generally looked down upon, they are given attributes such as ""lazy"", ""poor"", ""violent"", ""dirty"", more advanced race. 
A common Anti-Semitic view on the other hand paints a picture of a powerful executive who controls the media, who acts in the background, hidden from the public eye. It is an attempt to explain of how the world worksAn important aspect is the fact that, in an antisemitic worldview, jewish influence traverses borders, races and ideology. For example, anti-Semites argue that ""the Jews"" are responsible for both the negative aspects capitalism and the totalitarian communist regimes. (""jewish bolshevism"" and ""greedy jewish bankers""). In fact, ""the jews"" are responsible for all negative outcomes of capitalism. In fact, want to personalize structural phenomenons. Marx calls this ""reification"". In the antisemitic ideology
The eliminatory element of antisemitism (which was realized in Auschwitz) lies within this aspect: It is the will to eliminate the personification of an abstract power.

**4. Alright

The will to create a safe-space for jews is older than the Holocaust. But

**5. But the jews stole land from Palestine!**
First of all
 The United Nations then decided to create a jewish safespace in the area

**7. But Israel deported and expelled all the Arabs from Israel!**

While there were some violent attempts to drive arabs out of the Israel, the new state would be destroyed and they would be able to return.

**8. But today the Arabs don't have any rights in Israel! It's an apartheid state!**

In the Israeli parliament (The Knesset), anti-zionist party has 13 seats (out of 120). The Arab population is about 20%. 

**9. Yeah, there is racism in Israel, there is hatred towards arabs,…**

This is all true. It's not wrong to point out these aspects. The problem begins when people start using a double standard when it comes to criticizing Israeli politics. For example: While people are outraged by orthodox Jews demanding women to wear certain clothes

**10. What about the wall in Gaza?**

The wall was build as a reaction to suicide bombings in Israel and the large numbers of weapons that were smuggled into Israel. After its erection

**11. What does all this have to do with the Iran?**

The Iranian regime (That many

Since the link pretty much covers most of the terminology I want to go over stuff like obsession with loli and the consequences. While I never got into the whole loli thing other than holy shit that's cute I do understand there are various things from it ranging from romance related to sexual fetishes (IE hentai). This has gone to the point where many characters in anime look far younger than they should compared to their real age. However while I don't approve

An argument that is brought up often to counter is that it encourages dangerous thought patterns and just helps to cultivate certain feelings. I would like to have a source on that if possible. 

Another argument I heard is that such material can be good as an outlet for certain people and that it's better that they work it out on a 2D character rather than on a real life child. Or that what one feels for a 2D character is just completely different to how one views real life people. 

What do people think? Is loli truly victimless? Should they be treated the shame way as CP? Or is it not as dangerous/wrong but something not to be encouraged and discouraged if possible?

1325966415.0,o71dq,I live with a true blue manchild (IRL upvotes for sexism),theloniousnole,35,9,66,"My roommate is practically ripped off the front pages of Reddit

Suffice it to say

* He spends many hours a day playing video games, and maintaining his giant flat screen TV. Just imagine Seth Rogan's apartment from 40 Year Old Virgin, where he lives in a place that looks like pigshit, but there's a $900 TV and tons of video games. I try to keep the place nice but there's only so much I can do. I've actually heard him say to a friend of ours who just got engaged, ""Yeah it's nice to have a girlfriend cuz someone's there to clean up and cook.""

* He has a subscription to Playboy, right?"" (Or maybe you aren't thinking that). But here's the thing, he also wantonly watches hardcore pornography in the living room. In fact, one time he and another guy had hooked up a laptop to the TV and were watching hardcore porn in the living room... This made me feel *extremely* uncomfortable, and I made my discomfort pretty explicit and just nervously laughed it off saying, ""yeah...that's pretty cool :-\"" and since then he's done *that* sort of thing much less often, but one thing that hasn't stopped are his rampant backwards views on women

My roommate isn't a dumb guy, video games and eating, all he does is watch football. And not *sports* mind you, I literally mean *just football*. And like many guys who are huge consumers of football in America, he's bombarded with these crazy backwards and dangerous views on sex and gender roles. I'm sort of a ""typical guy"" too, and I love football, but any person critically watching the sport, etc has to disgust you at some point no matter what gender you are. But I digress..

Things my roommate does/says on a regular basis when we're watching football:

* Constant judging of the cheerleaders: 

""Ugh

""Wooh

* Disturbing sexist/hateful remarks about the sideline reporters (who in football are usually women)

""Thanks a lot Erin Andrews

""Did you know some famous singer is a shareholder for the Dallas Cowboys? No wonder they suck now

* General hateful/sexist comments

""Way to go _____

These are not exaggerations or anything by the way

And these aren't isolated incidents, and can only relate to women through sexualizing them. All in all this creates a bothersome situation for me because I don't know how to tell him that a lot of the shit he does and thinks is damaging to himself and society in general. The worst part is that for a guy like me, generally it isn't accepted socially to come out against hyper-masculine behavior or against bashing women like this, or being critical of pornography, because then it's assumed that you're gay, and that's definitely unacceptable (btw: I can't even count how many times he has made horrible homophobic remarks). Getting back to that, it's funny to me how acceptable it is now for every guy in the world to be watching hardcore porn that if you are a straight guy who basically says, I don't watch porn"" or ""I really don't like that stuff"" you'll be attacked. I've definitely been made fun of for it, I don't know how to break it. What would y'all do?

Background which brought up this question: 
So last week I was at a kink meetup on my campus. This group is made up of a mix of single people &amp; couples, I knew who she was through Fetlife (kink social website) but had never met her in person. Through Fet I knew she had started physically presenting as female in the past 6-9 months, and she is active at our queer center. 

The group started talking about Halloween plans and I mentioned that Rocky Horror Picture Show was going to be shadowcasted at the movie theatre over the weekend, and Friday night as ""Tacky Horror,"" aka drag night where you are encouraged to cross-dress. I called it the ""gender bender"" night (I couldn't remember their official name for it.) I mentioned I was thinking of going as Danny from Grease as my housemate (cis female) was going to be Sandy. 

This conversation went on for 5-7 minutes or so and then the subject naturally shifted. The woman I mentioned earlier left really soon after that, did I make her uncomfortable or trivialize her with this topic? I wanted to message her to ask but didn't really know how to say it without projecting. (Would I make it more awkward by assuming she was offended just because she is trans*? I didn't use any slurs but looking back realize that the entire conversation was possibly problematic even if I wasn't being bigoted.)

Today the campus queer center sent out an email and it had something wonderful in it. Everyone is probably familiar with the [""We are a Culture, and also still embarrassed as I haven't reached out to her yet to apologize (and I still don't know how to word my apology.) I also have some unresolved questions about cross-dressing on Halloween, which is where SRSD may want to chime in.

Second, or sexual identity and play it for laughs are fucked up and deserve to be called out. But is this always the case? What about women who cosplay as male characters at conventions? What if a man dresses as a specific female character (a male-presenting person was dressed as Minnie Mouse at a party this weekend)? Is Rocky Horror Picture Show transphobic (as Tim Curry is not really trans*) and harmful, or can it be done in a non-harmful way?

For this reason, they also validate survivors of trauma, by recognizing their existence, showing sensitivity to their needs, and allowing them the choice to then view the content or not. 

I think that we all generally agree that as a good faith service to each other, and thought it was appropriate that we discuss this as a community. 

1. When do you include a trigger warning?  I realize it is prudent to include a trigger warning whenever you include *an explicit description of a traumatic event* in a submission or comment

2. On Reddit, where should they go? How about when linking to a piece of media - should they go in the link itself, or before the link?

3. I have also noticed that many consider it helpful when composing a trigger warning to include *why* the content is triggering. Is that not triggeing

4. It is difficult to anticipate many triggers

 **Examples of topics that may require trigger warnings:**

&gt; - threats of death or violence.
&gt; - assault.
- stalking or harassment.
- rape culture
- sexual assault/abuse.
- domestic violence
- suicide.
- suicidal ideation.
- self-injury or self-mutilation.
- child sexual assault/abuse.
- incest.
- common phobias, or blood.
- genocide.
- fat-shaming
- abortion
- eating disorders, etc.
- OCD

This list is pretty broad. Which of these qualify? Can we agree on some common triggers?

5. I have noticed that some SRS users are utilizing a **system of abbreviations** that look like this:

&gt; - TW - General trigger warning. 

&gt; - CSA - Child (children

&gt; - SA - Sexual Assault or Abuse which includes

&gt; - SU - Suicide

&gt; - SUI - Suicidal Ideation (that ""I want to die!"" stage before being actively suicidal. This is when people start making their plans

1325875686.0,o5ptn,The 99% Isn't Me: Being the Minority in the 99% (Repost from my personal blog,Willrich354,33,5,28,"Source: http://redsociology101.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/the-99-isnt-me-being-the-minority-in-the-99/

This movement was birth as an American manifestation of the spirit that gave rise to the Arab Spring that overthrew the Egyptian and Tunisian dictatorships that sought to bring the pro-democracy spirit to America in its own way. The main slogans of the Occupy Movement are things like “Occupy Everything” and “We are the 99%”. These slogans manifested themselves quite literally in the hundreds of occupations of public parks, the rest of the western hemisphere, and even in parts of Europe and Asia that are going on as we speak.  They organize without leaders, using consensus democratic processes in most places, and seek to create the basis for equalizing the wealth of this nation between ALL its citizens.

Now the obvious question that’s probably being levied at me right now in your head is “why would you be against this?” I will say this: I support the goals and ideas of the Occupy movement but I think the movement is on weak foundation and further I believe as an African I have little in common with the occupiers and their movement in terms of tactics, issues with the idea of occupying stuff, and issues with having our voices heard. I’m going to try to be specific to my criticisms from an African perspective and while I do have more generalized criticisms of the movement I will try and leave them other to expand upon or I may do it myself in another article.

“We are the 99%!” “Who me? Nah I’m just black”

As a sociologist who specializes in social inequality and the dynamics of the movements that seek to redress said inequalities, studying inequality it’s not the 1% vs the 99% it’s really the top 10-20% vs everyone else. Including that top 10% in with the movement lacks accuracy of description (which one can say isn’t the most important thing in the world) and of whom the enemy is. That top 10% that largely manages the system for the superrich aka the 1% are almost more responsible for the current situation than they are. These are the stock brokers, banker assistants, and politicians / lobbyists, who chose, in full knowledge of what damage they were doing cooked books, cheated homeowners, until you take off that uniform you are just as responsible for clubbing a student with the stick as the mayor who ordered you to do it.

Another issue I have with the 99% concept is that it smacks of the rhetoric we black and brown people heard from the Left back in the 70’s, kind of if you ignore much of American history. My oppression as a black man in America is very, very different from that of a poor white person. Yes we both ended up poor and without food or a job but he doesn’t get called a nigger or have to deal with the very real reality of racism. Although the white middle class who’s central to the Occupy movement are right about Wall Street and politicians they fail to see that the struggle is different if you’re a woman, gay, Black, Latino, Native American

Related to this idea we have to question the veracity of the 99% when many in the 99% are oppressors themselves. The kindly white people from the suburbs of Buffalo that has joined our occupation don’t realize that they had a lot to do with (due to apathy and ignorance) why black and latino people in Buffalo are so bad off today. Men don’t realize we oppress women and promote rape culture every day, the moral of the story is that everyone is not in the same boat and by virtue of that uniqueness we wish the dominant classes of society would begin to deal with us on our own terms not theirs.

“Go Occupy Your Own %$#@”

This issue stems very much from the last paragraph and that has to do with message and who it caters to. The occupy movement was started by the professional left and the white middle class (men in particular). That is a fact (which people are very uncomfortable with) that has shaped the rest of the events that have transpired in the movement. One of the consequences of having the middle class at the front aside from the 99% slogan is the idea of occupying stuff. The thesis behind it is that we as the 99% built this nation and do most of the work yet the 1% hordes the wealth and power for themselves. Therefore what we should do is occupy real and political space and take back what rightfully belongs to us.

The problem is that none of this stuff is ours. And by none of it I mean NONE of it. This nation is an example of what some call settler colonialism. Basically it’s: See nice land with people—kill all the people/ enslave them—move in on land—claim that this is now your homeland. That’s America’s history in a line a nation of genociders, and the survivors of the slaughter. If the movement really wants to be inclusive they need to acknowledge this history. The slogan “Decolonize the Occupation” has been going around for a while among the native community in response to the occupation and basically the message is that yes we understand your goals and stand behind them but this is our land, stolen from us, just for you ought to be dependent on justice for our people too. How can you occupy something that is stolen?

The other major issue that comes up here is that the middle class (and Americans in general) is lamenting the loss of their livelihoods and lifestyles but they fail to remember that all they got is stolen from other people. There is no taking back blood money or recouping losses due to illegal activity. For black people many of us ask why you would even want this back. From the land

“Stop It! That’s Divisive!”

The above line is the almost automatic response to almost anyone who has brought up race or gender or class (between middle and working class people) issues in the occupation. To many people the Occupy movement is strictly about economic inequalities and Wall Street not about race, women, or the unemployed as supporters.  It’s indicative of a lack of recognition of race, gender, or class (and other issues) in the occupation (and its connection to capitalism and economics) and any felt need for the creation of spaces to deal with these issues in any real way.

A very good instance of this was when an older black woman at Occupy Buffalo during one of the first GA’s brought up a proposal to boycott the Buffalo news establishment (the Buffalo News, and 7 and other outlets) because of the years of racism, classism, and suburban bias that all these institutions have exhibited. Now for anyone who’s black in Buffalo the Buffalo News is worth little to nothing because of how bad it is at reporting on issues in the city and portraying our community in particular in a very negative light while ignoring much of the corruption and nefarious activity that goes on in City Hall or in the suburbs. After making the proposal there was a few blocks that came up and when the facilitator asked one of the women why she blocked the proposal she said “I understand why this is an issue for you but since the news is reporting on the occupation nicely and not slandering us it would hurt the movement to go along with this” aka I don’t really give a hoot since the movement is more important than that issue.

Another local instance was when O Buffalo hosted a Police Appreciation Day to celebrate peaceful police and give the BPD a pat on the back for not arresting them or harassing the occupation.  Problem: why they were patting them on the back the BPD was elsewhere in the city like they have always been doing harassing black and brown and poor people. Then when I and others brought up the issue we were derided as bring divisive and too radical.

The point of telling these two stories is to say that the occupation is unfriendly to those who don’t wholly invest in the ideas of the 99% and all that comes with it. Consensus democracy makes sure that the minority, which are unique to us, known without being called whatever why would we want to come down to the occupations? Many locals wonder why they are so white, or male, or whatever much of the problem is that your movement is organized to cater to white middle class men who can afford to camp outside 24/7 and have the political and material resources to stay there. It’s not catered in any way to say a single Latina women with children and it’s unlikely that she would ever show up to a general assembly because of that.

Conclusion: “Let’s Do Our Own Thing”

When I started following the occupation I was amazed at the organization, American people’s front the occupation is a reflection of all that is good and bad about American society. That includes racism, sexism, homophobia, aversion to radical politics and the like. Because of the presence of these elements at large and the lack of organized redress of these issues many have decided to abandon the occupations and strike out on their own. I have decided to do the same and call on other people of African descent to do the same. I say this not out of bitterness but out of recognition of the history of black people and other minorities in movements and institutions dominated by middle class whites. They support freedom and change as long as they lose nothing and we don’t force them to question their own morality or privilege. This has been an endemic issue on the Left that needs to be addressed if there is ever going to be a truly united revolutionary movement in America.

Looking at how Africans in the past dealt with white Leftists and revolutionaries they always took the stance that we as oppressed people need our own space to articulate our struggle and push our struggle forward. The place of whites in that case is to make change within their communities and make sure we don’t get slaughtered fighting for our freedom.  The first and most important problem with the occupy movement that leads to all that I have written about is that they sought to speak for everyone in America without really knowing what we want and how we want to go about getting what we want. Until white/ male liberals and leftists take the time to understand the oppressed on their own terms vs. always trying to bring them behind their movements or ideas the Left will never be able to mount any real offensive against capital that won’t collapse under its own contradictions.",,t5_2t5sa,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/o5ptn/the_99_isnt_me_being_the_minority_in_the_99/

Okay, have a dog together.  He is Super Awesome overall, but there are some things about him that really bug me.  ""Really bug me"" is understatement of the year.  


We have discussed feminism earlier on in the relationship- he actually mentioned on our first date that he was a feminist, racism or etc... I mean, getting into MRA territory no?  He doesn't see the advantage he has-- he is a white male who is also very intelligent, he makes a 6-figure salary...I mean, c'mon.  I know he wasn't raised into the upper class, but he thinks that any acknowledgment of privilege is the same as saying he hasn't worked hard his entire life.  


He also states he has overcome being bullied as a child and was seen as stupid growing up, and I completely get that he Has had to overcome adversity- something he often brings up automatically should I bring up something regarding prejudice, however that does not take away from the adversity from minority groups-.  Being a woman is often like having a speech impediment your entire life, but without having to say anything in order to be judged and evaluated.  People just look at women and think of them as ""other"" or somehow less important--I know things are getting better and this is not the case for everyone, but ""Society"" does this all the time.  


Okay, instead of apologizing should I find it offensive, he basically will justify what he says by telling me it's not offensive.  He is telling Me what is not offensive...wha?  Yesterday specifically- we were watching Mythbusters and there were a male and female professional baseball/softball players- and on the show they referred to the male by his name or his profession or by the fact that he was a man, and they referred to the female as a ""girl.""  I said ""I dunno, she looks like a woman to me.  My boyfriend then proceeds to tell me that most women don't mind being referred to as ""girl,"" and that some even prefer it because it makes them seem young and pretty.  I didn't even recognize my boyfriend at this point, and I stood my ground I asked him how he could even know that.  He always dismisses studies due to bias, it offends me.  He says okay


Several weeks ago, but partners/girlfriends- who would be women.  Anytime he says anything offensive and I call him out on it (as politely as I can) and he doesn't find it offensive, he does not apologize but instead goes on about how it's not offensive because he didn't mean it offensively.  I have tried to explain that because he does not Know he is being offensive does not mean he is not being offensive.

I suspect, wherein resentment about Western colonialization and supplantation of ideas leads to frustration with white people in general, or similar to ""small town mentality"" in rural areas or even tribal-like social systems in urban regions that prioritize people of a certain social status even within the context of racial oppression.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a truth universally *un*acknowledged that we are living in the midst of a stalled gender revolution. The women's movement has been very successful in helping women break into the formerly male-dominated market of paid labor. But there has been no corresponding movement of men into the female-dominated non-market of unpaid labor mostly performed within the home. Like a rubber-band stretched to its limit

""The Second Shift"" recounts Arlie Hochschild's studies on how housework and childcare is shared by couples all across America

According to her

**The Problem Is...**

...that for a variety of reasons, family, marriage, and work. There are literally not enough hours in the day to do everything, even though many women sure do try. Hochschild's research found that women work a full extra month compared to men every year, on average, in such homes. Equally important is the leisure gap between men and women: in the hundreds of couples she interviewed she found that most men take time for themselves and their hobbies, as a result, stress, since the entire weight of traditional gender roles allows them to balance work

WHY and HOW this happens within the microcosm of the home is what the book is about. Hochschild analyzes this under the lens of four core concepts - 

**1. Gender Ideology**

Gender ideology is what a person believes about what is ""proper"" for a given gender to do, that women belong at home and with kids, that men are providers);""egalitarian"" (the belief that both men's and women's career ambitions are equally important, and deserve equal support by men sharing in unpaid domestic and childcare work equally); and ""transitional"" (a blend of the above two, typically manifested in women as the desire to have a great career while also being responsible for home and family, and in men as being ""all for"" their wives working, and willing to ""help out"" a little but she remains in charge of home and family).  

Take the example of Nancy and Evan Holt, a man who shares in domestic work and supports her career as a social worker equally to his. Nancy is egalitarian. Evan on the other hand ""thinks it's *fine* for Nancy to have a career, and he can see it's very important to her, but can't understand why *her* choice should change or affect *his* life."" His gender ideology is classic transitional. 

Another example: Frank and Carmen Delacorte, though, is that when it comes to household chores (though not childcare) they are almost egalitarian. Frank, even while maintaining that Carmen does everything, actually pitches in and does *way* more domestic work than Evan Holt. Frank and Carmen are traditional ""on top"" but nearly egalitarian ""on the bottom"". 

It's not at all uncommon for 'top' and 'bottom' gender ideologies of a person to be in direct conflict. For example, revealed that they were in fact traditional when it came right down to it. Many women who *claimed* to be egalitarian often suffered from guilt when they confronted their husbands about not doing enough around the house, and did a lot more around the house just as a gift to their husbands because they somehow didn't feel good about ""making"" him cook and clean, revealing that they were 'transitional' underneath.

A poster arguing in defense of the OP claimed that men are robbed/attacked every day, feel nervous in certain situations with strange men might help him see that it isn’t just blind sexism.

I became increasingly upset with each response so I’m not sure if I was entirely clear in my explanations.

But I’ve learned to be alert and at least a little on guard, but that’s quite rare in my personal experience.

This really shook me. It’s really important to me to treat people equally, cause harm, or perpetuate harmful ideas. The idea that I might be a bigot in any way drives me to tears, but even my grandmother seems to think that my argument is sexist (which she demonstrated by saying “What if you replaced the word ‘man’ with ‘black person’?”).

Dick, is something of a congratulatory term: just look at the way ""team America"" defined it--a necessary evil to keep ""pussys"" and ""assholes"" in line.

This seems to be a last-resort tactic of privileged people involved in conversations about -isms. Invoking a fallacy is a very effective way to discredit your opponent and 'win' the argument.

* First example: A man and woman are discussing street harassment. The woman recounts experiences she has had. The man tells her that her perception of those experiences were mistaken. She tells him that

* Second example: A MRA and feminist are discussing the men's rights movement. She characterizes it as an antifeminist movement. He denies this and accuses her of using a straw man argument.

The above are situations I've actually seen occur on this site. In many cases, while the person accused of committing the fallacy is criticized and downvoted. It seems that, oftentimes, bystanders don't actually understand whether a fallacy has really been committed. Simply making the accusation is enough to bring on the downvotes and pitchforks.

Accusing someone of committing a fallacy seems like a more sophisticated version of pointing out grammatical or spelling errors in order to suggest your opponent is ignorant or st*pid. As with other derailing tactics like the tone argument

Let me be clear: I'm not saying every instance in which someone points out a fallacy is wrong or derailing. But I've noticed that it's increasingly being used as a derailing tactic to silence minorities and their allies.

&gt;This is why I hate these kinds of discussions. They all eventually devolve into a discussion of the typical Christian antisemitic dichotomy of: ""Old Testament"" = legalistic

and some others like it.  I received a variety of responses and questions

I was really unsure how to write this honestly.  What I would want to do is give a long explanation of the history of the Christianity's use and abuse of the Old Testament vis a vis the Jews

I can try to tell you a little bit about how I feel though, I should say that I am a queer religious Jew.

Living in a Christian society, and I grew up in a somewhat insular religious Jewish community, went to an Orthodox synagogue every week, attended Jewish religious private school for 13 years...

I'm not saying that Judaism is never oppressive.  I'm not saying that it's less oppressive than Christianity.  I'm not saying that the Old Testament is better than the New Testament.

What I am saying is that the reason we (myself included, less hateful, less intolerant than the Old Testament/God  is not because it's true, and not even because that's the only way Christianity makes sense, but because that's what centuries of official Christian, anti-Semitic dogma has trained us to think.

Saying the Old Testament is legalistic and intolerant while the New Testament is ethical and loving is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea

I don't think saying that religion is evil (necessarily) carries any antisemitic overtones.  I don't think criticizing the Bible (necessarily) carries any antisemitic overtones. I do think that criticizing the Old Testament while approving of the New Testament almost always has antisemitic overtones (even though unintentional).

I have a very very different visceral reaction to this

&gt;let me say that I'm a lapsed Jew

than to this

&gt;Now if you're a red-letter Christian you get a free pass, in the New Testament, parts of the Old Testament like everyone's favorite piece of shitbaggery like Leviticus have been rescinded, so they don't count as part of the Bible. But, in literally every Bible used by Christians, Leviticus is still in there. You're still using the Leviticus Bible. Cut out the crap and just decry the Old Testament entirely. I doubt there's any maliciousness in still including the oppressive Old Testament, but the issue is so danced around you'd think it was a performance art piece.

(Sorry

Do you want me to prove to you though that it's not just me?  And that what I'm saying about the centuries of Christian antisemitic abuse of the Old Testament is actually true?  I can try...

The Christian Churches have used the Old Testament against the Jewish people in several ways: denigrating the Old Testament

&gt;When you sacrifice a fellowship offering to the Lord...It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned up...Whoever eats it will be held responsible because they have desecrated what is holy to the Lord; they must be cut off from their people (Leviticus 19:5-8)

is Jewish

&gt;Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people

is not.

Here are a few of the things I came across in my failed attempt to become an instant expert on this topic:

&gt;Although Christians have traditionally credited Paul with the notion that the covenant with Christ has supplanted the covenant with Moses – thus setting up the Old Testament/New Testament paradigm – a wave of scholarship has been building in Pauline studies (often referred to as the “the new perspective on Paul)” that argues that Paul never had any such supersessionist ideas.  

&gt;There is no doubt that many negative statements about the Torah can be found in Paul’s letters.  But many scholars have convincingly argued that these statements are not intended as a wholesale rejection of Jewish law.  There are far too many positive statements Paul makes about Jewish law for such a view to be tenable. The more convincing explanation of Paul’s negative statements about Jewish law is that he opposes Jews or Judaizing Christians who wish to impose Jewish law on Gentiles as a prerequisite for being in Christ; he is not rejecting the Mosaic covenant per se.

&gt;Rather, gentiles  - at least gentile believers in Jesus – can now be included in the heritage of the Jews as made known in the scriptures, but they do not need to become Jews..to partake of that heritage

&gt;The unquestioning authority of Jewish scripture that prevailed in the first century began to change in the second century.  The Epistle of Barnabus..argue[s] that the scriptures of Israel have been completely misunderstood by the Jews

&gt;Some Christians of the second century began..to question how these scriptures…bore relevance for Christians..Furthermore, Christians began to see the negative statements about the Torah made by Paul as applicable to Jews and Judaism.

&gt;The first..argument for a full-scale rejection of the scriptures of Israel came from a radical Paulinist named Marcion

&gt;[Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament..held maltheistic views of the God of the Hebrew Bible..that he was inconsistent

&gt;Justin [Martyr] makes an argument for the validity of Israelite scripture for Christians..The law was a kind of ad hoc necessity because of the disobedience of the Jews.  “Thus,’ was ordained simply in order, that, even in the dispersion, the Jews might remain identifiable, and not escape their merited punishments”..

&gt;Eusebius constructed the distinction between “Hebrews” and “Jews”..the Mosaic legislation and the establishment of the Jewish nation was caused by the people’s “moral weakness” at the time, Moses, and the prophets become the ancestors of the Christians; the biblical heroes are seen as pre-Christ Christians.  The Jews, on the other hand, are seen as illegitimate offspring, a people rightfully deprived of their heritage because of their depravity..

&gt; For Christians to gain stature in the eyes of Rome they had to demonstrate they had deep roots in antiquity.  Rome’s tolerance for Judaism and peculiar Jewish practice was largely predicated on Judaism’s claims to a long-standing tradition extending far back in time.  The need to prove to Rome that Christianity represented a long tradition exacerbated the need to push Jews out of the historical picture and claim the scriptures of Israel as exclusively Christian.

&gt;”Modern” Christian biblical studies in the Western world began during the Reformation and Enlightenment periods.  Historical criticism emerged as the dominant form of Christian biblical criticism among Protestant biblical critics as a result of the emphasis Luther, rather than according to Church teachings on the Bible…

&gt;To correct for the “subjectivity” of interpretations..historical criticism sought the original, and Christian historical critics read the biblical texts accordingly…the Christian perspective from which this work was done typically produced interpretations of the Bible and of history..that demonstrated Christianity’s superiority over Judaism.  The Christian desire to reveal the truth of the Bible was ultimately the desire to demonstrate that Jesus and his message were the fulfillment of God’s plans for humanity.

&gt;The same rationalist doctrines which triumphed in 1789 provided the ideological basis for the modern secular Jew-hatred of the 19th century.. Proudhon...thought “Monotheism is so little a Jewish or Semitic idea that the race of Shem can be said to have been repudiated by it…Monotheism is a creation of the Indo-Germanic spirit and could not have arisen from any other source""…Proudhon..accuses the Jews of having placed themselves “beyond the conscience of the human race” by the stubborn rejection of Jesus – even though personally Proudhon did not believe in the Christian message – regarding the founder of Christianity in secular terms as a revolutionary populist-socialist.  In Proudhon’s account it is doubtful if Jesus even belongs to “the race of David”; and there is nothing in common between Christ’s revolt against sacerdotal tyranny

&gt; Modern racial antisemitism in Germany…its roots may be found in the radial critique of Judaism that originated with the Young Hegelians..They provided a systematic, vengeful, stubborn, egotistical, imperious and absolutist.

&gt;As scholars in the nineteenth century came to identify religions that they designated as ‘Buddhism” and “Hinduism, evidenced by the numerous parallels in the myths of Jesus’s and Buddha's childhoods. His work was frequently cited in efforts to “prove” the Indo-Germanic nature of Jesus. 

&gt;Connections between Jesus and Indian Buddhism were promoted by Germ man and French romantics, suggested parallels between Jesus and Buddha because both preached asceticism; the faith of Jesus was that of Indian religion and stood in sharp opposition to Judaism. the religion of optimism, not pessimism. 

&gt;Redefining Jesus was not a trend that stood in isolation from the practice of religion, citing the authority of the most distinguished historian of early Christianity of the time, Adolf von Harnack, who himself had written that the elimination of the Old Testament from the Christian canon would complete Luther’s Reformation.

from [The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany (2008) by Susannah Heschel ]( http://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&amp;vq=anderson&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s)

&gt;Strikingly, the famous Christian historian and theologian Adolf von Harnack argued that the OT should be published separately from “Christian scripture” because it is contradictory to the New Testament—a suggestion resembling the thought of Marcion, about whom Harnack had written the definitive study.  

&gt;Of course, they completely disassociated the OT from contemporary Jews, Judaism, and Jewish culture. 

&gt;Cardinal Faulhaber
These books were not composed by Jews; they are inspired by the Holy 
Ghost, that between the OT scripture and other Jewish writings like the Talmud, which are not divinely inspired, and that between what is of permanent value in the OT and what is of transitory value.. Like his predecessors in antiquity, Cardinal Faulhaber's defense of the OT is made at the expense of the Jews, not because he felt any “common heritage” with the Jewish people. 

&gt;One particularly interesting Christian thinker who allied himself with the Nazis but also argued against the Deutsche Christen rejection of the OT was Gerhard Kittel.  Kittel was a New Testament scholar and one of the foremost authorities on ancient Judaism...He, only he did not make the cut-off the death of Christ, but the Babylonian exile. Prior to the exile, Israel was a state with its own laws and boundaries and land. But after the exile, some Jews chose not to return home. Thus, the diaspora led to a wholly new form of Judaism; “Jewry became a religion and a race without a homeland.  Furthermore, because they had no actual political power

Lastly

Judith Plaskow discusses this sort of thing in ""Feminist Anti-Judaism and the Christian God"" (Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, 1991), pp. 99-108)

&gt;In the case of the relationship between Jewish and Christian feminists, even to perceive, the differences between us. On the one hand, there is the long history of Christian anti-Judaism, firmly rooted in the New Testament, and expressing itself historically in social, economic, and religious sanctions against Judaism and Jews..

&gt;On the other hand, they are simply not interested in him. The fundamental irrelevance on a religious level of Christianity to Judaism means that Christians taking Judaism seriously as an independent, living tradition must rethink the self in a way that is not true for Jews in relation to Christianity.  What does it mean to affirm Christian identity without defining it over against Judaism? This is a question that the Christian tradition has never found a way to answer. And in large measure, it still has not been resolved by Christian feminists, who have simply turned feminism into a new way of yet again defining Christian identity at the expense of Judaism

1339110948.0,uqm7m,What is your take on the CDC rape statistics?,nbarnacle,32,8,28,"So

Just to summarize: 1 out of 5 women (20.3%) report that they've been raped, because CDC did not count this as rape, but as ""other sexual violence"" (which is very problematic, clearly, but that's not the point right now). 5.2% of women and 0.4% of men have reported ""attempted forced penetration"". For other sexual violence (sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact, and non-contact unwanted sexual experiences), and 18% of men.

So as we can see

In the last 12 months, this is the data for ""made to penetrate"", which CDC does not count as rape). For other sexual violence within the last 12 months, 5.6% of women report it, and 4.2% of men.

So my question is: why do you think that the rape rates for men and women for the last 12 months are approximately the same

I was thinking it might have something to do with the study sample itself, etc. that happen over their life. The sample that CDC used varied across ages (and other variables). I can't seem to find the median age of participants in the study, but the ages varied from 18 to over 65 (page 102). So my theory (based on purely conjecture) is that women are more likely than men to get raped in certain situations and environments, and these will also be specific to certain *populations* of women. For example, it's well known that [college women are at a higher risk of getting raped](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf) than the general population of women. Also, could it be that women are more likely to get raped under the age of 18 than men are, and that would explain why more women are *reporting* a rape within their lifetime, is it possible that men and women are just as likely to get raped when they are in long-term relationships

Also,28,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/sf37i/when_where_and_how_is_it_appropriate_to_comment/,"This post got somewhat long.  I believe that everything in this post is generally agreeable.  I do however divided it into two parts.  First, starting points which I believe nobody will dispute (perhaps 2).  Second

**Starting points**:

1. Shitlords think with their penis and post shittons of comments about what their penis thinks even though nobody asked and nobody cared (especially the person whom their penis is thinking about).

2. Everything that can be described can be discussed (assuming all parties to the discussion are comfortable discussing the topic and posses the maturity/intellectualism to discuss it in a meaningful way).

3. We recognize that humans have social systems for determining when comments are appropriate.  In the real world (off the internet)

4. People are special snowflakes.  What one person may find rude, not for interacting with yourself.

**Commentary**

The easiest standard is the highest possible standard.  You should not comment on somebody's physical attractiveness without their explicit permission.

The shitlord standard is the lowest possible standard.  You can comment on anybody at any possible time.  (obviously I am not advocating this).

However

I wanted to briefly list what I saw as possible relevant factors and challange any SRSer to come up with a ""hard and fast"" rule or set of rules for when comments were appropriate:

* sollicited or unsollicited comment
* positive or negative comment (compliment vs insult)
* who can hear the comment
* duration/closeness of personal connection
* presentation of the pereson being commented upon

I wanted to briefly talk about the ""presentation"" bullet (read: I wanted to forstall a shitstorm).  The presentation idea is among the most difficult to discuss.  Shitlords seize on presentation (""she was asking for it,"" etc.) and those examples must all be condemned.  **But,** we can very easily find situations where people present themselves in a way which indicates that they desire comments about their physical attractiveness ([/r/gonewild](/r/gonewild) OR your significant other sending a 'naughty' picture with the text ""you like?"").

Speaking to negative comments: it is instinctual to say that no negative comments are allowed.  I think that idea fails to work well in reality.  It is obvious that deliberately hurtful comments are inappropriate but a good well-meaning friend saying ""that brand of makeup turns your skin a weird shade of orange"" is very hard to condemn (sollicited or unsollicited).

The question is being asked for both ""the real world"" and reddit.

**tl;dr:** It's really hard to write simple rules for commenting on physical attractiveness.  Does SRS have any ideas?

**Addendum/Note:** I would prefer answers that are dependent only on the person commenting but not the person being commented on.  The relationship between them does qualify as fair game.  While somebody may be uninformed of whether their actions constitute rudeness

The background of this conflict and its implications lies in two separate conflicts that have converged in the EZLN and these are neoliberalism and indigenous conflict. Neoliberalism is an ideology that has developed in the post 1968 revolutionary period around the idea that the market can do it better. This idea, World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.  The most important of these measures in relation to this discussion is the North American Free Trade Agreement which went into effect on December 31st, 1993. The next day the Zapatista uprising began with the rebels taking over major towns and cities in southern Mexico and attacking successfully a Mexican army outpost. Their problem was that NAFTA would break down economic borders between Mexico, Canada, and the United States. This in their eyes would destroy the Mexican worker and peasant and solidify the Mexican government’s position as simply a corporate enforcer of capital. The major driver of that process for them would be American corporations competing directly with the poor farmers and factory workers of the region in grain production, farming of cattle

The other major conflict that came to a head at the same time was the ongoing fight between white Mexicans and the indigenous groups who are descendent from the Mayans and other pre-Columbus civilizations. Much like the conflict seen in other colonized nations in Mexico Mayans and other indigenous groups held little to no power in government and suffered abuse at the hands of armed forces. The history of the Chiapas (the Mexican state within which the EZLN is now in power) in the context of modern Mexican history has been one of oppression from those who are in power on one hand and intermittent revolutions or uprisings on the other. Many of these rebellions and protest movements took on a Marxist or anarchist flavor in terms of articulation of goals and political rhetoric. This background conflict once again came to a head as NAFTA was beginning to pass because many in Chiapas believed that it would be yet another reason for the Mexican government to abuse them for profit. This ethnic conflict coupled with the radically capitalist nature of NAFTA and other neoliberal economic measures created the conditions from which the EZLN rose. It can be thought given the history of the people involved and the politics of Mexico whether a group like the EZLN emerging was just a matter of time. The name of the group itself is derived from that of Eliliano Zapata

There is one other thing to take note of before we go into the discussion about the ideas of revolution and liberation. We have to think about how the meaning of these terms comes about in the first place and how they can be placed within society. In a book called Consciencism written by Africans socialist revolutionary Kwame Nkrumah the author takes an radical look at the notions of philosophy and ideology that can help us better place Zapatismo (ideology of the EZLN) within the context of the world it fights against. Nkrumah argues using examples from Greek and popular western philosophy that philosophies “were reflections of social currents, is a reflection of real social conditions and conflicts. He then went one step up and expressed that “An ideology, even when it is revolutionary, des not merely express the wish that a present social order should be abolished. It seeks also to defend and maintain the new social order which it introduces.” The relationship is that the philosophy of a society or a group defines the terms on which humans must interact with the world and an ideology is the program that develops out of those terms. Part of those terms is definitions of words and concepts. In the past in America “human” was explicitly defined in the context that being be white and of European descent, thus excluding blacks from being human. That was a philosophy which became contested by the abolitionist movement in the United States with their philosophical assertion that to be “human” should and was not contingent on being white and that blacks too were human and thus deserving of certain freedoms. This is the context on which we have to deal with these terms revolution, and liberation as a reflection of a certain philosophy which in the case of the EZLN is radically different than from even other leftist organizations and groups.

Taking the mindset of looking at these words in the context of philosophy and ideology we can now begin to analyze them. We can begin with the term revolution. The term revolution when talked about in the United States usually elicits one of two ideas, police states, and anarchy as the possible end results of revolution. This idea of revolution is very much engrained in the current discourse on social change in America where change is akin to revolutionary change (“losing our country”) and is linked to these negative outcomes. In both cases the political outcome is to stifle and counter any voice which either rejects our agrarian, conservative past or criticize current American society as inadequate and ripe for overthrow. The interesting note is that when coupled together what is really being said is that the only acceptable change is one that America proposes and implements which goes along with the self-concept of America being somehow revolutionary even today, such as seeing ourselves as the “defender of democracy in the world” which assumes that we have some special legitimacy being one of the first modern democracies to be able to fill that role.

Now revolution for the EZLN is something very different. Normally even among other Marxist, basically the army, movement, and positions within the revolution are supposed to be semi-permanent. These concepts are seemingly lost on the EZLN as their program is radically different.

The EZLN operates with the philosophy that they purpose is to eventually serve no purpose. In other words they seek to reach a point where the EZLN is not needed for the functioning of the society they are currently trying to create. In contrast to American revolutionism and paranoid left wing revolutionism they see themselves as expendable in the long term and this is shown in a number of instances. One was the National Democratic Convention that they held in August 1994 where Subcommandante Marcos stated (in reference to white ribbons being tied around the ends of EZLN soldier’s weapons “Those ribbons signify the purpose of our weapons; they are not arms to be used in confrontation with civil society. Those ribbons on the guns represent, that everything is temporary and that the cause is transcendent of the individual participating in it. In this way revolution unlike in the west and in socialist traditions is built on top of not personalities (Marx, Washington, Franklin, or Lenin) but the ideas of the revolution and the faceless sacrifice of the individual will to the goals of the revolution. This idea is also reflected in the organization of the EZLN itself. According to Josée Johnston “Although the military is organized in a typical, hierarchical command structure, strategic political and organizational decisions are made at the community level, let alone a violent

The other idea that we can deal with in relation to the EZLN is the idea of liberation. Liberation is a term that is often used in class based revolts and even in mainstream politics (Civil Rights Movement for instance) to an extent in the west. When we look at what liberation constitutes and is composed of in the west we have to look at it in the context of  the dominant political reality. Our news media recently have used liberation to describe the outcomes of events such as the Egyptian uprising of 2011 and other pro-democracy movements through the late 20th-early 21st century. What all these uses of liberation have in common is that one, and even discussions on vote rigging in America today. All these issues are talked about in terms of securing freedom for people to have their voices heard. The second conception of freedom is seen in how the west looks at countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, and other nations where one has the same right to vote as in America but capital and corporations are heavily regulated. The breakdown of similar conditions in Western Europe and socialist African states in the 70’s and 80’s is seen as a victory for freedom and a kind of “liberation” from the tyranny of the “state and big government”. What we see here is that even for oppressed groups in the west liberation is constructed within the framework of capitalist democracy, never outside it and even more importantly if you seek freedom from corporate interests or the market itself (reflected in the Bolivian and Venezuelan politics for instance) then instead of promoting liberation you are now becoming an dictator or freedom hating because in our society capital (money) has rights outside its use to society at large.

The socialist tradition rejects this analysis in favor of liberation being idealized as the freedom from capital (aka socialism) and the means of production being owned by the people (logically managed by the state democratically). The reality of the situation is that much like in the discussion on revolution they pre-suppose that the “Party” or “Movement” will be the instrument of liberation. The idea of the “vanguard” comes from this. Popular in early socialist revolutions up till the 60’s it posited that the vanguard of smart

In contrast to these two prevalent conceptions of liberation the EZLN as we seen above sees itself as temporary and is a product of this philosophy and their ideology, for us, nothing”. The EZLN places itself as the servants of the people versus its leaders. This makes liberation for them the people being free from not a particular government (namely the Mexican one), or from a specific kind of tyranny but from the whole ideological structure that creates the oppressive Mexican government for instance. It’s in other words more about being free from the ideas and psychological constraints of the capitalist system and from the cult of personality and “Party” that has been built up around other socialist movements. For them economic globalization creates conditions where their struggle is seen as nothing more than another instance of a global revolution against capitalism and it’s agents. As I quoted them in the beginning of this paper they see even their organization which itself is a reflection and critique of Mexican society as an eventual roadblock to be overcome. Another example of this conception of liberation is this, “To demand that the revolutionary armed forces not intervene in matters of civil order or the disposition of capital relating to agriculture, commerce, finances, as these are the exclusive domain of the civil authorities

What does all of this mean? Why does it matter what the Zapatistas think about revolution and liberation? I believe that simply the fact that they have defended their piece of land for 16 years versus the much more powerful and well-armed Mexican government and kept the support of the people speaks to the power that their ideas hold. They in their small revolt in southern

All in all much like how America revolutionized the idea of democracy and how Karl Marx changed what could be a viable social organization for human the EZLN and their experience in revolution has given us another way to look at revolutions not as bloody

Marcos is all the exploited

What I get from quotes like this is that Marco is all the oppressed and  his speeches, who can speak to their people and move them to revolution and with the same words also speak to the world and perhaps bring out the Marcos who’s in us all.

This speech served as the first quote I saw from the Zapatistas and the basis for my entire analysis of their political culture and aims. The article it’s quoted in is based around looking specifically at the structure of the civil institution of the Zapatistas and making a judgment about their radical democratic society. The paper itself gives much insight into the social psychology of the group and was the best source material on the group by far.

-Nkrumah

This book was written in the calm before the storm that was the African De-Colonialization Movement. The book’s major thesis is that Africa needs to adopt a new political philosophy, and traditional Africa and uses these experiences to argue for a socialist organization and society.

- Research - this is pretty obvious

- Education - zoos allow average people to see wild animals with their own eyes and learn about them. The intention is that by educating the public

- Conservation - zoos foster the opportunity for international breeding programs of threatened and endangered animals

Issues that complicate these purposes:

- Not enough space for animals.

- Lack of genetic diversity in breeding programs. 

- It is not easy to reintroduce animals into the wild. 

- Zoos promote the idea that animals are a commodity for the entertainment of humans. 

- Research conducted in zoos does little or nothing to shed light on the lives of free-range animals.

1329225474.0,pp1k0,Reddit and Ayn Rand,,40,17,67,"I find the relationship between Reddit and Ayn Rand extremely fascinating.

For those of you who don't know Ayn Rand, among her beliefs she thought a man could rape a woman if he felt he could gain any kind of advantage from it and the most of her ""love scenes"" actually consist of the ""hero"" raping the ""love interest"", I am not joking. Because in Rand's ""philosophy"", a man can do anything he wants for the sake of self interest. Rand's man is above morals and above society, and more than all above the government. In Rand's crazy world, manual labor does not exist and is not necessary, it's the intellectuals who keep the world running through economy. To prove that Rand was a sociopath

&gt;is born with a wonderful, because he has no organ for understanding, the necessity, meaning, or importance of other people ... Other people do not exist for him and he does not understand why they should.

Rand actually planned to write a novel having Hickman as the main hero. Hickman's claim to faim was to having kidnapped

I've read The Fountainhead a while ago, which was written by Rand herself and was extremely faithful to the novel (horrible dialogues and it even has the long-ass speech). Still, I suggest everyone to watch the Fountainhead movie because it explains a lot of things about modern society, American and International.

Not let's get to reddit. Reddit **really really** hates Ayn Rand. Every time Ayn Rand pops up, because of his adherence to Objectivism (I still cannot understand why would an Objectivist found something as altruistic as Wikipedia, by the way). Every time someone mentions Ayn Rand, he gets downmodded, unless he/she's insulting her.
This would be okay with me if redditors didn't agree with every single idea Ayn Rand expressed in her body of work! Let's make a summary.

**Extreme Libertarianism?** Check. Reddit believes every man is entitled to earn as much money as possible without the filthy government trying to get its hand on it. Capitalism is perfect and a redditor would kill himself rather than admitting that the ""free market"" is just an illusion and that monopolies indeed exist. ""It's the government's fault!""

**Belief that society wouldn't exist without the ""creators""?** Check. The ""creators"" for Ayn Rand are the intellectuals who bring progress and ought to make money. Does that remind you of anything? Redditors believe they are intellectuals and,

**Disregard for poverty and celebration of richness**. Check! Redditors **hate** poor people. I would say some redditors were poor themselves and much of the hate for the poor is actually self-loathing. Redditors hate poor people

**Disregard for morals and laws**. Check. Redditors are no anarchists, which has mislead them to believe that morals=religion, when in fact they are two separated things which often overlap. Which brings us to:

**Man is god of all things.** I'm a green and it's painful to see how disrespectful redditors are for all things non-human. Redditors actually believe technology is the answer to everything and have complete disregard for environmental and animal issues. They'll mock you for being a vegetarian

**Sexism, their stance on consent issue isn't that different from Rand's. They don't really care about their partner's consent and will often brag about ""false rape"" and ""lowering the age of consent"". Reddit's most recent fiasco and reddit's wave of pedo apologists again proved that redditors feel entitled to pursue their self-gratification in any way possible, with disregard for possible victims or consequences. 

And there are many points which I haven't addressed because of my ignorance, essays, biographies and The Fountainhead.

The only thing on which Reddit significantly differs from Ayn Rand (and maybe the most important) is altruism. Reddit has proven to be pretty altruistic at times. But even the altruism is done in the name of ""reddit did X"". Which isn't a bad thing

What I find most remarkable about this whole deal is that reddit would universally agree to hate on a someone whilst agreeing with pretty much said person represents. Steve Jobs is another example, except weed legalization. 

I still don't know what conclusion I could get out of all this, which as far as I know is the plot of ""Atlas Shrugged"". And reddit's obsession with legalized rape is what worries me the most. Redditors are actually the result of Rand's insane preaching.  ",,False,,t5_2t5sa,False,,

The dictionary definition of creepy is ""causing fear or unease."" This immediately leads to a few things:

I am a woman and I have been a feminist since before I even knew the word ""feminist"". One of my first memories is being upset that I couldn't go outside without my shirt on at 6 even though all the boys did (it was really hot outside). I have had a sense of the inequality between men and women for a long time, mainly with my mom and her wife, and visiting my dad from time to time who was always talking about liberal politics. I think all of this may have contributed to this feeling I will explain in just a second. 

Fast forward to now, which I've always been fascinated with. So since I've decided I wanted to be a nurse, I've had this stress or pressure or something nagging at me, telling me that I should try to be a doctor instead so I'm not living up to stereotypes about women being nurses and men being doctors. I have this feeling like I somehow need to prove to all those shitty men out there that don't think women really are as capable, that lots of women can be doctors.

I recognize that this in itself is a shitty idea, and c) that nurses somehow aren't as important or cool as doctors (which just isn't true). But I can't let go of the feeling that I'm letting down my gender and all the struggles by other women to get us to this point, by not living against the stereotype and being a nurse. I should also add that though I know I am intelligent enough to be a doctor, I am bipolar and having anxiety issues that are not really conducive to going through the training a doctor needs to go through. This is almost another reason to do a ""told you so"" by trying to be a doctor and show that even those with severe mental illnesses can succeed, but in reality it does make life very hard at times and would be extremely difficult to do. :-(

This is obviously because the Indian-American experience is extremely different from the experience of an Indian in India like me.

I know others feel the same. I always want to ask what it is exactly that's driving these preferences. My hypothesis is that it's all based in bigotry to some degree.

I'll make another example, your religion of birth. And if you happen to date/marry someone that ISN'T your religion then it is encouraged for them to convert. This is prevalent in Christianity and Judaism, and those are the religions I'm most familiar anyway with so I'll just speak about them (hopefully someone familiar with Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Greek orthodox, etc can comment!). I've had a lot of Jewish friends who have basically been forbade by their families to date/marry outside of their religion (and remember with Judaism we can also consider this a culture/ethnicity). Some of my friends were more liberal and didn't care for this, yes, but just the idea of refusing to view all people equally and choosing *only* to marry

But what can be done about this? And how do you even argue against this mentality, and should, openly and happily date or have sex with any person aligned with my sexual orientation.

I'm just not sure what they are. I'll also admit that I don't know very much when it comes to cisgendered/transgendered people, but my point of view is probably biased. This is why I want to talk about the intersectionality of all of these ""preferences"" that people have.

I saw a [post on prime](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14q31i/the_white_supremacists_are_definitely_becoming/) that touched on immigration issues and I was wondering what SRSD thought about immigration in general. Take this comment:

For me, *is an American* in every sense of the word except immigration status, but still faces deportation (among many other challenges).
 
But I never considered the notion of immigration restriction itself as a form of oppression - I always thought about the (piss-poor) implementation. Can a nation restrict immigration (in any fashion) without denying basic human rights? Is there a ""cost"" of unrestricted immigration to consider?

Over the last couple of days I've been taking sexy pictures of two of my room mates (one male bodied and one female bodied) for two separate projects that they're doing.  They're both pretty good friends, taking the dude's pictures was a much easier process for me, it was easier for me to communicate and work together with him, and I feel like the pictures we took came out much better. 

Comparing both processes, but I think a part of this is that I have fairly specific requirements in a partner, and the overall dating pool is much smaller for gay men than for straight women.

First, when my father died, I lived the last two years until I turned 18 and moved out on my own with my mother. So, my initial cultural exposure was Mexican, my first language was Spanish, etc. but I ended up growing up more with the white parent. I now again live in the predominantly Mexican area that my father did.

1) What this has basically led to is me not being Mexican enough for Mexican people and simultaneously not being white enough for white people. Pretty much as soon as I was old enough to consider such things, at times I do feel like sort of an uncle tom about this. Should I feel bad about basically ""abandoning my heritage?""

2) I do identify as Mexican-American, but I try to keep that confined to things where my experience actually does differ because of it. However, I've always been extremely frustrated with Mexican-American immigrants or those in immigrant families that support restrictive immigration policies. I feel like I might be stepping over some boundaries in viewing and discussing this issue (that I do feel rather strongly about) from a ""Mexican-American perspective."" Is this something that it's appropriate for me to do if I only identify as such because it's what other people call me?

3) Since I don't feel at home in Mexican-American or white spaces, usually with hip hop used as the primary example, and lately I have become more sympathetic to arguments against people that aren't black being involved or disproportionately represented in hip hop culture/community, but I can't really shake the feeling that I don't have anywhere else to go. This in particularly has been troubling for me lately because in the past few years I've begun to take an interest in and feel a (very likely unwarranted) connection with things of Black British origin (jungle/garage and British rude boy culture). I fear this may be due to it being similar to things that are attractive to me in African American culture, without me having to confront that this might not be appropriate for me since I don't live in England and thus haven't come into much direct contact with it.

People with body modifications are often overlooked, I believe that the choice of a person to modify him/rself should not have the extreme social consequences that it does. I think that these consequences are a result of a culture that is too judgmental towards and puts too much implied meaning into the act of body modification. Every day on [/r/WTF](/r/WTF), there are frontpage posts mocking modified people and assuming their motivations for modifying their bodies. As a gay, atheist, modified person, I've found that the majority of mistreatment by others in my life has been a result of my body modifications.

So, I think, because that also hinges on outward physical experience. It should be noted that I have body modifications so you can see where my biases lie. I would like to think that this perspective allows me to better see privilege and not instead cause me to see privilege where there is none, but I can never be sure.

7.	It is not assumed, ignorant, or uneducated. 
8.	My actions are not taken as representative of the whole unmodified community. My actions will not reflect negatively on other unmodified people. 
9.	My morals are not ever in question because of my unmodified appearance.
10.	 I can swear, without having people attribute these choices to my choice to not modify my body.
11.	  I can criticize our government and talk about how much I fear its policies and behavior without being seen as a cultural outsider. My participation in a political movement will not be seen as an invalidation of that political movement.
12.	 I will not be suspected of being more culturally similar to a foreign culture than the culture in which I live.
13.	 People will not talk down to me using slurs comparing me to more “savage” cultures. 
14.	 I have no difficulty finding neighborhoods where people approve of our household.
15.	 I can travel to a foreign country and not worry about being harassed by TSA agents or by the police of the country.
16.	 I will feel welcomed and ""normal"" in the usual walks of public life
17.	 I will not be mocked by my doctor or told that my current problems are a result of my lack of body modifications.
18.	 My psychologist will not tell me that my unmodified state is an issue of body dysmorphia.
19.	 There are role models on television and in history that look like me. People that look like me can be the protagonists of movies.
20.	 I can walk in public without people doing a double-take or staring.

Basically I'm curious how you justify killing animals solely for personal reasons while being socially progressive. Is speciesism not just another form of ableism (making a quality claim based on intelligence or mental aptitude) or do you think that humans are somehow fundamentally different (and more valuable) from the rest of the living world?

Then it's ok. AFlatCap said that if they guy told the girl this though:

&gt; We're having sex or its over.

Then it would be rape. This was the reasoning given:

&gt; Pressuring someone into sex after they say no is rape. Period.

It seems to me like a similar area is if a boss tells one of their subordinates ""I won't give you this promotion unless you perform oral sex."" The sex in this case isn't forced

We fall into this gray area though. Lets say there's a stripper. She's never directly told anything

In order to do my job well I need to have a very unbiased (as much as you can be with social justice I guess) and educated viewpoint; but many of my peers say I think too hard on the subjects at hand.

The “problem” as they call it is that I question and find issues in EVERYTHING. Any social construction you can think of, especially looking at their other recent ad campaign which caused such a stir, saying “it’s not for women.” On my Facebook status, a female friend said that this was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be, and that I needed to “chill.” She said advertisers have the right to promote for their audience and that as a woman she is not offended by that. 
	
This isn’t the worst of it though. There are countless examples that go along with this, but they are allowing it to continue just by becoming bystanders. 

So in looking deep into issues like sexism, politics, etc. and trying to question their social constructs, am I over-thinking social justice, or is this exactly what I should be doing? I will give more examples if need be. Thank you!

Caucasian, but it occurs to me that in the more general sense, Caucasian actually refers to a group of people who up until recently wouldn't have been classified as 'white', and are still subject to racism today. So in a sense it feels to me like we've co-opted a term describing a mostly disenfranchised people to describe the privileged. And I guess that kind of irks me.

Personally

I.e. if you like certain things or act in a certain way then your ethnic or racial association lays with a certain ethnic/racial group and hence you are entitled to appropriate culture and struggles of that ethnic/racial group.


**EDIT:** As requested by 3DimensionalGirl here is what I understand by trans-racial and trans-ethnic people:

* Trans-ethnic: people that claim being part of an ethnicity different to their native ethnicity. 

* Trans-racial: people that claim being a member of a racial group to which they don't belong.

To differentiate between ethnicity and race:

[""Race refers to a person's physical appearance, hair color, bone/jaw structure etc. Ethnicity, on the other hand, relates to cultural factors such as nationality, culture, ancestry
