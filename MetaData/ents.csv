I haven't been to a doctor in over 10 years, amirite?  So, as part of my ""getting healthy"" outlook, I've decided I ought to go in and make sure I'm in good health and have a blood test done just in case.

One of the biggest reasons I haven't gone to a doctor though is that I have my medical marijuana card - I'm in Michigan.  I have heard from others that a doctor can refuse to treat you if they find THC in your blood or you admit to having the card.  I am no good at defending myself

I worked a long day

But you, the line is long. Guess that's what I get for going to a headshop on 4/20"". Our owners were bringing food and drinks for free to people in line. You take care of us by buying shit, we take care of you. Nobody honestly complained and it was a great day to work.

We gave away over $1000 in a charity raffle

And after the long day of work, found out former employees smoke, and had a great time all day.

I was going to post this closer to 4/20

Hello my fellow ents.



I have been smoking

The type of high that i have managed to attain is a very productive, i am a full time student studying arts, im still maintaining a great daily social lifestyle, not to mention going to parties on the weekend and relaxation time watching tv and youtube . Im running atleast 2-4 hours a week and i still find the time to go rockclimbing about twice a week.

Now dont get me wrong here

I have been crafting my state of mind for many years, perspective and conciousness (which also entails periods of compleate lack of thought/internal dialogue.. But i digress). 

I have previously tried something simillar In which i consumed trees every day for three month which ended in a 'stoned out' as opposed to a 'stoned in' experience. I believe that this was because i was consuming wayyy too much (oz a week) and in the incorrect way for me (bongs(i dont appose bongs

But the biggest contributing factor to my state of mind has been my phylisophical and spiritual quest to attain a higher conciousness. This higher conciousness has been made greatly through sciebtific understanding in conjunction with my openess to understand ''mystical'' and shemanic experiences

So i hope to serve as an example for you fellow ends driven with self doubt about the

But let me heed to you these last thoughts...

-anything in exess is poison (universal law)
-relax your shoulders
-and you will always remember that your traveling in the right direction no matter how many detours it takes you to find the right one. The one that makes you feel right at home in your own two shoes

Peace my fellow ents and i hope this has helped you on your journey

Is it too much to ask...that people be given the right to do with their bodies as they choose when it harms no others? If people could legally grow their own plant in the privacy of their homes then your entire argument falls flat on its face. Please educate yourself

Marijuana laws are historically an end to an unjustified means. Whether it be to oppress black jazz musicians in the 20s and 30s

Ask yourself this:

Is it too much to ask that our government listen to the over 50% of the people

http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/record-high-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx

People's lives are ruined every day right here in America because of marijuana prohibition. A simple possession charge can begin a cycle of institutionalization that many never fully recover from.  Millions of patients cannot have access to cheap, you want everyone to blindly follow, say there is zero medicinal value...even in the face of an avalanche of real world subjective AND empirical data to the contrary. 

The worse part of your argument is that using marijuana does NOT cause violence across the border. The failed prohibition and resulting black market are to blame. Take away the prohibition and you take away the financial incentive for modern day bootleggers.  The drug war is the single most destructive policy our government has ever shackled us to

With all due respect

In Cognito we'll have nothing to hide.
Let's go incognito
And let the world believe we've died

Meet me in Cognito
Of course we'll have to color our hair.
The best thing about life in Cognito
Is that everybody's nobody there

Meet me in Cognito
Sure
But you'll look chic incognito
With your fake nose and Groucho moustache.

Meet me in Cognito
We'll soon leave our pasts behind us.
The present is always a mystery
As the future never fails to remind us.

Once we're alone in Cognito
We'll remove all of our clothes very fast
But though we'll be naked as jaybirds
At no time will we take off our masks.

Cinderella went incognito
And it's said she had a ball.
It's always midnight in Cognito
By the black clock at the end of the hall.

We're destined to be clandestine
Incognito is our very last hope.
I'll meet you where the sun don't shine
With a fake ID and some dope.

So
You know that i'll never tell.
We'll sneak through the back door of Heaven
And stroll unnoticed through Hell.

Incognito
Incognito
There
Incognito
Incognito
Where truth tells all the best lies.

Long story short, permanent or temporary. 

I've settled on Canada

I have at least a year to prep, I can buy layers anywhere. But what I CAN'T deal with is an area that is going to hassle me about smoking dope more conservatively than other places - at that point I might as well just stay in California, you know?

So, I've smoked more times than you can count on both hands. I've gotten pretty high before, experienced bodily effects before, but nothing like last night.            

I went over to my friends house for 4-20 at 10PM. We had some pot brownies, and that was everything I had for the night. I didn't know where the pot had came from but we share it all the time so I thought nothing of that.             

The weirdness started with a tingling on my tongue, my tongue kept folding back into my mouth and I wasn't sure if it was doing that more than normal or I was just hyper-aware of it. A strong tingling also started in my groin region.                     

The next thing was real-time gaps in memory. I would say or do something, did I really just do that?"". Like I would touch the table or pull up my pants, then a second later not be sure if I had actually moved at all. I would tell a story to someone and then I would be sitting there, and I wouldn't be sure if I had ever told the story or if I had just been sitting there thinking about the story, and memory of what the story was would quickly fade away into just an impression of what it was. I started asking one person right after each story to quickly say what the last thing I told them was about. Not helpful as I got two word answers like ""uh, take chances?"" and I wasn't sure if I had told a full story about taking chances or if I had just muttered take chances, or if what I said to them (if I had said anything at all

By this point my vision kept blanking out and my entire body felt so tingly that I couldn't feel it touching anything, so it wasn't like I had lost that functionality, more like it was in my head I guess.                                     

I went to the washroom and somehow used it perfectly and everything, I would move my hand from the pillow to the blankets and not be sure I had moved it until I double checked, or could only make my hands feel something if I rubbed it between my fingers for a long time and focused my mind on my hands.                    

I woke up at 10 today and some of those effects were still continuing, just small spots where it would get a bit fuzzy, but again if I focused I could function well. Got home no problem.           

It's 12PM now,in waves. Every once in a while I become aware of what my tongue is doing but at the same time it feels a bit numb.

I've been living in Charlotte, and what kind of culture I should look for.


Moved here for an 9-5 job and am in my very-early 20s. Unsure how to make friends in the area without a college social network. I know a lot of kids my age are having this problem as they graduate and chase pay stubs in new cities. My job isn't the appropriate place to seek out ents - it's a mystical ""career"" thing people whisper about in the shadows.


I live with my boyfriend


Where should I look for young-ish people with interests similar to ours? We have a lot of trouble communing with other young-professional types


We also love tabletop! I own a pretty nice selection of board games that are currently gathering dust without friends to play with. Looking for a poker circle too.

I'm 20 years old
So why am I here fellow ENTS? Well my schedule and obligations have seriously hindered my ability to maintain any friends locally. I get kinda lonely. One of my favorite parts about being an ENT is having fellow ENTS around to shoot the breeze with. I decided to post on here looking for a friENT in my area.
So here's some quick info about me - I smoke! - I play video games competitively - I dance - I workout avidly and love fitness - I love movies - I love people
So if you live in the Dallas area and want to make a friend I'm right behind ya.
