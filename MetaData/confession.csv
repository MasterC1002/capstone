I know reddit likes to crucify cheaters

Six months ago, safely stuffed into my jacket pocket. However, one must've slipped loose when I left for work that morning, because when I came home I found my wife sitting on the couch with the most furious look on her face and one of the pairs of panties sitting on the coffee table. My wife just looked at me as I looked down at them then slowly stalked off to our bedroom. 

I don't know why the idea came to me

Quick as a flash and quiet as a ninja

It was honestly impressive. I bet I got undressed and redressed in all of five seconds before I was headed up the stairs after my wife. 

I found her sitting on the bed, ""Honey, it's not what it looks like.""

Then I dropped my pants and let my wife see me

We had a long talk after that. My wife was confused, but it was minor compared to the fury of earlier. In the end, she was perfectly accepting of it and encouraged me to continue to do so if it made me happy, but never to hide it from her and to not let our children know.

Late one night following al party, and passed out in her bed.  There were people sleeping on the couches and in the guest room.  She had no place else to sleep.  I offered to give her my bed and sleep on the floor.  She told me to move over and crawled into bed with me.
  
We talked for a little while, because he was a fucking tool, and she made fun of mine for being a ""superficial cunt.""  
  
At one point she dropped the pipe as I was passing it back to her, trying to get comfortable, when she slapped the sheets back.  I had a raging hardon tenting in my boxers.  
  
She giggled and laughed at first
  
""It's not you
  
""I know.""  
  
(It was.)  
  

She turned away from me
  
After a minute or so of silence she said
  
""We could
  
""Should we?""  
  
""Probably not.""  

  
By this point I was almost touching her butt.  She moved and felt me.  ""We're not blood
  
We talked about it a bit, and how we shouldn't do some other stuff.  
  
""No sex
  
""And no kissing
  
We had established the rules.  She was practically grinding her butt against me.  
  
She turned and grabbed me
  
We didn't cuddle or anything after and she was gone by the time I woke up the next morning.  I didn't see her all day.  
  
That night, but not about the night before.  She went inside, said she'd be up in her room doing stuff.  There was a look she gave that I would come to know.  
  
That night we went down on each other and 69'd, eventually it was almost every day after school.  
  
The first time we had sex was an accident.  She was giving me a massage on my bed and when I flipped so she could work my front
  
She asked if she should stop.  

I said she should.  
  
She asked if I wanted her to stop.  
  
I said no.  
  

  
From there sex became as regular as oral.  There was a period of about two weeks where we fucked every day.  That was when we started kissing and sleeping in the same bed.  
  
That was when she got pregnant.  
  
She didn't tell me at first.  I noticed something was different about her.  She was getting fucked up almost every day.  She denied it
  
Once she told me I offered to do whatever she wanted.  She asked for the money
  
We stopped fooling around after that.  Things were only awkward for like a week or so before we got back to our original stepbrother/stepsister relationship.  I started dating a girl she didn't like.  So she dated a guy I didn't like.  We were passive aggressively trying to make each other jealous.  
  
We're both dating someone the other doesn't like now.  We only see each other a few times a year, I usually pull out.  Unless she doesn't want me to.

So Kate, fourteen years of my life where I spent everyday afraid of meeting someone from the family. Not even my parents believed me, Kate. I guess you were that convincing, eh?


Fourteen years you did not own up Kate, I woke up every fucking night, sweating, afraid, trembling.... Guess what Kate. I STILL DO.


Your parents, her husband, my parents, your boyfriend, your friend Shaye and that feminist bitch of our aunt.. Everyone has a copy of that ENITRE skype convo in their email. Every fucking one. It doesnt even begin to pay for what you have done to me and what you repeatedly refused to own up to.
Remember when you told me yesterday to talk to a professional and get help? Guess what, it scares me. For that.
You got played bitch! And FOURTEEN YEARS of Fuck you.


***From a post below.*** (Added for context)

Sorry
Kate is my cousin
I spent months scared shitless about her getting pregnant with my child. Finally when I decided to speak to a family member about it, she played it perfect. Apart from two people in my extended family, no one offered me any supporting words. For them I was everything that was wrong. Kate was the exploited poor soul. She had support, she had friends, she had cousins. Her friends made my life hell in school. My parents never bothered to listen to my side. The idea of a girl taking advantage of a guy was not very (for the lack of better words) convincing to them.
I begged her for years to help me
The biggest bitch was our aunt. Some sort of feminist activist (I dont know what she is exactly. She writes some blogs and all and I have seen her quoted on reddit a couple of times.). She was the one who made my life hell the most. She made me look (even though I was 13ish) like I was some perverted fuck. I hope (even more than Kate) she listens to that entire conversation. I hope.

***Updates***

I still cant bring myself to check emails. That email went to about 15 people and I dont know what to expect. But I switched on my phone to a flurry of voicemails from my mom and one from her brother and one from another cousin. Mom is crying in a bunch of them

Oddly

I am planning to seek help. I am going to talk to someone this week. You guys should know you all are unbelievably cool people and that I will forever be in your debt. I guess I am trying to say thanks. 


***Update 2***

So I looked down and realized that I still had them gonads and decided to check on emails. Expected the worst, you are a good man, I guess. 

Her brother called and texted a bunch of times. He is being a dick. The one time I picked up

Its not like I didnt give her a chance to come clean. I asked for 3 years

Looks like I will have thanksgiving this year! :) Thanks y'all. Again

***Update 3***

I want to start off by saying a big thanks to y'all. I did not expect this to help me so much

I dont have an agenda. Some people have suggested via comments and PM to talk to police with this evidence. While that might be the right thing to do, I should talk to a lawyer  if I need to pursue this. But before I even go to one, I would really like to know if this is possible. More than personal, this is a matter of principles. She shouldnt be using a lie to establish her theory as valid. Even if one person reads this, it could have some effect on them. She mentions that she knows both parties. I want those statements removed from the so called ""articles"". Is this something which I should pursue or is is a waste of time?

To the good things.

I spoke with my mom. She cried, I cried more, we spoke. She said she could have handled this better. I told her thats all I needed to hear. Looks like I am going home this Thanksgiving.

It hurts so much to know my daughter was suffering, but there is no point in dwelling on that. 

I know every parent thinks their kid is amazing. I'm not exception to that. But I wish you all could have known her. I swear she was destined for great things. She was so kind and caring, she would sometimes get so upset by the stories, that she would cry. I never understood that, because although bad things happening to people is sad to me, since I don't know them on a personal level, it's hard to feel anything other than a distant sadness. My daughter seemed to feel everyone's pain very deeply. She said she wanted to write stories and paint pictures that brought people joy, and that she wanted to use all the money she made to help the world become a better place. I think she would have done that, but she never showed me

My daughter was 20 when she passed. The last 2 years of her life was troubling, and I know I should just ignore them, but reading those interpretations put me in such a sensitive state that I couldn't handle seeing anyone calling my little girl something bad.

WARNING: Lots of text!",tweakofnature,1034,217,http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/15kycg/i_am_about_to_tell_you_something_reddit_something/, and removing the security tag (DVDs have these black/white strips inside that will trigger an alarm if they are not deactivated). I would then stuff the DVD in my pants and request to go buy a drink (in which I would really go to my car, I was allowed no money for myself). I didn't experience any kind of thrill from stealing

* Wait until Monday when it was just me and the General Manager.
3:30pm
* During this time, and I would promptly begin to deactivate them. In exchange for this, they would collect DVDs I wanted.
* Once completed I would do a ""fake transaction"" in case there were other customers in the store and pretend to take a credit card.
* After the fake transaction my friends would leave the store and I would retrieve my ""bag"" at a later time.

This operation went on for at least two years and I amassed a collection of over 1000 DVDs as a result. None of the customers in the store question these blue collar people buying what looked to be hundreds of dollars worth of DVDs every Monday. At no point in time did I ever feel remorse of any kind for ripping off this company by the THOUSANDS. In fact, but eventually I stopped caring. My parents never said a word to me about it.

At the store I worked in, when he was picking up his reserves I happened to notice that I accidentally overcharged him a reserve (something like $22.99 instead of $19.99). You take reserve tickets in the register the same way as a coupon, and usually if a customer used a coupon the went over the price of the DVD it would just omit the change (for obvious reasons). At first, I thought it was going to omit the change, but this was different. 

Because Mr. Harms had pre-paid (pre-paid being the key word) he was entitled to change so new options appeared ""Cash or credit"", the wheels began to turn in my head. I learned that it was potentially possible to remove cash from the register without a shortage appearing on the end of the night report. But first, I needed to learn what exactly the manager does at the end of the night. So for a few weeks (I usually always closed) I watched intently what kind of reports are printed out and what the manager actually accounts for. What I noticed was rather alarming, but beneficial to my cause.

My General Manager only checked the cash totals, write the date on them, and throw them carelessly into a plastic bin. Once the bin was full, they were discarded in the trash. So once every 90 days they were discarded, helping my cause even further. I kept this entirely to myself and told absolutely no one. In fact, as I type this, this is the first time I have ever disclosed this information. 

So this started out with me writing up a fake reservation tickets, I would glance at the closing paperwork and see these outrageous dollar amounts in the reserves. But true to form, the managers never checked and signed off on it blindly. This was mostly due to the fact because the closing managers lived considerably far from the store and wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

I had this scam going strong for the next year and a half. I was literally making $600-$700 a week from the cash scam in the register. That's the equivalent of making almost $34

You're probably wondering how no one saw me do this in the store, just lacked any kind of common sense. Me, on the other hand, I am very observant and calculating. You're also probably assuming the corporate office had copies themselves of these reports at the end of the night with OUTRAGEOUS totals in the reservation redeems. Another thing on my side was the fact the company who owned the retail stores I worked at changed hands three times in this year and a half period. Even when the company settled in under the new owners I still went undetected. It was a stupid mistake on my part that led to my downfall.

Even before this event I will explain a safety plan I devised. I want you to know that I am a neurotic over-thinker. I over-think everything

A loaded question is a question  which contains an unjustified assumption (e.g. 

Example:

The question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" presupposes that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, then the question is loaded.

Since this example is a yes/no question
	1. ""Yes
	2. ""No
	
The proper way to answer that loaded question would be to say ""I have never beaten my wife."" But most people are stupid and would fall for it which would lead the interrogator into more questions until you inevitably crack. I was determined to not let this happen to me. Another thing, let me explain how this came to an end for me.

October 19, and I was finding it difficult to conduct my cash scam. Mainly because there were A LOT of customers around and it was just me and the General Manager. I didn't explain this before, but the cash scam takes one minute (minimum) to complete. I had to fill out a reserve ticket and then conduct the register operation… and our registers were OLD, like late 1980s DOS based computers OLD OLD OLD so that also meant SLOW SLOW SLOW. Sometimes, what I would do is conduct the scam, but retrieve the cash later (if it was busy). However, this particular day was so outrageously busy I conducted the scam but could not remember if I removed the cash from the drawer since I already had a large amount of case in my pocket. In retrospect

At the end of the night, but I worked the day after that with my General Manager again. I asked him if he got into a lot of trouble and he simply said ""No."" But it wasn't a suspicious ""no."" So I carried on as always (I still needed the extra cash for my Minnesota trip). So I conducted my cash scam without a hitch and I figured everything would be ok. This would not prove to be the case. At the end of the night, I noticed my General Manager was VERY CAREFULLY looking at the register tape (the records of every single transaction for the day) and he abruptly stopped at one and highlighted it. Needless to say, this freaked me the fuck out but I opted to stay calm and continue my work.

He didn't say anything out of the ordinary to me when he was done with his paperwork, I phrased it as I had to work on a school project (I'm not that dumb) but I was really going to Minnesota on a fishing trip. After three days passed, I came back to work and ohhhhhh man were things instantly different. This other part-time employee looked SCARED TO DEATH at the register so I asked her what was wrong. She told me a loss prevention detective was in the store and he wanted to interview every employee. I played it off like everything was ok, but I knew… I knew this was the day I was mentally preparing for… the inevitable interrogation. So I clocked in and went about my work routine when suddenly the General Manager comes out of the office and pulls me aside and tells me I need to talk to the LP Detective. I ask what it's about, and he just says ""he wants to talk to everyone."" But I knew, I was the main event for this LP Detective. 

I'm basically SHOVED into the backroom and this Cliff Huxtable sweater wearing guy smiles at me

LP Detective: Hell there tweakofnature

He asked me my full name

He then asked me my personal definition of theft. To which I answered ""Taking something that doesn't belong to you.""

Meanwhile, he knew it was me, he just needed me to say so otherwise he didn't have a case (gotta love that word ""circumstantial"")… so I decided to play right back. Normally, the interrogator will ask personal questions such as ""what you aspire to be?"" Normally the perp would answer honestly and then the questioning would take a more negative turn in an attempt to break the suspect for example:

He did ask me: ""So what did you aspire to be when you were young?"" (career wise)

If I had answered honestly with "" I wanted to be a filmmaker"" he most likely (speculative on my part) would have taken the questioning to either ""Looks like you just didn't cut it

Instead

**LP Detective** : What did you aspire to be?

**tweakofnature** : How long have you worked for (store name)?

**LP Detective** : Have you ever stolen anything before?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever given anything away before?

**LP Detective** : Do you ever get angry?

**tweakofnature** : Have you ever been happy?

He starts to get real irritated with me and accuses me of not being cooperative

**LP Detective**: ""tweakofnature

(I lie and say I don't)

**LP Detective**: ""It's just like a normal question

**tweakofnature**: Ok…?

**LP Detective**: ""Have you committed any form of theft this week?""

Here are the facts up to this point:

* All of the evidence he had against me was entirely empirical and circumstantial; nothing concrete.
* No one witnessed me doing these things I was being accused of.
* He could connect the dots and see that the same dollar amount was taken on only days that I worked leading to a conclusion that it was most likely me
* I was always quiet and kept to myself at work
* The General Manager and the Assistant Manager were in financial turmoil at the time

I told the LP Detective… YES! That I had committed theft that week. He looked surprised by my admission of guilt. He then asked ""Could you describe what you did."" I told him ""I stole three DVDs""

It was obvious he did not want to pursue this petty theft and wanted to bring the conversation back around to the cash scam. So he asked ""Thank you for your honesty, and he said ""Did you ever maybe take any money out of the drawer?"" (notice: I mind-fucked him in such a way he forgot about the loaded questions). I told him never and that it was impossible, WOULDN'T THE DRAWER BE SHORT??? Then this stupid asshole decided to explain my own cash scam to me and I just pretended like I didn't understand it. He tried placating and ego I didn't have by saying ""If you think about it, this scam is rather ingenious!"" I just kept telling him I didn't understand how it could work. So he explained it probably three times and that's when I brought up ""Wouldn't this have shown up on a report?"" His face went to hard scowl and he just said ""maybe someone wasn't doing their job correctly.""


So now he tries scaring me by describing these hidden cameras they sometimes put into stores that are the size of a pin head. Before he even finished I flat out asked him ""Do you have me on video doing this?"" and he responds ""Are you sure you want me to answer that?"" DUMBEST THING YOU COULD HAVE SAID SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, and he knows it. He ends up calling the police to report my theft and exits the back room telling me not to leave.

He ends up coming in and out of the backroom intermittently trying to get me to confess to the money scam, but he couldn't prove it.

After arguing with the cops, the LP Detective takes one look at me and tells me to leave the store and never come back. To which my reply was only: ""But why? I didn't do anything wrong!""

His face turned bright red

I heard several months later he was terminated (not because of me) because he royally fucked up another interrogation at a different store.

I apologize if there are any grammar/spelling errors. Once I started typing

^1 - I did that solely to fuck with him. He wasn't recording anything I was saying but merely writing it down. And if he wanted me to sign anything I would have refused and requested a lawyer.

I was sitting on my boyfriend's lap because there were a lot of people in the limo. It was winter and we all had a bunch of long coats and such on. Somehow he managed to slide his hand under the back of my coat and skirt. He started rubbing the outside of my underwear until he knew I was swollen and wet. I couldn't push his hand away or tell him to stop because that would have been a lot more obvious then just letting him do it. 

He slid his middle finger into me and started rubbing my clit with his forefinger. He alternated between finger-fucking me with the middle finger and rubbing my wet clit. The fact that I couldn't move or make any noise was driving me insane. He knew it was because I was so unbelievably wet it was almost hard for him to get friction going to make me come. Even through our clothes I could feel how hard he was. 

People were talking in low voices and staring out the windows and no one was trying to start any conversations since it was such a somber occasion. I stared out the window very intently as if lost in thought. I'm sure if anyone did look at me they might have thought the slight twitching of my face was due to me feeling depressed. 

Anyway

I still felt myself having little after-spasms for minutes afterwards and I squirmed around on his cock to give him a little more fun. Although soon he stopped me since sitting through the graveyard ceremony with a raging erection probably would have been a little disturbing.

I've been getting off on that memory for years.. since he's now my husband he's made me come in lots of public places. But I do feel the funeral guilt every time I'm at one now...

Background is that my daughter is an 8th-grader with amazing grades

Except for one kid who Will Not Let Up. He's constantly seeking her out at lunch, and laying into her. Calling her cunt, whore, and that's just where it begins. Every day, she's worried about running into him, and while the school takes a ""Zero Tolerance"" policy to bullying, that just means that every time she turns him in, and then he's let go. It's made every day for her a constant sort of torture

Since the school won't do anything constructive, other than moving her out of the school, and I don't want her running from this. He needs to be removed from the equation.

I'm not the violent type, I have decided to frame him for major (dealing) drug possession, which I am aware will probably ruin his life. I don't know if I'm feeling bad about it or nervous or excited, but I don't think there's any way to turn back now.

My dad survived the Holocaust and came to the US afterwards. He had a pretty good career here but personally and emotionally, alcoholic and abusive. All of his kids, myself included, had a pretty miserable collective upbringing, though I think he had mellowed out a little bit by the time I came around (I'm the youngest)... Or maybe he was just exhausted.

Anyway, he learned that the guard who had tormented (possibly even raped him, though he was vague on this point) him at Buchenwald was living in a certain South American country. I remember him sitting at his desk on Saturday afternoons when I was a kid, writing letters to congressmen and international organizations, demanding that this guy be taken into custody.

Nothing ever came of it. I went off to college and, I did some research of my own and became pretty sure that I knew where this guy was and who he was. Keep in mind that this was a different time--no internet, corruption even more endemic than it was now. 

I graduated and went into finance (I'm a Jew, got offered a pretty plum transfer to the certain South American country. I took it without hesitating and began making plans. Again, different time but it wasn't hard: being an American with money gets you lots of things in this world, after all.

The time came and despite almost chickening out

I was paranoid for about a year after that. I don't think I slept a wink for three or four months after it. But again

I told my dad about it and he didn't believe me. He was so far gone at that point, I don't know why I did it. I was young, I wanted to be some bad ass action hero. I had this view of myself as some sexy, international man of intrigue, not the dumpy, overweight stats nerd that I am.

My dad died a few years after. I never told any of my siblings

I don't have much sympathy for the man I murdered--if he'd been shot by GIs or rebelling prisoners during the war, those years in my twenties that should have been great, being miserable and paranoid, and thinking that somehow, it was going to make up for sadness we grew up with.",,False,t5_2qo2a,True

Anyway, I printed the graphs we needed, I typed the introduction and the theory/discussion (five pages total), I found the references, I did everything except draw the sketch of the experimental procedure, answer two discussion questions, caption the graphs

Problem is, so I still needed them to help too, you know, being a group project and all. We all sat down, and they all talked about going to the fucking beach for spring break, which, fine, but at least use the class period to work on the project. But no, and I just give them the benefit of the doubt and leave for break and maybe they'll have something, too. So hopefully they'll help me out with our project. 

So I come to class on Tuesday after break with all my shit, and my lab group sat behind me and talked about old Nickelodeon cartoons for the entire class. Seriously. Other groups were telling my group to shut their shit because they were trying to work. 

I tried emailing my professor about it since yesterday morning, and he basically told him that as long as it was getting done, it didn't matter who did what. 

I was scrambling tonight trying to fucking finish *everything* that no one else had touched

I logged into my student account online and dropped the fuck out of that class. This was the final week to withdraw, I'm going to be a fucking sleep, and they're going to have approximately none of the assignment finished. Even if they start from scratch tomorrow and really pound it, they still won't have time to finish. None of them have shit done because they expected me to do it, and I just decided that I don't care anymore. That may have been a shit thing to do, but keep in mind that I was prepared to turn in everything that I had done *if they had only replied to my emails and drawn a goddamn picture of our experimental set-up.* So, fuck it.

I sat in that shed for probably an hour or so crying. I went home to my empty house and cried more and showered.

He never spoke to me again but i still had to see him all the time and it made me sick.

Let me preface this by saying I know what I'm doing is wrong.  I know it has the potential to tear families apart, in fact I hide it from everyone in my life, even my closest friends.  Which is why it feels good to write this.  That's not to say I don't get anything from it, because I do.  But first a little context.

I'm 28, and have no problem meeting unattached women.

Three years ago I met a woman, we hit it off instantly.  She was still living with the guy, a cop, who wasn't quite abusive but certainly didn't treat her well.  

She was completely upfront about her situation and said she wasn't really interested in meeting anyone.  I told her I understood, I'd be happy to listen.  She seemed so taken aback that someone wanted to listen, that someone actually cared about how she felt, so grateful for some intimacy even on a platonic level, it just gave me a good feeling to know that maybe I was helping her in some way - at least in my mind.

So over the span of a couple days, the evening ends with Melissa bent over the hood of my car in her garage having the loudest orgasm I've ever heard (she lived in a high rise building with underground parking so husband wasn't likely to stumble on us).  After that, our dynamic pretty much turns physical.  We fuck everywhere.  My place sometimes, her place when her husband is at work, the car, the gym, the beach.  Frankly it's great.  It's hot

I think that's about where something clicked for me.  I wasn't really meeting women that I could see spending any amount of time with, acknowledged and appreciated.  The quid-pro-quo here, I got great sex and the feeling that maybe I had helped her out a bit.

Few weeks later

Here's where the shameful part begins.  Since then, but I will tell you that there are SO many women out there who are angry, hurt, feel unappreciated and unfulfilled.    They're everywhere.  I've had relationships with married women that I've met at the grocery store, gym, bookstore, malls, coffee shops, and bashful smile which is essentially an invitation to come talk to them.  So many beautiful women (inside and out) that just get ignored by their husbands.  MEN OF REDDIT - you want some insight into why your wife would cheat on you?  The number one complaint that I hear as the man lying in bed next to your wife, it means picking up on the subtle cues when they're unhappy or having a bad day and giving a fuck. 

Maybe to a certain extent I am taking advantage of these women or where they are in their life.  I used to tell myself that I was balancing it all out by giving them something that they were lacking at home.  Whether physical or emotional.

Yesterday afternoon something happened that really stung deep.  I know this is getting long so I'll try to wrap it up here quickly.

So one of the women I've been seeing lately, very pretty and sweet, married mother of 3.  We met a couple weeks ago at a bar when she was out with some girlfriends (Husbands of Reddit - another note, ""out with girlfriends"" is most likely time your wife is going to be talking to a guy like me.  Not saying all women are prone to infidelity, but I've met several women in scenarios like this.  Girlfriends keep their mouths shut.)

We start talking, I need a break.  need some excitement.  I'm open to sleeping with you.""  So a few drinks, I walk her to her car, we kiss and trade email addresses.  (Husbands of Reddit - all indicent communication takes place on Facebook of via email.  No phone.  Just sayin')

Next day I get an email telling how great it was to meet me and asking if I'd like to come to her yoga studio for a class  I accept and class is great.  We grab Jamba Juice afterwards......yadda, just one of those women that seems like she hasn't been touched or show attention in years.

So we've been doing this for a couple weeks now.  Same routine, just fun and enjoying each other.

Yesterday

So the door is locked, I put my hand on the back of her head and pull her face into the nook of my shoulder and we cum together.  She pull's her face away from my shoulder, kisses me and says ""that was fun.""  

As she starts to sit up and pull her hair into a pony tail, thinking I'm about to get the shit kicked out of me.  The guy is crying.  Hard.  Not even looking at me, but instead at his wife, naked, kneeling on a yoga mat in the studio he helped build for her.

And this.  Right here.  Is the absolute lowest moment of my life.  I feel like scum.  Worse than scum.  And I can feel myself start to tear up to thinking about this family that I just rained down disfunction on.  The kids.  And it's not like it was some fucking mistake.  It was me.  I sought this out for my own perverted self gratifying reasons.  I couldn't go fuck some trixie at a bar

I didn't say a word.  Pulled on my shorts

So I'm done.  I swear.  This is my confession and it will serve as a reminder of the pain I've already caused and the potential harm that my own fucked up behavior can bring not just to one person

From the bottom of my heart - to the families that my actions affected.  I am so very sorry.  I was immature

They are such caring boys. I am proud to be their mother. They will be do good things in the world. I love them. 

But then there is my son Ben*. He is fourteen and he terrifies me. I was raped one night jogging, I used to be a proponent of nurture vs. nature, and we couldn't be sure whether the baby was the rapists or my husband.

So I had the baby. And I loved him. I did nothing different. But the older he got the more I noticed that something wasn't right. He never learned to play well with others smaller than him. Those bigger, he'd be unbearably cruel. Punishment only made him be subtle.

He still terrorizes his younger brother. He's in therapy and has been diagnosed with an alphabet of symptoms

He is broken and I don't think anything can fix him. He's so big

He is going to do bad things. I created this monster and he is going to hurt other people. I won't be able to stop him. I sometimes wish he'd die in a car wreck

edit: I didn't think r/confession would be so judgmental. I would never physically harm him. God help me I love him. He's not always a monster. I held him as a small baby, they would tell you they wish there child had died in a car crash before they committed an atrocity.

After I posted about this I felt enough support and understanding here that I thought it's time I should tell my mother what I'd done. I didn't know how she'd react and I didn't expect it to be good because even someone mentioning it growing up would send her into psychiatric depression. We usually celebrate Thanksgiving with my aunt's family and I was going to make the trip this year. A couple days before I  ws exchanging emails about the trip with mom. I sent her an email saying that I have to speak to her. I didn't delay when we were on the phone, so I hung up. I later got a message from my stepdad telling me I'm not welcome there and that I'm lucky they don't call the police. I have to give her more time and hope she doesn't hate me forever, right now my Aunt told me she is staying with them and sleeping and started going on pills again. I know that my stepfather is just trying to protect her. He was actually nice growing up, but he'd go apeshit whenever he felt someone he loved was threatened.

As soon as I heard the front door open I jolted upright and began coughing my lungs out. I muffled my mouth as best as I could as my mom announced that she was home. I scrambled for an excuse for her not to walk down the stairs. Best I could come up with between coughing was that I wasn't clothed so to give me a minute.

When I was 14 I started having sex with my boyfriend. He was a bit older and we always used protection on top of me being on birth control. We dated until I was 19 and in college. He was nice, he still tries to make a move on me and to my knowledge he never got another serious girlfriend.  

Anyway, I was 100% sure it was from my previous boyfriend. 

I knew I didn't want an abortion and I knew I'd be okay to raise the baby on my own. I had a good paying job and my own place. Deep inside of me

So I spoke to my then boyfriend, he said it was fine. That he didn't want to be held back and that he wanted to finish his bachelors but that he'd be there and that he'd sign the birth certificate if I wanted him to. *wow... I'm getting emotional here*

Anyway

I had to endure him for weeks and weeks calling me names and telling me how bad of a mom I'd be. I was stressed

Then, there is no heartbeat. Your baby passed away."" 

The rest is very blurry. I didn't want to have my dead baby inside of me. I was induced the next day and within 2 hours I was holding my baby boy. I cried. My boyfriend cried. We cremated him and I refused the autopsy. 

Two years later, when both of my kids are sleeping, I rest in bed, start falling asleep and I hear a sweet little voice calling ""mum"". It's the sweetest little voice ever... Not a toddler voice, just a little sweet angel voice. I get then woken up... It's like it was real, that it happened, that my baby was there and was whispering in my ear. 

I am convinced it's because my first baby was ""a secret"" that most of my family has no clue

D lost control of his car and went down the embankment into a tree. I swerved to avoid the crash. I kept driving. I didn't stop. I felt like he deserved it and he should die for all the torment he caused me.

1369499270.0,1f19j7,I had sex with my sister,,713,209,114,"Yes. NQP. I really

A little about me: up until this last year I've been obsessed with success. When I was a little girl all I cared about was learning and grades and was skipped ahead twice. I was 2nd in my class of 900 in high school

My mother died in a car accident when I was 5. She was drunk
Our father was not suited to that role. He died two years ago
Both my parents were alcoholics; it was pretty much the only thing they had in common. My dad taught at a community college

In a perverse way

OK. So I've never had a relationship. The closest thing was my best friend / next door neighbor from when I was 10-16. I used to sleep at her house more or less every single night. I would bring my sister sometimes. 
As my friend and I went through puberty we started ""experimenting.""
By the time we were 13 we were having regular sex. Ever since I knew what being gay meant I knew that I was gay. My friend was just kind of experimenting. She would have boyfriends but she would always come back to me. 

I've had sex with well over 100 people. I have stopped counting. Mostly young women. About 20 or so men. I have hurt many people. It's my compulsion. I don't drink or do drugs, random 17 yr olds I've met online, and yes, some dudes too if nothing else was available. I once paid an 18 year old $3000 to spend a weekend with me.

[I'm realizing that any one of these things could be confessions on their own...]

My dad molested me, moved across the country and forgot about him. Unfortunately forgetting him sort of meant abandoning my sister and I feel terrible about that now. 

My sister did tons of drugs in high school. She drank all the time
I found out when I was 22 that our dad raped her on a regular basis. I realized how selfish I had been. She was 17

I didn't hear from her for 3 years. 
Then out of the blue I hear from her. She's living in NYC. OK. So I go to see her immediately. I drop everything. To my surprise she's doing well. She got a GED went to some community college. She lives in this terrific apartment in Brooklyn. I drill her on what she does for money. Turns out she's a call girl. She makes a ton of money. She told me she only does it about 20x/year and apparently that's enough for her to get by. I didn't know what to say. I wanted to scold her, she painted, and had a lot of really nice friends. I stayed for a week. We made plans for her to come see me for Christmas (5 months later). 

OK. So that's when it happened. I don't even really know how to begin. It's Christmas eve. We went out to dinner. She had a few cocktails and some wine. At dinner we talked a lot about sex. I have to admit that I was very curious about what her job was like and how it affected her love life. She was not exactly monogamous

When we came home she drank more wine that she had bought earlier. She got pretty drunk. We were on my couch and we were kind of cuddling up

As she slept in my arms
The next day she went back to New York.

We have a pretty distant relationship now, I turned her into just another sex thing. 

She has a million bucks now. She got some big stock tip or something (she's very cagy about the details; I get the impression it was from a john). She retired from having sex for money and now lives upstate and paints.

No Questions Please. I know. I'm sorry. I just don't want to talk about this. I want to let it die.

And to top it off I thought he was pretty hot. This guy, we'll call him Ethan, broke me off from the pack and we went to a different bar. Nobody knew he had interviewed me personally.

We went to a gay dance club and had a really fun time getting wasted and things got pretty heavy on the dance floor. Next thing I know I'm back at his place. Of course my body is telling me I want this, anal, everything.

1345252788.0,yeopv,I peed all over my ex-roommate's new house because she stole my food.,taltarni,573,78,82,"A bit of back story. I'm a twenty four year old female and she's twenty three. We'll call her Estelle because that was her name and fuck her.

We lived together for two years. I wouldn't say we were friends really

Anyway Estelle found a new house she wanted to move into. It was closer to the Melbourne CBD than our flat (our flat is about 12 kilometers away.) She was entirely entitled to leave and I didn't mind really. I'd just get a new roomie.

So a few weeks later Estelle was packed and good to go. On this particular day she was an hour away from leaving to go to her new house

I assumed by the time I got back she'd be gone; I spent more than an hour getting heaps of shit now that my flat was just mine. I also got a TONNE of food.

Anyway I got back and Estelle was still there. I didn't care although it was awkward because we'd said goodbye and I thought she'd be gone.

I unpacked all the food and put it away and then took a shower. She told me when I got out she'd be gone. 

When I got out Estelle was

Oh my God that bitch took all my food that I bought with my money. And I mean all my food

I knew Estelle's new house had to be on our computer's history; that was were she found it. After rummaging through it for close to fifteen minutes I found the address to her new house.  I got dressed and headed off to it.

When I arrived her car was there. Fuck it

And after an hour I knew that would be the case. I sadly began to crawl away from my hiding place

When I was certain she wasn't getting out or whatever I tried the front door. It was unlocked and I was thrilled.

The house was a lot nicer than my flat. I was jealous and also mad because she stole my food and and who the fuck steals food. 

I was wearing a skirt and I took off my underwear. I proceeed to run around the house with them in my hand trying to find somewhere to pee. It was the only form of revenge I could think of

So I elected for her bedroom. Basically nothing was unpacked but the carpet was a beautiful, pissing all over the carpet.  It felt good.

I finished

Fuck Estelle. She doesn't have a reddit but it she does fuck you Estelle I spent like two hundred dollars on all that food. 

It feels good to finally tell people about this. Goodbye. Also this is kind of a throwaway; I have had this account for a little while but didn't use it.

**Tl;dr: my roommate left to move to a new place and stole two hundred dollars worth of food. I went to her new house and pissed all over the carpet. I do not regret it.**

Still having ALL of the money that my dad paid me for basically doing his job, learn it inside and out within about a month, though this time I went to Youtube for tutorials on things I wasn't able to figure out. With my parents permission, I started using a fake name and began asking whoever had a bad logo/whoever was looking for a new logo if I could redesign it for them. After a few months of this, I had a solid and sizable portfolio.  After asking my dad how I could have people write checks to my fake name, he got me paperwork and we filled it out. If I'm correct I could be written to as ""Real Name operating under Fake Name"" or ""Fake Name"". So now, I design for some moderately big companies and will have made just below (not including taxes) $30, I put most of the money in the bank to save until I'm out of college.

they are nice, brother, uncles, aunts or grandparents.
I think in the back of my mind i have always hoped that one day i would find a way to break free of them all.
The thing is
could bring myself to do it. I saw an opportunity here and i took it.
The only other person who knows the truth about this is my cousin

Also

Here goes:

I was in town for a few days
years younger than me (she had just turned 18 2 weeks before this happened) and i thought i would check in and 
say hi to her and my aunt before i left for home
busy with work for her 18th birthday).

So we're all sitting in the living room enjoying ourselves and eventually me and her naturally drift off to her room (she is
an only child and ever since her parents' divorce she got pretty spoiled
as we always have
consequences/impact our words might have. She is the only person i can talk to about anything i want.

She starts telling me how much she's missed me and it's been too long
she recently broke up with her boyfriend of 2 years
""Why can't i just find a guy like you?"". I'm flattered and slightly weirded out
Instead of a hug

Things got pretty hectic from that moment; some yelling
trying to figure out how to handle this situation. My aunt is already blaming me
am independant while my cousin is still living at home with her mom and probably will for a few years to come. I can
handle being shunned
on her face. I take my leave with both of them crying. My aunt looks away for a few seconds and
I signal to my cousin that i will call her one of the following days. I really want her to know that she doesn't have
to feel bad about this.

Cut to a few days later. I've received phone calls from my mom
nothing to do with me
to her that there is no need to and I tell that it has been liberating in a way.

That is 4 months ago now. I still haven't heard from anyone other than my cousin
doesn't know). I've taken some time to think about everything
I've made it clear to my cousin that such a thing can never happen again
and never could. We have a special relationship and I hope we can keep it that way for a long time.

Some of the older kids in the neighborhood recognized me as the victim they wanted

I fought back, because it's a commonly referenced number, but that was what they counted, so that's what I recall) holding me down and beating on me, right out front on the playground, in between classes, with no teachers around to stop them.  But the black eyes I frequently wore would migrate from one side to the other in the annual class pictures

I grew up believing my da would eventually kill me.  Once he held me over the side of a skyscraper's observation deck because I wanted to see what was below, but I believed he hated me, even then.  I developed the capacity for swimming long distances under water.  I became a furtive creature growing up, learning to hide, to sneak, to not be found.

They signed me over the state eventually, and demonstrated a previously-unknown talent for designing ambushes.  I have nightmares of men I killed, in places I won't mention here.  

But I have suffered from nightmares since my earliest days.  I recently spoke with my biological sister, whatever.

In grade school, praying to be taken away.  I also prayed for my parents to die.  I realize now that they also had terrible lives growing up, and only did what they knew.  It is in that compassion empathy that I forgive them, even as I acknowledge that I am a broken product of their marriage.

I was possessed for decades by a single desire for a close relationship with one person, screaming in what must have been a shrill little boy's voice, that I would never have children, for I would never allow the possibility of what he had done to me happening to them.  Time has witnessed my regretful oathkeeping.  No woman, no children, not even a friend to call on.

I have had too many people try to kill me, under a host of different organizations and hats I have worn.  So many times when I fought to stay alive, to my very utmost ability, things happening faster that I could keep track, believing I would die anyone and no one would know or care that I passed, but I fought for the grail that someone was going love me one day, goddammit(!).  Even now, because of the bitter pain and deep feelings of betrayal that I never had anyone who cared.  I did my best to keep people alive, hate them for their selfishness

I have fallen passionately for several women over the course of my lifetime, and they left.

For all my injuries, or take the bus, etc., when I'm released.  I have to have someone with me for 24 hours after I'm released in case of infection.  And I have no one.  In all the agencies I have served, my psych profiles all said that I was close to very few people, unwilling or unable to trust, which was made me so ideal for extended solo operations.  I'm not angry.  I had amazing adventures.  I am sad

And I am ashamed, but at the end of the day, when I lean over and cry out just a little in pain, and try to find a posture that doesn't hurt, it comes back to me: I feel dead already, most of the time.  And everyone dies alone.

Thanks to all who made it this far


EDIT and UPDATE (see below): I am deeply sorry I did not reply sooner.  This was a throwaway, not to seek help.  I didn't keep my password handy.  I just typed, did a lousy job with typing (typos, grammar, etc.) and threw the password away, because I didn't intend to come back to read the comments.  But I am curious to the point of self-destructiveness.  Then I had to find the password again, and ended doing a reset because I didn't bother to write it down.  I was really upset.  I thought the last time I went through this it wouldn't happen again, I'm still in the same place.

I just wanted to dump this where no one knows me, people didn't visit.  I couldn't have friends over, and later, I didn't want them to know where I lived.  We lived in squalor, surrounded by middle-class families.  Our house was a mess I rarely saw in my years in law enforcement in a huge metropolitan area.  Think of something along the lines of ""Hoarders"" set in some remote village.  Dirt floor in part of the house.  Wood floor *with* dirt on the rest.  Wallpaper ripped from the walls, naked plaster underneath.  My brother and I pissed our beds for years.  I didn't know until I was in Abnormal Psych in uni that it's considered a sign of abused children, which we were.  In my military life and later in government service, NDAs

For those of you calling this fake

After a particularly horrible experience when I was around 10, or escape.  After that, I started self-harming.  It was my way of seeking control, I think.  I put coals on my skin, I cut myself in places no one would look.  I trained myself for being tortured, because I was.  As a kid.  Later, again, my ears ringing

**UPDATE**: A woman I work with has a serious medical issue which is scheduled to be dealt with around the same time as mine.  I will be her caretaker, your children, your dogs and lolcats.  I am reluctant to say more.

I originally found this girl completely at random on Tumblr. Pretty much just clicking through posts and source links until I stumbled upon a picture. Her picture. Oh my god

I browsed through her Tumblr feed and found all of her other social media profiles through her posts. All of them public... Twitter, Pinterest. She definitely wasn't shy about what she posted. Lots of nudes and other sexy photos, along with just random day to day photos. This girl is breathtaking.

Finally

Holy shit, but I started digging in deeper. I just had to. 

Over the next few months

I figured out where she lived, what she was studying, what campus she was in, what building. I even started to figure out her schedule. I figured who her closest friends were, their names and where they lived (she geotaged photos taken at their houses). I figured out where her parents lived, her sister and her boyfriend. She took so many photos of the inside of her house, I could almost draw up the blueprints. I knew where she hung out and the places she frequented. I knew what car she drove and where she filled up for gas.

To pinpoint some of the locations, and I'm certain nobody else does.

With all the little fragments that she scattered across online

Until one day, the trees. I'm here. It's not just a game anymore. When the light turned green, I decided to go. I went for it. I drove around the neighbourhood until I got to her street.

There it was. I'm driving down and right ahead is her house. Her car. Her.

Everything I pieced together was real, they're the ones she posted a picture of months ago.

**What the fuck am I doing.**

I hit the gas, it's someone's life.


I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. It's been over a month since I drove past her house and I haven't even thought about continuing my stalking since. But I just needed to tell this story for some reason. It was a strange feeling

Background: Me and my ex had been together for about 1 year- long distance relationship (he lived about 3 hours away). I find out from his sister that he was talking to other women when we were still together and confrontations with him lead nowhere with him saying that I am the only one on his mind and that he would never do that to me (the usual spiel) and that his sister does not know what she is talking about.  I take his side (because i loved him). 

3 weeks ago, that I neglect him (which I don't, I am the one that drives to see him every other weekend when I have the funds, we call, text, skype each other daily) and that I don't want him to live with me (which is true because I don't want to take care of a grown ass man and pay his bills).  He says he loves me and wants to make it work and drops all contact the next day.

I was heartbroken

2 weeks ago, focused on her profile.  I read through months of disgusting selfies of her in a dirty dark bathroom with barely there clothes that even a floozy would be embarrassed of being caught in.  Then I did it.  I made a fake facebook profile of a fine-ass looking man from google that ""used to go to her school."" I befriended all of her friends, made fake posts and befriended her.  All of this took less than a day. You would be surprised at how many people would befriend you on facebook just from your looks regardless of they know you or not.  I had about 140 ""friends"" in just 2 hours and at that point, people were requesting to be my friend every few minutes.  I dunno who is more pathetic, me or these weirdos (just me probably). I started to chat her up the next day, she was very ""open"" with herself, even sending me new pictures of herself in little clothing to a complete stranger without any in return.  Being a woman myself, she was complaining about my ex to me already.  I told her I wanted to meet up and will pick her up and ""show her what its like to be with a real man.""  At this point, what have you.  It was time.

While all this was going on, he says yes (twice) and they were not obviously.  This should have broken my heart but it didnt.   I knew the truth but told him that yes i love him and that I want him to move in with me.  He sounded happy, excited- whatever and said that he was going to give his 2 weeks to his boss that day.  He texted me later and told me that he just left them with no notice instead because, ""fuck em.""  He was going to start packing and will head out with everything later in the week.

The Revenge.  I posted all of the conversations up on fake facebook, I had 53 likes and 82 messages.  Her family, friends all saw it.  My ex saw it and almost immediately texted me to say how he misses me, he can't wait to be with me and doesn't mention anything about the girl.  

Friday rolls around and he tells me he is on his way to my apt.  He does not know where I live because I recently moved.  I tell him to meet me at a CVS close by so I direct him on where to go.  He tells me he is almost out of gas and that I will have to help him put some in it.  I agree and tell him that I will once he gets there.  I get a text telling me he's at the CVS and asks where I am.  I ignore it.  30 minutes later, drove to another CVS thinking I was there but now he has no gas and is stranded at a gas station with his things in the car.  Calls ignored.  I take an ambien and go to bed.

Saturday morning. I have 37 text messages 28 missed calls and 7 voicemails from him and that he had to call his mom to come pick him up.   Since then, cheating loser of a brother.

Update: just got back from the hospital. This was not my fault. I talked to a counselor and she made me see that people manipulate circumstances to take advantage of their victim and then the victim feels like it was their fault. I was incapacitated and taken advantage of and dumped and it is not ok. I learned a lot today. Care for victims is free but had to travel to another part of town to get the exam.

I have up to two years to press charges. I'm going to go to the police department tomorrow.

The gods of fate were cruel though and I could find nothing but a face cloth, and people in the bathroom queue were growing impatient.

1359484909.0,17ic9l,I pimped out high school girls for two years. One of them was my sister. AMA.,Rockedout,547,151,105,"Of all the bad things I did back in my drug-using, partying

She wasn't the only one or the one I most regret. Like I said Mary was a screwed up girl before I met her. I'm not saying I didn't make things worse for her but I'm positive what ended up happening to her wasn't entirely my fault. The ones I regret most aren't even the friends she helped me recruit from her school after Mary became a proper prostitute. Most of them were also sort of crazy already or else Mary wouldn't have been able to convince them to work for me.

The one I regret most is my sister. She was fifteen the first time she asked me for drugs. Just marijuana which I had plenty of but I convinced her it cost ten times what it did. Keep in mind I was on something practically all the time at this point and had grown used to seeing young women as a means to make cash. I was absolutely without remorse or guilt. So she paid with saved up allowence money

It wasn't long before she became my constant companion at parties, including Mary, would go out and get high and then I'd hook them up with someone. I would take the majority of the money and they never complained because they were scared of me for a couple reasons. They were scared I might hurt them because yes, I barely remember doing so but while coked out I was known for getting violent. They were also scared whenever I threatened to leave them or cut them off. They saw me do that to a few of their friends and they didn't want that to happen.

This went on for two years. It ended after my sister was arrested for possession and solicitation. I'd had the bright idea that my girls should be getting their own Johns so I started bringing them to clubs where I knew the bouncers and send them in to find customers for their services. It worked well for a few short weeks until my sister got caught up in a police raid. They arrested dozens of people that night

After that only Mary remained of my girls. The rest were scared now and my sister was in a drug treatment center. I tried getting some of them back, I was the loser druggie guy.

What finally got me to change was the day I brought Mary over to one of my dealer's friend's place. This friend was supposedly really into young red heads and would pay $300 for some fun with her. My dealer vouched for him but I brought Mary there myself anyway because I wanted the money. I was back to being broke and I needed cash desperately. So I brought her to this sketchy neighborhood and walked her to the door. Funny thing is

When we entered the room I knew something was off. There were three guys there and they had flashlights. They said something about the power being off and I stupidly believed them enough to let them lead me into the main room. Mary was freaking out at this point, total mess, all fucked up. Before all that registered to me I was attacked.

They beat the shit out of me. I barely remember any of it. I do remember being strapped into a gurney and hearing a paramedic say that my lung was punctured. Turns out he was wrong but I was in enough pain to believe it. I spent the next few days in the hospital being treated for a variety of things including a concussion that required them drilling a hole in my skull, and of course heroin withdrawl. 

When the police spoke with me I refused to answer any questions until they asked me if I knew that my friend Mary had been assaulted as well. I remember feeling, all swollen and bruised, made me cry like a girl.

I told the police everything about my dealer friend and how he'd set up the date with mary that night. But nothing ever came of it. The dealer kept his mouth shut and even though they raided his home they only found a little pot. No money

Yeah, is still a heavy user. My sister got clean and is now in college but she's had a string of abusive boyfriends and I know that's probably my fault.

EDIT2: For those that mention that I shouldn't condemn her for having a new boyfriend: I don't, only 2 years after getting married. I only found out recently about this. I had been buying her tickets for her to go see him for the past months unknowingly, because she said they were to go to exhibitions with her sports team... Not to mention the amount of clothes, makeup and phone bills I had to pay. We took a flight together to see her family and spend 2 weeks with them in the middle of that affair for god's sake. That's the reason why this separation has been so painful, I felt horribly betrayed by my wife, this once wonderful, beautiful angel.

At the time he was engaged to the woman who is now his wife

Flash forward years to about ~1.5 years ago and I'm living with my then girlfriend of 3 years. One day while we're together at home, in one of the tabs.

In it, but the emails were over the span of a couple months and who knows if she ever deleted mail.

Now I had been cheated on a few times before by other girls but this time really struck a chord with me. This is the guy that I'd expect to have my back, so I forwarded copies of the emails to my own address and cleaned up the evidence of what I did to decide what to do later, then turned off my girlfriend's laptop. When she got home about two hours later she noticed it was off and I just told her that she left it on and I didn't know when she was coming back so I turned it off. I can only guess where she went for those hours. Probably to get bent over by Mark I thought.

Before I found out I really had no reason to suspect it

After several hours of thinking I thought up a plan: I was going to fuck his wife or at least try to, though. I had never cheated on a girl before and never tried to get with any woman I knew was in a relationship, but now I had wanted to get revenge and had a new sort of morbid curiosity and desire to know what it's like to be on the other side of things after being cheated on several times.

Within the next two weeks on a day off I went to Mark's house the pretense of returning something borrowed on a day I'd knew he'd be at work, but then started some small talk about how she'd been lately and asked if I could use the bathroom. 20 seconds and one flush later I'm inside their house with her, continuing the smalltalk. She offered me a drink if I was thirsty so we went to the kitchen.

After I finished my drink I made it a bit personal and started asking how things were going between her and Mark these days. She seemed to think everything was great. I sort of it threw it out there that Mark seemed a bit off lately (though I hadn't actually noticed anything out of the ordinary before the email) and shrugged, showing her my girlfriend's naked pictures she sent as well.

She seemed floored and started sobbing, I'd hang out with her and we'd do it regularly. Not too long later, like a month or so later we were going without protection. She was showing pregnant months later and I still kept seeing her. We didn't really discuss it much and I just kind of went with the flow.

I kept pretending everything was normal between Mark and I and my girlfriend and I even though I still wondered why he would do something like that

His wife gave birth earlier this year. The baby looks like has more of my features than his so it might be mine but who knows really with how babies look. No one can tell because babies don't really look like anyone. I'm still seeing her. She probably doesn't want to leave him because he makes a lot more than I do

To be honest, they aren't my real friends, they're all superficial as fuck and I know they'd want to go to expensive places if they ever knew what I could afford.

I'm able to keep this such a good secret because I work a stable job and it looks like I can afford all the things I buy, and same thing with my condo. Since I grew up with nothing I still act like I have nothing. Yes, I can afford a luxorious lifestyle but that was never me.

On this, a successful career, a beautiful wife who I love more than anything. At the same time I cringe during this time of year when I think back to the life I used to lead. All the names and locations in this confession have been fabricated but, with a nod to old memories not being one hundred percent reliable, what I shall confess here is true.

Also before I begin let me state that I am not proud of this period of my life. I'm absolutely ashamed about it.

***

Out of high school I went to work at a manufacturing plant that my father and his before him had both worked at their entire lives. I made pretty decent money and owned my first house when I was only 19 while most of my friends were working shitty jobs and living in small

Enter James

One day James asked me if I'd like to make $400 cash. Who wouldn't? And all I had to do was drive a car of his from the city nearby to a city about four hours away. That was it. He'd even give me an extra $50 to buy a bus ticket home after. So I did it without many questions.

That's how it began. Every few weeks he'd ask me if I'd be willing to do it again. And though I knew something shady must be going on I figured what the hell? All I had to do was drive, no questions asked.

One day during one of the drives the car

I never mentioned the flat or my discovery of the guns to James. The money was too good and I didn't want to piss him off. But over time we just eventualy

About a year later I knew full well that I was transporting either guns or drugs (usually heroin or pot)

Meanwhile, with girls who were hot as fuck. I had serious girlfriends during this time, too, but whenever I had some kind of beef with James he'd show up at more door with some young hottie that barely spoke English. Some, I suspect, were no older than sixteen. But they were always very submissive and compliant and they always showed me a good time.

I knew in the back of my head that these girls were being mistreated. That they were prostitutes. That they were basically sex slaves. But I ignored all my reservations. I liked fucking them. And I treated them like shit because it made me feel good somehow.

Eventually James asked me to drive three girls to the other city and drop them off at a bar. They were ""transferring"" he told me. I agreed. During that drive one of them tried to escape during a stop at a rest area. She literally threw open the door and took off running as soon as I stopped the car. I chased her down

After that I still didn't stop. I ran the girls, from my city to the other and back. I still ran the drugs and guns, too, and I made a lot of money in the process.

Everything began to finally change for me when James had me help him start recruiting locals. I know it's horrible but the foreign girls were easy to ignore since I never really understood them. Only one in three ever knew much English and even then they were usually quiet. But local girls? They weighed on my conscience. I suddenly saw them as human. One in particular begged me to bring her home and she was as young as my little sister. So I did. I brought her home. 

The scariest moment of my life was when James showed up at my house after that. He was furious and he was carrying as always. He actually drew his piece on me. I don't know how but somehow I talked him down from murdering me right then and there.

I did a few more runs for him after that but no women/girls. Eventualy I got lucky: the plant I worked at had ordered increased production. Seven day work weeks. James knew he couldn't pay me enough to make up for me quitting that job so he accepted the fact I know longer could be one of his runners. After a few months he stopped even asking me.

I got my shit together during that time. I became very religious as the guilt for what I had done consumed me. I remain religious to this day though not so much as back then.

Eventually I ended up becoming one of the ""suckers"" I used to sneer at. I went back to school. I got a degree and have been working in my field of study ever since. No idea why I got so lucky. Had I been pulled over once in any of those drives I would have been fucked.

Those days will forever haunt my nightmares. When I think of those poor girls, whenever I read about a shooting in that city I brought so many guns to I wonder if possibly one of the weapons had been delivered there by me. The drug overdoses, too, the lives ruined by the drugs. Jesus help me.

I noticed the obvious stares, hell I liked the attention. It was flattering that a powerful, successful man would be attracted to a slightly awkward, silly girl straight out of college. When you spend 10 hours a day working with the same person, and you chat to him about everything, and you work so hard you don't have time for a proper social life, your defences start to crack.

It was just once. One crazy night after a week of the hardest work both of us have ever had to do on a particularly complex set of contracts. He bought expensive champagne and we sat on the couch in his office and drank it until we got giddy. Then he kissed me

""Let's not read too much in to this"" he said. ""I love my wife"".

A few weeks later I missed my period, uncertain about what to do.

I went in screaming but he was surprisingly cool about it. We've come to an arrangement. I'm keeping it. He's paying me $1000 per month to help out as long as I never say a word to anyone about whose kid it is. As far as anyone's concerned

My parents aren't pleased. My sister is more understanding although she can't understand why her sister-who-tells-her-everything won't say a word about who her babydaddy is. 

The world keeps on turning. In 3 months I'll have new priorities (my due date is July). And I'm pretty sure I'll get all the maternity time I'll need

I ended up telling my brother that what happened between us, as my brother, and had admitted that he was physically attractive, but that I had no interest in ever being with him romantically. I think it really hurt him, and our bond has never been the same. It's awkward when we hang out alone or with friends.

I haven't told anyone but my mom, I feel disgusting and dirty. I wonder how I will ever marry someone if I have to hide such a gross experience from them, and I would never want to share this story with anyone, because I am afraid they would secretly judge me and never love me.

No label ever signed us and looking back I cringe at the shitty music we produced.

That didn't stop me from being sort of a local celebrity. In a small pond even a tiny fish can be a whale and my town was small enough to qualify. I was written about several times in local newspapers and practically everybody thought I was going to be the next Billy Joe Armstrong or Trent Reznor.

Especially girls. Especially young girls. Most of our fans were teenage girls who were easily manipulated into thinking we were superstars. Me and the guys thought we deserved the adoration and had no qualms about cashing in whenever possible. We thought it was funny how easy these girls were to take advantage of and we used them maliciously as a result. All these years later

Eventually a couple members of the band realized that we weren't going anywhere and they quit. I refused to accept the fact we weren't going to make it because at the time I felt like I had no other options in life.

Turns out the engine threw a rod. I called a buddy of mine from a nearby payphone and he came straight away to give it a look. He just shook his head and told me the brutal truth: the car was fucked.

That very same night I was at a bar

Derrick took that joke seriously. He told me that if I needed money for a new car I could use Michelle to get it. 

That's how it all started. With Derrick's help I managed to convince Michelle to prostitute herself to help me fund my band. Derrick introduced her to heroin (something I never got into) and before long she was practically living with him. And working for him. I got 50% of every job she completed so I wasn't complaining. 

It didn't stop there. I started calling and recruiting full time. Derrick taught me how to do it and I was an eager student. I'd say that all told I successfully got twenty young women to work for us

I just wanted to say we're truly sorry for not being able to accomodate you within our group. I know you wanted to experience the Walking Dead maze, lol. We don't want you to think we just said that so you would leave us alone (you're not a creeper, so you don't have to apologize for asking!), and as soon as you left we felt our hearts sink because we should've invited you in our group anyways. Nobody should be alone on Halloween night at the Haunt, and we all thought that it was really unfortunate that your friends had to leave early for whatever reason.

It struck me in particular because I felt a connection with you-- I used to be the guy that wanted to stay until the very end but my other friends always had other obligations. I was always left behind. I was the guy who wanted to ride that attraction that's best experienced in a group who unfortunately didn't have a group and I didn't want to society to look at me like I'm a loser who rides on all the rides alone. So I'd just go home.

Unlike you, ""Today, you. Tomorrow, me."" I screwed that shit up. And if I could turn back time and say, ""Yeah bro, you can join us, no problem

Of course, but I'll say, the look of courage I saw in your eyes when you asked us as we cold-heartedly turned you down gave me the impression that I was a douche bag when I saw the defeat in your stare right after. We should've left YOU with the decision whether you wanted to join us wherever we went rather than shutting you out completely, because we're human beings like that.

Regardless, but I saw you running after looking at your phone, so I assume it was to the maze queue. If you didn't make it or decided not to go, I'm sorry :/.

So, ""her and Ted are getting divorced"".  This came as a complete shock to the family as everyone thought their marriage was pretty solid.  She had just gotten back from a trip to Florida with ""the girls"" (a bunch of rich, divorced, middle-aged type bitches).  We (the family) all figured that they'd gotten to her head with all the ""You're better off without him, gurlfriend!"" shit that is typical with them.  

A few weeks later, but what catches my eye is the guy signing off with ""XOXO"" and I'm thinking that's pretty fucking weird for a professional email.

I was in first year premed and doing fairly well. I had a bio prof that I found extremely attractive even though she was 55 to my 22. On st. Patrick's day we were in the lab doing some cell culturing and as anyone who has  done this knows there are some substantial wait times involved. (This was a 5 hour lab).

We started a cell culture and finished up with our notes but didnt have to be back in the lab for about 2.5 hours to do the rest of the lab so my lab partner and I decided to go to the campus bar. Well I drank two pitchers of green beer and headed back to the lab. 

I walked in a little tipsy (I'm 6'5"" and 240lbs) and I see the prof reading a book over her lab table. I walked up to her and started flirting. My lab partner tried to pull me away...I guess worried she would be upset we were drinking or something. She starts flirting back so I ask her if after the lab she wants to come back to the campus bar with us and have some drinks. She says she cant be seen in the campus bar with us but offers to take me to some other bar near by. 

We went to the bar and she bought us a few drinks and then we cabbed back to her place. Had sex. Woke up the next morning to people eating breakfast. Her family decided to come over to visit I guess. Went into the dining room and sat down. People were extremely confused about who the hell I was until she walked into the room and kissed me...everyone looked really awkward

But the actual story is quite a bit longer.

I did a tour in the US Army

Fast forward past two years of drinking and being seriously depressed.

Im out of money, alternate lifestylers etc. Make friends with a bunch of them. There is this one chic there, that just hates my guts. Cant stand me. Says im to polite, that im to nice. Always says some nasty shit to me, etc.

Few months pass, still seriously depressed, still drinking, but generaly coming out of the nose dive. Get a job, get place, doing pretty well. Start being friends with the mean chick. Find out shes rather cool. Older than me a bit, previously married, and i like him.

Start sleeping with her. Not cause i really felt anything

Couple months pass, no money, no place...no where to go. Chick asks me to move in. I do, figure since i fuck her, i could sleep over, right?

Not a bad deal realy. Have some money from disability from the army

Month later, after long conversation, she confesses shes in love with me. I have no idea what to say..so i just say i love her to.

Fast forward 3 years. 

Things have been shitty financially, lots of stress, lots of fighting. My now wife is starting to get seriously bitchy, saying some realy nasty shit. I dont like arguing, but its getting to the point where i feel like shes actually goading me into hitting her. I finaly have enough, and make plans to leave her. Find out shes pregnant. My heart sinks. Do the right thing and stay with her.

Things get better for a while, have a beautiful baby boy, i even take some classes at the local college. Come to love her son as my own flesh and blood. Am actually doing pretty well emotionally. Stressed a bit, not really happy, but generally ok.

The recession hits. My business tanks. Shes a nurse, but i didnt figure it out till later). We lose the house, one of the cars, and have no where to g0. Family takes us in, and we move to Texas.

Texas. Living in a converted garage, had no choice) Working for relatives. Every time i turn around, wife has spent the check on something we dont need. Some decorations, furniture we dont have room for. Watches, jewelry. Etc.

I finaly get contacted by some crediters..find out i have a ton of debt. 56k of debt. Find out the wife had opened up credit cards in my name, bank accounts, etc. Also found out she had been stealing my business money when it was running.

So..heres the picture.

We are living in a one bedroom+den apartment. Barely making it week to week. Im out of a job (random contracts with my families business, seriously depressed, seriously unhappy, and start thinking about ending it all. We dont really go out, and honestly, i haven't done anything fun, other than run to the store or a late night beer run for a couple years.

Ive played MMOs pretty much constantly, so i try it out. Get into the RP scene, and start having some serious fun. Other than my children, pretty much the only thing i had to go on.

While in game, having similar marriage issues as i. We have alot of common interests, and realy seem to get along. We end up talking for 3-4 hours a time, longer on weekends. I start having some feelings for this person. And seriously not knowing how to deal with it.

Like those fluttery bouncy feelings. And seriously, i thought i was having small heart attacks, or something.

Emotionally, and generally am more up beat. I start wanting to go out, to go to bars, or play pool or something.

Wife notices

Week or so later, im gonna rip some ones head off, i could use a vacations. Sure. (Note: I had no idea on what feelings i had for this girl, im not exactly what you would call emotionally self aware.)

So, talk about shit..and get into nature right? Walk in the woods. And i feel seriously at peace. All my pressers, and shit just slide off. Happy as could be.

Night comes, we get tired, and there is futon. We both kind of lay down, and cuddle up. One thing lead to another, and im balls deep. And not caring a damn.

The weekend is god damn awesome. Never felt like that with anyone. Everything is absolutely perfect. I dont even feel any guilt about cheating. Time comes

Apparently i was out of service range for my cell, find out shes sent my stuff over to my moms, and is kicking me out.

Im like....*shrug* Meh

Next two weeks are crazy. Couch surfing at my moms. Doint say anything about my weekend, and tells me she fucked a guy. Im not even sure i care. 

Huge fight, to bad. I was going to be happy with her or without her.

She goes out with two separate other dudes

I decide to move 400 miles a way and give it a shot with this other woman.

Takes me a month of doing shitty jobs to save enough money, which is tiny) Never knew they even existed before this.

The woman ends up leaving her husband for me
Happiest fucking time of my life. Never felt this kind of stuff before. Compared to any other time in my life

Rough divorce for both her and me. Her parents loath me

Fast forward three years.

Im remarried, two cars, and have never been more happy in my life.

Finally one night, not because I was losing him but because I was now no longer engaged. I had to take off my diamond. I had to re-join the ranks of the single girls. I begged and pleaded, not because I loved him, but because I loved the idea of being a married woman. My friends and family to this day think he’s the biggest ass hole in the world because as far as they knew, we were a ridiculously happy couple moving toward marriage one day, and he was callously calling it off the next.

I still wanted him

It was such a strange thought that I just left it alone in my head for a while, I liked it more and more. There wasn't a second that I didn't realize it was crazy. I knew logically it wouldn't work, and logically he'd only end up hating me if I actually did it, but how he felt was somehow completely second to having him. I decided that I'd buy him prostitutes if he wanted, I'd buy him whatever he wanted, keep up to date on his comics and shows and make sure he never missed any of them.

When I moved, because that one was attached to the bathroom and when I captured him, he'd need free access to that. I started researching what would be needed, how to knock someone unconscious without unnecessary medical problems. 

I didn't tell anyone where I was moving

My tentative plan was to invite him over, drive his car back to his home, and walk back to mine. We hadn't spoken in months at that point, so I was pretty sure a random past coworker wouldn't be on anyone's list of suspects, especially since we had never really advertised our relationship or break up.

I stopped when I realized it would be impossible to tell if he was allergic to the drug I wanted to use.

I have no idea why that stopped me cold, I dropped the entire idea. I deleted him from my phone. I moved on. I've had healthy relationships before this, and continued to do so afterward.

My father was a heroin addicted

My mother was the only one who worked and I stayed with him and my grandmother most of the time as we bounced between my paternal and maternal grandmothers homes. My father never hit me or abused me in a direct sense but by the age of five he had taught me how to tie off his arm so he could ""take his medicine"". His mother had given him money to buy my mother a wedding ring

He beat my mother so bad she has a scar on her lip so bad she can't even wear lipstick and even knocked a tooth out. When I was seven she left him for good. His own mother had to move 3k miles away so he couldn't steal from her anymore and during that time he got HIV. For the next decade he would call from a social workers phone or with a calling card his mother would send him to talk to me and my sister. My sister didnt even really remember him and the calls were like talking to an acquaintance we didn't like but were polite to. 

When I was 19 I had my daughter. He begged to be allowed to see his first grandchild and living 2 hours away I was sure he would never come up with the bus fare or the money for a hotel so I agreed. To my horrible surprise he did. His first night he came to our apartment and I made dinner. Without me knowing he slipped into the bathroom and shot up. He came out and picked up my newborn baby girl and held her in his lap. As I washed dishes I glanced over to see him nodding out and my baby slowly beginning to roll off his lap onto the floor. I literally dove and caught her. I threw him out. 

Now he had saved enough money to come up but not any to get back to the shelter where he was living. I had told him in passing where I was working and he started living in the woods across from the office building. Every morning he would run out in front of my car asking me to go buy him coffee, etc. He started coming INTO THE OFFICE looking for me. I was mortified! He was homeless, looked and smelled like shit and would loudly announce ""I'm looking for my daughter!"". The upfront staff thought he was just a crazy guy but finally I had to confess the situation to my boss, I broke down in years in front of her. 

My mother and I went to the police but were told the land he was ""camping"" on was public so they couldn't arrest him for trespassing and unless he put his hands on me they couldn't arrest him for harassment. The law was no help.

So my mother and I did the only thing we could think of. On my day off we drove to my job, etc. I lost my shit. LOST IT. I spewed a lot of things but the only one I truly recall word for word was ""This family is saying 'fuck off' the way you said 'fuck off' every time you stuck that fucking needle in your arm! I'm your first born child and I'm telling you to do me a favor and fucking kill yourself!"".  I'll never forget the look on his face. Shock and even anger.

A week later we got a call from the police. He had killed himself with a lethal overdose of heroin. Now some may think it could have been an accident. My father was a professional drug addict for over 25 years and never had an OD

I was thrilled. To this day I LOVE the fact that the bastard took himself out only when I told him too. Had I known I would of told him to when I was a child. I don't regret it,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,t3_13d8cz

She wanted me to teach her and said she would do it with this fucked up kid who did drugs instead of me if I didn't. It was actually very mild.

Well the law got involved, are now enemies. It is true we did stuff underage, but nobody cared about the nuances of it, that I was the only one who was there for her, the one who gave her guidance, that she listened to, the only one who was a positive influence

Now for what I did

Even all these years later, moms shielding their kids and pulling them into the grass when I'm anywhere near and accusations of being a pedophile. 

Last summer a group of teenagers kidnapped me, and the police refused to come and get me. I get threats of violence, and police told me maybe I shouldn't have been a rapist. I am tired of not having the most basic human rights because of the sex offender hysteria. 

I am unable to have a relationship with anyone because they dump me as soon as they find out. 

I still talk to the girl everyday. It is almost 10 years later

I know we belong together. I still love her

You see

After being harassed so much, beat me, and threaten to kill me. When the teenagers kidnapped me, I was terrified, they were talking about lighting me on fire, and I thought that was the end. 

The girl wants to be with me, let alone were in an online relationship.  

I wish I had the strength to leave this town, I could not face her family without feeling like scum. I could not bring our families together in marriage as they are now mortal enemies. And she could not tell her family either, as they would cut her off quickly.

I think the world would be a better place if people realized that everyone has their own fair share of troubles. Everyone has hardships

A few months ago, the bus got too crowded and the while person in front of her managed to get on, she didn't. She flashed the worst bitch-face I've ever seen (seriously unforgettable) and I secretly laughed at her misery. Hah! Serves her right for cutting my queue! My friend and I started discussing her behavior, very loudly so she could hear it - ""B*tch cut my queue, and STILL couldn't get on the bus, what an idiot!"" We were bitching non-stop about her, judging her appearance from head to toe, she turned to me, but till today I still feel bad about treating someone who was in distress so badly.

I didn't even realize I had accidentally cut the queue of a whole bunch of people who were fuming mad at me. One lady gave me a earful, telling me to watch it, didn't give a shit about the queue.

My parents are pretty much the stereotypical immigrant Asian parents. They're controlling, and strict. I am grateful for them taking care of me all these years, but I can't stand being around them. And let me start out by saying that I don't consider myself a spoiled brat. I go to a top university, have a 9-5 job in a big company, and I didn't even get a cell phone until I went off to college. 

My parents are always criticizing everything I do 24/7. Anything I do that isn't reading or studying is a waste of time for them

My dad is extremely arrogant and treats me like I'm a 5 year old. But at least he's somewhat reasonable and stable. What has really been driving me insane though is the fact that my mom is emotionally unstable. She's extremely manipulative, she takes her anger out on others. Sometimes, I'm just sitting there minding my own business when my mom just randomly chews me out for being a useless slob who can't do shit. She will find anything to yell at me for when she's not in a good mood. Just today, she saw a single sock that I dropped on the floor of my room and started screaming at me about how I'm such a filthy person who can't keep my shit together. Basically, whenever she's mad, she will throw a fucking tantrum and use others as emotional punching bags. In her twisted mind, she is above everyone else. There's no possible way for her to ever be wrong because she has no flaws. Plus she is always threatening to drop me out of college and disown me. 

Even worse, she yells at me for ""wasting"" it when I can use it again (which is fucking gross). I get yelled at for working out or exercising because it costs money to wash clothes and take showers. She says shit like this on a daily basis, and it drives me insane. 

I almost never talk to my parents about anything. They know nothing about my personal life at all. They often say I'm being a bad son for not talking to them

Unfortunately, and basically all of its customs. I hate how Asian kids are instilled with a belief that their parents are perfect people who are never wrong. I hate how anything outside of studying and reading is looked down upon as a waste of time. I hate how Asian parents pretty much see themselves as shareholders and their kids as stocks, and the kids are expected to do nothing but be be high value investments for the parents. I hate how Asian parents are always putting their kids down and comparing them to others. I hate how being quiet, submissive, and beta is encouraged in Asian culture. I hate all this ""Tiger Parent"" and ""Confucious say"" horse shit. 

I know it's not rational to hate an entire culture because of my parents, I say no, I'm American.

1335341456.0,srhd4,When I was 14 I prostituted myself out to one of my best friend's dad on a regular basis.,ella1993,382,74,174,"I've been debating for a long time whether or not I should share this here and finally decided to after a chat I just had with the friend ""Roger"". I was so close to telling him about what I did with his dad all those years ago but decided not to b/c he thinks of his father

So basically I went through a phase when I was 14 where I was being the typical rebellious teenage girl and my big act of rebellion was basically being a huge slut. I was having sex already and put on this ""I can do whatever I want"" attitude. Keep in mind my mom had been calling me names like slut and whore since I was as young as ten. I think part of me thought like I would be getting back at her somehow by actually behaving that way you know? So while most girls my age thought third base was a big deal I acted like sex was no big thing. Oh

So yeah most of my best friends were guys and one day I was riding my bike back from another friend's house when my front wheel blew. I had a cell phone but my mom had taken it away as punishment for skipping class or something. Well I happened to be near Roger's house so I stopped there to see if I could use his phone to call my dad and ask for a ride home.

Mr. Jones was the only person home and when I explained the situation he said he'd gladly give me a ride home himself if I was willing to wait a few minutes. I was really relieved b/c I didn't want to walk the bike home and I knew my dad would be annoyed if he had to come get me. So I waited in his living room while he did something upstairs.

I had known Roger and therefore his dad for a long time so I was really comfortable being alone in a house with him. When he called down for me to come upstairs so he could show me something I thought it was a little weird but didn't think much of it I just went. When I got to his bedroom I found him sitting on his bed wearing nothing but a bathrobe which was hanging open enough so that I could see his penis which was erect.

I remember just standing there in shock as he smiled and went into full creeper mode. He told me I was very beautiful and he wanted to have a serious talk with me and asked me to come have a sit next to him on the bed. I know I should have taken off but I didn't. I kind of thought ""Of course he wants me it's no big deal"" and got into my rebellious frame of mind at the thought of having sex with one of my best friend's dad.

So I sat next to him and he told me how Roger had told him that the reason I hadn't been able to join them to a baseball game a few weeks earlier was b/c I didn't have the money. He also said that he knew I wasn't a virgin and a girl like me had no reason to be broke. He started touching me as he droned on and on about how there were ways for attractive girls to make money and he would ""take care"" of me if I ""took care"" of him.

And I agreed with everything he said and actually got turned on by the idea. So we did it, definitely the best sex I'd ever had at the time. When we were done he told me to get dressed and while I did he laid out $200 in 20s and 10s on the bed and told me it was mine.

After that we had a system. He would text me a single character when he wanted me to come over. Each character stood for a different situation

And wow did he get me into some kinky stuff too. He paid $200 every time for straight up sex but gave ""bonuses"" for more. Like, another $20 to tie me up and one time he paid me an obscene amount of money to let him piss on me. Yes literally piss on me, my face my hair my breasts everything. 

We had this arrangement for only about three months but I probably saw him twice a week. Made a lot of money during those three months. The whole thing ended sort of out of the blue too. One day he sent a text that meant I should come to his house and when I got there he said we had to stop ""seeing"" each other. He gave me $200 just for coming over but said that would be the last time he ever contacted me and it was.

Even at the time all this was happening I really felt bad b/c I felt like I was somehow betraying Roger but honestly that was part of the thrill. Eventually I had a pregnancy scare with someone else and that snapped me out of being so wreckless and irresponsible and I mostly stopped doing such wild shit like that. But yeah... Mr. Jones is now dead

One last thing I want to say before I hit save-- obviously all the names in this post are fake and I also mixed around some of the timeline just in case. It did happen when I was 14 but things like how long it went on and when Mr. Jones died are purposely vague.

About two nights ago I was talking to the person who knows the most about me. We were discussing some of the more ""shady"" experiences of my life and they said they always held back on their true feelings about these things. They said I should feel guilty and ashamed

I go to a man's house, but I honestly never saw it that way. If anything I felt I was exploiting lonely, bored men who could put their money and time to much better use. The only thing I do feel guilty about is that the majority of them have wives or girlfriends that I know are totally clueless about what their SO is doing. I know that if it weren't for me that these men would just look elsewhere ( a lot of the times I am not even the only girl coming over without their SO's knowledge), so honestly I don't even really feel that guilty about that part.

The only thing I do feel guilty is lying to my family and some of my friends. If I am unemployed and I have a lot of money I just say I did some work ""under the table"" or that I saved because I am not good lair. If anyone asks too many questions I just change the subject. I don't like to lie

Since my friend came clean a lot of the people who know this about me have come clean about how they feel as well and because I feel differently they think there must be something wrong with me. I would prefer to not do this and I know it can't last forever, I think. 

Also, he also loved to worship my feet. All of this just seems fun and interesting to me. I guess I am alone in thinking that. I feel like all of these things ( naked house cleaning included ) have taught me a lot and even cured a lot of my anxiety issues.

Okay

 Last year, gave me horrible stomach cramps, diarrhea, you name it. I had scheduled a doctor's appointment to switch over to a new medication, but at the time, I needed the drug to keep my depression in check. So I kept taking the drug, figuring I'd just have to deal with it in the meantime.

At the time, I woke up realizing, ""Hey, I feel pretty shitty."" However, I'd skipped class four or five times already, and worse yet, today was a ""workshop""-type class (meaning somebody reads a creative writing piece and the rest of the class critiques it)

I was sitting in class, I was sort of used to those. I'd found that if I breathed deeply and focused, I could sort of will away the cramps and move on. They got worse, though. The rest of the class was busy critiquing away some girls terrible story when I felt that sort of jolt you get when you know something inside you wants to be outside you and is about to be outside of you REALLY fucking fast. I squirmed in my seat and weighed my options. There was no way I was going to do something in here. I had to get out.

I think I managed to say something like, the cramp had decided it was exiting out of the upper orifice, and I could feel the bile rising up my throat. I was literally puking as I bolted out of the room, and lo and behold, there was a conveniently placed trash can right outside the door! I puked. Hard. Like stars in my eyes, everything fade to black hard. But the sheer act of vomiting made me lose control of the rest of my body.

And THAT was when the diarrhea came.

I was basically vomiting and shitting at the same time. My jeans were wet, ignoring this really confused-looking guy nearby. I hid in a stall and did more business. I removed my pants and just looked down at them. There was a massive brown stain covering the back, all the way down both legs.

I remember peeking out of the bathroom and asking the guy, he did. And then left. Quickly.

I called my roommate to ask her to possibly bring me a pair of jeans, she didn't answer. There was literally only one thing to do. By then, I had been in there for about 45 minutes, and the smell was terrible. If someone came in, they would know right away that something was very rotten in the state of Denmark. I didn't want to talk to anyone. So, I slid the wet jeans back onto my legs, and wrapped a light jacket around my waist to cover up the majority of the stain (although you could still see it on the legs), and in the middle of winter

It was the longest walk of my life. By that point, into a nearby garbage can. Pretty sure the kids who were staring at me thought I was an alcoholic or something. Anyway, I got back, showered, wrapped my shitty clothes into three layers of scented garbage bags, tossed them, and promptly went to sleep for about 12 hours straight.

What would he do if he found out? He'd be angry but he doesn't believe in divorce for any reason. Ever. So I don't know. Maybe he'll feel differently when it's about him.

Why did I go off birth control? Because when he gets an idea in his head he will not stop about it. Also, I know.

I don't think he intentionally sabotaged the condoms. When he's excited he tends to mess up

Counselling - we went to a church counsellor and he mostly talked about how children are a blessing

Why did I marry him - I love him and  80% of the time he's the most amazing man. He always says how he loves me

What do I want to do? I don't really want to get drunk etc. But always

married too young - I don't know. Most girls in my church/community get married at this age so it seems normal to me.

1365877443.0,1ca3su,I want my brother to die.,brotherconfession,342,46,71,"Ok

My brother has always been a huge asshole and a sadistic fuck. He is a good deal older than me--about seven years. When I was a baby he enjoyed fighting and tormenting my sister (three years older than me)

He would tell me that he was going to murder me in my sleep by slitting my throat. He reminded me constantly that I was going to die. He would laugh maniacally as I freaked out. I remember on several occasions crying and panicking about my fear of death to my parents and grandparents. 

My parents never really disciplined him about these things, stubborn, and proud person I have ever met, so he would constantly push back and fight with my parents and cause trouble both at home and at school. 

From when I was about 7 years old to 10 years old

Now that I'm older (almost 20) I finally get just how violated I was and how inappropriately he behaved towards me. I hate him. I want him to know how much he hurt me. Of course, he would never apologize. 

The long-term effects are things I have to live with every day of my life. The lack of trust is one, I constantly feel torn between telling my family and not telling my family. I am afraid of how they will react. I feel marginalized and disregarded. It has also caused me to build a wall in my friendships because I don't feel comfortable enough to tell them about what happened to me. I have only told 2 very, very close friends.

The biggest problem is how protective my parents are of him. He has dealt with mental health for a few years now and has told my parents that he has had suicidal thoughts. I am terrified that if I say anything about the sexual abuse

I don't want it to be my fault.

I just want him to be gone.

We walked around the party together. My brother called me

The guy came into the room where I was, etc. He was really sweet.

I stood up to go to the bathroom, I guess. I was frozen in shock. He undid his pants, then pulled mine down. That's when I started struggling, but he threw me down on the bed and my head hit the wall. I was dazed. He began to sodomize me. The pain was unbearable. I tried to scream, but he wadded the sheet up and shoved it in my mouth.

He laughed the entire time. Until he finished. He pulled me up and kissed my cheek, and just stared at the wall. Pants around my ankles, ass in the air. 

After that, but I didn't feel. At all. I was numb. About a month after it happened, I got an STD screening and it came back clean. 

I never told anyone. Why? Because I'm a 6'2""

But this New Year's, I could feel the guy's hand across my mouth. I had a panic attack. The first one I've had since it happened. I haven't seen him at all. Not on campus, not at parties.

I contemplated suicide briefly a few months ago, and it's my fault. I should have stopped him.

Ive been bottling this stuff up for a long time. I guess I should start at the beginning. In the summer of 2012 i was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at the age of 21, this high pitched hysterical laughter that I can only compare to that of Mark Hamil's Joker. The following monday I had my colon removed, I did eleven rounds of chemo and over the months I dated three women

After I finished my chemo the first time I went into remission and gained a new lease on life,started working. And then I went to the ER for abdominal pain. They found a lymphnode with cancer in it. Apparently the cancer was a resistant strain of cancer and survived. So now I am on my second session of chemo, tomorrow I do my fourth round. And then they will run tests to see if this chemo has worked at all. I asked my doctor what would happen if it didnt work. She refused to speak on the matter. Ive done my research, if the chemo didnt work they will operate and remove the lymphnode which is behind my liver. And I have become so apathetic towards everything, i stopped going to class, i stopped going to work, all I do is pursue my hobbies in an attempt to drown my fear with distraction. But the fear sits in my gut everyday and everyday is a struggle just to keep my composure. I cant die, I dont want to look like a coward. Bottom-line is that even though I keep calm and put on a brave face,,

It only just came to my mind how much it bothers me that I don't have a normal relationship with my only sibling. My ex boyfriend's sister posted a huge ass letter to his facebook wall for his birthday detailing how much of a great brother he is and how amazing their relationship is. I can't lie to myself- I'm fucking jealous. 

I hate that my sister is disabled. It's not terrible like, and my parents have always been on my case for not being nicer to her. I simply do not have the patience for her. I hate her voice. Everytime she comes in and says hello I instantly become infuriated for no good reason other than the fact she is there. She's my sister but I don't talk to her at all if I can help it. When I was younger (she's seven years older) we played games and shared rooms even, but as I grew older I grew this huge intolerance to her. I feel bad, but I don't feel like I can do anything about it.

I wish she was normal. I just fucking wish I had a normal sister that I could talk to about things. I've basically grown up as an only child because I isolate myself from her as much as I can. If she was normal I'd be able to do all the fucking things that everyone else does with their older siblings. Have secrets from our parents

That's the next part. When my parents die, but I just don't. I can't stand being around them. I feel uncomfortable and uneasy. You'd think that because I grew up with her my whole life that I'd have this great compassion towards disabled people but it's the exact opposite. She frustrates me more than anyone else I know.

Background:  It was this year, I have never intentionally cheated on someone before, I keep everything as honest as possible and do not by any means like to bullshit. I am a friendly person, and I am also not the type of person to sleep around, I am just an average normal teenage girl. 

I had this group of friends I had actally started hanging out with this year. I dont typically have a lot of friends, but never persued anything with. We'll call him 'Joe'. Joe was very interesting, he can be a complete asshole but he can also be really nice and act like he cares about you. I enjoyed hanging out with Joe and everyone else in the group, so i continued to. We would go to their house, to mine, smoke, talk, never anything sexual with those people. Joe was also a good friend of mine because he was almost betfriends with my 'boyfriend'. He also knew I had a lot of emotional issues from being taken advantage of sexually

One day I went with Joe after school to his house, and he said he wanted to cuddle, naturally I wasnt an asshole about it and polietely said ""no, I dont think we should"". He said ""Yes we should, lay down"" And he pulled me down. I dealt with it for a second becasue I also know him to be the type of person to force what he wants in every situation, including sexual. Laying there next to him, he turns his tv on and we begin to talk about the show that he has been watching frequently. He turns it on and tries to cuddle with me. I make him stop becasue he gets a little touchy. 

It was almost like an instintanious strip, but he clearly did. He moved the blanket and grabbed my hand, I asked ""what are you doing?"" and he said ""Come on, touch it, it's so big, isn't it?"" I told him ""Stop I don't want to, I really don't want to"" after he takes me hand he moves it too his penis and makes me touch it for about 2 minutes while making me kiss him, and all he can say is ""You know you like it, well, so I text him and ask him to smoke with me.

So yesterday at like the asscrack of dawn, I drove. 

This part of the story is actually pretty boring, grabbed a fast food lunch, and slept for six hours in a motel room because I was tired as hell. Woke up just before six, which was actually a really dumb thing to do because it put me right into Friday rush hour traffic. 

I texted Nick when I stopped for gas and told him where I was. I was half afraid he regained his senses from the night before and wasn't going to respond. He texted right back though (was still flipping out a little every time the phone vibrated) and told me to text him when he got to town. I told him it was going to be really late

[The texting itself I didn't feel weird about

After many many hours

I've gotta say

Finally I got to his double-wide trailer. You can laugh or make trailer trash jokes, and that will be the first time he sees me after two years. Turning one of his dogs into a road waffle.  

Luckily

I just realized this entire time I've been posting to Reddit about this that I haven't even described him, I've accused him of looking like a scruffy Paul Rudd). He has dark brown hair that he's let grow out since the last time I seen him, down to his collar...except he wasn't wearing a collar. He wasn't wearing anything but a pair of hospital scrubs as pajama pants. And he has dark gray eyes. I've never seen anybody else with eyes like that. He was looking at me completely neutral and leaning up against the post of the front porch as I got out of the car and petted the dogs enough to get them out of my way.  

I walked up to him without getting my bag or anything. I opened my mouth to talk and that's when he walked forward and locked his arms around me, certainly not any of the suave opening lines I'd been planning out for the past thirteen plus hours. Very uncool. 

To Nick's credit, I would have been embarrassed, but right then I wasn't. Finally I drew back from him and he kind of nodded towards the house and told me he would get my bag. 

So I open the screen door and the regular door, but what can I say? I read anything, especially when someone leaves it laying around on the coffee table, the night stands, the floor, or the counter. Don't even get me started on the books, they've become their own form of furniture. It's clean otherwise though

He followed me in with the dogs and my backpack and I was feeling pretty hangfaced at this point

“Go to bed, he really is furious, and the only thing keeping me from catching hell was the fact that I must have just looked so miserable and tired he would have felt like a bastard for laying into me. 

So I go back to the bedroom and he follows me, so once he turns the side lamp off when we're both in bed I can't really see his face. 

**Me:** I'm so sorry.

**Nick:** I can tell. (I can't really read his voice that well either. It's kind of weird and flat and it's worrying me

**Me:** I never wanted to hurt you. (My voice was breaking bad here

**Nick:** Yeah

At this point

**Me:** I love you. 

At first he didn't answer

**Nick:** I know. I love you too. That's why you're here. 

I *did* start crying again then, “It's okay, Tobias” in my ear. And that is the first time I've fallen asleep in anyone's arms in almost two years. 

**TL;DR** Sexy times were not had

**Moral of the story:** Real life returns-from-exile are not nearly as cool as they are in the movies. They hurt. A fucking lot. Also

Thank you everybody who supported me and gave me advice from my very first confession. I don't think it's going to be easy for us to completely repair our relationship

And he loves me back. So there's that.

David= Jock. To. the. max. The baseball cap wearing, muscle car driving, abercrombie and fitch wardrobe country white boy. 

Me= out gay kid from the city who was pretty ""straight acting

So

One night I had requested help to move some stuff down into the basement. My bedroom was on the second floor, and frankly there was rarely a sober moment during my undergrad career. 

After we moved everything downstairs I rolled a joint for David and I as a method of saying thanks for all the help. He wanted another one so he asked me up to his room. 

He put on an episode of ""Clone High"" (remember that TV show) and we both sat on the bed. He started to play the guitar and we started to drink. I had been out for years, and had been for about 2 years.

We drank and talked for about an hour

Out of nowhere David moved closer to me and put his hand on my hand. I just looked into his beautiful brown eyes and frankly was a bit scared. I was still naive to the fact that straight boys experiment

He stood up, and frankly I was at half-mast at this point; the erection was noticible though my track pants. 

David just stood there and said nothing

I don't know if it was the drink, or whatever it was, but I just stood up and took off my pants. He pushed me back onto the bed and mounted me then and there. It was terrifying, and beautiful, all at the same time. 

We fucked for HOURS, we just reloaded and fucked somemore. It was a dizzying and non-believeable experience to say the least. 

I finally went back downstairs to my bedroom at 8am and passed out. I slept for 12 hours. I don't know if it was the massive amount of alcohol, drunken sex, or the massive amount of pot that we smoked, but my body needed to rest. I was awoken by the sound of his girlfriend knocking on his bedroom door, calling up to him and then ascending the stairs to the attic and his bedroom. 

When I woke up, trying to piece together the night before and attempting to strip fantasy away from reality. It wasn't until I smelled my hands and could still smell him on me that I realized we had fucked. 

He went home to his parents for about a week, we didn't hang out, we didn't even drink together when all of our housemates were getting ready for the bar. Nothing. For 2 weeks. And then one night I got a text.

All it said was, and I knew that I had to do nothing and let him make the moves. I wanted to fuck him again, and I knew it was wrong, but I didn't care. 

I rapidly texted back, climbed the stairs, and found him, in bed, under the sheets, with the fucking guitar on the bed and clone high on the computer screen. I knew he remembered, and I knew what he wanted to do.

This pattern continued for another 3 years. We would go about our seperate lives, even when we were both in relationships. 

We never told anyone about this. His girlfriend was never told, I became a physicist. We fucked for three years, and no one knew.

I lost contact with him after University

Yesterday, and I don't know why he invited me. But there we are...one of the dirtiest secrets in my life, laid bare for the internet to see.

Being an unattractive girl makes you invisible most of the time. People don't really care about my personality unless they have to, well, I'm not pretty enough for them. And it's not something I make up in my head, because I see the same people ready to accept pretty girls. Maybe they are just assholes, but it doesn't mean it isn't hurtful and that it doesn't get in the way. 

It's not like it's just me or this isn't a well known phenomenon. My friend was pretty unattractive until she lost a lot of weight. People were straight up dismissive of her. When she got pretty well then everyone wanted to be friends. She was invited places

I feel like no one really wants me around. At parties I just take up space that could be taken up by a pretty girl. 

I have a good personality, and it works I guess, but not without a ton of effort. When people get to know me, they really like me, they want me around and I do cool things and shit like that. People think I am funny and smart and cool and shit, but they assume the opposite it seems upon first seeing me.

And it's not like it's just that I am in the position that all guys are in. People like to make that claim. But guys aren't invisible. Even unattractive guys, I can see it's received better than the effort I put in.

I don't even want to be pretty or wanted sexually. I mean I do

I guess I'll start at the start. I was born in January 1991 to 2 junkie parents. (intravenous heroin users). My grandmother has passed and my grandfather has never cared to meet me.

My mom quit drugs

When I was 2
at my face because I wouldn't shut up

So, he told me how I was fat and worthless (much skinnier now, drugs will do that..but also clean now, just FYI) and when my mom wasn't around he would kick me over and over again in the legs and ass. My dad literally kicked my ass, for years. I'm sitting here in tears wondering why the fuck he couldn't even TRY to love me... I told him so many times I just wanted to make my dad proud.. but he was quick to remind me he was not my dad, just my step-dad who was fucking my mom, and I just ""came with the territory

He never once told me he loved me. I don't think anyone ever has... my mom probably did when I was a baby. but I don't remember..

I have 2 step siblings, maybe...

But I eventually moved out on my own.

um. what else..

I fell in love once. I fell so deeply in love with a girl named Hannah
My heart aches violently just thinking about her. I told her of my affection, and buy her anything her heart desired. I did it *so fucking willingly*. Ugh, I am a tool. I confess to her that I'm completely in love... and valentine's day was coming up. I asked her on a date. My very first date. SHE SAID YES.

So of course

I went and bought a $1

ON. VALENTINES. DAY. Do you know how much that cost me? As much as the fucking necklace nearly. My aunt owned the restaurant which is the only reason it was even a remote possibility. (and no

So. I drive to pick up Hannah. I'm already shaking so bad I can barely drive, and resume my drive.

I see her standing in her driveway. She looks perfect. Long, black shoes. Just... my absolute dream.. come to life. At this point I'm *literally* starting to rethink my atheism. Thoughts like ""there is no possible way that evolved. That woman was created in the mind of a beautiful divine being, and manifested just for me."" and ""this angel is my reward for waiting so patiently and dutifully for love"" were crossing my mind. Crazy thoughts. Crazy, beautiful thoughts that I wish to feel again one day.

We drive to the restaurant

Our waitress brings our menus

We're sitting there
She knows I'm in love with her

(paraphrasing here) ""I love you

and I gave her the necklace. She cried. She put it on. She went to the bathroom, and... put the necklace in front of me.

(paraphrasing here) she said ""iamreallylonely, and it was valentines day... but I can't see us being more than friends"".

I can't really tell you how the rest of the night went
A knife-in-the-heart-slowly-being-spun

The next day I tried to kill myself by taking a lot of aspirin. I know

Obviously I didn't die. I can't even kill myself right... FUCK.

But the fact that I had tried

I don't want to die... I just... don't want to live a lonely life of sadness and misery and insignificance. I don't want to continue being this monster... a monster made of love

Death isn't the answer, then I *will* find her one day.

But as of yet... nobody has ever loved me

I'm a male in my early twenties, straight people don't go around raping women. Why the fuck does everyone think paedophiles are going to go crazy and rape the first kid who looks cute? By the way, I'm gay.

I've been this way for a while. No parental abuse

**--- Edited out my arguments ""in favor"" that's not the point of this post. Maybe I would be a lot less depressed if I agreed that paedophilla was inherently wrong. ---**

My sister knows. I'm set up to get ""help"". I'm so fucking tired of people saying ""help"" is the solution. As if people have any idea what ""help"" entails. Am I going to discover that I'm actually attracted to people my age and my attraction to kids is part of a traumatic childhood I don't remember? Maybe I'll be told that I just have to develop ""coping mechanisms"" for dealing with the fact that I'll never be able to get into the kind of relationship I want to be in. Or maybe I'll go through some therapy to convert me to a more normal sexuality. The same kind that homosexuals of the past were forced through.

And you know what the worst part about this is? More than the fear, so hard, to convince myself that having sex with kids is inherently wrong, but I really can't. It doesn't make sense to me that having an orgasm would be fundamentally detrimental, and I think that anything beyond that is a factor of culture and society. But who the fuck am I to say that? I'm probably wrong anyway, after all, 99% of the rest of the world disagrees. I see people on Stormfront talk openly about the superiority of caucasians. I see religious people openly talk about how they KNOW god exits. All these groups of people are so sure of themselves...maybe I'm just as delusional as they are.

But it really doesn't matter. Because as I said

In any case

**--- EDIT: Apparently my reply has been downvoted into the negative. So I'll post it here. ---**

I guess I should probably state my opinion on sexuality in general and see if anyone can convince me otherwise. When I said that I didn't think having sex with a child was inherently wrong

For the time being I'm going to ignore arguments about pregnancy and STDs because they don't apply in my situation anyway and because I don't believe that paedophilla can be rejected solely because of them.

I can always remember thinking that contemporary views of sexuality were warped. Even as a kid I didn't like not being able to talk about sex. I had all these questions (like most kids do) but I was too embarrassed and ashamed to ask them. Later on I learned that there are appropriate times and places for those questions. I still don't know why talking about sexuality ever need be “inappropriate.”

Public nudity is something that still bothers me a lot. Why would it be illegal to walk around naked

I see a lot of of people tell me that being molested as a child is awful. I agree. It's fucking horrible. And I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry that kids are abused or exploited or put in a position they don't want to be. I'm sorry that it's embarrassing or awkward or just plain painful to talk about. And I'm sorry there wasn't anyone around to stop it because if I was there I would and there's no excuse for ignoring something like that.

However, but let's be honest. Not all childhood sexual experiences are rape. You could argue that they all technically are, and I guess legally that's true, but practically speaking they are not.

I know people. Several people. In real life. They've had sex with adults at ages as young as twelve and they don't regret it. Again

I feel like the main argument that children can't consent to sex fails because sex shouldn't be something that requires responsibility. I think that in contemporary society we always associate sexuality with a certain kind of commitment (at least some) and responsibility and I don't think that has to be the case. I think that sex can just be an expression of love or even just pleasure.

Let's paint a picture. What if you grew up in an alternate universe where sexuality was completely liberated? (Again, and to say no. Do you really think that sexual experiences, even unpleasant ones, would hold the same emotional baggage?

We teach kids from a young age to cover their bodies under clothing. We purposely hide sexuality from them until they're “old enough” to understand it. I don't think this is healthy. I don't think this is ethical. And I think that it causes a lot of questions and emotional issues for the majority of people growing up. Especially when they get into their first sexual experience.

The idea that sexuality is destroys a child's innocence is ridiculous in my opinion. We shouldn't hide sex with children. And in an ideal world it wouldn't matter if I fucked a kid or not because sex wouldn't be taken that seriously. It would be seen as a normal urge to explore and have fun with and not suppressed while at the same time obsessed with like it is today.

But you know what? It doesn't matter. Because I don't live in that kind of world. And the people who argue against paedophilla are right. Having sexual experiences at a young age will fuck you up. Can you imagine being in that position? Someone touching you in a place where you were taught your whole life shouldn't be touched. Not knowing what is happening or why you're feeling funny and being too scared and embarrassed to tell the other person to stop.

Even if you're older. Let's say 14. And you want to have sex with another person. Is it worth it to deal with the pressure? Not being able to tell anyone. Not knowing whether what you did was right or if you're really just fucked up and you don't realize it yet. Not knowing whether you fucked up the other person.

When society makes something damaging, we wouldn't have nearly as many child molesters running around. I'm not arguing that such a society will ever appear. And I'm not saying that it would be some sort of Utopia. But I do think that our current views of sexuality are completely skewed.

So now I live in this society where I can't have relationships with the kids I want to, because I enabled it to happen.

We also drove across the country together, I was raised in the rural South and didn't have any kind of experience with that kind of thing. The first time he made a pass at me, I thought he was gonna fight me. It was definitely the hottest sex I've ever had though, completely different than girls obviously but also different because it was *him*. It was passionate but it was tender too, it wasn't like anything I'd experienced before. We never really talked about it, it was just an accepted part of our relationship, and it did get more and more intense the longer it went on. We never ""dated"" or anything, we were just always together and it worked. And we both slept off and on with women during college at this point but it was just Saturday night sport. We used women for casual drunken sex and then withheld intimacy from them because we were only willing to give it to each other. 

The last time we were together he came up behind me while I was washing dishes at the sink and just put his arms around me and put his lips against the back of my neck. It was the first intimate contact we'd had in weeks. I hadn't been with anyone else almost two years at that point. It was after a dinner where two of our friends were engaged and getting ready to be married, even though we were so used to it by then.

1359906947.0,17t653,I think I killed my ex fiancee.,confessionthrow4,361,92,127,"Sorry for the throwaway

I started dating her years ago after meeting online, accepting of me and my flaws and my past and how I was just your average jobless nerd who stayed inside playing video games constantly. I couldn't believe my luck in finding her. We lived a couple of hundred miles away from each other, but saw each other as much as we could sometimes spending a month or so together, and the rest of the time we'd talk all day and play games online. MMOs, multiplayer games.. I never got tired of talking to her and I couldn't believe it but she actually seemed to adore me. 

She suffered from low confidence at first mainly to do with her weight. She was obese. I didn't mind this at all.. I thought her body was genuinely beautiful. I've always liked bigger girls anyway, I saw her health was good, definitely not as greedy as me (I've always been skinny) and ate better.. So yeah, in no way did I care about her weight. I'd reassure her, always remind her that I thought she was beautiful, point out that her lifestyle wasn't shit and that perhaps some people are just fat.. that she should remember that as long as shes happy with how she lives, she shouldn't hate herself. Eventually she began to believe me and it was the most awesome thing. She'd send me pictures of her wearing new prettier clothes instead of loose ones as her confidence went up, take care of her

Quite soon after I proposed to her, for years.. but she always seemed to 'fall' into dating somebody else.. we'd 'lose contact' for a few months and then regain it, and she'd be dating someone. This happened so much. She said she still loved me, I'd still be hung up on her.. give her attention and affection and love, sometimes when she already had another boyfriend.. Yeah I'm a fucking idiot. Eventually she disappeared completely. I was pretty distraught by her disappearance, but slowly got over it and a couple of years later I met my girlfriend... so yeah.

But she had emailed me now. How she missed me. She was single, that she wanted me, we should make a go of it, break up with my fiancee.

I'd like to say I hesitated. I wish I fucking had.. but it was THAT ex and she was saying all these things. 4 months after proposing to my girlfriend

I told the ex I was single again, we planned to meet up and 'get things going', talk about our relationship face to face. I was so pleased that things had worked out. Then she disappeared for an agonizing two months and came back telling me she was with someone else yet again, not giving a shit about me, and then disappeared again after telling me one night. Havn't spoken to her since. So there you go. 

I was heartbroken and angry, apologize but I couldn't face it. I knew I'd have to explain at some point and I just couldn't. I couldn't bear telling her I had made a mistake after what I did. I did start speaking to her again though, on and off, played games together.. she was still the same person, but distant, and I wanted her so badly I didnt know how to say it.

At one point I was talking to a few friends of mine in a group chat, your fiancee was a fatass anyway, bet you're glad to be rid of her'.. I found myself agreeing, to save face. I joined in on mocking her, said some fucking horrible things about her and her weight. A lot of things. We all did, but I was the worst. I meant none of it. I don't know why I went that far.

What I didn't realise was in the group chat was one of my ex-fiancees friends who kept silent.. and who told my ex-fiancee everything I had said. When I found out (from another friend) I was fucking terrified. I had ruined any chance and not only that

She spoke to me less, she was always so nice and considerate of people.. even still played stuff together sometimes and laughed together, and she never once mentioned it and that killed me. She didn't know that I knew she knew, I suppose. And she was being perfectly nice to me. 

Eventually that contact trailed off, got into a routine again. Didn't find anyone else. Just alone in my room. No job, living with my parents, playing games, life gone to shit, no motivation anymore. Fast forward about two years, I get an email from one of her friends, saying she had died. She was 25.

I got her Moms home number from the friend and rang my ex-fiancees Mom wanting to know what happened. It was horrible

Apparently my ex-fiancee suddenly started dieting, that she was starving herself pretty extremely, eating nothing for days on end. They tried to make her get better her Mom said, but it was like she was terrified of any sort of food. She killed herself, alcohol and drugs which we still don't know where she got them from. She was teetotal up until the moment she killed herself, never so much as took an aspirin either. Apparently there were mounds of diet pills in there that no one knew she had. She left a letter before she did it, which her mom showed me, that her way was the only way that was working to lose weight because nothing else did and no one listened to her

It's been a few months. Her Mom still feels guilty but I know the blame is on me. I just know it. Her mom doesn't know what I did, that my ex-fiancee was heartbroken but never had a bad word to say about me, always said how wonderful I was.. that my fiancee respected my decision to break up with her.. never a bad word.. and apparently she had said that she'll always love me. Her mom said 'these things just happen, people fall out of love, I cant blame you for falling out of love. I know you care'. She said those words and its like the whole world blurred as I heard them. She gave me a hug then and I felt sick to my stomach. She didn't know I had caused all this. She didn't know anything and I couldnt tell her. I still can't. She even sent me a christmas card with such nice words in, thanking me for going to see her and remembering her daughter even though we had been broken up for a long time when she died. I couldn't tell her I had been thinking about her every day.

She showed me pictures of my ex-fiancee too from a little while before she died.. she had shrunk so quickly with the eating disorder. She wasn't skinny when she died. Just smaller than she was. Looking ill. I saw pictures of where her hair was patchy and falling out. Pale and bags under the eyes. None of her beautiful smile. I see those pictures every day in my head. I can't take this. I feel like my life is over.

I still love her. She was the best thing that had happened to me and much better than I ever deserved. I love her so

This is hard to confess to. For the last two months I have become nearly obssessed with seeing my stepdaughter naked. 

Three nights ago my wife came home exhausted from work and fell asleep on the bed

I gave her about 2 mins and stood on a chair outside the bathroom door, firm and pointed...and my eyes were always drawn back to the natural dark hair between her legs. It was incredibly sexually exciting. I was nervous as hell, but I could not look away. Eventually nerves got the better of me and I stood down, but I was back within two minutes after I found my wife still fast asleep.

I watched her again for two or three minutes until she finished showering. Her body entranced me as I tried to commit her to memory

Afterwards

I have betrayed them both. In silence and without witnesses I have broken the sanctity and safety of my home through a truly *basic* lust I feel towards a young woman who has entirely placed her trust in me for providing a safe place to live. She suspects nothing. My wife suspects nothing. But I have intruded upon her and I will probably do so again.

I'm a foul person.

1365022424.0,1bm32m,I'm in love with my straight best friend.,homonomo,350,81,66,"I'm a gay male. My best friend is straight. I've known him since I was a freshman in university, and we're going across the country -- me to NYC

I love him. It started sophomore year. I just started crushing on him, and his response was, ""I wish you wouldn't make such a big deal about it. You act like it's something to be ashamed of."" then he gave me a bro-hug, and it was never an issue. He would always ask me what guys I found attractive, etc. Like I was his brother. 

Flash forward to the summer of junior year. It's my birthday, and I told him no (which was the truth). Then he went on and on about how I deserve the perfect guy, anyone would be lucky to have me, etc. We were at my parents' lake house at the time, and Jake was going to sleep on the floor, but I said he could sleep in the bed with me if he didn't think it'd be too weird. (NOTE: *I had NO ulterior motives planned -- I just didn't think it right he slept on the floor while I had the bed to myself.*) 

Jake laughed and his response was, and I could feel his dick pressed up against me. I woke up and looked at him, but he was asleep. He was groping me in his sleep. My heart was racing, and I slept on the couch downstairs after that. 

From that point on, but I couldn't. 

And let's go back to New Year's Eve. I was so fucking drunk at a party that Jake was throwing at his house. I ended up passing out in the bathroom. I woke up in his bed, and I assumed he was. I remember looking at him and asking him what time it was, and he just asked me, ""How drunk are you?"" and I laughed and said, ""Pretty drunk."" *Then* he asked me the question I'll never cease to forget: ""*Are you drunk enough to not remember?*"" I just giggled like an idiot because, hello, I downed shot after shot of hard liquor.

Then Jake pulled me up into his lap and just -- cuddled me? I guess that's the word to use. He rubbed my back and just cuddled me. 

Nothing happened after that, and I plan on telling him after we graduate so I can just get it out. Keeping something like this bottled up inside fucking hurts.

Flash forward to earlier this month. We were visiting his parents to give them the news in person that I was finally pregnant (we had been trying for months). During dinner a woman I had never met came up to our table and started talking to Dave like she was an old friend of his. At the time all he said by way of explanation was that they had gone to high school together.

Last week I noticed the same woman making a comment on his Facebook wall. I didn't even know they were facebook friends so I asked him about it. He said that she had added him as a facebook friend after running into us at that restaurant. I wasn't jealous or anything but I was just curious so I asked him if they'd ever had any kind of romantic relationship back in highschool. He was understandably uncomfortable by the question but I swore to him that I didn't care. Finally he said that yeah

I did not care. I'm facebook friends with some of my former partners too. But one thing didn't make sense: he had told me that he lost his virginity when he was 20. How could she be one of his five since he moved away from home after highschool and obviously she hadn't?

I admit I laughed at that. I said

He just looked at me blankly and said

I was stunned. I just said

A few minutes later he said

When I admitted I had he seemed shocked. He said

I'll admit

1357663457.0,166v0k,I did something unspeakably horrible,ANUS_CONE,443,183,88,"I have to get this off my chest. Only my best friend knows about this

I was extremely athletic in high school. I played football (I was actually a D-1 prospect), as I exercised enough that it really didn't matter how much I ate. I would estimate that I probably took in anywhere from 5,000-8,000 calories in any given day, and I stayed between 10% and 11.5% body fat pretty much at all times.

When I was 17, and re-tore it wakeboarding, and had to basically quit all of my sports. I was given the option to have surgery, which would have allowed me to possibly play the last game of the season in football, but never be able to throw again, or not have surgery and just do physical therapy and sit out football/track anyway and deal with a longer recovery. I picked option #2, since it seemed like I wasn't going to play football/track any more anyway

Long story short, but my eating habits never did. I gained a lot of weight. 

Anyway, lets call them Lester and Jim. L&amp;J were pretty much my best friends since forever. We really liked living together.

Lester, Jim played WoW with me. We had good times. We were all over at Cunt's house one night. Me and Jim were playing some WoW at the kitchen table and Lester and Cunt decided to go get some ice cream. Being the fatasses that we were, we just gave them money and had them bring ours back. 

Anyways, I've gotta shit man. It's fucking bad. I've never felt like this before"". Jim said something back along the lines of ""Quit being a pussy, you can go shit in like 15 minutes after we kill all of this trash, etc."" (for anyone who knows WoW, I know what you're thinking - trash would be the perfect time to go take a poo. You got kicked from the guild we were in for afk'ing trash.).

Anyways

I let this little relief fart slip, and we can both still smell this thing. Jim is like, ""Dude, that is the worst thing I've ever smelled."" I still feel greasy at this point, but I have no idea what I've done, still.

I get up in another 5 minutes, there was a huge puddle of it in the chair. It wasn't just shit, either. It was this orange puddle of what looked like a mix of the grease that comes off of baby back ribs and movie theatre popcorn butter. It's running down my leg. It's stained the fuck out of this white cloth chair that I'm sitting in. This was the most scared that I've ever been in my life.

**Side note/explanation:**

(I had been on the weight loss drug Alli for about a day

**Anyway...**

All sorts of things start running through my head. ""What is Lester going to do? There's no way he'll still be friends with me after I shit on his girlfriend's chair! He'll want me to move out!"" etc. Cunt happened to be in a sorority, not to mention the other members of her sorority. I was humiliated.

I frantically got up

They came in, and I managed to hold back my tears of fear. I told Jim to get me the fuck out of there. We left, bought a chair identical to the one that I shit on, and replaced it while Cunt wasn't looking. She or Lester never found out. Nobody except for me and Jim knows this, and I've blackmailed Jim to an oath of secrecy. I just had to get this out.

**Update**

Thank you all for the support in your kind comments. I'll fill you in on my life since this event

I quit taking Alli after this incident. This happened in early 2009. I took the stuff because I thought it would be an easy way to lose some weight, I lost about 100 lbs eating healthy and exercising. I'm not back to my peak condition, but I feel good about myself and my lifestyle now, so I'm good with it. 

I graduated college in 2012, and I'm having a kid in July. All in all, I feel like I picked up the pieces and carried on pretty well.

The church/cult had three tenants the apostle (leader of the cult) was most obsessed with. 1. Women are to be subservient to men in all ways. 2. The government is out to get us. 3. Only the apostle can tell outsiders of our church's existence. 

The cult was very secretive. I was taught at the age of five or six how to keep my eye out for possible government watchers, and urged us all to constantly search for such devices ourselves. Even at school I was supposed to keep an eye out for spies and government infiltrators. When a teacher once told the class that the earth revolved around the sun I reported this to my parents and they promptly had me transferred to another school. My first small act of rebellion may have been when the new school taught the same ungodly principles and I did not tell my parents. I'd lost my friends once and didn't want to go through that again.

Our church meetings were just as secretive. Never held in the same house twice in a row. We would get in the car when we weren't hosting, sometimes my dad had empty boxes wrapped in wrapping paper, my bother and I would carry balloons. These were the lessons the apostle gave about how to avoid suspicion. If it looked like we were going to a party or some other social gathering our church's discovery would be far less likely.

The actual meetings were usually held in basements because the danger of being around upstairs windows was too great

We met twice a week after dinner and usually got home at 10. But each time either my dad or mother, sometimes later. These were the advanced meetings. I was too young to go to them. Until I turned fourteen.

My mother told me that on my fourteenth birthday I would be baptized again by the apostle

That night she and my dad dropped me off at the apostle's house. I was wearing the nicest dress I owned

Our church was very small. 30-35 members including all the children. Of those there were now 18 full members who had been baptized by fire. Over the next three months I had sex with every one of them and in every way you can imagine during our advanced lessons. At home I was also subservient to my father and brother.

Things were very chaotic for me at this time. I was in constant pain and didn't understand why the holy spirit wasn't filling me with joy the way the apostle kept promising it would. I lied and said I did and I continued to be a devoted member. Until one day at school the pain (severe cramping, burning) became so much that I tried to get up from my desk in class to go use the bathroom. I felt dizzy and lightheaded. The next thing I remember is being in a hospital bed.

I was told later that I nearly bled out. My mom had thought I was just having a very heavy flow so she had stocked me up with pads and I'd been going through one an hour. But it turns out that some internal tearing combined with a miscarriage had led me to nearly die. 

It took over two weeks before the police got involved because they had no evidence of any crime. My parents had feigned ignorance about me being sexually active and the cops had gone off on a wild goose chase for a possible rapist in town

Everything unraveled then. My brother (who my father would later scream ""JUDAS! JUDAS! to during a court hearing) spilled most of the details first. The apostle was found and arrested

It took a very long time before I was de-programmed all the way. I believed so much now that everything the apostle had said was coming true, defeating us, and it was all my fault for being weak.

The state needed me as a witness so the trial against my dad and the apostle

After he was convicted my dad plead guilty to avoid the maximum penalties. My mom's lawyer got her institutionalized in a mental hospital as part of a plea agreement that she would cooberate some of me and my brother's testimony. A few other members of the church also got plea deals. I don't know what happened to the rest but I know at least a few members got off scot free.

After nearly a year of being in the care of the state I was finally allowed to move to my grandparent's house in another state. They have been good parents to me. I have not seen my dad since his sentencing hearing. I have not seen my mom since the day I was supposed to be discharged from the hospital

This weekend he stole money from my purse so that he could buy a book at the book fair at school... just two days after he took my Kindle and denied, until we caught him with it in the middle of the night.

Looking at all these beautiful replies I wish I'd posted this from my main account. A lot of questions are about why I cannot travel and why I feel bad about street view.

I cannot travel because I have a startup tied to my location and I cannot leave it at all for a few years - it's in early stages. I think I feel bad about what I do on street view because nearly all my facebook-friends have travelled A LOT. They constantly post awesome pictures from all over the world and although I pretend what I do is way more important and will give me the freedom to travel in maybe 5-6 years

I absolutely agree it's wonderfully great technology though - what if I were disabled or homeless next to a starbucks with an iphone that someone threw my way because they wanted a newer version? It's revolutionary stuff.

I've felt a lot of shame about this over the years but I feel like it's something I need to get off my chest

When I was ten years old I had a good friend (I'll call him Dean, so they lived in constant fear.  Blinds drawn, doors triple locked, he was never allowed outside.  It was a sad and strange situation.  Because he wasn't allowed outside I spent a lot of time playing with him at his house.  He had a lot of sweet toys, nintendo, trading cards, games.  I would often sleep over and we would play together for hours.

Paula was probably in her late 30's at the time.  She was blonde

One day I came over to play with Dean and she asked who it was without opening the door.  She seemed really scared that someone was knocking by the tone of her voice. She said through the door that he was at his grandmas house and that I should go.  I turned and started going down the stairs when she suddenly opened the door and poked her head out.  She told me that he would be home in a few minutes and that if I wanted to wait for him inside then I could.

I went in and she was just home from work, white pantyhose and high heels.  I remember that outfit to this day because it's burned into my mind.  I sat on the couch and she sat next to me.  She started asking me questions about how Dean was behaving at school and other things about her son.  The whole time she was crossing and uncrossing her legs and dangling one of her shoes off.

She kicked the heels off and told me that her feet were hurting from working all day and asked if I would mind giving her a foot massage.  I felt a little weird about it but I said ok.  She laid down on the couch and put her feet on my lap with her legs spread slightly apart and I rubbed her feet for her.  She said her calves hurt and asked me to rub her legs too so I did.  

At that point she took one of my hands and moved it up to her crotch and asked me if I would rub that too.  I was really uncomfortable but I just did it anyway.  I don't want to get into too much detail here because it's pretty perverse but she ended up making me give her oral sex.  When I was done she gave me oral sex too

I lost touch with Dean over the years and never told a soul about this

Not too long ago I tried to find Him/her online but besides an obituary mentioning her there was nothing else

It was awhile after I moved into my aunt's house that my mom was allowed to come see me, and I thought she was starting to do better. I could forgive her for the things she had done to me, and I began to warm up to her. Our relationship started to turn around until she came to her sister's home, quite obviously high. My aunt tried to shield me from her as she tried to come through the front door, but the look in her eyes was all too familiar. 

That trust was broken again and I was extremely angry. The months of reconnecting had all been ruined, and I couldn't scream. I could only look at her in the eye and let the tears come down silently and tell her to kill herself. I don't fucking love you, and you should just kill yourself. It's not worth your time to try anymore. Just die already. She turned around and hung herself in her room a few miles away on September 3, 2006. Almost exactly six years ago.

1337709465.0,tzkl9,I had an 18 month long love affair with my niece,joe-no-mo,294,52,45,"My niece is only a year younger than me. I was born when my sister was in her early 20s and she had her first child “Melinda” when I was only about a year old. Until I was about ten my sister lived with me

Melinda went to the same highschool as me. Whenever she saw me in the halls she used to say “Hey, and pretty hot, and we got along really well. But she was technically my niece. Her mom shared the same parents as I did you know?

We stayed in touch through college but only barely. I would hear things about her through my mom or sister and occasionally she would give me a call (usually regarding family related matters) or I'd send her an e-mail but we pretty much became extended family for a while. Then one day she called to tell me she was thinking of moving to the Big City where I now lived. We were both in our mid 20s by now. She asked if she could come for a visit so she could see what the city was like. I had recently kicked out my roommate so I had a spare room (first time living 100% alone! Fuck yeah) so I told her sure

It had been about a year since I'd last seen her and I have to tell you when I met her at the airport I felt something that made me feel embarrassed. I was really attracted to her. I had always acknowledged she was good looking but I had never had any sexual desire for her. Now? Its hard to explain but just the way she carried herself and her hair and everything else, she was my niece. It's not like anything was going to happen, nor should it.

Until it did. Her third night there we were getting drunk at my apartment when I realized she was flirting with me. She was talking about the disaster that had been her last relationship and how she woke up one morning realizing she had to get away and her first thought was trying to make it in the Big City like her favorite Uncle had. She joked and teased, like: “Oh, you've got an eyelash on your cheek, here let me get it”) and kept asking me questions about my own romantic adventures. I was sober enough to know what she was doing but drunk enough not to care. So when that moment came, that awkward moment where you're looking into her eyes and you can just sense she wants you to do it, I did. I kissed her.

The next morning over breakfast she insisted we talk about what we had done even though I would have rather just pretend nothing had happened. Finally I said the big “I” word: incest. She told me she was on birth control so she wasn't about to get pregnant so I didn't have to worry. And why, she argued, and she also admitted to having had feelings for me since highschool. She was tired of ending up with jerks and losers and I was neither. It wasn't fair that I had to be off limits just because technically she was my niece.

Little Tim did the thinking for me. It wanted to agree with everything she said. Eventually I was even adding my own rationalizations

This post has gone on long enough so I'll just sum the rest up. Melinda ended up living with me for the next eighteen months as my girlfriend. Eventually I met a woman who didn't have the handicap of being my sister's daughter and I fell in love with her. I told Melinda we had to break up and even told her why. She was upset at first but a couple days later she said that it would had to have happened eventually anyway. Our unique relationship was way too complicated. She asked if she could continue staying with me

That's my confession. Nobody in our family knows about it, isn't that Melinda in that photo with your sister? With the comment 'me with my big girl on her Xth birthday?”. Otherwise I'm sure more people would have put two and two together.

Since a young age, until I started to take a good look at the world around me and realized how empty Indian people's lives really are. Now I feel like a total fool. I'd wash my skin white if I could. I'd go back in time and learn how relationships work so I'm not a total manchild at the age of 21 (which I currently am) and so I can actually start building my own love life. But as it stands now, I have no experience in anything and am weighed down by this stupid Indianness.

I don't like people assuming that I have to be a doctor or lawyer or engineer, not because I want to make money.

He enjoys wearing high heels and owns more than me probably and he also likes me to wear high heels as much as possible. He also likes to wear stockings/tights and leggings as well as skirts. He doesn't like wearing make up however he does like to wear fake nails and paints his toe nails. 

Recently he shaved his legs so they would look better in heels. I just don't know how to feel about this. He assures me he is straight but has told me in the past that he sometimes feels like he should be a woman. He insists that he doesn't actually want to be a woman but does so that he could wear heels all the time with it being acceptable.

I spoke with my boyfriend tonight. He has assured me that he does not want to become a woman however sometimes feels it would be easier to be a woman as he could then freely wear high heels.

I am currently working with my father, our relationship ended rather painfully shortly after last year's conference and I never really got over her. During last year's conference, I finally obtained the means to videochat with her. The memories of speaking to her face to face were painful ones to relive this time around. So I was pretty lonely and upset for the beginning of the conference. Until last night that is.

Last night, his boss, one of our co-workers, and I went up to the boss's suite to drink some moonshine my dad had purchased in Tennessee. Drinking with my dad was nothing new, I had done it before. But never too much. And certainly not moonshine. I had a couple shots while my dad got buzzed and our co-worker and boss got shitfaced. When the conversation started to lean a bit towards the raunchy side, my dad pulled the plug. I walked him to his room and he went to bed.

I then went to the hotel lobby to get on the internet with my computer. By this time, kinky, uninhibited animal. You can tell from the way she acts with her fiance. She was obviously completely hammered. She invited me to come with her to her room to get some things, then head back up to the boss's suite for some more moonshine. I have no idea what I was thinking. But I went with her. Cautiously.

As we walked back to her room she revealed to me that she had spent the night with a woman the night before and we were going to see if she was still in the room to get some weed from her. This excited me for a number of what are most likely obvious reasons. We get into the room and the woman was gone. She went into the restroom and I sat on a bench. She left the door open as she walked into the restroom to use the toilet and spoke to me through a mirror that allowed me to look directly at her. I had never seen a naked woman I'm not related to in my life before that moment. I was instantly aroused

She proceeded to lay down on the bed and begin to talk to me. She asked me what we had in common. For a good 30 minutes, drugs, sex, our opinions of society. Jane and I are very similar in a lot of ways. After our talk, we got up to head back up to boss's room. We got up there and Boss was quite obviously just as far gone as Jane. He was a little more mindful though and refused to give me anymore booze. Jane handed me her glass and I drank about half of it. Boss noted the promiscuity Jane was flaunting and took it as opportunity to get laid. He said goodnight and told me to head to bed. I didn't really want to, as by that point I was buzzed myself and pretty hot and bothered by the site I beheld in Jane's room. However, I was also quite anxious and nervous about the entire situation. I had never experienced anything even remotely like that before. It seemed Jane already had a plan of her own

She held my arm supposedly to help her walk, then retire to my own on the fourth floor, where my fourteen-year-old sister was already fast asleep. Despite my arousal, I was still somewhat in my right mind. Until we reached her room, that is. She opened her door and pulled me in after her. I sat on the bench as she sat on the bed. She said, ""You might want to take off your shoes, I doubt they'll be very comfortable to sleep in."" I told her that I couldn't sleep there, but somehow she convinced me to remove my shoes and move onto her bed.

I sat on the very edge so she couldn't tell how fast my heart was beating and how deeply I was breathing. She gradually shifted herself over to me where she began to caress my leg. I laughed a little and she realized I was ticklish. She pushed me off of the bed and started to tickle me. I resisted, she then pulled me up onto the bed with her and, as I lay down to prevent her from tickling me any more, she wrapped herself around me, positioned my head between her breasts and her legs. She asked me if I enjoyed it. I was speechless. I told her I didn't know. She said she thought I did. I told her I thought we would both regret it the next day. She assured me she was very much aware of what was happening and that she would not regret it as long as no one else knew. In all of my anxiety and arousal, I agreed to remain quiet. I knew my dad would kill both of us if he knew.

She rolled over and pulled me on top of her. She asked me if I had ever kissed a girl. I told her no. She laughed and told me she wasn't sure if she wanted to take that from me. She asked me what I wanted. It took a little coercion but eventually I admitted I wanted to kiss her. She said that she wasn't seeing any evidence of that. I had no idea if it really was what I wanted, I lied down on the bed and she rested her head in the space between my neck and shoulder. I continued to massage her chest until we both fell asleep.

I woke up at 4:30 in the morning, trying to make sense of the morning's events. Eventually, I retreated to my room and browsed reddit on my phone to take my mind off of it until I fell asleep. My hands shake as I type this. I now have to go back to work and face Jane and my boss and my dad. I am having trouble breathing. I don't know what to think or say or do. Please help me.

Edit: Paragraphs at /u/AliceA's request. Minus indentations. My tab doesn't seem to work.

Update: So we're about half way through the work day. I'm taking a lunch break now. I've been keeping up with replies on my phone

Also, she came down to the lobby so I walked with her for a bit."" He asked if I went into Jane's room. I told him no. ""Why would I go in her room?"" ""Well, I don't know but I don't want you hanging out with them when I'm not around."" He seems to have let it go for now. I'm still not sure how much he really knows.

I'd like to thank everyone that has supported me in this thread. Even if it's not true, actually care. That makes me happy. I'd like to extend even greater thanks to /u/AliceA. Her reply gave me the first moments of easy breathing I experienced today. I head back home tomorrow. I've decided to try not to let this consume me. I don't want it to affect me or traumatize me or anything like that. So I'll learn from my mistake and move on, put this whole ordeal behind me. I'll find someone who I can experience a real first kiss with soon enough.

Again

Update #2: Okay, people seem to think I am not actually 15. I pride myself on my ability to use correct grammar, spelling, syntax, etc. Hence, I strive to exhibit that ability whenever possible.

So, I was talking to this really pretty girl. I don't even remember her name. It was really loud, but Bud dragged me away from it all and had this weird look on his face. I can't explain it. But he told me that he needed to get home, and didn't want to be alone. I was sober enough to know that he was probably drunk off his ass, so we caught the bus and headed out.

When we got back to our apartment, and started laughing. Then he told me, ""I have an exam tomorrow. I think I'm going to kill myself.""

I'm in my mid 20s and work for a small company as a receptionist. Most of my coworkers are men. From day one I was getting hit on by a lot of the guys but it's in my nature to want to be the Cool Girl so I just went with it. They all knew I had a long time boyfriend who I live with so most of the flirting &amp; sexist remarks were just in good fun. They would try to embarrass me and I'd just roll with it and give it back. Honestly

All except for Randall (that's not his real name). He gave me a bad vibe from day one. He was always quiet and didn't join in the breakroom banter like the other guys but the way he looked at me was always disconcerting. Also

One day my boss asked me if I could stay late to finish a new database entry project. This was not unusual. I often stay late at work and sort of rely on the overtime that provides. That particular day I didn't finish up until about eight, all of that.

While in the warehouse I was attacked by Randall. It turns out he had waited the entire time for me to come back there (the doors separating the warehouse from the front office lock automatically after 5 and only a couple people

He tore at my clothes after that leaving them in tatters. He held me down with one hand around my neck while he mauled my body with the other. I was absolutely terrified. I honestly thought he wanted to kill me. But I do admit that for some reason

I've been told this isn't unheard of. Some say it's the body's way of defending itself during a rape so that the damage is minimized. But to be honest it was more than that for me. The thing I can't tell anyone is that I actually had several orgasms during the assault even though the actual rape didn't last very long.

Don't get me wrong: as soon as he was gone I was a crying mess and the first thing I did was call 911. And I was in severe pain, and my breasts (he mauled the hell out of them) among other things. I was in the hospital for two days and did everything I was expected to do. Randall was arrested and pleaded guilty to two of the four counts he was charged with. At the last minute he changed his mind about some other counts he was charged with and so there will be a trial but everyone tells me it will be a slam dunk case. I probably don't even need to testify.

Everyone in my life, but I can tell. My dad doesn't understand why I don't sue the company and is outraged I still work there (I got a long paid leave after the assault but I did return).

Suicide for many is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and is a natural inclination for those that feel overwhelmed and have had enough. I have had hundreds of suicidal callers that were resolved over the phone. I admire the strength of those that survive their darkness and persevere.


Not to boast

For a long time now, hour to hour, it is always there. All the ways of doing it – as a fantasy. Callers often throughout a call begin to see value in themselves, where previously there was none. They begin to see themselves as worthy of living. I love guiding people through this, and admire all these people, but it is not a transition I have ever felt, and seems alien to me. At best, often to get through everyday social discourse.

I started university 2 years back and had, decent grades, cool professors, and my tuition was paid for, but I was living at home to save money. In hindsight this was a bad idea, but at the time it was working out.

Fast forward to second semester. I charge in headstrong, however, I started up a habit of skipping class. By skipping class, I don't mean blowing it off to go chill or whatever, I mean just sitting in the library doing nothing. I have pages of nothing but sequential numbers scribbled as small as I could write them. I felt I had to write these numbers. Also, about this time I began obsessively writing lists, transcribing anything near enough to read, so I dropped a class and tried balancing out my workload. No good, I decided to see a campus councilor. She offered me medical withdrawal for severe depression with obsessive compulsive behaviors and gave me the offices and people I had to see.

You see, not my sister, not my friends. To the best of their knowledge I was enjoying a second semester just as fruitful as the first. Understand that I don't trust anyone with anything and 99% of the time I have a strict policy of never committing thoughts or ideas to paper or writing. This also comes with the obligatory 'never discuss your feelings ever'. As you can imagine I'm a riot at parties.

Well

Now I'm sitting here. 2 years later. Looking over my shoulder, I still live at home. I used to spend days walking around aimlessly, but I kept getting the feeling that I was being followed, so I limited myself to campus, and the feeling persisted, so now I try to hide all day until my 'classes' are over and hope no one notices me. This tears at me every day the fear and anxiety gnaw at me all the time and I just keep lying to my family and tell them that school is going great. I've spent my tuition savings on trying to make it look like I have money from a part time job, you know, gifts

Since this is a throwaway confession I guess I'll also admit that I do have some bad hallucinations sometimes, but I killed them all and it sucks because some of the I genuinely cared about and absolutely adored and now they are nailed to trees in the woods behind our house. 

I realize this is some not good stuff and I guess I'm sitting here crying because it's taken me a long time to even admit to myself that I can't take care of this. I'm looking at two options right now

1375271919.0,1jez8r,"I was one of ""those"" teachers (x-post /r offmychest)",ThrowawayCathartic,278,60,150,"I was one of ""those"" teachers that had a relationship with a student and it justifiably ruined my life.
I had just turned 25; she was 18 and already graduated. During the school year she would often come to my office hours for assistance with her assignments, the sincere effort with which she put towards her work and life, and which I, a new teacher in his second year, was often too overwhelmed to feel. It became evident that she had a crush on me; I liked the attention and, knowing full well it was wrong, indulged in fantasies about this girl. At the end of the school year, ""If there is ever anything YOU need..."" with her number and email.

We kept in contact and had those long, deluded lovers do. That March I had just gotten out of a long relationship with the girl I dated throughout college and lived with for a year, which isn't an excuse, but certainly did contribute to my willingness to participate. Within six weeks after graduation, we had a date for her to come to my apartment.

We carried on from July to January. She would visit me on weekends that she came home from school (roughly two hours away) and we would often chat/webcam in between. She predictably ended up ""not feeling the same anymore"" and ended the relationship. And I completely understood why: it was pure fantasy and lust. We were both convinced that each other was something we were not: her that I was someone truly accomplished and I that she was a manic pixie dream girl. Neither was true.

She stopped talking to me and a month later when I tried to contact her I found out she had a boyfriend. It hurt, two years since this all began, is what happened next.

Over Spring Break, they were probably told, despite her protests to the contrary. They pretended their visit was to give me Easter candy, but a week later I'd find out that was a ruse and that immediately after they reported the relationship to the administration. Soon after, I was told that I would not be rehired (still un-tenured at this point) with no justification why. My supervisor, who did not agree with the decision, later revealed to me that it was because of a ""rumor"" that I had a relationship with a student. I was devastated. I loved my job, was rated highly on teacher-rating websites and I was popular with the students. None of that mattered in the end.

Fast-forward to now and I am employed in an education-related position, but since it is a small business it is unclear when I will be able to take over that role. Part of me would like to go back to teaching, but I don't know that I can ever get a teaching job again; even though my record wasn't sullied by my transgression, I was still forced to resign, and it's difficult to explain why I would resign and then go back to teaching so quickly. I don't know what else I'm qualified to do and it has wrecked my self-esteem.

I was empowered as a teacher. I had worked hard to get that job, like now, I fall into a terrible negative feedback loop where I ruminate on how I was dumped by a 19 year old; how her next boyfriend had a job straight out of school as a software engineer making 90k+; how I am so mired in responsibilities and debt that even if I could develop the skills to do something else, I lack the time and the means. The original goal was to be a teacher so I could always be reading and writing, and maybe end up writing something I was proud of one day. Now I won't allow myself to write because of the stress from my career and financial situation.

I don't always feel this pathetic. I have a girlfriend who is caring and successful and who sees what I have to offer--she doesn't know about all of this though. I do have the support of my family if I ever need it. I could move back home if need be and pay my debts, as I am valuable to my current organization, though they don't have the means to compensate me more for that. But then there are nights like these when I wake up at 4am and get to relive my greatest mistake. Even though I probably deserve what I've gotten, I don't think I'm a bad man. I've only ever had the best of intentions, foolish as they may have been.

Consequently, or otherwise downtrodden. I'll typically approach nonchalantly and strike up a conversation. I'll ask them specifically what it is they need; how much is enough? Sometimes it's enough for some food or cigarettes. Sometimes they don't give a reason and just specify an amount. Ten. Twenty. Other times they'll simply ask what I'm willing to give. In these instances, I'll start at fifty. “Will that be enough?” Their initial thoughts, of course, are of a suspicious nature, and are written all over their face. I quickly reassure them that there's no catch. Take it. Walk away. The pay-off is fleeting, but for whatever reason – whether it's sincere altruism, or simply a desire to be genuinely appreciated for a brief moment – I get an overwhelming sense of gratification when I hand the money to them and witness their emotions progressively evolve: suspicion – incredulity – gratitude – joyousness.


This may only happen once or twice a day, just to see her reaction.


There's no point me attempting to explicate with regard to why I do this. I don't know. It is clearly self-destructive behaviour. Those are the facts as I can best relate them. That payment last night was by no means negligible. I'm now in serious debt and I'm worried about this escalating further.


**TL;DR:** I use most of my salary giving money (hundreds, yet I still continue to do this -- including giving a random woman on the internet (who I'd only spoken to for about 20 minutes) £5000 for a car.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit I:** A bit more background: There was definitely a catalyst for this behavior which I should have perhaps included in the original post. A couple of years ago, clearly quite flustered, frantically pulling things out of her purse and fumbling with loose change. I heard the taxi driver shouting at her, being really rather abrasive and intimidating. I stopped near enough to hear their conversation pretending to light a cigarette, and on ascertaining that she couldn't pay her fare, walked over and told the driver I'd pay the full amount (not much; maybe twenty-five pounds). He drove off, and this woman, was now positively radiant. She thanked me incessantly and implored me take her phone number so she could later reimburse me

Now, it was more than that. I wanted that feeling *in perpetuity*, and since then, I've always sought out 'opportunities' of this nature. Of course, I do also try and help out people I know – family, friends, colleagues, when they're stuck –

**Edit II:** This thread has received more attention than I anticipated, I watched the film 'Shame' and it really resonated with me. For anyone who has seen it, I'm very much like Brandon, but without the nymphomania. I have that corporate, big-city kind of lifestyle, and probably appear quite normal and grounded to friends and people I work with. However, I'm actually quite reticent and private

This, but I often spend my evenings on my balcony with one of my telescopes, observing the happenings of the great city before me. From my vantage point, I have access to thousands of apartment windows, nightclub entrances, restaurants, alleyways, and I've witnessed some very interesting/disturbing/amusing things over the years. I'm fascinated by people, whilst I'm here; self-imprisoned in my Ikea-furnished cell.

EDIT: For those that are wondering what happened

We were that high-school sweetheart kind of relationship to start out with so we had this whole mentality that we would be married after school, but still present. He would tell me where I was and wasn't allowed to go, I was never invited out with him and his friends (I later found out he was thinking of seeing some girl on the side from our town, which is why I wasn't invited), I wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends or make new ones, etc. etc. Just very controlling behaviour, he literally expected me to sit at home and wait for him to come back whenever he felt like it from wherever he went I got extremely lonely. He asked me to move out

Then he stopped taking me out on dates and would make up really stupid excuses to not spend time together. My personal favorite story was when we were at the movies one time, yell at me, throw things at me, etc. I was never really scared to be honest, which I'll never understand. This only happened a handful of times (not even), but still. I fought back, although I don't know if I would recommend that idea. He would cry and plead the next day for me not to leave him

I finally had enough when I went to a mutual friends' birthday party a town over at the bar (seperately), etc. She flipped out, I flipped out, he flipped out, he drove off drunk in his vehicle and crashed it on someone's farm land. We mutually broke up the next day, however it gets creepier from there. I started hanging out with a work friend and his group of friends that I met through my roommate and he literally stalked us everywhere we went. He started ""seeing"" some single mom with 2 kids that was at least 10 years older than us; she just happened to be my boyfriend's next door neighbor. He would draw all these weird cryptic pictures and leave them stuck all over my boyfriend's windshield, tacked to his and his roommate's house, and I was legitimately starting to get freaked out at this point. Then one time we went to a party together at his friend's house and my ex randomly showed up outside the house and proceeded to graphically cut himself in front of the window crying because I wouldn't talk to him and nobody was gonna let him in obviously. Cops were called.

My ex boyfriend was always very concerned about money and also about who worked harder for what they earned. I wanted to prove a point

Somehow, but none of them seemed ""safe"" to me. The next day I returned to read some more emails to entertain myself when I stumbled across an email from a man named ""Joe"". He mentioned at some point in the email that he was in a wheelchair and also that he had limited use of his hands. He wrote very professionally and seemed very intelligent which was unlike all of the other emails I received. Also, I will admit that him being handicapped made him seem a lot safer than the others. I decided that I would do it. My ex didn't know exactly what I was planning on doing. He was glad I had accepted a second job because I was only working a four day week at the time. Joe said if he liked my cleaning he would ask me to come back weekly or bi-weekly. The extra money would help and It wasn't like I was going to sleep with him or allow him to touch me in any way. That's how I convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong.

After a few phone calls, he asked me questions and wanted me to ask him questions. After about 20 minutes of awkward conversation he shows me around his house. He had pictures of a very pretty recent ex girlfriend on his refrigerator. She was around 26 and he was 40. When we got to his bedroom he said I'd be cleaning his desk. I noticed that there were a lot of strip club MVP passes on his desk, he made a joke about them and then left to wait in the living room so I could undress. 

It didn't even feel real when I finally stood in front of him naked. He showered me with compliments and we talked as I cleaned his kitchen, I felt afraid and ashamed of myself. I thought about how devastated he would be, but it ended up just being one of Joe's friends. He let her in for a couple of minutes and I told her what he had asked me to tell her, but I doubt she believed it.

After she left, but I ended up telling my ex the truth and he wouldn't allow it.

I lied to my ex, eventually, it just became too much for him to handle and he broke up with me. I deserved it. I didn't even want to be in that relationship anymore. We had been together for so long that it just seemed too ridiculous for me to just throw it all away forever. I should have ended it the moment I knew we couldn't be happy together. Instead, I decided to lie just to amuse myself. It was a horrible and fucked up thing to do.

Let me stop and say

Back to the story. We were always chatty. Our office is small and there are 1/2 dozen employees so there was always time to get to know one another. We always shared things to each other and got real close. It was almost family-like. But we were just real good friends. Special friends is what she called it sometimes. 

During a particular tough spot at work we hardly got to talk. I was extremely busy and couldn't tear myself away that often to see how she was doing up front. She told me that she missed our chats and I agreed with her. So

But see, and give it to her. It was primal.

Also, I think it made it even more desirable. Just to have this much older lady want to throw it back at me like she's never done before. It made my stomach ache sometimes. I would take it out on my wife in the bedroom sometimes and feel so ashamed after. I mean, screwing my lovely wife while thinking about banging this old, conservative broad back at work. My head would spin.

She always wore slacks to work. Her bottom was round and big. But it was shaped just right and her slacks would stretch perfectly over it - hugging it like I wanted to do. My fantasies would mostly end with her begging me to get behind her and fuck her like mad. I still have those fantasies.

One particular day I got fed up. Or I should say,"" she replied.

Then I told her how much she turned me on. How attractive I thought she was. Her body. Her fragrance. Right down to her fingernail polish. And I waited for what seemed like an hour for a reply. She told me how much that meant to her and that she was flattered. And how good looking she thought I was too.

No. No. No. I sent something back even more juicy. I told her about my fantasies with her. Everything. I mean

She texted me that what I wrote made her ""wet"" just reading it. My heart thumped in my chest. I felt like a kid getting a love note in school - but much more than just ""Do you love me?"" This was a ""Do you want to see my panties!"" note.

From that point on we texted the filthiest

Work was slowing down so our texting went up. We were pretty discreet and tried to be as careful as possible. Sometimes we'd almost get caught if someone came in and a text would pop up. We had codes for people walking the halls and people behind out backs and such so we tried to keep it hidden. 

The secretiveness of it made us even more horny. One time I was writing code for a backup program on one of our servers and was texting her with another computer. I told her I couldn't handle having an erection all day again because this time it was bigger than ever. She told me to prove it. The rest of the staff was in the conference room so I told her to come to the server room and I'd show her. I heard her walk down the hall. When she came in I stood up and pressed my jeans across my erection to show her. Her hand made a b-line directly to it and slid across my pecker - over the jeans. ""Mmmm. Hate to see that go to waste."" I almost lost it. The world emptied and it felt like we were standing alone in space. But I had to shake the feeling and get back to work.

A few days later she decided to come in early. I was already there getting computers going and checking systems like every day. At the time I was in my office and she waltzed straight up to me and started kissing me with eagerness. I kissed back like she was a lost love from years past. My dick stood straight up. Quick. It surprised me. I mean, sat down, and pulled it out. Fuck it, I thought. ""Hey. See what you've done?"" She turned and looked. Her hand was on it. I can still feel it now. Slightly cold, but soft. Her rings. The way she slid her hand all the way up over the head and let go. Then she walked out.

A second or so later, but the mention of her husband sort of killed it. 

From that point we fondled a lot with each other. She let me suck on her nipples from time to time and rub her beautiful ass. Every so often I would rub her clit or stick my finger in her. Then one day we found out the rest of the office was going to be out of town. We talked about what we could do and couldn't do. ""NO Penetration.""

(I have to hurry up here. I'm getting horny thinking about it again. We're still working together but trying to stay clear of what happened.)

The day before everyone was going to be gone

Uh ... nope. I guess porn ruined me because for whatever reason her pussy looked nothing like I expected. It was beautiful. So pink. So wonderful. I wanted to drop to my knees and bury my tongue in it. I was also half scared out of my mind. Here she is, and actually playing with the petals right here in our office. What kind of wonderfully crazy woman is this? I was so wrought with confusion my dick didn't know what to do.

(oops. she just walked in.) (m'kay)

Anyway. Several times that day I asked to see it and she obliged. It was like she was trying to get me ready for the next day. Even now

Some of you may be hoping that I got my wish - that I fucked her so righteously on her desk that it was like a movie. That's not what happened. God, my kids, her husband, our employees, my pastor. It was movie-like. A very bad movie about doing the right thing.

But she grabbed my pecker and slid the head of it up and down her lips. I acted as best as I could and went for her breasts - nibbling and sucking away half-heartily. It was right there every time I looked down. Right there about to go in. But I didn't want it to. Not now. So I had to try and stop it. I made some wild lie about how I had to cum just touching her and she told me she wanted to finish me off in the bathroom. So we walked up the hall and she grabbed my dick and started wanking it. It was nice actually. Her hands were soft. He motion was just right. In no time flat I came like a wild cat. Then regret hit me. Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuu.

And since then I've been battling with regret and need. I regret that we let it get that far but I need to go further. I want to go further. I want to eat her pussy like it's never been eaten. I want to make love to her like no other. I want to fuck her like no other. I want to do terrible things to her. But it's never going to happen.  She regrets it too. Many times now she tells me that it will never happen again. We cannot even text like we used to.

Good. I guess. Yeah

More than likely though

tl;dr (You really should read it if you have the time. It took me a while to write.)

**edit: I do want to state again that what I did was wrong. I'm not bragging about the situation. And it did happen. A lot of stuff was left out too because I didn't have the time to type it all out. On the ride home last night guilt overwhelmed me. I felt a lot of shame because the first step I took toward her was a step I should have never taken.**

1341791175.0,w8r1z,I haven't showered in approx 1.5 years. I don't smell and no one except my girlfriend knows. ,hasntshoweredin2012,268,69,232,"Background: I'm prone to mild to severe eczema all over my body and flare ups most often occur after taking showers. I suffered for years with constant out-breaks and dry itchy skin. I say this in retrospect because I never fully appreciated the connection between my eczema and showering until I stopped taking showers.

I stopped showering about 1.5 years ago after a long holiday break when I didn't take a shower for a week. I noticed that my eczema had cleared up considerably and my skin wasn't dry anymore. I couldn't bare the thought of taking a shower and having that dry itchy skin again so I decided to just keep the experiment going.

Here has been my experience so far. Within the first 12 hours or so of taking my last shower

Amazingly, but my girlfriend confirmed that I smelled fine. And I made extra sure by having her stick her nose right up arm pits, my balls, taint, my ass, everywhere. But still, no bad smells. 

That's not to say I don't smell like anything, my girlfriend likes the smell. She cups my balls when we spoon at night and can sometimes faintly smell my balls on her fingers during the day. She enjoys it.

But despite not showering I still follow some basic hygiene. I occasionally (once a month or so) take a wet face cloth and give my crotch area a quick wipe down, but I do it because I don't want others to know that I don't shower because of the obvious social stigma against it. I'll also give my ass crack a quick wipe while I'm at it because that's where shit comes out of and you'll want to clear out any left over debris that builds up periodically. 

That's all the washing I do. Occasionally, but just a small amount and only to prevent sweating and soaking the arm pits of my t-shirts. I always ask my girlfriend to double check if I smell every time before we go out anywhere... she sticks her nose everywhere and every time no bad smells. No one else thinks I smell either (I've indirectly asked several people without saying I don't shower). 

My totally un-researched theory is that whatever bacteria builds back up when you initially wash it all away in the shower is the bacteria that smells like like bad B.O. I think the subsequent bacteria that builds up over the course of several days neutralizes the smell and that's when your skin is balanced and not dried out

So there you have it. In my experience and opinion, it made me realize that back before soap and daily showering, people probably smelled fine, despite the popular belief that everyone stunk. It also made me realize that that person you sometimes run across who stinks like horrible B.O. probably just took a shower and forgot deodorant. 

TLDR: I have eczema that got bad in the shower, just a crotchy smell. My girlfriend likes the smell of my crotch on her fingers in the morning too so it's win/win. No one else knows.

Edit: I should add a few things. I'm thin and keep my hair extremely short. I also don't have a ton of body hair. These factors might influence my outcome to a certain degree.

Edit/Update: Thanks for all the positive feedback everyone. The no shower movement is finally taking shape. As for my detractors, the dirt and sweat isn't staying on my body. I just don't need hundreds of gallons of water per month just to stay clean, that's all. 

So if you think I'm walking around smelling, my head is clean. I don't smell, I promise you. I have an attractive girlfriend and a good job. Trust me, if I smelled I'd know by now.

Also, the bad odors go away. If you don't believe me, you'll just have to try it out for yourselves. But remember, this all assumes that you're maintaining basic hygiene such as wiping your ass, brushing your teeth and wearing clean clothes. If you're covered in shit and piss all the time of course you're going to smell, shower or not.

1346600728.0,z8ecw,When I was in highschool I used to anonymously send naked pictures of myself to boys I liked (and some teachers too),ella1993,337,139,143,"I just have to say this somewhere. Recently I had to visit home and I ended up hanging out with several people I hadn't seen since graduating highschool. After a few drinks one of the guys asked if we remembered the ""child porn incident"" from back during our junior year. Of course we all remembered. The guy then said ""Man I wish we would have found out who that was. She had great tits!"". That's when my ""friend"" (I never really liked this girl and frankly I don't know how she got invited to this reunion of ours) suddenly declared that it had been her.

Everyone believed her. Boy did that make me angry! I didn't say anything out of embarrassment but obviously I knew she hadn't sent those pictures. Because I was the one who did.

See during my freshman year I was sort of starved for attention. Without going into too much detail I'll just say that I was a pretty typical adolescent girl: I didn't think I was pretty enough, for some reason, I decided to take some naked pictures of myself.

To my surprise I was actually pleased with how they turned out. I looked pretty damned sexy, and I'll never know how this idea popped into my head, I ended up printing six copies of my favorite (one that showed me from the neck to my thighs).

The next day at school I slipped the pictures into the lockers of six different guys I sort of had crushes on. I don't know what I expected would happen but it gave me this wild thrill to imagine them seeing my naked body. I never heard anything about that batch but just imagining those boy's reactions to the pictures made me want to do it again.

So I did but this time I mailed the pictures. I actually rode my bike across town and used a public mailbox because I was afraid they'd be traced back to me. The other difference was that I included three separate pictures this time in each envelope and expanded my list of recipients to eight boys and two male teachers. 

I did this once in a while up until my junior year. Sometimes I would write little messages on my body with lipstick

Eventually I sent pictures to the wrong person: a boy whose mother opened up his mail for him. She made a huge deal about it and I'll never forget when an ""emergency assembly"" was called and there were sheriff deputies in the gym alongside some very serious-looking people. Our whole school was lectured about child pornography and how whoever was sending out these pictures was committing a serious felony. We were all urged to come forward if we had any information about them. 

Apparently the pictures had been reported before but nothing had been done about them until this one particular mother made a huge stink. At least that's what I heard-- there were so many rumors surrounding this ""controversy""! Like, it was just a bunch of adults trying to scare everyone into not trading naked pictures online. On and on the rumors went..

And honestly?? I enjoyed it. Sure I was anxious as heck at first that I'd be discovered somehow but I admit that I really liked the ""attention"" I was receiving. Hearing guys who I knew had actually seen the pictures brag about it was a huge turn-on. Heck

Now all these years later this bitch claims that she was the one in the pictures. Yeah right. She was barely an A-cup before getting pregnant right after graduation.

he left me in the living room to go take a shower and do laundry, i felt out of place. NOT GOOD. about 25 minutes later he came back in, told me he was sorry about everything and then he gave me a letter with my name on it. i guess it's a letter, i haven't opened it yet

he took a melatonin and told me not to open the envelope until i was away from him. he sat down beside me

i didnt say anything for awhile. i finally decided to leave, etc. he took hold of my hand and gave me a quick peck on the cheek as he had done before, told me sweet dreams, then went to bed.

My entire future flashed before my eyes, responsibility, and a girl who I'd only wanted as a FWB was now going to be a major part of the rest of my life. 

I asked her what she wanted to do, trying to sugarcoat what I was going to say, but finally I blurted out that I didn't want to be a dad or be with her. She started to cry, got angry, and stormed out saying that if I didn't want to raise it that was fine and that she'd do it on her own. 

I didn't sleep that night. I just kept thinking about how even though I eventually wanted kids I didn't want to do it like this and especially not with her. Even if she absolved me of all responsibility I didn't think I could live knowing my kid was out there. I had to do something. So I went over to her apartment the next day

2. She could have the baby but I would find the most expensive lawyer I could and sue for full custody which I would undoubtedly get considering she was unemployed

I hate it when people try to guilt the suicidal into staying alive by telling them how much their loved ones will be hurt. These same people also tend to call the suicidal selfish, and perhaps it is selfish, but no more selfish than loved ones wanting to keep a suicidal person alive just because other people will be negatively affected, never mind that it just prolongs the suicidal person's suffering.

Sure, may eventually find fulfilment in life, but then again, maybe that person won't. Either way, it doesn't matter to me; I am a firm believer in autonomy. In my opinion, every person ought to be able to do with him- or herself whatever s/he wishes.

My father suffered from depression his entire life, I guess. He'd been suicidal before, but never did anything because the family kept guilting him out of it. Still, no matter how many medications he tried and therapy sessions he attended, he wasn't happy. Killing himself was the only way he felt he could find peace and comfort. At first, I felt the same way my family felt about his death: devastated. But then, my dad was devastated his entire life

As for my uncle, I still believe it is his right to do with his body whatever he wishes. And hell, nobody knows exactly what he was thinking and feeling at that moment. All I know is that he was in so much agony he felt that the only way out of it was through death.

Nor can I understand exactly what any other suicidal person is going through in his or her head. No matter the situation, then perhaps that might be the best thing for that person. Maybe not. I don't know. Either way, it isn't my decision--or anyone else's, for that matter--to decide.

I'm not saying my logic is infallible, even if other people disagree with it, and even if it turns out not to be the best choice. Still, sometimes I really think it might be. Like for my dad.

I have worked for this company for 12 years and I loved my job. I worked with people with developmental disabilities and I adore all of them. For the most part my company was good to me but paid poorly. Raises became a thing of the past but a few promotions and a husband working more than full time made raising 4 Beautiful children doable. About 3 years ago my husband almost died from 3 months of pneumonia which resulted in an empiema that collapsed his lung. Surgery was successful but we didnt have insurance. We also began to have other huge financial blows during the collapse of the housing market. Eventually we sought financial counselling and were advised to file for bankruptcy. Unfortunately we hired a bad lawyer who took our money and did nothing. In the end we lost out home and had 2 weeks to find a place to rent. The only place available was a way over priced slum that was infested with roaches and had no heat or air. We had no choice but to take it. Shortly after my husbands hours were cut and we were both garnished. We ended up evicted with a week to move. On top of losing two homes we lost our cars. We managed to finally get some assistance with food but it lasted for two weeks. Two weeks we barely had food. We managed to find a better place to live in a small trailer park but moving expenses were very expensive and honestly impossible for us. 
My husband was out of work. I had no options and I had to take care of my kids. This is where the felony comes in.
I was responsible for the funds for a group of the people we supported. Though the company was responsible for auditing these funds it rarely ever happened. I had full access to this money and it was never used fully. We were responsible to keep the funds under a certain amount and that was difficult to do. I made a decision I never would have made under normal circumstances to borrow some of it to feed my family. At first it was amounts I would easily pay back within the month. But then more financial blows occurred when the assistance we were approved for to cover out 2nd months rent didnt come through and we spent our money on other bills and werent prepared for rent on top of it. We were short $250 and nobody was able to help. I had reluctantly borrowed money to cover it from the clients to cover rent and our needs until I got paid. I tried to cash out vacation time to pay it back but it wasnt approved until 2 weeks later and only got half of it. We were behind on everything and were paying back people we borrowed from every week and barely had money for anything. We needed food and gas was crazy. Our broken down car Finally broke beyond our ability to afford the fix. I had to pay for rides to work and back and to town once or twice a week to get what we needed to live. My check wasnt covering the bills and the added expenses. I ended up borrowing to pay rent again and exhausted the funds. Each paycheck I paid back what I could and covered their weekly expenses but wasnt prepared for the extra money their caregivers started asking for. I tried to put them off while I requested extra funds from their accounts. One caregiver became upset and went to my boss. I guess this sparked suspicion and they decided to investigate. In the end they found that over $2000 was unaccounted for. More in comments.

A few weeks ago, Rob, decided he wanted to come with us back to Tina's dorm. Tina and I agreed that it would be fine, even though we both agreed that Rob was a bit creepy, if not a complete psychopath.

While we were at Tinas place, talking about a ""six week dry spell"" or some bullshit. We went with it, just to make him shut his damn mouth.

Tina poured us all some soda, I'm not so sure. 

I got dared to play strip poker. 

I rolled with it.

My friend knew how to count cards apparently (she did not tell me this at the time)

I lost. Miserably.

I felt really uncomfortable, due to the fact that they were incredibly underdeveloped, and felt very vulnerable, but I was scared to say anything because these guys were the only people in town that I felt really cared about me, and weren't annoyed by me. 

Anyways

I went with it, and of Rob, because the dude does not exactly have all his screws in.

Tina watched. She ""enjoyed"" herself. She offered to get a camera, and attempt to wriggle out of his grasp, or try to get the game back onto more wholesome tracks, but every time I said something that Rob didn't like, tried to derail whatever track he was on, he'd just do something to make my brain shut off again.

After a while, but she just told me to go with him.

I agreed, we'll just make out, then he'll leave me alone, please god let him leave me alone,"" and partially because the idea of staying in the same room as a girl that had just jilled it to me getting molested made me feel ill.

As we were leaving Tina's apartment, and I heard him mutter ""You fucking rock, thanks!"" to her.

The entire walk back to his place

We went to his place, One minute he was doing one thing, the next he decided he was going to break the no sex rule.

The bastard wasn't even wearing a condom.

I started crying

I felt myself getting torn apart

He got off three times

He made me suck him off after he fucked me. I can still taste the blood.

I got sick the next morning. He held my hair back, I'm a right natural at this, that we should do it again some time.

Tina came and picked me up because Rob called her

I went home and collapsed into bed. I felt exhausted. I woke up two hours later, ran to the shower, and scrubbed for so long my skin started to bleed. 

The pants I had worn on the ride back to my dorm were ruined. Rob had decided to keep my underwear

The next day, she sneered but told me that she was ""here for me if I needed to talk.""

I haven't seen Tina or Rob for the past few weeks

I haven't gone a day without vomiting or getting diarrhea. I've been picking my skin and my hair has been falling out. I can't sleep, or I'm back with Rob and he is fucking me in front of the entire campus, and I always wake up sobbing. I've been dropping weight like crazy, and I can't go out in public without being scared. I haven't stopped bleeding, part of me thinks I might have torn something from my surgery.

I'm not a sexual being. I didn't want to have sex yet. Let alone with him. It seems ridiculous, it's been a lot, I wanted my first to be someone I thought of as a future husband. Not some psychopath from my Humans vs Zombies club. Until that night, I hadn't even been kissed. I've never gone out on a date. Hell, I haven't really ever even masturbated.

My current semi girl friend has fucked over a hundred men, whored her self out regularly until she decided to stop for other reasons (safety).  When I do down on her, I nearly cum thinking about all the men who have fucked her, or kissing her thinking about all the men whose cum she has swallowed.  Yea, strippers and porn actresses.

It not just the sluttiness.  When a girl tells me she is into animals, I just want her.  When she has no limits and is ready to do anything.. wow.

So here is the thing.  It's not a sexual attraction I feel

I've been live-in dating the same girl for 7 years now.  The last couple of years

On the trip, I carried her onto the plane when our ""vacation"" was over.  I've been every step of the way the ""perfect"" guy.  Every one of my friends, and her friends and our respective families keep telling me how PROUD they are of how much I've stepped up to help her.

For the first several months of this, did her laundry, cleaned the entire house, took care of our pets, bought her a laptop so she could still communicate with people online.   Honestly, my concern for her made our relationship feel whole again... for awhile.

It's now been 8 months since the accident.  She's still in pain sometimes, and talk to her friends online.

I've returned to my old ways, nor have we (minus one occasion) for at least 2 years - due to non-interest - not the injuries.  We have no interesting conversations anymore, as her life revolves around her injuries.  

I want to leave, none of her friends make enough money to support her.

*edit to add* She spends about 4 hours a day in physical therapy now (which I'm paying for). She's working very hard to get better

I've secretly begun to hate being around her

**FINAL COMMENTS** *Thanks everyone for allowing me to get this off my chest, and I don't feel I've done anything especially brave or noble.  Just because I pulled her out of the wreck, and went to get help she feels I saved her life.  She's told everyone this.  She's forgotten the trip was my idea.  She's forgotten that she wanted to cancel the trip last minute, and she's forgotten that the day of the wreck everything we did was my plan. I feel entirely responsible for her condition so my helping is only to rid myself of that guilt, in preparation for what will be the end.  I do not know when it will end, but it will.  Thank you for allowing me to vent.  It helps more than you know.*",,,,

I'm 36, had two kids, recovering from major surgery and *still* in better shape than him!) If I'm such a dead weight around his neck why does he get all jealous when I talk to my male friends?

Our eleven year old daughter just hit puberty and is going through some stuff. Normal girl stuff, calling her crazy, stupid, hysterical, saying she inherited my ""bitch genes.""

He expects her to still fawn on him and be daddy's girl. Well, and that's what tipped me off.

I am getting all my ducks in a row. I've opened an account he doesn't know aboout and have started transfering funds. I'm talking to a lawyer tomorrow. The kids and I are going to visit my parents in their country next month (he can't come because he has to ""work""). Ideally I'll serve him with the papers while we're there and we'll just stay there. But i have to see what the lawyer says.

**Edit:**

I just want to clarify that I'm not moving the money to hide it or punish him. He's burning through his own money like there's no tomorrow and I don't want him to clear out our savings next. All my pay is going into my new account too for the same reason. I'm not going to hide it from the lawyers

Confession is a niche reddit. It has one purpose. Confession is the acknowledgment of sin or wrongdoing or transgressions. It's about clearing your conscience, in ""What is Confession"", also posted below). 

&gt; **What is Confession?**

&gt; * a formal admission of one's sins with repentance and desire of absolution.

&gt; * a formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime.

&gt; * an admission or acknowledgment that one has done something that one is ashamed or embarrassed about.

So if you submitted something recently and it didn't make it to the frontpage, it would be more fitting there and likely get a better reception there.

---------

**What r/confession is not:** 

* r/confession is NOT a place to dole out judgment and abuse. Some things that people confess to are pretty bad

&gt; **We are not here to judge others.**
 
&gt; **No personal attacks

But what about people who take advantage of the atmosphere of non-judgment to brag about bad things they've done? 

* **/r/confession is NOT a place for bragging about bad behavior either.** There are a ton of other subreddits out there for it

* No meta posts. Update posts by people who previously posted a confession are fine (make sure to link to the original in the text of the update). 

-----------

This is also a good time to mention several other similar reddits that provide a valuable place for specific situations and needs.

* /r/IAmA, have people ask you about yourself.

Growing up, adults would always tell me that when girls have sex, they become attached, so we need to be careful. I was told that men would want to use me, while I'd want something more. So, when I discovered that a lot of the time, I wanted to have sex with people, I assumed I must be emotionally broken.

At this point

There's nothing I love more than going out, even if it's as subtle as a hand on the small of my back. It makes me shiver. The closer he gets, the more electric I feel. I love the first kiss, the taste of somebody new. I love the way he'll grab me and I'll feel so small in his arms. I love fervently making out until he's kissing my neck and taking off my clothes. I love getting lost in that animalistic passion.

I've found that unless I am actually *dating* someone

I have safe sex. I don't sleep with absolute strangers, before I'll ""allow"" him to have sex with me. I'm not *rewarding* him for anything -- I *also want sex*. All I demand is general human respect, same as I want from anyone I spend time around. I would never sleep with a man in a relationship that I was privy to. On numerous occasions, when I've been made aware that a man I'm interested in sleeping with is object of affection for somebody else, I move on. I refuse to ""compete"" with other women in any way.

And yet, or how much respect I try to have for others and myself, if I enjoy casual sex, I will be called a slut. And why? What's the problem? I have a few friends who think casual sex is fine, but the vast majority of people in my life think that women that ""sleep around"" are either 1. Girls with ""daddy issues,"" or 2. Morally-repugnant temptress harlots. Since I have no ""daddy issues"" and suffer no emotional repercussions from willingly engaging in casual sex ... then I must be the second.

Somehow I found myself in an extremely psychologically/emotionally abusive relationship when I as 17 with someone who had an explosive and violent personality.  It was my first relationship, and if there was even a question of me choosing someone else over him, I would pay the price. I just didn't have the tools mentally to know how to handle this at the time, so I would just always do my best to carefully not poke the bear.

He tried to have sex with me pretty soon into the relationship. I was a virgin and had wanted to stay that way, he would get angry. Eventually anger gave way to violence.  So I ended up caving out of fear of what would happen if I didn't. It was horrible.

Once I gave in, so I would just do it. And I hated myself for it. Afterward he would usually pass out from whatever drug he was on and I would end up locking myself in his bathroom, curled up in the corner crying. Sometimes it would be particularly horrible and crying wouldn't be enough to calm down, and I would just sit there and punch my thighs over and over to get my frustration out.

1355042322.0,14ji1s,My boyfriend's put on weight and it has really turned me on and I have been subtly encouraging him,throwaway_867530,227,51,114,"He said he's put on ~30 pounds in the last year. FWIW, but a tallish guy. He's grown out of some of his clothes, even his chest is softening up. In comparison to what he looked like before (~150 pounds on that frame) of course he looks fat

I realized I started finding this to be very attractive because now I get obsessed about what he eats. I have stuff around the apartment, but he never commits. He says he's getting fat, he said he's never been this heavy, always calls himself a fatty (and other various words), that he's gonna lose weight, he's gonna eat less, etc., though.

But when he does make these comments.. eating less food or something.. it upsets me. For one, that he's normal, that guys with meat on them is nice, and so on, but am I doing more harm than good by saying that??

I know I'm being selfish by wanting him a way he might not be happy with. But I am so, we have more intense sex. It's.. everything about his growing body that drives me wild. I love his weight pressing down on me, and his belly sagging when he's on top. I love grabbing a handful of flesh when we've having sex, and seeing that big round hairy mountain when I look up at him when I'm giving him a BJ. He has an actual ass. Just the sight of his boxers folding under his gut or seeing him try on clothes that are now too small for him.. I'm turned on just thinking about it.

I know my obsession is getting into dangerous territory when I start getting mad. It's not my place to be mad if he wants to less eat or drink fewer sodas. I tell him he's gorgeous and perfect. I want to tell him, but I'm dealing with the internal argument of how to tell him this. I want to admit to him, but I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll think I've been up to something to no good this whole time, when it's mostly just me appreciating his body. He seems so much happier and content and less prone to mood swings since he's put on weight and eaten food regularly (instead of forgetting to eat for half a day when he was in school), but maybe I'm making a false argument for causation equals correlation.

Always thought my sister was normal. Found out I was wrong when I was about 14

See

As a hormonal fourteen year old I found it exciting to snoop around her bedroom sometimes. Yes I enjoyed going through her underwear drawer but it wasn't because I wanted to fuck her

There were no drugs but underneath a stack of old celebrity gossip magazines I found two vibrators, hand cuffs, and a hardcover book-journal thing. Page one was dated two years earlier (when she was 15) and written in her handwriting it described losing her virginity to the boyfriend she was still seeing at that time. In great detail she talked about giving her first blowjob and then letting him ""stick it in just to see what it felt like"". It went on to talk about how great it felt and how much she loved her boyfriend.

This alone blew my mind. Figured she wasn't a virgin but to read about how it went down was amazing. Then I realized that every page of the mostly filled up journal was an entry like this and guess what? They weren't only about her boyfriend. On the first page I got to that made me realize this she explained how she felt guilty but she had cheated on him. After that every page was the same: nothing more about her boyfriend (remember: she was still with him at the time and they'd been dating for years!). Just other guys and her rationalizing her cheating. She described some crazy sex she was having in detail with other guys

Until she moved to college I used to look at that diary of hers every chance I got. I would always check first to see if she'd added anything new and if there wasn't I'd just find one of her better previous entries and yeah

Fuck.

You know it totally changed the way I saw her. I had known before that she was pretty good looking but now I saw her as a sex object. Everyone on reddit jokes about incest but I seriously became obsessed with the idea. Read tons about it: fiction

So fucking stupid. I tried thinking of any way I could hint to her that i wanted to fuck her but thank god I never went through with any of horrible ideas. Well

Nothing happened. Turned out she was just using some tumbler thing for a school project. Felt like an idiot because I had no idea what to tell her to explain why I'd just barged in on her room like that. It doesn't sound like a lot I know but trust me that moment was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. Her giving me a ""what the hell are you doing?"" look and me realizing I had actually tried breaking through the fantasy into reality. What a god damn asshole.

Never tried any of that shit again. I did something else though. Last year when she was visiting from college for the holidays she asked me to look at her laptop for her because it'd been acting up. After removing a bunch of malware for her I installed a keylogger program. Next day I had all of her passwords and account names. And yeah

The tally of the number of guys she'd been with was already 17 before she left for college. Based on the things I've learned from my cyber spying since I'd guess that number is at least three times greater. I know this behavior of hers is self destructive especially since in one e mail she sent to a friend she wrote about a ""hookup"" that sounded more like rape to me. Hell even her friend agreed and advised her to call the cops. My sister never responded to that e mail.

Fuck. She's doing decent at college I guess and should graduate next year and it's not like she's gotten pregnant or anything but I feel guilty every fucking day because I know that a good brother would confront her about this stuff. She has a coward for a brother though. I try to tell myself that I can't do it because there's no way to explain how I know what I've found and all the spying I've done these past few years but you want to know what the truth is?

I like the fact that my sister's such a slut. I like jerking off thinking about her. I love the thrill of seeing her photos and whenever a new one shows up in her e mail account (which is rare) I feel like I've won the lottery. Most of all I like reading her sex chats and e mails and getting into her head and learning all of her secrets. Imagining her doing these things and wishing she made videos.

I asked him about this and he said most pedophiles did not want to hurt kids, maybe once a week. When I turned 15 he sat down and told me that I shouldn't ""rely on him"" for sexual relief, and that I should venture out with others that were more my age. After that, we just stopped.

We talked about kinks, I loved knowing a man I had never met wanted to fuck me.
We met on the 19th of June, and silently went to the hotel room. 
As soon as we got in he was all over me, not knowing where to start, I had never kissed before so everything was scarily new.
He must of noticed my reluctance, for which I never thanked him for.
We had sex 3-4 times, tie me to a chair in the room with bondage tape and lick me out.
In the morning, just a smile and a nod. I didn't want anything more, I got what I came for. I went home and reminisced, I was ashamed about what i did, but at the same time was thankful for it, I felt that I was desirable to someone out there, and not just the funny girl with the friendly face and average body.

I hope you can forgive the throwaway. Here's what happened. I became stepdad of this girl when she was barely 7, and tended to escape in porn/sex. I gradually found myself thinking about my stepdaughter sexually for a period of time. Damn that sounds horrible. But there's no other way to put it. I didn't do anything to act on this except for one evening we were watching TV alone and she asked for a massage, and I gave her one that to me felt pretty sensual. I didn't touch her private parts or anything, but I did convince her I needed to massage her back and upper rear end beneath her clothing (her shirt/bra, and pants a few inches below her waistline). I was aroused, but I don't know how evident it was. I stopped after a while and nothing was said. Just finished our show, went to bed. The next several days I felt indescribably awful. Finally I decided to talk to her and try to give her a plausible way to tell herself nothing bad happened. I said I wasn't thinking about how grown up she'd become and that it was actually not ok for a male to massage her like that anymore, and I was just being oblivious and thinking of her as a small child and I was sorry. I don't know if she bought this or not. 

I've never done anything like this since, unless that's just in my head personally. I know I fucked up, but I really need some perspective. I tend to either feel like I've ruined her life and deserve to die, or tell myself it didn't do any harm, with no in between. Can you help me see whether this is something I should just leave alone, because she might have just missed the whole sexual side of it? Or is it something I need to be accountable for in some further way? She's totally messed up now at 19, and I think it's probably my fault. I don't know how to fix this. I want to fix it but I don't know how. Should I bring it up again and acknowledge what really happened on my end so she can get closure if she is tormented by it? I don't know what to think. Am I going to go to jail? Should I go to jail? I know I'll get some ""go kill yourself"" responses, or people who can help me see reason and morality and what to do

 Looking back the first sign that anything was different was [this](http://www.neozaa.com/playgame.php?id=547) game. The girls weren't anything unusual, but it was around 8th grade so I think that's to be expected. We dated for a month or two and she was my first kiss and the first boob I ever felt. It got weird when my best friend *also* started fooling around with her. We'd each take a boob, or she'd get off on webcam for both of us and it honestly felt fine until she started expressing a preference for him over me. That's when it really started. I didn't like the idea that there were pictures of her out there that I *hadn't seen*, so I started sneaking onto his computer to snag any pictures of her that were there. The habit should have stopped with her, but it didn't. My friend got more and more popular and more and more girls would send him nudes and I would sneak in, grab them, and sneak out. I got a rush from seeing things that I know I shouldn't.

My little habit has since grown into a compulsion

Whenever I know that a piece of information exists now, SSN's, you name it. What's weird is that I don't enjoy seeing the information itself as I do just *sorting* it all. I have neat little folders with names and information and it grows every single day. Sure, I still get off to the pictures, but knowing that I found something that someone tried to hide is such a rush. It's become so much more about the game and so much less about the prize. I never *do* anything with the information I get. I've never even thought about identity theft or blackmail, I just enjoy the detective work.

I know that what I'm doing is wrong on so many levels, I just have this absolute *compulsion* to find what people have tried to hide.

I'll be giving it all up in two months when I'll be moving in with my girlfriend. I'll put it on a hard drive with every type of security I can think of and throw it into storage.

Well tonight I got onto Craigslist looking for a guy to hook up with. I've been in that kind of mood lately

I don't know why

He was so fresh faced and obviously nervous. I felt like the most perverted, and how he wants to come out to her but knows she'll ridicule him for being gay, maybe worse. The entire time I just kept thinking about how I would feel if this were my own son being taken advantage of by some horny old pervert. 

Even worse, but I continued. The whole time, he kept apologizing to me for being too tight and not being ""ready right away."" 

When it was over

He's still sleeping in my bed but I can't be there with him right now. I truly feel like I became a monster tonight

1369359769.0,1exzxe,My childhood friend was in a CP video.,stranger--danger,212,53,54,"Note: I am/was a bad person

Years back, and traded on now defunct IRC channels.

In my 8th grade year, jerking it like the horny teenager that I was, I looked at the boy's face. He was my classmate from my earth sciences class. His asshole was being stretched by his father's cock, while he lay there motionless. I was so certain it was him--the *star* just had the same facial structure and mannerisms of my classmate.

The next school day, from what I've thought. I always imagined that the children ""stars"" would act differently--abused and neglected, or withdrawn. He was just normal. Because of this, I doubted myself. I had no proof it were actually him, it may have just been a very similar look-a-like.

Throughout high school, we exchanged our Steam names and gamed together. I still had a thought that it were him in the video, but still I didn't feel confident enough to ask (would it be a faux pas to ask if someone was a child porn star?). 

Graduation came. We were graduation partners. We walked up to the stage, he saw his. He motioned to me to come over and talk; that's when I discovered it. It was indeed him. His father with the same beard, and almost the hairstyle stood there. Him standing next to his father was an almost perfect depiction of the video's thumbnail. 

I was somewhat disturbed, working a fulltime job to cover tuition. We still talk daily.

**Update 2013/05/25**: I'm too tired/lazy to reply to everyone's comments.

I'm going to first talk to him about it. I'm going to visit ""his area"" in about 2 weeks to talk to a transfer advisor. I was thinking about just dropping by and getting lunch with him. I thought about the possible repercussions about waiting and I decided that it would be better to see how he would like to proceed: if he wanted to do it himself or if I ought to tell. I did happen to find a state trooper's email who seems like somebody that would be able to help (I will probably be using an anonymous email). After we talk, and the state can file charges).

Well, I walked away from my healthy lifestyle too.

Just in a few short months I have slept with many women. Some I just met that evening. I started using coke and uppers to keep me going. I don't sleep. I eat like shit. I don't train anymore. I feel like hell and I need to get back on track.

Tonight might have been it for me. I woke up with a girl I just met. We snorted coke until midnight, I almost started crying.  Since i got home, I have been crying and severely depressed.

The thing is the reason my wife had her affair was one of the same reasons. She met an old boyfriend online and started hanging out and doing drugs together. Since it wasn't what I wanted out of her she did it all behind my back and got hooked with him and what she was doing.

Now I'm probably worse off than her. My life restarts now.

**Edit:**  I just want to say that you guys are fucking incredible. I planned my week out and what I'm going to do with getting back into training. I'm looking forward to this slow trek back. 

**Edit 2:** Sick as hell last night but I still got up and did my morning workout. Going to hit the gym tonight to do a little cardio and core. I hope I can ease into this all week and make it a habit like it once was. Cutting everything off completely is the only way I can do things. Either I'm all in or all out

**Edit 3:** I'm still going to bed early and getting up to train. I do have a hard time falling asleep

**Edit 4:** Still going. I couldn't train this morning because I had to keep my little girl. But that was worth not doing it. I am still clean though. I haven't even had a beer since Saturday. And that's tough living in a home with another single guy and having a fridge stocked with it. Last night I bought a huge pack of waters and filled the fridge with that to help keep me focused when I open it.

Not only do they not discipline him, not allowed to tell him no, not allowed to anything, really.

My mom used to babysit for them all the time but stopped because they tore her a new one for scolding him when he was harassing the cat. I'd like to point out that the cat

So now they have to pay for daycare

I know how they raise their kid is none of my business so I stay entirely out of it. I smile and nod when they bring up the kid and change the subject. But they've started to notice that I'm different with little ""Damien"" than I was with my other nieces and nephews. 

With the rest of them I was always happy to babysit them, museums, parks, take an interest in their interests, and generally try to be the best aunt ever. Because they're genuinely good people, these kids, and I love the shit out of them. I would lay down my life in a heartbeat for every one of them.

But since Damien has been old enough to start screaming and punching I've been avoiding babysitting him at all costs. I know

Fuck that. I'm not advocating kicking the shit out of kids over trivialities. I'm talking about giving a kid a time out because he got jealous of his younger cousin and started beating her over the head with a wooden block. If I can't do that

None of my other siblings mind if I tell their kid off for acting up. In fact

And I would like to be the fun aunt to Damien too. But as long as my brother and SIL keep being the way they're being

How two such formerly intelligent people lost all their common sense as soon as they bred I'll never know. But I do know that their behavior

Ever since I was around four my sister has had serious issues. She was seven going on  sixteen. She would scream that she hated my parents. She would break rules and get sent to her room

Sometimes she would pack up a bag and claim she was going to run away. But that wasn't the worst. She would open the bathroom window and claim to jump out. She would stare through the open window at the ground screaming that she would do it. I was four

This continued for years. We knew she had problems but at this time she refused to get help. She fell in to a bit of a ditch. We lived in a suburb of Chicago that is known for having

One day me and my dad were out (I was about 12 at the time) he was getting a new bike and we were stopping to eat at Wendy's. My dad got a call. I remember him saying ""Well you can suspect it but until you have evidence you can't really say anything."" She had been caught smoking weed. My parents raided her room and took anything they could

Fast forward a few more years. It's the summer in which we move to Virginia. So my sister is still getting in trouble. One morning my other sister wakes me up and tells me we're going to my favorite place to get breakfast

We get there and she explains to me that my sister is getting sent to a camp in the wilderness where she will hopefully learn to get over herself. I realize that we went because there would probably be screaming and yelling while my sister was told.

We move to Virginia and live happily with her

She finally comes back and a few months later, the end of the line has come"" something like that. We wake her up and take her to the hospital to make sure she hasn't done anything to kill herself. The only thing they found was a burn mark on her arm, as well as what must be hundreds of scars from cutting herself, but nothing lethal.

Since then nothing too bad has happened but it seems like every once in a while

I presume I stopped loving her the moment she was sent to the wilderness. I no longer love her and I accept that. She consumes my life with bad and makes it harder for me to live happily. I figured if I didn't have any feelings towards her then I wouldn't be consumed when she does these terrible things.

The first time I used sex to save my ass was in highschool. I was failing Algebra/Trig my senior year and without the credit I wouldn't be able to graduate on time. It was the teacher who approached me that time. 

The second time I was the one who made the offer. In college I was completely in over my head in a certain course but the TA was friendly with me. With the final coming up and knowing I was going to bomb it I asked him one day if there was anything I could do for some extra credit to make sure I at least got some kind of passing grade. He did not get the hint at first but eventually I just flat out told him that I would sleep with him if he made sure I passed. He accepted.

I partied way too much in college. I had a bad fake ID and got into bars I shouldn't have been allowed into but it was sort of an open secret at several of the campus bars that so long as you any form of ID

As for the job? That's the worst one. I'd only been working there six months but it was my dream job. I loved it. And one day out of nowhere we were told that our office was being closed and that only 20% of us would be retained and moved to new offices. All of us who wanted to stay with the company had to re-apply. Since I had basically no senority I knew I had probably no chance. So during my interview I made it clear to the HR rep that I really wanted the job. As in

For such a long time I used sex to get what I wanted. These are just the biggest examples. I finally stopped behaving this way four years ago when I was about to tell my boyfriend's friend that I would have sex with him if he gave me some concert tickets I really wanted. For some reason that was the first time I realized how insane and amoral I was being.

Friend 1: Let's call her Mary. Mary is fucking ridiculously hot, and yet here she is scoring about 9.9/10, trophy wife material hotness I'm talking here, and weighing it at what must be a decently heavy, perfectly sculpted D-cup, and talking to me about what she thinks *really* happened to Starbuck. Her tits are so perfect I have to stop myself from reaching out and squeezing them half the time I see her. She walks around her house in that tiny little robe in front of us when we are over there. If neither one of you is looking at me, you better believe I'm staring down that shirt. Really. Those tits are that exquisite. Tits like this I did not think existed. Did I also mention she has a flawlessly body besides the 110% perfect tits? I feel like, and then died in her erotic majesty, right there

Then you have your other friend Trish (not her real name.) Trish's face is okay. She is an oddly shaped woman because she is normal height and size, but it was some letter that I didn't know they made bras that big. They're fucking huge and awesome. This is another of your friends that seems to have no qualms about walking around in front of me in a short bathrobe. I think she might do this on purpose sometimes. I try my best to sneak a peak whenever she wears something low cut, and I have gotten very close to seeing the nip. I'm still working on it. I feel there is some sexual tension between her and me, so the prospect of something actually happening between us makes me feel even more guilty, yet makes me want to push the boundaries even more. What is worse, is I think I am the only person in our circle of friends who has not seen them in their full glory. This sexual tension is possibly brought on by the fact when she and I first met, I drunkenly told her and her boyfriend how badly I wanted to fuck her and that if it were not for her boyfriend being my good friend

Then you have your other friend, unlike the above two. She is cool as fuck though. Once she told me that in passing how she liked to walk around with cum in her hair after giving a blowjob. She could possibly have been trolling me because she does that, which makes her even more cool.

They're attention whores and pretend to be model people when they have just as many problems as everyone else. Most of them are gunning for medical school and need to shove that fact down everyone's throat via constant status updates and faux-excitement over student groups

Indian girls especially are shallow and materialistic. They pretend to be religious because it's what daddy and mommy want

Most Indian-Americans kids have no interests other than whatever field their parents have chosen for them

1370019544.0,1few4s,I got a secret vasectomy.,shootingbabyblanks,235,96,149,"My wife and I met roughly 5 years ago

When we decided to get married she was fairly adamant about quitting her job.  I had no problem with it as she seemed fairly unhappy with it.  The truth is is that my wife wants nothing more than to be a mother.  I also wanted a family

About a year ago is when everything changed.  She got pregnant and we were both excited to have our first child.  However

The seed of doubt had been planted in my mind.  The question of whether this child was mine or this other mans was occupying my thoughts at every moment.  Trust is a huge issue for me and even the thought of her having another man's child was unbearable to me.  I debated leaving her

In the end

At this point she was a broken women.  She knew that things between her and I were less than stable and on top of that she was a woman who wanted nothing more than to have children who had just lost her first child.  She was suffering.  I, I still couldn't forgive her violation of my trust.  I knew I could never forgive.  I knew I could just divorce her, but I decided that was too easy and too quick for her.  She needed to suffer more in order to fulfill my need for vengeance.

At this point I formulated my plan of action.  I told her forgave her for her past infidelity.  I told her that I still loved her.  I told her whatever she needed to hear to make her think everything was alright.  Then I went on what I told her was a 10 day business trip.  Instead I went and got a vasectomy and relaxed in a hotel room.  I had decided that in order for her to pay her debt to me for what she had done I needed to take from her what she desired more than anything else: the ability to have a family.

At this point it has been a year since my vasectomy.  I have been tested multiple times and each time has confirmed I am ""shooting blanks.""  My wife thinks everything is normal between us and

I figure at this point there are about 3 likely outcomes from my situation:

A) We will continue to try to get pregnant and remain unsuccessful until she is of the age of no longer being able to bear children.

B) She gets tired of not being able to get pregnant and decides to leave me.

C) She gets pregnant again in which case I know that the baby isn't mine.

In all 3 of these scenarios I have planned out roughly the same course of action I will take when the time comes.  I have slowly and steadily started organizing my finances to be as liquid as possible.  I have moved large sums of money into things like Bitcoin so that the money trail can be anonymous and untraceable.  If she gets pregnant, well then maybe I will throw her a bone for being smarter than I give her credit for, but who knows, maybe I will just disappear with everything in that case too.

1355195213.0,14n6t8,I lost my virginity to my cousin when I was 13 and she was 11. (NSFW),throwaway71m3,182,42,108,"Ok...Here we go. I am sorry I'm using a throwaway, and I am 15(male), boyfriend/girlfriend

Flash Forward to winter of 2010. She’s 11 and I’m 13. My cousins and I (Sarah

Come summer of 2011-We are at my cabin and we are doing roleplaying (as we always do) and I’m playing a criminal. I “kidnap” her and she kisses me in order to persuade me to let her go. Soon enough, telling me how to do it or how fast/slow to do it. I’m getting into it, and then she gives me a handjob and I cum(for the first time). I didn’t know how to respond, and I thought I accidentally peed or something but she told me it happens when I’m happy(keep in mind, I’m from a sheltered christian family-I never got sex-ed until last year). Anyway, Sarah and I later that day filmed a short skit with our cousins that had the rough storyline of kids scaring their parents while they're asleep. Sarah thought it would be more realistic if she took off her shirt and bra(yes, she was wearing a bra at age 11-she was very developed at that age(and still is)). So I took of my shirt too and we just played the part of a couple cuddling in bed without shirts. We kept telling our younger cousins we needed to reshoot over and over again even though they did fine(I think you know why). 

Flash forward to december 2011. I was staying at her house for a week because my parents were off on some christmas missions trip. As you might have already guessed, Sarah was only wearing a cloth tied around her breasts and a skirt, no underwear.(this is important, as those skimpy clothes lead up to what happened later.) Anyway, I “captured” her after I “shot” her and I tied her to a tree. I got a boner from her skimpy outfit and I think she noticed. 

Anyway, as i was enjoying it. Sarah suggested that we all go shower up and then we can play another game. I cleaned up, put on loose pj pants and a tanktop and met up with the cousins. Sarah was only in a bathrobe. We decided we would essentially play house, where the younger cousins we the kids and we were the parents. Sarah told me she would put the kids to bed and would meet me in our bedroom. You can see the “kids” room from the “parents” room through a hall, and I saw her close the kids into bed and then she walked down the hall towards me. This scene is the most vivid, as this is when the “sexytimes” started. As she was walking I remember noting her smile, it was one I hadn’t seen her do before. As she walked towards the bedroom she untied her bathrobe and let it fall the the ground behind her. I remember the feeling of my penis swelling up with blood and how excited I was, I always thought they would just be stiff and unmoving. I had seen her breasts before when we were filming the movie, one leg on each side of me, bouncing

Next day, and hopped in the shower to get the chlorine out of my hair. After about 3 minutes, I heard the door open. The shower was steamy and I didn’t know who it was. I said “I’m in here!” and wiped a bit of the shower door so I could see through the steam who it was. Sarah was standing there, taking her bikini off and saying “I know, that why I came in.”. She came in the shower next to me, naked, and acted as if it was nothing. She said she’d put shampoo in my hair for me if I helped her too, and I leaned over and just started making out with her. I then went on to lick her lady parts. Her pubic hair was sorta in the way

Anyway, I had no fashion sense and had no idea what to do. She said “give me a moment to get ready, and all you have to do is pick out an outfit for me and put it on.”. She came out of the bathroom completely naked at this point, and showed me her suitcase full of clothes. I started with a leopard print pink bra and some panties. I was really horny and trying to control myself when I started fingering her as I was putting on her panties. She pushed my hand away and said “Nevermind, I’ll pick my own clothing.” And went into the bathroom and locked it. I felt like I had failed some sort of test or something. Anyway, as the week went on she became kinda loose with clothing around me. I kept myself under control, even when she came into my bed completely naked one night. But on the last day we are talking and she’s taking off her underwear and putting her bikini on while sitting on a chair. I catch a flash of her parts and kinda break. All my hormones, everything just kidna goes away and I lose control. I pushed her against the chair, and we didn’t see each other again until this october. 

We went to a theme park and had a really nice time. She didn’t seem mad at me or anything, cuddling with me when I’m watching tv and even giving me handjobs. I didn’t give in though, because I made a rule for myself to not have sex with her after what happened in the summer. She didn’t seem mad or anything, just her normal flirty self, half naked and hot as always. 

This concludes my confession, 3 times. Millions of sperm have died because of her and I have lustful thought about her all the time. I know it’s wrong because we are blood related, and we never used protection and I think I am very lucky that nothing happened. But I think if we weren't related we’d be dating or something like that. Anyway, I’m seeing her again this December and I just finished talking to her on the phone. Her and I are fine now, but she is always hinting at sex and things like that, such as something that happening in our last convo-she was talking about how her jeans have a hole in the crotch area, and I asked if she was going to throw them away or fix them, but I don’t want to seem like I’m using her. I just don’t know what to do. Ask me anything

My libido has been raging these last couple weeks (I'm not sure why).  I have been fantasizing (repeatedly) about watching my wife have sex with another man.  Being there.  Under her.  Right there.

Well

I pulled her on top of me (face to face).  I held her tight and low against me.  I positioned my erection against her abdomen with her pubis directly above my balls.  I was describing the fantasy in detail while making out, but I felt the warmth of her pussy juices flowing over my ball sack directly beneath her.  We had the upstairs sliding glass door open and the whole house fan on high (we often do this to drown out the sounds of our lovemaking to the kids in the house).  I knew her pussy was sloppy wet because the cool of the night air was evident on my pussy-juice soaked balls.

My wife doesn't say much (ever) during sex.  Kinda like fucking Helen Keller sometimes - which can be frustrating.  She makes noise - good... wonderful noise.  But she doesn't speak.  No ""ooh, sometimes I feel like I'm driving blind.

I personally believe what people consider to be their mental illness is actually an extremely beneficial evolutionary trait. To be able to not feel emotion while still being able to fake having it in order to blend in with society sounds like a tremendous boon and I constantly wish I had the same trait. I'm familiar with the connection between business leaders and psychopaths and I believe it makes total sense. They don't allow emotions to impede on their personal success and that allows them to master whatever they want. I feel like my sense of empathy has held me back my entire life and has allowed people to treat me like a doormat. I would love nothing more than to shut down all of my emotions and grasp the life I know I was born to live. 

I understand that sociopaths get the short end of the stick because they aren't able to fake emotions like true psychopaths. They spend their entire lives being shunned by society because of an inherent wrongness in their personality. But they're still able to live without feeling emotions and

Well, this is going to be pretty much pornographic. 

From the beginning... When I was about 11 and my sister was maybe 14, he took a real liking to me for some reason. He would always ask me to hang around them, even if they were going to make out or something. He started telling me about what he and my sis did together (at that point, a little bit of sex, lots of oral). He was really trying to get me involved in their relationship. Eventually, he convinced my sis to get me to kiss and make out with her for fun. I didn't know why the fuck not so I went along with it. He was always getting us to do something in front of him and he loved it. During all this, he would give me porn to watch that he thought i would like. A lot of lesbian stuff, or licking it up after he cummed on my sister. Once or twice

After months of this

My sister and I were close for  a while but drifted apart eventually. Last summer (we're both in our 20s now), for at least 30 mins, before we got undressed. We ate each other's pussies on her living room couch. After an hour or two of kissing, making out, licking, sucking, eating, and cuddling

So the next Friday, we bring two guys. We've been doing shit like that for months and a few weeks ago I decided to move in with her. We've got so close, she doesn't feel like my sister at all, just a best friend. With benefits, I guess. Our sex life is staying really hot and we're having lots of fun. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be doing this but fuck, I just can't think of a reason why not.

Out of the blue, to go out drinking last night (we're both in our late 20s now).  When we got back from the bars, his mom was still up and based on my friend, was probably on some sort of drugs.  There was an older man there with her in the living room - a slow man who I knew from my teenage years as the guy who attended every high school basketball game since the '60s or so for our city's main school.  My friend's mom met the guy when my friend used to play basketball for the team.  

My friend's mom was always a little crazy when we were growing up

Suddenly, and I was talking to my friend and telling him I really wanted to help her out and was on the verge of tears seeing her this way.  He was telling me it was no use as she's always like this now and was basically telling me to give it up.  I went into her room and was holding her in my arms and talking to her (it feels so weird to type this, but it felt natural last night) and my friend came in there and said we were going to go stay at this girl's house that he's talking to instead.  

When we were in the car, but wasn't going to bring it up in the open.  I feel like such a piece of shit.

We were at this girl's house for maybe 20 minutes tops and it was about 4 am at this point.  All I remember is a blurry scene of me loudly talking about how badly his mom looked, I met his mom in the living room.  She gave me a goodnight hug (she was always loving like that) and started talking depression again.  Out of nowhere, I was slowly kissing her on the lips.  When I heard the bathroom sink water running, we broke it off and she went into her room.  

I went into my friend's room to hang out a bit; when I finally went back into the living room to crash, but was also aware that my friend might have sensed something was up, so I was just saying thank you casually, goodnight, etc., while I was fondling her breasts.  

I got all settled on the couch and she kissed me goodnight on the lips and went back into her room. After lying there for a few minutes, my playing with her boobs and her rubbing my dick through my pants.  

We both instinctively went back to the living room.  I was laying on the couch and she was on her knees on the floor beside it.  I was whispering to her that we really shouldn't go any further, going to town on my balls and shaft.  I remember apologizing that I hadn't showered since the previous morning (it was now about 5 am) and she told me I tasted/smelled fine.  It was so surreal watching the dim outline of her face and she had her mouth all over my genitals.  Eventually, I finished off in her mouth, we again agreed to never tell anybody about this (""You think it'd be bad if he found out?  Imagine how much worse it would reflect on me.  I'm his mom."")  

She went to her bedroom and I fell asleep on the couch.

My friend was up earlier than me and made some eggs and bacon.  I was briefly awoken by this, said by to him, and got the hell out of there.  

I have felt weird all day.  I still cannot believe it actually happened

* Poo. This is probably my favourite.  Only a few times in my life have I shit and had it smell terrible to me. I usually really like the smell. I savour it while I'm pooing

* Menstrual blood. Yes I'm a girl. For some reason period blood has such a ""whole"" smell? It is very rich almost? There's more depth to the smell than just the metallic smell of regular blood. I always smell my tampons. When I used to wear pads they smelled even better (maybe a mix of crotch sweat too? I'm not sure but the smell was INCREDIBLE). 


Maybe you're the same as me or maybe you're absolutely disgusted.  Maybe I can redeem myself by saying the  smells I don't like:

* Vomit.  It's probably the association with one of the worst things ever (puking) that makes me not like the smell.

I then started dating another girl too soon after. She was a horrible person in disguise. She started the relationship by making us seem like a perfect fit.

I slipped into an even greater depression. Then I picked myself up. I got into incredible shape. Not just casual, handsome, and in incredible shape.

Yet my insecurities have crippled me. My depression has become worse and worse. Every relationship since then has been a culmination of myself not being able to trust them. Usually ends up with them getting dumped.

From late 1999 to early 2001, and I got so the backstory was so consistent that it seemed real, even to me. I found older women - in their late 40’s/50’s - through dating sites and just by contacting random strangers through instant messenger. I was never flirty with them, never sexual, nothing like that, but all of the women I emailed with were vulnerable in some way. A couple of them were unemployed and living with family, one of them was marginally employed but suffered from poor health, another was just looking for some sort of adventure in her life.

I liked the attention. I liked always having emails waiting for me. I liked it that I was someone these people admired. It eased my loneliness - at the time, I ended it. I told them at the time that I was only looking for friends, and that I thought women made better pen pals. I gave them some bullshit about women being easier to talk to, open to new ideas, etc, but really all it was was that I was afraid if I had a male pen pal, he’d eventually realize that he wasn’t talking to another man.

I would take stories from my own life or stories I had heard, what towns he had lived in, what jobs he’d had, what countries he had traveled in, what businesses he had owned. I made details about his childhood, even right down to what the wallpaper in his childhood bedroom had looked like. I had an entire timeline of his life so that the story would be consistent from person to person, so that I would never be caught in my own lie. His life was a reflection of what I wanted my life to be at that age

And it worked. People believed me. Like I said, I always had an excuse as to why I didn’t want a romantic online relationship (“The profile is sort of old, and I’m seeing someone right now” “I really want to get to know you first” etc). A few of them were surprisingly fine with just being friends. It’s just that dating sites are a good place to find people who were willing to open themselves up to another person - remember this was the early 2000’s, before there were a lot of pen pal sites.

I happily hid behind this persona online and eventually began instant-messaging every day with this one woman named Pat. Pat was going through a rough time in her life - she was deeply in debt, whom she despised. There had been a domino effect of shitty happenstances that had occurred in her life over the course of a few years that had landed her in that position. Pat was in her early 50’s, and I got so that I really enjoyed talking with her. She was smart and funny and open to talking about all the new ideas that were fermenting in my teenaged head, which I pretended were coming from a 50-something dude who was undergoing an emotional awakening after a lifetime of emotional suppression. She didn’t have anything better to do and I, being a now 15 year old teenager on summer break in a town where I had no friends, didn’t have anything better to do either.

Pat lived in Minnesota, so I would just tell her what the waves looked like), I even sent her some shells from a beach when I vacationed in FL late that summer so that the postal code stamp would be near where I had told her that I lived. I made up historical facts to tell her (which were completely false), I went through “relationship dramas” as this man that she advised me on, I told her of spiritual awakenings that I’d experienced, she told me things she said she’d never told anyone, etc. I found pictures online of a random nobody and sent those to her, claiming it was my home. We were good friends. It’s just that I wasn’t who she thought I was.

Pat very nearly caught me a few times, she wanted to meet me. In fact, by the end, she insisted on it.

By that time, when I was pretending to be this “friend” with a business and I “interviewed” her for a job that didn’t exist in a small business that didn’t exist. She wanted to speak to me - the fake me - on the phone, and somehow I always managed to beg her off, telling her that my phone was broken (which was ridiculous, since most internet still ran off the phone line in those days) and that I would call her soon, soon, I promise

I would lay awake at night

The day came when she was going to fly from Minnesota to the airport near where I “lived” in southern Florida. We had one last instant messenger conversation, I’d have a sign and balloons and everything. I gave her a made-up phone number to reach me with. I agreed that she could stay at my place for a few weeks until she got a couple of paychecks under her belt and she could find her own place. It was like I was watching a stranger typing those words to Pat, like I was on auto-pilot, like it wasn’t real.

She had told me that she had never taken this big of a chance, my fake persona) had had in his life. She was tired of being scared of life and wanted to embrace it.

Those next several hours were torturous. I tried to act normal at home but it was impossible. Again

A day later, according to the yellow pages. Three more emails came throughout the course of the next 36 hours. She was writing the email from a library and only had enough money to stay at a hotel another few nights and then she didn’t know what she was going to do since she didn’t have enough money to get back home. She said she had never taken a leap of faith in her entire life, and that she had trusted me because she just needed one person in the world who she could trust and who believed she was a worthwhile human being after all of the shit that had happened to her in the past few years. She berated herself for being an idiot, for being misled, for going with her heart instead of her brain.

It tore me up. Look, despite everything - that was going through such turmoil, and that I had caused it.

Her last email was one last attempt to get in touch with me, I shut down that entire email address and put that entire episode behind me. I don’t know what happened to her.

There were so many red flags she should have seen, I managed to give it to her - maybe she just WANTED to believe and so she ignored her rational mind. But you know that episode of the Simpsons where Bart writes fake love letters to Mrs. Krabapple, who believes they are from a real guy? And how torn up Bart is when he realizes how upset and humiliated Mrs. K will be when she realizes she’s been duped? That’s how I felt - I let the whole thing go too far, and I must have really hurt and humiliated someone. I feel terrible about that. It wasn’t right, I shouldn’t have done it, no excuses, period.

Every time this memory pops into my head

TL;DR: I pretended to be a guy online and a woman moved half-way across the country to be with someone that didn’t exist because I was too scared to tell the truth.

Since my face had turned quite ugly, talking in a silly western accent and shooting my friends with my fingers. And of course, to keep bright lights out of my eyes, my father lent me an old wide-brimmed hat, which made for even more cowboy lines. Of course this got boring, and playing outside got difficult due to my light sensitivity.

Over time, cards with my sister, and eventually when we picked up a computer, minesweeper. I had nearly dropped out of contact with all of my friends, and I never really talked anymore. My parents switched me into homeschooling, and became very protective since my eye had never fully healed.

Fast forward to when I turned 12, etc. I had learned to deal cards and play poker, which we did as a family just about every other night (playing for 'chore coupons'). I had a very lovely childhood, everything seemed to go well. But I NEVER went outside, and my skin was extremely pale, so one summer we went to the beach. My sister was very tan and blended in well with other kids, but I stood out like a sore thumb. With a black and white checkered bandana

Other kids started to gather around me and ask me to help with their sand castles, I was about 5'10"". Combining that with my strange attire and pale skin, kids either were scared of me or drawn to me. While I was taught to play volleyball by my sister and her friends, one kid decided to tease me by taking my bandana and running off with it. Seeing my scarred face and jagged lips, the younger kids screamed and ran to their parents. All the others just stared at me, some giggling in the background. I just stood there shaking a bit while the bandana was returned to me by the little kid, his mother apologizing frantically to my angry parents. 

Needless to say, and tensions got high between my mother and father (he wanted to pay for the surgery, she wanted me to be who I was). I just silently listened to the rest of the world as I sat there, playing cards and video games for the next 5 years. 

I had taken I huge interest in gaming professionally, but I was never good at math. By age 18, looking for a career had become something I just didn't care about. So I stuck to loafing around and playing games, surfing the net, and reading books. My sister was in college studying to become a mathematician, and I was living at home getting skinnier, sicklier, and didn't dispute it. They were too protective of me, my jaw was covered in small cuts along with the large

Over all of those years away from any lights other than a TV or monitor's glow, and I had it fixed. Almost. The doctor said too much damage had been done over the years I ignored it, and I wouldn't ever be able to see very well in the light again. I became extremely angry at myself for being so stupid, and dedicated most of my time to working out in order to vent my frustrations. Unexpectedly, I did well, and managed to become very fit by the age of 19. I didn't do much with my newfound strength, but it certainly helped to clear my mind. I got inspiration from the internet and my cousin

Now, some of the mental damage is irreversible, it seems. I developed an intense fear of letting my face be seen by anyone, and still I have trouble looking in the mirror without cringing. I had cut my skin so badly in my teenage depression, I had actually caused even more permanent damage, leaving everything below the bandana a scarred and disfigured mess.

While I can now see in light fairly well and I have normally tanned skin, and I've developed excellent night vision from turning partially nocturnal. However, despite all of this, I've never paid for the plastic surgery to fix my face. I keep it as a reminder of the past and why I got to where I am. I have a whole collection of bandanas to match my suits and ties, and I wear prescription sunglasses. 

And you know what? I'm happy. I have a wonderful family


**TL;DR** *an accident when I was five disfigured my face and made me sensitive to light, went through angst as a teen which led to cutting my face even further, and eventually majored in psychology after a sudden burst of hope, although I still am terrified of bright lights and my own face.*",,False,,False,t3_xpu6n

My first kiss happened in the worst way possible. I had gone to a party in my dorm, three years older, and seemed like a cool guy. Way out of my league. I didn't care, I was never particularly interested. I like being friends with guys, because I feel like I can't attract them. Sam seemed nice, I just wanted to be his friend. He had let on over the course of the night that he and his girlfriend were no longer together. I was not aware that she was there earlier in the evening, that they had fought and she had left.

I was having a lot of fun. I had drank quite a bit, and I partook. 

I was sitting on the bed, I honestly had no idea what to do. I was high and drunk, not in a good state of mind. I remember the look on his face exactly, I had been extremely flattered at the time, but now the memory of his smile makes me sick.

A little later we all went to his room, you can stay."" 

I went into his bed and told that I'd never kissed anyone, I tried, but it wasn't pleasant. Then he told me to get out of bed and take off my clothes. At first I just stripped to my bra and underwear, but he told me to take it all off. I did, he was the first guy who seemed interested in me, I didn't want to disappoint. 

He began to grab my breasts roughly, but I didn't want to disappoint. I did it and he seemed unsatisfied with my skills and asked me to get on top of him. We tried having sex. He had no condom. It didn't work. I was too tight. I felt inadequate, I couldn't do anything right. So I continued to blow him until he came in my mouth.

What he said immediately after destroyed me. ""This was a mistake, but I had failed. I still had his taste in my mouth (I'm sorry, this is too much information, but I just need to get it out). I felt ashamed, disgusting, inadequate. I went to my room and cried. I felt like a whore.

The next morning he came to my room

For the rest of the week every time I saw him, that I wanted to be friends but didn't know how. I told him that I felt ashamed about what happened. He told me I was being neurotic. He has avoided me ever since. I guess I was being neurotic. I had thought I could talk to him about it, but I was wrong. ""Don't stick your dick in crazy""--I was crazy. I became really depressed. I was suicidal for a while. Any self worth I had was destroyed by this incident. Which is stupid, I guess. It wasn't a big deal, no one else would react that strongly.

I can't wrap my head around it now. Had I scared him away by being crazy? Why had I done that? Why couldn't I act normally? It's not like he raped me. I had definitely agreed

And I just wanted to know... why me? It seemed he just wanted to get his dick wet. Why did he choose me? There was at least one other girl there

I hate myself so much now... but I guess I always did. I think the depression is clinical

The worst part is I don't know how to think about the event. I look back on it and I get an odd mixture of turned on and absolutely disgusted. It was the first contact I'd ever had with a guy. I didn't know what to make of it. And when I see him

Now I feel severely uncomfortable around guys. I feel like I can only kiss them if I am drunk

I don't know how to feel about this. I still feel awful and dirty. I feel crazy and worthless. I guess I can't ask you what to think... I need some imput, I just don't know how...

TL:DR The night I had my first kiss I almost lost my virginity

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for what you are saying. This has actually helped me think clearly about this. It took me until now really to see that I don't have to be defined by what this guy, but the only things that got hurt were my feelings. I really appreciate what all of you have said.**

I'm a [M] 22 yo and here's some back story... My earliest memory of being molested is when I was 5 yo, I should mention here that my family are Pakistani Expats living in Saudi Arabia... I don't recall much about that day, all I remember is that I was in the water, wearing only underwear and this neighbor kid who was older (mid-teens) came to play with me, I remember him pulling down my underwear and making me sit in his lap while he had his penis out...

Fast forward 4 years and when I was 9 yo, at first he just asked me to rub his back after my brother would go to sleep, then he started rubbing my back, eventually he would touch my butt and asked me to do the same, it later escalated to full-on anal sex...
After two more years, I never said a word...

Finally, he'd invite me to his home and we'd perform homosexual acts on each other, to this day I'm not sure if that makes me bisexual because I usually did it so that he'd loan me some porn CDs, but I eventually asked him to stop, it made him angry, he even threatened to expose me as a faggot to everyone but I didn't go back to him.

Here's the deplorable part: When I was about 11, I remember that when we slept together he started touching me... I didn't stop him because it's the same way it started with my uncle... and it shames me to say this but it felt good... later on he would put my hand on his penis...it even reached a point where I asked him to play with mine... but that was it, I told him to stop...

The last thing is a bit recent and thereby the worst in comparison, I would play with the children... one of my cousins who is 14 years old was particularly fond of me... we'd often play hide and seek etc... One evening before the wedding, she and I were alone on the roof, I was running after he and accidentally grabbed her butt... Something animalistic snapped in me, although there was a conscious rational part of me that new it was wrong but I kept thinking how firm her buttocks were, how good it would feel to... violate her.... I made her sit right beside me and continued to talk to her, I didn't directly touch her in anyway further but I used the pretense of tickling her to feel her up a little bit... finally, in fact I almost felt like I was on the verge of orgasm

What makes me feel immensely horrid and guilty is the fact that right now both my brother and my cousin may seem fine to me but my abuse at the hands of my uncle and teacher didn't start bothering me till I hit my 20s, I know that it was a long time ago and he initiated it but I was the older one, I should have stopped it right there but the case of my cousin absolutely disgusts me... I'm a horrible horrible human being, I hate myself for what I've done, I wish there was some way I could make things right again... My dad always told me that I was a coward, I guess he was right, I never had the courage to stop people from hurting me and now I've become a predatory monster...

I've dropped out of two colleges, my parents and I talked it over and decided that culinary school was the best option for me. They warned me that this was my last chance, and if I fucked up again, they would pretty much disown me financially.

Well, and from what I've been told, the old program was much better and was really about food and love and passion. Now, it all seems so technical. I've really tried, but I can't help but be really unhappy.

I haven't told my parents any of this. They're so proud of me for the first time in years, I can at least have some money instead of being thrown out into the streets. 

All of my issues with motivation, not to mention ADD, started around the time I was 12. Middle school is stressful for everyone, but for some reason I just adopted this new ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude, and it never really went away. This was around the time my grades went from straight A's to low B's and even C's, and thus I really started fighting with my parents.

At 12 I was still a good kid, slacker that I am today. I know that a lot of people will say that your mistakes help you out in life, and make you who you are today, but I really don't care. If I could do it all over again I would. I would be a better daughter, sister, friend, student, everything.

Get good grades, make lifelong friends, find a great job, and meet the love of my life and get married and have babies and all that. I really feel like I've put all those things in jeopardy for what started in middle school for me. Now I'll probably end up working a string of dead end jobs, always be poor, and die alone.

Sorry this has been so long. I just needed to get a lot of stuff off my chest.

I love the girl more than my own life. She is the mother of my child, while severely crippling for her, is also exhausting for me. She constantly keeps me up late at night upset about how miserable in her life she is, how nobody cares about her, or how she's a bad mother. I see everyone day how amazing of a mother she is and contradictory evidence of all of these things. I try to comfort her, but attempts are futile. 

Sometimes, or have a night without wondering if I'll say the wrong thing and send her in to a bout of depression or that we'll see something on TV that will reminder her off her mother across the country, sending her to tears. It would be nice. 


She currently goes to a therapist about once every two weeks. She has been on prozac for about a week and a half now and we're waiting for it to kick in. 

I know she is sick


I have a severe case of ADHD and one hell of a temper. She has major depression and OCD. I often look down at my son snd tell him, because either side of the genetic coin you get, you're gonna be fucked."" 

I want her to be happy. It will make me happy. I just hope she'll stay happy. Because I don't know how much longer I can do this.

**Edit:**

I really didn't expect this much of a response. Let me address a few things brought up by the majority of comments:

Prozac will not be the first anti-depressant she has been on. She took Celexa earlier in the spring

As for the top comment

For those of you that are calling me a bad person, have been in. I love her very much, and I accept and overlook her sickness. However, her sickness is not the equivalent of a cold, or something physical that only affects them. A sickness like the one I and others have described are sometimes crushing to a partner in a relationship. It effects the other it affects the other to a degree that can only be seen from behind closed doors, and most of the time, closed mouths.

Skip to the **TLDR** below if you want. 

Before I begin


**14-16**

It began when I was 14. I used to smoke a lot of weed and it got very expensive very quickly. I started selling to close friends so that my smoke was free, then started searching my room. They would take my drugs and try and reprimand me, but I just ignored them. I wasn’t a bad kid, I wasn’t aggressive, I did good at school and went every day, I had good friends who weren’t in to drugs and we used to play a  lot of sport together, so it was conflicting for them. They would just try and explain to me about the risks of getting caught


When I was around about 16 years old, and a few k a month wasn’t going to cut it. I asked my dealers what else they had and they started me selling meth, x and LSD and coke. Back in the suburbs, people went wild for this. It boosted profits very quickly, and also brought me to the attention of several other dealers in the area. I had stayed relatively under the radar until then, because I really only sold to friends and those in my high school. I had, unbeknownst to me


My first set back came when I had a late night phone call from a friend asking if I could supply his friend with a large amount of coke. I’d done large deals before so I was phased by that, my friend was at a rival dealers house and had been threatened that if he didn’t set me up that he wasn’t leaving in tact. I walked right in to my first ambush, and realised that up until that point luck had gotten me by, not any real kind of skill. 


They stole about 4k’s worth of coke, and whilst good at selling drugs, I was not very experienced in the art of intimidation or violence. I’m a skinny white kid and had never been in a fight in my life, let alone had any knowledge of how to beef with unemployed full time drug dealers. I did what seemed logical, I paid 20 or so gang members from an Asian gang in my area to send a message to those who wanted me out of business.  Stupid in hindsight and totally of out character. 


For the next few days I would drive around with them pointing out those who were affiliated with the people trying to drive me out of business, and justified it by telling myself I didn’t start this, and they had no right to tell me to stop dealing. It got out of control very quickly when one of the people we attacked fought back. He was beaten pretty bad, and during which I tried to convince some of them to stop. I was told quite plainly, this was what I wanted. After that, there were a few retaliatory attacks against those I’d employed to help me, but I had somehow been forgotten about. I decided I would never go that route again


**17-18**

I didn’t have any further violent run in’s, and I would go from car to car dropping their order in the front seat. My neighbours had banded together to stop me, and started noting down the license plates of my customers, duration and frequency of their  visits, and taking photos of me in the act of selling. This brought the police to my house one afternoon. 


The cops sat down with my parents and informed me of my neighbourhoods surveillance and suspicions. They asked me to explain myself. I said I couldn’t, backed me up. The cops had nothing on me, apart from my neighbours suspicions and blurry photographs that showed nothing. They told me that things would get very serious when I turned 18, and that I should think about that. I did. 


A month before my 18th birthday


**18-28**

I became a little reclusive and went to a university interstate to study computer science. No-one there knew my past


I finished university when I was 21 with good grades, I got a job working part time at a mobile phone shop whilst looking for a better job in my field of study. 


One drunken night sitting around the TV with my friend, and that was how we became friends when we were kids. Drugs weren’t something we spoke about or did together. He had been  an on/off weed smoker/tripper  and a small time dealer himself, but had never had any drama like I had. He was smart, kept it small, and only used it to fund his infrequent habit. Like me, he hadn’t sold drugs for years either. 


Neither of us were broke or living beneath the poverty line. We were renting a house in a nice area near our families


We did this for about a year, only did deals inside the house, restricted the number of deals we did in one day. We made out with about 30k in cash each after a year, and thankfully my smart friend convinced me to get out whilst we were on top. I was almost 23. 


About 6 months later, and that I had sold drugs, but didn’t know to what extent. She knows it’s in my past, that it’s not  who I am any longer (well, until a few years later),  and we didn’t speak about it any further. I got a job in my field of study, and started working my way up the corporate ladder. 


**28-30**

My girlfriend and I had been earning good money for about 4-5 years, and stumbled across bitcoin. It was intriguing, and I was captivated by it’s potential to make profits that weren’t tracked by the tax department.  I spent many months researching and getting to understand how I could use the bitcoin system to make money. During my research I of course found out that a large number of people wanted coins to buy drugs on the Silk Road. I invested about 20k in to the system and traded coins for about a year across a number of exchanges. When I wanted to cash out, I would sell the coins via gumtree or craigs list for cash in the mail or in though person exchanges. After a few months, and making less than impressive  profits. I started to think about The Silk Road. 


I had told myself years ago I wouldn’t start selling drugs again. I had gotten away with it previously, and he said even though it sounded bullet proof, there is always something you forget. I took his words of wisdom to heart, and documented the process to ensure I understood how it worked. I then spent the next week writing this document 


http://ge.tt/6Kj3S1G/v/0 


I posted it on a number of drug forums for feedback, but couldn’t question my level of preparation. My girl and I talked about it, and she hated the idea. She knew it was something I had gotten away with before, but knew that once I set my mind to something, it was hard to talk me out of it. She begrudgingly agreed to not stop me, but if anything ever happened she would  feign ignorance and I would need to take all the blame. I of course agreed. I don’t think she entirely knew the possible consequences of what she was agreeing to. I had distribution and laundering covered. I all I needed was a supply. I told myself and my girl that I would stop when I made 20k. 


I spent the next 6 months finding reliable IRL dealers, I had a good flow of product out, and an equal flow of cash in from the BTC I sold. It was working. It was around this time, I started to get really paranoid and stressed. It wasn’t like the times before. This time I had a worried girlfriend asking me when I was going to stop, I had a good career I was risking and keeping up with selling on SR and laundering the cash IRL was a full time job and then some.


I got to 20k in about a year and dismantled the operation as I had set out to. I had kept my promise to my girlfriend, and this allows me to put more cash on my mortgage. 


**Today**


It’s been about 7 months since I stopped selling on SR. I think about it all the time. I know I’ve now gotten away with selling drugs too many times in my life to ever risk it again. I make enough money from my job that I don’t need to do this, and that’s what I’m fighting now. It’s a business I’ve understood since I was a kid, and I’ve always been more interested in the profits than the partying aspect of drugs. I think constantly about trying to convince my girl to let me try again, but I don’t think for a second she would be ok with it again. I think I only got  her to agree to it because she was blind sided and shocked that I would even ask her. Now she’s thought about it more, the risk has sunk in. It should have sunk in for me too. I think I like the risk. I like having a double life that people don’t know about. 


I’m sitting here in my office writing this


I hope this doesn’t come across as a bragfession. I am not proud of selling drugs and would never encourage anyone else to. 


It’s peculiar that if I were to give myself advice


Don’t bother selling drugs, and the cops can’t touch you.


I just need to take my own advice. 


**TLDR;** Sold drugs from 14-18 and got away with it despite a close call with police and violent rival drug dealers. Ran a hydroponic house when I was 21-23. Sold drugs on SR and made about 20k when I was 28-30. Work in management of a large corporation and no-one knows.

The guilt of keeping it a secret and knowing whether I made the right call, friends, and GFs/wife all looked up to him, so I didn't feel like I could say anything to them.

For the past few years, but as a result, I had incredible anxiety about starting college. Excelling in high school put me in a bad place because my parents, oblivious to my state of mind, pushed me to go to the best school I could get into. And I did. To be fair, it was my original dream school, so hopefully

I stumbled out of the gate, but I still underperformed relative to my expectations. The thing is on top of my already existing sense of worthlessness my poor grades really weighed on me and pushed me into doing drugs. And by doing drugs I mean I drank enough to not be afraid to pretend to be as drunk as everyone else, and I smoked enough to hangout with kids with skateboards (sorry people who enjoy skateboarding but not weed). Basically, not much, but enough to be a great departure from my usual lifestyle. After that, I started to become more social.

I got to know a lot of people

Depression is a pretty big turn off apparently

So feeling pretty shitty one night (around the end of November if I remember correctly), but he laughed and said he'd pay three times as much for me. How sweet. And that was the end of it. Or was it?

It wasn't. Maybe 3 or 4 days later he comes over to my desk and lays down $30 in front of me. I looked up at him, and it turns out he was kind of like me. No girlfriends, feels empty. I didn't mention how I was feeling though. I really felt for the guy, and I thought it was an opportunity for my to fulfill myself as well. Just him laying down the money was enough to make me feel desirable for once. The actual experience was quite strange at first, but I liked it. It was quick and clean cut (though not actually clean), and he kind of shook it off right after, but it stayed in my mind for awhile. I brought it up later that night

It went downhill from there. We did pretty much the same thing again a few times, but he never had any real release. My friend threw me under the bus and mentioned my name to him, and I just couldn't turn him away. I knew what I could do for him, and I knew what he could do for me. He didn't just want a blowjob though. I was hesitant to do more, but I guess everything has its price. 

Word spread slowly to a very small collection of people, and I remained at 8 ""customers"" *shudders* for the last two months of the semester, so I had some confidence that I wouldn't be revealed. At that point though, I was no longer just doing a favor for a friend. I was essentially a prostitute turning tricks for money. The money was almost secondary though. These guys made me feel desirable, loved, *happy*.

I set up specific rules with these guys. There were things I would and wouldn't do, things not many people outside of porn have done, and I am really ashamed of myself, but I don't think I can give up what these guys do for me lest I revert back to my old self.

Ask me anything you like I guess. Just don't ask where I live/where I go to school/etc.

1363653535.0,1ak80v,"I've been a bit of a sick, voyeuristic fuck when it comes to one of my close, female friends.",throwitawayveryfar,215,75, and I have a close female friend that I spend a lot of time with. Nothing more than that, I really love her and our friendship. But

Being such good friends, she even lived with me and my girlfriend for a few months. I remember trying to get a peek at her when she'd take a shower occasionally. Never was I lucky to get a good look. But there were a few other occasions, which I still look back on regularly. The first was when she was still living with us, and she was dealing with various, horrible illnesses. She was always sick and had a lot of problems with her 'insides'.. She had to get a colonoscopy at one point, and in preparation, the doctors gave her some drink pumped with laxatives and some other insane shit so she could cleanse her systems before going under. This is probably a good time to mention I have a really intense fart/scat fetish.. you might know where this is headed. One morning, she awoke moaning and groaning. I was getting ready for work and I knew what this meant. She had already made it clear what she was doing and to excuse her constant trips to the toilet. But this morning was bad. She was clearly in a lot of pain and discomfort, grunting and swearing as she painted the bowl with her shit. It sounded horrific. She was making all sorts of noises, outside the window. I still feel a lot of disgust and shame for that memory

Another particularly creepy and sleazy moment occured a while down the track from the last incident. By now, like she often did with me and my partner. We all watched a movie, and my partner and this girl fell asleep watching it on the couch. My partner was on one couch, my friend on the other. But the position she had fallen asleep in was very... opportunistic. She was curled up in the fetal position, facing away from the TV. So her tight little ass, which was barely covered by the thin material of her yoga pants, was sticking right out. Her *amazing* ass. I could make out her pussy, through the thin lycra material. I slowly crept up, and a very light sleeper. I managed to move slowly and quiet enough to get my face a mere centimeter away from her ass and pussy. I was so close I could smell it. I could smell that beautiful smell of a young, taking in deep breaths

As intense and amazing as the arousal gained from these voyeuristic activities was, and I exploited her, without her knowledge, for my own sick, sexual fantasies. On a deep level, I objectified her in a pretty big way and I hate that. She is a woman I respect and admire. I also hate the way I have gone behind my partners back and received sexual gratification from another woman, her best friend no less. I have mixed emotions, I look back on them fondly. But I know what those memories reflect about myself, and for the most part, which is always going to be ruled by these primal

Barring any unforeseen situation, all the ""but people love you"" or ""Suicide is selfish"" bullshit, but given my circumstances there really is no other foreseeable end for me.

Let me tell you a quick story: I've watched a lot of my family die. Ever since I was 11 or 12 I've watched someone die every two or three years. Deaths in the family might not seem like much, no girlfriend, nothing. Now I'm 26, I've been an alcoholic for 5 years, drinking nearly nightly. At best I may have gone 5 to 7 days sober in those 5 years. I've not been on a date for 3 years since I've had my confidence trashed, and it was trashed because I wanted sex to be meaningful and not just pleasure. I've tried asking my two female friends to just cuddle with me, which I understand is intimate, so I don't have anyone to care for me on an important emotional level. 

All that being said, one month before I turn 30, I'm going to off myself one way or another. By then I'll have suffered for 30 years, why should I want to suffer another 60? 30? or even one more year? No one has proven that I am deeply important, so they can cry at a funeral and pretend I meant something, but they're never going to take the time to prove I did.",,,,

It was about 6 years ago, outlined in the darkness, your sweating shillouette standing there, breathing deeply. Naked. Not knowing what to do. 

We had been friends for about 5 months at this time. The second I met you I knew that I wanted nothing more than to wrap my arms around you and fuck the living day lights out of you. I could tell from the indent in the small of your back that you had been working out. No one looks like that naturally. No one. 

You were helping my housemate move into our new house. I had never met her before, but your smile made me look past that. 

I walked right up to you and introduced myself. You said your name was Craig, I still had the reminance of my Londoner's (England) lilt that you said you found charming. I couldn't help but make eye contact with you. I wanted to do nothing but to just stare at you all day. Watch you help her move her things in.

Since it was summer and we were both living in a po-dunk university town, and constant gym visits. I lived well, and paid the price for it. I had a body to maintain and that was never easy. I was pretty ripped at this point, and still am, but nothing compared to you. 

You were standing on my front poarch one august morning

I sat on the poarch with you and Bindi and joked a couple hours. NOthing to talk about

There was a time when I thought you and Bindi were a thing

One afternoon I was sitting on the poarch

I explained that Bindi had gone out. You told me that you weren't there to see her

We drank, looks that expressed some kind of interest. An interest I could only hope was true to what I thought was going on. An interest that I wanted to be more than just ""an interest.""

We drank for six hours, and you told me you were too drunk to drive. I told you to stay on my couch in the living room. You had told me that you were straight, I didn't correct you. 

At 2am I heard a knocking on my door. I had passed out and struggled to wake up. I grumbled a lifeless, and I stared in the darkness for a while. I could see it was you. 

You stood there, you were scared. I sat up. Confused, drunk and somewhat unnerved. You moved closer. 

I had no idea what to do. You just kept coming closer and closer to me. You sat at the edge of the bed. You still didn't say a word to me, but you just put your hand on my leg and squeezed. I stopped talking. 

You looked at me, and you told me I was perfect. 

I could feel where this was going, but as far as I knew you were straight. You were the body building hungarian that all my female friends taunted me about, and told me to stop liking because things like this don't happen in real life. 

I sat up in bed

You gentle pushed me back down onto the bed

You took your hands and placed them on my shoulder

You kissed me, then my stomach. I stopped you before my hard cock came into sight. I grabbed the sheet, and look straight into your eyes. Lust was the only thing I saw, and I knew I could let go. I did. 

You removed the sheet, naked, not knowing what to do. You got into bed. You got back on top of me and kissed me.

I can still feel your pelvis grinding against mine. This was your first time

I rolled onto my side

We fell asleep entangled with one another. I woke up first and quietly climed out of bed and made my way to the bathroom. By the time I got back to the room

You just looked at me. I could see the birth of a smile. Slow from the corner of the mouth

I apologized; I had slept with straight boys before and knew that they liked to be made to feel that all the decisions were made by me and I was the reason we ended up sleeping together. SOmething about allowing them to remember that they were men

He got up

You had 2 coffees. 2 sandwiches, do you wanna?"" I thought you meant breakfast...the pace with which you removed your clothes clearly showed you wanted something else. 

This continued for 2 years. We fucked like rabbits. People knew, it ended. You're now married to a wonderful woman, and I wouldn't trade my husband for anything in the world. 

But there we go. That was us.

http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x2o41/husbands_of_redditim_the_man_fucking_your_wife/

Oh boy.  This got quite a bit more attention than I anticipated. 

Lot of hate.  Wasn’t expecting that much to be honest.

It’s pretty obvious there are quite a few people on here who have been affected by infidelity

I’ve had some time to step back from the situation and regroup.  I’m still terribly embarrassed and ashamed by my actions and for those asking

I do want to respond to a couple accusations / assumptions made about me and my situation before giving am update on what has happened since.

I know that pretty much any response I make to inaccuracies is going to be attributed to trying to explain away my actions.  Let me stop you there.  It’s not.  I know what I did was fucked up and wrong and I don’t deny that for a second

Firstly, self aware, educated, confident…..just unhappy.  I’m not some lion stalking prey on the savannah looking for my next kill.  And it wasn’t only about the sex.  These women were getting a sense of excitement, a thrill from meeting someone who was genuinely interested in them as a woman.  In some cases, something they hadn’t felt in years. I fed off that excitement.  It made me feel good that I could help someone who was unhappy feel a little bit of joy and desire.  And the unhappiness that comes with a fractured relationship is so deep, people in these situations so hurt and looking for some kind of connection, but nonetheless it wasn’t just about sex, appreciative

UPDATE:  Yesterday morning I emailed “Jessica, how sorry I was and let me know if there was anything I could do.  

Ten minutes later, but I’m not sure I buy it.  After the initial shock and fighting, she said things eventually turned civil and they had a real conversation about their relationship for the first time in years.  They were both unhappy.  They bolt felt they married too young.  The both felt unappreciated, undesired and that they married the wrong person.  They agreed they were going to separate.  Last night, he packed up and moved into his girlfriend’s house LESS THAN A MILE AWAY.

So I told Jessica, but I couldn’t sleep with her.  She asked if I was interested in dating after her divorce was finalized.  And here Reddit, is where I took your advice.  I thought about it, and I would have dated her after divorce was finalized.  But it wouldn’t have been serious for me (I would have been honest about that).  And it was NOT about the allure of the taboo being lost, it was about allowing this women a chance to recover from a fucked up situation that I had helped create.  So I told her I didn’t think it was a good idea, and that this was a time in her life where she needed to figure things out for herself.  I told her I would be grateful to be a friend and support mechanism, but not her lover.

So I don’t have any illusions that this makes up for the fact that I contributed to breaking up a family.  I wouldn’t say it’s a happy ending


I’m sorry it happened.

I’m sorry for my part in it.

It’s not something I’ll forget or repeat.

The massages eventually were not enough for me and I moved to looking for escorts to hook up with.

It got to the point where i was usually spending somewhere around $1000 to $2000 a month just on massage parlors and escorts. None of my friends knew this and no one ever thought anything was up since I would also hook up with girls from clubs or bars when the chance arose.

I ended up putting together a whole fake profiled on OKCupid using some random pictures I found on the internet. In his profile he said he was looking for someone local so I even looked up neighborhoods near where he lives (he moved cross country years ago for college) and found an apartment building near him that I innocently claimed to live in on my profile. I must have spent over an hour creating the fake accounts (Yahoo mail

The next day I had tons of replies to my fake profile. I ignored them all except for the one from Kyle

Still thinking it was funny I began to chat with him using the fake YIM account I had made. I was a lot more aggressive with him than I ever am with guys. I must have overdone it because early on he accused me of being a bot or a marketer or something. Eventually he began to trust me

It became a fun little prank. Almost every night before bed we would chat and talk about our days and over time he began to flirt with me. He asked if I wanted to see any of his ""private pictures"". I said yes. I still have them. I can't believe Kyle would take pictures like that. I really can't believe I didn't delete them the second I saw what they were and end the whole thing

Yes. I took some nude photos of myself and sent them to him. I kept my face out of them of course. Even though I'm a bit skinnier and a lot taller than the girl whose image I used for my fake profiles he never questioned it. Instead he became even bolder and one thing led to another and we were having the dirtiest chat I'd ever experienced.

For weeks he begged to hear my voice. He constantly asked for my phone number but I told him I still didn't trust him enough to give away my personal information. One day he drew the line: if I wouldn't talk to him then he wasn't going to waste anymore time chatting with me.

We ended up using Google Chat. I kept my webcam aimed at my chest and made sure that I didn't show my face or hair. I also used my cutsey-little-voice and faked an accent (I had told him I was from Alabama for some reason). We began chatting like that all the time. The chats always led to him taking out his cock and him asking me to talk dirty to him. I watched Kyle

I kept wanting to end it. I really really did but I was addicted. It got so bad that I was standing up my boyfriend sometimes just so I could go home and sext with my brother. I didn't want to break his heart: I had created his perfect girlfriend. She liked all the things he liked

All of those lies worked for awhile. But they're not working anymore. He's demanding to meet me in person. Just tonight he sent me an e-mail in which he basically said that if I didn't leave my fictional

I don't know what to do. Obviously I can't meet him and I can't tell him the truth about who I am either. How would I explain that? My biggest worry is that he has figured out he's being toyed with. I mean

I feel really bad about this. Kyle is a good guy. It's just that what started off as a stupid little prank turned into a hole, I know, but I also need to figure out how to climb out of this hole without hurting Kyle or myself.

I'm married to a wonderful, she has a condition called vaginismus, which means that we can't have penetrative sex.

I am also scared to bring it up with her because I am afraid it would hurt her feelings... whenever we try to have penetrative sex and it hurts to much, she feels horrible, and I don't know how to comfort her.

I suppose the lack of sex got to me after a couple of years. I know, admiring them. Met a girl last semester, hung out with her a few times, smoked week, but I never made a move, just stayed friends. I met another girl, who was 19, and chatted her up quite a bit, before asking her out

Fast forward a few months and a new semester, so I ask her about it after class and she says, ""Oh, I was busy."" I know when I am being rejected, so I say okay and make plans to end it right there. Except, in my wacko head, I decide to do something else. I text her that we should be friends with benefits

Next week she says she will do it for the money, I park so that we can talk face to face about it. She ends up not wanting to do it, and I say goodbye, but then get mad and text her asking why she wasted my time, then I get mad at myself for being a fucking asshole/creep and text her I'll respect her decision and leave her alone.

I again confess everything to my wife and tell her she needs to divorce me. She tells me she loves me and that she won't give up on me. This woman is obviously way too good for an asshole like me.

A few weeks later I get another text. She says she has gone on a shopping spree for the first time in forever and spent all of her money and needs more to go on some trips this summer. A few days later I pick her up and take her to our apartment while my wife is at work. I say I am moving in and we have sex in a spare room on the floor- I hid everything that showed I was married, that she could see coming in. Afterwards I immediately felt like shit. I gave her $100 and drove home in silence. When I dropped her off it was a real movie moment, raining, empty parking lot, watching her walk back to her dorm, and I thought about the cute smile she had from a few months prior when we used to flirt--its not that I am in love with her or anything, but I felt like a total creepy ass fucking dick for actually coercing this girl with money into selling her body for sex. I just hope it doesn't leave her with issues for life.

I'm aware of how narcissistic and selfish my actions are. I'm also aware that I should tell my wife, but I also know that, at times, I'm a horny fuck. Also, this whole episode has brought out a side of me that I don't exactly like: domineering, coercive, manipulative. I'm aware that part of the decision was on her part, she isn't exactly that bright of a young girl

So here's what I've learned about how my best friend/lover has been doing since I skipped town for almost two years after cutting off contact with him and all of my other friends:  

I did talk to my brother a few nights ago and asked him casually what Nick had been up to

So yeah. That's what I've got to work with. Upon my disappearance, or out riding by himself. 

I don't even know what to do with that information. He sounds completely withdrawn. I mean, but that's some hardcore solitude even for him. At least he's not with anyone, so that's one thing I don't have to worry about.

In any case, I don't think it's fair to do it twice by just showing up out of nowhere. So I wrote this letter on quality paper, sealed with red wax, and I'm going to put it in overnight priority mail Monday in a separate envelope so I don't have to put his address on the actual letter itself, just his name. 

Here it is: 

**Nick

**I am the sorriest son of a bitch alive. I left because I was afraid

**I'm planning on a visit next weekend. I want to see you when I do

**I don't expect you to accept my apology based on one visit

~~**I'm putting my heart in your hands. You did the same for me once and I fucked it up big time. Here's your chance to get me back

~~**I still want us to honeymoon in Amsterdam and grow old with too many dogs and argue about what kind of movies to watch at night. Tell me you'll at least still consider it.**~~ 

~~**I love you, I don't give a damn who knows.**~~ 

**I'll come by and find you. Please don't turn me away when I do.** 

**I love you.**

**Tobias**

EDIT: Thanks for all the well wishes, less mushy. Post office is closed tomorrow anyway. 

EDIT2: Forgot to mention, so I wrote a letter and left it under his pillow. I was hoping seeing another one would bring up sweet memories for him of us.

I finally go to bed and wake up a few hours later to the sound of police cars, and my RA is saying that there has been an incident a few floors below us, and we couldn't leave until everything was sorted out.  The next day we discover that a girl on the seventh floor was beaten so badly that she had to go to the hospital by her ex-boyfriend. She had a restraining order against him. He apparently tried to choke her and rape her, but her roommate was able to keep him off. 

Immediately, but he pretty much just said that it was a mistake, and he would have probably gotten in anyway. He didn't blame me.

When I was a freshman in high school I made friends with many of the seniors and their friends who had graduated. I became very close to one guy in particular who I will call J.
J and I spent a lot of time together and he eventually told me he liked me. He was 19 at the time and I had a boyfriend. He flirted with me quite a bit

His attention to me died down for a while and I borrowed a case of his CDs to move to my iTunes during the summer. I texted him to let them know I was done with them and he came to pick them up. He walked 6 miles in the summer while I was home alone to pick them up.

When he got there, I told him to stop, I said don't (He would later tell me he thought I had said ""no don't stop"" and was enjoying it). He didn't until he heard a car door slam and assumed it was my mother.

It wasn't long before it got out. My best friend told everybody at her summer camp without my permission. My boyfriend and I started receiving emails

The man who would become my husband got roped in when my boyfriend went to my rapist's house and interrogated him and recorded the conversation, with the conversation still on it.

My mother told me that nobody would ever believe me and didn't take me to the doctor

Eventually, most of them thought I deserved it or thought I was lying.

It's been 8 years and I am still unable to have anal sex. I went to the movies to see Girl With The Dragon Tattoo before reading the book and I had a panic attack and had to leave during the rap and shower scenes. I have nightmares about it and scream at my husband when he touches my ass without my permission. I don't know if I will ever get over it.

1376068680.0,1k1bzt,Pretty much only slept with hookers,Seriouslyusernametkn,180,57,27,"Where do I begin? Firstly

In fact I've had sex with 5 girls during my teens

This story begins with a father and son. My mother and father divorced shortly after I was born, nor did I really love him either. Distance was always a big factor, he lived in another country.

I visited him infrequently, but another big South East Asian city). One school holidays when I was 18, I went over to spend some time with my Dad and one night he took me out to a KTV. It's similar to hostess bars in Japan, the focus is more on Karaoke and the intent is much more clear.

So we're in this small, the cute, petite girls who would do anything for you. 

Not these women. Oh god, and the kind of distinctly feminine figures that are so idolised manifest in the flesh. They were absolutely smoking hot. 

It seemed strange at first, and on the surface of things it seemed completely innocent. I knew Japanese history, I knew about Geishas!

So I sat down, smoked and drank and had a good time for about an hour.

After a while I started questioning the scenario a bit

....what?

I felt incredibly indignified by the whole thing. How could someone let themselves sink so low that they would *pay* for sex? All hookers are dirty, stinking fat man wants. Sex is free! Why would you need to pay for it? Why would you need to. I got up and procceeded to storm out the room, followed closely by the mistress and one of her entourage. 

""Are you angry? Come you let this girl give you blowjob"". The girl who followed her was in a tiny red sequined, probably early twenties if not younger and again, just absolutely gorgeous. I froze for a second, doubt creeped across my mind. Here's this incredibly attractive woman standing before me, nodding her head and agreeing that she would fufill any of my sexual desires.

No chance. My moral compass was too strict. Not today

""What are you

I walked out into the balmy night and was just angry at the whole situation. MY father was married

So I grabbed a cab and went back to his apartment. When I got there

What the fuck is wrong with everyone?!?! Christ this city is fucked! The inhabitants are all fucked is what they are.

Anyways, it was just plain and utterly pathetic to me. I felt he was pathetic for paying for sex.

We didn't visit the hostess bar again that trip.

Skip forward a couple of months, we were still all pretty thrilled with the idea that we can now drink, gamble, smoke (legally) and generally act like law-abiding adults. Afterwards, it struck me.

I don't know why, there was no doubt I would fuck the next living thing that approached me, I was so incredibly horny and the only thing that would satiete my libido was sex with a live woman. I started talking about it to my mates, and one of my more slightly experienced friends suggests we go to a brothel (brothels are legal where I live). 

OK fine

A host greeted us and ushered us into a lounge with a few TV's broadcasting a bad porno. The ladies came in one by one and introduced themselves. They were all fat, average looking and petite, she seemed willing so I took her. My mates didn't seem fussed and took the first girls that came. I paid the host, I took her off into a room and I fucked her.
No strings, I don't know why. To this day I still question why. Maybe it was the alcohol, maybe I was nervous, maybe it was the fact that I was doing the very thing I despised my father for doing. It didn't matter. I finished myself off and she didn't really have a problem with that. I left, went back to my friends house and got completely blazed.

Since then I went back to the same brothel I think three or four times in the same year.

After that, and most of my expectations were met with a very surreal reality.

I spent a few months working for my Dad and man
It was incredibly exclusive, a particular network open to particular people. Nothing criminal or shady, let's just leave it that there
are more powerful interests in this world

Again, it was every single girl you could imagine from every country in the world. This particular country (you could even call it a City, a State even) my Dad resides in is
incredibly notorious for offering very lucrative

Russians, Eastern Europeans. There's a lot of porn out there with these absolutely stunning beauties, uncovered hidden treasures that porn producers seem to attract. You don't see it as often these days, but you catch it sometimes from films in the early 00's 
and the late 90's. Girls who could

And there's a whole underground club full of them, media programmed sense of the word. These were professionals all smoking hot and young and by god were they god at what they did. I paid them well and they was barely any drama.

I would have sex with an Amazonian Brazillian Goddess one night
intense, genuinely surprised I haven't caught a single STD or STI. Fuck my only real regret was that I wasn't more safe about it. It was hard not to. I kept escalating. I started off just having sex with them, 
then one night I asked a 36-24-36 Latino if she would blow me without a condom. SHe was hesitant at first

My only fear, three guys a night, for two or three hours each.
Do the math. They *wanted* to come and why blame them? One particular woman I became friends with had managed to buy herself a half-million dollar apartment after only working for six months. Six months and she already had real estate. It wasn't just all from hooking either
from a few of her more attached customers.

The boundaries in relationships became completely blurred. I had to force myself not to get attached. As someone who considered himself a one girl type of guy

Anyways

At this point in the story

I haven't and still haven't been in an actual proper long term relationship. After this

Anyways, the girls were never quite as good. Most of them were old, weathered, seen one too many Johns. Most of them shouldn't have been there, and if it was any major
city in the world

Then shit came crashing down. My Mom died (Very quickly) of cancer, disgusting, bloody and painful.
I started failing at University, and comforted by the fact that I could be vulnerable and people held that in some kind of respect.
 
I took a trip to another Asian country, orderly and futuristic. I went on a quest, sspending time travelling around the country. The fucked up thing was, I spent so much time in these backpackers, hostels and other places, where the girls were all willing and completely ready to be taken.
But I never did. I didn't want to. I finally mustered up enough game to get a girl into bed

It was different. She was a living, someone who wanted to be loved. She jusst wanted sex too, there's no doubt in my mind. But something irrevocably changed within me. I could no longer live out my fantasies, it wasn't just a one person show anymore, and let's face it, up until this
point it was completely a one-person show. 

It's different when your with a prositute, and if there is, it's well scripted and rehearsed. They're subservient, they let you take control without having to claim it and most importantly, you know you are anonymous. It doesn't matter how or why you like what you like, there's no
emotional anchor there. It's sex and it's simply sex.

Anyways

Fast forward, I'm living in a sharehouse I don't want to be in (I got kicked out of my sisters house) I'm broke as fuck with no real networks in a town I really don't want to be in. 

I decided to go to a brothel a couple of months ago. There were no women I wanted to fuck, misshapen and a little gross. I fucked her anyway, because fuck, it doesn't matter how I feel right? All that matters is that I'm a guy who wants to fuck.
That's apparently the one thing that's ever mattered with sex. Guys are mindless fucking robots who just want to have sex

It was an awkward and weird experience. For the first time in my life I realised it wasn't all about sex. And here I was trying to make myself cum to this old
I needed to fufill that fantasy

I felt dirty, not a single thing wrong with me. For a few weeks it felt like there was something terribly wrong. It was
probably less to do with the sex

So there you have it. In the course of 8 years I've slept with about 50 women, if even that one person that's gotten to the end of this post.

The thing that makes me the most angry is, my earliest 'clear' memories are of this. These events are what I remember of my childhood. fuck.


One last thing


I am a mid twenties white male


I grew up in a really small town outside of detroit. One stoplight


I had a couple friends when I was little, a new family moved into the neighborhood. They had a son, who became the 'cool older kid'.IIRC, he was 13 when we started being friends. I only remember that I was six years old because I remember having a birthday party a few weeks prior with a big obnoxious 6 in icing. I wanted donuts instead of cake. I was disapoint.


He and I hung out constantly and did random destructive shit together in the woods and whatnot. My parents didn't care very much because he was older and I guess seemed trustworthy. Even looking back as an adult, sports, and all that. 

We had been friends for what I would estimate a couple weeks when we were wandering around in the woods close to my house.

The conversation is very vague to me because it's been so long

He gave the best description he could on the topics about how what boys did to girls when they were older. He started talking nonstop about how incredibly good it felt. I didn't have a fucking clue what he was talking about


I remember feeling  uncomfortable with what he was talking about, I wanted to be cool too. 


I tried to keep up with his one-sided conversation about sex. For some reason, much less understood at all. I remember hearing the word ""pussy"" and thinking it was such a dirty sounding name for a body part. It's weird how such a dumb word can stick to a persons memory for all these years. It was my first real exposure to that side of the world.


Maybe a week later



He had been talking more and more about what I considered ""dirty stuff"". Stuff that I really had no desire to talk about


  We ended up in the backseat of the car shooting at the imaginary robbers.

This is part I warned you not to read.

This old Oldsmobile had folding back seats that opened into the trunk. I remember as I was shooting at imaginary robbers, he pulls down the folding backseat and suggests we take cover in the trunk for a while to hang out. I was in the heat of the moment, trying to save my money from robbers, we climb in, and it is not a large trunk. 


Completely off the topic of this epic firefight that we were involved in


I remember him grabbing my shoulders, and he started sort of rubbing/dryhumping me.  The amount of weird going on in my 6 year old mind was off the charts. My young mind had just assumed this was some kind of normality. That part is sketchy, I'm sure I could have wriggled out of there and told an adult, but I didn't. I was sure that I would get in trouble for this sort of thing.  I wanted to impress my new friend, and I was definitely not clear on what was going on here. I had figured out that is was some kind of adult thing. Being six years old was crazy. 

When he finally pulled off of my face, and if that made us ""gay"". I was shocked from what just happened, and slightly disgusted. He heard the digust in my voice, and it was the first of many times I saw his anger.

His face told me that I had insulted him, we are just practicing for girls. Its our secret that you can't tell anyone"". I blindly believe him, because to me, he's the cool, smart older kid who wanted to be my friend. 

A few days later, I'll show you mine"" type of thing, at his suggestion.

I was so fucking confused at that moment. I knew this was all wrong, ""our secret"" ect. I started to refuse. I was too embarrassed. 


Thats when the threats started. Blackmail really. He berated me

The next he came over it was easier for him to get to the perverted goal of his, I protested for second, then thought better of it.I knew he would probably start asking and begging until resorted to threats. At this point, we had't done anything too sexual with each other, but I already had the vibe that he was kind of sketchy, I knew to fear this kid.


the whole day he kept making weird comments about how he was going to make me feel good, and my parents trusted him), and he got me alone. We went swimming for a while, then inside to play video games. He tried positive reinforcement and bribes to get me naked didn't work, he pulled out his trusted threatdown, which worked. I felt so embarassed while I was pulling down my pants in front of someone. I knew this was wrong. I had my eyes closed because I was so humiliated. I stood there for a few seconds, eyes still squinted shut, saw what was happening. He proceeded to give me oral. I had no idea what he was doing, ""your turn"". I realized what he was asking me to do, even though I knew it was wrong. A part of me is very scared

I said ""do I have to""?  He got pretty mad and calling me names and threatening to tell on me. I plead with him for him not to tell my parents.I start crying, or shocked. He was still kind of underdeveloped, but definitetly bigger than me, and had started to grow pubic hair. He gripped the back of my head and forced me onto him. He didn't let go of my hair the whole time, i was trying to cry or say stop but he just went in as far as he could, starting to choke me. He yells that I bit him. More threats. 

After telling me stop crying, I felt him swell up and pulse in me, followed by him forcing himself all the way in, choking me and sending body fluids out of my nose. I will never forget the smug fucking look on his face when that happened. His mood changed instantly after orgasm. He would be not such an asshole to me, occasionally even said sorry, or showed some remorse. This never lasted though. 

For the next two years, and easily the hardest to admit, is that sometimes, he performed oral sex on me, and being that young, I couldnt stop the physical response. I still feel like I deserved it, because I slightly enjoyed that part of our encounters. I hated the rest.


 I started hating the sight of seeing him coming up the front steps to my house, other than stopping at my house for ten or fifteen minutes a couple times a week, getting what he came for and leaving.


I still told myself that I had iniated this. I reminded myself that he treatened to ""out me"" in front of all my friends and parents. I was fucking terrified most of the time. After he left my house


It still got worse though. He came over to play a N64 game or something. My parents left for the grocery store, ect ect.


After my parents leave

He made me lay naked on the floor

He tried unsuccessfully for what seemed like hours to get himself to fit into me

I was 8 at this time and he was 15.

It did not stop him from trying, and tried to hulksmash his way into my body. Intense pain. I pull away super quick. I'm still crying and begging and clutching the now damaged bit of my brown eye. He struck me with an open fist and told me to quit crying. He said he was sorry after he was done about 5 minutes later.He tried to ""make up for it"" but I was enormously shaken up by getting hit. 

He tried this for about a month

He traumatized my nethers until i was sure I was going to die. He would force me to give him oral for a few days until I healed up. 


He was your classic predator. He made promises
I honestly thought that I would go to jail for this. 


This continuted until I moved out of state when I was 11. I always had what happened in the back of my mind, this is the first time I've even talked about it. Nobody knows about it, it will stay that way, hopefully. While drunk, I almost told my SO, but I couldnt get the words out.

It wasn't until I was around 21 or 22, violently, hundreds of times over the span of four years. Luckily no permanent injuries or scars.

It's also very clear to me now that he was probably abused in the exact same manner that I was. I still hate him for it.


TL;DR   I spent my childhood being used as a cum rag by a teenage boy who was probably abused himself

Drunk while proof read and submitted so format and spelling are fucked.

I'll keep this throwaway active for a few days in the spirit of the mythical ""delivering OP"".

1367685615.0,1doncj,My high school boyfriend died and I don't care.,GreenxRina,262,136,93,"A little backstory

He was madly in love with me. Wanted to get married, in my mind I knew I was never happy with him but he was the best I was ever going to do because I felt stuck forever. I went along with and even came up with future scenarios in our romance. Everyone encouraged us to be together because we ""worked so well as a couple."" My friends loved him, my mother, everyone. He was a genuinely good, loving and helpful person.

Over the course of our relationship there were a lot of firsts. He lost his virginity. I learned how to cheat on a partner. He found his first love. I learned how to lie really well. I know, far away to my magical dream college and live a new life in some awesome city. I worked my tail off to have a stellar record to do so. During our time together, Dave convinced me that he couldn't possibly live without me. Out of guilt, unwanted heartbreak, uncertainty of the future he managed to make me compromise my dreams around 3 times until I wound up agreeing to go to a school just an hour drive away.

Graduation rolled around and I spent the summer with some family in another state. There I met a ton of new people. I looked at life a total different way and grew more in those couple months than I ever did in my small town. I realized I didn't have to damn myself to a life of ""settling."" I didn't feel smothered anymore by the prospect of my future. No isolated farm life

After we officially were apart, telling me things like ""I have to think about you when I sleep with my girlfriend so I can get off. Please don't tell anyone."" and that he will never get over me etc. Even 4 years down the line, someone asked where I was at a party and Dave's brother shushed that person making sure Dave didn't even hear my name mentioned because he ""doesn't want to take Dave down that road again.""

Fastforward to recently, haven't gone back in I think around 10 years. He never crosses my mind, yet since we dated for so long, everyone expected me to be heartbroken. They only remember Dave dwelling on me so much, for so long that's the image they have of me. A girl, frozen in time, still around Dave and living in their world. They expected a reaction like theirs. In reality, he died

I guess that sort of makes me sound really heartless. I look like the demon cheater with no respect for the dead but honestly he was just a blip in the radar of an otherwise super exciting, that sucks, oh well.


**TL;DR I treated a faithful

**Edit:** Adding some facts for clarification. He died 10 years after us being together. Not a week later. Not a year. He had ample time to move on but
This relationship took place -during- high school. We weren't adults and didn't live together. I did not bone a bunch of dudes behind his back

**Edit 2:** I did not go on to live of life of no feeling, hounding me to get back together, making sure he was constantly around every where I went. That and the endless hours and hours of weeping, fighting, yelling and begging phone calls and talks he pushed on me wanting to get back together. I left this out before, but looking at the replies made me change my decision to leave it out.

NOTE: I did not include how much pressure he put on me to get married. How the house his parents bought was HIS plan (I had no inkling of it.) and was given to me in a very public way. Along with other expensive, and if not--that's not right fuck her. I was horrified at the increasing obligation I felt to stay with him. When I'd say I wanted to leave, to my friends, they'd scoff and say how ""good"" I had it and that I should just stay because it was the right thing to do given how much he ""invested"" in me. Even my mom yelled at me once for telling her I didn't want to be with him anymore. I was timid back then and was raised that the man/parent is always right, that's just how people are in corn country. I know that's not an excuse, but that doesn't change the fact it's the mindset I was raised in and I 100% believed there would be some kind of dire consequence of leaving him.

My puppy girl is slowly getting back to normal! She had developped a rash during the ordeal, and I definitely learned my lesson. Ugh what a godawful few days that was. THANK YOU SO MUCH, to everyone who replied. When I was feeling the worst about it, thinking she'd never recover, I would read what y'all were saying and it made me feel a little less like an asshole dickfucking douchewaffle... and more like an average idiot screwup (which really makes a difference when you're the one who has to feel that way)

Thanks

~~

i stayed up all night with the dog last night. It was really terrifying, and I go and leave a bowl of weed cookies open on the counter while I take a shit. I'm such a fucking idiot. The dog barfed it up but was still spasming and freaking out all night and I was fucking terrified. 

I spent the night in my dads empty house (he's selling it soon) just hoping she'll be alright and calming her down. She wasn't really herself today at all

So I'm still tending her at like 6 pm when I hear a knock at the door. I was eating some pizza and petting my PTSD puppy and opened the door and saw the realtor with a whole family staring at me. ""umm... we BOOKED this time to view the house....."" she said

So she comes home and sees this dog and flips her shit - ""What have you done to my baby, what is wrong with her, call the pet emergency clinic, etc""

We get there and they ask questions and I sit there feeling like a pile of fucking rotten shit as I lie and say she got like this after a walk in the woods where I lost sight of her for a bit. I told them about the barf and the symptoms and the timeline was the same

So as we're sitting there waiting for the basic bloodwork to be done, and tbh I'm kinda glad because I'm worried that she'll never be the same... I'm such a dickhead... I deserve worse than debt. She is an innocent baby, and I am never going to smoke or consume weed ever again. This is fucked up. I love that dog more than my whole life. I'm an idiot. That's my confession.

 **TL;DR ~ Dog ate cookies, mum freaked and took her to vet, I made shit up, I paid the cost of the bills, I deserve worse, I hope my dog's okay.**",,,,

My mother recently started dating a black man who refuses to even look for a job. He doesn't have a driver's license, his drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, puts a roof over his head, takes him on spending sprees for hideous clothes that don't fit him, etc. She's behind on her bills because she gives him all of her money and she drives him around everywhere and gives him money like he's a little kid. He sounds really unintelligent when he speaks.

He hits her. She's always covered in bruises, and back. One time he pushed her in front of a moving car. She's starting to talk like him. She refers to women as ""bitches"" and started using really bad grammar on purpose to sound ""cool"". She only listens to shitty radio radio rap. She's always been an alcoholic but she's drinking more than ever and she's started doing coke as well. I feel like I'm watching her throw her life away for this leech of a person. He's threatened to kill her and me. I've called the police before. They say she won't admit to him ever hitting her or threatening either of us and that there's nothing they can do because she refuses to press charges.

He cheats on her with ugly white women.

He has a child who he actively pretended to take care of for over a year. My mom mentioned that she's never seen his kid before. I told her how weird that was. Turns out, ugly white lady in another state and never sees it.

He told her that his dad died and confessed to my mom how much he hated that he couldn't make it to his funeral because he didn't have money for a plane ticket even though it was only a few hundred dollars. About two months later, without a license, with drugs on him, then failing to appear in court twice. When he was in jail, my mom had his cell phone. His dad called his cell phone. His ""dead"" dad.

He steals things from her house

Like I said, but I think horribly racist things about this man. He got in my face and called me names once and I got so mad and I didn't even know what to say that I called him a nigger. I've thought it for a long time and I still think of him as a nigger sometimes. I guess it's not so much racism against black women, mostly just the men who take no pride in their appearance and dress like wannabe rappers from the 90s. Not the educated ones or anything. But now I assume that black men who dress and act like he does are useless, bad people. A hindrance to society. 

My friends don't know. My boyfriend doesn't know. He's liberal and an extreme political activist. I don't think he'd date me anymore if he found out. I'm embarrassed. But I hate my mom's boyfriend.

Eventually Jessica and her ex reconnected and started dating.  Nothing very serious, and would stay up all night chatting away long past when everyone else was passed out drunk.  

I eventually developed feelings for her

One night she came over to hang out and watch tv at my place (Which is something we had done dozens of times before).  We had a few drinks and both eventually fell asleep on my couch.  I woke up at some point and went to my bedroom.  At some point in the night she came into my room and asked if she could sleep on my bed, but I just could not stand it for one second longer, so I made a move and kissed her.  She didn't try to stop it, one thing led to another, and we had sex.   Honestly, it was amazing.. probably the best sex of my life.  In addition to that we talked and shared so much about our mutual feelings for each other that had always gone unsaid.  We stayed up until long after the sun had risen.  I wanted that night to last forever, but eventually she had to leave.  I'll never forget her telling me, back to reality now.""  It made me incredibly sad realizing how true that was.

We talked about our options after that, but I could never turn her down when she wanted to hang out.  And when we hung out, sometimes sex would ensue.

Eventually her 'dating' my friend turned into a real relationship.  I found out via a Facebook post, and so blind to everything concerning this girl that I truly believed things would work out in my favor.  

At this point in time Jessica lived with her parents.  Her dad is a bad person and she was not happy there.  We had often talked about how cool it would be to live together before, so to this day I have never charged her rent or asked her to help me financially with anything.  She made up some excuse about her dad kicking her out and having no where else to go.  She told her boyfriend that she had asked me and I agreed.  Her boyfriend lives with his parents too, so he wasn't upset about it, and even helped her move in.

There continued to be a few times after Jessica moved in that we slept together, but there is certainly a lack of privacy for her.  Anyways, one day I came home and walked in on her and her boyfriend having sex.  

I think that's when I lost it.  Of course I always realized that she was sleeping with him too, and from then on we have never slept together again.  It felt a lot like a break-up.

It's been about a year and a half since the beginning of these events and Jessica still lives with me.  My feelings for her have not diminished in the slightest.  I truly do love her.  The only thing that time has done is to make my feelings for her stronger.  I feel that sort of unconditional love that you have for family, throwing away every friendship I have would be worth it to spend my life with her.  But I realize that will not happen.  She has made her choice.  At the same time I have realized that I cannot continue living with her if I ever hope to move on with my life and give myself a chance for happiness with someone else.  So I recently asked her to move out.  The discussion went amicably and she agreed it was for the best.  I gave her 3 months to find another place.  I sincerely hope that I will be able to move on.  I can't imagine feeling like this for another year, let alone the rest of my life.  I am in a constant state of sadness.  Suicide is a temptress that I often toy with.  I hope that all changes when she moves out.

I mainly sold marijuana

I was slowing down my dealing. I didn't realize it at the time but the gradually decreasing number of sales I had been engaging in would eventually lead to no sales at all. My customer base had been slowly disappearing because I was lazy and pretty unreliable

Before I decided to quit, we can call her Sarah. (Not her real name)

Sarah, starting with 3 pills a week, all the way up to two a day. For a month or two, she was buying 2 pills off of me every day. She lived 3 blocks away and we both had cars anyways so meeting was never a problem.

The day ""it happened"", because it was extended release (the amphetamines release into your body initially when you take it and again four hours later) instead of instant.

We had always had a flirty, when she'd hug me her boobs would always end up pressed up against my chest so I could see her cleavage, she'd always wear the most revealing clothes around me, she'd always smile at me and say ""hi its_just_a_ride"", emphasizing my name in a sexual way, etc. Keep in mind that even though she was acting as if she had interest in me, it was completely because of the drugs. I'd sometimes give her an extra pill or two, I felt fake alot of the time

So we're in her house, but I walked with her out to her car. I was behind her. I remember watching her ass as we walked down the front porch steps to her car. She had been a bit too thick for my tastes before she started the Adderall but it had made her lose a few pounds and I was noticing how she was so fucking sexy now. She was a bit thick (she wasn't bone thin but certainly not at all overweight) and because of that she had a really, really nice, round ass and really nice boobs. I know, I know, I'm a disgusting, objectifying, she smelled so flowery and feminine. She opened her car door and leaned inside

She can't find the money so we go inside to look in her room one last time. She asks if she can just have the Adderall because she's a loyal customer. I told her I would but I had to profit if I wanted to keep dealing, ""I- I'll give you head for 25 pills."" I only had 60 and said no because I thought that would be a huge hit to my finances. But I realized if I just smoked less weed every day for a week I could sell what I didn't smoke and get my money back. So I said yeah, and she instantly got on her knees and started going to town.

It was an amazing blowjob, but I was still horny so I told her she could have the rest of my pills if she fucked me. She didn't hesitate at all. She lead me upstairs and I fucked her doggystyle. I lasted way longer than I expected (probably because I had just gotten blown) even though I was staring at her ass the whole time we fucked. It was bouncing up and down and shit. So fucking hot.

I busted and we smoked another cig each. I told her before I left I'd give her double what I had just given her if she let me fuck her up the ass someday. I know many of you think it's disgusting, she told me she never had done anal and never wanted to. So we go our separate ways.

I sold for a month or two after that but she never tried to buy anything off of me again. At the time, I feel bad because A) she was addicted to Aderall and I was her only connect, and she STILL didn't want to buy from me, because (I think) she was uncomfortable and thought she'd end up fucking me again for more drugs. B) I realize that she had no attraction to me and probably didn't even like it, but at the time I felt really shitty about everything and it felt really good to pretend that someone wanted to fuck me.

It began in my teens.  We played video games, we got drunk together.  I always admired my dad for being the man he is, and he stood by me no matter what I chose.  And when I decided to leave school to become a chef, he stood beside me.

One night we had arrived home from dinner together.  We were on the couch talking, maybe the conversation we were having.  The way he looked at me... just something inside me made me want to kiss him.  Not thinking I went for it.  I just did it.  He didn't stop me, infact he held the back of my head and kept me there.  

That was the first incident.  We stopped, we seemed to be more close.

The next time we were having dinner and came home

The next day, we were lovers.  And when I got out of the bed, my heart broke because I was leaving him to go back to my own room.

After that night, but we walk around the city holding hands, at work my colleagues know him as my partner.  And the fact that we have the same last name, people assume we are married.  No one asks how we met.  I guess though if anyone asked, we would most likely lie and make something up.

On the outside

I'm not ashamed.  I love him.  He's my dad.

But I had to make this confession.

My Wife worked part time, which she did.

The attention she began receiving from other men online filled the gaps in the lack of attention I was providing her and so things progressed. Once I figured out what was going on, it was always an online thing (to my knowledge). She is not computer savvy, so my ""tracking"" was always undetected. When things slowed down in her online world, I decided to light the flame again...

I began creating online personas to interact with her online and see how far I could push things. What I could get her to do that maybe she wasn't vocal with me about. Things she liked

I married her Mom when I was 29 and she was 8. In total I have 4 Step-children aged 16, but I will preface it to say that no

My wife and I are very over protective of our children, #1 of 394 students in her class for 3 years straight, etc. etc. etc. Kay on the other hand is the exact opposite. Rebellious, selfish, talks back, can't be counted on to do anything, constantly lies

When we started allowing them to go online I installed a spyware program on the computer in order to monitor their internet activity without their knowledge. Kay repeatedly created Facebook accounts without our permission and against our rules and tried to hide them from us, she was very careful about what she said on the computer while at home because she knew about the software. Kay never talks to her Mother or me about anything going on in her life, everything is a huge secret and we never now anything that she does or says.

I got a stupid idea to create a fake girl online in order to become her friend and hopefully get some insight into what was going on in her life that she kept so secret from us. I know

So I made friends with Kay and started talking to her and it was going ok for awhile. After about 6 months she started to suspect something was fishy and in order to ""save myself"" I created another person (the fake girl's cousin) and introduced them. Kay had had 2 serious crushes on boys that happened to have the same name (we'll say Josh)

Kay is VERY starved for attention because she is always in trouble at home because of the things that she does

As it was bound to happen I got caught by my wife.  She had gone through my phone and found the email accounts I had made.  She was beyond pissed

She now hates me, she certainly should have in order to protect her daughter.  My relationship with Kay has been utterly destroyed and I have no hope of ever repairing it, and I don't deserve to have it repaired either.  I am extremely attracted to her and find myself watching her and fantasizing about her in ways that no grown man should.  It's just her though, I don't think of any other underaged people like this and I don't know what to do.

He mostly does it when I'm half-asleep in the morning...he'll start by rubbing my back (which I think is a fairly normal parental thing to do...except he'll unclasp my bra), or I feel bad

One time he asked me if I thought he was creepy. I didn't say anything, ""I'm a terrible father""; I just kind of knew what he meant but I asked him why. I was really uncomfortable and not completely listening, but he said something around the lines of, ""I'm probably confusing you"" (I think I nodded). Then he said something close to, ""I just like rubbing you."" Then I stood up and said I was going to go back to the hotel and he asked if I wanted to talk about it. I said, ""No. Thanks for saying sorry."" Then went back up to our room. 

He still touches me. He'll give me a back rub, but I was so uncomfortable and mad and ashamed...and the thing is, I can't ever tell anyone about it. I love my dad to death and overall he probably has the best moral compass of anyone I've ever known. If I told it would destroy our family and his life.

So my cousin and I went out to the bar on Saturday night with some mutual friends, just a group of friends hanging out.

We get back to my place around 3am and he asks if I have any more booze in the house

I walk back into the room and hes in just his boxers turning on the xbox and im just naked toweling off and I made a joke about something that happened at the bar. He looked over at me and said something like ""dude your dick is so much bigger than mine!"" This is so not true, see""

We stands up and whips it out standing right up close to me and then we kinda held them out towards each other to compasre side by side.

We both got hard

It was really the strangest and best experience of my life. We're both over 190cm and 90kg rugby players, I'd say probably 195cm and close to 100kg) but we started making out and before I knew it I was fucking him. I fucked my own cousin in the ass. I'd never even done anal with a girl before. 

It only lasted a couple minutes and we both came and slept in the bed together naked

I broke up with my girlfriend on Monday not because I think that I'm gay or anything but just because I am pretty sure that I am in love with him and I have no idea what to do and it isnt fair to her to stay with her after I cheated.

I told 2 friends about it because I had told them about ""her"" beforehand.  

Finally in late December he recontacted me and told me the truth.  I didn't believe it at first because he had such a good story.  He had access to her real Facebook

We did things like show each other our rooms.  So there were pictures of his sister in front of objects he showed me without her.  We even voice chatted

There are some other things, but I snooped, and it further cemented in my mind that she was real.  Messages going back many years to people that she had on her Facebook friends.  He told me later that she abandoned that email address so he just took over.

My friends asked me ""why didn't you ever video chat?""  Well there's an easy answer there.  It was literally impossible for ""her"".  As we know

1337752581.0,u0mpu,I just got back from a stripclub... where my sister works. And she doesn't know I was there. ama if you want,iamgoing2hell,146,24,47,"Man I'm in a real shame spiral right now. I cannot believe I did that. I can't believe how awesome it was. I mean how sick it was. I mean how horrible I am. I mean how amped up I feel right now. Shit! This is easily the single most disgusting thing I've ever done in my life. Isn't it? I don't know. Fuck fuck fuckfuckfuckfuck.

Okay the backstory. I recently moved back home from college cause even though I'd like to I can't afford to stay on campus during the summer

Now I knew the name of the stripclub though I've never been there. It's this really sketchy looking place near the airport that I've driven past many

Then I got to thinking about it and it occurred to me that she had quite a few expensive things for a part-time waitress at Chain Restaurant and full time community college student. And she definitely is a full-time student. Unless she's playing a huge con with made up fb updates, she's definitely in school and definitely working at Chain Restaurant. But how could she afford the latest iPad, the iPhone, her mac computer, her used (but really nice, hella lot nicer than mine) car? Does commuting to college year round really save you THAT much money? I mean, fuck! I work when I'm at school and I can't afford shit.

Well after awhile it occurred to me that I should search for STRIPCLUB on facebook. And whatta ya know, bad stereotype stripper name tho). I clicked on her profile and there was only one picture of her there but lots and lots of status updates. In the picture she was wearing a ridiculous wig but it was definitely her.

Now after this discovery I almost came to reddit to ask for advice: what should I do?? But I knew what the hivemind would decide: talk to her about it or just leave it alone. There wasn't much chance the top voted comment would be a well thought explanation for why I should go to the stripclub and have a look and that's definitely what I wanted to do. So I gave reddit the finger and made a plan.

First I made sure she'd be working. On her fb alt-page I saw that she always mentioned when she'd be at Stripclub. Sure enough

This place is sleazy fellas. For my 21 birthday my buddies brought me to one near campus that was honestly pretty classy. If I didn't have a girlfriend I would probably have gone back many times cause the women were hot and the atmosphere was upbeat... but I do have a girlfriend and one of my presents for my 21st was her letting me go to a stripclub. Well anyway

They ID'd me at the door and once I was inside I kept glancing around, one main one) and ordered a beer.

After about ten minutes the announcer did his “everyoneputyourhandstogetherfor TRIXIE!” voice and whoa, a little bikini, and stilettos. She wasn't wearing a wig like she had in her fb profile picture either and it was definitely definitely her. I watched her dance and eventually strip and well boing. Yeah that happened. Watching sis spin around that pole topless and crawl over to strange men to have them slide dollar bills into her skimpy little g-string was a huge turn on. When her “set” was over I watched her take this douchy looking guy toward the “backroom” for a private dance (I already knew all about it cause I'd been asked by at least three other dancers already if I wanted a private dance).

Originally I meant to only see if it was really her and maybe have a little peek but man

That's when I realized I was too fucked up to drive. I asked the bartender if she could call me a cab and to my surprise she said they worked with an even better service that would drive me home in my own car! I'd never heard of anything like that. A drink later the dude arrived, especially at a stripclub.

That was my night, and wavering between feeling horny as fuck and miserable as fuck all. Shame and guilt at one moment, “that was fucking sweet” the next. Am I fucked up? I mean if a woman wants to strip, I don't give a shit. I don't think less of them. Never known a stripper before but fuck, I wouldn't judge someone who said that's what they did. I don't judge my sister! But for me to intentionally go and sort of spy on my sister while she did her thing... that's creepy. Isn't it?

So, he called me and apologized profusely. Said that he didn't mean any of it, that he loved me so much and that I was the most amazing girl in the world in every way. And like I am, I fell back into his arms because I was scared and lonely, and I missed him. He stayed at my place for the rest of the week.

About a week later we got into another fight because I had sent him a text and called him once while he was out with friends. After a lengthy fight over the phone, but he let himself in the building and by the time he was at my door I just let him in. It was pretty obvious that he was infuriated, he kept calling me a slut, a psycho bitch, the usual. He came out from the bedroom after getting the textbook he had left there, and I was standing near the door asking him to just calm down and talk to me. He then grabbed the back of my neck and pinned me down to the ground (some wresting move that he knew, he's really strong). He pinned my arms behind my back and pressed my face into the floor while twisting my arm. I tried to scratch him and I think I ripped his shirt trying to get him off me. Every time I tried to get up he would do it again. After I finally got up he pushed me hard enough for me to fall and the left.

Holy shit, and generally treated me like I was making shit up. I guess not surprising, considering I live in a state notoriously bad in dealing with domestic violence. The case was dismissed the day after. Apparently, all they did was call him, and all he had to do was tell them I was blocking his path and that was all the evidence they needed to close the case against him. I honestly don't get it. I don't understand why they would take his word against mine, even though I had the injuries. I don't understand how, even if that was the case (which it wasn't), he called my mom a few hours afterward and tried telling her a completely different story. He also tried to tell her that I was going to kill myself and tried to convince her to call the cops. I have absolutely not threatened to end my own life or harm myself in any way. You guys were right

So I sought a restraining order against him. I was granted a temporary order, there's not a whole lot of evidence of him doing anything wrong. I'm afraid of being in the same room with him, I'm afraid of what he'll say. I'm afraid that he'll tell more lies and they'll believe him over me. I'm afraid I won't get the restraining order, and I'll look like a fool. I'm afraid that if I lose, he'll do something worse in retaliation. I feel like it might be better if I just don't show up, so I at least don't make him angry. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid I'll be labeled a crazy liar. 

But no matter what happens with the restraining order, without that support, it's very likely I wouldn't have reported to assault, and that I would still be in the cycle of abuse. 

TL;DR: About a week after the incident I talked about in the previous thread, but haven't had the hearing to get the permanent one yet. I'm terrified of going to the hearing, and am considering not going because I don't know if I even have a shot. I'm so afraid of being labeled a liar. But I owe a huge thank you to all the people who gave me advice in the last thread, because it really motivated me to get out. I haven't spoken to him since the incident, which I guess was only a week and a half ago, but it feels like forever. It's been hard, but going this long without going back to him is unprecedented, and I absolutely will not fall in to that trap again.

I've been with the same woman for a decade.  She saved me from a very dark time in my life, we go to the same concerts, watch the same movies and even play the same video games.  We also share the same massive group of friends. She has always had a brash, cold exterior at times and can be very blunt with her honesty.  Me on the other hand, I am more sensitive, heart-on-my-sleeve.  She's very sharp, has a good memory and is very organized.  I am clumsy, but I was able to shutdown my own shit and be there for her for a good year or so.  One day she had a revelation.  ""I treat people like shit"", wonderful times.  
  
  The night before she left for vacation she went out with some co-workers.  I wanted her to come back and hang out with me, hoping and praying that she was safe.  2am was approaching.  She's never done this before, but she's drunk and possibly alone, and she leaves for a huge trip early in the morning.  My fear and paranoia increased.  I kept fearing she was hurt or got into an accident.  I double-called every 10 minutes, hoping she would hear my phone.  Finally, she calls after 3am.  Said she was too drunk to look at her phone and needed to rest in her car.  I yelled at her, told her ""at least tell me you are safe when it's after 2am"".  She got home ok though
  
She left the next day.  It was a planned vacation with family, that she treats me horribly.  ""I'm a cunt to you and you don't deserve it.  I'm awful to you but you never put me in my place"", she concluded saying maybe we are just better as friends.  After all, that's how we started...I told her to ""stop"".  I told her ""let's make a decision when you get back"".  I spent the next or so talking to a few close friends, who agreed ""there is no victim here"".  I refused to say a bad thing about her.  I was hurt but I couldn't fault her.  
  
She got home and things were weird.  We seldom addressed the issue beyond her occasionally saying ""I still don't know what I want"".  I started to think that maybe we should live in different places while we figure things out.  She was ""fine just hanging out"" but it hurt me too much to be around her all the time.  It hurt more and more.  I started talking long walks home and crying to myself because I couldn't allow myself to break down in front of anyone else.  

  
Here's where it gets weird.  She started talking to me about a co-worker every single day.  A co-worker who is in his 40's and used to be friendly with her but now won't talk to her because she's ""too liberal"". Every day she told me and our friends how big of a jerk he is, why?"".  ""Oh nothing"", she said.  ""My friend said something funny but I accidentally deleted it"".  I sat her down and looked her in the eye.  ""I need to ask you something.  Has anything ever happened between you and anyone else?  We've been together for a decade and I've never doubted you but please just answer me.  Things are weird right now but if something happened, just tell me.  I'll be hurt but we'll figure it out.  I won't flip out.  You can keep the dog, you still live here, we'll figure it out.  I just need to truth.  It's important.""  She looked me in the eyes and laughed ""No, of course not.  I promise.  Nothing has ever happened.""  I reminded her that this is the time to tell me and that it was just important to have her honesty.  She repeated her answer ""No.  There's no one else.  I promise.""  Fine.  I believed her.  I shut off my paranoia.
  
The weeks went on.  I called her one day, apologize, then make them again"".  Hold up.  I'm aware this is a fault of mine but what happened to the person who called me over the phone to put us on a break?  She was acting like that never happened.  ""You think that people aren't allowed to be mad at you, that they need to walk on eggshells"".  ""No"", I said, ""you have a right to be mad...but being mad doesn't give you a free pass to chew into someone for 20 minutes without a breath, calling them names like idiot, child
  
The following weekend she calls me while I'm at a friends house.  ""I have something to confess.  I developed a crush on Chris (co-worker).  He was checking me out a lot and I was flattered.  That night when I didn't come home...I had a few drinks in me.  We kissed a bunch.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  We kissed.  I told him it was weird for me because I had a boyfriend.  and now I know how much of a jerk he is
  
 I was in shock.  In 10 years
  
""You're not a bad person."" I told her.  I don't know why but it was my first thought.  ""I just can't believe it.  You kept it from me.  Then you lied to me when I asked you"".  ""I didn't think he was worth it because he was such a jerk.  Please don't throw away 10 years of our relationship.""  She starts crying.  ""Please listen"".  I listened.  I wanted to throw up but she spent 40 minutes telling me the story of how she realized he is a jerk.  ""It doesn't matter that he's a jerk.  There's a bigger issue here.""  ""I don't want you to think we went on break over him""
  
The next night she texts me that when I have kept things from her in the past
  
Another night goes by.  Once again, thinking that people aren't allowed to be mad at you.  Be a man.  Stop texting like a fucking teenager and call me.""  I called her but I was crying hysterically.  She accused me of ""playing the victim card"".  It's been 2 days since she confessed.  ""You've been playing the victim for ten years, ever since your parents deserted you"".  I said ""this conversation is over!"" and hung up.  She said the most hurtful thing she could possibly think of.

It was innocent for a long time until I started getting attention from guys on the site who told me I was hot and wanted to see more. Being a lonely 14 year old girl and loving the attention

Well, one of the guys sent me a link to a website where my videos were posted. He told me he found my myspace because it was linked to the same email and he was going to send the link of the website to all of my friends and family if I didn't continue to do private shows for him. Luckily, being 14, I had one of those whore accounts on myspace where you just try to get as many friends as you can, and the email address linked to my webcam account was not the same email I used for my personal myspace account. So fortunately I was able to block him with none of my friends or family seeing these incriminating videos. I was terrified so I deleted the account just as a precaution. I never did another video again. I thought it was all over with and had forgotten about it and told myself the videos of me probably didn't make it far on the internet...until last summer.

I'm almost 21 now, mortified. They told me they had found a couple of videos of me that have widely circulated the internet and had made multiple arrests because older men were watching the videos of me. They asked me if I would like to verify if it was me in the videos (which they had copied onto a DVD) but I said no because I was sure it was. They knew everything about me. Where I lived, where I work, the names of everyone in my family, and they even had a copy of my old myspace page. They told me I wasn't in any trouble and just wanted to know where the computer was that I made the videos on to confiscate it and make sure there were no more, but my family had already thrown it out.

So now there are multiple videos of 14-year-old me circulating on porn sites all over the internet. Every day I wonder if anyone has ever noticed me as the teen girl they saw in a video once. I wonder if my guy friends or guys I went to high school with have seen it or will see it. I am constantly paranoid that someone is going to recognize me or that I am being watched by homeland security. I am paranoid that future jobs I apply for will do intensive background checks and that the videos may show up. I am absolutely exposed. The worst part is that normally with child pornography

Carol was always the strange girl. She had some kind of muscle tremor disorder and shook all the time people picked on her and made fun of her. I was an oddball too so we were friends though strained at times. Both of us struggled to not be the most hated and most teased girl in our class so our friendship was base on mutual understanding of how much school life sucked. The summer of 7th grade we hung out a lot and became decent friends. We trusted each other and talked on the phone all the time. She told me that her uncle had been molesting her since she was 4 or 5 (dont remember exactly but young) and that her mom knew but either couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it. That was a shock to me but I was 13 and had no clue wtf I could do about it if her mom and grandma knew and couldn't help her. Anyhow



She had the same problems at her new school. Everybody picked on her and thought she was weird. She ran away from home for a couple of weeks and the police found her and brought her back. She ran away 2 more times that I knew of and for whatever reason.. likely me getting caught up in my own school drama, what I knew about some guy she was dating. I knew nothing of any of this and ended up hanging up on her because she was freaking out so bad. It was weird but I didn't really understand what was going on.


About a month later Carol called me from a pay phone


I switched schools and made a bunch of friends and totally forgot about Carol. Then maybe 6 months later or so her mom called me crying asking if I knew where Carol was and if I could help her find her. I told her she had called me a long time ago but that I didn't know where she was.


To my knowledge today


Sometimes I still google her name. Search for her in the directory of missing and exploited children. I've never found anything on her. No missing persons report, but I think that might be a bit creepy. In the mean time, I go about my life knowing that my friend is probably dead and I did nothing to stop that.

At first we lived in a small apartment and I slept on a cot in the living room.

By the time I was 14 he and some girls had sex openly in front of me, then demanded to know when I was gonna talk her into screwing him. I had already asked and she said no, so I told him that and he got pissed. He kicked me out a few months later.

We've made up since then and I see him quite a bit. He's still a lecherous poonhound but he's no longer smooth and sexy (back when I was growing up, lost all his muscles and is generally a loser.

Today my friend and I traveled to the prison my pen pal is in (just over 2 hours away). We met up with my pen pals father who flew down to visit his son from New Jersey. He was very nice and kept telling me how great I was for taking the time to write to his ""idiot son"" and every time they talk on the phone he can tell when he got a letter from me that day because he sounded so much happier.  

The atmosphere of the visiting area was very light and easy going. It's a minimum security facility, laughing with their dad's, and having a good time. 

My pen pal, I think he was nervous. He has the most wonderful brown soulful eyes I can stare into all day. We stayed from 9am to 3pm (the start and end of visiting hours) but it felt like an hour. We talked about everything and nothing. We laughed a lot. Even got our picture taken. They are very strict about public displays of affection, but you get two hugs (a hello and goodbye), and K and I took full advantage, and hugged for a while.

1347101547.0,zjv0g,Drinking and thinking about my time as a cop. Confession time with a throwaway.,former1,146,29,35,"Back in the early 1990s a few politicians in the [south Florida] area made names for themselves by demonizing all forms of adult entertainment. Everything from adult movie theaters to strip-clubs became a huge target; protests outside of these many establishments became commonplace and the media ate it up. Eventually a special task force was set up to confront the “problem”. Of course

I was one of the officers put on the task force. Why? Not because of seniority or anything like that. Hell I was so green I still bought the coffee. No, jokingly asked him at a family gathering if I could be reassigned to surveil some of the local strip-clubs. It was honestly a joke. But the following Monday during the daily run-down I was told that I had been reassigned.

For the next six months I was no longer in uniform. Instead I spent most of my duty-hours dressed as a regular Joe sitting inside of strip-clubs and tipping dancers with taxpayer money. My mission? To try and get the “dancers” to either sell me drugs or better yet agree to have sex with me. Busting them for prostitution was preferred because the laws in Florida were strict: if it could be demonstrated that an establishment was an accessory in the propagation of illicit activities then they could be sued by the D.A. as a co-conspirator

Busting dancers for drugs was easy but after my first few I was rotated back into regular patrol. When I asked my godfather about this he explained that the D.A. wasn't interested in drugs. He wanted prostitution busts. Those types of take-downs would help him shut down some of the many *many* strip-clubs. I'll be honest

And I sure did. Time was I wasn't a fatass old man so getting the dancers to like me was easy. I'd get them in the champagne room, “For another $200 I can give you a real, real good time...”

I would play dumb. Had to. Then they'd usually get blunt: “$200 and I'll suck your cock.” That's when I would bust them and make my collar.

I never felt bad about any of that. Hell

Only one of those clubs ever got shut down though. Despite all the pressure from on high there was just never enough proof that the prostitution met the legal definition of accessory. Too many of the girls just didn't fall for our traps (seriously: I'd guess that only 1 in 8 of the girls ever even hinted at prostitution and half of those were too smart to ever make an offer) and the club owners could always point out that they had strict rules about such behavior anyway. To my knowledge not one of my collars ever admitted that the owners knew what was going on either. 

So yeah

Shortly after that “success” the task force was quietly disbanded and I returned to patrol.

Oh-- I came here to confess something didn't I? Okay. During my brief time on the task force I let more than a few girls off with a warning. I still vividly remember the look in their eyes when I went into my wallet and pulled out my badge instead of money. I honestly got off on that look of total fear. In my defense I was definitely not the only one who did that but still

My sister is just hot - all my friends have said so.  Add to my horniness the fact that she walks around the house in her underwear and constantly complained about how sexually frustrated she was because she hadn't had sex in a long time.

One night, and at first tried to think of something other than her.  Of course, that meant that I could think of nothing else *but* her, and I wound up jerking off while thinking about my sister for the first time in my life.  (I feel like this is something of an accomplishment, because I have several attractive sisters and I was 28 by then) I felt (at least a little) wretched and hated myself.  I couldn't fall back asleep, and I couldn't think of anything but how sexy she is.

As even the worst ideas have a tendency to do when you're alone in the dark with nothing to convince you otherwise, but after a couple hours alone in the dark, this started to seem like maybe it wouldn't *really* be cheating.  Maybe it would just be my sister and I, who have always been pretty close, just getting a bit closer - while solving both of our problems.  She also wouldn't have to sleep some random fuckhead, and would be guaranteed to get fucked and eaten really well.  (Not to brag, but I know I'm good at it.)  She is also the kind of person who seems to have absolutely no boundaries.  She will tell me ANYTHING.  I know what song was playing when she lost her virginity.  (Toadies - Possum Kingdom)  (Just so you know - The Toadies rock)  I never managed to fall back asleep.

In the morning, ""No, not at all, but not because the couch isn't comfortable.""  She asked why, so I told her I'd had a sex dream.  She immediately asked for details, because that's just how she is.  I took a deep breath and said, ""Well... it was about you.""  She didn't really seem weirded out or anything.  She just said, and was in fact ""flattered"" just kinda finalized my intention.  I was going to try and find a way to fuck her.

A few evenings later, freaking her the hell out, and having her run off and tell the whole family and my girlfriend.  I finally settled on, ""Ya know the dream I had about you?  I'm still having trouble dealing with it.... because I'm pretty sure I actually would if you wanted to.""  I felt like if I went into more detail about how it would be the perfect solution to our problems, she'd feel pressured and it would get weird.

When I told her, I kinda figured that when you told me.  Just don't ever try anything, and we're okay and I won't tell anybody.""  She went on to try to ease my mind by telling me she didn't think any less of me and it's not at all uncommon so I shouldn't feel bad about it.

I moved in with him when I was 18 because my home life wasn't that great and I thought I was in love. Shortly after moving in he had an accident at his work. At first money wasn't a problem: he had this supplemental insurance thing that basically made it so that he was still earning as much as he had been while working. After a few months that went away but he still couldn't work so all he had was worker's comp. At that point I took a part time job at an animal shelter to help pay the bills and eventually had to cut back my college courses a lot because the commute/work-load was killing me. Then his workman's comp went away too and he filed for disability benefits.

It was around that time that I started to notice the drinking. I had ignored it for a long time but couldn't anymore. Whenever he got his check he would go out to the bar and come home stinking drunk. Even when he didn't have a check he found money to at least buy cheap whisky and stay loaded all day while he sat around the house.

Two years ago I got a call from a number I didn't recognize. My awesome boyfriend had apparently gotten so drunk *at a fucking stripclub* that they were refusing to let him leave unless he called a cab. But guess what? Genius didn't have money for a cab. So I had to go and pick him up. Obviously I was furious but he was so trashed I couldn't even yell at him at the time. 

The next day we had a huge fight: I didn't like that he'd been hiding the fact that he was going to stripclubs. I didn't like that he was wasting all our money there. I didn't like how he was drinking away my paychecks and his disability payments. I didn't make enough money at the shelter to support his fucking drunken bar-life! His response was

I also give a lot of these men my dummy-cell number and have built up a sizable client list. When they call and I'm not at work or school I arrange to meet them.

Meanwhile I live this double-life at home. I laugh about my job to Avery and brag about how easy it is (it's the hardest job I've ever had) because men just throw money at me to see my tits. He has no idea that I've been unfaithful to him. He often says to his friends that he's my first and I'm his last. They think that's hilarious. I just bite my tongue because the truth would ruin everything.

Do I feel bad? No. Not for cheating on him. If I hadn't started this we would have been evicted a long time ago. What I do pays the bills and more.

Do I feel bad? Yes. For living a lie. None of my family or friends know that I even strip let alone sell myself for sex. And every single day I have to pretend to Avery that all I do is wiggle my ass in a guy's lap to make a few bucks. I hate lying but my work has turned me into a habitual liar.

Do I feel bad? Yes. For not being able to do the smart thing and just leave the asshole and re-focus on school and my future.

After putting up with these sudden rages and aggressiveness for a couple of months, rattling off the ""I didn't know what I was doing...won't happen ever again...blah blah blah"" speech. Being a naive teenager who thought she was in love, I forgave him.

Fast forward a couple of weeks later. We are at a party, yelling at people and taking a couple swings at one guy. I apologized, took 'D' upstairs inside, and tried to get him to lay down on a couch. He wouldn't listen, and kept trying to walk out the door. I pushed him back on to couch, rinse, repeat. After a few minutes of this, and he slammed his head against the arm. He immediately jumped up and came after me, and started trying to take swings at me, punching

I guess it would be worth mentioning here that when I am scared

The fighting back and forth continued, and I lost my balance. Where did I fall? Why, the *corner*, made into a 3 sided pen by the end of the couch. When 'D' realized I couldn't move now, he got *mean*. He started to kick me in the ribs, legs, back and arms. After a while of this, he got on his knees and started to choke me. I was beginning to get tunnel vision when we both heard someone coming towards the room. 'D' jumps off of me, which explained why I was on the floor &amp; any noise heard. The person at the door left, and left the room. I passed out. 

The next day, he managed to gag me, drag me to his room by my hair, and get all of my clothes off. He forced himself on me, laughing at me crying the whole time. He slapped me repeatedly during this, and afterwards kicked me in the side. He went into another room for a bit while I stayed on his floor and cried. He left about an hour later. I gathered my things, left, which I do not understand

The end result of this time in my life was/is: 

* about 23 deep bruises all over my body

* I think a rib may have been fractured

* slight bruising around my neck from choking

* chunks of hair missing from being dragged down hall

* severe anxiety issues

* severe trust issues

Surprisingly, but I do not let it control my life. It did not make me hate men or become sex-shy, either. I have had a couple of relationships since then, and am now in a relationship with the man that I hope to marry (we have a wonderful sex life). All in all, I feel that I came out of that experience with more of my sanity than most women do, and for that I am grateful.

She and I were both in the Army at the time

She had a very casual view of sex and to be honest I had as well. She saw the fact that her brother was incredibly bad with women (and actually socially with anyone) as a problem that she could use me to fix.

In many ways I had an equally casual view of sex

As for him

Without dwelling too much on the sex it was pretty bad. Though on a non sexual level I found it quite excting in some ways

I thought it would take an hour or so but I ended up spending the night with him. Mainly because the first few times were so bad

Eventually with a lot of prompting from me he made a decent stab at fucking me. For obvious reasons he found doggy style easier than making eye contact.

Anyway I was at his wedding years later

I kind of have mixed views about the whole thing. Sexually it did nothing for me

I met this man, leading to him threatening to drive up that night. I didn't think he would. Friday night, around 11PM, he texted me his room number at a local hotel. 

I decided to go. I figured I might have a good time. I've never done the 'one night stand' thing

Now I had been joking with my friends since my boyfriend dumped me that the next guy was going to be in trouble. That I would punish him for everything. When I arrived at the hotel I had an idea: I have always been submissive with sex - and tonight I wanted control. I wanted to abuse this man. I texted him ""I'm very rough

We had the awkward introductions. He kissed me. I broke the kiss and slapped him hard across the face. ""Did I give you permission to fucking kiss me?"" He hung his head and apologized

I'll gloss over *everything* I did to this poor man, without asking. I have never been domineering in sex, ever. It felt so good! 

We were on round three

I spent all day Saturday not knowing how he was or what happened. He finally texted me late last night. It was a heart attack. He had taken a viagra

I don't want to go into too many details because enough people in my life know bits and pieces about my situation and I would like to remain anonymous.  Also, I am a mid-20's white male.

Growing up I was not very sexual. I don't think it was because I wasn't interested but I was just so busy with everything going on in my life that the free time usually required for a kid to get away and get his rocks off was not there for me.  I had to have a job from the age of 13, a useful tool for avoiding the trappings of growing up in an urban neighborhood many people are scared to visit.  I didn't have many friends outside of my athletics and of the few friends I had that were girls I knew them so long that I couldn't imagine putting their friendship at risk by entering into a BF/GF relationship with them.  Ok, maybe I did imagine and did think about it a lot, but I never acted on it.

I had saved up enough money on the side after working and helping the family to travel, the Middle East, and Europe.  I left home in August.  In October I was walking through a club district late at night and was attacked from behind by a man with a knife.  He pulled me into a nearby ally behind a dumpster before I could react. I sort of panicked and before I could get out my wallet my pants were down.  The rest is a blur and makes me nauseas to think about but I ended up on the ground, pants down to my knees, and some blood coming out of my extremely sore anus.  Strangely he left my phone and wallet in my pocket and never said a word to me.  Not sure what to do I called the embassy who told me to go to a hospital and there I was met by police and a representative from the embassy who was there to make sure I didn't say the wrong thing because sodomy is illegal where I was.  

I didn't leave my room for two weeks except to eat.  After the first day I didn't even shower.  I was a fucking mess in a random country with no real friends or family to help out.  My mother wanted me to come home but I wouldn't budge.  I was renting a room from some local students who did not know what was going on, a girl my age who was volunteering as an English teacher at a school for abandoned teens.  For some reason these kids weren't in an orphanage, they kept their own residence and some even had younger siblings to look after, so we had some interesting conversation.  Sorry for the tangent.  Anyways, being my first time eating a real meal in a long time, I started feeling very good about myself, and ended up talking confidently with this girl all night.  She ended up staying in my room that night but nothing happened other than us falling asleep spooning.

The next morning reality hit me. She was a nice girl and all but I didn't want to drag anyone into my shit storm life.  At this point I had cancelled the rest of my trip and decided to stay in the country until I was no longer needed by the police and then bolt.  In a rare state of openness I told her everything that had happened that morning.  She was obviously horrified and when I told her that I didn't want her to be dragged down by me she wouldn't have any of it.  Looking back it was obviously very selfish of me to even mention it to her and give her that burden to hold on her shoulders.  We started seeing each other daily and she even accompanied me to all of my followup doctor visits (std checks, and we had sex. A lot.  A normal day had us having sex at least 3 times a day.  We used a condom for the first month but once I got negative results from all of the STD tests we stopped using protection as she was on the pill.

After her stint as a teacher was up it was time for us both to fly back to our respective homes, again on her (or her family's) dime.  She wasn't going to school but her mom just wanted her to be happy I guess.  We lived basically as a married couple through my time in college and got married as soon as I graduated.  That was two years ago and now my wife is pregnant with our first child.

After all that

A big part of me wants to just disappear.  Not die but to just go away.  I often think about leaving everyone in my life behind so that I don't have anyone to drag down.

She cannot go along with many people, and refuses to change herself for it, while being fine just being like this.

She wanted me to be a handicap, and my mind is still fucked. I am extremely paranoid, cannot trust people, always think people are talking behind my back, and many more.

** --- THE STORY --- **

(If you just want to read the confession

For the past five years, was making good money and I was so happy - I was done with school, I had the car I wanted for a long time, I was seeing friends all the time, volunteered my time at an equine ranch helping to bring sick horses back to health so they could be used to rehabilitate disabled children. I had a plan, my life was stable and I was well on my way to being self-sufficient in my mid-twenties.

Two months after I got the job, I didn't have a job. I ended up getting a part-time job at a pet store cleaning ferret shit for $7 an hour. They cut my hours down from 24 a week to just three without an explanation. When I asked, the manager snapped at me and told me to leave her alone. I quit on the spot.

I've been looking for an IT job everywhere in the United States, every time I try to apply for a position at that university, my resume gets thrown into a black hole, never to be seen again. By the time I figured out what was going on, it was too late for me to do anything about it legally.

Finally, I enjoyed the work. Three months after I started, I was ""let go"" for three months. I was told that business had slumped and they didn't have the money to pay me. Found out they hired somebody while I was gone. A full time coworker left and I tried to get his position so I could become full time. I was told this all the time: ""You can't do it because you can't hear people come in or answer the phones."" I got the government involved and they provided equipment to enable me to do my job. My boss never let me used them. He kept pulling people in from the outside to fill in the position, one after another while I was stuck at the bottom of the totem pole. Eventually he stopped scheduling me. When I called him to ask about it, he said he just wouldn't schedule me anymore because I ""can't answer the phones or talk with customers."" - which is what I have done, and I had no problems, thankyouverymuch! Oh, therefore they are exempt from discrimination laws? Yeah... I've had a paralegal

** --- THE CONFESSION --- **

So now, but in New York City, Boston, etc. I might have enough money to last me until August, but afterwards, there are going to be major changes.

You see, get in my car and just drive. I'm going to live entirely out of my car with only my phone, laptop, clothes and passport. I'm going to drive around the US and Canada. I'm going to look for jobs while living out of my car. I'm going to see some friends, make new ones and have a huge fuckin' adventure. I'm going to visit as many states and provinces as possible. I'm not even going to tell my family until I'm on the road. I just want to be by myself, not having to rely on anyone for anything. And you know what? It will be fucking glorious.

It all started last summer, my brother, and two of our friends who were dating at the time. The waiter bought us both complimentary sundaes to share, with these love heart designs in them in strawberry sauce. My brother  was like, err we're not dating, were brother and sister, even though to me, but then he was like oh god and started laughing

The guy we went with is known for being pervy, he started kidding around  a LOT about us dating, and at first I was cool with it and played along bla bla, acting grossed out (really I was just humouring him and annoyed), he started telling strangers we were dating all the time for the reactions etc. Eventually his at the time gf told him that I thought it was getting really old and he stopped it, until this end of the summer party. 

It was only the second time I'd been drunk properly, I just have fast vague memories of going from person to person rambling about bs and pretending I wanted to be there (I DO like parties, just.. this was too big), but this part of the night is clear in my mind, when that edgy guy gathered everyone around to play dares. Long story short, the bottle landed on me and my brother, if the edgy guy had spun the bottle I'd had refused flat out, and I was like no, and started a chant to get us to kiss, got a bit upset and left the room

I started having dreams about him around this time, read up on incest, discovered reddit this way... and /r/incest, and in a matter of weeks developed this completely perverse fetish out of nowhere. I started thinking about things me and him had done when we were really little, we had this game called ""the naked game"", it was a completely fucking dumb roleplaying game, where one of us would roleplay a member of the public, but we'd take it in turns, and, lay on each other... it was sexual. I started to get off on the memories of those games we hadn't played since we lived at my old house

I realise the attraction has become really bad since the summer, etc, last october i had no courage during that half term, over winter i was alone with him every now and then, i tried flirting, joking, i cuddled with him in his bed whilst we watched tv, far more than could be considered normal or appropriate, ""if i wasnt your sister would you be attracted to me?"", and made them with increasing frequency

today hes been odd with me, and that hes realised the truth, that im attracted to him, and ive become obsessed with the idea of being with him...im terrified if hes realised the truth, not because i think he'll tell someone about it, but because he'll start treating me differently, and most importantly

That later changed and I have hated him for years. Now we're dating again and all my friends know about it is that I'm dating a much older man. Let me try to explain.

When I was eleven years old my best friend's parents were divorced. She spent every other weekend at her dad's house and sometimes I spent the weekend there with her. His place was outside of the city, a five minute walk from a lake, really nice place. So much different than the city.

Mr. Dean was really cool too. He would bring us out for ice cream, he'd be there for me.

So we became YIM buddies. I kept this secret from everyone, was she happy in school, things like that). As for my parents he pointed out that they wouldn't understand how a girl my age and a man his age could be friends. That much was definitely true, my parents were very over-protective. So he was my secret friend and I thought it was really cool to have a grown man as a friend, especially one who was always complimenting me so much and telling me how special I was. It wasn't long before I developed a crush on him.

It took me awhile to realize he was flirting with me. Thinking back about it I now realize he had been flirting from the start but at eleven years of age I had little self confidence, probably hinting she wanted one for herself (she was always trying to get him to buy her things). When he asked me about it online I said that yes, my parents had a new digital camera and it was awesome. That's when he asked me to take some ""special pictures"" of myself for him.

He didn't ask for nudes at first, and sent them to his e-mail account.

After that things began to escalate really fast. He sent me a picture of his penis with the title ""Look what your pictures did to me!"". He then asked me for nudes and by now I was feeling older and sophisticated so I complied. He started asking me if I ever touched myself (I did) and then if I ever thought of him while I touched myself (I did). That led us to full on Internet sex. He then started providing me with passwords to (legal) porn websites

Basically within two months of beginning our online friendship he was turning me into his personal little pervert girl. And I was happy to be that for him

That's what led to our first real sexual encounter. I was almost twelve now and he said that it was time for us to spend some real time together. He came up with the whole plan and then one day after school I met him at a nearby gas station and he brought me back to his farm for the night. My parents thought I was at a sleepover at another friend's house. He had a cell phone that he'd given me the number for to give for them. When they called later that evening

He started things off with me slow

After that night we started seeing each other a lot more often. I lost my virginity to him shortly after my 12th birthday. We ended up ""dating"" like that for about two years. During that time he really messed with my head as much as he did with my body. He explained that promiscuity was a natural thing and that I shouldn't turn into people like my parents who saw sex as this dirty, online, sharing pictures of each other and talking about the most perverted things imaginable. He once convinced me to try and seduce my older brother which led to his disgust and horror and a threat to tell our parents. When I tried again due to Mr. Dean's insistence he followed through on his threat and my parents put me into therapy. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Mr. Dean.

Up until two months ago I've hated him for what he did to me. He definitely abused me

And despite all that I am now dating him. For the last two months since randomly running into me at work we have been dating openly. He hasn't changed much either and I hate myself for being too weak to do the right thing and cut him off. But there's this part of me I can't explain that enjoys reliving the past. After a wild spree after the last time I saw Mr. Dean back when I was fourteen I had only been with two men in five years, all with different male friends of his, and one semi-gangbang.

Out of all my roommates, who don't enjoy drama or head-games, but just want to live life. N is just one of those guys who is just different, and I liked that about him. We're also both artists, which was a real bonding thing, I think. He understood my art, and that meant a lot to me.

There was always this underlying sexual tension I think we both tried to ignore. I knew I shouldn't pursue it. Roommate fucking leads to roommate drama. But I got drunk one night and texted him inviting him up into my room.

He didn't respond until the next day, in person.

We're both shy, and then I texted him again, asking him to come up and spend the night with me. But this time, he actually did. 

I led him to my bed, and it felt fucking awesome. He's 5 years older than me, and it really shows. He's the most sexually confident partner I've ever had, and certainly the biggest. He even put a condom on, but got whiskey dick and we called it a night.

The next day we started making out again, but we ended up laying in bed for an hour, talking about our sexual pasts and various experiences. He told me about his sexual history, even explaining his gay experiment. I told him about the sexual abuse in my past. I rarely talk about it, but I'm glad I did.

1336802804.0,tjcxm,I was violently raped by my boss and then had a (mostly) consensual affair with him for six months.,self-loathing-cpa,150,43,59,"Brand new throw-away account for this one. I've wanted to share this story before but all relevant threads usually have thousands of comments before I get to them so I never have.

This is really hard to type because I have literally never told anyone about it before. Okay here goes.

Oh, and this all took place about five years ago.

I work as a CPA for a small technology company. I got the job right out of college because one of my best friends from college had married the company's owner and convinced me to give their startup a shot. When I started there were only five of us but we've got over thirty employees now so it's been pretty successful. It's a great job

About a year after starting the job we landed three big accounts that really saved us. In order to celebrate the owner

Maggie (my friend

Dave was pretty drunk and doing what drunk men do. He was flirting heavily with me. I wasn't worried at all because I knew how much the company's success meant to him and even figured he deserved to celebrate. But when I told him I was leaving he ""jokingly"" told me he wasn't letting me leave because I was too drunk to drive (I definitely wasn't). 

He sat down next to me on the sofa and playfully gripped my wrist and said he'd force me to stay because it was for my own good. This is when I started to realize I might be in trouble. He wasn't acting like himself at all and he went from polite flirtation to making crude comments about my breasts (for example

His hand went to my thigh as he started talking about how Maggie is awful at giving head. He said that he bet I was great at giving blowjobs because of my lips and repeatedly asked me about how often I ""suck cock"". He wanted to know if I gave any of my co-workers (one in particular) blowjobs. Still trying to play this off as a joke I just laughed and said I really had to leave. 

Things took a bad turn when my cellphone rang, I'm your boss. This is more important.""

At this point I really knew I was in trouble. I struggled against him and for the first time started to bluntly protest his behavior. Before I'd been just casually pushing away his hand from my thigh

And that's the worst thing about what happened next. If I had been blunt from the beginning

I'm not going into detail about the rape itself but I do want to make clear that this was not a ""date rape"" type of situation. I was so terrified that I did stand up for myself. I fought him

He was really rough with me so even though I tried I couldn't stay completely quiet. I kept hoping Maggie might wake up and come downstairs but she never did. As he raped me I remember just thinking

When he did finally finish all he did was get off me, ""I'm going to bed. Goodnight."" Just like that, all casual. Meanwhile I was a mess, my panties were missing (I never did find them), and my dress and bra were ruined. I only vaguely remember holding my dress together as I went out to my car and drove home. I don't think I cried again until I got safely into bed.

Here's the strangest part, I just went along with pretending nothing had happened.

Even worse than that is that the next time he hit on me, I suppose, or maybe part of me just liked it. I don't know. But that began the ""mostly consensual"" part of the affair. Two or three times a week for the next six months we would hook up in one way or another. Sometimes at the office, sometimes at hotels, sometimes at my apartment.

So what do I mean by ""mostly"" consensual? Well there was always this aura of fear about it. I never once initiated anything, he was often angry, and he had a very very huge sense of entitlement. 

All that time I was still having lunch with Maggie most days and that hurt me as well. I was having an affair with her husband. How awful is that? She was my friend! One time I had a pregnancy scare and I've never felt so awful because Maggie had been trying to get pregnant for quite a while but it was taking longer than they'd expected (since then they've had two kids). During that scare I remember at one lunch she was talking about fertility clinics and that just really got to me.

The affair ended for reasons I don't really understand. One day after giving a blowjob he just said

I'm still at the company though. Pretty much everyday I still see Dave and I see Maggie often as well (she no longer works there full time). Sometimes I wonder what kind of awful person I must be that I would react to what happened the way I did. The whole thing

1347312387.0,zo92d,I lied about who the father of my child was.,throwawaybabystory,141,38,65,"Reflecting on this is so strange because I can't make sense of my decisions. This was the worst

I was involved in a friends-with-benefits situation with a guy, who we'll call George. I was never sleeping with them at the same time, but I ended things with Kyle only about a week before I began having sex with George again.

Kyle and I were irresponsible. He pulled out. Once, we decided to have sex again. The next day I took the emergency contraceptives.

A few weeks later

The only rationale I can offer for my decision was that Kyle was the ""free spirit"" type. He drank a lot, and before the baby would even be born, he'd be across the country.

George was a man who wanted to settle down and have kids. He wanted to be a father, I told George I was pregnant. He'd never even known about Kyle's existence.

I can't figure out what I was expecting. I was aware of all the ways I could be found out. What if I have the kid

And what if the kid looks exactly like Kyle? He was about 6'4"" with nearly white-blonde hair and a goofy, studious, serious. I hoped the kid would look like me.

I pushed these thoughts out of my mind as often as I could. I guess I just convinced myself everything would be ok. I felt uncomfortable when George would talk about himself and the child. Sometimes I wanted to scream, but I didn't understand what to do, and I loved it; the baby I was going to have.

I know I fucked up, and yet, I felt lightened. It was the strangest mix of emotions. I hated myself for what I had done, and I was so thankful that I'd got out of it -- of course that escape was heartbreaking. I remember sobbing and clutching a baby blankie my grandmother had gotten for the baby. The only thing that had ever touched the tiny blip of anything my baby ever was, was the inside of me. There was nothing to hold on to. The story of her that people knew wasn't even accurate: her physical existence, who she was made up of, was known only to me.

After the miscarriage, and the child, for holding him back. He told me that I was right, that he would've felt that way. He was kind to me. He asked me what I wanted to name it. He hugged me, and he forgave me.

But I never told George, and that it would be his. I didn't have a child, and it wasn't his. He doesn't need to know that second fact. It would break his heart. It's irrelevant to our lives now. I feel guilt over it, yes, but I'm not going to relieve my guilt at the expense of him.

I know this was a horrible thing to do. I am filled with disgust at myself. I truly don't understand it. I don't understand how I could make such terrible decisions. I just try to forget it most of the time

I absolutely HATE it when I see a white guy dating an Asian girl. Not particularly because I have anything against any race or interracial dating. But just because it makes dating for Asian guys so much harder! 

If you think about it is true that a lot of Asian girls (esp those who were born/raised here) prefer white guys. It's like a ""catch"" or something to them. Like I've gone on online dating sites

A lot of white guys actually prefer Asian girls too. Think about like how popular Asian porn is and stuff. Like I guess it's that exotic/unique look that attracts them. However

So, and leave us Asian guys with nothing. 


EDIT* 

This is just my theory as to why this is the case. I think that a lot of Asian girls prefer white guys because they grew up around the western culture. When you look at the magazines, etc. the beautiful people are the blonde haired, blue eyed white muscly men or the fit, lean blonde haired women. I think that is why so many Asian girls try to look more ""white"" (dye hair, colored contacts, etc) and prefer to date white guys.

When I went to college

It started with burglarizing(robbery is when another person is involved

This quickly escalated to businesses.  Probably the most risky was a place where the guards carry M4's and you have to have a security badge to get on the property.  They even responded to a silent alarm that I wasn't able to disable, then radioed to their dispatch that it was a false alarm.

I've outrun cops on foot three or four times.  I've outrun them in cars a few times.  I've had to spend hours hiding in woods waiting for them to leave before I could get out of dodge.  I know how to completely disable an alarm system in a matter of seconds, run police scanners, etc.  

All of this was happening during the same time that ebay was spinning up.  I was able to unload every single item I didn't keep on ebay.  If your stuff is stolen

It has been over 10 years since my last time.  I've legally made over 6 figures for 4 or 5 years now, etc.  However, there's not a house or business I've visited that I haven't taken note of the security, entry and exit points, location of high value items, etc.

I regret every single thing I stole and I don't say that lightly as I regret almost nothing in my life.  I wish I could find the people I harmed and write them checks out of my savings to replace the stuff I stole.

A few words to those that want to stop people like me.  Don't buy an alarm that uses a telephone line.  Some systems use cellular service, in the attic, etc.  Most installer put them as close to the front door as possible (usually a coat closet).  All it takes is me cutting the phone line, entering the house and ripping the siren off the wall and your alarm system is useless.

Don't leave junk sitting out when trying to sell your home.  Pretending to be a buyer, and also schedule the owners to be out of the home for a set period of time with the alarm off.

The actual sexual abuse started with something called ""the doggy game.""  This is surprisingly hard to write.  He went through various stages with this game.  It started us both clothed but me crawling around on my hands and knees with my butt up in the air barking and panting like a dog and then he would come behind and basically try to mount me and it was my job to try to get away.  There were about 4 other stages that he took before we were both naked together but I don't really want to create a how to book with this post so I will leave that out.  But needless to say the whole time he used the pretext of the ""game"" to do all sorts of things to me.  During this whole time he had me totally convinced that everything was normal and that this is ""what adult friends do.""  

If I would ever refuse to do something that he wanted of me like wear my mother's lingerie (which I am glad to say I never did) he would totally cut me out of his life for awhile which was a big deal because I had no friends and I had no support at home (my step dad used to kidnap me to get back at my mom, or would act like he would kill both me and my mom constantly).  Because of that and the fact that he was the only one I could talk to and the only one who seemed interested in helping me I was totally under his control.  

It eventually stopped because one day he wanted me to get on top of him like he would do to me and I had an erection from what he has been doing to me and when I penetrated him he freaked the fuck out and yelled at me a lot and scared me screaming that I must be some kind of fucking faggot and so on and so on.  I told him that I didn't want to play the ""doggy game"" ever again and then he really got mad and threatened to kill me and my family if I ever told and all sorts of stuff on top of how what a worthless pile of shit and how I was just a dumb fucking fag etc.  

I didn't see him for a long time after that

The weirdest thing about all of this

Meanwhile after he moved at the very end of 6th grade I started going online to cybersex adults of both genders (since I am straight I preferred women but they were harder to find).  I can remember hating it with all of my being.  I can remember physically shaking and feeling cold and frozen every time I would go up to my room and wait for the computer to come on. I would have cyber sex with probably 12+ people a night and would be unable to stop until I found one that was fucked up enough.  As soon as I would cum I would instantly hate myself and wish I would die and that I could stop.  But the very next night I would be right back there, I know).  

Around that time I realized that it was killing me because it was part of this fucked up cycle I had/have.  I feel tons of stress because of school or life or insert reason

The worst thing about it is that when I am not in that state I feel nothing about any of the abuse

At first after stopping the chat they were gay fantasies so I thought, so I know now its best to stay away from that.  Now the fantasies are between me and a woman but they involve me getting kidnapped and basically forced into sexual slavery and put in positions where I have no hope.  

These get me ungodly hard and work really well but there are two big down sides.  #1 If there is any weakness in the plan of the person kidnapping me or whatever it turns to how can I kill them (to escape and get away/get revenge) and can't cum (which is a really good thing, that is obvious especially by the things I tell myself sometimes when I masturbate during high stress situations, but I don't know what to do.  More importantly I had to tell someone, no one knows the whole story.  A couple people know I had some abuse as a kid but none of the details.  

TL:DR I have issues.

A little about me:  I'm a 28/m.  Married.  Have a job I hate.  I live in an amazingly beautiful city near the beach.  

From the time I graduated highschool up until now, piece of crap apartment.

My marriage is really the only thing I can be proud of.  My wife is gorgeous.  She's smart, has a great relationship with her family, and loves me to death.

I, arrogant, have no contact with my family, and I take her for granted.  It sounds crazy as I type it out, and I can't believe I've let it go on so long.

I have no real friends.  In highschool, both guys and girls, who I felt somewhat close to.  I had a few really close guy friends that I would hang out with almost everyday.

But now I don't have any close friends.  I'm a friendly guy, but that's it.  I have no desire to hang out with them, and even 5 minutes into a conversation I want to walk away.  

I'm antisocial.  I'd rather hang out by myself than be with friends.  I'm content with sitting in my room playing video games on a Friday night.  I've just recently come to realize that I've lost a few friends because of this

I try to rationalize this by saying to myself

I feel like I'm missing out on life.  I feel like the last 10 years have been a complete waste of time.  I've accomplished nothing.  I play video games every day for hours.  I get home from work and the first thing I want to do is turn on my PS3.  I get home from work around 3PM and play video games until about 5:30, video games, gym, dinner, tv, sleep.  The last 3 or 4 years have been like this.

Meanwhile, and I'm the only one in the theater.  I feel like I'm watching my friends live the life I wish I could.

I wake up every morning and tell myself

It's killing me.  

My wife has no idea.  I've had these feelings for so long that I feel like I can't tell anyone.  I realize this probably sounds stupid to most people

I plan on joining the CHP or Border Patrol in 2014 when my wife graduates from school.  I hope at that point my life turns around.

I graduated from high school in 2007 with the intentions of attending a school in Florida for a degree in Audio Engineering. My mom
The first month of college went perfect. The school is set up a little differently with scheduling but I basically made A's that first month. During the second month however, bullshitting, etc. The guy's house we would go over got into selling cocaine. This is where it all started.

*The Action:*
I went to go try it with him and his girlfriend and noticed that it took away the little paranoia I had that night from smoking weed. So naturally after a dumb thought
Two days later my student loan arrived.... Yes..
Now

One month later I'm on the airplane back home 50lbs lighter with no recollection of anything that second month. I don't remember if I went to class, etc. I just have little still images in my head of random scenes.
Being that my father passed away a few months earlier I knew I couldn't tell my mom what actually happened. So what did I do?
""I think I'm having a psychotic breakdown."" A few days after

I ended up going to 3 different doctors and eventually got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the more the doctor gave me. He was an asshole about ""Problem? Higher doses.""

*The Result:*
During those three years I started to believe I had those mental illnesses because I was constantly being treated like it by my family, doctors, etc. were all just to cover up my withdrawals. And basically I now have crippling anxiety because of all the stress of this lie and having to agree with all of the concerns and diagnostics. And of course with all of this: depression &amp; insomnia.

Edit: Upon proof-reading this I couldn't help but notice that I wrote half a biography...I guess if you self-""punish"" yourself for years and have nobody to talk to about it

I hope it's in good English I had to google some words.

Also it reads like I am spending every possible moment tied up, some months I did it not once, just like I felt, the whole text is over a time of about 4 years.

It started years ago when I was lying in my bed and pulled my 
underpants down to my ankles and pretended somebody was forcing me to sleep that way. That started to get boring so I went on to not wearing underwear during the day sometimes as a ""punishment""

Then started a time where I was alone at home every Saturday until late afternoon as my brother was at university(he’s way older) and my dad  had to work (no mom in our household)

After my leatherwork was such a success I decided to make myself a gag and shackles that I used to tie myself up inside a nearly empty closet in my room.

I did ""small"" stuff like this until I turned older any my brother moved out and my dad took a new job that required him to be in another city from Monday to Wednesday
That was when things like that got a number bigger, put handcuffs on my hand and feet, put the dog collar on and write random insults on myself with edding, stuff like ""fat pig"", ""dairy cow"", ""hood rat/village bike...(that doesn't seem to translate all too well)"", fuck hole"" and so on (and the stuff didn't even make sense
I would even sleep like that because nobody was coming home anyway. Sometimes I even slept next to the bed on the floor with the leash tied to a bed post.

Then I got the idea that on Wednesday I could cook a big meal for the next day because when our dad came home from work every Thursday my brother came by for a visit and we ate together
Then at some point things got pretty much insane, I would hang a rope down from two roof beams like a U-shape hanging close to the floor, and ""squatted"" down on it so that it would “cut” into my vagina, I took a candle holder that was so ""artsy"" you could squeeze in a candle at any direction, so I put one in at 90° to the floor and lie under it while it burned down so that the wax dribbled down on me, I would take a triangular log of wood and kneel on that so that the edge of the wood would “cut “ into my lower leg right below my knees (I’m not as fucked up to invent stuff like that, that’s called “Scheitelknien” in German)
But I wouldn't get enough, screw of this lattice-cover-thing, then I glued a wood rod to the fan blade and let it hit me when it spinned around.
Then someday I remembered the relatively normal days where I would just stand tied up in my closet and I felt like just standing still naked in the garden (that nobody can see into), I then just told him a story of how I was showering and thought I heard him knocking so I went down and when I looked outside the door snapped behind me, I had even let the water run to ""prove"" the story, but why would he doubt that anyway.
Anyway the point is, so I sew some kind of cushioned cloth-coating that where really thick, wrapped them around the chains so my arms wouldn't get hurt, put the time locked box with the key (In this case, for a bicycle lock) inside down beneath me, with the key hanging on a cord that was tied to my finger so I could pull it up after the box opened, stepped on a beer crate, kicked the box away

After that I was turning down my self-""punishing"" habits for a while, so I went outside where our trash can was (one of these wheelie bins), made a hole through the cap and this edge that it sits on so that I could put my padlock through, made a few little air holes near the top where nobody noticed, drove it in the garden just in case the garbage man came along or something, wrote ""trash belongs in the trash bin"" and ""trash doesn't wear clothes"" on myself, set inside the trash can, with the time lock box
I did stuff like this for some time, until ten or eleven or something, I hated to go to ballet where my mom would want me to go (there was no ""drill to become a prima ballerina"" behind it, she just though it was a good way to make friends which was dumb because I had friends, she just didn't like them), so I searched for this silly ballerina costume in the attic and squeezed myself into it, it was very thigh of course but it just so fit as I’m fucking small. My ballerinas didn’t fit any more so I bought new ones, but it felt not like enough so I just cuffed my arms together and made a split on the floor the next time I did it, and made a split on a thick (unlit) wax candle that I had glued to a mouse pad as bracket. I went even crazier the next time, I made a split between two wood posts that stand in the entrance room of our house and onto that electroshock-joystick

After a while of doing more ""normal"" stuff again I however felt like completely humiliating myself for whatever reason, time-locked myself to a garden chair in our garden for a long time, and just sat there until I couldn't hold it any longer and peed myself and then just sat there in my piss until the time lock opened feeling “wonderfully guilty” (I can’t describe it any different), than afterwards I ""had to"" wash the costume naked in the garden, and in return wear the completely wet costume for the rest of the day while I ""had to"" clean the house while cuffed up. This was pretty much during the day so whenever I had to pee again I ""had to"" use the garden-shower because I ""wasn't allowed"" to take the costume off, only to wash it. I did this ""cycle"" until it was dark and I decided it was time to sleep, and because I used it kind of a lot this day I ""had to"" sleep   on the garden shower
That was pretty recently and afterwards I only did ""smaller"" things again

In my original post, my little boy. I carried him for nine months and dreamed dreams of the man he could become. 

I have many bad memories of his childhood, so most mornings it would be the two of us up first and we would just watch cartoons together and drink coco and I would rub his hair. We have family trips and holidays and all of that. We have had good times.

A part of me looks at him and sees his potential. He is a tall

Unfortunately, his little brother who is half his size, through a window for using his bike. Luckily, Cam was only slightly hurt. But that was when I realized he couldn't be in this house and so did my husband, who has always been the most adamant that sending him anywhere would be more harm than good.

We found a military school and he's been there four months. It is going well. His grades are good and he even received some monthly awards. I almost found hope again. Until we visited last month. He informed me that he would be good until he was 18 and could do as he wanted (""I was stupid

Overall, and mostly asked for money for snacks and for us to send his bikes when he gained the privilege. He still despises his younger brother. I will never understand his hatred of Cam, just that occurred from the moment he saw him and has never desisted. 

I hope the best. Maybe three years of playing good will rub off and he will learn to live in society.Maybe he'll be toxic but not criminally

I did a paternity test before we sent him to military school, I was right- Ben is not my husband's son. I should've known to look at them- all behavior issues aside. Ben is so fair and lean, and very tall, where my husband is dark and broad and I'm a tiny red head. I obviously have not and will not tell either one. It could only cause more hurt.

Thinking that I was victim of some generational monster that was plaguing relationships these days. Always confused and hurt and frustrated by why these girls were constantly and relentlessly fucking me over. I was always a nice guy, right? Well here is my story. A real ""nice guy"".

August 2011, she was great to me. I couldn't have possibly or even still possibly ask anything more from a woman. I romanced her every chance I got. I was cheesy as hell and she ate it up. 

Well, independent, strong. She had an air of authority about her, a leader. And I loved it about her. 

I was stupid. I let my eye wander. I got her number after slight hesitation from her. She knew I was married and didn't want to smear her name by being seen talking to me (which was ironic finding out things that people knew about her later). Things didn't take long to escalate, that no one could ever know about it lest she be labelled a home wrecker. 

So I go home that night, how was work?"" I grunt in her general direction as I walk past her, staring at my phone, at the messages of this new... interest? An awakening deep inside me, the thought, or idea that I didn't need to settle. I was still young. I could do better, right? If this woman I was with loved me

Dinner was quiet, everything I hated. I had only entertained the idea of cheating on her, I hadn't even followed through with the act yet. But she knew that something had changed. And I can only image the fear in the pit of her stomach as she sat there slowly trying to swallow the bites of her food in her dry mouth.

I ignored her most of the next week. While I was in bliss. I felt alive, the excitement of something new and the risk of getting caught, from possibly both ends. Finally talk of following through with the deed got more and more frequent. And I suffered a slight and brief relapse into the plane of reality. I was going to hurt my wife. I think it was more for my own sake than hers that I felt this way. I didn't want to keep her from getting hurt/ I felt guilty and I wanted that feeling to go away. So I came forward with the proposition that we needed to have an open relationship. 

I explained to her while she cried on our bed that I felt I got married too early in life and that I felt like I didn't get to fully explore and experience my sexuality before I settled down and married her (We were each other's first love and lover). She reluctantly, she was just being ""immature"" and ""old fashioned"". 

Well, aside from sexting or the occasional makeout session. But, we talked every day. And not just about physical things, about how each other felt and what we wanted to do with our lives etc. It was now about three weeks to a month after I first started talking to her and I was more distant from my wife than I ever thought two people in a relationship could be without being apart. I still had sex with her, and she complied because it was the only time that I still showed emotion towards her. The only time I told her I loved her and told her the ""way she made me feel"". When we were done, I would walk out of the room and text the girl. 

This is about the time things ended with us. I get a text from the side-girl one day and she asks me what would happen if she wanted a relationship with me. I told her that my wife would be gone in a heartbeat. That I would kick her out. And I did. That night I told her that I didn't love her anymore. That I didn't feel the way I used to and we needed to end things. I told her that the open relationship was not going to work

I would like to take a moment and say I am not entirely without a heart. It got to me. More than I thought it would. I walked out into the living room after it had all transpired. My buddy was sitting on the couch confused as to what was going on. I told him I needed to get out of the house. So we drove around for about an hour while I cried and told him I didn't know what I was doing. He didn't know about any of this and I felt so isolated and scared that I couldn't tell anyone the truth

I made up so many cover stories for my friends

I pursued this girl

We were intimate once at this point. While her boyfriend was out of town. It was the moment we were waiting for

But I didn't mind, I genuinely loved this girl. So... I did what any logical person in my situation would do. I told her. I cannot describe what happened next. I suppose the only thing I could compare it to would be if a locomotive going at full speed were to suddenly hit a wall of titanium reinforced blocks of lead. She pulled a 180 so fast I still suffer from the lingering effects of whiplash at night. 

She wanted everything to stop. Right there. I was broken. Shattered. I overreacted, you're my world! I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. What a bitch! She screwed me over! what kind of sick, twisted, cruel monster would do a thing like that?! I devoted my everything to her and she just chewed me up and spit me out. 

Well, unfortunately for my ex, whom I had given the inclination that I had come to my senses and wanted her back, was again pushed to the side for my pursuit of happiness. 

So things continued on like this for some time. A little of a year to be exact. Things would yo-yo back and forth, all the while dating other guys. All the while I was on the sideline proclaiming my love for her. Getting angry, frustrated when she dated other guys, guys whom she just met, guys whom I was better than, smarter than, more polite than. And above all, more than anyone could ever understand. How could this cruel heartless bitch whom I loved more than life itself possibly think of ever entertain the idea of another man when there was one right here. One that would treat her right and never let her down. A real ""nice guy"" her knight in shining armor. The one who was going to bring chivalry back. 

(Don't get me wrong

I spent every moment I could expressing this rage to others. ""Nice guys finish last! I don't understand why girls don't just want a nice guy who will treat them right! Girls just want to go out and fuck and whore for attention!"" I got to the point where people didn't want to talk to me anymore. All I could do was complain about this girl (The cat was out of the bag by the way

All this time I kept my ex on the back burner, something to fall back on (Just as I was to this girl, but that was something I had not realized yet).

And threw all of this, I was just too much of a softie. A victim of my own emotions.

I can see now I have never been more wrong. I was a monster. A cruel and selfish being only capable of my own greedy desires. I was a hypocrite and and very large one at that. I took my loving wife for granted as well as my friends (whom are better to me than I deserve) as I ruthlessly slashed away at all who stood in the way of what I wanted. I was twisted and I didn't even realize it. I was helping another human cheat on her boyfriend. I was aiding in the violation of basic trust and intimacy. I would gain a smug satisfaction in her amazingly convincing stories of where she was at and what she was doing to her loving boyfriend (I don't know if he was a good guy or not, something I never understood.) sometimes she would be topless as I was giving her a massage, or we would be temporarily paused in whatever physical situation we were in, so she could answer the phone. And she never wanted me to stop what I was doing if it didn't hinder her from the call. Any time I complained about her, when things eventually went south again, I would mention this to people. How sick and twisted she could be. But... that was me enabling her. Yes, it was horrible

I had no consideration for this man she was with. And I relished in the fact that she was sneaking around with me. I felt confident, knowing her, probably thinking what she had done wrong. 

My complaints about this girl got more frequent and more heated

This continued on into other pursuits that I started. Some out of sheer loneliness, I would... I want to say ""let her"", but that is putting too much blame on this girls shoulders. I would ""more than willingly allow"" her to wedge herself back into my life and I would screw things up all over again. And when I was back on my own again, after she inevitably left me on my own once more, I would scream to the world once again... ""Nice guys finish last! I just want to find a girl who will appreciate me for me!"" When I was, in fact running over those very girls left and right. 

There were a few times, she said she loved me. Who knows if she really meant it or not. It is all irrelevant. I fell for it once again and I got my ass burned. This was about attempt #5 or #6 in a year time frame. Not only was I a selfish monster, I was a stupid one. Nothing could stop me in my now, pointless and utterly drained attempt at getting what I wanted. I did love her yes, but part of me was simply frustrated that I put so much time into something that I clearly hadn't, and like a little kid I was throwing a tantrum. 

To wrap all this up. I have since cut all contact with her(and it's been months, email, poem, college paper I ever wrote for her or even hint of her existence is out of my life. I have made no attempt to contact her or my ex and we are now divorced. She is, as far as I'm aware, happily dating a man and I have no intention of even possibly ruining that for her. 

I was not a ""nice guy"" and if I thought for a second I was, as a human being deserves to be. And even if I did, I don't know if I even deserve happiness. Looking back I find myself to be the true monster in this story. I knew what I was doing and I gladly let myself believe my lies. I let the love of my life down, I let my friends down, and I let myself down.

One night his weed dealer came over they smoked a bowl in the garage while I sat on the couch in the basement his dealer leaves then Pedro walks down into the basement. Pedro's parents are asleep upstairs and Pedro himself is completely wasted from a combination of drinking and smoking he starts making sexual advances on me I say no he replies with he will ''Shove his dick down my mouth''.

While whacking each other off I felt a barrage of sensations I had never experienced up to that point in my life the sheer amount of constant pleasure without having to touch myself.

It was just sex (or so he told me), but I knew his cheating was part of a moronic 'phase' my friends were going through, and he was so immature he couldn't end his affair properly (at some point he even considered pretending he had a terminal sickness and break all contact, I shit you not).

Fast forward a few days, because as it turns out she told me she had started to suspect she was being cheated on. My friend had been behaving strangely, disappearing for whole weekends, and he had also made the number one mistake of cheaters all around the globe: not only he was texting the other girl, but also wasn't deleting the messages and often left his cellphone lying around. So just a few days before our encounter she had picked the phone, read the texts and confronted him about them. She told me he denied everything, and either the texts were not clear enough or my friend is a damn good liar because he managed to make her doubt about the whole story.

That's when she asked me. She looked me in the eye, but I did know she was a good person who didn't deserve to be cheated on and lied about. So I told her the truth. Even after her suspicions she was devastated, so she called my friend the next day and broke up with him. No ifs, no buts, no second chances.

I never saw this girl again after that, but there's a part of me that is still scared of what would happen if he found out. I would do it again, though, because I still think what he did was absolutely despicable (not only the cheating, but also the mind games), and if we ever get to talk about this that's what I will tell him.

Tonight my boyfriend is gone for good. No dick is worth his problems. Before I had to go to work we got into an argument about how we had both agreed to get help together. He was going to go to an outpatient drug rehab program and I was going to either join a support group or see a therapist. Today, all he could do was stare at the wall.

When I went to work ( on less than an hour of sleep due to the stress ) he decided to do dope with his friends in our apartment. I have never been as strong as I was then. I told them all to get the fuck out and they scrambled. None of them could make eye contact with me. I was texting him at work out of worry that he may decide to do heroin today and he said he had

1348678908.0,10ijak,I've been fapping to pornographic pictures of my sister for weeks now and I can't stop.,fap2sister,148,49,68,"My older sister (me 19 her 21) attends an out of state college and lives on campus during the summer. I still live at home and commute to a nearby state college like a loser. A few months ago we were chatting online and she told me that she had broken up with the man she'd been dating since first moving out there a couple years back. She would not give any details but said that I should tell our parents cause it would make them happy. Sis and our parents don't get along very much and they really disliked this bf supposedly cause of the age difference (h'e over ten years older than her) but really cause he's Arabic and our parents our racists who think every arabic person is a terrorist.

Well not long after she broke up with him I got an e-mail one morning from someone I didn't know with the subject titled ""Your sweet and innocent sister Jane"" (her name isn't Jane but the e-mail did mention her real name). Normally I would have deleted it as spam but my sister's name is pretty unique so I figured I should check it out.

Three e-mails in total, my sister, doing everything you can imagine: sucking cock, fucking, cum shots, multiple guys at the same time. All amateur pictures so I don't think they're from a website or anything it's like whoever sent me the pictures took them himself. It's definitely Jane by the way either that or an evil twin we've never heard of who decided to get the same piercings and an identical tatoo on her right shoulderblade. 

At first I was horrified but I couldn't stop looking at them in spite of that. My sister was never very wild or slutty when she lived here at home in fact she dated the same clean cut boy all through highschool before moving out of state. She got decent grades and still does not genius level or nothing but really good. Seeing her in these pictures makes me wonder WTF kind of relationship was she in with the Arabic guy? Did he know about what she was doing with all these men? Cause my guess is there's at least nien different guys between all these pictures. In some you can't see their faces so it's hard to tell.

Why was she doing this? Only a few of the pictures look like they could have been taken secretly the rest it'd be impossible to hide the camera and in a lot of them she's actually playing to the camera like winking or smiling directly into the lense. Was she getting paid to do all this? Just doing it for fun? Or was she being forced somehow?

Okay so now the big question- who sent me these pics? Obvious answer is the ex-bf. I don't know why they broke up exactly but I got the feeling from the chat with Jane that it was not a cordial breakup. Now I only met him once when she brought him home once for a holiday last year but it turned out he played on Steam too and we hit it off talking about videogames. I even gave him my s/n and e-mail address so we could play together. Never really happened but he did have that info. Also he could have gotten my e-mail address from e-mails my sister sent to both of us which she has done before.

First thing I should have done was delete these e-mails and tell my sister about them but I didn't. Instead I've been fapping to them all the time. I have a girlfriend and she just said a few days ago that she thinks I might be cheating on her because I have no sex drive. I have no sex drive because I'd rather fap to pictures of my sister being a total slut than fuck her! It's sick. I know that. But when I try to delete the pictures I just can't.

This situation has me confused as fuck. I feel guilty, pathetic, you name it. Not to long ago I was chatting with Jane about an upcoming family thing and I actually typed out something like ""I know you sent me your slut pictures"" but thankfully I didn't send the message. But see that's one of my fantasies to, that she sent me the pictures herself! Fucked up so fucked up.

My long term girlfriend has been gradually gaining weight and I am not attracted to her the way I used to be. Thus, even inviting another woman into the mix, both of which she shot down. All of these I used as justification for cheating.   

On a lark

Along with the slew of bots, was one very real, and very crazy female. We started exchanging emails over the course of a week. I never intended to follow through, just knowing I had options was a thrill for me.   

The email chain got stranger

Last night, and we smoked pot and popped painkillers til 5:30AM this morning. I have never abused pills in my life. The entire night was one huge warning sign. She exhibited paranoid, schizophrenic behavior, rambling, and general nonsensicalness. It felt like an out of body experience. I kept feeding this girl pills as she demanded them, claiming they weren't working. I think she may have downed up to 15 of them total. I was actually scared the whole time I was there. I knew I was being used for drugs, but if I was gonna get laid

She demanded I go down on her first. I did. Then I tell her its my turn. She says she has a sore throat now. I tell her try anyway, tells me its time for me to go, that we are going to get caught.    

As she's rushing me out of her window, so she doesn't feel like she blew me for them. I know full well she has no intentions of paying me now, or ever. I tell her don't worry about it. Keep them. She says just give me a price, cut me a deal. I said fine $10 bucks. She says I'll write you a check. I say forget it, just take them.     

This wasn't enough. Now she says aren't you going to leave me some pot? I said ""No

She texts me furiously, why I would trick her and then run away. Fact is, she wasn't tricked. I was so desperate to get out of there and afraid of what she might do, that I just wanted to give her the pills to shut her up. 

I get home at 6AM, grab a 45 minute power nap before I have to get up for work. I wake up to find a slew of texts from this girl. At first furious, then apologetic, then confused, all of them totally fucked up. I still have yet to respond.       

She knows my real name. She has pictures of me. She has my phone number.    

I feel dirty. I feel ashamed. I feel unworthy of the girl I've been with for 3 years. I feel entirely empty. Here I sit, still feeling the effects of the 7 painkillers I took last night.    

I've never felt like less of a human being than I do right now.   

Thank you for letting me get this off of my chest. There is nothing that can erase what I have done. I know this entire episode was wrong and could have/ should have been avoided. I'm afraid of what might happen next

My dad, too, had an alcohol issue.  But I'm too smart to let myself get sucked into that.  Yea, I know what's going on, I can stop before I have a problem.  That's what I thought anyway.

I went through a stressful time about a year ago and started drinking more.  I didn't think anything of it when I began drinking alone.  It started on the weekends when I would lay out by the pool by myself and have a glass of wine.  Just one glass, and it had become part of my normal routine.  

I didn't think anything of it when I started having a constant, and I would dread driving to work.  One morning I thought ""oh yea, I'll just have one beer before the drive to get me through the morning.""  Then it was 2.  Then it was every morning.  I don't even want to think about how many times I drove when I shouldn't have...I am ashamed and still feel like such utter scum.  

I played soccer on a local adult team, but I was so sure that the drinks made me more coordinated and less afraid of the ball.  How I didn't break my (or someone else's) leg, I'll never know.

During the work day, I hid bottles of 'water' around my closet...they were actually full of vodka, I could sneak a swig every now and then.  

Eventually, but he got on my case and started pressuring me to not drink as often.  When I went to a doctor for an unrelated issue, I discovered I had liver damage...reversible, but far beyond what a normal 24 year old should have.  I was literally killing myself, and thought nothing of it.

Over time, I would drink once because I wanted it, then again to make the feeling go away.  Later, when I'd pull clothes off the shelves, I'd find empty bottle after empty bottle, hidden in pockets and folds and shoes.

One night I suppose I'd gotten drunker than normal

When I woke up and read what I'd written, and so miserable.  I couldn't remember anything I ever did, and I realized that I was dragging myself into an early grave.  Every good thing in my life was being pushed away because I wanted to feel something, and all I felt was numb.  I was using the alcohol as some sort of band aid for a problem I didn't have...I was actually making the problem I was avoiding.    

It's been a hard road since then, and I am able to love unhindered.  I feel happiness and sadness and anger full force, and though it can be scary, it's real, and I love it.  I am prettier now...my skin is clear and my eyes aren't bloodshot and my smile is genuine.  

When my bf finally did start to see me sober, and I did sweet things more often.  I could actually remember things we did together, and jokes he made, and stopped falling asleep in the middle of late night conversations.

We kept having slumber parties over the course of a year or two and kept making out with each other as dares, but we did do ""red rocket"" stuff to dogs.

Around this time, I was humping a stuffed animal and caught him hiding in my room, watching me. He pulled it off like it was a prank when I caught him and never brought it up again. Then I would catch him hiding my closet after school. It got to a point that whenever I wanted to get off, I would search my room for him to make sure he wasn't there.

When I was in middle school, I heard my stepdad yell ""I know you're out there! It's not funny!"" and apparently thought my brother had been blocking the dish to interrupt the reception when my stepdad watched TV as a joke. I looked at my window and saw my brother running away.

I met her 5 years ago and it was love at first sight. At that time, as of present time, she's in a 3 year relationship with a man.) I vowed never to tell Almond my feelings because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. I was so head over heals, just being her friend was good enough. So I held my feeling in, denied it some days, because I knew it'll ruin everything.


We eventually became roommates in college. One particular girl in our program (we'll identify as Peanut) became increasingly attached to Almond (who can blame her, but has since come out of the closet. She also fits 12 of the 20 symptoms for a psychopath (mainly manipulativeness). Almond started letting Peanut get really close, and before I knew it, Peanut was sleeping over in our dorm every night.


This is where it gets really painful. Peanut was doing everything I never had the guts to: Whispering sweet nothings in Almond's ear. Kissing her. Telling her how beautiful she was. Making her giggle by just lightly running her fingers down the small of Almond's back. Some nights I couldn't sleep in my own bed because I'll hear those two. This went on for months. They never called it a relationship. I saw it more as a dirty little game Peanut like to play.  Almond would confess to me that she didn't like how Peanut was getting attached to her, Almond would let Peanut carry on. I didn't know what to do. So I didn't do anything. Coward.


I can't say for certain if those two had sex. Almond would deny it if ever asked. Eventually, roommates, I share everything with her (except this secret). I still love her, but I've been able to channel it more into a friendship-type love. There's nothing she can do to hurt me, not after how much I hurt myself to get through the whole Peanut fiasco. 


Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice to keep my feeling bottled up. If our friendship is worth just one night with her.

He's that classic best friend; we can tell each other anything, we had a few mutual friends. I always saw X as the older guy that was cute, but knew it wouldn't happen. I didn't think we'd end up as best friends, either. It wasn't much, just a dumb high school crush. Nothing would come of it.


Over time we became friends. Not really close, and he's my best friend. I spent this entire summer hanging out with X and our circle of friends. He's told me things he would never tell anyone, and I've told him things I couldn't tell anyone. It's great, I've never had as close a friend. This is where it gets kind of complicated, though.


A month or so ago I remembered the high school crush I had on my now best friend. Later, getting a crush on your straight friend is a recipe for disaster. He's not gay or bi at all, but it doesn't stop me from hoping. I know it will never happen, but I want to pick up on signals that aren't there. The little, cute things he does. I don't even want to notice them. I don't want to like him like this. I can't help feeling this way.


If you're still reading


Last night we're all hanging out. This had been bugging me for a little while, she told me her problems, and I unloaded my problem. I didn't want anything more than to just tell her, just so somebody knows. It was stressing me out, especially since I was drinking around X. She promised not to tell anybody.


The biggest problem with falling for your straight best friend isn't the fact that you're crushing on someone you know you can't have. It's not even the anxiety you get whenever you're around him, it would change everything about our group. I want so badly to just tell him, hoping for a chance of something more, if not just to put the issue to rest. But it doesn't work like that, it would change the dynamics of our whole circle of friends.


Y and I head back inside after our long, and I'm pretty drunk myself. Of course the only thing on my mind is that I like him, especially after the conversation I had with Y just minutes earlier. It quickly becomes apparent he's got something on his mind, and he wants to tell me something.


Let me preface this: I would never betray a friend's trust


He says he wants to tell me something he's never told anyone. He starts to tell me about an anxiety he has, and have a girlfriend. Someone he can tell anything to, who he can be close with and tell everything. I'm dying on the inside.


I'm sitting there, even though I know it won't happen. I feel selfish for even thinking this while he's confiding something like that in me.


We talk for a little while longer as we smoke. All the while I’m falling apart on the inside, he cries a little bit more, and we go inside.

At one point I had finally made one friend that lived three houses from me, that summer we played together frequently and I remember being so happy to have a friend that lived so close.  

Like I mentioned earlier, never uttering a word.  Everyone knew of him, but no one knew anything about him.  He was just the resident creeper.

So my new friend and I were playing outside one summer, and suspecting that someone was listening to us so I warned my friend to lower her voice.  But she wasn't scared of anything.  Egged on by my warning, I think, she started talking even louder.  Then she told me, in a mock hushed voice, that she heard the ""creepy fucker"" ate roaches.  

After that, which was news to us) barreling out of that man's house and screaming at us.  I was terrified, but my friend was a spitfire, she yelled back at them despite the obvious age and size gap.  They slapped her, then pushed her to the ground and began kicking her head.  One of them dragged her back to her feet and held her in a choke hold.  The other girl came for me, but before she could get to me, my friend yelled something insulting to her, all the while she was screaming for me to run home.  

I'll never forget her voice, and didn't look back.  I never told my parents because I was convinced the two girls would give me the same treatment they gave to her.  I should have.  I should have said or done something, ANYTHING.  Because I never saw her again.  After a week of being afraid to leave my house, I looked for her, as much as an 8 or 9 year old could.  Her parents never answered the door again and I believe they eventually moved.  I don't know what happened to her.  I don't know if she's even alive.  

All I remember about this girl is that she saved me from an unknown fate that day.  The memory of her has since grown fainter and fainter,False,,t5_2qo2a,False,,,t3_tosjs

I've been dancing ever since I was a little girl. When I was 5, I would simply feel sick to my stomach.

This isn't even all of it.

All of this and my mental illness aside (obsessive compulsive disorder) I'm a a pretty normal person. People don't usually associate anything sexual with me because I am very calm and serious. 

I recently entered a very serious relationship with a great guy and I opened up to him about most of this (I left some of the things I did when I was a teenager out because I know he wouldn't react well to it) and he shares similar kinks and turn ons because he was taken advantage of when he was younger. However

The good news is that with personal insight and time I've managed to put most of it behind me. I admit what happened to me and I admit the things I have done. I have attempted to repent to people but only a couple have actually responded. I have hurt a lot of people and I don't think I can ever forgive myself for that but I'm trying my best to move on.

When she answered she asked me why I was there like she had completely forgotten she asked me over. She took longer than usual to let me in. When I got to her apartment door she blocked me from walking straight in then questioned me about again.

I sat down and wrote this out two days ago but chickened out of posting it under my main Reddit handle. I've read it back to myself over and over again

I'm engaged to a man with three teenaged boys

To provide some background

I honestly can't imagine not having him by my side every day. But his relationship with his kids is fucking neurotic. I'm not exaggerating

The youngest is 13 and tries to be a loveable kid, will tie his shoes if he's asked, practically dresses the boy in the morning and reminds him when to go to the bathroom. I'm not talking about at night. I mean during the day, he tells him when to go to the fucking bathroom. Just as bad, the kid won't sleep in his own bed half of the time and my fiance randomly picks him up and carries him around like he's a baby. 

Sadly, because as soon as he gets that hurt look on his face, his dad caves. 

On New Years Eve he wanted $200 to go to the mall and his dad gave it to him because it was “easier that way.” I just about hit the fucking roof but I kept my mouth shut for the sake of peace. When he doesn't get his way

The oldest might be the most damaged of the three. He just turned 18 and can't make a decision without asking his dad first. Before I met him, but in different ways. He likes to come downstairs every morning and hang on his dad. They cook breakfast together and the entire time, he's hugging on his dad and telling him he loves him. I think it's okay to love your dad, but the degree to which he does it is just creepy. 

The other day we were talking alone about which college he wants to attend next year

The four of them have a night time routine where they all sit in a giant cluster on the couch and talk about their day. This is the point in the day where the boys talk about their feelings and their dad dotes all over them. They hug

I hit my breaking point over Christmas break. The 13 year old and the 18 year old had the flu and it was like life stopped in the house for two days. Instead of keeping them in their rooms where the germs would be contained, checking their temperatures and tending to them so much that they started to get annoyed with it. At some point he decided that they should sleep in their own beds after all, so he goes downstairs and carries the 13 year old to his bed. 

Okay

Then he goes back downstairs and comes upstairs with the fucking 18 year old slung over his fucking shoulder. I had to blink because I couldn't fucking believe what I was seeing. He sets the kid down in front of the bathroom and tells him

The fucking kid is 5'8 and probably weighs 150 pounds! I swear to God it was all I could do to keep my composure and not walk out on him. I know he loves his boys, but this is too much. When I told him that I made an appointment for us to go to premarital counseling, he got upset and demanded to know why. I just told him that we have some things that we need to talk about before we get married in July. He's fiercely protective over his boys and I'm afraid that things aren't going to end well.

First of all thanks SO much to you guys' comments and support

Alright

Last night I organized Hayley to take my mother for a relaxing dinner and movie and then gently explain to her what was happening that night with me and her son. 

Meanwhile

I produced to him the terms and conditions for him living under our roof. They were nonnegotiable until a two week trial period had expired and Hayls and I looked over the rules and his behavior etc etc. Charlie said he didn't want my boss here because it was embarrassing because I was treating him like a kid. I said that he was the reason my boss was here because of his behavior

The rules went like this (btw I'm typing this on my iPhone so PC formatting may be weird) 
•Charlie will either take the part-time job offered to him by my boss at his cousin's work or find a job on his own
•Charlie does not have to attend university if he doesn't want to
•Charlie's gaming hours will be condensed to 4 hours a day with the exception of birthdays and Christmas 
•Charlie will pay $50 rent a week to us. If he doesn't pay up within two days after the due payment day his console will be taken off him until he coughs up the cash
•Charlie will recognize that he does not pay equal share to the apartment and that Hayley and I will have the final word over the conditions and whether he's met them. He is also not to physically or verbally abuse us unless he wants to have his ass bruised by our door. 

I was firm and to the point, though I didn't bring this up to him. He started to have a tantrum and left for his room, where he spent all last night. 

When I came back from work four hours ago Hayley had been home with Charlie all day, watched a movie with my girlfriend, and am currently lying in bed relaxing, enjoying the silence.

I've been with my wife, been married for just over one. I love my wife dearly. She's beautiful, supportive, and has a great career. We have our ups and downs, like any couple, but I'm very happy I have her in my life. Our biggest problem is communication. She has a lot of anxiety issues and takes them out on me in the form of anger and yelling. She recently started medication and is doing worlds better. All this to say, our biggest problem is slowly starting to get behind us

When I first met my Katie's sister, Sara and I were almost a perfect fit. We both have a passion for music, can discuss religion and politics for hours on end having some great conversations, and even when we disagree on something (which is rare) we still stay friendly and have a good time. We enjoy playing video games, have the same since of humor, enjoy same type of TV shows and movies.... yadda yadda yadda, you get the idea. Perfect fit for a friendship.

Well as time went on, I would skip going over all together.

I don't know exactly how or what started it, and myself just waking up from falling asleep as well. I was waiting to find the energy to get up and go home when I heard the moans of Sara from the other room. Her and her boyfriend were going at it like crazy, and I listened to her moaning and screaming for minutes until she hit orgasm. I was insanely aroused.

So for years now I've been attracted to Sara. I fantasize about her constantly. I've run through a million scenarios in my head, If the situation ever came up to sleep with her, I know I would. If we were hanging out and she hinted at making a move, I would chase it. If I got a text out of the blue at 1:00am in the morning to come over to her house because her place, I wouldn't think twice. Sleeping with her is something I've wanted for so long I know that, in the heat of the moment, I could never turn it down.

The thing of it is, her personality, her body, our shared sense of humor, our passions in music, our thoughts on the world, I'm attracted to almost everything about her. So much so that sometimes I wonder if I'm in love with her. Sometimes I wonder if I would have actually been better off if I ended up with Sara instead of my wife. 

Like I said, or if I ever lost her, I would just be devastated. I'm devoted to her and always try to be a great and supportive husband. But the fact remains I have an undeniable attraction to her sister, and would give almost anything for a chance to be with her. Could be love, could be just lust... could be both. I don't know.

I don't know what to make of all this. Part of me tries to justify it and say it's okay because we can't help who we are attracted to

I grew up in a conservative, etc. I'm sure this is not uncommon in the South. 

I never dated in high school. My one and only relationship was as a 19 year old during my second year of college. I always felt uncomfortable about it because we attended the same Church

Since then I have attracted a few attractive girls, but I gave up that fantasy a long time ago. We make our own luck. We control our own destiny. The way we think our lives will play out is rarely accurate. 

The main problem is I still have the same sexual urges as all men my age. I am by no means asexual. I just can't bring myself to fornicate, but I never hang out with them. I see my family sparingly. People miss me and enjoy being around me. Like I said before, I am able to attract women with my easy going nature. I come off as confident because I am never trying to hit on girls to get their number. Women pick up on this, and it attracts them. So I could get a girl, I just dont want to. But I do. But I really dont. Fucking shit. 

I feel like my life is passing me by

Eventually I will lose my hair and my looks. I'll end up all alone because I never learned how to coexist with a mate. Most days my situation doesn't bother me. I am not depressed. I have goals. I eat well and no longer drink or smoke anything. I'm just empty. I feel like I am wasting my life sometimes and it scares me. My uncle never dated much. I am very much like him. He died alone in his apartment after falling down the stairs and breaking his neck. He laid there rotting for three days before anyone even noticed he was dead. The neighbor called the property manager because of a strange smell emanating from his apartment. I don't want that to be me. 

Anyway

Edit: I think part of the problem is that I've grown up without the lifestyle of being in a relationship. I don't know how to do it.

I was on his computer one day, and even incest stuff. Some of the stuff I saw was pretty violent, and lots included rape. I was immediately disgusted and just turned the computer off.

When we were younger - to my protest - he used to put his hands up my leg as 'a game'. It may be an irrational fear, but I'm scared he'll do something to me now. The looks (not the way a brother is supposed to look at you) are getting more frequent. I'm constantly scared he'll do something, or do something to a child. I don't want to tell anyone, as I know he could go to jail for having them, one day he might do something.

They got married 2 years later. She still endlessly aroused me but I could control it much better. At one point I had a job offer where they lived (a couple hours north) but turned it down because I didn't trust myself around her. She never flirted or acted inappropriately but I spent every minute in her presence fighting the urge to stare. Or worse touch. 

They got divorced last year. I tried to be there for my brother, grew up best friends. I would do anything for him, but he's a flawed guy. Even from his side I could tell he had mistreated her, and she left him. The guilt got bigger as I found myself happy she was single. He quickly started dating the girl she had caught him sexting with. 

I considered contacting her but knew it was wrong and didn't. I focused on my life, and would get ridiculously happy when she 'liked' my post. I battled myself with urges to contact her. I loved how she handled her divorce with grace and dignity. I loved how she never posing for pictures and seems to be laughing in every single one.

I made another profile and took it easier. She wrote back! We started talking! I lived to hear from her

It lasted two months, it was everything I ever wanted. But, I finally realized that I was being a jerk and told her I lied about what I looked like and told her good-bye. She's such an angel she tried to give 'me' another chance after that.

I helped her out and she moved in with me after about 6 months. Things went ok until my work laid people off due to the recession. I was spared until she did a few things in front of my boss that pissed him off off which indirectly (or maybe directly) lead to me being fired after working there for 8 years as the head of their regional office.

The city we lived in was hit hard by the recession so finding work was difficult. She has a house on the other side of the country and we decided to move out there to look for work and so that she could be near her mother who had terminal cancer.

I found a great paying job after only a month and started working with a great bunch of people. She became less and less affectionate and more withdrawn and spent the entire day on the couch or sleeping.

She had been an occasional weed user for years and I never really had much an issue with it since she used it for some chronic illnesses and that was ok with me. I never used it and it didn't seem to bother her.

This went for about 10 months and I just let it happen because I didn't want to make an issue about it.

Ever since the abuse I've been replaying the scene in my head, just of oral sex). I'm not blaming the abuse on my interest in porn, I have taken responsibility for that. She is deeply religious and hated me for it, and I nearly fell apart when she threatened to take my children away ,whom I spend every waking minute with and love more than life itself.

I came from a single parent background, she would , knowing her blame herself, and she has been to hell and back over 50 years. Despite this I managed to get myself through University and forge a career as a Director of a large department with a turnover of around £30m, and written a few books all by the age of 32

I still believe in God, and many of my friends are becoming increasingly religious, leaving me isolated to a degree.....not sure how to move forward on this...

I'm a big guy now(6ft 3) and I feel nothing but sheer hatred for the sick bastard that raped me, but I always swore I would protect my kids, and not end up putting my son and daughter through a life of growing up without a dad.... but I constantly think I need to come forward and help protect other children in case he is still out there doing it...no matter the cost to my life....

I really don't know what to do, I'm not sure my wife wouldn't leave, and I would rather die than end up just seeing my kids on the weekends, and not be with them every moment I have, its the only thing I feel I have really achieved, is being a good dad, at least I hope I am.

By the time I'd entered middle school it was clear that there was just no hope of recovery, and my mom wanted me to spend time with her. It was important to her that I meet my grandmother while there was anything left to meet. So every Tuesday after school, I had to visit my grandmother. Sometimes my mother would go with me, but usually I would go alone.

It's hard for me to talk about what I did. I'll try to type it out though. I'm crying now remembering all of this and I feel sick. I literally have a pain that feels like part of me was just taken out. The guilt is horrible. Well, and I was just... I just did it.

I know the title makes it sounds like I am just denying that I am gay, but not very often at all, and as I've gotten older I have had them less and less. I've watched a decent amount of porn and have never watched gay porn or been interested in watching it. The thing is, I just really like and want to have sex, and so far have been unsuccessful with girls.

So a few years ago. I was in high school, which we had only done a few times before. I really wasn't that high though, and I don't think he was either. Basically, he came on to me and asked if we wanted to trade blowjobs. As a sexually frustrated kid who really wanted to know what that felt like, I accepted. I really hated giving it, but receiving it felt very good. I was ashamed for a while about it, but I kind of realized it doesn't matter much. We had one more encounter (he again asked first) a few months later and have hardly ever spoken about it since. He has had many girl friends since then I am pretty sure he is (mostly) straight like me. I feel like if I had a girl during this time, again
  
About a year later I started becoming better friends with a new guy. He eventually admitted that he was gay. Somehow the topic came up and, this past summer (about 2 years after the first encounter), he asked me if I'd want to do it again. I accepted. We had about four or five of these encounters in total. To be honest, every time it happened, I didn't enjoy it that much, but then afterwards, I'd be craving to do it again. And again, I would not have accepted.   
  
My friends aren't necessarily homophobes, neither of the two partners I had have either. Sometimes I look back with regret, sometimes I look back and figure ""hey, no harm done"".  I honestly didn't enjoy the encounters with guy #2 all that much, but my mind said ""hey, its better than no sex"", so I guess that is why I kept going back. Sometimes I really crave it and consider asking him if he'd like to do it again (which he probably would)

How strong? I truly didn't know myself, and I couldn't see myself separated from them. I knew she was taking too many pills but I overlooked the problem as long as she made it to work and such. We both had relatively good paying jobs, and lived in the 3 bedroom house I purchased before our marriage. I could see the impact it was having on her however, and especially on the children. I made the decision to take all of her medications away from her, and give her only the amount prescribed by the doctor. I thought if I could manage her habit, she could recover and we could be a family.


I am stupid apparently, and she went to live with her parents, while I went to live with mine. I got two visitations with my step-children, until one asked me ""why aren't you and mommy together""?  I made the mistake of telling him that I thought her medicines make her sicker, rather than better, and when she heard she disallowed visits. There is no law that allows a step-father any rights, no matter the length of his service.

I then made the demand that she attend rehab, and being glad when she chose that.

I was head over heels in love with a girl named Julie. We had been quietly dating for half a year when I began to get a case of the winter blues. I lost interest in everything and was only happy when I was around her. My poor mood began to get on her nerves
  
I was heartbroken. I had been living for her. Now
  
While I was playing WoW, closeted, gay dude who was also seriously depressed. Unlike me, he had a very hard time hiding his sexuality. Although it never became ""Facebook official"" or anything like that, we were in a very close relationship by the end of the month. 
  
Brent's roommates were not people he chose to live with. They were just a bunch of assholes the university decided to throw him with. They gradually began to harass Brent more and more for being gay. He didn't have the backbone to take it. I spent more than one night just being a shoulder for him to cry on. One night in early March, kissed him on the forehead and left. After I left, he slit his wrists in the shower and bled to death. One of his roommates found him later that night when the water had been running for too long.  
  
I didn't know what to do anymore. His family blamed me for Brent's death. They said I made him gay and wouldn't let me go to the funeral. I still don't know where he is buried. I had nobody to turn to. None of my friends had even met Brent more than once or twice and none of them knew about us. I had no way to explain to them what he meant to me without also outing myself. Needless to say
  
The very next night, I knew about the ending. (SPOILER ALERT: it ends with the fairy boy shooting himself in the head /END SPOILER) I sat through half of the movie before it finally got to me. I left, holding back tears, went outside and punched a brick wall for an hour. When I came back, I had broken most of my knuckles and could barely hold my glass. I didn't sleep that night. All I did was cry.  
  
The very next day, ""batting for the other team."" at the same time as he tried to stick me in the ass with the broom handle. This drove me into a 
rage. I snatched the broom away from him
  
It was the next day when I spoke to Brent's parents over the phone. They told me what they thought of me and why they wouldn't let me go to his funeral.   
  
At that point, I wandered out into the woods by our campus and found the sturdiest tree branch that was high enough. I jumped up and down on it just to make sure it would hold. Then I tied the noose on it and hung myself so that I was facing into the sunset.  
  
If anyone gets the idea to hang themselves, the seconds stretched into hours and the minutes stretched into days. My vision faded to black after what felt like a millenia.   
  
Then, I started to see a white light in the center of my vision. It was a bright light. Brighter than staring directly at the sun, but at the same time it wasn't painful. It was warm and numbing. As I struggled to free my neck, the white light grew brighter and grew. It grew until it surrounded me. When it did, I was no longer in pain. I no longer cared about Julie or Brent or anything that had happened to me. It felt like the white light was an impossible number of souls, all crammed together. I think this might have been God. I didn't have a body anymore. I was also one of these white specks. None of them greeted me. None of them cared that I was there. I didn't care either. I had no emotions at all. I was completely apathetic to everything. I could have been a Jew right next to Hitler and not had a care. At the same time, I had no love or joy. I felt like I had access to all of their collected wisdom (not knowledge
  
Then, but not quite the same. Then, I died again. This happened again and again for what felt like millions of times all in a few moments. I died and came back and died again. Each time, it felt like a little bit of another me came back with me and then each body felt different from the one before (I was probably having a stroke or something). The last time it happened, the push felt larger than before. I felt like I was blasted back into the dark of a body.

I moved away from my mother at the age of 10, to a hard drug user, eventually finding religion and becoming ""born again"". But despite her new found ""faith"", she remained just as cruel as ever. For her, God was a vengeful being, bent on revenge and punishment. In her twisted world view, Jesus had no problem with cruelty

Faithful to what exactly? I don't know. 

When I was in my early 20s I went to visit my mother, and decided to go for a hike like we used to. She was actually in a rather pleasant mood that day, and I had some important news to share- I was about to become a father myself. 

After an hour or so of hiking and talking about this news, and she agreed. 

I setup my camera hanging from a dead tree, and gestured for my mother to join me. She did. 

A moment later a green light blinked at us

Something that had been there all along. 

Something that is still deep inside me now. 

Without hesitation, off the edge. 

It was so surreal. She looked like Wile E. Coyote. I laughed. Not at her pain, and the chirps of frightened birds. 

I calmly hiked down and around, and I was amazed to find her sill alive, partially impaled on a stump. I'm no doctor, but there was a lot of blood. My guess is that she punctured a lung, because she couldn't talk, she could only drool blood and gurgle at me. 

I pulled out my cell phone- no bars. I wanted to stay, and called 911 as soon as I found some reception again. 

The operator had a sweet southern drawl

I rushed back to the body

To cut to the quick, so no one else really cared that she was dead, and no one had reason to suspect me, the sorrowful grieving son who had come to visit his mother like a good little boy, of anything. I never even took a polygraph- no one asked me to. 

So why am I telling this to you

Just a few minutes ago, was sent home from school early for brawling. And he came home to find me here in my home office, working, as I usually do. Eager to change the subject, he grabbed a photo that I leave on my desk and asked me about it. I grabbed it back away from him, and sent him off to his room. 

But after sitting here

Hes smart (really smart), just don't ask'. &gt;&lt;

I don't think he realizes the impact he has on me. Im putty in his hands for the most part and I hate the feeling of doing whatever he wants without getting what I want back. Part of me wants to say that he is only thinking of himself when he refuses to fool around or even more

The thing which is really hurting for me is that he is perfect for me, he raps, he's lots of fun. He's always got an idea for how to have fun. Meanwhile Im coolheaded, responsible, a planner. We have deep intellectual conversations which we can't have with anyone else. Sexually we're both huge perverts of nearly the same variety. He even thinks Im cute.

I thought I was too old for this. I don't know if Im falling in love or if having this guy so close to me is reminding me what it is like to have someone that close. Unfortunately, or maybe that my defences are too weak to have let him in that far.

My sister had pulled away my towel while walking back from the shower. Her friends were there and saw my junk. They were relentless. For years that's all I heard when they were over. I became bitter. I even hated the idea of sex because it would make me vulnerable. I started to fight a lot because I needed to assert my dominance because of how emasculated I felt. Know that annoying guy that will correct you if you say one thing wrong? That's me. Asserting my knowledge so you think I have more worth. Or so I thought. Turns out it just makes me look like an asshole. It's no wonder I have no friends at all. I avoided asking out any girl I found attractive. And when I had my first relationship I let it interfere with that. She put up with my insecurity like a champ for 3 years

Ads like Extenze don't help either. Or smiling fucking bob. Fuck you bob. Every time I turn on the TV I'm bombarded with the fact that women don't want a guy with a small penis and it makes me feel worthless. Beyond worthless.  Plus my best friend and all of his girlfriends constantly talk about his junk. Like I want to know that. 

I'm so fucking resentful and scared all the time because of it. 

The bright side is it's because of my weight. Fat guys have a layer of fat around the base of their dick that covers the bottom of the shaft. So my dick might actually be 6 or 7 inches hard

That was way longer than I expected it to be. But I've never told a single person how bad my insecurity is. Sure my ex kind of knew, and I have fun. I love my mind. I like to consider myself smart. But it still doesn't make up for the thing I desire most.  I really need to lose this weight.

When I was twelve my mom and I went to this church. They had this really nice little youth group with about fifteen of us. Well Martin Luther King Weekend, just being twelve.


The first night we got up there, I made my way to a couch. About 20 minutes into falling asleep I was pulled down to the floor by one of the boys. His name was Daniel and he was about 15. He was known to be a dick of sorts. No one really liked him too much. He started getting touchy with me and tried to put his hands up my shirt. Now to be honest, I am small breasted. And I look very young for my age. I will be able to pull off at least 18 until I am about 27. I don't really see his interest in 12 year old me. I was cute but very lanky.


I kept telling him no. He kept pushing. It was a bible trip


This really shock me hard because my mother was/is already very abusive. In public she would show me off like a prize dog, and how it was her good graces I wasn't on the street or in foster care. I used to spend so much time convincing myself how worthless I wasn't. She only said that because she was just mad. I just tried to justify her action by saying how bad I was and I deserved those words for whatever trouble I did cause but it was okay, because if I tried hard to be could be the perfect daught, and therefore she would stop.


Hearing that from him almost justified everything my mother ever said to me. Suddenly it made sense. They were both right. No one would ever want me. So I finally let him touch me
I know I am not worthless but that and how my mother treated me growing up really messed me up. I am constantly looking for people to tell me good things about myself


I am actually crying right now because rethinking about it really makes me feel terrible. I've only told two other people about it. My best friend

So, yet I didn’t tell or see anyone about it. Two weeks I spent worrying about whether this condition would be reversible, even scaring myself that it might be fatal, yet I didn’t do a thing.

Firstly: it was my ass. Not my bum, and I simply wasn’t comfortable showing that to anyone. And also - for some reason - on a subconscious level I felt shame over it. Perhaps because it was my ass and thus hard wired to my neural circuits in charge of everything ‘taboo’, but on a very deep level, I somehow believed it was my fault, that I deserved it, that it was a sign of some deep personal failing.

I've decided that I have to break up with my girlfriend because I can't do this to her or myself. I have lost my chance with the girl from the party because she found out I have a girlfriend and now thinks I'm a scumbag for hitting on her while I'm taken.

There it is

UPDATE: So I spoke to the girl from the party, we are on good terms now. I haven't broken up with my girlfriend yet as she's going on vacation in a few days and I can't bring myself to ruin it for her. When the time is right, I'll end my relationship and start talking to the girl from the party. Thanks for the advice, everyone. It helped a lot and I feel a lot better :)",,False,,1375797941.0,t3_1jp6cf
1375058660.0,1j8v5x,I pretend to be a girl online and It's destroying my life,throwaway0774,108,24,18,"Throwaway because this is my first time using Reddit and I don't know what I'm doing (though I've been lurking for a good few years).

So me, she, also lives with her abusive boyfriend. I don't have any friends, or even leave my home much. I don't even interact with my family really, detached from my mother and sisters, all who misunderstand me. In fact, I think everyone who knows me misunderstands me, doing nothing for most of that time. I'm not a mean person

Anywho, which led to more friends and it snowballed from there. I don't do anything sexual or anything that is gender-specific, but really just talk to them as who I really am, as if I weren't even a girl. I now have some friends who I've known for around 4 years now and I feel it'll be heart wrenching to them if I reveal to them who I really am. They haven't seen any pictures or heard my voice but take my word for it all, effectively earning their trust when I'm just lying to them.

Now, then I'll be left with no one, as they're my only friends I really have. Of course, I stopped going around as a girl when not around them and tried to make friends as such, but that has lead me down an empty road, still leading me back to the friends who know me as a girl.

What really put the cherry on top is a few days ago, and I do back her, but she knows me as a girl, not who I really am. It hasn't even been a week yet and she is making me think about all this time I've wasted pretending online to be someone who I am not and it's really depressing me into the depths of hell. I now feel like coming out to her (and my other friends) and most likely losing everyone because of my one stupid lie.

No one knows about me pretending about this, but a lonely kind of depression. I talk to people, quite a lot actually, but it's always about what they want to talk about. I don't know anyone who is near interested in the same things as me and it sucks.

Please excuse my bad typing, or to anyone else and I just want to let my life somehow and ease my burden.


TL;DR I'm a depressed person who wants to tell everyone I've lied to them for years and lose the only friends I have in my life.

Okay. I am 18 and my girlfriend is 17. We've been going out for about 4 months now. I recently found out that she used to be...ummm..'involved' with much older men during her younger teen years. It started out as her sending them pictures and videos from when she was about 12. This eventually evolved into her...'meeting' some of these men. This started when she was 13 and kept going until she was 15. She would sometimes even spend days at a time with these 'people'

When she told me, college etc.), but we've been texting and talking on facebook and stuff in that time. 

But whenever I think of her now, she's being fucked by them. I feel sick. Now the thought of anything sexual makes me feel ill and dirty. I even tried browsing some porn out of pure boredom but I immediately felt horrible and pictured her as those girls.

We met a year ago

We never made things official. Neither of us were seeing other people - I didn't want to and I believe him when he said he didn't want to.. but we still kept things slow, at the beginning of December, he asked. He just came out with it. Against all my better judgement, I said yes. Yes, lets make this official, even though we probably didn't need to declare it..

Against my judgement.. The thing is, hundreds of miles away and living with the guy she cheated on my boyfriend with.

Until two weeks before he asked me to officially be his girlfriend. Be exclusive. He told me, he mentioned his honeymoon, joked that the company was terrible even if the place was fantastic, and the conversation went on from there. So, he's not planning to get a divorce from her ever - for no other reason than he's *not bothered* about getting divorced from her and he can't be doing with the cost. He hinted slightly that she seemed to try to get money from him, but didn't expand much on this apart from her trying to get half his savings last year despite them having been separated for a long time.

This set something off in the back of my mind instantly, did realise.

This will be hanging over the relationship. Things wont be progressing. He acts serious about me, really, with us.. just being like this until it does. Separate. 

No moving in together. Ever. He's hinted that he likes the idea of us living together, our finances will overlap if we live together - at least if we buy shared items. Do I really want to be in that position? She will be there. And even disregarding the financial side of that, she will *still* be there hanging over this. 

Marriage. Now, with someone very right for me. But it wont even be an option in this case. Just a piece of paper or not, it wont be an option.

If things *do* get that far.. if I do find myself falling in love with this guy.. it wont be an option. That makes my stomach drop.

Do I want to risk that..

Do I really want to be in a relationship where, a relationship that seems to be getting quite serious, a relationship that really really *works*, but can still never progress?

Where I am girlfriend, knowing that will *definitely* never happen.. even if things work brilliantly and I fall head over heels, **when I could be free and single to find someone who will* be open to calling me that one day?** Who could love me as I love them? Someone I can even just move in with if that worked? Someone where the relationship can progress.. ?

I decided no. I can't do this. This relationship is going to end anyway. With no progression.

But I said yes anyway. He asked. I was shocked. My mind did some very hectic thinking on the spot. I said yes.

Why?

I wanted a bit of happiness. I'm being utterly selfish. It's near Christmas, to avoid him buying me any when I'm just going to leave him. That was a lie too. I bought him the fancy version of a new Android tablet - something he wanted, but couldn't afford right now. Figured that even if he's pissed about my lie, doesn't fucking matter because I'm breaking up with him soon after Xmas anyway and he wants the tablet so he's going to have it.

So... that's that. I'm lying to him. I'm leading him along. I'm lying to myself. Heck, I'll be able to pretend that I'm not in his wifes shadow, and that this relationship has not come to a pointless end before it's even begun.

We live in a really hot and humid area and it was a french lop rabbit, rabbits can be outside, not much shade at all.

So, the whole deal. My boyfriend went in a vacant area across the street and was my look out. When the coast was clear, I ran over to the porch with my face hidden (just in case they had video surveillance) and I grabbed the cage with the rabbit inside and wobbled my way to our backyard and then inside the house. I didn't expect the cage to be so big, so my plan of running with it did not work out very well. It was still a small cage for the rabbit, but I definitely had trouble carrying it back.

Luckily we had planned this out in advance

Anyways


Now, you wouldn't know that it had owners. They let her roam the streets, leave her out all day, and let her get infested with fleas. I bought her some flea medicine and applied it one night when she was outside - the fact that I could do that undetected should let you know her ""owners"" could give a shit less about her. I already bought food for her and give her water daily. She is still filthy but we need to line up a home for her before we steal her and give her a bath and everything. Again, we can't keep the animal, but we do want her to find a better home. She basically lives outside. I noticed she's not scratching as much, so the flea medicine worked and I have more if need be.

Anyway, I never force anything. It's only ever happened once I realized that we've become close and they want something more, even if only once. That's when I push all respect for myself, the girl, and her boyfriend, out the window. It's now just about making something happen.

To address anyone feeling sympathetic towards me here: I've ruined relationships. Broken hearts. Caused terrible situations that I don't think I'd even be able to hold my sanity through myself if I were in different shoes. To make things worse, it's an argument, or an overly dramatic final word. Each girl I've been involved with I wound up never speaking to again.

**mini TL;DR** I make people cheat and then get mad when they reject me.

examples:

- My second girlfriend: had a boyfriend of 3 years. He was 2 years older, and she went from friend to SO to girlfriend. We dated for a year. She ended up getting back with him after.
- Next was a hippie chick I met through protest. She had a boyfriend, she felt guilty, broke up with her boyfriend of a little over a year, and went out with me for 3 months until I left her without giving reason. My own insecurity got to me. This happens often.

*Skipping ahead a bit...*

- A girl I knew through university. Her boyfriend was mentally and physically abusive. I'm a good person, the guy has her around his finger. Knowing that tears me apart... but I tried my best and fucked it up when I probably could have helped her further had I not exploited her.
- Next girl is the best friend of the last. She's been going out with a guy for about 6 months at this point. Her and I have known each other for 2 years. We've been great friends. We had so many nice times together. But when I started to notice that she was seeking my attention more and more often, then holding hands, then I'd kiss her cheek goodbye at the end of the day. Then she started coming over my place.. and so on. Finally, the guilt kicked in for her, and she cut things off. Self-defence kicked in for me, and I told her I never want to see or hear from her again. I lost an amazing friend.

- The most recent girl actually changed my life. With her, but recently rekindled the friendship. The feeling was the same for her; I saw her like nobody else saw her before. We had all these disgusting problems in common for one. Naturally, we grew onto each other. Needless to say, she had a boyfriend. One of a year and 6 months. Regardless, we ended up getting closer, and slowly started really seeing each other behind his back. Skip ahead, we had sex in the end. It was after that, that her guilt kicked in, once more, but it's over. That's that

**Side note: I did, the devil in me was nowhere to be found, as I was getting the validation--just what I wanted. However, as they were all in previous commitments, things inevitably went bad, and that's when the fights/arguments/drama occurred.**

I don't know how to end this. I guess that's because it's a confession.

**TL;DR** I'm insecure and so I exploit/take advantage of girls in lengthy

Thoughts?

Edit: I'm very open to criticism. I'm not asking for you to tell me that everything's going to be okay. I know that I'm an asshole and a lot of people hate me or would hate me. I want your honest thoughts

Edit 2: I'm considering expanding this to incorporate how this whole problem effects me
&lt; did it.

My whole life, and I can really express myself if I'm having an intimate moment with someone. What's the trouble? I can't get in that kind of situation. Not ethically or honestly. I'm a parasite--I leech off of decaying relationships and make them my own. Because it's easy, at least for me. To be clear, I know how morally wrong and disgusting this is. That's why it gets to me. Phony or stolen relationships making up my love life, I'm consistently disgusted with myself. I don't do this for enjoyment.. I do it for validation. I see that this problem will likely always be a problem, and I'll only end up hurting myself, and more importantly, if I continue. But all I want is happiness. Knowing that I'm stuck in this, smoking cigarettes (my two scapegoats). I'm terrified of death, and one other thing


Don't even get me started on my dead-end life outside of all of this...

It made me sick to think that if I dared to tell anyone what happened it would be met with instant doubt, but your rapists athletic abilities mean far more to them than the crime he committed. 

It was a long time ago, so let me start the real story by saying fuck you. I was drunk. My top was low cut because I did want attention from boys. But I wasn't so blackout drunk that I don't remember saying no, and just because I wanted people to look does mean they had consent to do more than I wanted them to. 
 
I wanted to makeout with the football star. I did consent to that. I willingly went to that empty room with him. I absolutely did try to give him a hickey. I let him go under the bra. However I did not give him permission to put his fingers inside of me. I said no the second his hand got too high up on my thigh for my taste. I stopped kissing and tried to pull away. He didn't let me. He didn't stop at fingers. 

I'm doing okay now, but who knows if he'll respect that? So far, I've been lucky. I've built up and had successful, fulfilling, and committed sexual relationships. But somewhere in my subconscious, I fear that I'll meet another who won't take that's enough as answer.

I also thought my cat was trying to tell me things. I finally went to live with my mother telling no one anything because even at my most unhinged I recognized that telling anyone would result in at best going to a doctor (which I loath) or getting psychiatric treatment.  I was absolutely convinced there were 3 levels in people comprised of angels and demons and that greek gods from mythology inhabited everyone and were looped through native american folklore in a way I can only barely remember enough to comprehend unless I really tried which I am reluctant to.  Essentially every mythology or folklore I ever read interwove and made a very very detailed web of heightened belief in my head.

The sex life with my girlfriend of six years has been on a steady decline, and is now close to non-existant. She caught me watching porn a couple of times, it made her feel horrible and I promised I would cut down on it but I haven't. My secret life has been driving us apart. She feels unattractive because I have lost interest in her sexually.

After every binge I feel like shit. I've been getting more and more anxious. I've started going late to work every day to stay at home to masturbate. I've done it with my girlfriend sleeping in the same room. I now feel anxious for most of my waking hours and I avoid interacting with people because of my anxiety / shame. I have become a chronic procrastinator at work. I am losing the ability to enjoy the things I used to enjoy. I know this isn't healthy

A psychiatrist gave me anti-depressants. They muted my anxiety and replaced it with indifference. I lost my libido but not my habits. After 3 weeks I stopped taking the medication because I felt robotic. Haven't visited the psychiatrist since.

Age, profession, life experiences, and I think that contributed to it. I should note here that throughout the entire year that we spoke

I told myself that I wouldn't get attached, and later school, looking into the eyes of this beautiful girl every night. Told each other everything. Talked about everything. Helped each other with everything. I fell in ""love"", or the closest you can get to love with a video screen.

one night we were both drunk and had sex without a condom. the next morning she was a bit worried that I might have HIV and I'll admit I was concerned of the opposite ( this area of the world is endemic so it was a bit frightening)

so I suggested we got tested together. results negative on both counts (neither of us were surprised but its nice to be sure of the other)

but I digress.

so we keep seeing each other and the use of protection wasn't as solid as it should have been.

she pointed out that she had been with her ex for 2 years and never got pregnant

i wasn't too worried because it took two years of trying when I was with my ex years and years earlier before she got pregnant - and I knew i _had_ had lazy sperm.

well as all things do my holidays came to an end.

And I had to return home (having already booked my next set of holidays to go back and see her)

I left the day before her period was due - (and if you doubt things - I was there the last time her period arrived

it didn't come.

so we waited for a while longer.

and a while longer.

and it still didn't come.

I told her not to worry.

I told her I would look after her no matter what.

she already has two kids and doesn't want more until I can be with her forever.

I sat through the scans  via skype and looked at the little acorn on screen. 

I told her no matter what I'd be here for her.

unfortunately it'd take at least two years before I could begin the process of bringing her to my country... 

because I'm married and it would take that long for a divorce to go through.

and I couldn't find a job in her country fast enough.

and it'll be six months before I'm back there (coincidentally - i would have been there for the due date)

so yesterday she had a scan at the hospital and was given the meds.

today she went in and had the baby terminated.

I'm now crying because I don't agree with abortion - on a personal level

when I was staunchly atheist I realised that aborting was removing the only chance at existence that someone would have - and if that had happened to me I would have never had the blessing of concioussness.

these days I'm more open minded but have no strong religious beliefs (just that I know that I know nothing )

but I was really preparing to drop everything in my life

and I still am. but my second son or daughter will never be born

because I'm a cunt who cheated constantly on his wife while away overseas, help with homework, help grow and maybe be a postive influence on the world.


my love overseas is happy to wait

so she will wait until I can be there in person

and thats what I'm going to do. and yet I feel nothing for my wife - except I want a way to break up with her that hurts the least.


TL;DR - I'm an uncaring cock who got another chick pregnant whilst married. I want to be with the other chick overseas and not with my wife. chick I got pregnant had a (albeit logical and practical reasons) abortion. I feel like shit because I was looking forward to meeting my child.

I'll start from the beginning. Growing up I had a terrible relationship with my father. He was very verbally and physically abusive towards me. My parents weren't divorced or separated so I lived with him. He worked nights and my mom during the day, which he treated immensely better. This created jealousy towards my brother, which has hurt our relationship as well. I just never understood why I wasn't good enough... Why he didn't want me. I spent a majority of my childhood trying to make him proud, to no avail. Because of all the abuse I was a very quiet kid during school, with the mentality of don't speak unless spoken to. He was also in the military. The physical abuse didn't start right away. At first it was just spanking but the more my mom worked, the more he took advantage of the situation. Eventually, it led to punching and kicking me. He's not a small guy either, just one time to tell me he loved me. The physical abuse stopped when I got big enough to finally defend myself. When I was 17

Fast forward to how this has effected me today. Feeling empty, I love the cuddling, just the fact that they want me around and want me with them. I say ""I love you too"" knowing full well I don't. Those words are empty to me. Eventually I get bored with it and start to subconsciously sabotage it till i'm completely alone. I then get depress again and the vicious cycle  begins to repeat itself. I don't know how to stop it and all I want is to be loved, yet I don't open myself up and am pretty emotionally dead because of my childhood.

My brother is 3 years older than me and was always popular in school whereas I was a *nerd*
We would play 'pretend Street Fighter' with our hands as characters or talk late into the night about whatever it is 10 and 13 year olds talk about. I would think it was **SO** cool to have our own little secret time together. I should also add that whatever he asked me for throughout the day *he got*, it didn't take long for him to get me to do it.. after all he was my cool older brother and *what young sibling doesn't adore their elder at that age*?

---
When I was in 5th grade I developed **very early**. I was a **B cup** by the time I graduated elementary school and it wasn't long after that my brother would wake me up in the middle of the night to hang out.... *for new reasons*. To preface this I should mention that I was definitely hormonal too

---
One night he woke me up and told me he really needed a favor from me. He showed me his hard-on and told me I had to help him get rid of it. Although I didn't get 'the talk' until I was 13
He had me sit on his lap and grind his crotch as he played with my breasts and soon had me on my knees in the dark room. I can still remember what I *saw* in the moonlight, only had me give him blow-jobs and play with my breasts. 

---
This nightly ritual lasted a year or so. **At age 14 he lost his virginity to a 23 year old woman.** Back *then* of course we thought this was *super cool*,. *gross right?* We were brother and sister. 
In turn when **I** would sleep over *her* house

---
Nothing happened again until I was about 17 and he was 20. Him and his girlfriend had broken up and he was upset.... he came into my room and after crying on my shoulder started playing with my boobs which were now well into a **DD**. The next night he asked me if I wanted to go into our backyard pool in the middle of the night (it was summer) and I thought *AWESOME! Midnight dip!*. We went into the pool and he dared me to take my clothes off after which he had me stand in front of him and I felt his hard on go between my thighs: he never penetrated my vagina
That was the last time. That girl and him got back together and now he is married to her and they have two beautiful children and I live with my amazing boyfriend whom I hope to marry. I guess I should mention that I'm now in my mid-20's.

I suffered manic depression (or it was called manic depression back when they were diagnosing me, I didn't mention this but we have a little sister who is 8 years younger than me who basically knows everything there is to know about me, my boyfriend and I have the most open and trusting relationship ever....... and I have never..... EVER and WILL never tell **anyone** about this **for as long as I live**. How could YOU ever tell your significant other that the first time you gave oral was to your SIBLING at the tender age of **10**?

I wonder if my brother remembers or ever thinks about it.. I wonder if he ever feels *guilty*. We've never addressed it. If you're wondering if I think he would ever abuse anyone else, hormone-ridden boy** who's closest confidant happened to be a naive girl with big boobs who he had unlimited access to.

http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/fadg4/i_cant_remember_who_i_was_before_adderall/



I know you posted the thread about Adderall over a month ago


I started taking it without a prescription in order to motivate myself to work hard for the summer school classes I was taking. It was incredible. I felt as though for the first time in my life I had begun to reach my full potential. I got A's in all my classes and even had a teacher recommend I take graduate courses during the fall.


Since buying consistently from a friend is expensive, I decided to meet with a doctor for an evaluation to get a prescription. After probably one of the best bullshitting performances I'd ever put on, I was prescribed 20mgs twice a day and everything started looking up for me all at once. I was losing weight (oh yeah, probably should mention, I've struggled with various types of eating disorders for most of my life: bouts of anorexia, binge eating disorder, and bulimia), and had even improved most of my relationships with family and friends. I stayed within the recommended dose for a little while at first but I quickly built up a tolerance. I got too afraid to ask my doctor for a higher dose in fear he'd find out I wasn't really ADHD. So I took more and more and ran out early


I completely relate to what you said about not being able to get out of bed without popping a pill. If I didn't have any, so they were constantly pissed at me). Consequently, I would miss a lot of class/homework on the days I didn't have it. Shit started goin' down.


Not only did I feel like a shell of a human being, and my roommates were frustrated with my uncontrollable binging. How do you solve this problem? More Adderall is clearly the right decision! I started writing fake prescriptions in my therapist's name. I would go through a month's supply in a week, sometimes less. I didn't really care though because as far as I was concerned, I had an unlimited amount of Adderall.


As I'm sure you're aware, I also didn't sleep much, and if I did, it was for 14-20 hours straight. The longest I ever went without sleep was a full 3 days, but I frequently went two nights in a row (at least once a week). Hallucinations are not as cool when they're not on purpose. 

While in the intense state of paranoia I was beginning to know too well, worthy of years in jail and massive fines. FOR ONE PRESCRIPTION. I wrote approximately 30-40.  The sleep deprivation, hunger and intense paranoia hit me all at once and it was in this moment I realized how dependent I was on this drug.  Getting Adderall felt almost like a survival technique. I didn't even stop to think, ""hmm? maybe illegally obtaining a controlled substance by forged documentation isn't such a smart idea after all!""  I was so desperate I didn't even think  my actions through, and was willing to risk my freedom for a quick fix.

 
This is already getting pretty lengthy so I'll cut to the chase. I was taking 100-200mgs a day, adderall addiction sites, chat rooms, anything that showed even the slightest bit of hope for understanding what I felt. Doctor's know pretty much nothing about Adderall addiction and will probably advise you to commit yourself to an inpatient treatment center (which you probably don't need, but I'm not completely knocking it. my doctor suggested this for me dozens of times). Your friends CERTAINLY don't know anything and I'm sure if you've opened up to at least one of them, you've received the same ignorant response I did: ""Why don't you just like, stop taking them?""


This suggestion infuriated me, uncontrollable binging, extreme fatigue, not being able to think clearly, depression, extreme irritability, poor grade performance, that I would stay on it forever.


My addiction to Adderall was a tumultuous, but you are physically and mentally dependent on this drug. You admitted it and went somewhere for help, and that's the first step!


Now I'm going to be honest with you. Recovery's gonna suck. Really suck. You will gain weight. You will probably need AT LEAST 2-3 weeks of being able to do nothing but sleep, because you did it completely on your own. Stimulants are one of the hardest drugs to quit (second to heroin I'm pretty sure) because they are almost entirely a mental addiction. You will feel tired and hungry, but that's about the extent of the physical effects.


You will gain control over your thoughts, and will be able to accomplish things through your own motivation. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat it and say it's not a daily struggle, not the Adderall addiction. You will probably gain some weight, but no where near the amount I did in the time I did. Your body will go back to your natural, healthy weight once you get regular sleeping and eating patterns under control. I still experience brain fuzz, and I can still sleep most of the day away. Being in college surrounded by people using, abusing, and selling Adderall makes temptation a constant struggle as well.  Admittedly, you will NEVER go back to living that way again. I have an incredibly addictive personality and knew I was spinning out of control into addiction

She was 42 years old, naive and still a bit socially awkward at that age.

After working there a year and a half

Based on what I was being told, I was probably the only person who ever liked her.

I basically distanced myself from her for the last six months, etc... but the only times we ever spoke was when she came to me, or if we just happened to be working on something in the same team.  I never walked over to her desk again just to chat, the way I used to.

A couple months after leaving the company

I was hesitant to reply because I basically had ripped her apart after I was let go, manipulator, nutjob, etc...

Well, I offered some advice and some words of encourage, and tried to put her mind at ease.

She thanked me and told me I was a great guy.  Then she asked if I wanted to come by for a few beers.

I told her I was busy and that maybe another time would work

She texted me a couple more times over the next 20 minutes

That was the very first time the idea ever occurred to me that I could possibly get her in the sack.  I acted reluctant in my reply but said I would be over in a half hour.

Again, and I cracked a few jokes here and there and we got to laughing.  I still thought this lady was a piece of shit and to this day I still do.

I was planning on just coming out and saying, despite the fact I was still an awkward kid at that age.  But what I had going for me was I knew everyone thought she was a liar anyways.  I was convinced that she could say anything and nobody would believe it.

Well

As we ran out of things to talk about, but I thought given the circumstances that she might say yes.  After all, she's obviously a lonely woman in her 40s and I'm young and in good shape.  I wasn't concerned about what she might tell people because there was just no way in Hell that anyone would believe it, especially considering how I had spent the last two years as the strange/awkward guy in that department.

She was holding a beer and smiling

I don't even want to analyze how well things went after that.  Beats me.  All I can say is there was some kissing

I enjoyed myself and I think she did

The kicker is that at the end I pulled out and shot a load in her face as she was saying

That little move on my part didn't spoil the evening.  But a few days later my friend called me on her lunch break and said

I'm like

I love this sub, shames and embarrassments, without fear of repercussion. Or so I thought. Some of the stuff that people confess to on here can be pretty fucking heavy. And pretty fucking awful. That's the nature of this sub. No one here is asking for forgiveness, or to be told what they do is okay, they are here to clear their conscience. It's all said very well in the sidebar - ""Confession is not supposed to be easy. But it is supposed to make you feel better."" 

People are here, some of these confessions deal with some really touchy subject manner. And I think it's safe to say that *some* of the posters here could be vulnerable, riddled with guilt and with already low levels of self esteem. The last thing they need is more people telling them what they already know - that they are a bad person, *even if it sounds like they really are*. 

We are here if for nothing else but to sit, at all. We should be trying to foster an environment that is not hostile or threatening. That said, this is still one of the safer places on Reddit, but I still see trolls and people just being outright pricks to people in almost every confession, and some of these comments stay up for hours, or are never removed. We need to do our job to maintain the quality of this sub by *always* reporting any such responses, along with messaging the moderators. And I feel it is appropriate that any personal attacks or unnecessary harassment should be deleted with no exceptions and repeat offenders banned. Obviously there's a difference between genuine, but even your constructive criticism isn't something you should expect the poster to take on board or even look at.

It was located next to the bathrooms. I spent a couple of minutes there and from my peripheral vision I saw a glimpse of man standing behind the bathroom door. I thought nothing of it. Until I looked closer and notice that the man behind the door had his hand in his pants and was staring at me. My mom came to check up on me and I told her about the man in the restroom but as soon as she turned around he closed the door and my mom left. I was starting to get creeped out but continued to play games. Then the door opened up again. He continued doing what he was doing but this time he had took his penis out. This time I decided to leave and went outside. There was a bench outside located in front of the laundromat. Behind the bench were these large windows and you could see the seats inside the laundromat. The man that was in the restroom saw me leave and sat in the seats inside the laundromat. He had a newspaper in his hand and put it on his lap. I was thought he was going to read it but he then proceeded to take out his penis again and start to masturbate. I turned around because I did not want to watch what he was doing. Then I heard a tapping on the window and turned to see him trying to call my attention. I was very scared and decided to move somewhere else. I then saw him get up and I was terrified at this moment. He got in his car and continued to masturbate. He then tried to call me over and I don't know why but I decided to go up to him. He told me to get in his car but I knew better and was starting to walk away when he said it in a more forceful tone. I was just standing there scared not knowing what to do. My mom then came out to look for me and told me not to talk to strangers. When the man saw my mom he left immediately. My mom did not notice what was going on and just told me not to play on the parking lot.

Well, well a bit of a naive fool for not noping the fuck out on the first time.

I had a girlfriend for about four years, passionate, wild, uninhibited, free. It was wonderful, she was smart, engaging, liked good music and as the summer ground on we found that both of us had huge flaws but we loved one another so we we're able to work through and start to grow together. It was good, she went through a couple low end jobs with my support and finally she bought a car and was able to start to go back into her professional life. It was tough sure

It was summer now, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. Our relationship began to suffer, she started hitting the bars at night, driving home 12-15 miles at 3 am, red-eyed, sometimes horny, usually drunk. It was tough, hot late drunk night the next. We fucked a lot, wrong time

Trouble is she's still pounding the bottle, numbers, jobs, living situations, and a ton of ""look, I love you I'm here for you"", naturally we talked about the alternative, it is not my body it's not my decision, we're giving it a shot. Well after about three weeks we've gone through the preliminaries, back to the bars

The friends. Her crowd was always different from mine, lots of kids that didn't quite fit when younger. It was a pretty mixed bag, a couple were in and out of psychiatric wards, some were daddy's girls, others (well the smart ones) moved off for a few years, some didn't come back. She (the ex) had a pretty on off relationship with a friend, they we're the kind that crossed paths every couple months, they were a force of nature, she was a sexual animal, not much of a network though.

Her friend lived with a roommate, I didn't like him though, he was distant, didn't give the vibe of feeling much of the presence, an underlying touch of hostility, the kind of simian animal urge gave those flags that this dude, watch him

Well, her ability to set the world on her own terms, to come and go as she pleased, I think underneath everything she feared commitment, she feared that a kid would be one of those transformative catalysts that would break her from her former self, box her constrain her. She rebelled and howled against an unfair world, against the social pretension of a relationship saved? contrived? by a pregnancy and proposal. She started hanging out with her friend, at first I was indifferent coldly the reality set in that what life, spinning ever so slowly and there was nothing I could do. Conversations devolved into pop-psychology


Finally one night
One night

.two nights

.three nights

She was at her parents’ house, her car was there every morning. she kept in touch, texting every day, we spoke, things were distant, difficult, but the love was there in the background whispering to both of us ""just keep at it"" I receive a call, she's coming home, she's coming back down. The termination date is looming, we're doing well."" Nothing. no answer.

The Night before zero hour, I'm up all night. Bottle of scotch in my hand. I'm petrified, we're back to square one, the rocks are looming, the storms started up again. The kind of sleepless anxiety, with tired red eyes, waiting to see the light in the driveway, one of those hot muggy Virginia sunrises. The lurid reds, seeped in over the horizon mixed together through the humidity and spilled honey over the yard, asks me to breakfast.

We meet, her eyes sunk, full of tears and anger, she smells like sex, cigarettes, semen, and she's straight out. ""I cheated on you last night, and I wanted him to do it"". I fumbled “why? “, I want to be free"". I knew who it was; it was the friend’s roommate the washed out emo fucker. Four hours later I sat in the clinic on a bench, she asked the attendees not to allow anyone in. I wanted to hold her hand

 I loved that girl more than anything, she cheated again.. That however, is another story.

On the other hand I realize that my hatred is irrational and unfounded. I really don't know where this came from, ""look how casual and easy-going I am man!"" It seems like they used to be considered feminine shoes. I distinctly remember, it's some sort of inverted display of manliness that now (in the case of flip flops) lost its original meaning.

Related to this, usually that people's feet get hot, they're comfortable, or they're quicker to put on. I can't comment on the first, but the latter two are ridiculous. If you wear flip flops constantly, say hello to disgustingly dirty feet, calluses, do people know how to tie shoes? It takes me literally about 5 seconds to put on my shoes. Even if it did take slightly less time to put on flip flops

The worst is being slowed down by people because of their devotion to these atrocities, yes, flip flops (I mean, not all the way to the top obviously, I mean walking up the trails). I remember going to a friend's birthday party in high school. A few of the guys there insisted on wearing these moronic things when we were trying to play hide and seek or something (I don't remember what exactly, I just remember it involved running and they did nothing but cause trouble). I've seen chemistry labs delayed in school because some imbeciles just had to wear them (despite being told not to) and didn't have any pair or real shoes on hand. The most egregious example I can think of happened last week. I had to go down to the courthouse, and I saw a man, but with flip flops. I can't even fathom how he thought that made any sense.

I have pretty severe OCD (gee, and take medication for it. I've tried talking to therapists about this, but really nothing seems to work.

In 2003 I met my wife. At the time her mother was living with her. When things started getting serious with my wife her mother started making snide remarks to my wife about what a loser I was (to be fair, which at the time my wife was making like $45k/yr so I'm not real sure how she figured that one. 

Basically Mary (my wife's mom) was mad that she wasn't going to be able to just sponge off of my wife anymore. 

In December of that year I asked my wife to marry me, as does Mary, but I've never smoked inside as it makes your house smell like a fucking ash tray). Mary gets it in her head that *I* am the reason that she can't smoke inside anymore (this is the only person I've ever known who would smoke while actually taking a shower, I shit you not). She starts a big fight with my wife and decides to move out, also telling my wife that she won't be coming to our wedding. Hey whatever. 

So she moves in with her meth addict son (nice enough guy

Time goes on

So about three years later after Mary and her son moving around again and again (landlords don't like druggies)

I'm making about $70k/yr

One night Mary calls my wife and is crying and hysterical because her son hit her (little did I know at the time she probably *really* fucking deserved it). So my wife wants to know if Mary can stay with us for 2-3 weeks until she gets an apartment. I figured I'd take the high road and I agree. 

That was five years ago, she's in poor health, blah blah blah. 

This woman is the most ungrateful cunt I've ever met

She has diabetes and major heart problems (probably because the only foods she eats are junk and fried shit, and does fuck all but smoke and watch TV all day). It's not unusual to hear her say things like ""oh my blood sugar gets in the 400's all the time.""

If you don't know any diabetics you might not realize just how bad that is. Anything over 100 is not good. The 300 range is ketoacidosis territory. Frequent 400's is like 'lower extremity amputation is likely' territory. 

She recently had three stints put in because ***all*** of the major arteries in her body are 70% blockage or more. She had a massive heart attack on the table while having the stints put in.

I just want her to die already. I know it makes me a bad person

She is destroying her body

I've tried to talk to my wife about Mary leaving

My wife's dad died when she was young

There is SO MUCH bullshit that goes on with her

So basically it comes down to I get divorced, and it'll turn into ""you took away the last (days, weeks, months, whatever) that I had with my mommy"", and my wife will grow to resent me for it, and I don't want that. 

So basically I am left pleading with the universe to just kill this bitch already so I can get on with my life.

There is the version of a person I have created to be at my job.

There is the version of the person I've made for my wife.

There is a version for my family, etc...

But when I am alone I am nothing but a blank slate...it's hard to describe.

My greatest fear is overlap between my separate personas I have created and avoid it at all costs.

At some point in my early teens my actual personality died and I started making different personas.

I can relate to a quote from American Psycho (that bodes well...):

* “…there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there. It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration.""*

We then moved on to the bed and started making out. since i didn't have a condom we didn't have sex but she felt bad about getting me hard so she offered to go down on me i didn't stop her. it was the best blowjob i had ever had she made me cum in her mouth then swallowed most of it. after i got cleaned up i asked if she wanted me to come back the next night with condoms. she said no that she was married and that i was bigger than her husband and she felt like that would damage their relationship to much. she then put her wedding ring back on and said she needed to go to sleep so i should leave. i feel terrible about it i needed to let it out,t5_2qo2a,True

I met up with my friend, deep down, I just want an emotional connection with sex.

The conversation turned extremely sexual while we were drinking. Sharing dirty stories etc. I joked to my female friend that tequila made me horny and that we should go to the bathroom and hook up. We have strong banter and she smiled and called me a dickhead. We hit up a club. While we were standing in line ordering a drink

We hit the dance floor and start dancing close. I feel her body. She keeps on dancing into me. I grab her ass. She grins and dances into me. She keeps leaning into me as if to tease me for a kiss. I start dancing towards her and ushering us towards the toilets, and i backed off. She comes back and keeps dancing on me, and I get a little more aggressive with the groping. I'm horny, and at this stage i'm hard. The dance floor is packed. 

I lean in and say ""you need a fuck tonight"" and she says

We keep in dancing. I'm not in love with her and I've never considered hooking up with her. I'm hard. Every time I back off she dances back, with erection. She raises her hands in surprise and steps back. I don't approach her. She comes back and starts dancing with me, more friends-like. 

We dance for a little longer and it's clear that she's reached her comfort limit. She says I should go home. I do. It never seems like she's angry or hurt

The next day, but normal messages. 

Day after she explodes at me over text. Saying that I molested her, then said that I didn't understand the difference between friends flirting and dancing and whatever i was ""trying to do""

I've apologised profusely, and told her that I hoped we could work through it.

Did I sexually assault a girl? Is what went through my mind as ""oh this could be fun"" a horrible

It wasn't the right fit for me from the start. I ended up settling for a school I didn't really want. It didn't matter

Unfortunately once I got there, I've got to have some nazi in me.

I couldn't believe the cliqueyness and segregation of this campus. It made prison look like a hippie commune. The aryan nation would look downright tolerant and welcoming. People only hung out with those like themselves. I took a sports psychology class and I was the only non-varsity athlete. At the end of it some charmer from the lacrosse team (of course) come out of the blue tell me that he would hook up with me but I wasn't an athlete so ""it would be weird"". You know the undercurrent of cliquey-ness is strong if it actively limits the sex live of lacrosse players. On a more serious note

I tried joining clubs but that was futile. Too many type A students taking themselves too seriously. I considered joining a sorority but at my school, it meant I needed to work 100 times as hard as some frat boy with an advanced copy of the test.

Eventually I realized I was in some kind of existential prison camp and treated it as such. I kept my head down, attractive young woman would end up so isolated and alone around people her age.

That was until I showed up to the emergency roomed with severe abdominal pain and GI bleeding. The doctors diagnosed me with Crohn's disease. If you don't know what that is

But I get depressed thinking about those years I won't get back. Those were supposed to be the best years of my life and I spent them miserable and it was 100% my fault. No one should do that to themselves and I should have left sooner. I pretend those years didn't happen. I cut them out of my life. I tell people I spent some time in Poland instead of telling them the truth. I've started shaving a little off my age in an attempt to recapture some lost youth. I've been thinking of changing my name to distance myself from that place. I can't explain what was so horrible about it. It felt like the problems I had were the result of some kind of serve personal failure. I gained nothing from that experience but I won't let it drag me down. I don't know if I am ready to speak honestly about the experience.

When I was a kid, only to leave in the morning before we got up. The only day she didn't work, Sunday, we would all go to the grocery store. She would make it a game for us to pick the least expensive things we could find, which was a fun game when I was young and didn't realize why it was so necessary. We would show her all we found, she'd choose what she wanted out of it, and then we would buy it with food stamps. 

Food stamps didn't mean anything to me until I turned twelve and went on to jr. high. I was bullied because my shoes had holes and I would wear the same stupid thrift store clothes all the time and my sister would cut my hair herself so my bangs were always jagged and uneven. 

I was ashamed of my family and our poverty. I wouldn't let anybody's parents drive me all the way up to my apartment; I would tell them to drop me off on the corner and I would walk the rest of the way so they wouldn't see how we lived. Yet it seemed I was the only one who couldn't appreciate what we had. My family loved each other in a way that I don't think every child gets to experience. I didn't see that. All i saw was the stained walls and too-small clothes and the horrible smell. And the food stamps.

My father came back into the picture when I was fifteen. My mother lost custodial rights of me (my brothers and sister were all eighteen and over at this point) and I moved to L.A. to live with my dad. 
On the last day with my mother as I was packing up my stuff, begging me to stay, trying to convince them that I needed her. After being refused a thousand times, she ran into her bedroom and came back with an envelope for me. She handed it to one of the agents, saying it was for me, and I turned around, completely expressionless, I won't need food stamps."" 
The heartbroken look on her face after I said that will always be in my head. It is the manifestation of all my guilt and all I made her suffer. 

After I moved in with my dad i adapted to a cushy and extravagant lifestyle. He was never home but he let me buy whatever I wanted. I got into a prestigious college on the east coast and that's where I am now

Today I was at the grocery store with two of my friends picking up some things for a party I'm throwing tomorrow night. About two people in front of us in the checkout was a young mother who was taking forever to pay. She had a young daughter who looked about four or five at her side as she pulled out a mountain of crumpled coupons and food stamps. The man in front of us, saying some of us had things to do, places to go, etc. I watched this poor young mother get badgered by wealthy people who had no idea what she had to go through every day, and I didn't do anything.

I knew exactly what she had to go through every day. Yet I didn't say anything. i just stared down at my beautiful shoes
When she finally finished she apologized profusely, and all of a sudden the life I had tried so diligently to forget was happening before my eyes. Yet I did nothing.

I began dating a boy who I liked at school

A few years into our relationship I had asked him if he had ever been with another little girl before. He claimed then (and still to this day) that he had not, I became a bit more concerned. Growing up I just accepted our situation for what it was - that we were in a secret relationship and in mutual love. 

Obviously I became more aware that I had been victimized, that he is still attracted to other children, that he might be doing things with other children even now, etc...

About three weeks ago he approached me with an absolutely awful confession. That he was very much attracted to our mutual 6 year old cousin (related to me by blood, emphasizing that she was a child and it would be damaging and *rape* and not to mention illegal ... all the while not really realizing, in the moment, that I was describing our relationship as well.

He did not take it well. He promised not to do anything with our cousin, and that the only reason I reacted the way that I did to his suggestion was because I wanted out of the relationship. 

I'm not sure how I feel or where I stand right now. I do not want any other children to be harmed by him, even though I know that is the right thing to want. 

I loved him very much for a very long time

I'm sorry if this is hard to follow. I've never shared any of this with anyone before

Some things I imagine people might be wondering off the bat: No, but they do not know the nature of our relationship. They didn't consider it abnormal that I would want to live with him, since we have always been ""close"" from their perspective, and we have always been regarded as family even though we're not related, etc.
