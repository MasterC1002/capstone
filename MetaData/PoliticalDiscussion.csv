Total lie. They are laying off 50 people, 2011. So they announced the company will be closed by 2015 in 2011:

 **Research in Motion Ltd - 3


These layoffs were announced in June of 2012. Not because of the economy but because they create a product that has lost demand since other competitors have sold more goods:
http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2012/11/08/research-in-motion-cuts-jobs-at-irving-headquarters/

**Lightyear Network Solutions - 15**


These aren't layoffs...they are permanent in an effort to downsize a company that has been losing money for a long time.

 **Hawker Beechcraft - 410**

This company declared bankruptcy last year and sold to a chinese company in July of 2011. This recent round of layoffs was 170 people and their business has been in decline since 2008. They make luxury private jets for rich people and I'm assuming the rich can only own a certain amount of private luxury jets at one time:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120802/us-hawker-beechcraft-layoffs/


 **Boeing 61

Boeing expanded it's business dramatically during the Iraq war with HUGE contracts with the defense department. As the war came to a close, across-the-board U.S. budget cuts due to take effect on January 2, or the outcome of U.S. elections, but represented another step in its continuing drive to ""be more competitive while investing in technologies and people.""
So the company itself is deying it has anything to do with the presidential elections and that they layoffs were planned and expected:

 **CVPH Medical Center - 17**

This hospital received $3.2 million dollars in federal grant money to keep their doors open but their expenses exceeded their revenues by more than $400
http://www.cvph.org/news-and-events/news-detail.aspx?newsid=45

 **US Cellular - 980**

This was the result of a sale of a company to a competitor. Sprint (cell phone company) purchased US Cellular to eliminate a competitor in a certain market. This was a planned sale that took place over the past month
http://www.wirelessweek.com/News/2012/11/carriers-Sprint-Buys-US-Cellular-Midwest-Markets-for-480M/

 **Commerzbank - 6

This is the funniest one so far. This is a bank from Germany and Poland that has absolutely no connection to the U.S. or Obama In looking for official layoff reports
https://www.commerzbank.com/en/hauptnavigation/presse/pressemitteilungen/archiv1/2012/quartal_12_04/presse_archiv_detail_12_04_9794.html

 **Iberia - 7

This is the second funniest because it's an airline out of SPAIN that has no connections (or jobs) to the U.S. Spain's economy has been sinking harder that the U.S. since 2007. Absolutely no connection to America or Obama:
http://www.theworld.org/2012/11/spains-iberia-airlines-announces-layoffs/

 **Momentive Performance Materials - 150**

This is a TEMPORARY LAYOFF. All of these jobs will be reinstated in two weeks

I'm not even looking this up. If people are stupid and desperate enough to blame Obama for the layoff of 20 people in Berlin, I wonder if they even realize that Berlin is in Germany and not in America. Probably not.

 **Vestas Wind Systems 1

Huge lie. First sentence in this story reports the layoffs to be 200 and not 1, have reduced Vestas' Colorado workforce from 1,700 to 1,200 this year.* So we can assume the total number of employees is 1,700 (the amount the email suggests was laid off) and that the numbers laid off amount to 500.

 **Husqvarna - 390**

This is a company based in Sweden
http://www.appliancemagazine.com/news.php?article=1626614&amp;zone=0&amp;first=1

This is another funny one. Ericsson is a Swedish company (like Husqvarna) and those layoffs are in Sweden. They are not 14,550. Pretty big difference:

 **PerkinElmer - 75**

This company is moving operations overseas to save money on having to pay Americans a livable wage. The governor of MA tried to talk them into keeping the jobs in America but the company refused to discuss it with them before making the decision to outsource their jobs:

 **Majestic Star Casino and Hotel - 80**

THIS is a company trying to destroy their union. Their workers are in a union and their contract ran out Oct. 31st. The company has made more money this year than they did last year but they are still cutting jobs despite making more money. A quote from the union representative: “These out-of-state owners who control billions are coming to Indiana and taking away our jobs

 **Hill Rom - 200**

This is ANOTHER company where the right wing blogs continue to report a layoff in these numbers (200) where there is absolutely no real news source or citation for this. Repeating something over and over doesn't make it true. Just look at Fox: They said Romney would be elected for the past month 1

 **Darden Restaurants - 3%**

This is the company that owns Red Lobster and the Olive Garden. All they are doing is cutting back hours so they aren't forced to cover employees' medical insurance. Typical big business: Just like Walmart: Wring your workers out for all you can get

 **JANCOA - 350**

Practically every post on Reddit I see from a Republican says something like ""I wish the Republicans would focus more on fiscal responsibility and free trade, guns, and gays.""  Well guess what?  The Libertarian party is all about that.

I'm pretty sure Obama has this election in the bag and always has.  But even if you think it's still close, do I really want Mitt Romney as President?  He has said nothing specific and has only thrown out soundbites on both sides of every issue, just saying whatever he can to give Fox news a good show and keep people angry enough to vote for him.

I'm not saying I expect or even really want a true Libertarian President any time soon.  And I'm not affiliated with Johnson at all.  But a message needs to be sent to the Republican Party.  Get back to conservative economic policy.  Stop focusing so much on stoking people's hatred.  Give us real thinkers and leaders as candidates.  Stop letting Fox news bully you into doing whatever gives them ratings

It was just a few years ago that Republicans had control of government in this country like never before.  President, and so on.  I was so hopeful that it would usher in a new era of rational, conservative government.  And what was the first thing they did?  Made a national spectacle out of the issue of euthanasia.  And it's been downhill from there.  They are out of control now, losing seats and favor as they veer off into more and more crazy outlandish tactics and sink lower and lower into what they'll abuse and exploit just to get people to vote angry.

If Gary Johnson got a small but significant percentage of votes, especially the Republicans, that people are fed up with the Republicans promising financial freedom but only delivering blue laws, while the Demcrats promise civil freedoms but only deliver on redistribution.  It would force them to to actually deliver on the issues that most conservatives, moderates, and Republicans actually want to see from their government.  Make the Republican Party want to earn your vote back, and show them how they can do it.

So tomorrow

EDIT:  Fox News is already reporting that Romney lost because he wasn't conservative enough.  This is crazy.  It's going to keep getting worse.  The Republican party is going to keep getting crazier, and send a message that we want moderate conservatism without the social agenda, not crazy rape theories and gay-bashing.  Vote Libertarian.

&gt;I mean for instance, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.

**-Mitt Romney**


&gt;Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy. And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, move beyond a petroleum- based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.

**-Mitt Romney**

&gt; My administration will foster democracy and level barriers to trade. If elected, the anchor states of Mercosur. We will also work toward free trade with the smaller nations of Central America and the Caribbean.

**-George W. Bush, 2000**


&gt;Number three, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.

**-Mitt Romney**


&gt;We must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need to do is impose spending discipline. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009--and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks

1347540693.0,ztiew,Reviewing all of the current reported facts around the YouTube trailer that incited the Libyan embassy incident. Something seems to be very suspicious here.,gonzoblair,282,48,150,"I've been reading every article I can find about this incident and trying to piece together the facts. Based on what I've been reading

Here are the key reported facts about the film itself:

* The cast and crew stated that a man going by the alias ""Bacile"" and claiming to be an Israeli Jew told them they were making a historical drama. The director is at the time claimed in [the Craiglist casting post](http://www.mooncasting.com/us/casting-feature-desert-warrior-los-angeles/) to be someone named ""Alan Roberts.""


* The crew and cast stated [the involvement of several middle eastern men in the initial production:](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1255908--does-sam-bacile-really-exist-innocence-of-muslims-director-could-be-coptic-christian-with-a-checkered-past)
&gt;Klein said he didn’t know the real name of the man he called “Sam, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, and a couple of Coptic Christians from Egypt — worked on the film, Klein said.


* Despite their involvement


* The actors are given alternate fake scripts that feature scenes that would visually match the inflammatory sequences but carefully packaged to completely conceal the film's content. Every effort is made by the 'producers' to hide, [the scenes are manipulated and re-dubbed to recast it into a blatant anti-Islamic caricature mocking the prophet Mohammed](http://gawker.com/5942748). 


* These scenes are cobbled together into a 14 minute YouTube video
&gt;He said the film had been shown at a screening at a theater “100 yards or so” from Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood over the summer


* When news begins to break and reporters attempt to contact someone named ""Bacile


* The man impersonating Bacile is revealed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula


* When confronted by an AP reporter he continues to claim that Bacile is a real person who is a Jewish Israeli and further claims that he himself is a Coptic Christian.
&gt;""Nakoula denied he had posed as Bacile. During a conversation outside his home


* Two key players in this drama, and were told to promote the video at a certain time. [They also appear to have been misled about the identity of the real creators:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/)
&gt;Klein told me that Bacile, and most likely not Jewish, as has been reported, and that the name is, in fact, a pseudonym. He said he did not know “Bacile”‘s real name. He said the man who identified himself as Bacile asked him to help make the anti-Muhammad film. When I asked him to describe Bacile, he said: “**I don’t know that much about him. I met him, no. I can tell you this for sure


* Both men are asked to promote the YouTube video around the date of the attacks, publicly known for inciting violence is brought in at this point:](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h0mrl3Q2GBDz-IB8AR9YyByWKqPw?docId=80b06a6ab90443feb4d91aefb6674cc6)
&gt;Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, said he spoke with the movie's director on the phone Wednesday and prayed for him. He said he has not met the filmmaker in person, but the man contacted him a few weeks ago about promoting the movie. ""I have not met him. Sam Bacile, that is not his real name,"" Jones said. ""I just talked to him on the phone.


* Reports from eyewitnesses and officials come in from Libya that the deadly attack on the US embassy appears to have been pre-planned. It's said that the attackers appeared extremely professional level and that the protest outside appeared relatively peaceful and largely used as [a diversion until the actual attack began.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-us-ambassador-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1)

* Nakoula nows denies any involvement in the film's creation stating:
&gt;Nakoula told the Associated Press he managed a company that produced the video, I know nothing about it. They need to blame someone,” Nakoula later told the Telegraph during an interview outside his Los Angeles home. But on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials said that Nakoula was in fact Bacile. 

* In July of 2011 — the month after he got out of jail — Nakoula started casting actors for “Innocence.”

* [WIRED article cites](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) several other aliases uncovered being used by Nakoula. Matthew Nekola; Ahmed Hamdy; Amal Nada; Daniel K.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 6 PM EST**

* We now know somewhat of the process on how the video was spread in the key regions. [Both the U.S. promotion by Jones at the request of Bacile and the promoting within the middle east and Egypt specifically appeared to happen at the same time.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/egyptian-outrage-peddler-who-sent-anti-islam-youtube-clip-viral/56826/)
&gt; The original trailer of Innocence of Muslims was posted to YouTube by Bacile in July, a host on the Islamist satellite-TV station al-Nas.* On Sept. 8, Abdullah lit the match that set this entire international incident in motion and broadcast an offensive clip of the trailer in which a man playing Muhammad calls a donkey ""the first Muslim animal."" 
[Here's the fateful moment of Abdullah on TV playing the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnM_NuW0r9M&amp;feature=player_embedded)


* 3 days BEFORE the embassy attack and before the Bacile/Nousak interview with AP in which he claimed to be Coptic
&gt; Shortly following Abdullah's broadcast

* Bacile/Nakoula's YouTube account appears to have favorited a video from Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar:
&gt; Sam Bacile, but he also commented in Arabic on an Egyptian video discussing his movie, and [last month he had favorited a video from the Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar attacking Ibrahim Issa and defending the Salafis](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=15). A video defending Salafism is an odd choice for someone who claims to think Islam is a cancer to add to his favorites.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 7 PM EST**

* [Nakoula himself has a more extensive criminal record than originally known:](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&amp;cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&amp;utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)

The D.A.’s office said he violated probation on April 8, 2002, and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.

So if you're on Reddit &amp; you feel the urge to post a comment about how nothing can/will change when it comes to government surveillance - ***Don't*** - and instead spend that time on an email to your elected representative about today's vote on defunding NSA programs instead.

*Analysis &amp; Discussion*:

* The crux of the issue is not being focused on. What people should be focusing on in the Christopher Dorner saga is not the how but the why. Why are so many people in support of the message that police conduct needs to change? Dorner is not some extreme outlier in our population. He is not dissimilar from many individuals who learn about him in the media. The truth is this: we live in a dysfunctional society, and attacked another. 


* The individuals who are upset about those who support the ex-officers’ actions or his words should be more upset about the fact that an environment is present that even allows so many to relate to this individual. Ultimately, however.

* The distrust and discontent of the United States government by its citizens is only growing and is seeping into public life.

Note: Apply ""allegedly"" to all of this. So if he actually did what everyone thinks he did.

Yes, including documents that had nothing related to whistle-blowing. Documents that included things like our diplomats bitching about other diplomats and world leaders, something that's not likely to help us build diplomatic ties now that they're out in the open.

More importantly, including every last person on the Earth who'd want to do harm to America.

Even if you agree with Manning releasing all that other stuff

And for everyone who says, I've got news for you, because under our laws, it *is*. Amongst the charges levied against Manning is a charge under the Espionage Act. [One part in particular](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793) is damning:

&gt;**Whoever, control over, or being entrusted with **any document**, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photographic negative, model, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation

This

But ""treason""? ""Treason"" is a strong word... What's the US Constitution have to say about that?

&gt; Treason against the United States, **giving them Aid and Comfort**. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

Ah

If he leaked these documents

For those concerned about the ""Right to a speedy trial"" thing, detailing RCM 707 and UCMJ Article 10, which deal with the right to a speedy trial and ""reasonable exclusions"". The long and short of it is, there are some cases when a court can grant extensions, *especially* when it's a trial of a military officer and *especially* especially when it's dealing with state secrets. And while there's certainly an argument to be made that the US government has abused its ability to request extensions, that's not yours, mine, or even the prosecution's decision to make - it's the court's.

Also, that's about as smart as making a joke to a TSA agent about a bomb, isn't it? [Here](http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2011/03/truth-behind-quantico-brigs-decision-to.html) is Coombs' post regarding the subject.

Now, and Coombs was right to complain, and most likely also right that this *was* mistreatment of Manning... but to call it abuse is stretching things, I think. They have an extremely high-profile prisoner. Imagine how it would look if the guy joked about hanging himself with his underwear, his guards did nothing, and then the next morning he was found dead, hanged by his underwear. Now imagine the pile of shit that the guard who didn't respond to the comment would be in. According to various posts by Coombs, they went overboard in their desire to make sure he was safe. This doesn't excuse it

Incidentally

**Guantanamo**

First off, I have news for you - it is on an island in the middle of semi-hostile waters. Everything needs to be shipped there, and because of this, *everything* is expensive there.

However

Well

Well, that's why.

When his people got to Guantanamo, according to the law. And it was around that time that Republicans started making a stink about how terrorists shouldn't be tried in courts or housed in prisons on American soil, ""not in my backyard"" bullshit... and then Democrats lost the supermajority and Republicans have been using the filibuster like a blunt weapon ever since.

In 2010, all of our military installations, all the paychecks our soldiers get. It's a bill that *has* to get passed, especially during wartime. You can see it [**here**](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ383/html/PLAW-111publ383.htm). Republicans would not let it get by Congress without section 1034, which forbids the President from using any funds to move detainees from Guantanamo. In fact, they made it a part of their party platform's 2010 Congressional campaign promise list that they wouldn't let Guantanamo detainees be moved.

Obama, hoping he could work out a deal with Congress to do something about that section... because he kinda' needed the hundreds of other pages in that bill to get passed. 2012's military budget had the same section, and he once again signed the bill, knowing we couldn't just not have a military budget.

You might argue, after all, very protective of their defense spending, and Democrats generally not so much. But Republicans would have continued to stonewall, and I'll bet you anything that the line they'd use would be ""Obama cares more about terrorists than he cares about our troops!"", and given the way the public sees things, his poll numbers would shoot down the tubes. Which, isn't horrible if it *accomplishes* something, and make Obama look like a terrorist-coddling

That's the way things will continue to be

.

**""Insurance rates are rising since Obamacare went into effect!""**

I have spent a [considerable](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx) amount of time reading through this bill, and it puts a damper on the claims that insurance premiums will rise because of the bill.

First off, and quite a bit. Something like 9%. Which seems like a lot, until you [look at the last decade](http://facts.kff.org/upload/jpg/enlarge/3%20Percentage%20Increase%20in%20Health%20Insurance%20Premiums%20Compared%20to%20Inflation1.jpg). For half of that decade, prices shot up just as much, if not more.

But that's not good news... that just means that nothing changed in 2011. But something *did* change in 2012. In 2012, it's far too early to say if this is a trend, and given that most of the big changes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act puts into place don't happen until 2014, it's hard to say just what will happen to premiums then... but for now, the rise in insurance premiums is actually *slowing*.

.

So... yeah. just wanted to put that out there.

Despite producing more than $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were slightly below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970-1997, workers' incomes declined by 50%, while poverty doubled between 1984-1991.
There was widespread repression, blocking out any third parties. Just in case, they rigged elections anyway, as [89% of Venezuelans believe.](http://i.imgur.com/CubSa3w.jpg) The LA Times' Bart Jones commented that the guy who came 4th in the 1993 election may have got the most votes. (Jones, B. Hugo!, p. 184.) Inflation reached [103%](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg) and there was considerable repression, like the infamous [Caracazo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracazo) where Jones describes “mass graves” filled with “mutilated corpses” of all ages. “Tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of the head” and Red Cross workers gunned down in the street (Jones, p.124). 




**Poverty**

This is the big one. It is often mentioned in passing in the press, a country lauded for its achievements in reducing poverty. Given Venezuela's population, that equates to around 10 million people (1/3 of the entire population) pulled out of poverty. Both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment dropped from over 11% to under 8%.
Child malnutrition has [dropped by 2/3.](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg) Fully 1.2 million children were malnourished when Chavez came to power) Venezuela's [GDP per capita](http://i.imgur.com/w6nZxIy.jpg) has skyrocketed


**Health**

Chavez has accomplished the herculean task of creating a universal healthcare system from out of the ground. Health expenditures per person [have tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/Wn2MDia.jpg) As a result, from just 1628 for the entire nation in 1998 to 19,571 in 2007. These doctors had given 225 million free consultations by 2007(Source Cannon, B. Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93). 51,000 forgotten Venezuelans were given operations to restore their sight. 

**Democracy**

Voter turnout in the 2012 elections was over [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election, nearly two and a half times as many people vote as in the 1990s. (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout [14.8mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012)) 
 Jimmy Carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, only [11% of Venezuelans claimed elections were clean.](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) By 2006, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuela has by far the largest number of political parties in Latin America, and their confidence in them is the [highest in the region](http://i.imgur.com/c7B0Me0.jpg). This is in contrast to a 1990 poll which found only 4% approval of parties. (Source: Buxton, J. Case Studies in Latin American Political Economy, p. 177) In 2002, [80% of Venezuelans believed “my vote influences policy”](http://i.imgur.com/6uRqNRB.jpg). Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy, [by far the most popular answer was 10.](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) Venezuelans believe there is [slightly more freedom of speech in VZ than in Spain.](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg)

**Women's Rights**

Venezuela was an uber- machismo society (think “Mad Men”).  The new [Constitution](http://venezuelanalysis.com/constitution) was written with gender neutral words. Housewives' work is officially recognised as work and housewives get paid by the government to work. The women's bank was set up to provide loans to women. There has been a 500% increase in the amount of female representatives in parliament. It is a loong way from a feminist's dream. But it has considerably improved.


**Economy**

Venezuela's economy has more than [tripled in size since Chavez took office.](http://imgur.com/X6DaqGO) In Foreign Affairs, Venezuelan inflation has [plummeted since Chavez took office-](http://i.imgur.com/XZKvxxP.jpg) down from 103% one year pre-Chavez to just 18.6% this year. This despite a large increase in spending power. How are they doing this? They must be racking up huge debts, right? [Wrong again.](http://i.imgur.com/dohx0dT.jpg)


**Education** 

Thanks to [Mission Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Robinson) more than 1.5 million forgotten Venezuelans have learned to read and write for the first time. ([Jones
Despite its small population, Revolutionary Doctors, p. 147](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DjjW_XAkE4AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=revolutionary+doctors&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QYs7UdKOBo7Y7AbVxYGIBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=university%20enrollment&amp;f=false)) University education is free in public universities. Nearly half a million street children are now in school and [dropout rates are very low.](http://i.imgur.com/KVJ335h.jpg)


**Equality**

According to the GINI index, inequality has [dropped from 0.49 to 0.39](http://venezuela-us.org/tablas/gini_e.html). [(Numbers confirmed by this BBC article)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19813533) to become the lowest in Latin America. 

**Integration**

Venezuela has taken the lead in integrating Latin America. Organizations like [CELAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Latin_American_and_Caribbean_States), [the most admired country in Latin America.](http://i.imgur.com/yZFMfwH.png). In 1996, it was only [the 6th](http://i.imgur.com/OH2qWcd.jpg).

Most of these [highly](https://www.google.ca/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:VEN&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gdp%20venezuela#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=eg_use_elec_kh_pc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:VEN:COL&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=889142400000&amp;tend=1267833600000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) accessible [facts](http://www.latinobarometro.org/latino/LATAnalizeSample.jsp) are [easily available online](http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/11/05/section-2-national-conditions-and-the-global-economy/)

It makes the USA seem like an elephant that's scared of a mouse, so why the hell do we still cling to this senseless embargo on Cuba while Fidel Castro happily smokes cigars into his 80s? Having outlived Reagan, JFK, Nixon and LBJ, how long are we going to wait?

EDIT: A number of people have rightly pointed out that a lesson can be made on how not to be boring, but good lessons are productive and engaging, and I know from experience that ""don't-do-this"" type lessons are just not as interesting and productive as ""do it like this"" type lessons.  We'll be talking about the debate in class for sure, but let's just say it didn't provide me with the material I'd hoped it would.

**Edit 2**: It's really funny how many people are still messaging me about how my political bias is somehow cheating my students.  You people should really learn that you can't make sweeping judgments about people based on very little knowledge.  The last Democrat whom I voted for president was Clinton.  President Clinton - not Secretary.  I am hardly a Democrat mouthpiece, I've been very critical of Obama's performance in office.  By my (too-high) standards, he has not been a good president.

I appreciate that so many of you know how to teach my class better than do I.  This is exactly what's wrong with America's educational system: all the best teachers just sit at home and complain about the paid teachers!  End sarcasm.  The point is that there is more to learn from watching a good example than a poor one.  Is there nothing to learn from this debate?

I think the biggest issue in America today is that most Americans have no idea who most of their candidates are in every election they are capable of voting in.

Thanks to the internet there are logical steps we can take to begin to resolve this problem

Step 1: voters must have the ability to learn about

Problem: today voters need to first track down their sample ballot (which does not include write-in candidates, and end up not voting, casting poorly informed votes, or blindly voting along party lines.

Do you think that when researching our candidates becomes dramatically easier

Another problem: [this graphic](http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png). *Even with* a government monitoring tool like EveryVote, that adequately monitoring our officials is completely impossible for average voters.

To anyone who wants to better understand healthcare in the US and the Affordable Care Act, and I can't believe how much I learned from watching this.

edit: People have been asking what *I* think should be done.  First, I think health insurance needs to be expanded to include everyone.  Ideally, we should implement a public option that provides modest benefits while still being a strong safety net.  It should be as affordable as possible.  People on this plan would need to pay 10% of the cost to the insurance provider, so they're not completely divorced from the cost of their health services.  A $600 ambulance ride would cost $60, for example.  Checkups and preventative care would be exempt, to encourage its use.  Certain catastrophic care could have an even lower co-pay, like maybe 1%.  Over time, as supplemental insurance.  If you or your employer want to pay more for your health insurance so that you can see doctors in more expensive practices

  Throughout high school I was heavy into politics, etc. and I was a staunch Republican. I condemned Bill Clinton, while praising G.W. with my next breath, much to the chagrin of my teacher, but it did make for lively debates. I believed in the trickle down economic theory, as much as a clueless high school kid could. I despised those who were on federal and state assistance, I looked at them as lazy leeches who just weren't trying hard enough to get farther in life. I was taught that it was their fault
  
  In college, if not entirely liberal school.  I majored in political science so I was in the war zone so to speak of the liberal educators. It felt like it was them versus me, which in reality, it was. Eventually I got tired of school around my junior year, so I did what any good little Republican would do and joined the military. Right? It would seem as though if you were a real Republican you would have joined, or at least not fled the country to avoid serving...
 
  Now, bigotry, and a general disdain for the 'other' people in our country. I went to Iraq from 2008-2009, and there was a great deal of shouting about this and that, but none of it was remotely coherent. Now I am not saying that our military is filled with a bunch of ignorant folk, it just happened to be I was stationed with the majority of them, but there were some shining examples of intelligence amongst them and I am still friends with them to this day. Now I had a fair understanding of politics and government workings, but I was at least educated in the matter. At this point in time I realized, so I wish they did. It would have made for better conversation. But instead it was just constant blathering about how Obama will ruin the country or other various Fox ""news"" talking points
  
  I was growing tired of the tirades of hate, but that of the Iraqi's. I didn't see them all as terrorists as many around me had, I saw them as hard working people trying to make a life in a war torn country. And yes, to clear up something, I was in the infantry, 11B hooah. I saw what the lack of a social safety net can do, a government that cannot take proper care of it's most vulnerable, is no government at all. This was my reawakening
  
  When I finally got back home, neither could my wife. It was a tough situation we had found ourselves in. Thankfully, I was able to rely on welfare, yep, that same welfare that the GOP are railing against today. It helped me stay afloat, helped to pay my rent, bills and put food on the table. Just enough to survive, both of us. We continued to apply to jobs every day, I don't blame the president for that. It may have been a tough economy, I think he would have been called a sorcerer or something of that sort. But apparently
  
  What Republicans seem to forget is that there are people out there who want to work, those folks who bust their asses day in and day out, sometimes with multiple jobs just trying to make ends meet, but still rely on foodstamps to help feed their families. These are the people you, the GOP are attacking, I am sorry but not all of us were born with a silver spoon in our mouths.
  
  At this point I am so disgusted with our political landscape. The need to fight for equal rights for a growing segment of our population. I thought that ended in 1965, put the ignorance behind you and do what is best for your people. I am pretty sure we, as a free democratic country, a country that I fought for, should automatically give every single citizen of this country the same rights. How is it that corporations can be considered people and have rights while homosexuals still have to fight for theirs? What the hell is your issue America? Are you so blinded by your own theological reasoning and bible thumping that you cannot see what you are doing to this great country?

1. The term ""Assault Weapons, used for intermediate ranges). Assault weapons is a political term that various people define differently. The general consensus is that an ""assault weapon"" is a rifle that has certain features like vertical grips, detachable magazines or a flash suppressor.

2. Magazines =/= clips

3. Fully automatic guns and suppressor are illegal- This is not strictly true. Fully automatic guns, etc. are not illegal, they are highly regulated and expensive. If you would like to buy a suppressor for your weapon you merely need to save up a bit of cash, contact a legal dealer, do some paperwork and pay for the tax stamp.

4. Guns must be registered, keep a record of who bought the firearm but this is not done through the government.

My two cents: Affirmative Action should be based on socio-economic status. If you come come from a wealthy family and went to a good high school, regardless of your race. If your family is poor, then you probably can't afford SAT/ACT prep courses, tutors, and the myriad of other resources available at a hefty price that allow rich students to succeed. If you come from a poor family, you may have also had to deal with a lot of other things that made focusing on schoolwork more difficult. 

The whole campaign for ""diversity"" is centered around the idea that different backgrounds and perspectives are healthy for a college environment. That's all fine and good. But I'd argue that a white kid who lives in poverty will have a more important perspective than a black kid who has rich parents and went to a private school. 

The policy I am proposing wouldn't marginalize minorities - it's true that blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be more socio-economically disadvantaged

Wouldn't a single payer system be both cheaper and in many ways a huge economic boon to every business now saddled with the high costs of offering coverage?

1350606948.0,11pyy4,A former Republican turned Obama supporter. Here is why.,wazzumuzik,220,89,202,"Edit: Added a bunch of sources. Fixed the formatting.

This was a Facebook post I made  as a follow up to an earlier thread. That thread asked my conservative leaning friends to weigh in on actions Obama could take in order to sway their vote. Here is what one of them said followed by my response:

""Obama SAYS plenty that makes you want to vote for him. The problem is that he has no real experience to help him be successful. The last four years proved that in my opinion. Actions speak louder than words, I think our country would be in a much better place today. But unfortunately 2008-2012 were a waste and I just don't think I can stomach four more years of the same. Hope is not a strategy.""

First, in that context, this is a largely facts-based response to that statement.

Obama has accomplished many significant things as president. It is a common view of conservatives that he is ""the worst president ever"" or maybe the second worst (after Carter). Here is a short list of accomplishments and who they benefitted. I have sources for all of these

1. Three new trade agreements (South Korea, about 280,000 American jobs, and $12 billion in annual trade revenue. It's the largest expansion of trade in over a decade.
2. Restructuring the federal student loan program - This has added nearly $60 billion to federal student aid
3. He effectively ended the Iraq war bringing home almost 100K US troops and ending a war that cost us $200 billion a year (by CBO estimates), and the lives of over 100,000 Iraqis.
4. Under his direction
5. Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform was passed - a significant form of market regulation.
6. Love it or hate it
7. Obama passed 5 major and 9 short-term tax cuts for small business and the middle class as a part of his economic recovery plan.

The list goes on and on. Saying he's a do-nothing president is propagandist. He has accomplished a lot as a president.

So, NDAA, and many other promised reforms. I want to know what the end-game is for the war on terror. I want to know what he's going to do about drug policy. Also, his economic policies have not had their intended impact, but let's keep in mind a couple of key points for context there:

1. On the economy / jobs front, we are recovering (as evidenced by home sales, unemployment, the stock market, and a variety of other factors).
2. The newly elected Tea Party congress decided to hold our credit rating hostage against what should have been a simple formality of raising the debt ceiling. We faced a government shutdown and the first ever down-grade of our credit because of obstructionism over a formality. This is the defining moment of my inability to side with Republican fiscal policy any longer. The newly elected congressmen held our nation hostage - it was an irresponsible and dangerous ploy.

So

However, being good at starting rich and staying rich doesn't mean that your economic policies translate to the public sector. This is evidenced by his lack of specifics on any economic planning issues, and that a significant majority of economists support Obama's plans over Romney's. 

I registered as a Democrat earlier this week for the first time in 12 years. Largely because the Republican party's ideology has shifted on social issues past the point of no return. I can no longer justify being a ""fiscal conservative civil-libertarian"" with main-stream Republicans. First, I cannot see how a financial plan with a proposed $3 trillion in cuts and a $2 trillion (debatable) increase in costs will be financed by broadening the tax base and closing loopholes. It's like the party forgot how to do arithmetic, and it casts a deep shadow on Romney's capacity to understand complex economic issues. This is precisely why a solid majority of economists support Obama's plans over Romney's (Economists traditionally lean Republican).

Further, women's rights, and environmental policy. I also support more conservative policies like limited restrictions of fire arms. However, the Republican base has shifted so that ""if it ain't Christian, it ain't moral"" - which is a ludicrous stance to take. Romney's opinions on these social issues also continue to shift as the election progresses. All politicians flip-flop, but it is frustrating to see the extent to which Romney / Ryan will spin their statements to the electorate. It seems disingenuous.

Finally, and yes, even black, was inspiring to people. For many, it still is. We're watching a major shift from the boomer generation of political leadership to a new generation. If I have to pick one ideological sentiment for Obama, it is precisely that hope is a powerful message - especially when it's delivered by someone who represent the passing of one generation's ideology on to another.

Point #4: OBL

We all know who was president when he was killed. We can go round and round all day about classified sources and how the SEALS actually shot him blah blah blah. Last time I checked the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of our armed forces. That means it was his call

Point #5: Dodd-Frank

* Wikipedia has yet another fantastic article about this (243 cited sources): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act

Note: This does not mean we're below 25 in EVERY metric. We're good at a lot of things

Point #7: Tax cuts for small business

I would just like you to know that there are conservatives who support Barack Obama, right?), I am not a liberal arts major (Accounting), and I believe in most things that come with being a conservative individual from the South.  

However, and am more than happy to have a drink or befriend anyone, despite their sexual orientation.  I have my views, they have theirs.  And yes, that means I support Chick-Fil-A.  I am against abortion, because I believe that people need to accept responsibility to the consequences of their actions, and yet I also believe that abortion is sometimes worthy to consider in special circumstances.  I am pro-military

I completely support Obamacare and the healthcare reform that comes along with it.  There are parts I disagree with, and is doing his best for this country.  He's a good president, and strives to make America better as a whole, rather than just focusing on one political party.  He risked his presidency with the assault on Bin Laden, and he knew that beforehand.  I'm not here to discuss the assault itself and the political can of worms that comes along with it, but am here to present Mr. Obama's willingness to risk his presidency to do what he thought was best.  This speaks volumes of his character.  I fully support him in this next election, and would love to have dinner or a drink with him.  He has my utmost respect.

Mittens, and is running for president simply because he can.  He thrives off of the sense of power it gives him, and uses his vast amount of wealth as a financial and life cushion.  This essentially allows him to attempt to do whatever the heck he wants to do, including running for president, and the views and thoughts that accompany that.  He wants the prestige, recognition, and power that being president would bring to him, because I believe that his heart, on the other hand

Now you know where I stand and what my views are.  I do not care for up votes or down votes (check my previous comments,000.  I would just like to get my views out to someone that might understand, and let the liberal population of Reddit know that there are conservative republicans out there that are on the same side as them.

1366745247.0,1cyeqr,Cispa response email From Congressman John J. Duncan Jr. (R),Soundmantom,133,13,95,"I emailed Congressman Duncan about his ""Yay"" vote on CISPA and why he made it. It was sent as follows.



""Thank you for contacting me regarding H.R. 624 – the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). It is always a pleasure to hear from those that I represent in Congress.

Every day U.S. businesses are targeted by thousands of  state employed hackers working for the  government s of China , and Russia. These hacks result in the loss of valuable intellectual pro perty and sensitive information—$500 billion  worth in  just  the last year. This is the largest theft in the history of the world.
 
The Chinese and Russians are literally robbing us blind

Our Nation has spies in China and these other countries, and Iranians employ to rob American owned businesses. Because this information is classified, the U.S. government cannot adequately warn private businesses how to better protect themselves.

The government currently has no methodology for sharing  such information with the private sector. You would think that we already do

CISPA would allow the U.S. government to share classified information with private American businesses
 
I voted in favor of CISPA. I  did this only after I received multiple classified briefing on all aspects of the bill.

As a former trial judge

I believe that some counterterrorism powers granted to the federal government since 9/11 have gone too far.

We have been expanding federal police powers so much in the last few years that we are losing a balance between security and liberty.
 
I am satisfied that CISPA will not expand government intrusion into the lives of Americans. I strongly oppose any bill that would allow the government to spy on U.S. citizens.

CISPA specifically prohibits the government from searching your library records, what ammunition you buy, your tax returns, your education records, and your medical records. The federal government cannot and shall not snoop into your private lives.

Furthermore

What CISPA does do is protect our businesses from continually being robbed by the Chinese. It allows private businesses to have someone on their payroll receive a security clearance

These businesses will work with the federal government on a strictly voluntary basis. Nothing in CISPA can force the private sector to participate in information sharing.

CISPA would also allow the private sector to share with the government ways that the Chinese and other hackers att ack their systems and network. Our g overnment networks are attacked every day and are increasingly becoming more vulnerable. The Chinese, nuclear power plants, water resources,  and defense systems.

I have always said that the private sector is more innovative than the federal government. I believe that advances in the private sector can help keep our Nation safe from foreign interference.
 
Cyber threats evolve at the speed of technology. It may surprise you to know that the Chinese government is already spying on American citizens by reading our emails
 
It is the duty of the United States government to protect its citizens and its territory from threats both foreign and domestic. This includes protecting U.S. digital territory. But, infrastructure, and our citizens . CISPA does not give the government the authority to monitor your networks or emails. CISPA does not give the government the authority to shut down websites. And CISPA  does not allow the government to amass data on U.S. citizens. 
 
The business community overwhelmingly supports CISPA. Because companies are being robbed blind, AT&amp;T, Verizon, IBM,  Microsoft, Intel ,  Oracle ,  Facebook also supports CISPA. You may be surprised to know that the Chinese use  Facebook to spy on U.S. citizens. 

Finally, the right to sue the government. This is a right that is currently not enjoyed under U.S. law.

I believe it is paramount that U.S. citizens have recourse  against the government if they feel they have been wronged. 

I hope this better explains my vote.""

A debate where the moderators hold people to a certain time interval and expect them to debate 'job creation' is not going to result in any fruitful discussion imo.

[Here's the ad](http://youtu.be/bZxs09eV-Vc).

Now, and it's depressing to see the Obama camp (whom, in my perspective, tends to follow at least a decently intellectual and informative approach to campaigning) jump all over it for cheap votes.

My arguments are thus:

1. Big Bird and Sesame Street are not reliant on PBS for funding.  PBS is their preferred broadcasting venue, which still has admirable ratings and has been around since 1969, would probably have little problem finding a network to pick it back up eventually.

2. Big Bird is not representative of PBS.  PBS is a large network of services that encompass a lot of things.  To focus on some particular aspect of PBS is to detract from the larger argument Mitt Romney has.

3. The specific Obama ad seems to give the impression that Mitt Romney...well...just 'has it out' for Big Bird or PBS, and while that may be Romney's fault for not expounding on his intensions and paths of reason, saying that he's misguided because he wants to 'get rid of Big Bird' is jumping to conclusions and misleading.

4.  I can not stress this enough.  **Mitt Romney or any POTUS does not have the ability to cut funding to PBS** or immediately cut funding to any government program.  That job is for Congress.  The President can make executive recommendation.  They can convene Congress under an issue

*edit* 

1.  While PBS does not directly give funding to Sesame Street, which could arguably distort the programming.

4.  It has been pointed out that the President does have the ability to directly amend budgetary items via a [line-item veto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto#United_States)

*edit2*

4.  It has been pointed out by another person that the line-item veto was actually ruled unconstitutional in 1998.  The concept of of an executive line-item veto seems to have a full and recent history.

Anyone participating in this program would be provided with resources to look for jobs and prepare for interviews

The thought behind this is that it would:

* Give unemployed people a feeling of purpose and help avoid the lethargy that can come with having nothing to do each day

* Avoid big lapses in time on a person's resume

* Provide people with experience outside of their normal area of work

* Help the community by providing valuable services at no additional cost (unemployment is already being paid out)

* Remove the stigma that unemployed people are ""lazy"" or ""don't really want a job""

* Remove abuse of the system by the small population of people that actually don't want to find a job or who work off the books while collecting unemployment

(Also check out [this panel] (http://csis.org/event/schieffer-series-discussion-data-surveillance-prism-and-nsa) on this very topic hosted by Bob Schieffer. I'll reference it implicitly and below

**1** **Stop calling this man a hero.** Seriously, according to Henry David Thoreau, is to be willing to pay the price for those crimes. Look at Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, and Ghandi. These people are heroes. They stood up to injustice peacefully and paid the price, sometimes with their lives. *That's* heroic. Turning tail to China and Russia with a backpack full of secrets to sell is a coward's tactic. It’s the difference between being a whistle blower and committing treason.

Also don't take everything Snowden says at face value. In my opinion, but call it a hunch.


**2** To think that the NSA even has the capability to read every person's emails and listen to every person's phone calls is ludicrous. Do they collect everyone's meta-data? Yes. Is it illegal? No. Should we be discussing the merits of it is legal or not? **ABSOLUTELY.**

BUT...that conversation needs to be driven by FACTS

To think that the NSA has enough analysts to actually look at the content of everyone's communications data is a fantasy. Even if they had the capacity

I do get that the court that approves this activity is secret by nature


**3** Like it or not, need to have a discussion about just how threatening terrorism really is and how much of our fear is just a hangover from 9/11. In my opinion, terrorism is still a concern that necessitates a vibrant intelligence community that can handle such elusive threats. In that sense, I am more concerned about the potential for lives to be lost rather than my meta-data being stored.


**4** Regarding Germany's complaints toward the United States about spying on the EU and Snowden saying that they are ""in bed with each other"": he's right in a sense. Obviously friendly countries share intelligence. This is nothing new. But I would also have to assume Germany's outrage over the US spying on them is an act, only interests. Every country spies on every other country, no matter what their allegiances are. Espionage isn't an act of war. It's how the game is played in this system. Even if you don't want to do that, it's irresponsible as a nation since your obligation is the safety and well-being of your people. If everyone else is doing it and you aren't, you're at a huge disadvantage. If the Germans are so upset, they should get better counter intelligence. This is obviously a very geopolitical/realpolitik take, and that philosophy has its flaws. But it's an accurate descriptor of the international system that we live in, in my opinion



Anyway this is my opinion and feel free to respectfully engage me if you agree or disagree. And even though I disagree with how the part of the argument that is most prominent on reddit is taking over the conversation

**TL;DR: Don't be lazy. Read things if you want to discuss them.**

The end result was a shift in the public concept of what could be expected of a phone call
There's plenty of debate to be had about how the government uses public data (allegedly, and how they should probably be limited to a much greater degree, but trusting in the morality of composite entities like corporations or governments is foolhardy.  

When you make a call to grandma, else it should arrive unmolested. Without encrypting email though, it's like sending a letter without an envelope. Any perceived expectation of privacy is completely lacking of anything to actually support it, and you've got the same false sense of security as being naked in the wilderness, and the same sort of outrage as though a man in a stars and stripes stovepipe was looking at you from the bushes. Frankly, I'm of the opinion that it would be more prudent to be more active in making data private than trusting the metaphorical crack addict to not grab the metaphorical unattended crack left on a park bench. Not to forgive prism, but it goes both ways.

The part that scares me a bit though

In the early 2000's, having already done the deed, it is very much in the interest of the government to make sure that everyone is of the mindset that what you put on the internet, generally, is as public as your trash. Conveniently timed decision to intervene in Syria (having used chemical warfare is not news to anyone) provides a distraction, providing ample room to limit the discussion of prism before it ends up in front of any sort of judicial body. Those members are still of the public, after all. Securing the need for a direct, or at least loudest amongst the early, that unconscious an implicit expectation of the privacy of your personal email as an analog to your postage

The fact that I tried to write this post three separate times prior on a mobile device, encryption, or prism, really does nothing to soothe my very tired mind, but this is legitimately worrisome. Public! Acknowledge the fact that you expected on some level your personal emails to be private! For my sake? I'm really more curious about what reddit might think about this as potentially an indirect tactic, but really, am I crazy for having that expectation when I'm not using a business or school email?

I would also be curious to hear the Tea Party's response to this quote. In my mind their recent actions with the debt ceiling kind of exemplify the dangers of extremism. They would probably disagree strongly with the sentiment behind this quote

1357714101.0,168j6a,Why I hate the Babyboomers: A rant.,Kingsley-Zissou,199,84,308,"I'm 100% all for eliminating social security entitlements. I put 10% of my gross income into a retirement fund, low inflation, yet couldn't plan for their fucking retirements. 


I look at what the future holds for my generation, excluding room and board, will set these individuals back somewhere in the neighborhood of $50,000-$100,000 depending on the type of institution entered. Interest rates on education loans add another $10-30k to the debt load. Meanwhile, if a graduate is fortunate enough to find immediate employment, they can expect an average starting salary of $44, or $3,265.75/month. Loan payments over 20 years on $100, most people require transportation to and from their place of employment. We are left with $1


Now, I said I put 10% of my gross monthly earnings toward retirement, but for the sake of argument let's say the individual puts 5% of $3,866/month away for retirement. That comes to $193/month, leaving the graduate with $630/ month. But what about healthcare? Because frankly, it's been made clear by the boomers that they are not interested in paying for the healthcare of entry level employees. Another $183/month can be factored into monthly expenses. The graduate is left with $447/month. Now, assuming the graduate has absolutely no interest in recreation whatsoever,820,000 on rent in 5 years which could have gone toward a mortgage.


Now, yet we came from a generation of people who could pay for their education by working at fucking dairy queen. Our minimum wage jobs worked in college went toward putting a fucking roof over our heads and food in our mouths. I'm not trying to say that everybody in my generation has had this experience, but this is the true cost of being self-made for my generation. On the other side of the coin, we will enjoy limited upward mobility at our jobs because the god-damned baby boomers didn't have the foresight to plan for retirement, and now refuse to vacate their upper echelon positions which pay more money than the entry level position. Couple that with rampant greed on part of the boomers who have no problem busting unions, raiding corporate coffers, and rigging the corporate structure to work against graduates entering the workforce. In reality, it is the boomers who have driven up the cost on the millennial generation

**Edit**
Reddit, the baby boomer generation has enjoyed the greatest leap in prosperity ever experienced by man-kind, and born from that prosperity came greed unmatched by any other group of people in human history. This is evident in Reagan era trickle down economics, and continues today with a major lack of regulatory oversight of financial institutions. I don't understand how anybody can justify such individualistic viewpoints when the topic of universal healthcare is discussed, yet turn around with hands outstretched demanding medicaid and social security payments. 

I have read many responses from members of the boomer generation who bring up the war in vietnam, ungrateful, and ignorant to the world. Although I can not form an accurate opinion as to the sacrifices a generation had to make based on the experience of living through that era, I can tell you that my generation has sacrificed life and limb in similar shit-holes for similar political motivations. The only difference being, we were members of an ALL volunteer force. I sacrificed when I trekked 100lbs worth of gear through the forsaken land of Afghanistan fighting an invisible enemy who lives in a land never conquered by an invading force. I didn't do it because it was the right thing to do, but because my country asked this of me. I lost 2 brothers to enemy fire, and another lost his leg to a booby trap. I appreciate the flags and the personal thanks

As I said at the top of my edit, many of my contemporaries share similar sentiments to myself, yet we lack unification and a voice. I will be taking time to create a vehicle which, I hope, will provide a voice for a generation which is currently standing by as our inheritance is squandered on trivial pursuits by those in power who feel entitled. Perhaps we can make a change before all hope is lost. And to the person who gifted to me reddit gold, I appreciate the sentiment. Thank you all for reading and participating in this discussion!",,,,

I hold a particularly unpopular opinion

Because the US has a volunteer military, cherish, support, or even acknowledge the legitimacy of the troops. They fight and kill people in other countries, yet because our government says it's okay, it is socially acceptable. I see them as no better than hitman, except that most people are okay with what they do.

If one studies the history of US military actions, international political control, and furthering of ideology. I am not a pacifist; I believe that violence is sometimes justified, particularly against other forms of violence. However, the American government's actions do not center around self-defense.

I'm certainly not saying that Republicans don't gerrymander, and liberals have no basis for throwing any stones in that particular glass house.

1336075789.0,t5mhu,"There is something vastly wrong with people's definitions of Fascism, Capitalism, Corporatism, and Socialism here on Reddit.",adimwit,18

To try to make things simple

* Fascist Corporatism is a rejection of Capitalism and the Free Market.
* Fascist Corporatism is a rejection of Class Struggle.
* Fascism sought to bring about unity between each of the Classes and end class struggle entirely.
* The Fascist Corporation was actually a confederation of both Unions and Companies (workers and management) who would work together under the guidance of the State to achieve production goals. (This was a common thing to do for most Countries during wartime.)

Mussolini believed that Capitalism and the Free Market would inevitably lead to State Capitalism (when Big Businesses control the State)

The reason you can't say Fascism is Socialism is because Fascism completely rejected the idea of Class Struggle. Socialism was seen as a complete failure (Mussolini and many of his fellow fascists were former Socialists). Mussolini also felt that Capital did have a place in the economy (it was a great motivator and lead to greater efficiency in both Industry and Labor).

There are two basic reasons why we see Fascism as a product of Capitalism. The most obvious was Soviet propaganda which portrayed Fascism as a more extreme form of Capitalism; and another was Mussolini's own propaganda. Before Mussolini was able to completely incorporate Corporatism into the Italian government

The end result of all of this were two forms of Fascism. The far-right, bastardized form of Fascism; and the far-left, Corporate State, anti-Capitalist form of Fascism.

The far-right Fascism was admired by politicians like Winston Churchill and industrialists like the duPonts and Pews.

The far-left Fascism was admired by people like Franklin Roosevelt and John Maynard Keynes.",,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/t5mhu/there_is_something_vastly_wrong_with_peoples/

I am a normal person. I have, I was as sceptical as anyone would be  - positing the argument that, even if Socialism might be idyllic (this point, by the way, was not conceded easily - it took a lot of debate and discussion, but I do agree with the sentiment now) it is in no way faesible.  Now, however, irrespective of how realistic a socialist society might be

Now, as a system, is inherently flawed, and is to blame for the economic inequality that the world suffers.  It is essentially the belief that as the workers generate the world's wealth, they should own the means of production.  The only way this is possible is through an overthrow of the current system, by means of a revolution, rather then to work with the system we currently have (because it is inherently flawed).  

This, I believe that in order to maintain itself effectively, capatalism seeks to create divides amongst workers.  For example, a capatalist controlled media might moan about immigrants claiming benefits from the government (with a headline like ""We're paying taxes for these louts to live a life of luxury!"") - as such, we attribute our economic woes on illegal immigrants, rather then things like war and austerity.  That's an example, but I think, capatalism is the source of every form of discrimination - gender

I don't want to get into an argument about the details of socialism, they cringe in a way I imagine I would if someone told me they were a neo nazi.  Socialism seeks to explain the world - why is it that the top 100 richest people in the world earn more then the bottom 50%? Why do we overproduce food in some countries when there are people dieing of starvation a few hours plane journey away? There seem to be too many irrationalities, too many wars, too much hate. I don't want to sound too ""60's"" - but seriously, are Socialists really that bad for wanting to change things? 

Any opinion would be greatly appreciated

TL;DR: Socialism doesn't seem so bad compared to the world we currently live in

What happened at Sandy Hook was a tragedy. 20 children were killed, legal  gun owners. Instead we should focus on promoting mental healthcare and breaking down the stigmas that prevent people from seeking treatment for themselves and their children when they need it.

A frustrating portion of the current gun control arguments blazing across the internet are blatantly fear-mongering and uniformed. Everywhere from tweets to news articles from legitimate outlets I’m seeing the buzzwords of [“violent video games”](http://spectator.org/archives/2012/12/17/god-help-us),  along with people saying highly educated things like [“look at that gun, do you think it should be outlawed?”](http://www.planetside-universe.com/showpost.php?s=af0b1bc5ec360e9007cc78b4df8d95b9&amp;p=804102&amp;postcount=184). Perhaps the greatest offender is [“High velocity rounds”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/16/school-shooter-adam-lanza_n_2312818.html). The nature of all bullets is that they travel at high velocities so they can hit something and transfer lethal force before gravity pulls them to the ground. This phase is a meaningless attempt to promote fear.  The pictures you find of rifles in these news articles are not base model weapons, [but those kitted out with tons of aftermarket add-ons that make the guns look big and “aggressive”](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/politics/121217/sandy-hook-newtown-shooting-gun-control-australia-scotland-finland-changed-gun-laws-after-shooting). People are calling to reinstate the assault weapons ban, which does little but ban “scary looking” guns. In reality, this would have not applied to the weapon used in the school shooting in Connecticut. And overall, [violent crime is at its lowest rate since 1963](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/0109/US-crime-rate-at-lowest-point-in-decades.-Why-America-is-safer-now)

I have heard a lot of calls for “increased” or “reasonable” gun control

**It’s about the Children/If one Child is killed

To address a less extreme statistic, basketball, or the much under rated, yet difficult [cheerleading](http://www.mahalo.com/lauren-chang/). Yet we allow sports in school, why? Because the advantages outweigh the risks. Just like guns. 

**I don’t know why people should own guns**:  Just small reasons, defense from excesses of government (Please see below),and the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. But let’s be more specific. Guns are force equalizers. You may have heard the quote ""God Made Man, but Samuel Colt Made Them Equal"". For much of human history, power derived directly from strength.  The man who could swing the largest or fastest sword, the man who could draw the biggest bow (and underrated feat of strength), these were the men that either had power or were used to keep the power of others. Then guns come along. Suddenly, a [wheelchair bound man](http://www.examiner.com/article/disabled-former-marine-fends-off-3-home-invaders) can fend off multiple home invaders

**People don’t need Assault Rifles/Assault Weapons:** First of all, auto) AND is shoulder-fired AND fires an intermediate round (between pistol and rifle calibers) it’s not an assault rifle. Similarly, the term “assault weapon” is a legal definition in a few states such as California and New York that covers weapons bearing a certain number of modifications, such as pistol grips, bayonet lugs, or the [ever so deadly barrel shrouds]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U32GOlL5Ro4). That said, very few Civilians in the country can access actual assault rifles, adding a little bit of “cool factor”,000 yards. I’m having trouble in finding the number of bayonet killings in the country in the last few decades

**No Military style guns:** This ties in with the above statement. The similarity of civilian small arms to military hardware is a feature of technological advancement. Once muzzle loading and then bolt action rifles were “military style”. Modern weapons are safer, and less likely to hurt a bystander with a modern weapon. Military Style weapons may be used to refer to Fully Automatic weapons, also known as machine guns, which are able to fire continuously with a single trigger pull. Any arguments calling out fully automatic weapons are a clear sign of ignorance. Civilians can’t own fully automatic weapons without a $200 permit and an extensive background check. Even then, civilians can only buy fully automatic weapons made before 1986, which means the number of weapons available is fixed and prohibitively expensive (on the order $20,000+). Even so, but account for less than 1% of confiscated gang weapons. 

**I don’t know why anybody would need semi-automatic guns:** Guns don’t make a small click like the trigger on a video game controller. You are holding a device in your hands that contains and directs a small explosion. Even firing a gun in a safe gun range with hearing protection will increase the heart rate and adrenaline output of most shooters. Now add the stress of being awoken in the night by someone breaking into your house. I hope you have nerves of steel and a steady hand, but what about revolvers? Well, I hope you are not attacked by more than 6 assailants and/or don’t miss a single time. And revolving chambers are not practical for hunting rifles. The combination of high powered rounds and unsealed chambers reduce weapon effectiveness and can lead to user injury.  This means hunters would have to use bolt-action/lever action weapons or reload after every shot. These delays in a follow up shot means injured game has a chance to escape, resulting in increased suffering of the animal as it slowly bleeds out and less food on the table for those that depend on hunting. Additionally, the detachable magazines common to semi-automatics are lauded by hunters for their convenience and safety when performing activities that are best done with an unloaded rifle, such as climbing over fences or racking your weapon in your car for transport. 

**Guns should be kept unloaded, and it is perhaps the most ridiculous. In a defense situation, you are not going to have time to run to your safe, remember the combination under stress, unlock the trigger lock on your gun, load it, and then bring it to bear on the attacker. [Trigger locks are especially useless, to prevent access by curious children or thieves looking for a gun unconnected to them. This practice is made simpler with the detachable box magazine common to semi-automatics. If the practice of single sign on verification in computer security teaches us anything

**Guns Defend Against Tyranny? Good luck shooting your pistols at Tanks and Cruise Missiles:** Anyone who talks about overthrowing the military and government by force of arms is likely not living in reality. If our society ever devolved to the point of near post-apocalyptic decay, they have still taken quite a toll with improvised explosive devices and small arms. The United States has 10 times the population of Afghanistan. Any suppression activities carried out by our military are going to be long, bloody, and costly urban warfare for the most part (even assuming 100% loyalty of the armed forces in killing our own civilians). Although, if it ever came to the point where our citizenry were embattled against our own military, the United States would be done as we know it. 

So what are reasonable gun controls to me?

**Uniform implementation of controls that are already in effect in some states:** Background checks

**Training:** I think gun owners should be required to attend an affordable

**Mental Health Screenings:** I would be open to hearing suggestions on the best way to implement mental health screenings for gun purchases. I realize that it wouldn't have helped in this case

**TL, plentiful links, and use of Bolding!**

In summary, rape, and murder well before guns were invented. Our society is becoming more peaceful, but responding to tragedy with unreasonable new laws is not the answer to maintain that safety. I welcome an informed discussion on gun control based on logic, not emotion. Let’s all please do our research, have a friendly discussion, and together figure out the best way forward.

You’re purposefully and intentionally giving the company money, a portion of which will be donated to known hate groups. Would you go out of your way to intentionally support a business that openly contributed to the KKK?

Furthermore, then, how it feels for that person to open up Facebook and see that someone they thought was a friend is out, right that minute, supporting anti-gay bigotry, and bragging about it on their newsfeed?

Today we have a number of issues, decreasing purchasing power by the average citizen, lack of accessible healthcare, massive debt, low education, high crime, losing credibility, oligopolies, usually by claiming their political ideology will fix the problem. 

However, corporate/special interests, money in politics. They've managed to rig the game as to where if you want to be elected, you NEED to accept their money. If you don't, they'll give it to the next guy who will pummel you in the elections off sheer financial might. It's become necessary to accept big money to remain competitive -- subsequently resulting in politicians acting firstly in the best will of their large donors before the people. It's not that the representatives are evil, it's just that they are forced to play a terrible game. 

The obvious results are all the above. The big money has managed to create an economy that overly regulates small business

If we sole this issue of money in politics, after a truly competitive marketplace returns, issues like low wages, not being able to afford healthcare, widening social gaps, unemployment, and so on, there would be no need to treat these symptoms.

However, as the primaries are by and large decided by big money, leaving the common person to decide between one of the two people who are essentially supporting of big money...

Is there a way out of this? I honestly believe, and would radically transform America tremendously in a positive manner if we could figure out a way to get big money and special interests in general out of politics.

There seems little way out until one side manages to permanently cripple the other, and just like in the real Civil War 150 years ago, whichever sides wins may have to end up destroying half the country in order to do so.

1374172221.0,1ikq4m,"My essay about why Rolling Stone's Tsarnaev Cover symbolizes so much about why America is fucked up. (Very long, but hopefully worth the read.)",scarlethester,144,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ikq4m/my_essay_about_why_rolling_stones_tsarnaev_cover/

Yesterday the internet pretty much exploded in rage about the Rolling Stone cover of Dzokhar Tsarnaev, CVS and another native local grocery store flat out said they won’t stock that issue of the magazine. The mayor of Boston said he was outraged. The Boston Globe said the magazine was an ""act of irresponsibility."" 

I support their choice on the cover. In fact, that wolves like Tsarnaev often wear sheep’s clothing. And that reminder, in and of itself, is immensely valuable. 

I feel this cover is deeply misunderstood. People saw Rolling Stone's cover, psychological reaction to it, which bears much closer examination.

A bomber can dress just like a rock star and blend in to the crowd and he doesn't have to look like a hideous monster, thousand yard stare; there was so clearly something deeply wrong with him. Mental illness is disturbing by nature.

But Tsarnaev? He blends in. And that’s why so many people are outraged by that cover, is deeply disturbing us, but they've chosen to do it on purpose. They are doing it because they’re showing us that anyone, from the kid next door you hire to mow your lawn, to the kid who takes your movie tickets next time you catch an afternoon showing, could be planning something nefarious.

But look at little closer. The outrage people feel from looking at that cover isn't coming from Rolling Stone. Deep down, similar to one a rock-star might choose. The words they put beside the photo are entirely appropriate. They labeled him “The Bomber.”  The outrage that so many people are feeling from viewing that cover springs from the deep discomfort they feel on looking at it because it comes along subconsciously, with a psychological disconnect. *For good reason, too: just how do you identify a psychopath when he looks just like the very attractive kid next door?*

As a species, the beautiful. Entire magazines, huge advertising budgets exist to capture, to exploit this tendency of ours. It’s a huge part of our psychological makeup. As a result, we can’t help but feel that attractive people don’t do hideous things.  Our conscious mind may tell us that Tsarnaev bombed the marathon but something in the subconscious is willing to contradict that, because of that pre-programmed bias. And that irritates us, most of us, a hack into our vanity. We don’t want to admit this fact

To look at that photo, immensely attractive teenager who allegedly, premeditatedly bombed a marathon, killing several Americans and permanently maiming and wounding scores more. Looking at that picture of Tsarnaev, is to simultaneously contemplate the bombings and to realize the baby-faced teenager on the cover was responsible, but also to have to deal with the psychological disconnect that someone so attractive would do such a horrible thing. And then, perhaps, as for me, perhaps their new lives in wheelchairs. Irreversible nerve pain. Their lives will never be the same. It’s difficult not to feel a fundamental need for retributive action. But when we look for someone to blame, the image Rolling Stone presents us is so far off the mark as to be ludicrous in its complete and utter disparity from what we feel a bomber ‘should’ look like. 

But this is exactly why a truthful picture is needed. America is at a fundamental junction in history. We’re sheering off into factions, with a rift that seems to be growing year by year. We have a failing educational system, starting with day-care, which many working parents are struggling to even afford, all the way up to college, where the tuition rates for students at even in-state colleges are sky-rocketing, and many students are graduating from 4 year institutions with such a massive debt load that it may take as many as 25 or 30 years for them to fully pay back all of their debt. Some, may never manage it. Because the debt cannot be discharged through bankruptcy, across the board, and frankly

Because we now have knee-jerk reactions, when books, magazines, and all media needed to be altered by the state to fit what the state found ""currently acceptable.""  Tsarnaev's appearance is not currently acceptable. Hence, censored.

We no longer think critically, he may resemble a rock star, but that that fact is not a reason to ban the magazine, or to ask Rolling Stone to change the cover. Such a reaction is the reaction of a repressive, close-minded state, one that does not understand critical thinking or its role in education. Flexibility, intelligence, not a knee-jerk reaction to what makes you feel scared and threatened. Because in the end

Next time we as a nation feel threatened, the expensive route. This has been our modus operandi for so long. This is our post 9/11, fear operated world.

 We need to stop installing inefficient, how best to meet them and how it can be done simply, cheaply, and without invasion of privacy of individuals. The NSA’s surveillance of every individual in the USA is an outrage that we should not be standing for, because it doesn’t actually yield effective results. If it did, wouldn’t Tsarnaev and his brother have been caught before the Boston bombings actually happened? He wasn’t tech savvy. He was a dumb kid. If the NSA couldn’t catch him when they have surveillance on every individual in America, what does that say about the effectiveness of their programs? But then again we are standing for whatever the NSA says because nobody is thinking it through; critical thinking has come to a complete standstill in America

It is a hallmark of a totalitarian state to attempt to alter, it is a hallmark of a free and open society, such as a democracy, that a healthy debate takes place through the press and allows challenging information, while it may be upsetting to some, to form a complex, shifting picture, in the reconstruction of an individual’s prior life, as is psychology, with an open mind

**How I entered libertarianism:**

I was young and I was relatively politically inexperienced. I entered libertarianism from a social libertarian way through social media sites like Digg. Mainly it was thanks due to the horrors about the drug war and gun control I picked up from them while I was a social liberal. I reaffirmed my strong atheist position like about 2 or 3 years before Barack Obama was elected. I was sort of your stereotypical /r/atheist user who is obsessed with Scandinavian liberalism

After Barack Obama wasn't as good was I hoped he was in 2009, John Stossel's Shows, and Penn and Teller's TV show called ""Bullshit.""

I thought: ""Wow, and viewing things from an austro-libertarian lense. It also led me to view economics in a sort of Austrian, rational, and absolute sense with no outside forces.

Eventually me interacting with these people led me to interacting with minarchists and anarcho-capitalists. I developed a sort of individualistic philosophy where only the individual mattered, the market could provide what the state provided with voluntary interactions, and that the state always screws and distorts the market creating inefficiencies with waste. It was a really dogmatic experience in general.

**TL;DR:** *Naive

---

**How I left libertarianism:**

At first it was me transitioning into moral nihilism. Where I rejected natural rights and realized that everything moral was subjective and did not exist. I still sorta do

So I was a market anarchist / anti-statist with no adjectives for a while. I then rejected a society purely without law afterwards, so I came to explore [polycentric law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycentric_law) because I realized anarchist / anti-statist solutions to sustaining a stateless society made no sense and were impracticable. I found this to be the only viable solution providing that people who did not pay for law, would receive no protection and that free-riders would not exist in such a society.

Then I realized I did not care in what manner law was provided

The next step was me realizing there was little difference between private property, have arbitrary rules, and thus have little differences between the way they are sustained and the rules they make.

The final blow I think was my interest in positive psychology and behavioral economics. I learned that the libertarian notion of utility is absolutely vague and arbitrary, and obese people. They could all be objectively well off and psychologically happier if they broke their addiction. I thus rejected a rational model of economics and learned that psychology is just as important in economics.

Around the last 3 is when I decided I could no longer call myself an anti-statist or a libertarian. I interacted with more libertarians and I just found myself distancing myself away from them.

**TL;DR:** *Nah

**Edit:** *I should add between the period of time where I made the distinction between law and state

**Edit 2:** *I also felt like a stateless society has never properly existed

Let's have honest discussion about the merits and ills of libertarianism and the future merge of conservatism and libertarianism. ,Lastfall,118,37,792,"Libertarians seem to be a very strong force on the internet and their tone is often very ... uncompromising

Personally I feel libertarians ought to start more flexible on their political goals if they ever want to achieve something. The libertarian movement seems to be heavily influenced by a very deontological approach to ""making politics"". A lot of libertarian I've meet tend to insist on the purity of their ideals a hundred percent and by default are very dismissive and hostile towards other political believes. While there is merits in ""staying true to their believes"" I feel that it makes it impossible for the mainstream of other people to find a middle ground with the libertarian ideology. If you view government as evil and taxes as theft there is no middle ground for me as a progressive liberal to discuss with you and while I can take your opinion seriously there is no way for me to ever consider joining forces with you on any topic. 

That brings me to my second point: A lot of libertarians act like libertarianism is the only true way there is and everybody not believing in it either lacks knowledge and is need to be educated, explains the existence of the state with early childhood abuse and is accusing everybody who doesn't share his opinion as a victim of abuse (and hence unable to comprehend the value of freedom). While this opinion certainly is very extreme, a lot of libertarian seem to at least share the theoretical underpinning of it. 

I think libertarians are in need to develop some empathy for the position of other ideologies and as a result of be more critical towards their own position. It's as important for me to understand why someone feels like high taxes are unjust as for him to understand why I am in support of the a public healthcare system. Dismissive hand waving, is not very convincing for me and often ignores the historical necessities that have driven the development of government in the last century .

Yes, coauthors, and sponsors. But unless those folks are on a committee or subcommittee assigned to the bill, the best they can do, until it comes up for a floor vote at least, is glad handle you. 

Here's how it is done.  

**STEP ONE** Identify the committee or subcommittee currently reviewing the bill.

The thread link is to the Congressional website entry for HR 499. (No ads, it has been assigned to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations.

**STEP TWO** Identify the members of the current committee and/or subcommittee. (If it's in a subcommittee

Here is the main page for House Committees: [http://www.house.gov/committees/](http://www.house.gov/committees/)

The Subcommittee on Crime, and Investigations is a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. You can follow that link to the Committee page: [http://judiciary.house.gov/](http://judiciary.house.gov/)

Notice in the About Page menu the links to all the members of the committees

(If this bill gets any traction and makes it out of the House

Beyond the government use, we can't sell ourselves into indentured servitude anymore. I'm sure there are libertarians who would argue we should be able to, but the vast majority would find that line of thinking morally repugnant. So why not extend individual protections for control of our physical bodies to control of our non-physical identities? 

If companies would be losing valuable information then at the very least couldn't we have requirements that those data points be made anonymous for those purposes? Is that even possible?

I guess what I'm getting at is that when any person goes online every single website they visit is pulling location information, and we definitely all tacitly agree to these business practices on one level or another. But maybe we'd be better off if it wasn't so simple. Maybe it'd be better if any sort of trade-off regarding personal information for access occurred under a more limited framework. Maybe a company can use that info but can't sell it. Maybe there has to be some sort of ""black box"" clearinghouse that the info passes through making it impossible to link it back to a specific individual. Maybe something else.

The upshot of all of this, this might be a way to increase the value of this information to the point where a media consumer can trade their data in an anonymous way and benefit content providers even more. 

All of that aggregated data about you is cheap right now because it can come from anywhere and is traded cheaply. If a particular website can't sell your information but only provide a base for targeted advertising that would increase ad rates for that particular website and increase their revenue

Cain slew his brother. . . and the Lord put a mark upon him

You see some classes of the human family that are black, disagreeable and low in their habits, wild, and seemingly deprived of nearly all the blessings of the intelligence that is generally bestowed upon mankind. The first man that committed the odious crime of killing one of his brethren will be cursed the longest of any one of the children of Adam. Cain slew his brother. Cain might have been killed, and that would have put a termination to that line of human beings. This was not to be, and the Lord put a mark upon him, which is the flat nose and black skin. Trace mankind down to after the flood, until that curse is removed.""


**Joseph Fielding Smith** -- not to be confused with Joseph Smith

""There is a reason why one man is born black and with other disadvantages, more or less, to the laws that were given us there. Those who were faithful in all things there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less."" 

In 1954

""The reason that one would lose his blessings by marrying a Negro is due to the restriction placed upon them. 'No person having the least particle of Negro blood can hold the Priesthood' (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth Negro or one-hundred and sixth

* Gay Marriage, if these women were in proper facilities that were clean and regulated by the Department of Health, a lot of these women and johns would be better off.

Conservatives resist change as hard as they can, segregation was ended, the church's power has been reduced to practically nothing, and the list goes on and on. It's like trying to stop a river with your hands. If the people want change, it *will* happen.

Additionally, NASA’s entire budget since 1958 is only $534.38 billion. Surely, uniting humankind under the banner of exploration, scientific advancement and pushing the limits of human ingenuity is better than another war plane to slaughter other humans. 

NASA is only one example of where nearly $400 billion could be used to aid humanity instead of destroy it. Granted, but the overreaching majority of publicly-known projects are to further engineering, medical, and biological scientific endeavors. 

Although it is easy to dispute where this money and time is spent

According to a Reuters report on the F-35, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey. “Israel and Japan have also placed orders, and Singapore may soon follow suit,” the Reuters article states. 

South Korea is reportedly looking at 60 fighters, and the investment for 15 test planes. Why so many? 

Some people say it’s to overhaul the U.S.’s structurally aging aircraft, are more than 26-years-old on average. But, considering aircraft can go 70 or 80 years before retirement, and since most reported current U.S. conflicts involving fighter jets are bombing campaigns and air support, not air-to-air combat, is the overhaul on such a drastic scale necessary? Does the U.S. Air Force alone truly need 22 different variations of this plane? 

Is the U.S. military truly so paranoid that the country will be attacked the very moment the country stops spending more money on defense than nearly every other industrialized country combined? Why is such an overwhelming fighter jet presence necessary

------


Here are my thoughts about those first graders in Newtown for those who asked me this morning: I teach first grade. I know those gap-tooth wonders and I love them more than most people know, the stomach acid churns. This preamble has the single point of sharing that not many people on this planet grieve more over the loss of a first grader. 

The other day Mike Huckabee stated that the reason for the shooting in Newtown

What we fail to realize is that in that first grade classroom in Newtown, Sarah Palin, Hilary Clinton, Jesse Jackson, Mitt Romney, and any other person with whom we either rally behind or curse. You know who else was in that classroom? The perpetrator of this tragedy as well as the ones involved in other tragedies in other schools, places of worship, or street corners—including the ones that don’t make national news due to the small number of souls involved. 

Why does something like this happen? Forget about the guns for a moment and look at the way liberals treat conservatives, democrats treat republicans. Look at the way we speak about those who, perhaps, speak impulsively or even foolishly. Look at what we say when a particular law is passed or a certain candidate wins or loses a race. We have these horrid episodes because we have not learned how to disagree. We have not learned how to be nice to each other. We have not learned that essential truth about wisdom. It is NOT the kind of things we say or do that make us wise, but that we learn to say or do kind things. 

We model right here on Facebook, most acrimonious, hateful behavior minute by minute, all 525,600 of them in a year. When a student reacts in an incomprehensible manner, such as what happened in Newtown, we suddenly become all about the children, all about how innocent they are. We are filled with grief

We are all in that Newtown first grade classroom. Those who use guns responsibly and want to continue that practice are in that classroom. Those who wonder why the United States has 9, and those who love the security a gun provides are in that classroom. Those who think mental health care should be guaranteed for all—or at least easier to obtain than a rifle—are in that classroom. Mitt Romney is in that classroom. Barack Obama is in that classroom and so are you and me. Until we learn to live with each other, talk to each other, disagree politely with each other, respect each other, and even forgive each other a little bit, these episodes or ones very similar will continue to happen again and again and again. I mourn the loss of our next Barack Obama, our next Sarah Palin. First grade children grow up and part of our tragedy is that we do not know our loss. We all died a little bit in that Newtown first grade classroom because we are just one people. 

That is also our hope.

**The setup**: 

One of the ways US politics can be understood is as multi-decade eras, others fight a long losing battle on defense, certain tactics and methods of accomplishing goals are more commonly used while others from previous eras are left in the past, etc. These eras typically have a defined start and end, bookended by critical shifts that set up a holding pattern that persists for decades. 

People define these eras differently of course; some say we're still in the era Reagan started, and it will be impossible to say with any certainty until a new President is in office or the parties controlling the Presidency and Congressional majority reverse themselves).

We're all familiar with this current political climate, liberal Democratic majority in the House and a Democratic minority leader in the Senate with the tenacity and singular focus of Mitch McConnell), IMO we would see very similar tactics and dynamics, considering the economic situation and dual pressures of needing to reduce the deficit &amp; debt and increasing economic need among the people. So I define the current political climate as one where: 

* Denying the opposition victory is the top priority; all conventional ideological and party goals take a back seat. The days of bipartisanship as the rule rather than the exception are over. 

* The moral line for what collateral damage (harm to the US economy, etc) is unacceptable continually shifting to allow for greater harm in pursuit of the political goal. The proposal of something like 'the sequester' as serious policy would have been unthinkable even 5 years ago, and when it was proposed and actually passed it was seen as something so bad that both parties would come to their senses before allowing it to happen, and now we're in a time when they just let it happen and shrugged. I expect this line to continue to shift in the direction it's going, where radical proposals of cuts and claims of damage seen as dramatic and sensationalist will come to be seen as normal and accepted (shifting Overton Window on this). 

* The opposition is not legitimate: whether they got in through gerrymandering, damage from leaking a sneaky videotape taken at a donors dinner, etc, the underlying theme is that the winner did not win a fair fight in a fair and square way. 

* (Others can fill in more definitions of this era

**The question**: 

So (regardless of whether you agree with this premise or are willing to suspend disbelief to entertain it for sake of argument) **if this political climate is the new normal... what happens if this goes on for 30-40 years?** And what ultimately brings it to an end?

However, many conservative/right-wing people seem to think it is OK for the government to be doing those things. This makes no sense to me at all. If the government is bad and corrupt at doing things in general, certainly it will be even worse and even more corrupt when it does things in secret?

I understand that there are conservatives who are consistent and therefore do object against secret stuff

Now on the surface, I think we need to think about why the government has done this. 

Now some people have been making a lot of connections to things like ""1984, having the right to assemble or right to free speech. It's kind of radical depending on where you look at it, but it ultimately tries to display the government doing this purposely to help themselves instead of the people. While I think there is merit to that argument in the sense that holding onto our rights is important in scenarios like that, I personally don't think the comparison is entirely accurate for one main reason. 

I think the government truly does believe they are looking out for the people. I don't think this was an effort to deliberately take away our rights for the purpose of subduing anti-government speeches

And why do they want to keep us safe from another terrorist attack? Well, and our views change as nation - leading us to bad decisions like supporting a war against a country based on false intelligence. I highly doubt the government wants that instability.

This pressures the government to take these kinds of extreme

I still think the NSA scandal was wrong; however

Anyone else feel this way?,neveroddoreven,83,19,418,"I began looking into this issue about the same time as everyone else here, the banning of assault rifles. Now, into the discussion I delved.

Soon after I started I began to see where the anti-gun control advocates were coming from on this. One of the main things I asked myself after the initial emotional response was, someone on the right (at least of this issue) will tell you that such measures won't really save that many lives. According to FBI data 323 people were murdered in 2011 by rifles (not exclusively assault even). Now compare this number to deaths by handguns, 6220. From here it would seem the logical approach to saving lives through gun control would be to ban handguns, seeing as they are the largest problem in terms of firearms. But as far as I'm aware of, very very few Americans support this idea. I personally think it would be a complete violation of the second amendment.

Then, but really I still think that the main goal of any legislation in response to this should be to save lives. Isn't that our main priority? Isn't that what is being asked of the president and congress? 

Another thing they responded to was the claim that any such ban would be a violation of the second amendment by the anti-gun control crowd. Democrats and liberals argued that the amendment does guarantee our right to arms, makes it illegal to ""manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, it is a logical restriction on the second amendment that really isn't too controversial. Hell

Lastly, they seem to be correct. Which, yet again, if we are trying to save lives why are we focusing on idiotic things such as how the gun looks rather than how deadly is it?

Ideally, I realize that asking Americans to step outside their little box, to sway from their norm is asking a lot. I know we have this mentality that voting for 3rd party might as well be voting for the other guy, so here is what I propose:

Vote for your party like you always have, cast a vote that would be heard loud and clear by the US government. It would send a message that would change the way congress governs for years to come.

In my opinion we should be aiming for a 100% turn over in congress. Most of these people are career politicians and they want to do whatever it takes to stay in office. Whatever it takes should be what the people of America want. If we don't get what we want

I'm pretty certain that the vast majority of Americans are unhappy with the current state of affairs and the trend in the police state

1334577017.0,sc97h,Why do Americans misrepresent European politics so badly?,abowsh,78,16,211,"For example, and where grandma has to wait 6 months to visit her doctor.


Now


Both of these characterizations are extremely inaccurate. Republicans ignore the many advantages and positive aspects of many Europeans policies such as healthcare and education. They gain a sliver of credibility when they speak of the debt issues, Denmark or Sweden. They make it seem like the costs of education in Europe would cripple our economy (news flash: student loans are already crippling our economy, Europe is doing much better in this case) From listening to a Republican, you would think that Europe is hell.

Now, ignoring the much higher tax rates that the common middle class citizen pays. (This is my biggest issue with some on the left: the belief that we can fund Europeans style social programs by simply taxing the rich, and allowing the rest of the country to pay extremely low tax rates) They create this fantasy world where everything is taken care of and there are no problems. They tout the amazing public transit in Europe, but ignore the very high costs of living in the cities they praise.  


I would like to have a discussion on why this is? Europe is the worst possible outcome for Republicans and the best possible outcome for Democrats. It just seems like they will lie and misrepresent anything they possibly can about these countries in order to further their position.

Apparently President Obama can’t see Egypt and Libya from his house. On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks ever perpetrated on America, destroyed our flag, and replaced it with a black Islamic banner. In Benghazi, the armed gunmen set fire to our consulate and killed an American staff member. The Islamic radicals claim that these attacks are in protest to some film criticizing Islam. In response to this, the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a statement that was so outrageous many of us thought it must be a satire. The embassy actually apologized to the violent mob attacking us, and it even went so far as to chastise those who use free speech to “hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.” (Funny, the current administration has no problem hurting the “religious feelings” of Catholics.)


But where is the president’s statement about this? These countries represent his much touted “Arab Spring.” How’s that Arab Spring working out for us now? Have we received an apology yet from our “friends” in the Muslim Brotherhood for the assault on our embassy? 


It’s about time our president stood up for America and condemned these Islamic extremists. I realize there must be a lot on his mind these days – what with our economy’s abysmal jobless numbers and Moody’s new warning about yet another downgrade to our nation’s credit rating due to the current administration’s failure to come up with a credible deficit reduction plan. And, softball interviews with the “Pimp with the Limp,” and fundraising dinners with his corporate cronies. But our nation’s security should be of utmost importance to our Commander-in-chief. America can’t afford any more “leading from behind” in such a dangerous world. We already know that President Obama likes to “speak softly” to our enemies. If he doesn’t have a “big stick” to carry, maybe it’s time for him to grow one.

I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago.

He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.

“Americans woke up this morning with tragic news and felt heavy hearts as they considered that individuals who have served in our diplomatic corps were brutally murdered across the world. This attack on American individuals and embassies is outrageous, the cause of freedom, and justice and honor. We mourn their loss and join together in prayer that the spirit of the Almighty might comfort the families of those who have been so brutally slain.

Four diplomats lost their life, Libya. And, of course, with these words, I extend my condolences to the grieving loved ones, who have left behind, as a result of these who have lost their lives in the service of our nation

America will not tolerate attacks against our citizens and against our embassies. We will defend also our constitutional rights of speech and assembly and religion. We have confidence in our cause in America. We respect our Constitution. We stand for the principles our Constitution protects. We encourage other nations to understand and respect the principles of our Constitution because we recognize that these principles are the ultimate source of freedom for individuals around the world.

I also believe the Administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States Government to condemn attacks on Americans

The attacks in Libya and Egypt underscore that the world remains a dangerous place and that American leadership is still sorely needed. In the face of this violence, but also poses the potential for peril, if the forces of extremism and violence are allowed to control the course of events.

We must strive to ensure that the Arab Spring does not become an Arab Winter.”

**Condoleeza Rice issues statement on Ambassador Stevens:**

""I am saddened by the tragic loss of life at our Consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens was a wonderful officer and a terrific diplomat who was dedicated to the cause of freedom. His service in the Middle East throughout his career was legendary.

My thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of all of the fallen. They will be sorely missed but never forgotten.""


**Final Edit**

I think the most important thing to note here is that this was not an act by the government of Egypt or the government of Libya. They were originally seen to be acts by mobs

The following is a brief description of the problems of modern society as well as the solutions to these problems

According to Marx and Hegel, where individuals act for their own interests first, while the political realm is concerned with the benefits of all. 

What Marx believed was that there was a need to 'politicize' Civil Society, was that the freedoms of Civil Society would have to be constrained in order to accomplish this. 

On the other hand, was also aware of the 'tragic' element of allowing Civil Society to continue in this self-interested way: a truly free civil society would inevitably mean continued oppression of the poorer classes of society by the powerful. However, for Hegel, there was something quintessentially valuable about the freedom of Civil Society, and we simply need to accept the 'tragedy' of Civil Society as a consequence of these freedoms. 


To me, there is a lot more to Marxism, but this central 'politicising Civil Society' is perhaps his most central tenet. I wonder how many people here are aware of this (probably COMPLETELY preaching to the choir, but I think this would be an interesting discussion). ",,False,,1348588936.0,t3_10gdtq

ARTICLE IV:  ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized"".

ARTICLE V:  ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger...nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.""

  How easy it is for us to pass judgement on the less fortunate.  The argument made in the picture above is partially correct but it's also invalid.  Sure

  I believe that unless a criminal offense has already been committed that drug testing without a warrant is illegal PERIOD.  This means anytime you go to get a job or now in some cases apply for welfare.  You can't set a double standard.  It must be uniform across the board.  Articles four and five of our Bill of Rights above state that drug testing without probable cause is a clear violation of our fundamental rights.

So let me make something clear in addition to this. The Constitution allows a provision that states we are not to self incriminate.  I say ban warrantless drug testing. PERIOD.

What about when the conspiracy is true?  In addition, and save America? 

For the record
  
The idea that the (primarily old-money) super-rich politically influential members of society and the corporations they control are working together to disadvantage the poor and minorities, manipulation of the media, and government legislation.  
  
“There is...an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth
  
Those with wealth and power will always seek to protect their wealth and power.  They are threatened by you and me.  They fear our creative potential.  *They fear our ability to become rich and powerful and dilute their influence.*  They are working to move society to one solidly divided between the rich ruling class and the oppressed poor.  People can be motherfuckers sometimes.  It is *not* unreasonable to believe that those with wealth and power might in fact be motherfuckers working for their own benefit giving no fucks about anyone else.  They want to encourage everyone to be""part of the system"" because they control the system.  They want you to grow up to be unquestioning of authority

The less educated, and the relationship between campaign funding and electoral success show how powerful manipulation of the media really is.  The rich own the media.  They can't own the internet.  Surprised about SOPA and ACTA yet?

Social conditioning goes much farther than that.  Our society has been molded into one of conformity.  ""Go to school get good grades, exactly how you're told is encouraged.  People are trying to promote the idea that it is ""Un-American"" to pursue socially progressive policy, even though that's what brought America into the international spotlight as a successful world leading nation.  We are taught that we should not question our government or its employees when they abuse their power.  We are being molded into the perfect working class to support the ruling elite.

Now that the poor are trapped and will always remain poor,_locks_shareholders_out_of_annual_meeting/) and remove the idea of leading being responsible to those over which they rule.  CEOs are racing for the highest margins and biggest bonuses instead of focusing on worker productivity and fair profit sharing.  I think it's safe to say they don't care about the working class.
  
Legislation almost never fails to benefit those with the best funded lobbying groups and biggest campaign donations, the rich who have an agenda to push.  Major corporations have found out [it's cheaper to legislate away new competition than compete.](http://www.alternet.org/economy/154962/Corruption_Is_Responsible_for_80%25_of_Your_Cell_Phone_Bill/?page=2) (alcohol, tobacco, and pharma vs marijuana for another example).  Profits are not shared fairly with those who contribute most to the company's output and is instead concentrated at the top.  The idea that being good to ""the shareholders"" is more important than being good to your workers is reprehensible and serves to demonstrate the social conditioning that protecting individuals and corporations is more important than benefiting the foundation of American society and productivity.  They want you to care more about them than each other.

If our leaders are unwilling to accept responsibility and don't get voted out of office this shows how easy it is for the ruling class to walk all over ordinary citizens.
  
As someone who cares about America, and to push towards greater education and higher incomes for everybody, as this is historically proven to push America to its greatest heights. Allowing those who are rich and powerful to become richer and more powerful is not in the interest of all. It is in the interest of those who are rich and powerful. If we do not question authority and challenge its motives we leave ourselves open to manipulation. I do not ask others to blindly agree with what I have to say, I ask them to listen rationally to my argument and consider its merit.  
  
I shall close my argument with quotes from an inspiring patriot:  
  
“If once the people become inattentive to the public affairs, Judges and Governors, shall all become wolves. *It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions.*”  
  
“A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both
  
“Leave no authority existing not responsible to the people.”

Since weed is a schedule I controlled substance it is illegal to possess or manufacture

Obama could ask AG Holder to look into [rescheduling marijuana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act#Process) and follow the process laid out by the Controlled Substance Act to do that. To my knowledge this is the only power that the executive has to reschedule or unschedule a drug. This process is very lengthly and groups have been doing it unsuccessfully by petition for decades.

I have no doubt that many regulations are very well-meaning and many times even have the desired effect, and [here](http://businomics.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341cd0c953ef0154360808d2970c-800wi))  You'll notice that these are also some of our more-regulated industries.  It's important to see how they got to this point so that in the future we can prevent the creation and further consolidation of these powerful, politically-connected companies.

I don't think we have an oligopoly to the extent of Russia, but you are also at a regulatory disadvantage due to compliance costs eating into a greater percentage of your profit.  Due to the nature of compounding returns, this seemingly benign regulatory advantage will have major effects on overall profitability over a span of 15-20 years.  It could mean the difference between remaining a competitor in the industry or deciding to be bought out by a major incumbent.  Just look at the consolidation in some of our more regulated industries to see what I'm talking about.

From the evidence, from the most well-meaning and successful to the most vile, obvious competition-killing variety pushed by major corporations, help to create the giant, politically-connected corporations that we all despise.  I'm not saying that all regulation does more harm than good, but the evidence does suggest that there are consequences to regulation that seem to go unnoticed.  These consequences should be weighed against the benefit a potential regulatory rule is likely to bring.  Is the benefit worth the reduced competition these industry incumbents will face from startups?  We should also go through existing regulations and get rid of the rules that have likely had an overall negative effect (where the cons outweigh the pros).  There are two ways of keeping major corporations in check.  One is to regulate them, the other is to make them compete.  The latter method appears to have been lacking over the past few decades.

TL;DR - Regulation is a double-edged sword, resulting in higher profitability.  The major players in these industries are the corporations we love to hate, and regulation helped create them.

2. The support for banning semi-automatics has dropped in the past decade

3. It's in the constitution. I have been to the states lots of times and they take their constitution very seriously. Soldiers swear loyalty to the document when they join the US military. Like it or not

4. States will revolt against too-restrictive bans. There are some states that have their own ""2nd amendments"" in their constitutions and laws have been passed in Montana for instance

5. USA is already swimming in guns and sales are at an all-time high.

""If government subsidized birth control

The answer lies with the difference between deontology and consequentialism.

Deontology is a rule-based ethics system.  For instance

Consequentialism is a consequences-based ethics system

So advocates for subsidized birth control in the name of reducing the number of abortions start from a consequentialist premise.  It sees no inherent rightness or wrongness with subsidizing birth control

Opponents of subsidized birth control, they see inherent wrongness in coercing people of faith, via taxation, to pay for subsidies for something that they object to morally.

The reason I bring this up is because the argument I cited above - ""why aren't more pro-life conservatives in favor of subsidized birth control?"" - is usually met in response with some sinister explanation of the pro-lifers' ""true motivations"".  That they are insincere in their beliefs, that they hate the poor, etc., etc.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  It is simply a matter of starting from a different premise.

And it makes a great deal of sense too

Yes it is POSSIBLE that a pro-lifer somewhere really does oppose abortion and oppose subsidized birth control because of genuine misogyny or some other bad-faith reason.  But that is not the mainstream

1334287692.0,s7dqq,Can soldier homecomming videos be considered propaganda?,saintwhiskey,76,26,18,"I posted this in response to another redditor who simply called a homecoming video propaganda and was swiftly down voted. For awhile now I've held the same conviction and I wanted to articulate my point. That's why I'm cross posting my comment into this sub. 

""...I will agree with ___, or to support a member of their family. I expect and respect that.

However, do not know these people and can only relate to them on very broad terms. Although I fit into almost the exact same demographic as the subjects presented, in my experience, I have a significantly less amount of empathy for someone I watch on footage than I do for people observed in real life. So because the connection between myself and the subject is made over the internet I don't weigh them the same as those around me.

To me, is just one more item of content in a larger box of media I've experience before. I file them under the soldier-homecoming box, if you will. So, as this box becomes more full and the details less clear, I form a generalizing emotion towards them; seeing these peoples happiness makes me happy. Since I mentioned my lack of empathy for people in videos then you would understand that my happiness is far less compared to the elation the subjects experienced. In fact it's sort of dull and ignorable.

If we step back even further and look at the full range of media I can access we see even more contents for a still larger box. I place my soldier-homecoming box next to the war-movies box inside the american-war-media crate, and moral nobility. Next to those boxes is the patriotic-music box where boots are forced into the asses of terrorists and so on. If my general emotion is positive and I don't have to think too hard to come to that conclusion, then I will just go ahead and stick with it because that is easier than disagreeing with something and not being able to do anything about it.

The more and more media content I consume, lets say there is a media machine with a political agenda. If they could make sure most of the content a nations population consumes is positive about something by tagging on powerful words like ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" or ""patriotism"" to it, they could potentially generate a collective conscience about an issue. Words like ""family,"" ""reunited,"" and ""hero"" work even better - anyone who disagrees with that must be barbaric. The next step is to chastise people for not sharing in that collective conscience and if that picks up

The brilliant piece is that our society loves putting this kind of stuff online. Nobody is forcing us. My contention is that if I see more positive than negative things about the war, this style of video is a thinly veiled, although incredibly clever, propaganda campaign.

**tl;dr The majority of media regarding American wars is positive, music, or whatever. This fuels popular opinion. If there is an unseen hand making sure this media is positive, they would be using a marketing campaign that I would consider pro-war propaganda.""**

Never mind that the republicans are filibustering their own shadow forcing crazy compromise on fucking everything.

News flash prom date

So since yall are all constantly high or something let's review some of the extremely progressive shit Obama has done

--------

&gt;*Day 1* (literally) : Bush's last minute fed regulations are nixed.  Pay freeze for anyone in the White House making $100k or more.  Sets up guidelines for lobbyist and the whitehouse.  DAY FUCKING ONE.

&gt;*Day 2* : Obama nixes and executive order Bush setup to limit access to presidental records.  He tells dept's to comply better with freedom of information request.

&gt;*Day 3* : He issues an executive order to shut down Guantanamo Bay within 1 year.  CONGRESS PASSES A BILL DEFUNDING THIS EFFORT.  Many of you fucks seem to have forgotten that our govt is a balance of power and *OBAMA WASN'T ELECTED SAVIOR*.

&gt;*Day 4* : Obama ends the funding ban for groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad

&gt;*Day 5* : OBAMA POST SOME SHIT ON YOUTUBE.

--------

Now that I've warmed yall up a bit let's jump into the broader shit he's done : 

- completely change how the world views america?  consider that one a freebe.

- stem cells.  remember the last idiot pres was against them?  obama supports stem cell shit.

- green energy?  obama is all up in that ass too.  you done forgot.

- don't ask don't tell?  thing of the past.  law was signed in dec 2010.  bitches.

- War in iraq? ya

- Ossama?  DEAD.

- Help women and minorities get $ for businesses?  CHECK.

- Expand loan programs for small businesses?  CHECK.

- Setup the credit card bill of rights to keep companies from fucking you so hard?  DONE.

- Require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.  Boy Obama sure is a republican asshole.

- Require large employers to contribute to a national health plan if they don't have their own plan.

- Expand eligibility for Medicaid.  GOD HE'S PRACTICALLY A TEA-PARTIER.

- Do a bunch of other health care shit you forgot about?  YUP.  Maybe you should get off the reddit echo chamber?

- Appoint a special adviser to the president on violence against women

- Reduce nuclear weapons stock piles

- Give states extra $ for child care

- Increase funding for national parks and forests.  MAN THIS GUY IS JUST LIKE DUBYA HERP DERP.

- Expand Pell grants for low-income students

- Review mandatory minimum sentences

- Last space shuttle flight?  YUP HE DID THAT TOO.  Bush had the last 1 slatted for Sep 2010 via funding.

- Appoint the nation's first Chief Technology Officer

- Create a national declassification center

- Ban lobbyist gifts to executive branch employees

- Create new criminal penalties for mortgage fraud

- Require 10 percent renewable energy by 2012

- Invest in all types of alternative energy

- Double federal spending for research on clean fuels

- Increase funding for the Environmental Protection Agency

- Support network neutrality on the Internet

*THIS IS THE SHORT LIST*

God this guy is such a FUCKING ASSHOLE.  He's practically a carbon copy of Bush.  If we put Rick Perry in there you wouldn't be able to tell the fucking difference!

So next time someone claims Obama hasn't gotten anything done remind them that they are talking out of their fucking ass and that their opinion has no relation to reality - at fucking all.

Is Obama perfect?  No.  But given the pussy ass congress he has to work with I think he's done pretty good.

Senator Watson having the floor forcefully taken from him without a chamber vote was also rather shocking.

* Do we as constituents have the right to take issue with their seeming disregard for their own rules and proceedings?

1356015748.0,1563t0,Would you pay more taxes for more focus on higher education in America.,MepMepperson,90,40,119,"I had an interesting thought last night

My proposal:  

Everyone should have the ability to go through higher education.

My Reasoning:  

My perceived problem with America is people who are mentally stuck in high school.  College gives most of us the opportunity to mature and grow up.  We get things out of our system, a desire to continue educating ourselves.

My Observations:  

Whenever controversial thoughts are being pushed due to religious views, of course you'll end up thinking like them.  If your parents raise you to think that something is wrong, you've probably got 14 or 15 years (Realistically, more like 18 or 20 years (till you leave home)) of them drilling those thoughts into your head before you really start questioning it yourself.

My proposed solution:

There is a saying that ""Those that know the least, but it seems that when we do find some cash, it should be put towards more state universities, more pay for teachers (so more qualified people want to be teachers), and more financial aide for students.

The biggest change I'd suggest would be including the first semester of Freshman year at a state university as a publicly supported item.  Similar to how we pay for students to go through high school with our taxes.  Giving students the opportunity at higher learning and allowing them the option to continue it would be a better use of our tax dollars.  I certainly would feel better about higher taxes if I knew it was going to higher learning instead of any number of government programs.

Just opening it up for a discussion.  Would you be willing to pay slightly higher taxes to raise the overall education of our country?

Transcript of the important bits follows:

&gt; ….there’s a reason education SUCKS,  EVER be fixed.

&gt; It’s never going to get any better, don’t want that. I’m talking about the real owners now, the BIG owners! The Wealthy… the REAL owners! The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.

&gt; Forget the politicians. They are irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice! You have OWNERS! They OWN YOU. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought—and paid for—the Senate, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

&gt; They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want:

&gt; They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed

&gt; That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

&gt; You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street—and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later ‘cause they own this fucking place! It’s a big club, and you ain’t in it! You, and I, are not in the big club.

&gt; By the way, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue—these are people of modest means—continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don’t give a fuck about you….they don’t give a fuck about you… they don’t give a FUCK about you.

&gt; They don’t care about you at all… at all… AT ALL.  And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red

There would also be a reduction of violence rather than a common misconception of an increase in violence. One might say that increased drug use leads to murders, and other real crimes, but aren't every one of those crimes due to the fact that the drug is illegal? Take alcohol for example: When prohibition reigned over the United States in the 1920s, there was a drastic increase in violence and organized crime due to the fact that it was illegal to manufacture, sell, and consume alcohol. But, once alcohol became legal, but Mexico, imagine the reduction of gang violence. Many gangs rely solely on the drug trade. If drugs became legal

Not only would violence decrease, the demand decreases due to an easier way of receiving the drug (you don't have to go to a dealer anymore that has the risk of jail time from manufacturing or trafficking; you don't need a prescription from a doctor, etc.) and the supply increases because companies (competing firms results in lower prices) will jump on to the opportunity to make a profit off of the drug (capitalism 101). Now obviously, drugs are proven to be bad for you, not just the illegal ones but tobacco, alcohol, some prescription drugs, so decreasing the price obviously sounds bad. But, steal cars

The point of arguing something along the lines of ""meth/cocaine/heroin should be illegal because you can harm someone else while on the drug"" is absolutely ridiculous. You can harm someone just as easily with alcohol as you could cocaine or any other illegal drug. And, anyone with a basic understanding of drugs knows that they are harmful. If any illegal drug were to become legal, would you run out of your house to go overdose on heroin? No. Because you are smart. The government is not saving you from drugs. You are already doing that by sitting at the computer and reading this. The government is simply restricting your rights.

1360253356.0,182j14,Ending the War on Drugs,arthurpaliden,69,22,98,"Ending the 'War on Drugs' will not only save billions but also save lives

Lets start with a few facts;

First and foremost:

Just as there have always been poor in our society

Second:

The cost of the war on drugs in direct and indirect costs (policing, insurance, lost wages...) to each person, man woman and child, in the United States is believed to be on the order of about $250.00 to $500.00 per year.

Third:

The large majority of all murders in the United States

Fourth:

Drug trafficking and its resultant corruption is responsible for the instability of several countries in the world and in some cases directly finances terrorist organizations.

Fifth:

Business

Six:

Drug trafficking is a business.  


Introduction:

The war on drugs is costly and regardless what the government says we are loosing it.  Drug related crime cost billions of dollars both in taxes and insurance costs not to mention lives.  So what are we going to do?  Here is a bold new idea that results in beneficial domestic and international results.


Soft Drugs:

First, how many freelance alcohol dealers do you see plying young people with moonshine. This also frees up police resources that will result in a lowering of taxes and in addition governments will be collecting new 'sin' taxes on the marijuana . 
But you say, probably no more than are already doing it today.  The status quo will be maintained. 
Yes, there is a simple test the officer can give to determine blood alcohol levels”. This is true and currently there is none for marijuana. There is none 'currently' for marijuana.  Given the requirement of such a test businesses will be more than happy to develop one.  Just the same as they were more than happy to develop the hand held breathalyser in order to detect alcohol levels.
And yes

Hard Drugs:

Secondly, that they can then fill up at the corner pharmacy for a fraction of the current street price. This reduces the requirement for the addict to steal, reducing insurance rates, or having to create a new crop of addicts that he can sell to. What, you say make hard drugs freely available. No, what I said was that people who are CONFIRMED addicts can get prescriptions for their drug of choice. Little Johnie or Susie cannot go and get a prescription because they are not already addicted. 
But, an addict can hold down a regular job and provide for themselves. 
So now there is no need for the low end drug trafficker and with out him the entire drug network will collapse because the sales force will not be there to move the product because 
place. Just think you can lower your taxes, stop drug related crimes, prevent the majority of new drug addicts for being created and all it takes is to this is to 
treat drug addiction as an illness and not a crime.
Now I admit that there will still be recreational drug use

International Benefits:

This will not only benefit the United States but by causing the collapse of the drug cartels will go a long way to removing corrupting influences from several countries and also remove a major source of financing for terrorist organizations.",,t5_2sfmf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/182j14/ending_the_war_on_drugs/

1324916589.0,nr87n,Why Democracy Doesn't Work,derKapitalist,86,41,198,"CLARIFICATION: This essay is not my work but that of FringeElements


&gt;**Why Democracy Doesn’t Work**

&gt;This is just a quick post reiterating why democracy doesn’t work:

&gt;1) *Rational Ignorance.* Because you only have one vote and won’t influence an election, which is to say **democracy depends on voters being irrational.**

&gt;2) *Package deals.* When you buy things from a store, and so that stuff is harder to find.

&gt;With democracy, and want unemployment insurance to be cut, but each candidate or party is only willing to cut one or the other, so you don’t get to truly vote your preference.

&gt;3) *Voting wars.* Group A votes itself the resources of group B. Simple enough. Elections aren’t really a competition of ideas, and so theft-rationalization industries develop, which rationalize the theft with marxoid economic theories, appeals to racial identity and collective intergenerational debt, and various other obtuse and roundabout justifications.

&gt;One of these rationalizations is to call opponents of democracy social darwinists. They support an evolutionary environment that enables the irresponsible reproduction of their voting blocs at the expense of the responsible reproduction of their opponents, that’s social darwinism. So social darwinism = an evolutionary environment that grants no favoritism to irresponsible reproduction of the takers.

&gt;There is also the problem of the identity-democrat, and so masochistically votes for wealth redistribution schemes that harm him. The identity-democrats tend to be “progressive” on social issues and white, while the taker-democrats tend to be more conservative and black and brown (they are NOT “liberals”, they are racial national socialists).

&gt;4) *Concentrated benefits, and many of them will die. This makes them extremely motivated in opposing cuts. Whereas the people paying for unemployment benefits won’t die from paying a little bit more.

&gt;The results of democracy are manifest - constant increases in spending, as are many of the beneficiaries of democracy-enabled theft.

&gt;One should place democracy in the same ideological zone as communism, if an individual really owned what is called “his home” and “his money”, then you couldn’t just vote to take any of it away to give it to people who don’t have value.

&gt;(That’s another reason many are militantly pro-democracy: without it

&gt;Democracy is a form of communism. And the US is a representative democracy. My prediction is that democracy will be remembered as a form of communism, but difficult for most to swallow.

&gt;One last point is that democracy is inconsistent. Man supposedly needs a state because if left to his own devices it’ll be Mad Max

Schiff manages to catch quite a few OWS protestors flat footed.  Hopefully we can have a more two-sided discussion here.

My additional $0.02 is that Schiff is viewing the issue in terms of 1% vs 99%.  That the 99% want to take from the 1% what they have rightfully earned.  I don't think things are that simple.

*That said: Here are some items which I think could directly benefit our education system.*

**- Tie the Education budget to the Defense budget.**

Defense is and always has been the government's favorite money-sink. If the Education budget were mandated to be maintained at a certain percentage (ideally a 1:1 ratio, our schools would never again play second fiddle to the military. Books or bombs would become Books and Bombs. Not a great catchphrase, I know; but it's better than the current Bombs Not Books. Second, the Defense budget would probably stop expanding as much, since there would be the requirement to raise Education funding each time the Pentagon's budget was increased, and the requirement that the Defense budget be decreased first before any cuts to Education were made. Just a thought.

**- Eliminate Standardized Testing.**

This program has been an abject failure. I don't need to go on and on about it

**- Increase and somewhat standardize matriculation standards.**

It is too easy for students to breeze from one grade level to another without grasping core concepts. There should not be high-school illiteracy, or can't understand basic science concepts, or what have you; then you shouldn't progress farther until you can. There should be a system in place to hold back en masse the students who have not demonstrated competency in concepts which the next grade will build on. Rather than waltzing from grade to grade and potentially ending up not learning hardly anything; students should be given 13 years to progress as far as they can, according to significantly more rigorous standards, before being required to pay tuition if they wish to continue, subject to there being enough space in a classroom. High school diplomas should carry weight again, and college admission and graduation should be a real accomplishment rather than a blasé everyday thing. When Hallmark creates a holiday season out of graduation

**- Remove religion from the classroom.**

Some may disagree, since it forces a particular interpretation onto others, who are in this case likely to be impressionable children. Teachers should be required to keep their religious views out of the classroom under penalty of professional discipline and civil liability. Schools which elect to keep religion in their courses beyond an all-inclusive and purely conceptual overview should not receive taxpayer funds in any amount.

*Just some ideas. I'd like to hear your thoughts.*

**I would have each grade level correspond to a certain ""mastery list"". That is

**I would divide these skills into three lists: red

**Red concepts would be the basic

**Yellow concepts would be slightly less vital concepts

**Green concepts would be non-vital yet still important concepts which the student could definitely catch up on or succeed without most of them

**In addition to any new red, Yellow concepts from the previous grade level would become Red the next grade level up. Green concepts would become Yellow the next grade level up, and Red the grade level after that.**

**The curriculum would be parsed for any superfluous or redundant units of instruction

**Students prevented from advancing would be offered the chance to pay tuition to attend a summer school

During and after college,"" and other thoughts about how liberals have just as many ""stupid people.""

Every election cycle GOP staffers would tell us about the horrible crimes of Democrats

I met a lot of conservatives. Many nice people. All of them were white like me, since I was the same.

**Internet popularity Mid-2000s**

As social networking became popular and so did cable companies, Reddit, Digg, etc., some of them before they were famous. I administrated several popular Facebook Groups that were essentially built to either attack Obama, attack liberals, or promote conservatism. 

I had probably some of the most open and heated debates with liberals during these times. I felt it was necessary to correct them and their stupidity.

I banned quite a few liberals too

After a while, and it seemed ever clear that liberals were always winning those, and conservatives would be forced to revert to Bible quotes and I thought that was very ineffective.

Getting closer to the election

I made some extra cash from my website thanks to traffic from conservative blogs and websites and social networks. I wrote guest articles

----
**Switching to libertarian

I became mostly a libertarian

By this point

Some of these kids on facebook were smart

I must say, but maybe I hated them because they were convincing or persistent.

As much of the consequences of Bush's policies became clear

Made fun of Obama constantly about apologizing to various Muslims, examined the certificate, it was legit. 

I hated Obama simply because I felt he was a one-time senator, I hated catch phrases. It became clear however that experience doesn't mean much as one liberal pointed Nixon's history out to me.

---
**2008 election**

I believed strongly in McCain's message too. I thought picking Palin was some sort of interesting plan that could get the women vote. I knew Palin was one of those stupid conservatives

I was very much libertarian by this point so I was very worried that McCain would continue more Bush policies. I thought that he would also crush civil and social liberties

Spread viral videos depicting Obama as a bumbling fool and depicting Bush as some hero who almost saved us from the financial crisis in 2008. Instead pinning the crisis blame on the poor

It really didn't matter what I used for propaganda, then look around for supporting evidence, ignoring contradictory evidence. I don't do that anymore.

I voted for McCain/Palin 2008 but I didn't quit paying attention to politics.

**2010 election**

Around this time the Tea Party became popular

After the whole health care debates, rather than foreign infections/disease. Libertarians can't seem to answer the question of constitutionality of CDC along with the constitutionality of nationalized healthcare and defense. There's a logical disconnect there.

Well once the tea party took over and they started chanting about death panels

I felt that Obama was just being treated unfairly, and he really didn't, he just changed the message of American leadership to the world.

I read the book, (I first started reading it without buying, because I didn't want to give an atheist money), then I bought the book and finished it. It really opened my eyes.

It helped me better understand why Bush's policies were wrong, but also why non-intervention and Ron Paul-style foreign policies are also very wrong. It's sort of a middle ground and it helped me realize the subtle chess moves that Obama is making in the Middle East and why they are absolutely correct.

1347380047.0,zppyb,WE DID FORGET: Some thoughts for the 11th Anniversary of 9/11,fongaboo,57,13,38,"NEVER FORGET. We hear this every year on this day

But we did forget. We completely forgot our values and way of life

Here are some irreverant but real thoughts to ponder on this day

1) For decades we lived the American dream but we FORGOT that abroad others lived the American nightmare as we carried on years of military adventurism throughout the world. A lot of Americans lived in such blissful ignorance of our aggressive foreign pursuit of American interests throughout the world that they were shocked when we were finally attacked. But even worse

2) It's often been stated that the difference between 'us' and 'them' is that when we fight wars, then we are responsible for the military actions carried out in our name.

3) In the decade following 9/11, NDAA, HR347 combined with un-legislated acts of blatant disregard for the Constitution have resulted in the loss of our freedom. What's worse is we blindly keep celebrating our freedom when it's no longer there. Do folks still mistake freedom for our ability to buy Levis denim jeans while Soviet-era people could not? For better or worse, our vibrant consumer culture hasn't waned. But this is separate and apart from being free. You can still have malls in a police state.

And police state we have:

* Law enforcement and government now routinely wiretap us without the oversight of a judge

* Protection from undue search and seizure are a thing of the past. As is the ability to move freely about the country. Border Patrol and the TSA now set up random arbitrary checkpoints in the middle of highways. We are virtually or literally strip-searched in our airports. Citizens in our cities are routinely stopped and frisked. We FORGOT what we learned in school (at least I did) about the Stasi police in Nazi Germany barking ""papers please"" to civilians and what a contrast it was to our freedom. Now we allow it but somehow think it is fine because it is 'for our own protection'.

* Cross out due process as well. A portion of the military budget bill (NDAA) granted the President new executive powers to infinitely detain any citizen he deems a threat. But he was already targeting and killing American citizens abroad without any sort of a trial. Meanwhile those suspected of terrorism who do make it to trial find themselves indefensible as crucial evidence is withheld from their lawyers due to 'national security concerns'.

4) Russian media is now routinely reporting on America's oppression of freedom

5) What Osama Bin Laden and the terrorists did was brilliant. I couldn't think of a better way to strike a blow to the gut (our economy) and the head (our minds) of a Goliath like the US. We FORGOT that because just because we were big we weren't infallible. We got sucker-punched with the greatest incident of psychological warfare ever perpetrated. And it worked. We laid down our freedoms in the name of safety much to the disgrace of all those who died that day.

&gt; there is no greater force for good in the nation than Christian conscience in action.

He's basically saying Christians in the USA are on a higher ethical / moral plane than anyone else. To me a comment and dedication (as this line of thinking has great influence on actual decisions and can be considered hateful / discriminatory to a non-Christian / non-religious person) like this is an instant disqualification to ever consider voting for the person making such a claim. And that made why wonder on how this would go over in my country:

If a mainstream politician (heading one of the largest parties) in my country had said this a big discussion / shit-storm would've occurred all over the political spectrum. Even the leaders of our largest [Christian party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Appeal) would never use this as a political argument as they acknowledge ""morality and ethics are bound to individuals and are possible as an individual value outside"" (this does not exclude the option that they consider all ""moral individuals"" to be closeted-religious persons ;)).

I know the USA is a much more Christian fundamentalist country than the Netherlands. However I did expect some outcry on this. Yet in the USA media I cannot find anyone who's even moderately surprised or outraged on this. It's not even picked up as one of the talking points of the speech.
The point I wonder about is whether voters in the USA (at least the /reddit subset..) see quotes like this as something to take in account (when making their voting decision) at all?

Historically, that number has fallen. In the 90s, it was 0.4% increase in employment for every 1% increase in growth. In the early 2000s, it was 0.2% for every 1%. This recovery has seen 0.3% increase in employment for every 1% increase in growth.

To me as an economics and political science student

So if we look at [this chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg), real wages increased at almost the exact same rate. In fact, the only exception is when real wage increases exceeded productivity increases from roughly 1955 to 1965. However, real wages stagnated around 1975 and began to fall a little bit. At the same time, productivity continued to increase rapidly and is now double what it was in 1975 while real wages are lower.

In the earlier part of American industrialization, 40 hour work week, overtime pay, etc. The 40 hour work week has been around since the 1940s at least, yet a worker today only has to work a quarter of the time to produce as much as a worker in the 1940s or half the time as a worker in the 1970s.

It seems to me that we do not have a growth problem right now so much as a massive unemployment problem that nobody seems to be addressing. No matter how much our economy grows

That is why I am of the belief that we must see new labor policy shortening the work week, it seems that these measures might increase unemployment if implemented improperly, so I believe the increases in benefits and wages must be paid for by lowered incomes for the wealthiest of Americans. Let me stress that it is not because I have anything against these people or because I do not believe they earned their money. It is simply because the massive concentration of wealth AND (perhaps more importantly) **new wealth** is detrimental to the entire economy.

* Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act in 1935 and FDR created the Works Progress Administration to administer the funds. 

* The initial appropriation for the WPA was $4.88 billion- equivalent to 135% of federal revenue in 1935 or 6.7% of GDP ([keep in mind that GDP grew approximately 30% from 1933 to 1935](http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=1933&amp;LastYear=1935&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no#Mid)). 

* The 2011 equivalent of a WPA appropriation would be approximately $973 billion in direct outlays.  

* The WPA built 78,000 new tunnels.

* The WPA built 6,170 others, and modernized 31,000 more. 

* The WPA was also responsible for building 1

* The WPA also built 9

* WPA projects also included 226 new hospitals and 156 improved ones.

* Office space was also expanded as WPA workers built 6

* Other buildings included 7,000 warehouses, 900 armories, and 2,700 firehouses.

* The WPA built a total of 40

* The WPA funded several subsidiary organizations like the National Youth Administration, Federal Music Project, and Federal Theater Project. 

* WPA workers built 67,000 miles of curb. 

* Additionally, 57,000 miles were paved with concrete or macadam. 

These statistics comprise a substantial majority of New Deal public works programs, the United States had the lowest rates of electrification of any industrialized country because of the relatively low population density in many rural areas.

1317175643.0,ktmr3,Why I Wouldn't Vote for Ron Paul,JesusChristFarted,75,36,207,"I'm sure this will get downvoted immediately but I wanted to outline why I won't ever vote for Paul in a general election

1. He's an ideologue. While there is a lot of evidence that small organizations working without an overweening government can foment creativity, not a reality, and while regulation can be both corrupt and inefficient, some regulation is needed to protect the powerless from the powerful (see women's/minorities'/children's/gays' rights). Without regulation, the average business will not spend money to accommodate the disabled, for example, because the cost of doing so will work counter to the profit motive. In a vacuum of federal power

2. He's naive. Forget the usual complaints that he's an isolationist. That's palatable to me. But he seems to believe that, inherently superior to federal laws. Why, he doesn't say. Paul would argue that ""the market"" would fix inefficiencies in unregulated corporations and powerful states but inefficiency and corruption are inherent in every single human enterprise since recorded history. We've already seen ""free markets"" in England, with less regulation than in the U.S., go to the dogs. 

3. He cherry picks. His vision of what the Founders wanted is, the founders of the country lived in a time when there was less need for a strong central government, but they abandoned the Articles of the Confederation and implemented a central bank, something Paul seems adamantly against if it happens to be the Fed. 

4. He ignores human nature. While Paul rightly denounce politicians telling you what you can buy, I think he is rightly cautious about government influence over citizens. On the other, individuals in a ""free market"" America will be just as likely to deceive their fellow citizens as they are now. They will do so in groups and these groups will act as companies and political organizations. A nuclear waster disposal company, for example, could simply dump its waste on its own property without sufficiently protecting citizens who live nearby. The business will do what's best for it alone since there is no recourse otherwise. Perhaps some states would step into the void left by a weak federal government and regulate (if so, why is their regulation better? Just because it's a state reg?) but perhaps others wouldn't. The people born in those states think of their homes like a commodity that they can easily replace by moving to another state. 

5. He forgets that society is inevitably about sharing. He espouses strong property rights, I might protect my home, but when Joe Smith &amp; Co. use the adjacent lot to pollute my home town worse than can be done today, my property has suddenly become worthless. 

6. He loves the profit motive. But there's no evidence that the profit motive can't get out of hand. Not everything works through a simple supply/demand ratio. If private companies own and maintain the federal highways I drive to work on and then decide to charge me huge tolls

7.  He's for turning back gains for the gay community

8. He's not a friend of the scientific community. The fact that he thinks global warming isn't a big problem is enough to demonstrate that he's a person who believes based on ""faith"" rather than evidence. As someone who has not spent years of his life studying the climate

9. His crusade against the Fed is misguided. I agree that there should be more transparency and oversight of the Fed

I could go on, but I won't vote for him. One criticism I have of the supporters I've talked to is that they don't really want to get into the weeds of why they are right or wrong (the conversation is more on the level of everything the federal gov does is wrong because it's inefficient, period) or they miss the forest for the trees by overly focusing one area where the federal government is definitely inefficient. I've felt like I'm talking to people who don't question their beliefs much. ",,False,,t5_2sfmf,,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ktmr3/why_i_wouldnt_vote_for_ron_paul/

Yes I know 4 people died and over 100 were injured. The nature of those injuries (causing so many people to require prosthetic limbs) is particularly tragic. Just let me finish. This is no disrespect to those who were injured or their friends and families. They have my donations

But Boston has always been a strong community, drunken sorority members wearing pink hats and liking Neil Diamond to represent the Red Fox fan base. We don't want a marketing team from national media dictating ""Boston Strong"" as a slogan for our region just as we don't want a marketing team from Larry Lucchino's pink hats saying that Manny Ramirez is their favorite current player on the Sox when in fact he is tearing it up in Taiwan.

We've always been an immigrant amalgamation of scrappy underdogs beating the hell out of each other - and banding together against outsiders in defense of our ""neighborhoods"" and communities and especially our sports teams! Adversity always binds people together (sad but true). We've always thrived on competition and rising above. I don't need some wrist band reminder of this because its part of our regional heritage.

The thing is

Ever since 9/11, I will remain loyal to the ideal that communities rally to almost any challenge. I just want what happened here to become a footnote within the worthy notable acts and reactions of Bostonians throughout our proud 380 years or more history. I refuse to be defined by it as a victim or marketing tool.

Horrific things occur to many good people around the globe. But those acts cannot define them. A raped person, but they can never be defined by that moment. When they assimilate that moment into themselves and it becomes another of dozens or hundreds of factors that help them define themselves as a whole human, that is what makes us rise above. When we get exposed to evil, learn from it and shape our reaction to it into just a facet of who we are, that is when we let a terrorist know they cannot win. That is why the ""Boston Strong"" movement needs to quell down. We are not defined by our reaction to these events. We were just that cool to begin with.

What if Dorner was so pissed off about this abuse, and he realized *nothing would ever be done about it* if business carried on as usual. He realized that the *only* way for LAPD abuse to enter public consciousness is to do something shocking enough to register on the media's radar. And as we all know, tragedy is the currency of our media. It runs on fear: of crime, terrorism, disease, etc. Dorner realized that he has two options: 1. accept being fired from the police force, or 2. go batshit crazy and start murdering some people

Perhaps there is an analogy with terrorism in the middle east as well. But my point is

Break out of the normal mode of thinking, you share some of the blame for the abuse. We are to blame because of our ignorance and lack of caring, and we should recognize that we essentially forced Dorner into this choice of murdering or letting the injustice continue.

X-Posted answer:

I liked your post. Shame you removed it. Repost it in PoliticalDiscussion for greater traction.

I know this has been said many times in many different ways but it bears repeating. In my opinion

The political/corporate hegemony has set up the current context we live in (sub-standard public education, maximization of debt service... and so on) to keep the masses just this side of subservience. The masses only appear lazy because they are so busy keeping their own lives from spiraling out of control. They are not lazy. They are gullible and being exploited by those whose sole purpose is to keep the inequality in place. Working 3 jobs to feed yourself and your family takes A LOT OF ENERGY. Making sure your kids gets picked up after school and dropped of at your sister's so you can wait tables at night squanders A LOT OF TIME. 

Those who struggle have a hard time to do anything other than keep struggling. It keeps the exploited exactly in their place. 

The whole ""how"" of fixing the busted system will be a real slog. Those we trusted to be competent have failed. Those we believed were benevolent were crooks. Ultimately it will likely take a combination of education (like talking to your family and friends), and support (lending a hand to the less fortunate).

Don't give up.

• It devalues the national popular vote; 

• It gives disproportionate influence to the relative handful of states where the statewide outcome is most uncertain (i.e. ""swing"" states).

• It discourages voter turnout;

A theory of the mechanics of the U.S. ‘propaganda system’ was outlined by Herman and Chomsky in their [propaganda model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model). The theory has its critics, and their ideas are still relevant today.

While propaganda is rarely discussed in reference to the U.S.

Below is a quote from Bernays' [Propaganda (1928)](http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf) - Lippmann’s thoughts on propaganda can be found in his book [Public Opinion (1922)](http://www.faculty.english.vt.edu/Collier/5314/lippmannpublicop.pdf):

&gt;In theory, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion about anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issues so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions.

On a related note

Lippmann continues:

&gt;These classifications would tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications made their reactions vocal. That is to say, and would then feel it more definitely.

Both Lippmann and Bernays essentially believed that propaganda is a glue that holds back the potential chaos of the masses and keeps a democratic society together in the absence of absolute leadership.

This leads to the question in the title of this post:

**Is it in a democratic society’s interest to be subjected to propaganda in order to bring about consensus regarding complex and potentially divisive issues?**

But there are two other questions I would like people to think about:

**1) Could the U.S. maintain a high standard of productivity without propaganda and with a highly-informed public?**

**2) How does the decentralization of media via the internet affect the realm of propaganda?**

Edit (1): fixed minor typos

Edit (2): To clarify, and it could be used to rally the public for war against Iran. My question related to propaganda is regarding cases when a person must diligently explore an issue before making an informed opinion.

The popular vote was won by less than 10% of the total number of eligible voters.

These numbers are insane. 
55% of Texans are minority. Every year you can add more or less a percentage point to that. Now of course

This option was abandoned due to [lack of support from conservatives](http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-16/politics/us.healthcare_1_public-option-insurance-option-health-care?_s=PM:POLITICS) and many thought healthcare reform was DOA at that point.

1376040130.0,1k0m4e,Are the recent (potentially NSA mediated) law enforcement operations against Freedom Press and Lavabit connected to Snowden?,Kasseev,55,19,14,"We know that Snowden is now in a Russian government controlled safe house


The recent pressure on Freedom Press and Lavabit seem to have originated simultaneously. The former was taken out by surprise last week by a combined technological and law enforcement attack. The latter was probably set in motion some short time ago

In addition it was clear that an older version of the Tor browser bundle was specifically attacked by the malware attack used against Freedom Hosting users, and the common thread is Snowden and the NSA.

Honestly this is all total speculation


I think the most likely explanation is one of 2 things:

1. The NSA and related authorities are taking out high value targets while they still have the power and political capital to do so before potential reforms kick in after the current congressional recess. However these moves don't seem high value enough to be honest, and there clearly needs to have been a justification for it all.

2. For some reason they are trying to cut off Snowden from those he is in contact with outside Russia. That or they have recently uncovered evidence that he uses Tormail and/or Lavabit and wish to uncover what exactly he has been telling people. I suspect they will have access to Tormail server data soon if not already as pressure on the CEO of Freedom Hosting mounts in Ireland.

2.5. Moving into the realm of crackpottery here but Snowden is now in an incredibly vulnerable position. He may not have a clear line of contact to any of the press anymore, surrounded by state operatives. The Wikileaks handler's situation is unknown as well. Greenwald revealed recently that he received tens of thousands of leaked documents but importantly, only he and Poitras were given access. There have been persistent rumors of a dead mans switch but nothing definitive, as far as I can recall it may have stemmed from Greenwald's assertion that Snowden had ""taken measures"" to protect himself. I think this whole sequence of events is ominous; it is the perfect moment for a transfer of Snowden to somewhere he won't be able to communicate to the public from, or where his actions will become involuntary. I'm not talking about a commando raid, more on the scale of a quiet prisoner transfer  to agents that operate outside the public eye.


Anyway this got too long

EDIT: Correction - Lavabit's CEO Levison said he was struggling with the decision for ""6 weeks"".

EDIT: should be ""Freedom Hosting""

If the US government mandated certain standards that have to be adopted by all retailers selling clothing, since that tends to increase the cost of doing business and thus incentivizes capital flight to countries with less regulations and lower standards; since the regulation is on the demand-side, and not the supply-side, companies won't be able to lower the standard of work below a certain level.

In terms of prices, if they raise the prices to preserve their profit margins on each item sold, they'll probably sell less, and thus lose out on the aggregate profit.

The most ironic part of the whole situation is that Truman was insisting on an unconditional surrender and the Japanese were worried about the emperor being tried as a war criminal. After Japan capitulated on Aug. 15

I've come to the conclusion that although the Japanese troops were portrayed (sometimes rightfully) as fanatical and suicidal

I believe the US had only built 2 working nukes after the [Trinity test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_test) and wanted to use them as soon as possible.

Is what was considered politically ""conservative"" in the 80s, considered middle of the road now?",jpcrecom,70,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1aj28j/has_the_us_actually_become_more_conservative_over/, that Obama's ""liberal"" policies now were formerly centrist positions.   I THINK it's a fairly common position

I feel it's something that I've seen/heard a good amount

In the last 30 years, it is ""liberal"" views becoming ""middle of the road"" (e..g, gay marriage, loosening of marijuana laws, debating the legality of abortion no longer being a legitimate issue.  I can't think of an issue that the country has become more conservative on socially in the last 30 years except maybe immigration (which probably isn't even a social issue anyway) as a result of all the post 9/11 hysteria and poor economy.

So, no - at least not when it comes to spending.  We have a trillion dollar deficit.  Government spending as a % of GDP was in the low 20s in the 70s and 80s and is up near 25-30% now [source](http://www.supportingevidence.com/Government/fed_budget_as_percent_GDP_over_time.html).  Taxes as a percent of of GDP, definitely declined from the 80s [source](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Tax_Receipts_as_a_Percentage_of_GDP_1945%E2%80%932015.jpg), but that could arguably be due to the recession(s) since you see it spike up during the 90s and down during the two chasms of the 2002 and 2008 recessions.  And when people make the statement that we are getting more conservative, I don't think they are exclusively talking about tax policy.

The government is certainly getting larger, while Obamacare is not a ""government takeover"" since it's moving people to private insurers, it's certainly government mandating behavior, thousands of new gun control laws).  Government is also becoming more authoritarian when it comes to wars, due process, surveillance,etc.

The intertwine between government and corporations is certainly increased - the ""crony capitalism"" that is all the rage

edit:  ""right/conservative"" does not mean ""Republican"".  ""Left/Liberal"" does not mean ""Democrat""  There are many things that Republicans are doing (e.g. unfunded wars resulting in massive deficits) that are not ""right wing"" polices and there are many things Democrats are doing that are not ""left/liberal"" policies.

1315184584.0,k4uty,"Traffic statistics for /PoliticalDiscussion, observations, and ideas for growth",slapchopsuey,42,75, there is no substitute for cold hard data covering the full range of the subject in  question. So what follows is a screencap of the traffic statistics page for /politicaldiscussion taken a few minutes ago

* **[The traffic statistics for /politicaldiscussion](http://i.imgur.com/Ioe9r.png)**. 

On the graphs, and 'subscriptions' are the number of readers who subscribed to this subreddit. 

Looking at uniques and impressions *per hour*, and several peaks and dips during the waking hours. Even at the quietest times of night, 25 people per hour are checking /politicaldiscussion.  In the busiest times, it's usually over 80 unique users per hour, often at or over 100 per hour. Keep in mind, these are not total users present at any time, but *new* users streaming in over the course of the day. For the total number of users every day

Looking at uniques and impressions *per day*, and a fluctuation over the weeks. It is very clear on these charts when /politicaldiscussion was linked and promoted in /politics; the numbers significantly increased. The best ways to promote growth in a subreddit are to have promotion in similar subreddits, and to get it linked in the sidebar (more on that below). In the past several weeks, the number of unique users checking out /politicaldiscussion are almost always over 1,000 *per day*. This number is generally higher than the number of people who actively participate, but these are redditors who are logged in, looking at the page. The average reader in /politicaldiscussion looks at 4.5 pages here per day. So while some have the perception that this subreddit is quiet, and considering the relatively low number of new submissions daily

For comparison, it has *fewer* unique readers per day, and they do only 1.4 pageviews on average. And that subreddit is at an average level of activity for its size, meaning this subreddit is performing above average in activity. 

Looking at the green 'subscriptions' chart, I'd like to subscribe here"" and click the button to add it to their frontpage. So to the community that is here, don't put too much stock in the gut feelings of a few vocal members; there are far more of you than they say there are, and a small but steady stream of newcomers every day. 

* Observations: 

There is discord among a vocal few here, but few if any that have at their core the idea of *political discussion* above all else. This isn't a soapbox on a stage before a crowd of a half million or more, it's more like a hole in the wall coffee shop or pub, the kind of place politically-interested people got together for hundreds of years to air their observations and ideas among other politically-interested people. It's not a place for rhetoric and propagandizing, that's what the soapbox on the stage before hundreds of thousands is for. It's a place for discussion, among a small crowd of people interested in and capable of discussion.

* Ideas for growth: 

But the detractors of /politicaldiscussion are correct that the crowd is very small and could stand to grow. Growth of a subreddit is not magical, or where memes flood everything, ask if people ever heard of /politicaldiscussion. Word of mouth. Getting /politicaldiscussion into the sidebars of other similar reddits is something the mods can and  should be doing. And finally, if you want people observing to join into political discussion, it helps to create an atmosphere where people want to join in. 

tl;dr - The traffic stats speak for themselves, and they're reading the submissions you all are posting. Participation has remained stable the past three weeks, with a small but steady stream of subscribers daily, yet it can stand to grow. Growth requires work, getting the word out. A subreddit is nothing but the sum of its members, and the cost of participation is zero, so if you want something that's not here, not /political*attention*, get the word out,

1. **There's only *one* job-creator: Demand.** A business will never invest or create more jobs if there is no demand.

2. **Recession = too little demand.** The ""uncertainty"" everyone keeps talking about is a result of too little spending by consumers. 

3. Help the economy by putting more money in the pockets of consumers

4. **Capital Gains taxes should be raised.** Investors don't need tax incentives to invest in a profitable deal.

5. **Simplify the tax code, and you still need tax breaks to be profitable, you're not a viable business.

6. **An investor class with too much money, then a crash. 

7. **Good regulations** protect consumers

8. In a recession, the government, can act as a counter-cyclical weight to goose demand during a recession. Hence, the **government should run surpluses during a boom, and run reasonable deficits during a recession.**

Can we make a basic Demand-Side philosophy part of the debate in this country? What does Reddit think?


Cheers

TLDR: Demand is the only job-creator. Lower taxes on consumers
