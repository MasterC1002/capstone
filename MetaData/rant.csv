For the past 3 months

If any of you are overweight (which I'm assuming is not out of the realm of possibility since this is the internet) I'm sure you have had your share of assholes that say the cruelest things.  

Two incidents come to mind for me-
One night I had just finished putting the groceries we bought in the trunk and continued to help my daughter get buckled in her car seat and for whatever reason, that they will give me a candy bar if I suck their dick.  I politely tell them to fuck off when they offer me two candy bars.
Humanity at its finest?

A more recent incident was while I was outside of the craft store waiting for my friend to get off work.  Again, who the hell needs a loud speaker on the outside of their truck) and in front of the entire strip mall of people feel the need to yell at me 'hey fat ass, why don't you eat another cream puff'.   For the record, I have no idea what a cream puff is, but I am sure it's delicious!  But I digress...

Now to the WTF part of the post (assuming anyone is still reading).
As I walked the lake last night, get in front of me, and ""Moooo"" yet again.  Naturally, I politely respond for them to suck my ass.
Now honestly

So yes

So for any of you who feel the need to hurt someone for no other reason than to make yourself feel better
Life is hard enough without people hurting other people.   And while I may be fat

1362763916.0,19x6sc,"No kids? Rarely if ever actually get to leave work near quitting time. Have kids? Better leave 10 minutes early every day to make daycare in time, and I'll need Wednesday off to volunteer at school!",Rando_Thoughtful,92,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/19x6sc/no_kids_rarely_if_ever_actually_get_to_leave_work/

I'm sure this has been ranted about a million times

I am a bachelor and have no kids. I work about 50-60 hours per week and it's frowned upon if I leave promptly at 5 pm, it always comes down on me to step in and fix things.

Most of my coworkers with kids, you see. Also, they get unlimited time off for dentist appointments, staying home if a kid has sniffles, early baseball practice, etc. It's no big deal if they have to skip a day of work with a week's notice or less to volunteer for whatever. Whether it's all PTO, I don't know, but it's still annoying.

To people with kids, but since they also chose to have kids they are relieved of the same burdens. And it's not like I can be rewarded especially for taking up their slack or they complain that they're being penalized for having kids. It really frustrates me that they don't see the extra 10-20 hours and extra weekend work I put in every week to cover their asses as a penalty to me.

As far as I'm concerned

I feel better now.

1368962291.0,1emjqb,My brother is facing 15 years to life in prison...,Zombrii,52,12,29,"Why does this make me rant? Several reasons. Let's start with an explanation. He was convicted of attempted rape. Of an under age girl. Lots of details but I will try and keep it short. They say he digitally penetrated her. Meaning with his finger. They did cotton swabs but never sent them to the state for testing. So there's no DNA evidence confirming he did. There was also no irritation. He works construction. His fingers are wide and calloused. There would have been irritation. There was also an issue of time. He wasn't alone in the house. So with all of this

Edit: He was convicted of actual rape. I was mistaken. Initially it was attempted rape I had thought. A little more info on the situation: The girl was 10. My niece was having a sleepover for her birthday. The girls were downstairs watching movies and this girl fell asleep, talking about ghosts shaking her. (They had been telling ghost stories earlier) He offered to take her home. Two hours later the cops were at the door accusing him. They called the parents of the other girls at the party, told them what was going on. So word got around fast to my nieces school. 

There are several things wrong in the investigation. Starting with the med exam, by him. When the girl described my brothers hand she said it was soft and hairy. My brother builds log homes. His hands are scarred and calloused and he has the beginnings of arthritis in the joints so they're inflamed. Edit* He also has no hair on his hands. Not even the knuckles.  His lawyer was a joke, never bothered to point out that her description was incorrect, never asked my brother to show the jury his hands. It took them two months to get the warrant to even arrest him for it. 

The other great thing about South Dakota is that in rape cases

THe sickening thing to me is that without proof...with just the word of a 10 year old girl he was convicted. A 10 year old girl who's testimony changed 3 times before the trial began. The system failed. Big time.

Take care of your bellmen, add extra hussle, get the desk to send up amenities or get them into a nicer room.

Notice I said 'asshole' cyclists, fuck the gasoline tax, but I'll save that for another rant. 

What I'm mad about is these fellow asshole bikers who think they own the road. In a college town like mine, which to me is just fine. Most streets around here have bike lanes. But I swear to Reddit, every time I hit a stop sign, some fucking biker flies right past me, not even looking for cars, causing everyone driving, biking or even fucking walking have a minor panic attack. There is no law here that says cyclists automatically have the right of way. None. These bikers even get to go to the front of the line due to the bike lane

But today was the worst. I was biking home from class on a fucking cold 17 degree day and encountered the same stoplight I do everyday. Like any good, because I didn't feel like getting killed. But then this privileged fuckwad with her 2012 Diamondback bike, which probably cost her daddy 3 grand flew past me in the bike lane (which is meant for one fucking vehicle like any lane on a road), and through the fucking red light with 4 cars coming at like 50mph, causing them all to stop, and causing one to run into another. This bitch didn't even look after hearing all the destruction, because apparently getting back to her apartment daddy paid for was more important than the 4 or more lives she just put at risk.

It's been 10 days. 10 fucking days and 30 meals that have passed, if i've had enough to eat, if i would like to have seconds. She'll even try to give me more food. I'll decline, of course... And when i tell her i'm full, or i eat a little less than i did the meal before, she'll say something like ""oh, being here with me is making your stomach smaller

I don't think i'm skinny, but it took me so long to finally become comfortable enough with how i look, and within the first 3 days of being here, she made me wish i could cheese grater myself.

She also doesn't want me to go out too often. She's told me i'm her favorite because i never go anywhere. Because i stay home all day...

Being Korean, and care more about what they look like. If they cared about health more than their looks, they wouldn't be so fucking obsessed with weight loss, because so many korean people are probably underweight. If they actually cared about anything else than what they looked like, makeup, clothes, shoes

I AM overweight. I know that. I realize that i'm too big for korean clothes, it's a problem. I get that i'm lazy and don't like exercising, and that's probably adding to it. I GET IT.

background info: up until the summer of 2012 my family and i have lived outside of the US in a poor country. my uncle's family however

i remember before i came to the US he would always send me nice gifts that my family couldn't afford for me and I was immeasurably grateful (this will come up later in the rant) so i had a pretty positive image of him. my parents would pass along to my brothers and I stories of how he's doing well in school and shit and how we should be motivated to work hard like him and his parents so we can live a nice life in the US when we grow up. After meeting him and actually getting to know him personally I realized just how shitty and worthless he really was. 

when we first came to the US you can imagine that we started with literally nothing

he humiliates my family

then it got worse. this stupid bitch just can't be satisfied. they have this big gorgeous house in a beautiful neighborhood (which you can imagine is like a million times better than the 1-bedroom apartment my family is living in

i could barely contain my rage at the car thing though. what sort of insufferable bastard calls a BMW a ""commoner car"" (where i live...seeing a BMW that isn't 20 years old is like a miracle) 

i dont give a shit if all his friends have a BMW and he wants something unique

he has no respect for anyone or anything. he is condescending and treats EVERYONE like crap. he talks shit about everyone and everything

i thought that hoping he'd grow up to be broke and lose the priveledge of having rich parents would make me feel better, he's actually smart in school and is already planning on going to medical school and everything (even tho he screams at his parents that he'll just quit school and give up on life if he doesn't get a new [insert expensive car here] from his mommy and daddy the moment he's accepted into med school)

 it's possible that he's going to die without ever having experienced the struggles of the everyman. that depresses me a LOT because I'm probably going to die without having experienced the luxuries he has. 

anyway im glad to get that out. i'd love to say this to his face but im sure he'd complain to his mommy and daddy like the bitch that he is

* Has no concept of money. Gets $500 from her parents every two weeks that doesn't cover school expenses, and yet somehow it takes her *weeks* to pay me her share of the utilites bill. God forbid she use some of her allowance money and let her parents pay her back later, no, no. They have to do it because she ""doesn't handle any of that stuff."" **SHE'S A BUSINESS ACCOUNTING MAJOR**


* She's astoundingly self-centered. One of my scholarships didn't come in like it was supposed to, plus some rolls and sides and tell her I'll pay- it's the least I can do for not chipping in on the grill. She disappears while I'm in the check out and when she reappears a minute later she *eating fried chicken*. ""Don't worry, Don't worry,"" she says. ""I'll still eat the stuff you're making. I was just starving and I had to eat."" She told me once she actually thinks she is starving to death when she is hungry. Like, could die at any moment. We get home, I keep asking, ""Are you sure you are still hungry,"" but she insists she's starving. I make ranch chicken and rolls and green beans and twice-baked potatoes. **She didn't eat a fucking bite.** Didn't even touch it.

* She's actually incredibly racist. Her dad grew up in South Carolina where his family used to be big plantation owners. They're still pretty bitter about that whole Emancipation Proclamation thing. It's not just black people though- its pretty much everyone. Around Christmas time we got a card in the mail addressed to the previous tennent. I found it in with the rest of the mail and jokingly said, yada yada, but she opens it anyways. It turns out to be a Hanukkah card with one of those $50 american express pre-paid cards in it. I tell her she can't keep it, but she just looks at the dradle on the front and yells ""Ha! I just stole from the Jews!"" I tell her again she can't keep it- look, I say, it's from her grandparents. She just says ""so?"" and walks out. **HER GRANDFATHER HAD JUST FUCKING DIED THAT WEEK**.

* She was engaged to a guy who lived back in our home town about 5 hours away. At one point, it's actually severe mono and he's got a 102 fever and a full body rash. She eventually called him and blew up. I could hear yelling and crying and then yelling. When it was over she comes *skipping* out her room and  ""He cried. I faked it. After we hung up I realized it was probably just because I was on my period anyway."" The next three days in a row he has flowers delivered to our house. The first time they came, she calls him and tells him they're ugly and she can't believe they're going to get married and he doesn't even know what kind of flowers she likes. The next two days in a row, 2 dozen long stem roses. After three days of this, she tells him it doesn't make up for him not coming to apologize in person. So this guy with his fever and his rash, gets in his car, drives 5 hours, and then has to turn around and drive home because he's going to try and make it back in to work the next day.

I would talk to the firemen about my degree an they would ask me ""why the heck would you be police instead of fire?"" Conversations later I decided that being a fireman is something I could really enjoy.

So I stopped smoking and signed up for the EMT - Basic course to get my Emergency Medical Technician certification (something you need for the fire department). 2 months later I started the course..

B. and I will be splitting up soon.  We’ve been together for the better part of 18 years.  Since I was like 23.  This comes as a devastating blow to me.  In fact, it came down to his commitment to you.  Yes, I know you were not in a sexual relationship with B. -- and therefore you can justifiably say that you’ve done nothing wrong -- but he has told me that his friendship with you, which is very deep and tender and based on both emotional and romantic attraction (his words, not mine), is not negotiable.  If my ultimatum to him was “it’s either M. or me,” he decided, then M.  Not you.”   Let me repeat that he has stated openly to me that he is very attracted to you in more ways than one.  I let you know this some months ago.  I am not a controlling spouse.  B. has had many female friends over the years that I have not had any problems with.  But perhaps you can understand why his attachment and commitment to you -- even if it never became sexual now or in the future -- would be overwhelmingly painful for me.   It would have been kind if you had willingly subtracted yourself from our relationship.  But I wanted it to be voluntary.  I did not want to demand it.  I have tried to be good to you in the past.  I just wanted you to do me a good turn as well.  From your heart.

You are perfectly justified in saying “I’ve done nothing wrong.”  Especially since your hang-out time with B. has diminished a lot over the last few months.  But I did let you know about the terrible tension this arrangement was creating in our marriage.  Your having nearly daily contact with him was just the death knell I think. But the absolute final blow was when he secretively paid for your car repairs, B.  Not exclusively, but primarily.  It would just have been an act of generosity and kindness if you could have helped us maintain our relationship which has meant a very great deal to B. -- and absolutely everything to me.

I have asked B. that during our separation (before our actual divorce), yes.  I hope you will help him to honor this

I am a 3rd year University Jazz student so music is ALL that I do so I love the work. Getting paid big bucks to play music (in suits too)? It's a DREAM but also A LOT of work. Especially since I practice upwards of 3 hours a day to keep on top of my craft.

People will call into the agency and request a band where they have a database of musicians which are selected, requested cover songs (or purely Jazz sets) and the pay. After that I can accept or decline if I have something else on and then it will just be passed onto another musician. So here are some things that make me rage.

**Requests during a set:** We prepare our sets in advance since its upwards of 45 covers to remember for a single night and there are NO rehearsals. You find the recordings according to what the lead singers set list is and nail it to the original recording

It's common for people to request a song mid set, wedding I did last night...), it's fucking horse shit. How the hell can a live band of 3 vocals, guitar, keys, bass, drums and sax gonna pull that off on the fly? He yelled this shit out after 3 songs in a row and it makes us look stupid. Fuck that guy and his shit. 3 months ago it was Gangnam Style that was always yelled at us.

**Not getting fed:** Seems like small potatoes but playing music for a total of 3 hours with around 2.5 hours of speeches and toast's in-between is fucking exhausting! Especially if we are set up outside in the sun (because it looks nicer and we want our wedding to look nice so play in the sun.) We aren't an iPod where you plug it in and forget with no maintenance then when it's over turn it off. If thats what you want then just do that!

**Being ignored until the very last song:** We don't expect people to be listening like your at an actual concert

We have been here 3 for hours and NOW you want us to play music? I'm not kidding when I say one time we got booed because we played our last song (at 11:30pm!!

**People wanting to play our instruments:** I'm a drummer

**No loading zones:** Seriously, alone it takes 3-4 trips. One time I had to walk all of it through OTHER hotel loading zones 250 metres away because the actual venue doesn't have any. THEN I have to try and park my car some where and if thats in the middle of the city then I am fucked. Guests can bus in and out easily but just give the band somewhere to park!! After playing for 3 hours and dealing with drunks the last thing I want to do is walk 1 kilometre to my car, compete with traffic to get back to the OTHER HOTEL LOADING ZONE to load up 250 METRES AWAY and then leave.

Everyday I see these girls who have babies/kids and are 16, sleep, money, or fun. All of these people comment on how 'proud' they are of their strength and how sorry they are that they have it so rough. I talk about my stress of going to college full time and being poor cause everyone knows college isn't cheap, and people act as if 'You have no right to complain.' So the girl who failed to have safe sex time and time again and pops out kids when she has stated she is dirt poor and can't afford to even pay the bills, so she lives off of the government while serial dating every Tom, Dick, usually having a kid with one or all of them

I'm in college trying to work towards a career that I know will allow me to live a comfortable life and take care of my future family (I do not have kids nor am I married, been poor before the birth of child number 1, married at 19 to a guy she already knew was worthless, divorced within the year, got with fellow number 2 and had 'casual' unsafe sex even though she knew he was on drugs and a criminal, ends up pregnant with twins, gets with another guy while pregnant, has the twins then 2 months later gets pregnant again (NOTE: Neither him nor her have a job.) Decide they love eachother so much they need to get married even though he is only 19...Gets married to guy 3 while pregnant, then he's the best husband she could ever ask for; continues to whine cause she is tired and so poor

Oh look at MidnightOfcourse bragging about how she is in college working her ass off trying to get on the Deans List and get her Bachelors Degree

Is this honestly where the standards lie now days? You have to get knocked up before the age of 18 to get a ""So proud of you!""??? 
What I do isn't easy, so yes, sometimes when I'm working so hard that I forget the day or month, I become agitated and tell a few people that I'm running out of energy. Also I never get 'OMG You are so strong!' 'So friggin proud omgz!' 'You can do this, youre a strong woman girl!' like these whiney teen/young moms who should be the best mom they can be without a crowd giving them reassurance, but I still keep going to college everyday, keep doing the work, and working hard for good grades.

He controlled all of our money; took all of our paychecks (my mom's as well) and had his name on everyone's accounts. He made a tremendous amount of money each year and he used it as one more form of abuse and control. The man makes ~300

When I left home several years ago I told him I was done talking to him  unless he could admit, and change the shitty behaviors he had that ruined our family and my childhood and of course I have never once heard an apology.

1370988865.0,1g5jr2,Dear Idiots in Movie theaters: SHUT UP.,Planeis,27,4,29,"Bottom Line: Why are idiot teenagers talking throughout an entire movie

I’ve been wanting to see Fast and the Furios 6, I felt somewhat confident that the raucous crowds that can sometimes happen on a hotly anticipated new release would be gone.

We arrived at the theater characteristically short on time, again, I figured this was Fast 6’s 3rd weekend, no big deal. Got tickets, went into the theater. It was pretty full, but we had no problem getting a seat.

I noticed a large group of teenagers that appeared to be between 15-19 come in, its to be expected in a crowded theater that previews will generate talking like “that looks good/bad”. BTW, the previews were AWFUL. What the hell were the makers of R.I.P.D. thinking?!

Anyway, laughing loud. I tense up, breathe out, assume it’ll stop after a few minutes. Eight months ago I had a somewhat similar experience seeing the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall, two guys next to me were talking throughout the first 30 minutes of the movie. I’m not even concerned with whispering, whispering in the ear of the person next to you is not a big deal. These two teenaged guys were just flat out talking. Finally, I turned to them and yelled “Shut the FUCK up

So anyway, not even about the movie, making jokes, laughing at themselves. I looked at them and two guys are standing up in the aisle and leaning on the handrail, with their feet up on their friends’ seats. What the fuck. Someone says to them “hey, can you be quiet please?” Their response, laughter, hand slapping. They don’t stop.

Twenty five minutes in a lady behind me looks at them and says “Really guys… really? C’mon” They laugh more. This just keeps going. For a few minutes here and there they do stop and I think “whew.. finally.” But they always started back up. The pleas for them to shut up continue

Why are they doing this?! What the fuck do they get out of this? If you want to talk to your friends

I glance at them a few times when they are being particularly loud, calling, showing each other things. What the fuck. Stop it. Just leave the movie, god damn.

Finally, or at least the loud ones did. Not sure what did it. I think maybe one of the women in their group was getting embarrassed or perhaps someone made them think they’d call the cops. Man, was it nice when they left.

We left the theater and I see this same group of kids sitting right outside in the hall and thats when it occurs to me. These kids probably didn’t even pay for this movie. They paid to get in, I surmised that they paid to get into a showing maybe much earlier when their parents’ outdoor music festival started, and have just been theater hopping ever since.

If you’re gonna theater hop and see movies for free. Fine. But what the fuck is you’re problem that you have to be so loud that numerous people for two hours tell you to be quiet? And why do you have no shame regarding this? If I was talking to a friend in a movie and someone asked me to be quiet

Bottom Line: Teenagers and/or other idiots. Shut up during movies. No one wants to hear you talk. NO ONE. Whatever it is your talking about is completely unnecessary. Nobody wants to hear you laughing at your own stupid jokes. SHUT THE FUCK UP

What's really starting to bother me, the people who are too warm tend to get to call the shots, temperature-wise. I work in an office building with rented offices, and it's ALWAYS freezing in here. Today, it's colder inside than outside, and it's only 58 degrees F outside. My boss and I have a space heater running in our office just to keep warm. 

One of the things that frustrates me about this is I feel like a lot of the time, I have no problem with overweight people. I don't think that because someone is bigger it automatically means they're less healthy than someone smaller. I don't think that people who are overweight are ugly or necessarily need to change themselves. BUT if someone's always hot because they're overweight, they shouldn't be able to dictate the temperature for everyone else in the area (which is what happens in my office building). If it's that much of a problem for them, then yeah, maybe they should focus on losing weight instead of making all the smaller people around them comfortable by turning the temperature way down.

The same damn thing happens when I hang out with friends. I'll be at a nice, and I'll immediately be freezing. But when I'm too cold, no one caters to me. I'm expected to put on a sweater and suck it up.

There are people younger than me that claim to be 90s kids. They say they remember watching all these old shows on Nick and Cartoon Network and even the Simpsons. Guess what

They also say they remember stuff like reading rainbow and magic school bus. There weren't any new learning cartoons for a while so they had to use those up until 200X. They didn't JUST play those in the 90s.

They also claim they played stuff on original gameboy

And all of the candies and toys that were thought of in the 90s were eaten and played with by them. Candy and toys  end to last a while until production stops. I used to play with Rubik's cube and etch a sketches

1364411625.0,1b4li6,Apparently I'm a homophobe.,DaveTheRoper,29,5,17,"I got a message on Facebook this morning from a clearly irate ""friend."" She - and I shit you not - angrily demanded that I change my profile pic to the red Equality symbol to show my support for gay marriage. She went on and on about the importance of civil rights and blah blah blah, calling me a homophobe and a bigot.

I am a Libertarian, and it's nobody's business but theirs what they do in their private lives. I fail to see, however, how my refusal to *publicly* show support for gay marriage constitutes homophobia. The reason I'm not changing my profile pic is because **I do not want to get involved in the partisan debate.** I don't want to get into arguments, and I especially don't want to listen to the fuming vitriol coming from both sides of the issue. I just want to let the Supreme Court do its work, and when the time comes I will let my votes speak for me. Demanding that I publicly identify as a proponent of gay marriage (though a proponent I may be) for fear of being called a homophobe borders on McCarthyism and Stalinism. Right now I am preparing to ""come out"" as a person with Asperger's syndrome for Autism Awareness month, and I know I will face my fair share of stigma for that reason alone. I would rather not compound it with the controversy surrounding my support for gay rights.

tl;dr: Got called a homophobe for not showing support for gay rights. I support gay rights

1. The customer isn't always right.  In fact

2. If you want your low-cut top to get you free drinks

3. I worked in only one bar where a birthday could get you free drinks.  It had to be your 21st birthday, and only you could come get them.

4. If I'm swamped

5. If you say ""Surprise me""  I'm either dumping the bar mat or pouring you a fifteen dollar drink.  Depends on your tits.

6. I can describe the face of anyone who came in twice or more without tipping.  I can also describe the face of any regular good tipper.

7. I can refuse to serve you for any reason other than race/ethnicity/culture/religion/gender.  I can refuse to serve you just because you cause trouble every time you come in even if you haven't caused trouble yet tonight.

8. No you do not know the owner.  If you did

9. I don't care where you saw the bottle or what you think a drink should cost.  If I tell you it's a premium, computer.  That's a well drink.""

10. No valid ID

11. Read your airline vouchers before ordering a bunch of drinks.  No I cannot change the order to reflect two orders of chicken wings because it 'costs the same' and only food was covered by your coupon.  At the end of the night

12. ""What's good?"" is a question you ask when I have time to discern your damn preferences.  You and I both know I am capable of serving you a drink that I think is good and you might hate.  Leave me with nothing to go on

13. Too much ice, doesn't taste right, blah blah blah.  Fuck off.  You got the same drink everyone gets when they order what you ordered.

14.  You think I don't see you.  I don't.  I see drinks on the bar.  If there's a fleshy bag at one end of the bar with no drink in front of them

15. I have a system for working my way up and down the bar.  Sometimes people know the system and position themselves strategically.  They might get served before you.  Sometimes they even do it by accident.  You were not so fortunate.  It's not personal unless you can think of a logical reason that it might be.

16.  Your five dollars isn't any more valuable to me than someone else's five dollars.  ""I pay good money"" does not make me think your cash is sprinkled with wish-dust.

17.  I decide when you've had too many.  Not you.  I'm *required* to make this decision for you.

18.  Get in a fight, and come back in once you are calm.  I'll give you a napkin full of ice for your face.  You might even get me to pour you a free drink depending on the circumstances.  Seen it, done it.

It's difficult to describe to someone what it was like because most people have never experienced such a thing. Most people can relate to someone who say, some clothes, a hot shower and warm meal. Those things are still provided for a family who lost a home in a fire. The difference here is, everyone lost everything. There were no homes left to go to. No family was without need. For hundreds of miles there was nobody to turn to.

Small background info for sake of the story: I've never been on any type of government assistance before in my life.

The storm took my home and my job. I applied for assistance. 10 months later I received my first bit of assistance

The entire year I spent with horrible migraines and sinus infection/ear infections. Doctor visit after doctor visit, I was livid.

* He communicates with the people in the room next to us be yelling through the wall. (he's friends with them and communicates like this while they are playing LoL)
* He sets his alarm to 0530 and continually hits the snooze button until 0640 when he actually rolls out of bed. I asked him why he sets it so early and he responded by saying ""it helps me wake up""
* He plays shit on his laptop without using his headphones because he says there is something wrong with the headphone jack. MOTHER FUCKER YOU CAN BUY AN ADAPTER FOR THE USB TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT! Even when he's on his phone he doesn't use headphones unless he is on a phone call he doesn't want me to hear. Stupid and annoying youtube vids are SOOOO FUCKIN FINE to play outloud.

* He says hello every time he comes back into the room. Not just a regular 'sup'. Its ""HEY BUUUDDDY"". Its like I see him all day at work and stay with him in the same space. No need for the repeated greeting. And especially one like that.

1372891711.0,1hljmf,Staying at my bf's Parents house. IT IS DRIVING ME F-ING NUTS,turtlegir,27,4,23,"Currently my boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house. He is in the process of getting accepted to a job further upstate but we are waiting for his security clearance to go through. The company said it could take up to 2 months. So we are staying with his parents per their request until the job comes through. It is driving me nuts. They are really nice people but they are so opposite of how I was raised. I shall give examples

1. They are messy, and toe nails in the middle of the living room. I can't remember the last time they vacuumed the living room. Its awful. On top of that my bfs mother has barely any hygiene. She leaves a mess everywhere she goes and doesn't clean it up. She is highly over weight and blames it on everything other than her sheer laziness. All she does is sleep or sit in her chair. When she uses the bathroom she ends up pissing on the seat and it ends up going onto the removable carpet that's under the toilet, and does she take it up to clean it. NOPE! It stay's there for several days to approx 2 weeks and she doesn't wash it. It wreaks in there. It smells awful, and rather than actually cleaning the bathroom they put one of those plug in oil burners in the bathroom WHICH DOESN'T WORK! The kitchen is an absolute mess majority of the time and its because of her. SHE REFUSES TO CLEAN! (Warning: Bit of political incorrectness here but deal with it) I was raised in an old fashioned house (so shoot me) where the man doesn't do all the cleaning, the women ESPECIALLY IF SHE ISN'T WORKING cleans the house and makes it presentable for her husband and guests when they come home or visit. NOPE! Her husband has to clean everything and then she has the audacity to say ""You know I do that differently when I clean"" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME SHE NEVER CLEANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and when she does it's half-assed and still needs to be re-cleaned. She huff and puffs when dishes aren't done when she needs something. ARE YOU KIDDING YOU HAVE HANDS CLEAN IT YOURSELF! Her birth son like I said is just the same way.

2. Their table manners are like those of savages who haven't eaten in several months. They have both elbows on the table, talk with mouth full, cough with mouth full with out covering face, and smack their lips all the time. His mom gets food all over herself. Its really bad, and then she looks at me as if I fucked something up when I forget to grab a napkin. They set the table and when they do they fondle the fork and knives, the parts that go in your food and in your mouth. Disgusting! I seriously have to look down at my plate so that I don't flip my shit from the nightmare that goes on. 

3. Their son is a selfish fucking pain in the ass. I was raised where if you fucked up you knew it and you always heard about it. Nope if their son fucks up his mom is right there defending him. He stood litterally right outside of the bathroom when I was peeing waiting for me to get out

4. Their shopping is the next worse thing. THEY HAVE NO SHOPPING ETHIC. They bitch about having no money but they go out, no food, and only a few pieces of bread or a hot dog to hold me. You don't know the meaning of ""Starving"". What they should do is have him buy his own food, then he will know just how much of a bitch it is to pay for his ass and might not give his parent's so much attitude when they tell him he can't have anymore, or to save some for someone else. He won't do it though bc he is too fucking cheap. The car that his ass is in all day while working he refuses to put gas in. His parent's have too or else it won't get filled. He bitches about putting only $20 in. HEY THAT'S LIFE KID GET USED TO IT, NO ONE IS GOING TO PAY YOUR WAY! 

Rant is done for now. I'm sure I'll post again soon bc of the next fucking thing they did.

TL;DR   I fucking hate living with my bf's parents. I am grateful for their help and allowing us to stay with them but fuck it

How they were quite advanced for the time as far as social settings, very obvious indications of the overtly sexual ways of society. The article made it sound like it was so shocking that they were so sexual yet so socially advanced.

This got me thinking &amp; honestly

Think about it, how they should or should not present things or themselves to others, etc, society as a whole would be far more productive. Language, dress, products, advertising, entertainment, nobody would even look twice when they were on TV or if a woman went topless walking down the street (just like men do!). If it was socially acceptable for a person to admit aloud in public that they are most sexually attracted to [insert fetish here] more people could be less ashamed of themselves for various aspects of their body, obvious to all

Cursing is becoming more &amp; more socially acceptable all the time...but it's still censored for public broadcast. Even dumb words that aren't curse words are censored now. How stupid is it that society is so stuck-up that we have to censor words like 'gun', but honestly if you've tuned into a rap station you already know half the songs are going to be about  Nines and bustin' caps or whatever...if you're child is in the car then buy a damn nursery rhyme CD if you're so worried about their sensitive ears. Little girls singing about ""All I wanna do is rock your body"" is just as bad as them singing bad words...and why do we have to censor language for kids anyway? If this was another age-appropriate societal norm then it wouldn't matter! After a few years of removing censorship, this would all be normal and nobody would care anymore. If you want to censor everyone &amp; everything because you don't want to explain to your kid that things are normal and okay but only once they're old enough then that says more about you &amp; your parenting skills than it does about society. And as for offending people, if these things were normal &amp; acceptable then they wouldn't be offensive anymore! It's all in the way people take things. I live in a highly religious community and saying ""Oh my God"" in public is the same as ""Oh my holy fucking child-molesting Christ is a nigger fag ass shit!"" because the society is offended by the word ""God"" in a non-religious context. Short-shorts or a sleeveless top are as scandalous as having your genitals exposed. It's all just bullshit...we've hit a plateau as far as societal growth because people are offended by so much.

**The Floater**

Not a reference to that damn BM that just won’t flush

**Modus Operandi**

Will prop up at the bar and order a beer, they will sidle up next to them and join their conversation whether they want to talk to him or not. Generally this lasts for 10 minutes or so until the group excuse themselves and either walk out the bar, or move somewhere else. 

**Why they piss me off**

They drive away patrons. And unless said patrons complain to staff or security, well, sparks will fly. 

**How to deal with them**

If you are a fellow patron, old fashioned tap on the shoulder and a quick “Sit down and shut the fuck up” speech.

Speaking of Alpha’s…

**The Alpha**

Good segue! Good segue. We all know an Alpha, hulking musculature crammed into an Ed Hardy or UFC shirt. *shudders*

**Modus Operandi**

Usually grouped with a few friends, followed by the obligatory scotch and coke. Then more shots, most likely a few Jäger Bombs thrown in for good measure…. 

**Why they piss me off**

…Then someone bumps into them, shoulders back, ass puckered. If you look remotely male, you’re a target. Butch female, still a target. Then the violence ensues without logic or reason. 

**How to deal with them**

Patrons, EXACTLY like an angry dog. Staff, if you have worked in a bar for a while you can see the Alpha coming a mile away. Give the Manager and Security the heads up. And Security, find the first excuse you can to get these cock juggling chucklefucks out of the bar. Knock ‘em back at the door; minor sparks outside will prevent a major explosion inside.

**The Shrieker**

No general description here

**Modus Operandi**

They could be anyone, than someone decides they don’t have an inside voice. It might just start with a boisterous laugh, but over time and multiple alcahmaholic beverages the Shrieker’s voice ascends to somewhere between a dog whistle and the chorus from ‘I believe in a thing called Love’ by The Darkness.

**Why they piss me off**

Sheer irritation. They annoy the living hell outta me. There is nothing that destroys the atmosphere of a good night out then someone screaming like a banshee whose foot was run over by a 4WD
Seriously, at a higher pitch than usual, at a volume that is reminiscent of a 50’s ‘Scream Queen’ and follow it up with an Eddie Murphy-esque laugh: 

*‘Oh my god

Yeh. Cringeworthy. Don’t lie.

**How to deal with them**

Patrons, and an elbow to the throat respectively.

**The Denier**

Again, and it shits me to tears.

**Modus Operandi**

Gets munted beyond belief, gold is pretty awesome, but to describe it as good is pretty underwhelming really.)*
Anyway, but not before the share a puzzled look with their friend not unlike you just spoke to them in another language entirely. Hospitality Staff, you know that look. For non-hospo crew, think that bird from the Twilight movies.

**Why they piss me off**

Reasoning doesn’t work. Logic doesn’t work. Words with more than two syllables doesn’t work. You could explain the situation to them as if they were a six year old, you start to move them on and they play innocent dumb-arse, exclaiming ‘What have I done wrong?!?’ Like I haven’t just spent 10 minutes DRAWING YOU A FUCKING PICTURE CHIEF? 

**How to deal with them**

Get a black pen

**The Suit**

Full disclosure time; I have been this a few times. Justified at the time mind you, or a dude in a Dimmey’s $99 special. Regardless, it’s the air of superiority they give off that is the REAL giveaway.

**Modus Operandi**
     
Top shelf with all the trimmings. Scotch AND coke? Pfft, have that certain mien about them. And lo, do not try to tell them that the are intoxicated good sir, because their imaginary monocles will pop with your sheer audacity of speaking to someone above your station! They will give valid (to them) reasons of why you should be leaving them be, and various offhand threats to your job and the venue if you don’t dance to their tune. 

**Why they piss me off**

I’ll admit; I’m a bogan. An ejumacated one, and have spiels lined up to counter it. So when some pre-law 20 something starts telling me how to do MY JOB, I will verbally *OWN THEM*. Which brings me to my afore mentioned example; 
     
About 6 years ago at the age of 25 I was carded at the door at a bar I regularly drink at, its important. Producing my security licence, he refused it, stating that it wasn’t a valid ID (which is technically accurate) and denied me entry. 
     
I gave him the Denier look, I stepped back in and stated to him that yes, my ID wasn’t acceptable under Victorian law, but that it was valid in the sense of 59a of the Criminals Act, which is ONE reason we check ID on doors in the first place. 
I then asked him to check his phone. He done so with trepidation

Y’see

Not my proudest moment

**How to deal with them**

Quick on your feet and mind your p’s and q’s, then toss ‘em out for being quarrelsome.

**The Unseen**

The Unseen is living proof that some people shouldn’t go out in public without some form of supervision and a helmet. How else could you explain the shit they think they can get a way with?

**Modus Operandi**

The Unseen firmly believe that they are invisible to anyone that’s watching. Tries to pour themselves drinks from over the bar. Jumps up on chairs and tables. Throws ice around a crowded dance floor. Basically they do what ever they want

**Why they piss me off**

Sheer. Fucking. Arrogance. Who in Zod’s name (KNEEL BEFORE ZOD) gives you the notion that walking around a bar with your cock out is a good idea? And one of my pet peeves is one that the Unseen excel at; shagging in a toilet. Really? You’re THAT desperate to plant one

Buy a six pack of Carlton Draught/PBR and get a hotel room you filthy

**How to deal with them**

As harshly as fucking possible

In the four years we've been split up, and I mean, I have never once told him no, any time he wants her, I drive her an hour round-trip. This is never on any consistent basis, and it usually involves me emailing him to remind him to spend time with her. She absolutely adores him, and I'm not taking him away from her. 

He took her last night, and lives there as well. I've only been invited into the apartment a few times, and we always meet at the office. Usually, he is dressed and ready for work. Today, he was in pajamas. 

So, he had to hand her back over at 9am, for whatever reason. I probably wouldn't be pissed, but I'm sick today, and instead of lying in bed recuperating, I've got to handle running a household by myself, while working from home with a five-year old running around. I'm so mad right now I can't see straight. 

We always hear horror stories about the moms that won't let the dad see the kids. I'm not that mother. If I want her to grow up happy and well-adjusted

But what the hell can I do when he never wants time with her? Her birthday party is this weekend, I never mention the past. I stick to the topic of our daughter, and nothing else. 

He pays a ridiculously low amount of child support, and he have great health insurance for her, which is something I wouldn't be able to do on my own.

I honestly do not... do not understand the logic.

Work for years to get to the top of the corporate ladder so you can wear the fancy suits and glasses

wear the cool clothes walk the walk talk the talk... 

then go to a restaurant and act like a COMPLETE slob.... Like you don't know how to eat properly without getting food everywhere.

I know I work at a restaurant, and I remind myself that adults, grown men and women, businesspeople, professionals...

those are the people I serve. Not children! Not people with disabilities who might not be able to control the mess they make. Professionals. Grown

Somehow my opinion doesn't matter because my paychecks are smaller.

1. We don't know yet if he is guilty of these charges put up against him. He could be guilty, but why shoot him. He was surrounded, and being in the military is know there are ways to take someone without having to use lethal force.

2. If he does die

I realize that your wedding day is the most important day of your life and I'd never do anything to take that away from you. You had your wonderful moment to shine and that's great. And then there was the aftermath...

Apparently it doesn't matter that I went to considerable time and expense to attend your wedding, spent an entire day devoted entirely to you, attended your gift opening, and even gave you and your new husband a nice cash gift when I was a minimum wage retail slave with limited funds. 

Did I get a thank-you or even a ""we're so glad you could share our day""? NO. What I got was a nasty fucking letter that told me to remove all references to your wedding from my Facebook page. Apparently you don't want anyone posting non-professional photos of your wedding online since you spent so much on your precious fucking photographer. 

I had no intention of trying to upstage the pro or steal attention away from you. I just wanted to share with Facebook friends

I hope you felt really good about behaving like a raging hosebeast. Now that your special day is over all you have to look forward to is being a housewife and slave to two kids.

I'm glad I broke up with you. I'm glad I am not with you. I am glad we are not in a relationship. **I am fucking glad I am not with you.** I can't say that to your face, and your fucking best friend probably all blaming me for it. Side note: if you do fucking kill yourself because we aren't together anymore, you're more of a fucking coward than I originally thought. God, I am just so happy to be out of that relationship with you. You're a fucking tool, your logic about some things is just so fucking stupid, you're one of the most insecure men I have ever been with in my life, and you're the biggest fucking hypocrite ever. Did you make me happy? Yes, I shouldn't have even bought a home with you. I realize this now, nagged you to do the dishes because I fucking work 40 hours a week and go to college full time, HONESTLY. I don't give a flying fuck if you didn't ""get to have a childhood

Also, I broke up with you because I didn't love you anymore. I was getting bored. You were romantically dedicated to me and i wasn't you. That's not fair. I had to end it. But I'll tell you what: I didn't break up with you ""conveniently"" right before my 21st birthday and my trip to go see Bassnectar just to ""have fun."" No. I broke up with you to be with the person I am still, completely and totally, in love with. I broke up with you, to be with the person I was always meant to be with. I broke up with you to be with a man who actually gives me what I need, in every aspect of the term. I don't have the energy to type out all the ways he is better than you, but trust me. He is a fucking gift from God. That I am sure of. 

Also, FUCKING ALWAYS, I have to be on top or no sex. FUCKING LAZY ASS, ARE YOU SERIOUS. God, that sounds so terrible when I write it out. You were literally so lazy that you wouldn't even have sex with me unless I got on top. Fucking lame. Also, D has a bigger dick than you. Much bigger, much better. He always had the best dick, or what taking a shower in general means.

Yes. D moved in after you moved out. I'll admit it here. You already know in the back of your mind though that someone else in my bed with me now, I pay for the rent, I pay for the bills. All your shit is out of the house and I even paid for the bed me and D are sleeping on. So fuck you and your bullshit. Your little freakout on Facebook about D being in the house cracked my shit up, really. You were ranting and raving about what a whore I was because I had a man over after you moved out... and you only found that out because you saw the picture of the blunt I posted on Instagram... and you know I can't roll a blunt to save my life. You're fucking pathetic. 

I really hope you grow the fuck up. I don't want to be with you, and we are moving forward from this point on. I love D, with all my heart, and I never stopped loving him.

If I was to claim for myself she wants £80 a week off me. Well you can lie down on the fucking kitchen floor

Not to mention she is monumentally lazy and I honestly think she is mentally not all there. Since I'm at college all day sometimes one of her children might ask her to do a small menial task.

You might say, this may be true, but many composition/English/writing-instensive subject X professors send their students to me as a REQUIREMENT. So, from many classes, I am receiving a pretty accurate sample of the student body. But this also begs another question: why are TEACHERS sending their students to get their papers fixed by me before they read them? I do not have a teaching degree; I am not qualified to fill in the 14 year's worth of composition instruction that these students apparently missed. I understand these teachers feel the same way; they are teaching at the college level for fuck's sake...why should THEY be expected to fill in that same gap? It's much easier to just pass on the responsibility to the free writing resources on campus.

Anyway, verb, and complete thought together. I read four-page papers that are ONE SENTENCE, no paragraphs and no punctuation. I would say 75% of my students claim to have never been taught what a thesis statement is, the backbone of any good paper, nevermind topic sentences, body paragraphs, and conclusions. And I won't even go into the content of these papers: the ideas

Obviously, but HOW THE HELL were these students permitted to leave 4th grade? Is our education system so fucked up that illiteracy is sufficient for graduating high school?

Even more depressing is thinking about the ESL (English as a Second Language) students I see here. They make up a pretty large percentage of my students; I probably interact with ten of them per day on average. These are a group of people who have been learning English for maybe a year

But the way he acted after seemed like it should be something I should automatically know and its basic stuff and im an idiot (I was having a lot of anxiety at the time so I may be over exaggerating a smidge). 

So after the interview I get bummed. Real bummed. I dont know how much you know about nerds but we take pride in our knowlege and I felt like a moron who knew little about computers. I decided to look up this classification of processors to at least know about it next time, I like to learn.

Hollister. Why? Why do they exist? Who shops there and why do you shop there?

My son has decided Hollister is everything brilliant because his friends also wear Hollister.

Lets start with the price of the goods. Extortionate would be the term. Nike wish they could get away with such prices. £12 for a small can of deodorant. Really? I can get 12 cans of Lynx for that.

And what about the staff. Staff in Hollister aren't hired based on ability. They are hired based on their looks. Ability is a distant 2nd.

So let me go through the Hollister experience.

You walk through a door into what is essentially the darkest room ever (saves on lightbulbs I suppose).

Anyone who has ever watched Charlie Brooker's tv show ""Nathan Barley"" will now appreciate it when I use the term ""Rise of the idiots"". Basically the place is full of clones. I am not talking the staff

The customers must be wearing Plankton style helmets (Spongebob movie) otherwise there is no sense unless it is the overwhelming perfume smell that causes everyone to want to buy Hollister.

Maybe the smell is some mind altering drug that makes anyone of a certain age or intelligence instantly addicted to buying their overpriced clothes.

The people must be buying the clothes based on feel alone because there is no way you can see them in that light.

The other thing that hits you is the wall to wall noise. Now if I am at a concert I would expect to hear noise at this level but in a shop it helps if I can actually talk to the staff or even my wife so that we can decide to get the hell out.

Now because you can't find what you are looking for (it really is impossible unless you have nightvision goggles) you have to ask a member of staff for help. You may as well ask my 5 year old daughter because her method of looking for anything is to turn her head to the left

The staff are clearly there for looks and not for their skills of hide and seek or looking for a needle in a haystack.

Hey here is an idea ""turn the fucking lights on"" and just so that you can hear what I am asking without me having to mime to you ""turn the music down"" and so that I don't feel like vomitting ""calm it with the perfume"" and finally ""hire staff based on ability

I got nothing against any of the bands playing at Sasquatch, maybe you wouldn't enjoy it. Not enough robot squirrel transformer battle music for you."" 

Sigh.

I've been fascinated by EDM lately; I come from a background of all musics. Started with radio pop music like most kids, delved into punk before splashing into everything metal. Thrash, death, doom, black, goth, screamo, heavy music to listen to and settled on kicking back and relaxing to smooth jazz, etc. I gained an appreciation for synthetic music as I too used to be an offender of labelling anything produced on a computer as fake and ""talentless"". After learning to make cruddy loops and beats on my computer I started checking out EDM; dubstep, hardstyle

Which leaves my associates with the belief that I must be goin to clubs, contracting herpes on a dancefloor downtown, and so on.

Which makes me wonder

As someone who listens to EDM are you really a drug addicted, smoke machines and pounding bass? Are you dressed in bright colors with pupils bigger than my fist chewing on your own tongue?
As someone who listens to classic rock are you currently wearing one of many classic rock t-shirts featuring the cover of an album that went platinum at LEAST 25 years ago? Does that shirt have a mustard stain on the collar? A mustard stain that matches the one on your beer gut AND the one in your beard?

After you got done robbing a bank, throw on your favorite rap record and krump in your bedroom til your moms called you for dinner?

Once you switched your From First To Last album with your Bullet For My Valentine disc did you go back to the bathroom to keep cutting your wrists or did you just wipe the blood away and kick up your nightly ""cry and watch myself in the mirror"" routine?

I suppose once the metal show ended you picked up what you could find of your teeth in the moshpit
But I'm sure no one on Reddit can relate. I'm sure anyone who uses Reddit is a Weird Al fan. And you're probably too busy playing World of Warcraft or ranting online about how your friend made fun of the music you listen to to read any of this. Fag.

Speaking of fags

It's really stupid. Really, I've seen every type of person in these crowds.
I've gone to country concerts expecting to see only dudes dressed in chaps and spurs, and refuse to accept that I have to turn my volume down on my headphones for fear that someone might hear a thumping 4 on the floor beat and think I'm an E-tard and I'm gonna try and touch their face if they get too close. 

Or a rap beat kicks up and (classic) the old man stands up ""turn that down! I don't call it rap; I call it Crap

It's been making me very edgy lately, fast or slow, metal or slowdance songs. Music is all around us, all the time. Most of the time we can't control it. Nearly every business, household or car that drives by has a radio going at any given time. Whether we like it or not, the music we disagree with is always going on all around us. There's really no point in getting angry that it's there, no point trying to force people to accept that it's there, its the SETTING.

Don't listen to death metal when you wanna fuck.

Don't listen to gangster rap whilst trying to set a romantic atmosphere.

Don't listen to reggae when you wanna have a dance party.

Don't listen to sad songs when you're happy if they make you sad.

Don't listen to dance music when you wanna sit and read a book.

We both know the truth; your family knows the truth

Saying “I am sorry” and never changing are empty words. You never even seemed upset with your actions. Did you ever once show an ounce of remorse? Besides the affairs, belittling me for no reason. Ever feel sorry for that? Do you even remember how crazy you were? You sold all of the furniture because it had “soaked up negative energy” you ripped walls out of the house and called it “remodeling”. You freaked out because you thought you saw the antichrist on 60 minutes. Should the list go on? Besides that you spent every penny we had and then borrowed more. New clothes, salon treatments, hair, nails, just simple maintenance of those things was ridiculous, but you deserved more, the plastic surgery

And please don’t start the “I raised the children” crap. You raised them while I was at work and then I took over. I stayed up with them when they were sick, yet were too lazy to get out of bed for a crying child that you claim to love so dearly. If you remember when we first got a dog (a dog you begged and begged for) you didn’t take care of him either. I asked if that was what it would be like when we had children, you promised me that you would change, you didn’t. But at least you got your beauty sleep, got what you wanted, and everyone knows that is what is important.

And speaking of children, working and working just to support you. Then once we had children you decided you didn’t want them, every minute you could spend out with “friends” you went. Great times!!! To know that I stayed home and raised the kids while my whore of a wife was out blowing random guys. What class, but I should have known better than to marry the town slut. I think my favorite was when C****** was sick with Strep throat and you brought two guy “friends” over to the house after a day at the wineries to wait on you while you changed to go out again. What a insensitive slut. Thanks for throwing everything in my face.

And yes, paid for it, took care of the kids, helped you study. Then you worked, and complained. My favorite part of you working was your idea about paychecks. My pay check was “our money” –pay bills, buy groceries with. Your paycheck was “your money” free to spend however you wanted. Except all of “our money” was already spent on you.

I suppose to sum up how extremely shallow you are when you finally confessed to having an affair the first thing you asked is if you had to return the diamond earrings I had just bought you. You destroy all trust

So, claiming that I was getting my revenge, my revenge, I just wanted out of the house after being the sole caretaker for years. Thanks for hitting me over the head with the remote control after I fell asleep. Sorry I grabbed you and made you stop, I know that was the “abuse” – the time you claimed I grabbed you while I was in a rage.

The one thing I can thank you for is at least I have some good stories. I talk to divorced guys all the time and no one has ever beaten mine. From the “I’m religious, just not for money, a one off prostitute, but it still an exchange of goods.

http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i64ny/other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so_pissed_off/

So I'd gotten tired of telling everyone the same long story over and over again so I hadn't updated here

So on the Friday that I posted the original post

After that I'm thinking, and I knew my case would require some digging to be 100% solid. So I became very upset. I'd felt that I'd lost and the bitch had bested me. 

I drove to my dad's house because my room mates idea of calming me down was to try and convince me via devil's advocate that I should assume she's innocent and look at that from her perspective. This absolutely infuriated me as I knew I was right.

So I drove to my dad's house so I could rant and calm down. My parents raised me to have a strong belief in what is right and wrong as well as honesty. And it wasn't so much that I was upset about the money. Honestly, it was $300 and I'm not rich, but $300 isn't going to make or break me. Instead I couldn't stand that someone would do this. It didn't even compute in my head how someone could do this. Especially since I'd thought we were friends. We sat next to each other at work, were constantly interacting and I thought it was a good relationship. 

And then there was the whole fact that someone who should be smart to be going to UCSD and able to get an internship at Sony. When I first learned that someone else had used my cash card

So before I'd calmed down talking to my dad, just for someone who is so stupid and wrong to be held accountable for what they did. And that's another reason the police felt worthless to me. The officer made it clear that their only concern was to get my money back, to retrieve what had been lost. It wasn't important to catch the person and hold them accountable. I didn't say this, but my thought was, ""But wait, I'm not reporting a loss, I'm reporting a CRIME!""

While I was talking to my dad in the kitchen

I turned to my dad and said, and at that point I'd felt they would be worthless (understandably, I get that my evidence was purely circumstantial from their standpoint and they need to be impartial in the way they pursue justice, but it still pissed me off). 

So I knew I'd won and now I turned my attention to enjoying giving the bitch exactly what she deserved. At that point I'd been so pissed that I wanted my money back

So on Monday I got all the paperwork from the court's website and began filling it out. My sister gave me instructions on how to write a declaration with everything I knew and then she made it all pretty and legalized for me. I printed off the subpoena forms as well and contacted my company to figure out who I needed to name in it. I had been nervous about that part. I was scared they might resent me for subpoenaing them

My plan at this point wasn't to actually file the lawsuit. I wanted to get it all ready so that it just needed to be filed at the courthouse. I was going to take the stack of paper and confront her about it and I felt that if I made it clear that this wasn't just a typical ""I'm going to sue your ass"" kind of threat

I met with the HR manager again on Monday and updated her that I felt the police wouldn't be of help and told her my intentions of filing a law suit. At this point I told her she could go ahead and talk to the suspect. I'd asked her to hold off until I spoke with the police because I'd felt that the only way to definitely prove her guilt was if the police could find the purchased items in her apartment. And I didn't want to clue her in that I knew she'd done it so she could get rid of the evidence. The talk revealed nothing because all the HR Manager could do was tell her that someone had stolen it from me and ask her if she knew anything about it. Obviously she responded that she didn't.

But now I didn't care because I knew I'd get the video evidence I needed and it didn't matter what she did with the merchandise.  I also stopped being nice to her. Up until that point I'd been reigning everything in so I was still acting perfectly normal with her. Now I just flat out ignored her and it was kind of fun watching her reaction to it. Obviously I'd respond to anything purely work related

The HR Manager had also told me that I needed to handle this outside of work and asked me not to talk to her about it at work. This was a bit of a problem because we worked different schedules so I didn't know how to get to her in person. I also didn't have her number or personal email. My room mate was facebook friends with her

My dad had been strongly advising me that I can't just flat out accuse her of it so I chose the words carefully. I just said that on Wednesday night I'd found out that my warranty card had been used and that Staples managed to bring up the security footage of the person who used it. Then I said that the footage showed her using my card to buy the stuff. I said that I'd already drafted all the paperwork to file a lawsuit against her and if we hadn't resolved this by lunch time the following day

So the next day I went into work. I was feeling really anxious because I don't like confrontation. I just didn't want to deal with it. But I walked past her cube and sat at my desk like normal. After a minute she pinged me on microsoft communicator

With that inkling I went all spy-mode and I brough up the voice recording app on my phone and tucked it into the breast pocket of my shirt. When I entered her cube, Hayden Christensen's performance in Star Wars felt like an academy award performance compared to this. She pretended to freak out like she couldn't believe it.

She asked me to follow her and we went outside. And this is the best part. Are you guys ready for this? It's awesome.

Her story... was that on Wednesday a friend of her's that she's in business with called her up and gave her a Staples giftcard code and pin number to use to buy some business supplies. She said that he'd gotten it off craigslist and she couldn't believe that it was mine.

For a minute I just stared at her. I could not believe that this was the best story she could come up with. It was so fucking ridiculous. I honestly couldn't believe for a second that she could honestly ever expect me to believe it. She wants me to believe that someone else at work, by astronomical odds, it just happen to be her fucking friend who bought it and just happened to give it to her, the only person at work who knew and that sat ... right... next... to.... me....

But I went along with it, but they'd definitely have it and I would be surprised if they didn't make tape backups of everything and such.

Every single one of these groups of activists.  Whether it be feminists, or as a person of color and you  try to make them the foreground of everyone's universe

Now before I continue, no matter what it is that makes you stand out, that makes you different or unique.  We should all be treated as equals.



HOWEVER.



This is not excuse for you to laugh at and ridicule and disrespect the people who aren't the same as you.  Now you're just doing the exact same thing that you don't want done to you!  I've seen a lot of posts about this ""butthurt striaght white guy"" or whatever it's called.  People of color think white people don't have struggles?  Women don't think men face problems?  LGBT people think straight people don't get bullied?  That doesn't sound fair.



As I said, or a few.



So this brings me to my side of the story.  So here it comes.  These are the struggles of a straight white man in our culture.



As a man, men are pressured to look a certain way as well.  We have to be chiseled like gods with washboard abs.  We see magazine covers too, you know.  The thing is, we're expected NOT to bitch about it.  I'm not allowed to complain about my body and the pressure I feel, because then it's, ""quit being a pussy,"" or, women can complain about this stuff because it's generally accepted that women complain



All a woman has to do to get a man is look fairly decent.  Men have to constantly prove themselves to a woman



So people of color think that white people don't struggle like they do?  I was raised by a single mother, or heat.  My father was in and out of my life, and he was an alcoholic and a heroin addict.  He was abusive.  When he was around, he would beat me and make me fight him as if I was a grown man.  This started when I was around 5.  He would also try to wrestle me, and he'd choke me so hard I'd pass out and wake up to him calling me a bitch because I couldn't defend myself.  ""Oh stop, you're fine.""  When he and mom together, he beat her.  He strangled her while she was pregnant with me.  I was a really troubled kid in school.  I was expelled multiple times.  Often lived in impverished neighborhoods.  My mom treated me more like a friend and confidante instead of a son.  She came to me with her problems when I was just a little kid

And as for LGBT, didn't know anything about cars, couldn't build a goddamn birdhouse in woodshop.  I was even picked on because I didn't have callouses on my hands!  I was a very small child, and was constantly made fun of.  I came home bruised every day and my mom was too busy working or trying to get someone to wife her up for financial stability to care.

So, white people, and men also deal with shitty lives.  So please try to consider that the people whose struggles you're trivializing might actually have some shittacular life experiences under their belts too.

It was a card to replace a chair I had under warranty for $300. I know 100% she did it

Staples was able to track the usage of my gift card and pull up the receipt and then bring up a picture of her from their security footage. Unfortunately it only shows the back of her but the description the employees gave matches her perfectly and the clothing she is wearing in the picture matches what she was wearing. She is also only 1 of 2 people I told about it

Since I don't have an image of her face

Plus, she doesn't need her keyboard at home. 

Regardless of security's response I'm going to the police during my lunch break today. Tried last night but they were closed.

I am so fucking pissed off. I don't understand why anyone would risk their $24.20 an hour job with Sony for a $300 gift card. I mean

A very *expensive* piece of equipment.

It won't turn on anymore. But you see, a frayed cable. N*oooo* . It's way simpler than that: someone left a valve open when they turned it off and the whole tubing inside dried out overnight (as you can guess, that's quite the big no-no) so now it's just sitting there with its nice little red error led blinking pathetically at everyone who looks its way.

Easy to find the culprit, right? It's the last one who used the machine, you'd say.

I write this as more of a farewell to what I used to love
To me, responses to the comments were given that both justified the concerns of the previous commenter and presented a different point of view. This was the standard ebb and flow of Reddit. This structure allowed for (mostly) intelligent conversation about issues with little backlash or useless banter.

However, with each hive being an idea or an opinion, and each bee representing a redditor. In the “Old reddit bee farm,” the bees used to fly into various hives as they pleased. Bees weren’t protective of a certain hive. They didn’t care which bees flew in and out, nor what their opinion was on the “structure of the hive” (if you will). Bees could fly to a hive, suggest possible improvements to increase the structure of said hive, and the bees at the hive would relay their opinions on the opinion. This, would lead to a stronger hive. Stronger hives breed stronger bees. Stronger bees + stronger hives combine to create one hell of a bee-farm. This is no longer the way Reddit works.

This new Reddit is a whole different bee-farm. A farm where the hives are strictly protected from bees that may give suggestions. Thus, and conform with the other bees if necessary. This isn’t the way things should operate.

Applying this to reddit, redditors swarm and attack the new redditor. “You must be new here.” “Riiiight.” “You must work for (insert unpopular company here).” “Trollololol.” Comment/post downvoted by everyone, because it’s being downvoted by everyone (the hivemind vicious circle). Logical fallacy after logical fallacy, ad hom’s and insults. This isn’t right. This help no-one. This method does not spur new and better ideas, it reinforces conformity at the cost of independent forethought. It makes the idea/opinion weaker, makes the hives weaker, makes the bees weaker.

Let’s take, like all scientific hypotheses, they often (and should) change. What has happened with this debate? /r/gaming has become a hive of pissed-off bees that are absolutely entrenched with the notion that the PS4 is the way to go. If a redditor came into the /r/gaming hive with anything other than the popular opinion, that bee was ostracized from the conversation and the opinion is left at the status-quo. I’ve seen this time and time again, and what it does is creates a swarm of ignorant pissed-off bees… and if that swarm gets big enough, it can do real damage.

Think about what happened with the Xbox and its reversal of some unpopular policies. Likely, MS probably doesn’t even know. However, eventually we will, and what if these changes, that were partially spurred by the angry-hiveminded bees of reddit, turn out to be horrible? What if they set the gaming-industry back? This is what I am afraid of, albeit not on the trivial video-game scale. I’m worried about politics, it could have a drastic impact on the way people live their lives.

It is excellent that Reddit has this kind of power. I love it, and these solutions actually being applied by governmental entities. The bee-hive is getting bigger and stronger by the month. However, if the bees of each hive continue to be simple-minded conformists, the power that reddit has could inflict severe (likely unintentional) damage to things that actually matter.

Reddit didn’t used to be this way. As I stated earlier, and the opinions would change. Redditors became increasingly educated about topics/ideas and the pitfalls to certain ways of thinking.
I loved the old reddit. It was an information superhighway. A place where hot-topics could be discussed rationally and people introduced meaningful

I don’t blame Reddit itself for any of these changes. Things change with popularity, but very few and far between the hive minded bees that control most hot-button issues.

There will be a few of you that understand where I’m coming from, just know that the hiveminded mentality doesn’t create anything useful. Does it allow you to feel a sense of comfort? A sense of belonging with the community and the (illusionary) feeling that your opinion is the correct one? Absolutely, all of the above. However, this doesn’t create any real lasting worthwhile change. It suppresses creativity and logical thinking. Please, keep this in mind as you watch Reddit grow and become increasingly powerful. Eventually, redditors will be able to change things that matter. You don’t want to be the one that conformed with the swarm and inflicted catastrophic damage. Rationality, logical thinking, and have become very scarce in the new reddit.

To avoid needless repetition, you resurface.

Tl;dr – Reddit isn’t what it used to be.

When you open your eyes and see what drives our generation (past, it's celebrities as well. If you want to remain relevant, you talk about or do things that others are doing. Our society isn't about parenting; it's about the marketing machine being all around us. Who ever created “molly” is having their product marketed by rappers. Weed is now the really cool thing to do now. With all of the legalizing weed laws, and everyone all about smoking it. Weed has always been around. But with the current society, they are all about making themselves look cool by admitting to smoking it. Hoping that someone will congratulate them or honor them somehow. This might sound weird, but really think about it.

Everything we do, one way shape or form. Whether you want to fit in at your new job or you just joined a church. You will do things that others might be talking about or doing, to make yourself noticed and likeable. And who is the blame, the media. Social Media is included.

How many people are on twitter, witty or just bite other people's post. Hoping for someone will notice them. Some people who are chasing a dream, like in music, modeling or acting. Their main purpose is to be verified on twitter. Because in their minds, that means that they are somebody. And most of the time, those people who strive for that kind of recognition don't give two shits about the dream they are chasing. They just want the status. 

This girl I know is just like that. She is all about Nicki Minaj and being a ""Barbie"". It pissed me off every time I hear her talk about her. She’s delusional. She actually calls herself a Barbie. She buys all of her stuff, and this is who she is. Instead of having a drive to hard, and get a good job. She wants everything handed to her. But complains about not having anything to be happy about. She hates herself so much, that she is trying to replace her real life with fantasy. 

And I gave you guys that story because that is how society is impacting our lives. Hell look at reddit. How many people on this website are trying to fit into the culture that this page brings? If you’re not an atheist, your kid will most likely be an asshole. And if you grew up not caring about your life, then you are the continuing trend of allowing the media and society to give you their morals. Which are all pretty much shitty.

Honestly most of this has to do with my SO of 3 years. We live together and it's becoming painfully obvious how different we are, we love each other and we tell each other regularly. But we have such ... differences...

Most of the time

But of course he wants to stay home all weekend and not leave the house. He works a standard 9-6 video game testing job. He is pretty introverted, and I need to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do. I have student loans to pay and I can't apply for assistance forever, dammit. THAT'S why I want to quit smoking pot - I can't afford it anymore. I can't afford going out to the store and buying junk food every single night. That shit is EXPENSIVE! The shittiest thing is that I have to be understanding about him not being able to leave the apartment.. he's too ""scared""... so I have to go and buy us goddamn munchies... I also have to be understanding about him needing to smoke pot because it helps with his stress. If I decline smoking that evening he gets really pouty with me and it's FUCKING ANNOYING.

I'm just really fucking sick of being broke all the time. I've missed credit card payments because of this shit... he always wants to stay in and send me to get shitty food for us... then when I come home he plays WoW &amp; LoL with his friends from work. They all Skype at once so I can't even talk in my own apartment. I would go into the bedroom and do my own thing but he wants me to stay out in the living room with him and sit beside him and ... reddit? Like why the fuck would I want to sit out there and not be able to talk or listen to music. I feel like a damn dog.

It's just expected that I know the drill. Come home from work, go get munchies. I have no time to actually try and plan meals so we have stuff to take for lunches. And why am I the only one TRYING to do this stuff? Isn't this OUR apartment, OUR life? Shouldn't he be helping too? Shouldn't he be thinking about this shit when he gets home from work instead of ""I need to smoke a bowl and play some games"". And it lasts right up until we go to bed. No change at all. He fucking loves this routine and it's making me so goddamn angry.

It needs to fucking end but how in the world do I even BEGIN to change it? He's recently suggested that he might be autistic but wants to get diagnosed by a real doctor. JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU ARE AUTISTIC DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT NOT LEAVING THE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO SCARED... how do people get too scared to leave a fucking apartment? I mean

Sometimes imagine what it would be like to have a boyfriend that would come visit me at work and not be scared of interacting with other people. These dream boyfriends might suggest going somewhere for dinner, and he has been supportive of me in a lot of ways... I mean, we moved states together and he used to pay for a lot of my shit when I was unemployed a few years back.

Second

Third

Fourth, every other statement is ""I'm drunk"" like, ""I'm too drunk for that,"" and, ""Well I'm drunk right now."" It just gets on my nerves since she does it for attention. People think she's being silly and I'm always tempted to just tell her how much of a bitch she is since, of course, she's ""drunk"" and would be ""too drunk"" to care.

Fifth, as she claims, the blue hair dye from a little part of her ponytail (that you can't even fucking see!) will run in the shower. So she can't shower because a little blue ponytail is really important over smelling good. I wish I could just leave a bar of soap on her bed as a message to shower.

Sixth, she refuses to do so because as she puts it, ""It's not my fucking job."" Anything that takes her away from her computer is like a detrimental loss in her life.

Seventh, ""Don't break it or I'll fucking kill you."" It gets old when half of her statements end with ""I'll fucking kill you."" She wonders why she can't make new friends. If she has homework, she's pissed because she has to actually do work. But when she does work, she has Netflix open on one monitor and Reddit on the other. She wonders why she fails her exams and drops out of classes because they're so much work. Her major is psychology which is not too difficult in my opinion but taking 3 courses total for her is like back-breaking work.

Eighth, and if you do anything like that in return, she'll just get defensive and break down in tears because she's a fucking psychotic maniac. I find it really fucking ironic and hilarious that she's a psychology major since she can't even get help for herself. How the fuck does she expect to deal with other people since she always complains about people?

Ninth, lights left on, and just makes empty promises to ""try harder to remember."" It wastes electricity and we all pay more for it. And of course, she's so poor!

Tenth, she just rants and expects you to be receptive. Everything you say to her just goes over her head and she just ignores it to continue on how her life is worse. If anyone goes somewhere for food, she incessantly nags them to get her food in which case she'll pay them back ""when she gets money."" Of course that's if you remember to keep reminding her for money. But it's so annoying since I usually have to sneak out to go to Wawa otherwise she'll ask me to buy her food. What annoys me more is when I'll be having a conversation with my other roommates, she likes to invite herself into it. Like if anyone is over, she immediately has to be involved and talks really loudly to emphasize her point. She constantly yells things like, ""NO IT'S FUCKING NOT!"" or ""I FUCKING TOLD YOU!"" She'll go to bed while all her annoying friends are over and doesn't give a shit about what they do. She fucking sleeps through everything so of course it's no a problem to her. But when I need to sleep, she bitches about how I'm annoying for asking her to keep her friends quiet. How self-centered do you have to be?

We spent a week after talking it through.. I spent time talking to.her as well... Trying to get the truth... In the mean time she had cut all ties with him.  He spent that time sucking up to me and trying to win me back... Needless to say I fell for it.

It's truly sad when these things happen on our soil and we all feel that pain because we can associate ourselves with them... (They are American families like ours, and go to learn in our schools...)

But again, I've accepted that the majority of humanity doesn't give a shit. But I want you, friends, to try and associate with this viewpoint, however different it may be from your own.

This pain that we feel today, some of us cut it off, and some of us allow ourselves to feel that pain, because we choose to associate and connect with all life on this planet, letting compassion guide our hearts.

I feel the same way as you do in regards to the Connecticut shooting and all of the other shootings and ""terrorist attacks"". But when these things happen, all of the inequalities and injustices on the personal rights of living things and beings, etc... I don't choose to think of these things because I'm a morose person, I love life. I choose to think of these things because my heart feels for those things and I choose to accept my feelings instead of bury them.

You may not see the connection, in hopes of reaching anyone.)

And while all I can do from my desk is post my emotional rants on Fb and Reddit, getting beaten and jailed, getting made an example of by regimes and getting publicly executed. I see many people now truly fighting for what is right and truly fighting for humanity, and that gives me inspiration and hope, which in turn creates more compassion within my heart, which I only want to share with you.

What's wrong with the world? Well

""Idealists"", they only want to help humanity. Don't discredit these people because they think different than the masses, it's these very types of thoughts that will create change...

People ask

Here's my opinion in short: The masses still believe in fairy tales, ignorant and greatly lacking in compassion for any life but our own on this planet we all share... I know it's incredibly cliche to quote Jimmy Hendrix here, out of all people, but when the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace.

Let's keep moving forward to make these connections one by one and to work towards a more peaceful

Let us make these connections before electing the next warmongering politician to do our work for us

Let us make these connections before allowing the next war to begin

Let's make these connections before choosing to support CEO's who openly disgrace humanity with shitty values and morals. 

Most importantly, pain, suffering, and further differences for us to disassociate with.

Yesterday, cool, whatever.  Who's leading the parade?  A firetruck pulling a piece of the World Trade Center.  My blood immediately began to boil.

This is November, no firefighters were directly killed by terrorists on 9/11/01.  NONE.  They ran into a building people were jumping out of to try and DO THEIR DANGEROUS ASS JOB THAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR, AND FULLY KNEW THE RISKS OF GOING IN THERE.  If ANYONE should be trying to treat 9/11 as a national holiday, it should be flight attendants and pilots.  They were the ones who were killed by terrorists by hand and appear to have stopped (with other passengers) the 4th plane from hitting the White House.  

When you work your way into being an airline pilot, you inherently take on a risk of being killed in the line of duty.

I live two blocks from a fire station.  3 years ago

In the weeks following the death of the 2 firemen, ""the fucking shit your stupid ass is supposed to be doing, because, you know, you volunteered to do it, asshole"".

Living so close to the fire station, etc etc.  NOW, there are about a dozen of them just in that fire station with ""in memory of"" tattoos.  Pieces of shit.

It's frankly offensive to me that municipal city workers with tremendous benefits and get to enjoy those benefits by going home every night are trying to co-opt a holiday designed for people who actually give several of their lives in service.

The jocks are shown as initially hesitant to join the group, at least through the time I stopped watching. He just can't allow himself to fit in, the way he should if the message is that music is for everyone.
The cheerleaders are stereotypically dumb as rocks, the BLONDE one (whose name just happens to be Britney S. Pearce. hmmm... sounds familiar.) The Asians, of course, are just the opposite of this. They have perfect grades and parents with super high expectations One of them got an ""Asian F"" once. Translation: A-. Is this true of some Asian families? Yes, but not all of them. The black girl is relatively normal, but happens to have a fully Aretha Franklin-esque voice. Of course she does, because all black people are jazzy or soul singers, because he has been made into a full-tilt diva. High voice and everything. He has a moisturizing routine and once memorably tried to sing with the girls.People like this do exist, I don't really know what to think. On the one hand, I had those fantasies once

That was a huge insult - guess what lady? My parents did the complete opposite of what you did and I turned out like a superstar in comparison to your bitter

I have a close &amp; strong relationship with my parents. I can talk to them about everything - ask them for advice or help when needed. My parents have always been there for me and encouraged/supported me in every way. They trust me and expect that I will do the right thing and have never enforced a curfew or made any attempt to 'control' me because they knew that I would be fine on my own. I have never been physically punished - if I ever did something wrong

I did chores to help my parents because I wanted to

I am a self-sufficient adult now. I got into one of the best colleges for my interest

I am unbelievably lucky to have had parents like mine.

I want to be a microbiologist, everything should just be field work and trade schools. If we know that most people learn by visuals and hands on learning, why do we demand such rigor in textbooks and multiple choice questions?  

How about instead of me spending 5 years on a degree that is general, so this way when I leave i'll actually be qualified for a job. This kind of shit breeds poor work ethics. Those that are good at taking tests can become lazy to just skate by, get a job that someone who's bad at test taking wouldn't get, only to lack the knowledge and understanding that job demands. This shit is unacceptable. The US sits here whining and complaining why we're so behind, it's because we stamp on those who know what they want to be by leveling the playing field for everyone. It's cute how many people get pissed off about communism while living in a communism education system that is funded by capitalism. 

Gah, just what it actually is about. College is what you make of it, but if you're not good at bullshitting the system and genuinely love to learn, you'll kill that part of yourself to be successful in college, or drown trying to save your love for learning. ",,False,t5_2qn2b,True

Your whore of a friend is ditching you for a guy again

Your friend who happens to be a guy doesn't want to date you and has told you a million times but you're still upset when he doesn't magically grow feelings over night

You failed out of college a few times cause you're too lazy to do the work

Your upset cause people who say your their friend but only use you to cut the price of vacation aren't understanding of your struggles

Endless problems of my friends that I take the time out to actually listen and support them through and all I get back is a cold shoulder. See, then I am no longer willing to listen.

For instance, buying her books, scheduling her classes, pretty much everything. I took a class with her so she wouldn't be alone with a professor who I knew was a great instructor. I referred her to my science professor who happens to be one of the best on campus. 

But then I realize exactly how she expects to get through college. We have a test in class, then gets pissed off at me for getting an A while she pulls a C. She pays more attention to her phone than the surrounding world, pays attention to facebook more than the surrounding world, then wonders why she has no real connections with people.

Just today we had a medical term test that had over a hundred conversions and medical terminology that we are supposed to know. If you get all of the answers right the first test, ""You fail this fucking class, I will not retake it with you."" So for an hour, we study back and forth learning these note cards. I had studied the night before so this was a refresher, but for her, this was the first time seeing any of it. We've had a week to study these terms. Still, she kept putting her phone in her face and I'm thinking. 'Seriously? you're gonna come into my house and sit there and ignore me cause your texting all of these people who could care less about you?""

Fast forward to class

A few hours later, and I say ""Just go check yours."" She got a 92/100, which is good but sadly it doesn't exempt her from the other two tests. I tell her how good it was and that the study session I put her through was actually beneficial. She again asks for mine, and I tell her. And she has nothing nice to say. Literally, nothing good to say to me. That annoyed me more than I can even express. She acts like a brat cause she failed to get her 100. I work my ass off to get great grades, it isn't my fault she thinks texting and facebook is whats gonna make or break her life.

She thinks getting a few likes on her FB status is more worthy than getting a letter saying she's on the Deans List. 

After all I do for her, yeah right. I told her that without me she would be working a dead end job with nothing to show for her life. She has this idea that we're still in highschool. You just breeze on through while trying to gain enough friends to make you popular or at least 'cool' enough to be recognized. College is the difference between having a career and being a pregnant trailer park mess. 

The best part is that she is talking to this guy online. If you ask me

Then tonight while she rambles on with this douche about his issues, I am not stupid. Secondly, I was trying to talk to her about something important and she says Oh I'm going to bed, talk about it tomorrow. When I know she is still talking to douche. As if I wasn't irritated already, she just added some fuel to it. Fuck you. I refuse to carry a bag of useless weight if she won't grow the fuck up and take responsibility for her fucking future. 

So tomorrow when she goes to IM me and wants to discuss

Fucking. Over. It.

1373010784.0,1hoiyk,You know what I like about dating?,tacocharliemike,28,13,11,"Nothing.

So yah, it's worth it.

Where should I start? Online or offline? There's so much to say it's hard to decide. How about offline dating, nasty, VD-laden dice. In my recent delving I've dredged up more 'married' women, prostitutes and actual psychotics than I've met in the rest of my normal waking life.

This is what I can't stand the most. I see a girl, a good house. Sounds like a good girl with things going on in her head, and I'm excited. The second drink is bought and as though summoned by accepting whatever shit specialty beer she's given, her husband enters the conversation with a throbbing vengeance: ""My husband does this, that and the other thing. And he's such a great guy""

He certainly must be to put up with your two-timing ass. He must also be a no-esteem rube to think you're being saintly on your weekly trips to the local dick-corral. That nice place you have? The time you have to build and enjoy your hobbies? That house you love so much? It's not paid for by your cashier job at WagaBag. Its probably paid for by your husband who is at home blissfully unaware that you're trolling for dick to tickle that old village well of a vagina you own.

I know some of you (womenfolk) out there are shaking their heads and saying ""she's only saying that to you because she's not interested."" Good for her. I had the same excuse presented to me by a couple friends of mine. The strange thing was that with all of them, concrete answers. Variables make us uneasy.

But then let's say she's actually married. She's not wearing her ring. None of them have been wearing a ring so far. ""Honesty""? So she's just here to get free drinks. You know what? Fuck you. You have a husband at home that (hopefully) works his ass off to provide for you and whatever cunt-spawn you've hurled out into this world before he met you. If you're so unhappy and feel so unloved that you need to go out and mislead others into giving you attention

What are you here for married girl? You want attention? Your husband tired of your fat

How about that online dating? Oh that's about as fun as a bag half full of used razors and herpes scars. Here's where the double standard really rears its ugly fucking head. One thing I've seen more often than not is girls who describe themselves as BBW's that are only interested in young, and gets worse from that point on in my opinion.

Another example. I've worked with a number of girls who have that ""queen bitch"" attitude. They take pride in their bitchiness. They have a number of T-shirts between them that sport such stirring anthems as ""Super Bitch"" and ""Look out

First off, but really? I've gotten responses from three people. That's not three people on one site, that's three people over every site I've signed on. I mean, that's not including gay or bi men, but still. One of those three? Still the most curteous girl yet. Told me that she was glad to hear from me, however she doesn't date bi men. I wanted to give her a medal and a donkey.

Like I said, you're hawt. I wanna put mah weiner in your bun"". I've spent time looking through profiles, finding interesting things to bring up and talk about. You say on your page you want someone interesting to talk to? I'm doing it. I can even see when you check out my profile and then nothing. Did I write my profile wrong? Do I have bad grammar? Is there an ethereal serpent latched around my neck that only you can see? I don't know. I can't fucking know because you don't tell me.

What about those good old lines I see so often on girls pages? There's that whole ""only dates fit men"" girl that's the size of two touring buses of course. How about this one: ""I want to be treated with respect"" in the same paragraph as ""I only date black men"". Hate to get all racist on your ass

You can't have it both ways. That's got to be the first thing I teach any daughter I have. I see too many girls online that are ""highly opinionated"" and yet they ""want to be treated like a princess"". Guess what sweety!? Princesses had posh lives but their voice meant jack and shit. And jack left town. You can be a princess in my house

""If your profile picture is just a dick

But on that subject

""I want to be pampered and taken care of by a loving man""... How would you react if a man posted on his page ""You will make me sandwiches on the hour and suck my dick every time I fart""? Probably wouldn't be appealing. Take a fucking hint. Men aren't free tickets to the easy life. But if you find yourself with one of those men

Ok now that that's out of the way...

YOU'RE SUCH AN ASSHOLE.  

Last year, talked about starting a CSA (community supported agriculture) on the property we are living on.  You apparently ""decided"" that you weren't ready to do that and told him that both of you should sleep on it for awhile because you weren't ""ready"".  A few months later... Guess who is starting a CSA with someone other than my boyfriend?  You.  You didn't even offer him a position in this business.  When he helps you with weeding or planting, you don't pay him.  Then when you're fucking successful because you're a shady asshole, you act like it's completely his fault that he is not where you are financially.  I know he could have perhaps taken more initiative and that he is responsible for his own success.  HOWEVER, that does not excuse you from making it harder on him by being an inconsiderate, backstabbing prick and then getting down on him when YOU are partially responsible for making his life harder.

ALSO

Oh and you also want to grow weed outdoors even though the landlord made it clear that that was not okay. You even said

OH LET'S NOT FORGET... Our landlord is nice enough to give us some of her family's goose eggs every week and we only get about 6 at a time.  These eggs are equivalent to about three chicken eggs.

It's not crossed people's minds that religious beliefs should be respected, religion has never been hot on homosexuality. If you're not going to force gays just to get a civil partnership then you can't force churches to marry gay couples. Would you force a Muslim to eat pork? Of course not, even though many of us would view that as a backwards and irrelevant to modern life.

I've lived here almost exactly a month and I'm seriously going INSANE. I don't know how 3 people can be so fucking stupid. They're all friends and I'm the random one in the apartment.

* They leave the dishwasher hanging open. Just fucking hanging wide open with the lower rack pulled out. ALL THE GODDAMN TIME! Why the fuck would ANYONE do this? It gets in the way and our kitchen is fucking tiny as it is. I have to fucking shut it 95% of the time I go into the kitchen.
* They don't know how to load a fucking dishwasher. They're 19/20 years old. Can't. Load. A. Dishwasher. I heard one of them ask another ""Do the plates go on top?"" earlier this semester. REALLY? ARE YOU FUCKING MENTALLY CHALLENGED OR SOMETHING? And you know what? They do put plates on top.
* They either don't start the dishwasher when it's full or they run it when it's half full and there are dirty dishes in the sink. Just what the fuck?
* Someone has this stupid fucking clothes rack thing in the tiny ass laundry room that you have to move out of the room to access the washer and dryer. And there are a lot of empty boxes on the single shelf in that room. I was lucky to be able to fit my laundry detergent up there.
* I guess they're all fucking deaf because they always turn the TV up ALL THE FUCKING WAY. And they leave it on ALL THE TIME IF YOU AREN'T WATCHING IT FUCKING TURN IT OFF HOW HARD IS THAT? Jesus Christ I'm always having to turn it off when I get back from class or want to sleep or study.
* They pile up trash behind the door. I don't mind if the kitchen trash is full and you move the bag by the door and plan to take it out on the way to your next class. But they stack bags and bags and random other shit trash behind the door so you can't even fucking open it all the way and leave it there for a week.
* They take their shoes off RIGHT inside the door so they're in the way when you walk in. I keep kicking them out of my fucking way and they don't seem to get the hint. Don't put your shit in everyone else's way. They don't understand this concept whatsoever.
* They leave trash and dirty dishes all over the kitchen.
* One of their boyfriends wears too much goddamn cat piss (Axe) and the apartment reeks of it when he's over. I haven't determined which boyfriend it is yet.
* One of them came to my room once to ask me a question. She said that she was trying to cook some chicken in the oven
* There are 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The bathroom is split - the toilet and shower are in a sectioned off area separate from the area with the vanity and mirror. There are 2 sinks
* Whenever I walk into the living room and one (or all) of them are out there
* There was a problem with the air conditioning but it's pretty much resolved itself thanks to the cooler temperatures. One of my roommates is too stupid to know how to close the vents in her room though and had to get her boyfriend to do it for her.

Those are the main things I can think of right now. Last week I picked up a room change petition and found out there was an empty 2 bedroom apartment available.

Receiving a positive karma score means that your content was well received by others and/or you contributed something of value to a conversation. Much like in a real conversation, you receive an upvote which is feedback from another person on your input.

Saying that upvotes and downvotes don't matter is like stating you don't care what people think about you. You do. You might act like you don't care but you feel good inside when someone compliments you and it certainly doesn't feel good to receive criticism.

Well it turns out the fuckers lied! You sent that letter out saying that if my attendance is good enough you will pay me. You know what? I got up two hours early everyday, because you promised me if I did this I would get money for it.

100% attendance and I've worked my fucking ass off for 45p in my bank account. Some people may be wondering why I'm getting so worked up over this. Other people from college have laughed at me when I got so angry because their mums give them money. See there's the difference; my family is on the bones of our arses. When your dad picks you up in his BMW and takes you home to a silver service meal I'm walking home to an empty fridge and bare cupboards. For the last three weeks there has been nothing in my fridge but an out of date cabbage. I haven't got a pair of socks. So now try asking me why that money was so important to me. I could actually buy a proper meal for once

So you don't give me money. Okay, why would they be? They've got their wages and gone home and left me stood at the cash machine like a cunt almost in tears because I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN FUCKING PAID. Trust me, I've tried getting a job, but nobody seems to realise how hard it is. People don't take on college kids, you know why? Because they've got to be at college everyday and can't work proper shifts! You can sit at your desk all day not giving hard working college kids their money, and that's fine, because at the end of the month you still have a pay cheque. 

Well fuck you. If its not in tomorrow I'm going to raise fucking hell with all of you. See those big posh glass windows at the front of the college? That shit can go for a burden and everyone of you lying cunts will get a well deserved earful from yours truly.

I dated a guy for over 2 years who was always the ""friend zone"" guy. He got rejected ALL the time. We were friends for a few months at first. I thought he was a nice guy so we started dating. I was his first serious girlfriend. He always told me how lucky he was to be with me. And after 2 years I found out he had been cheating on me the entire time. I guess the confidence he got from dating me really went to his head. **That ""diamond in the rough"" isn't always a diamond.**

He said he wasn't looking for anything serious (I was) and that we could just be friends. Fine with me. We still hung out occasionally. Then one night he tried to hook up with me again. I said no, right?

Well #1, and then you make money over the long term by having people buy accessories and having their car serviced at your location. Obviously if you sell most of your cars below cost (invoice) then clearly thats not how you make money. and #2, if the invoice on this truck is $37,000 and you can’t possibly sell it for less than what you’re offering me than why in the name of MOTHER FUCKING SATAN are you advertising a price many thousands of dollars lower than that? Someone being a recent college graduate somehow makes it easier for you to lose more money on a car? How does that work?

This is why people find buying cars stressful. You know what the price of a new car is? Its the price you are willing to pay. If you go to a dealer, thats fine.” They will sell you that car for $42k, but if someone else hassles them and haggles, they might offer it to them for $3,000 less. Or maybe even lower. Because its a cash flow business. They want to get new inventory and then sell it as quick as possible. That’s why people find it stressful because its hard to know what the “true” price of the car is. They could offer the same thing to someone else for less if the wanted.

When you label yourself as a ""nice guy"", and guess what? They aren't a fucking thing like you. This one guy, right? I've watched him spend five of the twenty bucks he had in his pocket on a sandwich for me because he learned I din't have breakfast that morning, he sat down gave me advice on that extended project even though he was in a big rush; and even though he got straight-A's, he broke down and cried when he learned that I failed, because **he valued my success and well-being above his own.** And when he describes himself, the last word he'd use is ""nice."" If you're gonna be a nice guy, and don't be nice to that girl

And the friendzone? Give me a fucking break! You know what I do when I get friendzoned? I move on and accept it like a fucking adult would. Because I know that even though I still don't have a girlfriend, and listen to your opinions because they find them interesting and not because they have to tolerate you. A girlfriend, in my understanding, should be all that and more to you, while you clearly just see girls as a carnal distraction whose opinions are worth less. Those friends I described, some of them are friends whom I feel attracted to, and while you would blame her for being a heartless bitch (she's pretty much the exact opposite of that), and I value our friendship more than any potential chance of getting my dick wet.

As for the assholes who get all the girls, if he uses some choice words and is completely sure of himself while saying it, they get all weak-kneed. It happens the other way as well; we lose our fucking minds at the prospect of some tail. But she isn't completely robbed of her rational mind; she knows he's an asshole, while he is not in complete denial of the fact that he is an asshole, so while a relationship may start up, they never last long. And since you are an asshole with no charm who swears up and down he's a good guy, she's able to think with 100% her brain and see you for what you are

Long story short, since the fault lies with you. I suggest you take a long, serious look at yourself before you describe yourself as a ""nice guy."" Oh, and lose the fucking Fedora! It actually makes you less sexy, because they're associated with people like you.

So I spend another 30 minutes making a .iso file of it. I get it to install with the .iso file finally. Ten minutes later, I finally click on the icon. It pops up with an error about disc authentication. The game finally comes up, only it crashes after (literally) 10 seconds. This repeats for a good 10 minutes.

I finally uninstall it and reinstall it. It works perfect now (thank god) but this ordeal reminds me why EA sucks. I feel screwed over by Ea...

TL;DR: I have had more issues with legally purchased versions of EA's games than I have the pirated versions.

1358064308.0,16hfi6,Don't talk to me like I'm scum because I call out your kid.,greenmash,18,3,7,"Ok

I’ll set the scenario.

We’re at a BBQ to celebrate the first birthday of a friends little girl. 3 sets of parents. 5 kids. 
I have a little boy

The 3 dads (Me included in the 3) were out the back watching over the kids play in a small paddling pool. 
We were a bit of a team

The 3 mothers where inside doing whatever the hell mothers do without kids (Possible orgy

Right. So while the 3 of us were talking outside

Pretty straight fucking forward

About 5 minutes later my son was splashing a bit hard and the host called him on it and told him not to splash – once again

Once again about 5 minutes later the host’s daughter (The 5 yr old) was throwing these plastic balls at my sons head – with a bit of force. I called her out and told her not to throw so hard. I didn’t tell her off

Her mother happened to be outside taking photos when it happened and really fucking rudely told me –

“Greenmash


So I was a little gobsmacked. I turned around and looked at her husband and he was equally as fucking baffled. He apologized to me and told me he was so embarrassed and ran inside to talk to her about it. 
I looked at the other father out there and his response was “You did nothing wrong mate


So this is why I’m a little pissed. 
Your 1 yr old was half way from choking on fucking rocks about 10 minutes ago. Would you rather I just turn around and tell the father instead of fixing the issue? I can assure you by the time I mentioned it she would have been gasping for air. 

How fucking dare you talk to me like I’m the scum of the fucking earth. I called your daughter on being a little brat and you get in my face? If my son had done something that warranted a talking to, or do it yourself.

I think I’m just rattled because the way I see it (As does my wife and the other guys) I did nothing wrong. Yet apparently she saw fit to talk down to me in front of all the children and the other parents. 
And me being me
God fucking damnit. 

Speaking to her husband after (Not the brats bio father) He told me that she’s raising a spoilt bitch who gets away with everything and even he has no power over trying to raise her.  
Some parents have issues with people telling off their kids. And fair enough. If I don’t know you and you tell my kid off I might be a little pissed. But we know these people. We’ve known them for years. So I don’t see why she got so fucking up in arms.

I was protecting my son from physical violence. 

Fuck you

This girl has been my best friend for the past two years. We were roommates and sure we had rough times living together but we also told each other everything, etc. I've confided so much in her and she in me.  

She's also the most patriotic Chinese citizen living in America I've ever met. She bleeds nationalism. Our new roommate this year is a close friend of mine who's also a Chinese immigrant. They're hitting it off swimmingly, etc. I'm Asian-American (2nd generation; I don't speak Chinese and I JUST visited China for the first time this past year--I hated it). I've never felt so fucking isolated. I don't know anything they say to each other without google translate, I don't study with them in our common area because they REFUSE to listen to any music in English (they've chanted ""China! China!"" at me before), and because of it I'm so outside of their lives. I've been having the time of my life the past few weeks just doing new things and meeting new people and FINALLY having a dating life and I have so many stories I want to share with them but they're always too busy to listen or just plain uninterested. I'll ask them about how their lives are going and they won't tell me shit. I'm trying so fucking hard to get back in with my fucking best friend; this shouldn't be this hard. But it's like she doesn't give a shit about me anymore because I'm a goddamn American or something. Did I mention she's racist? She is. Incredibly. She's admitted to me that she's afraid of black people and that she doesn't like talking to white people; and she REALLY hates Korea/Japan/whatever for Chinese nationalist reasons that ""you don't understand because you're not really Chinese"". Sometimes I think she thinks I'm a traitor or something. I don't know. I just want to hang out with her again and be fucking friends. I want to feel like I belong in my own goddamn apartment. I want to have people who give a fuck about what goes on in my life anymore. I'm trying and trying and she keeps turning me down.

For the past two quarters the handful who actually care about the language and the course have been diligently trying to do homework, and I really enjoy it, so I work hard to get an A. Meanwhile, the Tweets and the Football junkies flirt endlessly with each other while the others stare blankly at the screen. I don't know how most of them didn't fail 101, but here we all are in 102, like some perfectly dysfunctional family. There have been times when the people who want to do well can't stand it anymore, get up and tell them to shut it. We've done it politely, we've done everything we can think of that wouldn't illicit a fight right there and then.

Today was a different day. After half of class had been laid to waste because the teacher kept asking everyone to put their phones away, etc. etc., I couldn't take it anymore. I turned around, stared straight at one of the Twitterbugs, and asked if she was born in a barn, because even cows would've taught her better manners than that.

It was rude, I would have (not to the extent of saying I was wrong, I'm not. I have every right to fight for my education). Instead, she made this huge scene screaming how I was disrespectful, how the teacher was stupid (all the while her little posse are cheering her on). She then gets up and slams the door, leaving all her stuff on the desk. 

I felt a little bad for the teacher- he's from a country where children learn early on if they don't have an education, other than repeating the same things over in different phrases: Don't talk in class. Don't be disrespectful. People have a right to learn.

He had both of us stay after class (she came back just a few minutes before the bell) and naturally her group kept trying to egg me on. I'm used to it
When the teacher shooed them all out a few minutes early and had us stay behind, either. She went at it. First she asked Mzee (teacher) if she could say something. He agreed, and the first thought that hit me was uh oh. When a girl with a weave and accessories that would make a metal detector commit suicide says those words, you know it's about to be a replay of a Jersey Shore meltdown. 

She laid it on me. She told me I'd insulted her, insulted everyone in the classroom (to which I objected no, by being a bratty loudmouth, she'd done that for me). She stood up, in stereotypical intimidating fashion, got within a foot of my face kept saying things like ""You have no idea how hard I work to be here, you don't know where I come from, you don't know me

Let me point something out.
I never once said it was because she was black. 
I never once inferred she had received scholarships.
Most importantly

I don't know what our Afrikan teacher was thinking. Eventually he got tired of her trying to intimidate me and tried pushing her away, teehee.) She kept saying she'd done nothing wrong, and finally my patience wore down and I started yelling back at her, telling her it's my education and I have a right to hear the teacher, especially when all she can think about is what her next status will be.

Then I hopped online. Then I read the debates: Was it real? Was it all in his head? Was his sketch pad just his fantasy land?

I didn't want to think these things, anyway. That's the essense of the quote.

But I got to thinking and came to the realisation that there is *no possible way* that it could be anything but a dream. Here is why: (please excuse  jagged

Firstly and most clearly is the scene with the chainsaw. Not only is his victim running *screaming* through the halls of his apartment building AND banging on all the doors as she goes through, revving hub-ub is about? [pause] Not even after he drops the chainsaw several stories onto his escaping victim (she made it down all those stairs awful quick, didn't she?) and somehow disposes of the body without being noticed. He is naked or in underwear throughout all of this, if I remember correctly.

Secondly! There is the little matter of detectives. At one point they suspect him and/or search his apartment. Hmm, let alone the amount of blood gushing out of his victims open wounds? And did you notice how the carpet is spotless? There isn't a speck of blood anywhere in the apartment... not even trace amounts.

Other things which bugged me were the gigantic explosion of the cop car which he shoots. I felt this went from a very realistic scene (bullets having no effect on a car) to grandoise Hollywood style (massive explosion) very quickly. As in

Also, wouldn't you agree?

Des is part of his name. I can't say much except that he beats me up and constantly takes stuff from me. Occasionally it gets out of hand (see my weak shoulders)but other times it's tolerable. This is why i prefer him over Dan anyday. Unlike Dan Des is tolerable


Lastly D.
D is part of his name so here we go. D Is a condescending prick. He's like dan but 10 years older. and 10x worse. Let's just say thin: My mom said and i quote"" D is an ass. Do you see the way he acts towards you guys? I wouldn't consider him my brother if  were you."" My mom said that. She didn't give birth to him (technically he's my step bro) and she dislikes him that much.

My dad
My dad isn't bad compared to dan and d but he still is bad. He excluded one of my other stepbros dave from my family cause they got into a fight at my grandpa's funeral. We got back in contact with him and the first time we talked to him in years he was crying tears of joy and sadness because he could talk to us again but he missed us very much and he missed out on a lot.

It is a beautiful spring day here on the west coast. The sun was shinning brightly onto his sleeping face. In my mind i am screaming, clouds have come to cover the blue sky. The temp has dropped, thankfully nature is matching mood. 

Soon my husband will be joining the thousands of people that have died this year. I have been preparing for this moment for over 4 years. i don't understand why i am shocked that my husband is on a hospitable bed wasting away. He made it to his 38th birthday.We have said our goodbyes, a heart attach, be kind enough to you loved ones to let strangers take care of you in the end. I knew this was going to be hard, i knew his wishes and am following them to the T. i love him and will continue until he is gone and after.

I need to move out - I feel so stuck here with her. I feel like I have to contend with her messes and her slobby tendencies, so cleaning has taken a back seat). The worst part is that she wrote this on our window... she didn't even bring it up with me in person. It's written on the fucking window. I don't know how to respond to it. I'm just going to leave it, I guess. I'm really angry that she has the audacity to ask me about cleaning my dishes that haven't even been out for 24 hours. I've had to deal with her dishes (well actually MY DISHES), caked with food, for days at a time. I've had to deal with used tampons out in the bathroom, with her hair in the shower drain, with her carelessness with food being left out/ staining carpets/ on table tops and not to mention her near total aversion to doing any kind of cleaning. She has used the kitchen sponge to clean our bathroom, dish detergent, she insists on paying them herself

I know I'm probably not the greatest roommate, I'm not that crazy... I just want her to be respectful. The main issue is that we don't have the same philosophies about what constitutes 'cleanliness' and 'consideration'. I have to go through this for 2 more months.

I just moved to a new area and received a coupon for a free cut and style from this nearby salon. I looked up reviews and they had great ones, because you fucked it up.

I stated several times that I would be willing to pay money for extra time or services done to my hair. I even asked them if cash tips are preferred because I planned to tip over 50% of what the price of the service would have been without the coupon. Well, and long layers for texture. She said it would be great because I could even wear my hair with its natural curls with these long layers. Hair a few inches past the shoulder when it used to be halfway down my back is not long. You cut TWICE the length we initially agreed upon. When worn curly, this will barely fall past my chin. Also, you passed me off to another stylist mid-style so you could work on your long time client. The person you passed me off to does not know shit about hair and I could hear my hair snapping and feel it getting caught as it was being flat ironed. After you saw how bad it looked, you told her to leave it be and that you'd fix it.

You tried. I told you that it looked like a mullet and that I didn't like it. You added product to my hair for the breakage and it didn't work. You asked me how I normally wear my hair and you'd try that, but I walked out without even leaving a tip.

For example, I'm currently working on a 200 page (yep) project for Theology (yep) that is basically straight bullshit about my life and accomplishments. I'm only 17, if I neglect that God part

What's worse is that the time I'm wasting wouldn't otherwise be spent on video games or something equally useless. I maintain a few websites myself which collectively earn me a few thousand dollars a month and I do additional programming/web-dev stuff for clients. I truly enjoy this kind of work, but the majority of high school isn't actual learning. The majority of the time is spent on these useless projects and watching movies when the teacher decides they don't feel like working.

Here's the deal--my car broke down at a halfway point between where I am from and where my new hometown whilst returning after Thanksgiving. After a few weeks of dealing with the car dealerships and warranties, turns out they called in the morning, said it WASN'T READY AFTER ALL. So, yeah, I guess fuck that dealrship's maintenace department also.

Anyway, you guys are Redditors--figure it out or something. So I couldn't exchange the ticket online and then had to call customer service as if we're still living in the 10-10-321 era. That didn't help. Menu is terrible. No speak selection, the states are in order yes, but NOT THE FUCKING CITIES. Pressing 0 like it's a clitoris, hoping something will work, nothing does and I get frustrated post-menopausal-style like it's going out of style.

Next day. Go to window. Hand lady ticket. I get denied like she's goddamn Dikembe Mutombo and get told ""YOU HAVE TO MAIL IT"". Really? The last time I used the U.S. postal service

So NOW, I call to see if the bus is running on time. It leaves at 8:25. It is now 9:10. You mayhaps see where this is going.

No answer or a busy signal at 7:35. I was gonna bus it downtown, I find that THE BUS IS RUNNING TWO HOURS LATE. The fuck, I do the right thing for once in getting there early and it's 2 hours late. I don't show up early to do nothing. Well, maybe for work I do. Looks good I guess.

So I just don't know what to do or say anymore so I will just try and vent it out the best I can.

My life as been plagued by a whole lot of bad decisions that I have no one to blame but myself.

I think this  started on December 24th 2001 when I guess, so on that day December 24th 2001 she got aborted. So Christmas ever since for me is not a really happy times.

I don't want to blame her for anything that happened afterwards. I just look at this time as an event that started me down the road I am on.

We split up a few months later, party etc..I moved in with her. But as usual it was too good to be true. What really happened is she stole a debit card from her aunt's boyfriend and she stole the money. She gets caught and we make a deal to pay back the money.

So now I'm in debts when over my head

One night probably in 2002,it is past 3 am. Now I start asking myself questions, she didn't say anything about going out or anything. I look around the apartment and see a newspaper on the table, odd I think she never reads the papers. I look at it and what do I see? Escorts adds have been circled. 

I put things together and realize she's been selling herself and lying to me since I quit school. That is when I lost my shit. I mean

And she some how convince me it was okay and I should be her driver. Man was I ever blind or fooled by what I tough was love. We stuck together for 3 more years

Anyway during that time as you can imagine we fought and had a really troubled and fucked-up relationship I'm skipping a whole lot of it even with anonymity there are some parts of my life that should never be told and be my burden to keep. That is when I found a new love for easy money and all sense of pride and morality was lost in exchange. So I talked her into quitting it and I'll just drive for agencies since I'm making good money and we can pay off the debts. 

As I was working nights and for god knows what she wanted more money and started again in the escort business so thats is when we broke off and for some god damn reason I kept her in my life as a friend. Or maybe it was because of all the shit we had been through. That made me think I couldn't get a better friend that knew everything about me.

As that relationship ended I continued in the driver business and after a while I quit because I couldn't take it anymore the headaches from those girls yapping while being high on god knows what. I quit in 2006 

I get this offer from my weed dealer. He wants to hire me to be his runner

You might wonder my god LeGeantVert when do you stop making so many stupid choices in your life? The answer : not yet.

So in 2006 I get an apartment back and I'm on my way to make some easy money. Since it seems I still hadn't add enough troubles in my life yet. Life found a way to get back at me once again thru yet another girl I met. It was nothing serious it only lasted 3 days but managed to cost me about 5k in stolen materials and damaged goods in my car. How can that happen in only 72 hours? 

Well I'm cursed you know nothing good can happen to me and if it does it can only be to good to be true. After the 3rd day of intense sex she gets in her mind that she wants to move in with me... HAHAHAHAHA that was probably my answer before kicking her out the door. After all the hell I've been in

To get back at me she got some under aged kids to break-in my car and steal all my audio system. About 5k worth of it. A few weeks after the theft I finally find out who did it turns out its a 15 year old kid that lives 5 streets from where I lived and who for what-ever reason was friend's with the girl. And she is the one that gave them my address.  So me and a friend had some fun scaring the shit out of that family for a week until I let it go when I got my insurance check.

Hey you might think that is not too bad it kinda ended okay I guess? Nope good endings are not for me my friends oooohh noooo they are not for me or they just don't last long.

Anyway so a few months pass IIRC we are now in 2007. My failed relationships with the few girls I've been with have turn to shit that I can't even wish on my worst enemy. This creepy feeling of not deserving to be loved grew in me  put together with the shame of my past secrets that I couldn't share even with a girlfriend

So I closed myself to anyone that tried to get close to me and kept dealing drugs thinking now I should be problem free since you know I decided I don't want anyone in my life. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh fuck no. I went to bars a lot to drink my problems away and always used a cab r a DD. But one night for some unknown reason I didn't and used my car. Got busted for a DUI. A whole new level of shit hit the fan now. Lost my income for a month but managed okay started working again. And in my stupid mind let that DUI go unchecked court wise. So now booze is gone from my life thinking hey that will get rid of another problem so I should be on my way to happiness again. 

Fate as a way to give you many warning signs but I was dumb enough to not see them... Anyway on to the next chapter of this sad story.

The inevitable unwritten law of criminal activity happened to me. You think what law are you talking about? The one that says that if you take that road you will get caught maybe not the first time or the first few years but one day it will happen

So dumb ass self goes into panic mode and was kinda let to die by my boss. I was probably sold to save someone else's ass but its a long story and the details of those events are not important because its shit that was totally out of my control. I kind of quit/left to rot that job so I went to work driving strippers instead of escorts thinking well I'll make okay money till I get something better.

A few weeks pass

A childhood friend of mine that used to deal a whole lot of drugs got back in touch somehow with me. His offer : You know the drug business in the area pretty well people know you and since your old boss left you to take the fall

You can guess what I did next right? I took the offer and started once again selling drugs thinking well its been over a month and I got no news of charges and such maybe the cops just smoke it all or sold it off. Don't care need money

So at this point in life after so many problems I put some rules for myself: no gf

Everything went well at first until.... I get caught again.... Plot twist by the same cop!!! You know I'm a lucky guy right. Same old shit happens they find the drugs talk to me took my money

 In Quebec my raging American friend with the 3 strike rules, for the first arrest ) and now we add 2 more because I had weed and extacy! Oh yeah we have a winner here!

Now with all this shit happening I get my first letter with the charges for the first arrest a few months prior. I get a lawyer on that and what he finds was that I was about to be on warrant because of my DUI that I was too stupid to take care off. This fabulous lawyer was recommended by the big cheese of this organization... 

Yeah that is one effing big mistake that costs me about 10k $ You see this lawyer smelling the opportunity to bleed me dry out of cash and how a dumb ass I was. Was charging me 500$ every time we went to court but the twist is every time he would just set another court date the next month so he could charge me 500$ more. So during that time my business is dying because of bad associates, I still went and it was a set up. I get to the address no one is there I leave and that is when I see the cop car come after me. I get busted again but this time with only possession charges.

Now after that incident I finally made a right choice and quit everything thing altogether! Kept my minimum wage job struggled like hell to pay my lawyer. The Bosses tried putting pressure on me to pay back what I owed for the drugs kept telling them fuck I got no money all the money I have the lawyer is getting it

I get a room-mate to help pay the rent and get back on track. Everything was going okay for a while until low and behold the room-mate flooded the entire duplex from the second floor to the basement when he did some laundry after installing his washing machine

You see I didn't have enough problems yet! So lady luck turned her attention once again to me! That happened in October in an 1930's house! 14 000$ of damages and us without insurance! Oh yeah! How do you like that LeGeantVert! This time life ain't using some lube before its fucking you over!

So here comes a shit load of stress with my legal shit

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA with an extra A! 2 months later I got fired from my job! Oh wow that is like a baseball bat to the face! 

But hey I see a glimpse of hope in that because for once in my life I was actually fired from a job so if I had the numbers of hours needed for unemployment benefits I could get them

Yeah I'm not even lucky enough for that to go right... You see we are in the beginning of 2009 and that was my first experience with our oh so loved system.........

So the first month of waiting period is over
Another month passes

In the end it took 5 freaking months before I got my first check! I had to declared bankruptcy to protect myself from the flooding incident

Luckily for me threw all of this shit emerged one true Friend with a capital F it is not a grammar mistake. He takes upon himself to find me a better lawyer and supporting me into keeping on right side of tracks

With his help and a new found lawyer that wasn't screwing me up for money and the unemployment check coming up things were looking positive for me!

The lawyer bought me enough time to go back to school during my trial!
I went back to school but not on a rush decision because of my pasts experiences of bad choices I was like oh hell no I'm not taking a decision without making sure it is the right one. I went to a counselor did all the right things to make sure we find the thing for me. Turns out from the tests I took its a tough choice because I could do so many things. 

I ended up taking Land Surveying! And for once felt some what happy I was going the right path

I was focused and driven to succeed in that class

So the summer of 2010 comes around and I finally see and end to my legal problems with my sentencing! You see at that time I've came to see my arrests as the kick in the ass I needed to get out of the dealing.
I got a light sentence because all my charges were dealt in a package deal! And was my first offense

I was in jail all summer long got out just in time for the class to begin again after the summer vacation. I was more motivated than ever to succeed in that class!

Then comes October 2010

What happened was a mix up of the dates of my internship

I got paid all summer long and thought nothing of it because well I was in jail and you know sending those reports had nothing to do with me.

I got a letter saying I had fraud the system and I owe them back the entire 8 weeks of pay instead of the only 3 the internship was lasting.

So here goes another list of bad choices. I try to get to the bottom of this debt I got imposed on me. But that turned into a nightmare! So I just gave up on it and focused on finishing my class.

Which was really hard on my morale because all I could think of was WTF? I'm trying to set my life straight to get out of debt and I get a new one just thrown at me like that.

But you know what I've seen worse its only money. I finished my damned course! Got my diploma and found an internship!

Oh yeah finally the good times comes rolling you think? Not even close....

2 weeks into my internship my team leader and quits the job without warning after learning that the boss offered her job to one of her friends. That is where after all my experiences I should have seen that red flag coming up! Nooo I stick it out finish my internship get offered a job. I'm like awwww yeah!!! So I'm like one week off my internship a new intern comes in the boss tells me now I'm the leader and go on the field do the job with your 2 weeks of experience and you have to show him how everything works too. Major red flag showing that all the boss wanted was cheap labor and cutting corners everywhere

After an eternity trying to set up and the rage building in me from lack of any help from the office or my boss. We start the job everything seemed going well for you know 2 guys not knowing how to work the machine. I go take a look at it and the damned thing saved nothing, yards and whatever ). Which it was supposed to be in the metric system made me lose it! So I went back to the office and quit right there on the spot!

That was the end of my career in land surveying 6 weeks. So I look for any job that needs my qualification

So I start the job

So yet another recap we are in 2011. I've quit the drugs business since 2008. Went back to school in 09 finished in 11. Finished with my legal problems

Now in October

2 years prior

At this point in my life I was like bahhh its my mistake I'll pay it back no problem which I did. Now thinking I should be fucking clear of anything I can get back to my life.

Noooo now it was time yet again to get fucked over by people! I was sent 2 weeks in a far off Northern Quebec for my job I was ahh yeah I'm going to make mad money with the overtime! I get there

So I finish my contract with the company and everything seemed fine I was never told of anything bad about my 2 weeks up north.

All hopeful and stress free I start looking for jobs in my field because that contract was nothing to close to my field of work. It was somewhat related like a redneck 4th cousin's or something. I sent about 300 to 350 resumé when I noticed I never got any call back or anything? Was like what the hell man whats wrong? So I start thinking to my prior job in land surveying and I'll try a new approach and not say anything about them on it. Well at least that worked I got some calls but it didn't end up any where because  of my criminal record :( Yeah sucks but not much I can do about it. At-least I have enough hours to get unemployment benefits! 

But you know of my love affair I have with government services, destroyed, chewed out, abused and spit out enough times that emotions, family, love or soul are just words in a the dictionary that lost all meaning to me.

I pass the winter with out a job hoping that my contract job will call again when the job starts again in  the spring. Which they did! Oh boy was I relieved! 

Oh boy was I in for some disappointment down the road. We have a new supervisor this time around. Guess what? It's the guy that botches up the job every where he goes. Yeah.... that guy is the son-in-law of some big cheese in the company..... First Red flag was seeing that he promoted his cousin that was working with him that only knows how to fuck up a job before people that had more experience. Then he turned the company into a freaking hell for people that weren't part of his family or licking his ass.

After a few months

Anyway looking at my options they were limited I didn't quit. I started getting my productivity higher just to show them the mistakes they made about me and judging me on what other people say.

So anyway I get treated like shit the rest of the contract for all kinds of reasons that to be honest I don't care anymore about because all I cared was to finish my contract again

Now this should be the start of something good. You know after 4 years keeping in the right path

To keep in my oh so good luck I get a delivery one night to some place. I go there no worry in mind except to get the food hot. I ring the door bell and this guys answer. I do my thing say the price he goes to pay me and says wait a minute I know you! LeGeantVert! You know Mister X from your drug dealing days! My jaw drops I'm thinking fuck me after all this time I've haven't seen or heard anything about them since the last time they took whatever of value I had 4 freaking years ago!

He goes yeah man I was stuck with your debt and now you have to pay me back. 

So this bring us back to today I'm fucking pissed

I don't know what the guy wants out of me but I don't have the money to pay it back and I'm done with this part of my life I never want anything to do again with it. I've paid enough already! I've had my share of hardships for 3 lifetimes. I've lost so much, my dreams and hope even my family left me. I'm alone, broke and all this shit comes back in my face a few weeks before Christmas. 

I'll probably go insane and do something really stupid because anyway whatever I do there is no such thing as an happy ending for me... Even if I manage to fix this up what will come next? 

Another year starting on the wrong foot

But hey I guess that was my price to pay for all the wrong decisions I took with my life I  must have deserved it.

I begged my parents, and a giant pool with a trapeze, and a day where all you do is play commando in the forest at night. Sounded rad.

I felt obviously uncomfortable, but I guess I was still too young to understand why.

A couple years go by. You trick me into attending various church events you knew I wouldn't want to be a part of with promises of rock climbing or Frisbee golf. One time you were up front with me and asked me to come to church because if she brought someone you got a prize or something which I wanted you to win. Got there

Fast forward to high school. I see on facebook one of those ""say 15 things you can't say to certain people"" posts. Thought I'd snoop, ""what wrong path?"" She avoided the question. I'm doing well for myself, but I've gone down a wrong path apparently.

I got into an argument with her whole family about evolution and how the world isn't 6000 years old, I returned yours because I read it. ""Oh, I still haven't finished the first chapter."" Of course not.

You mean, because they have a gay character right? You're Mom also doesn't let you live on campus of the college you attend which is an hour away from your home because that would involve having to get a vaccine which you also don't believe in. Having her make decisions like what you watch on tv is definitely what a 19 year old should be doing. But I stay away from those topics because I know they upset you.

But there are a few questions I want you to still answer. Is the only reason you're friends with me is because you think you can ""change"" me? Am I still on that ""wrong"" path? How often do you pray for me, I would think pedophiles and serial killers would go there... not people who just didn't believe something you did. So, if I am, am I really that wretched in your eyes?

I have a great deal of fucking problems with the mass amount of temps places hire to begin with. For one its awful for the fucking economy as a whole. Also you are decreasing the quality of life physically

Today I got called to my managers desk and was presented with a broad question...""how have things been between these two employees?"" So in return I give him a broad answer giving some example of there typical interaction and nothing from what I could see was effecting the work place or making a hostile work environment. His response to this is ""well that isn't specific enough and I'm ex-military...(small ignorant ass rant about how this makes him extra powerful and some BS)...and I have no problem terminating your contract as a temp here with us.
Okay at this point I am already nervous as fuck cause this guy is on some fucking power trip and he just threatened my employment because he can and he knows this will make me say something even if complete BS because I am fear of losing my job cause he doesnt have to have a real reason to fire me because of my temp status at where I work.
So I try to be more specific and he stops me and said ""no I need SPECIFIC."" and fucking glares at me like I'm a complete dumb piece of shit.
Finally after about twenty minutes of this shit he is satisfied with the stories I have told him  and mentions my employment here being temp and I leave.
This is fucking 100% BS!! I understand want specifics but throwing your ignorant ass ex-military mentality of threatening me is crap. I might be a temp but that is because The ecomony sucks dick and thats basically the only jobs open where I live
But all im all the whole fact that US employers have approximately half of there staff as temps is complete and utter BULL SHIT!!! Ans it doesnt help that when you hire them that Your employees treat them like crap because they cant do anything about it.

I can imagine their future from that point on. Don't get me wrong, most teens are too immature to fully take care of themselves, let alone an infant that is completely dependent on you.

Granted

I think what makes me most angry about this is there is a clinic in this town that will supply you with free condoms and birth control. There is even a variety of birth control: pills, etc. You don't even need parental consent; you can walk right in, ask them for an appointment, and in two weeks you will start off with three months of Orthocyclen. Then after you check up you get a years worth. 

Why are all these teenagers getting pregnant if it is so easy to prevent it?

1373303117.0,1hvh4q,My stepdaughter is abused and neglected and there's nothing we can do about it.,vlu77,14,1,17,"I have been with my SO for eight years. When I met him, it was like she was scared of people. Terrified even. When I would see her coming from her Mom’s, tired and hungry. I was just the girlfriend then

So, Jennifer would pack Sarah’s bag. When I spoke to Jennifer I was able to find out that she did all the laundry, she fed Sarah when they were at home, cans of soup and noodles and Kraft Dinner. I learned that they never, ever, ever make it to school on time and miss tons of school days. Their mother has always been notorious for being late for everything and has not been able to hold down a job because of it. We’re not talking 5 or 10 minutes late, we’re talking hours and sometimes days. There are no exceptions, their mother has not been even near on time for one single thing.  I really wish I were exaggerating. I really do. 

I also learned that their mother had boyfriends on and off and they would move in with them almost immediately. It was more of a money necessity thing than it was about her being in love. Having someone to pay the bills was the idea. These guys were no prizes either, when we go to report it she doesn’t want to get the guy in trouble so she won’t say anything. 

So, and lived in 9 different homes, including couch surfing at aunts and cousins and friends.  Sarah has a bed wetting problem and the laundry never gets done which means she sleeps in her own waste every night and goes to school in filthy, urine-smelling clothing. Their home is a disaster, filth and mess everywhere and they keep adopting animals and then when they get to be too much they surrender them at the shelter, and then they adopt more animals. And so on and so forth. Over and over. At one point Sarah had a pet rabbit who was kept in the garage at one of the places they lived and I am positive that thing was forgotten about and starved to death alone in the garage.

Sarah has an eye condition for which she had to have surgery when she was 6. The doctor explained that in order for her to heal properly

In the 8 years I have known Sarah she has been to the dentist once and that was after we fought and fought and fought her mother to finally have her on our coverage and we set up the appointment and we took her.

We have, she has been reported by Sarah’s friends families, she has been reported by a retired suicide counselor and a retired school teacher. The ministry shows up at her house, asks if everything is ok and leaves. They do nothing about any of this. 

In 2008, we’ll call him Tommy.

About 3 years ago, nor a job. They were just going to drive there and wing it. This is about 6 hours away and would have cut into our time with the kids heavily. So we took her to court to stop her. We also urged the courts to consider letting Sarah live with us. The courts told Sarah’s mom that she was not to move the children outside of the Lower Mainland but that they would remain in her care. In order to move them from the Lower mainland, she was required to have written permission from Sarah’s father. This is in a signed court document. So she midnight moved to Chilliwack (about 2 hours away) without our consent and told us as she was doing it. We called the police to enforce the agreement and found out that the only way we could enforce the agreement is by taking the mother back to court, which would mean we would have to serve her again with papers, in Chilliwack, while she was avoiding us at all costs. The situation was fucking impossible. 

They have since moved back because of course she lost her job again and of course she was evicted. After a year or so of bouncing around on couches, drove them home and then texted us that she had nothing for them for Christmas, that they had been notified of eviction in November and that at any moment there would be a sheriff there to remove them. She told us she didn’t put up a tree or stocking or anything, she didn’t even have cards or anything for the girls. This was being told to us at 11:30pm on Christmas Eve. To be clear, had we known, we would have happily had them here over night and had their stockings up and been prepared to fill them up with gifts and treat everything like there was nothing out of the ordinary, but we were given zero notice. We insisted on picking them up in the morning so they could come and open their gifts from us anyway and have some kind of Christmas. 

Now she has been hired by her Uncle, and has a brand new phone, pays for Jennifer’s phone bill and drives about an hour to and from work each day so she pays a lot for gas. How is she making this kind of money cleaning her Uncle’s house? This makes no sense to me. We have continued to report her. Sarah’s friends families continue to report her. The child is neglected and needs help and no one will do anything about it. 

When Sarah comes to our house on Friday nights, unclean, smelly, hair tangled and unwashed, dressed in filthy ill-fitting clothes and comes empty handed. We immediately get her in the bath, get her in some clean clothes we keep at our house, and work on talking to her and cheering her up. By Sunday, relaxed

We have gotten Sarah into counseling and her counselor was almost immediately shocked at her level of care and immediately reported the situation to the ministry.

Over the past couple of months, that she wouldn’t plan anything for Sarah’s party until it was far too late because this is how it happens every year. So I spoke with her mom on two occasions, she spoke with her mom on several occasions and my SO spoke with her on several occasions. She knew we were planning the party and in her own words said it was fine. So we made plans, we sent out invites (you can see them in my submitted links). We have had 11 kids RSVP that they are coming. We bought Sarah a new outfit and we bought prizes for the games and ordered the cake. This is happening this coming Saturday. 

So last night we asked Sarah’s mom if we could have her for a few extra days this week. She said that we could for two but that on Wednesday she was taking the girls to Drumheller, proving we spoke to her about this. 
I just am at a loss. I don’t know what to do. The government won’t help this child, homework help, love and support. But yet they leave her in the filth of her mom’s home, her mom ruining every special day of the year for her. Most of the time when Sarah is not at our house she is at someone else’s house, she is rarely at home getting pawned off on anyone who will watch her except us, just to spite us. Her mother just wants to party, she goes to every rock concert in Vancouver no matter what the cost all while her kids live in absolute filth and poverty. She has left Sarah home alone at age 7

This child is having her childhood ruined

We can’t afford a lawyer. We can’t get help anywhere. I don’t know what to do and I am so sad and fed up. This child means as much to me as my own and I am witnessing her be broken apart. I just can’t understand why no one cares.

And now for the credit cards. As you may or may not know the sole purpose of Sears is to make sure you get one of their credit cards. We have to get a certain amount every day or else our bosses start talking shit about us. Basically how it works is for every $1000 sold you have to get one credit card. Now that may not sound bad but what happens when someone buys $500 worth of items? Well your shit out of luck because you now have less opportunities to get a credit card and be positive. And someone buys AT LEAST $500 at once every day.  Usually more. So far I'm negative 22 credit applications. I ask every customer, offer them discounts that I shouldn't, and trick people into getting in but I still come out negative. I get at most 3 a day but my fucking co-workers who come in with their low cut shirts and push up bras always get 5+ a day. I can't flirt with the fat horny Cuban men who haven't even seen their wives dried up wrinkly pussy in years, and because of that I'm getting fucked over.

That is until junior year. As a result of a combination of a few things I worked my ass of junior year and earned my spot in the priority boat along with a novice. Now this novice was no ordinary guy. Novices who aren't freshman have a hard time making the team let alone making the priority boat. This guy was fucking gigantic, and we were all very proud. 

Now comes the rant part. So at the end of every school year, and give away some awards, namely the ""Most Improved Athlete"" award. Now I'm not a cocky person, but I had my eye out on that award. I had improved so much that I went from a boat in which the other member was cut from the team after the season was over, to having an undefeated season. Not that my other boat mates hadn't had the same amazing season, but they didn't start from the bottom like I did. So firstly, the banquet took FUCKING FOREVER. I mean, and we were there listening to my asshole head coach thank people until like 11. But I wasn't mad. I was just waiting for my award. I had made sure to be very humble to people beforehand. I never outwardly said I wanted the award to anyone but my friends and boat mates, and some even mentioned the award. I was always sure though to diminish its importance though. After all I knew I improved

So award time comes around

Housemate A stopped talking to everyone out of the fucking blue, so it's not like we alienated her or made her feel bad, or didn't understand what she was going through. Hell, the least she could do is let us know she wanted space, and that would've been totally fine with us. In fact, it would be infinitely better than leaving us to worry about her and wonder what we did wrong. Found out later on that she pulled the same stunt last year, so any sympathy I had for her: gone.  It's a shame too because we got along really well.  She was crazy and fun to hang out with and now my already tiny friend circle is shrinking even more. Fanfuckingtastic. 

Housemate B has been alright up until the last week. She's moving out in two days and going on a gap year thing so I probably won't see her for at least two years. Initially I was annoyed but now I'm thinking, and we could joke around about pretty much anything. I let so many things slide because I didn't want to seem petty but guess what? Turns out she fucking does. When we go out clubbing, I ask her how she is and she's just standing there pretending to shoot herself because she's that bored, and that sober. I go out clubbing to keep her company. I do it because she suggested it. And what does she do when she's there? Act like the most miserable cunt in the world.  


That's not even all of it. Like I said


Her and Housemate C seem to think it's okay to speak in French around me, do it later over Facebook chat or something. If it's not talking about me, maybe saying it in English would be better, no? Cos that way, even if I'm not included in the conversation, I don't feel like a fucking idiot. And for god's sake, at least have the common decency to *not* speak in French in front of my boyfriend. Doing it in front of me is one thing, but at least they make small talk.  


I recently messaged Housemate B because I could sense a lot of tension and I wanted to make sure things were okay, to them, so we  could enjoy a nice evening out. And they've been flakey when it came to deciding on a date for this night out, but hey, the tickets are valid til next month so whatever, no big rush. Only now, Housemate B is using that as an example. I don't owe her fucking anything, she owes me. If she wants to go to this party so fucking bad, she said she messaged me on Facebook a few times.

I am taking her deep freezer and this really nice set of dressers. I drive a small car so I can't transport these things on my own. Today is the last day to get them because she is moving.

My parents can't just suck it up and deal with each other for five fucking minutes. Upon telling my dad my mum said no, just like every time the topic of my mother pops up. I am sick of that conversation. I've been getting it for 12 years. 

It's not about the dressers. I'll find some. Buying dressers is not the issue. It's that when one (or both) of them offer ""help"" strings are *always* attached. I've also found that saying no to help is futile as well because then I get a lecture about not being grateful. If I refute or disagree

I remember when they first divorced and things were really rough, would free me from these games they played with each other. But it hasn't. It's just made the games more convoluted and the relationships more strained.

Basically almost every thing my parents say is a question

if I don't provide my work schedule to them they ask me several times a day about my schedule. if I don't come home immediately after work my mom freaks out thinking i'm fucking dead or drinking a fifth of vodka driving down the road or some shit. My dad doesn't assume the worst but he still asks immediately as soon as I get home where I was and why I was late. 

 They also want to know where i am AT ALL TIMES, and when exactly I'll be back. if I'm carrying anything when I walk in I'm asked about it (""What's in your hands/the bag/tucked into your hoodie pocket""). if I'm going out to hang with friends, they always ask who it is and then want to talk about who these people are even if they haven't ever met them. They say they are ""just making conversation"" but it seems like the only thing they ever ""make conversation"" about is details of me (and my brother's) life.

 I either didn't notice or didn't mind when I was in high school but I'm not a fucking kid anymore and I don't need to share every minute detail of my life anymore. This is compounded by the fact that there's basically no privacy in the house thanks to bedrooms being feet from each other and the downstairs mostly being one big open room. If I'm in my room with my door closed my parents will just yell up the stairs and expect me to come running that second. If I don't immediately drop what I'm doing they ask what I was doing. Sometimes its actually personal, or doing some kind of paperwork. But all the same I don't want to answer that question every time i fucking walk downstairs.

I have nothing to myself anymore. It actually affects me because I am trying to get back into school but they ask me like every week if I've made any progress and soon it becomes less about trying to get my life on track and more about just getting them off my back

Ugh. I didn't explain this very well because it has me all riled up. All I can say is its like the spanish inquisition and its driving me nuts because I have nothing to myself anymore. Am I overreacting?

Almost no matter what, the unmitigated gull, to blame men of objectification. Are you fucking serious? Yes, men tend to view certain women as objects. But most of those women are models or celebrities, then of themselves objects to marketing and a special brand of voyeurism called fame. They (well, most) accept that men will view them as such. Here and there they'll stand up for the empowerment of their kind, it's common. But those woman are objectified simply due to the fact that the industry they're in makes them objects.

The point does hold true, there's a problem. That I can agree to, as once you get into the real world, people are anything but objects, and those that objectify others are quite simply disgusting and singularly minded. But women do this too. And it's made worse by their oft outrageous claims against men because it's ""so common"" among them. It's not that it's common, it's that we're more forward about it. That's a very common male attitude; men are often very blunt and straight forward. It's the clearest line of communication as there's no discrepancies and no misunderstandings. It's not always deal in some social situation, but this line of communication makes up a very large portion of male culture

Women, making their lives more like a political drama intermixed with Martinis on Saturdays. Subtle cues and undertones are over-analysed by females and thus they tend to over-react and once they realised they've over-reacted, some are too far-gone that they can't find it in themselves to recognise their mistake. Again, not always true, but from perceptions of the every day citizen, it's extremely common. That aside, sexual desires and interests are rarely discussed outside the home or ""watering hole"", this is no worse than saying ""That girl has a nice pair of tits"".

She finally decided that I lived too far away from her boyfriend, is because I warned her to get it, or I would donate it to charity.  The next day she sent me a text claiming I ruined something of hers by storing it in my basment, and wated $50.00 to replace it.

1. Fuck looking for work.

So basically, I don't want to hear any shit about how I picked a useless degree and didn't do enough to prepare myself.  Because I fucking did.  It's just that shitty right now.  The last job I interviewed for was two months ago, I was very overqualified (but still would have loved the job!), and I was beat out by someone with MORE EXPERIENCE.  So fuck them, I am getting more unpaid experience

2.  Fuck loud shitty rap music with the bass turned all the way up.  I live in an apartment complex.  Everyone here is either an idiot who doesn't understand that they are forcing everyone to not only hear but FEEL their shitty shit shit music, three floors up playing it way louder than our next door neighbors ever did.  It's so ubiquitous here, and I'm not at the point of madness yet where I'm willing to run around several floors and halls just trying to figure out what apartment it's coming from.  Getting there.

Here's a few things that can help your experience so me and you can leave the hotel happy. Seriously use these or think them over if you ever plan on staying at a hotel whether it be a vacation or your too tired to drive the rest of the way home.

1. If there's something wrong with your hotel room, yes I know it may have worked when you first went into the room but a simple phone call can let me know that I need to move you to make you more comfortable. This has happened to many times to count, I am more than happy to help you move your luggage cause I know it sucks. All it looks like to me is that you never intended to pay for that room in the first place.(I know that's not always the case)

2.YELLING AT ME DOES NOT HELP. Plain and simple. You can try to embarrass/scare me at my hotel by raising your voice while everyone is down for breakfast but I'm 6'5 260 pounds and I could not give one shit about your problem if your yelling at me. Why should I want to help you? 

3. I personally hate hotel sites like Travelocity and Expedia. Nothing against them as a business because you may find one hell of a deal and that's great. But if there's something wrong with your room, he started raising his voice, Well I didn't tell you to go through them it's your choice and you have to think about that before you book your room. 

4. Don't leave stuff you can't live without in your room especially if there's no lock box. Unfortunately we do live in a world where housekeepers are more than happy to take care of that pesky item that you love so much

5.And make sure you have your big ticket items with you before you check out

6.Last and not least, he said he was going to ask his wife and I decided that I would change the rate once he got back in, BUT his wife came in bitching about the rate so I let them walk out. 

7.If we are sold out, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? I've been called a DOUCHE BAG because we were sold out. What the fuck do you want me to do about it? kick some one out? (coincidentally we have had some one want us to kick someone out before...)

Being nice does wonders, I jump at the chance to give you your money back so that I hope you'll be back. I don't want rude people to come back, ever. Nice people I want to make their stay the most pleasurable experience in the world. If they have a problem, I will do back flips to fix it.

You do not have your own definition of ""atheism"". Atheism is not your political ideal. Atheism is not anti-religious. Atheists are not irreligious. Atheism is not rationality. Atheists do not simply ""not believe"" or ""arrive at that conclusion"".

Atheism is simply the rejection of belief in deities. Nothing more. At all. Zip. Nada. Nani mo. Nichts. Nichego.

Stop promoting your political or anti-religious stance under the guise of atheism, Jains (Jainism) and many other religious people are atheists.

Similarly, beating creationists by a full step. Not all atheists are liberals and not all atheists support gay marriage (I do, though). Atheists are not morally superior than theists. Scientific literacy is not exclusive to you.

To say that ""atheism"" is the opposite of religion is ""false dichotomy"", for a grand total of a whole TWO FUCKING CHOICES. You have many more than two choices.

You can be an irreligious atheist, those guys that *don't* equate atheism with irreligion). Or you can be a religious theist (Christians and the like) or an irreligious theist (Deists). That, and atheism/theism are totally different ideas than religion/irreligion.

So, the teacher has made it clear that she is supposedly very well-versed in music. She said we could contribute to what was being played, so I spent days stressing over making the perfect compilation. Everyone has their obsession and this is mine, with Dylan in particular. Have you ever had one of those silly daydreams of showing your favorite stuff to the class and feeling cool for a day? I've been thinking about wanting to do something like this for years. 

What happened

Well, try to do so on a big screen in front of the entire class?.... So you see a large part of the source of my frustration. The biggest problem, however, was that she had nothing prepared.

*Nothing.*

You and I both know that you *can't* do that with youtube. Finding things on youtube is a science, even though VISUALS DO NOT A GOOD PIECE OF MUSIC MAKE. She said that she wanted there to be visuals to make it more interesting, but we aren't fucking 3rd graders. 

The result? 


**The Who**: I'm pretty sure they were all drunk. Roger didn't hit a single note and stuttered half the song. Extremely early video, you look like idiots.


**The Velvet Underground**: In her quest for a live version

In terms of 60s music I *know* my way around youtube. I tried to point her to a proper video but she didn't listen.  You know


**Joan Baez**: Horrible quality Blowin' in the Wind. Static was loud enough you could barely hear her sing. She stopped it a minute through because it has ""soooo many verses"". When it was over she said ""Hmm I think maybe Dylan wrote this but i'm not sure"" NO FUCKING SHIT SHERLOCK I THOUGHT YOU WERE A TEACHER ON THE 60S. I might give you a pass on a more obscure song
I told her that she could look up Newport Folk Festival videos that were great quality and she said ""But it's been going on until now even so we probably can't find stuff from the 60s"" and didn't take my advice. WHAT THE FUCK. Type in the year

**Janis Joplin**: She looked for a live video for at least 5 minutes. It was painful to watch. She got fooled by the same still video 3 times, so we kept seeing the Velvet Underground video again. Every time it happened she got extremely flustered and spent 15 seconds trying to figure out wtf just happened and how to undo it. I don't even know what was going on in the video that was eventually chosen. What she was doing on stage looked like a cross between a seizure and someone getting a bukkake. (singing included.) 

**Peter

**Jefferson Airplane**: Now, BAM! It wasn't complete shit, but there are some songs that are so  mind-bendingly perfect on the album, you're doing the song an injustice if you try to introduce people to the song through the live version.

**Jimi Hendrix**: We watched him do the pre-song making-weird-noises-with-the-guitar

She didn't use our playlists/requests at all.

1329022874.0,plpoh,My problems with some people's justifications of subreddits about children being depicted in a sexual way (Part I of II),RantyFace,16,1,6,"Certain comments I've seen have been frustrating

* 1) ""I can’t believe you people would want to censor something just because it’s not agreeable. They have a right to Free Speech."" - This has nothing to do with free speech or censorship. Reddit is a privately owned website. If the government came in and censored images or FORCED Reddit to take down certain subreddits

* 2) ""They're just looking at pictures."" - Part of making the transition from fantasy to reality is normalizing the idea and practice. You start small, lead to violence against other humans. In addition, the images have to come from somewhere - yes, some are taken from facebook, others from professional studios, etc where the original intent was not sexual. This does not mean that ALL the content was taken with innocent intention and then recontexualized. 

* 3) ""It's not illegal if there's no nudity."" - Actually, **even without nudity**, depending on content, context, and where the focus of the image is. Look up [The Dost test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_test) used to determine whether or not an image of a child is pornographic. Some of the criteria are:
&gt;    1. Whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genitalia or pubic area.
   2. Whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive
   3. Whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose
   4. Whether the child is fully or partially clothed
   5. Whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity.
   6. Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

* 4) ""If you shut it down, and someone suggested that the owners of the building keep an eye on that room, report people in that room to the authorities if they actively discussed engaging in child abuse in a positive or premeditative manner, or maybe close it down altogether, would your argument be that ""Oh, they'll just find another room"" or ""They'll go meet in another building.""? You'd be okay with their activities going on unhindered because your assumption is that if they're stopped, they'll just go somewhere else? How does that make it right? Again, but being in a social setting (virtual or otherwise) where they can find support and camaraderie. 

* 4a) “If you take away a place to view pictures, if not most, pedophiles target children they don’t know through picking kids up in playgrounds, kidnapping, and of course the old cliché of the ‘windowless white van.’ This isn’t true. The majority of child abuse victims are easy access - family members or acquaintances. A [2001 study by Abel and Harlow that interviewed 4,007 adults ages 18-95 who had admitted to committing child abuse](http://www.yellodyno.com/pdf/Child_Molestation_Prevention_Study.PDF) found that 90% of their victims were children they knew, with 68% being family members, the chances are that their victim is already in reach. Creating an environment where they can fantasize/normalize their desires does not help the problem. The same study found that abusers who fantasize/maintain fantasies - 41% of overall abusers - had more than three times as many victims.

* 5) ""Oh, and have reached (hopefully) a point in their life where they are physically and mentally mature enough to understand what they are doing. **Children are not.** Being aroused by someone of the same gender/in a fursuit/by being tied up/etc doesn't involve victimizing someone who doesn't understand what's going on. If you like to sniff shoes while getting off, sure, some might find that weird - but a subreddit about sniffing shoes doesn’t create a venue for fantasizing about/normalizing children being sexual, even if in fantasy form only. You cannot equivocate adult/adult sexual fetishes or acts with adult/child fetishes.

You separated when I was 11, so thanks a lot for that.

Dad specifically: fuck you SO much for all of the times you've made me feel like a worthless piece of shit. You don't call your daughter skanky/stupid/ugly/useless for most of her life and then magically get to try to work shit out when she's 22. I've forgiven you and have tried to be civil, fat mouth of yours. Consider my feelings... please. You went ape-shit when mom left the first time. Threw things around, swore, broke my stuff, wrote obscenities on our boxes on moving day, blamed me then apologized then blamed me then apologized... you were a miserable fuck. I never wanted to visit you because all you did was question me about what mom was doing. As an 11 year old I had to hear a lot of stuff about you and mom that I didn't need to know. Remember that time you took advantage of mom while she was drunk in Florida? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YOUR KIDS WERE IN THE ROOM? Luckily your son was asleep... but I heard everything. Why do you wonder why I have terrible anxiety? It should be obvious.

Mom: You have to stop drinking. I'm so tired of seeing you wasted... you have no idea. Your face is starting to show that you're an alcoholic. You're so cranky when you're not drinking. I miss my mom - the old one - who didn't need alcohol to survive. Some days I almost wish you weren't such a functioning alcoholic so that the people around you would *have* to stop and say something... maybe it would make you face reality.
You push everyone away. You don't have any friends anymore. The ones that you do have, but isn't that completely material!? What about your sanity???
What about your son? He still has to put up with this shit first hand - I'm lucky to live on my own. 

Both of you need to get help. Both of you need to move on. I don't know why you got back together in the first place! Dad fucking sleeps in the basement, the only thing I ever wanted in life was a dog. I was always told that we were too busy and too poor to afford a dog and that it wouldn't be fair. Well imagine my disgust when dad called me up two years ago to tell me that you guys were getting a puppy after I was no longer living there. He later told me that the only reason he got one was to keep mom around. Fast forward to now: you're STILL too poor and busy to have a dog, so she remains virtually un-trained, has anxiety issues and bit my grandpa so badly he needed stitches. She could be a good girl if you would just give her to a family that would be willing to TRAIN her. She's a German Shepherd for fuck's sake... she's going mental without a recognizable authority figure in the house. Oh, and mouse traps in the plants and on the furniture are NOT proper training methods. Neither was skipping out on a crate because you thought it was cruel and instead barricading her into the kitchen. YOU'RE BOTH SO FUCKING STUPID!

Also

Dad, ""I'm glad we patched things up... 'cause you used to be crazy"" my heart sank. I didn't say anything because the only thing that would have come out of my mouth would have been mean. I'm trying to maintain a decent relationship with you but you make it awfully difficult. You've never really known me despite watching me grow up.

1372346457.0,1h6kzv,American Airlines Sucks,dak0tah,17,4,0,"My most recent trip with American Airlines was absolutely awful. I was booked on 8 different flights at different times, jerked around, adding a happy ending to an otherwise tragic tale.

My 8:45 AM flight was delayed again and again with no information given. Eventually, still had to pay out of pocket. I was then told that the American Airlines help desk was outside of security and they could help me with more details so I left the secure area of Austin Bergstrom and was again told basically nothing, if the flight was cancelled officially, I could check back. Then I tried to go back through security but my mobile boarding pass had been cancelled so I had to go back to check in at the AA desk where they still gave me no information other than that there was another flight later if this one was officially cancelled and sent me on my way with a paper boarding pass that I couldn't help but think was a monumental waste of paper. I'm a very environmentally conscious person so this was a little infuriating. In the hubbub of the security line, I somehow lost an insert to one of my shoes.

I now found a comfy place to sit and wait for about an hour and a half, this was shockingly to my dismay. I went and stood in another long line at a terminal and, upon showing the rep my ticket, she, without my verbal consent, just tossed me onto the then boarding plane to Dallas, telling me I'd have a connection from there to Chicago tonight. Apparently the initial flight was finally cancelled for technical difficulties. Based on the times she said

That flight was uneventful, when we got to Dallas, we were greeted by an array of uniformed soldiers in the terminal, something that made me rather uncomfortable, especially with their demeanor and attitudes. I have much respect for the military but they did not make good representatives of our nation's Army. Furthermore, the entire terminal was crowded with a gaudy memorial to dead soldiers. It was cheap and tasteless, failing to convey the seriousness of the situation. I am not often offended.

When it was time to board the connection, something I appreciate for the fact that I like my carry-on luggage near me, I was now, because AA's plane was in disrepair, shafted to boarding group 4. This trend would continue for the subsequent 5 planes I was eventually booked on at one point or another during my trip. If you have to delay someone like you did me, at least have the decency to give them a ticket as good as the one they paid for. The plane was full, loading was difficult and awkward, taxied to the runway, the Captain kept saying we would either depart or go back soon, but then we reboarded

When we got off, as well as put in a hotel for the night. This was a nice token, aside from the back that I was booked for a 7:45 AM departure and the only guaranteed shuttle I could get back from the hotel was at 6:15. I got to the hotel around 9:30 or 10 PM, so, after settling in, I got maybe 5 hours of sleep. But I made it to the gate just before 7:20 boarding. Well, after waiting a bit, a city I knew and loved, an effort to keep me satiated by at least putting me on a plane. Additionally, etc if not for the further poor planning of an AA representative. Simply unacceptable.

This last flight, and I was running out of money. I hate to consume airport food in general, I'm usually very particular about my diet, but this entire mishap had me grubbing out much to my own disgust. Also, this last flight was way too cold, it was freezing, I didn't ask but I was not offered a blanket.

A few things to add, I had middle seats with aisles, adding insult to injury. These numerous and persistent delays not only cost me an entire day or more's worth of work (I freelance), but I also missed a date with my girlfriend and troubled the people who were to pick me up at the airport by convoluting their schedules with misinformation for two days. The entire voyage took 27 hours longer than the initial 3 hour direct flight time I had paid for. This is simply unacceptable and has severely tarnished my perspective on air travel. It is not the lost time that I lament but the entire experience of inaccurate AA representatives coupled with excessively rising false hopes and expectations.

This morning I brought up the topic of money to my girlfriend, and right then I had to draw the line of what a boyfriend should be expected to pay for (food and alcohol) and what she should be expected to contribute to (concert tickets). The argument ended because we both said what we needed to say, but we haven't talked to each other since.

Then, along with some sticky notes of things he wanted to make sure gets done. Now, I'm a clean person (and he isn't), I ended up cleaning our kitchen/living room the night before. So 2 pledges come over and I'm like 'yeah just follow these instructions, heres the stuff you need, clean the living room' and they did an ok job but left after no more than 15 minutes, saying 2 more will be on the way. The next 2 pledges come, throw out a heavy ass retired server sitting in my room

So I get back from the gym and my roommate calls me (who has yet to even see the work they did) and bitches at me for making them clean my room and not the kitchen/living room/his room. Now, which he wasn't cool with). So I'm not gonna go into his room at all, yet he's pissed off at me because 'i took advantage of an opportunity at someone elses expense'. They did everything that was written down on the sticky notes he made, and the place is clean, but he's mad at me because the last 2 pledges were doing things in my room and not the (already clean) kitchen and living room.

Essentially I called about an order on a Thursday asking if I ordered it with one day shipping that it would be delivered by Saturday. The person I spoke with never mentioned the fact that they (Zazzle) have an agreement with UPS and FedEx to not deliver on Saturdays. In fact

So, surprise surprise, come Saturday and no delivery. Soo eventually Monday around 6PM the sweatshirt gets delivered. It is the lightest, thinnest, lowest quality sweatshirt I have ever bought. It would cost $20 or less at any given department store. This shit would not keep you warm in 50 degree weather, let alone the fact that it is now December and I live in Upstate NY. The logo looks like it was printed in 1990 and faded for about 20 years. And oh did I mention that it was my anniversary on Sunday? The day I wanted to give my girl the sweatshirt. Cause ya know being a day late on things like that is ok, especially when i paid TWENTY FIVE FUCKING DOLLARS for one day shipping.

Call customer service and I get some asshole who tells me I am wrong and that I am a liar for saying their customer service person would tell me that. Then when I ask for my money back, and ONLY THEN, will they refund my money. FUCK YOU ZAZZLE!

1346442090.0,z5g75,A Vitriolic Rant About Facebook Timeline,Zapmeister,14,3,2,"Since the dawn of mankind, the Internet, to put it bluntly


Let's get straight to the point. The first most striking thing is that Facebook Timeline is as ugly as a solenodon. (That sounds like Céline Dion. And looks like her too.) In fact, disorderly fashion. There's no obvious focus in the same way as the old Facebook profile neatly listed things. And when you hit F5, the speech bubbles randomly rearrange themselves by jumping across the line from one side to another. LOOK AT ME, I'M A STUPID SPEECH BUBBLE THAT BEHAVES LIKE A 3-YEAR-OLD WITH ADHD WHO HAD TOO MANY E-NUMBERS FOR BREAKFAST SO I'LL JUST JUMP AROUND EVERYWHERE ON THIS GODDAMN PAGE, OK? Oh, and the line itself is completely pointless. It's just this stupid blue line down the middle of the page. It doesn't even stand out. Hooray for that.


So now people can access all my old posts at a glance instead of having to click on ""Show Older"" a lot of times and wait for stuff to load. Thanks for invading our privacy, seriously. Other people will either (1) look back at their own timeline and go ""WHAT THE HELL? I DID NOT FLIRT WITH TUTANKHAMUN AT 'THE PYRAMID CLUB' IN 1324 BC!"" or something equally implausible (and presumably have the common sense to change their privacy settings), or (2) have their friends point it out to them (even worse). Dear facebook, some bits of history are better left untouched. What is even more ironic is that posts that other people make on your wall are now gathered together and hidden in one hard-to-find speech bubble at the corner of each year's section on timeline, instead of listed together with the rest of the wall as they formerly were. So like it's going to reveal all MY embarrassing old stuff while sneakily hiding everything everyone ELSE posts? Amazing.


What else? Oh yeah, I have the right to refuse to convert to it. Even if I deactivate Facebook, when I reactivate it again it's still going to convert my profile to this stupid rotten layout. There is no point trying to brainwash me into thinking it's a good idea by saying it's an EXCITING NEW KIND OF PROFILE!!!1!!1!one!eleven!tan(pi/4) and calling it an ""update"". You know that's the sort of rhetoric that computer viruses use too. Facebook, make up your mind. There is NO POINT in changing the look of your website every few months just as we get used to the last change. It's a website profile, NOT A FASHION STATEMENT. We can already customise our profiles ourselves. We don't need you to do it for us like we're 6 years old and still need parental guidance on how to do art homework.


This rant is now longer than my UCAS personal statement, but posts from others are hidden in a little speech bubble in the corner which is retarded. And lack of activity really shows up. If you're a page owner who hasn't posted anything in a while, your page now has a BIG BLANK SPACE at the top with: &lt;Month Name Here&gt; People who like this: 2 (in ENORMOUS FONT) People talking about this: 1 (in ENORMOUS FONT) or something like that. How minimalist! Isn't that great? Er... NO.


Furthermore, thanks for that, I'd rather have them in alphabetical order instead, I'm not going to trust your stupid algorithm that changes its mind every 2 seconds and also thinks I could be best friends with someone just because I had a poke war with them three months ago, OK? (For those who share my anguish, there is a very non-obvious workaround. You have to allow subscribers, then go to your About page


I want to be very clear that there is considerable difficulty in writing this too harshly. This is very hard to overstate. The full implications of this need to be understood. Facebook Timeline is not a minor mistake. It is not a simple slip-up. It is a major, the website itself now has a long way to climb until it is to be considered aesthetically acceptable, let alone decent. And if Facebook's graphic designers have any shred of humility or sanity, now is the time for them to step back and reconsider how their collective artistic sense and common sense could have failed to such an apocalyptic degree.

We went around, then it escalated. The usual banter, tickling, I fed her a couple sweets, all that business. It was pretty much a date at this point. Obviously, there's only so much flirting two people can do, so I walked her home. I gave her a hug goodbye
way, I can't do this with you, I value your friendship too much"".

I was crushed; we both had feelings for each other

When I got home and calmed down, she lost me as a friend.

It's a prestigious world

I know this post is somewhat depressing and I don't mean to bring down anyones day the thing is: I love school.
I love the concept.
It's beautiful I think educating people and gaining more knowledge will give you more power and give people more unity and skills to work together and actually make some concrete changes in the way we live out life.
What is here in America though
I never knew all it took was one sheet of paper to tell me I can do things with my hands

Why waste a good 4+ years of your life to only go through on the job training? Why need training
We need some re-defining of what education is. I'm sick of America being so ignorant that they're eating their own shit.

That sort of person should never be allowed within pissing distance of a university. 

The university should not have to go on a lockdown because Random Idiot A brought 10 of his boys from back home to a campus function and one brought a gun. When an attempted double-homicide happens 500 feet from a dorm the university should maybe do something other than release a mass-text the next day that most people don't even get.

Welcome! You are now chatting with 'Representative 1'

Customer: Hi

Representative 1: Hello Bob! Congratulations for getting a new phone! :)

Customer: thank you. It's very nice

Representative 1: Let me check on why this happens whenever you connect online on it.

Representative 1: I am happy to hear that. It's really a nice phone Bob. :)

Customer: This is the first LTE phone on my acccount

Representative 1: I completely understand you. Let me take a moment to check your account further for this.

Customer: no problem

Representative 1: I did notice that the phone being used on the 617XXXXXXX is not being recognized properly which can be causing you not to have the LTE service work on it.

Customer: Interesting. How do I fix that? Or is it an issue of AT&amp;T not (yet) having a configuration for this particular phone?

Customer: I.e.

Representative 1: May I ask for the IMEI of your phone?

Representative 1: You can get this by dialing *#06# on your phone.

Customer: sure

Representative 1: Let me check if your phone is already registered with AT&amp;T.

Representative 1: Sure! :)

Customer: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX / 01

Customer: I had to bring it in to trade my SIM for a microsim

Customer: But I don't know if they did anything beyond switch out which SIM was registered to my account

Representative 1: Thank you!

Representative 1: I understand you Bob

Representative 1: I do see that AT&amp;T does not have the configuration for your phone yet.

Customer: ok

Representative 1: Let me partner with my superior and see what we can do about this.

Representative 1: One moment please.

Customer: sure

Representative 1: Thank you Bob. :)

Representative 1: Thank you for your patience.

Customer: no problem

Representative 1: Mind if I ask where did you got your new phone Bob?

Customer: directly from Google.

Customer: This is the ""google edition"" of the SGS4

Representative 1: Thank you. I will partner you with our technical specialist to see what we can do to have the LTE work still on your new phone Bob.

Customer: ok

Representative 1: You're welcome! What else can I help before I connect you through?

Customer: that's it

Representative 1: You're welcome Bob. Thank you for being patient with me about this.

Representative 1: Kindly stay on this chat. Thank you!

One moment while I transfer the chat to a representative that is better skilled to handle your concern.

Welcome! You are now chatting with 'Representative 2 '

Representative 2 : Hi Bob

Customer: Very well

Representative 2 : Good

Customer: That's right. Signal is right now HSPA:10

Customer: I have not gotten LTE at all with this phone (at least not that I've noticed)

Representative 2 : Let me check coverage in your area--LTE may not be available.

Representative 2 : Is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Customer: yes

Customer: Though I am in downtown Boston right now

Representative 2 : Ok

Representative 2 : I do show LTE coverage in the area.  Do you have call or network restrictions on?

Customer: Nope. ""Data enabled"" is on

Customer: APN is ""ATT Phone"". It's the only option.

Representative 2 : Do you have airplane mode and wifi off?

Customer: Yes.

Customer: Just for reference

Representative 2 : I understand.  :)   We can troubleshoot if you like.  You're not getting any error messages?

Customer: Nope

Representative 2 : We can file a case to get this resolved.

Customer: ok

Representative 2 : It's on my end--let's try a couple of things before we do that.  Please power off your device and let me know when it's off.

Customer: ok

Representative 2 : Bob

Customer: That's right. It's a device directly from Google: it's the Google Edition Samsung Galaxy S 4.

Customer: As the prior rep said to me

Representative 2 : Then

Customer: The other rep transferred me over to you presumably so you could file some kind of ticket to create a configuration for this phone so it could be activated for LTE. I don't really know

Customer: Lots of people are going to be activating this phone over the coming weeks

Customer: There are a lot of people talking about it on xda (the mobile developers' website)

Representative 2 : The device you have is not recommended or supported by AT&amp;T

Customer: You can help by getting it supported for LTE. I should get LTE speeds if the device I'm using supports LTE

Representative 2 : Your device is not an AT&amp;T device so we don't guarantee LTE for it.  I apologize for any inconvenience.  :)

Customer: It's not an issue of ""guarantee"". It's an issue of your network refusing LTE access to the device. There is nothing I can do on my end to get it to work: it's entirely a configuration thing on your end. All I'm asking is that you flip the switch that says this phone can connect to the LTE network. I'm paying a premium for the AT&amp;T network

Representative 2 : You will need to get an AT&amp;T device

Customer: It is the same phone you sell as the 1337, same radio, same everything. I'm not sure what AT&amp;T's objection to activating LTE support for it is: it would be like Verizon telling me if I connect a Mac to FIOS that I only get 5Mbps instead of 60Mbps, and that I'd have to use Windows to get higher bandwidth. There's no technical justification for the limitation.

Representative 2 : That's company policy--I apologize for any inconvenience.

Customer: Anyway, but given my customer service experience I would jump to another provider without hesitation should I have the opportunity. There's simply no reason for AT&amp;T to treat their customers like this.

But wait there's more! I specifically listed that I wanted to work at least 30 hours a week, and when they said I should've said it in my interview I said I did. They stared at me blankly again and said, ""Oh we'll fix it then."" And now I'm only getting scheduled 1-2 days a week. And several times I've been sent home early because ""They have too many people.""

Oh and this goes with my last point but so far this pisses me off the most. I had to go to a funeral last weekend when, which she said was fine. But since our scheduling manager wasn't in, we left a note. I checked back the next day to make sure he got it and I was good to go. And then my manager said that we couldn't switch because ""It wouldn't be an equal trade because she does different things."" To be fair, I mostly work up front while she works drive-thru, but we've both worked the other without too many problems so I don't really see how that was a valid excuse. When I said why I couldn't go to work and that I'd really like to switch shifts or at least pick up another so I don't miss out on money, they insisted it'd be fine if I didn't show up. And then the next day when I came in to check the schedule for the next week, they apparently changed their mind, so I went off thinking everything was settled. Oh how naive of me. While I was at the funeral reception (which is a good 2 hours away) I received a phone call, remember?"" ""Oh yeah. We wanted you guys to both come in."" What? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of switching shifts? ""When did this happen? Today."" Well no wonder I had no clue, am I supposed to be a goddamned psychic? Well obviously I couldn't drop everything and go to work on a day I was supposed to have off

I mean, and a student and I clearly told you when I can't work, but no, apparently unless I have nothing better to do but work I get my hours cut to the point where I make peanuts. And fuck you for lying to me about my pay rate, if you didn't want to pay me that much than say so, don't wait until after I've accepted the fucking job to tell me you're going to pay me less. It's not like that money would've gone to good use, like helping me become financially independent so I wouldn't have my parents breathing down my neck anymore.

1373598152.0,1i4n7x,10 Reasons why Astrology is stupid.,FozzieThaBear,16,6,8,"Someone once said that Astrology is about as vacant as the space that it worships. Here are some reasons why:

1. The stars in a constellation are sometimes thousands of light-years apart and the connection between them is arbitrary.

2. When you were born your obstetrician had more gravitational effect on you than any planet or star in the universe. 

3. There are 13 constellations in the Zodiac (not 12). The 13th is Ophiuchus.

4. The Zodiac was established around 2000 years ago. Since then the Zodiac has shifted one sign along

5. The natal planet alignment is futile since the time-of-birth is often arbitrarily chosen (i.e. the doctor/nurses may get the hour right
6. Are all horoscopes done before the discovery of the outermost planets incorrect? Planets get found

7. If the planets influence us astrologically why is this influence independent of distance? Mars is sometimes the other side of the sun from us and sometimes it is the same side as us
8. If distances aren't important in astrology, nebulae and black-holes?

9. Why do horoscopes of the same zodiac sign in different newspapers differ so much?

10. Why is the moment of birth
nd if not then why do premature babies not have different star-charts than non-prem babies born at the same time on the same day?

Preface: I am 19 years old

I am nearing my wit's end. I am nearing explosion. I am nearing just fucking going off

I get that I was lax on the job front the past few years

I don't suppose you get that I was suffering from some really bad anxiety and depression? Was the fact that I did absolutely nothing social wise last summer besides working give it away? or was it the fact that I was holed up in my dorm room for most of my first year of school that gave it away? Or was it the constant screaming at me last summer because I didn't work enough

Instead of assuming I was being lazy

It killed me that you didn't even begin to think that something was wrong with me. I told you I needed help the winter of my senior year

Honestly

So I get it. I didn't have a 'real' job until April. You have reminded me on numerous occasions. Let. It. Go. Through all of this I have internalized and you just *assumed* I'm fine. I'm not. I am broken. 

So February of 2013 comes around...

""*You need to make plans for the summer for when we're not around anymore.*""

What. the. FUCK. does that mean? So here I am... I have student loans, and you tell me that you *won't be around anymore* and I have to find something to do? I understand that I'm 18 and you do not have go be legally responsible for me... You and my father both have reminded me on NUMEROUS occasions but it would be nice if you made it seem like you actually cared. 

So I make plans to move 1

No. Absolute worst decision

Multiple times a week I was reminded that I needed a job, FUCKING STUPID. DO YOU THINK I ENJOY MY LIFE? DO YOU THINK I ENJOY NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TO MYSELF, BEGGING MY MOTHER TO PUT MONEY BEHIND MY DEBIT CARD SO I COULD BUY MEDICINE BECAUSE I WAS FUCKING SICK AND HAD NO FUCKING MONEY? DO YOU FUCKING THINK I LIKE THAT?

So this continues for months. IT drove me deeper down into depression, what if. I suffered physically. I suffered mentally. I suffered emotionally. I suffered academically, but it wouldn't stop. I was applying for jobs, but without much luck. There was only so much I could do from 1600 miles away. I understand that I didn't get a job the summer I lived with you, even though I said I would.

More on that later.

So April rolls around. I've had enough. I'm cracking. I am sobbing every night because of the enormous amount of pressure I was under

Let's break down my college food schedule.

Wake up 8:30 or 9 a.m.

Lunch between 11-1

Want a snack? Oh just hop over to the cafe in the campus center and pick something up with your $150 flex cash.

8 p.m. and beyond... nothing because I had no money to keep snacks on hand. See job part ^

Go to sleep and do it all over again.

I am a person of the night, on average, every 6 months is coming to stay with you, should make you happy enough. Guess not.

So yeah. I ate at night because there was food available. You're trying to lose weight and made me feel awkward for eating a decent amount of lunch so I ate about as much as you did

At school

So anyway

At this point, starts giving me heaping piles of shit of the same shit you gave me about applying for jobs, not sitting around and playing, we are a family that works, blah fucking blah. I FUCKING GET IT. I FUCKING GOD DAMN FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT I FUCKING NEED A GOD DAMN FUCKING JOB. I GET IT. I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID. I AM ACTUALLY QUITE INTELLIGENT. I FUCKING GET IT. I UNDERSTAND. I COMPREHEND. I GET IT. YOU DO NOT NEED TO TELL ME 6 TIMES A WEEK THAT I NEED A JOB, THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, WE ARE A FAMILY THAT WORKS. I. FUCKING. GET. IT. 

She makes the mistake of telling me something among the lines of

Hold up. Red flag on the field. Who the FUCK are you to parent me? You're the bimbo that my father started dating when I was 17. You're right. You are not my mother. You need to stay out of this

I get that you're ""in love"" but you aren't my mother. End of story. 

She gives me shit

So I call my mother, get 2-3 jobs, etc...

I'm seeing the counselor at this point when the phone call happens and I'm sobbing. I am absolutely crushed. I thought that you'd want me to stay

So I am in an absolute panic. I need to find a place to move when school is out, school was done May 9th. 

I spend the rest of the afternoon and part of the evening scouring the internet for roommate ads, absolute panicked. I have such a knot in my stomach, I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't stop being scared, I couldn't stop feeling rejected. I went and sat in the shower stall under the water for 20 minutes and it didn't make me feel any better.

I wasn't going to sleep that night and this was the end of the world for me. Until you sent me that message over facebook. You said that you went off the deepend, but you'd still need a job and paying for shit. 

I feel literally millions times better. 

So I go for the job interview at McDonald's on Monday, but it's a paycheck. I go back to school that night, and the next morning, the best thing happened.

I got the call saying I got the job. That I could continue to live. That I will survive to see another summer. That I will finally get a leg to stand on

So the next month goes about as perfect as it could. I make friends at school playing Magic

I am on Cloud fucking Nine. I have a job

You couldn't muster an ounce of excitement for me. ""Good."" 

Whatever.

So the end of school rolls around, but I'm not going. I have a job here and a family that sort of seems like they want me. 

So the visit ends, delivering Mother's day presents. I'm there visiting with my family, seeing my aunt and her family are in town from New Hampshire. 

We get talking and they say this. ""They were on you so hard about getting a job because the last time you were there

Okay. Stop right fucking there.

Have you not figured out by now that I went to live with you that summer because I pitied you? Because I felt bad for you that you were alone with only your dog. Your russian mail order bride (that's a whole other seperate rant) only wanted a greencard so you sent her back? 

I only said I would get a job so you would agree to this, not to get a job. 

Anyway... 

My work fucks up my hours. I get one shift a week for 2 weeks in a row because when I was hired I told the store manager that I was weekends only until the end of school, so 1 shift a week for 2 weeks. Whatever, I'll live.

I guess...

I am not a physically strong person. I do not like house work or yard work, sometimes I don't, but I offer. 

well apparently that's not good enough for you anymore. So you shut off the internet one morning because you were pissy at me.

No one could ever talk to me or anything. It's all passive aggressive bullshit. 

So fast forward a few weeks later, paying for my own. It is important to note that I got my $225 housing deposit refund that day, too.

So normally ed techs at the school district where my mother works can take smaller pay checks during the year to get pay checks during the summer. 

But not this year and you knew it wasn't going to happen

Your husband, and still you made no preparations.

No savings

You knew this was going to happen.  

If this had happened to me, to go find a job, but I have one. And you don't. 

So I start paying some of the bills

Last Monday, and $100 to YOUR cell phone bill so that you can keep your phones on. You ask me to do this and say that you'll give me some of the money from my car that died and is getting junked. 

So I give you $140.

Friday I ask you if had any money from the car, every insurance bill. So no, quite deliberately I haven't done anything with that check.""

What a fucking cunt shitwad move to pull. You ask me to help you, I do and you pull this fucking horseshit on me. You fucking lying sack of shit mother. Who the fuck does that to their kids who are trying to fucking help them. 

I turned down a shift that day because after working 6 days in a row

I'm not in physical shape 8 hour shifts are hard. Days are long, Tuesday, Wednesday of that week. Excuse me for needing a day off.

So I ask you for your car that night, I wanted to go out, be social and have a little fun. Finally a little success and I get her car. I go play Magic for 6 hours, it was a good night. 

Oh I forgot to mention that I had to turn $20 into quarters to do laundry and you just help yourself to them don'tcha? not thinking that they might. not. be. yours. Yeah

Thanks.

So today

Don't get me started on your husband who couldn't hold a job for a week because he yelled and swore at the project manager because it was shoddy work. You couldn't just think that you NEED the job

So think on this. You need me. You need my paycheck, you start treating me a little better, otherwise I will say no. I will let you fall. You might have to quit smoking and drinking. 

But at least I will have my dignity.

So, that's just fine, you two stay up there and I finally get to spend time with my girlfriend. Well, *it won't fucking work right.* I have to sign in to Xbox live to play OFFLINE SPLITSCREEN. I spend a good 30 minutes trying to set up fucking Minecraft, but can't because my account is locked because I don't give a shit about the stupid thing. So I turn on Forza 4 because the box tells me it has split screen. Well can't play that without the update that you can't download. So I make new accounts AND THAT WORKS! Except I have to play the single player race before I can get to the main menu for split screen. So I play this fucking videogame while my girlfriend is waiting downstairs. When I'm through the goddamn game freezes! Jesus fucking christ. I spent more time trying to get that Xbox set up than seeing my girlfriend. I turn on PBS for sister and I head back downstairs...followed by my girlfriends sister. So we just sit there on the couch trying to watch Johnny Bravo on Netflix while her sister stares at us. It was about 4 hours of just being pissed off and feeling like I was fucking everything up. I just want to see her and talk to her. Her eleven year old sister is not my responsibility. I'm sick of trying to entertain her, paying for her meals, and constantly being stared at. I'm tired of her spoiled and rude attitude. We aren't going to fuck in my house with two of my little siblings and my parents here. Stop sending that little shit. Goddammit. Now I get to sit in my fucking room by myself feeling like shit for being unemployed. Shit just never works.

1371996490.0,1gwq1b,Claiming to love pitbulls does not make you a more compassionate individual.,pitbullsainteasy,24,14,13,"Look

My boyfriend and I have a APBT.  She is a sweetheart... with humans.  Great with other people, because it's the only way to ensure we can control her when going on walks.  Pitbulls are generally horrible around other dogs if not heavily trained from the get go.  Hell, our dog was raised around another dog (she lived with one when my boyfriend was still living with his old roommates), and she is still very dog aggressive.  We can't even own another dog.

And this is why whenever someone exclaims, THEY ARE THE BEST DOGS"", I roll my eyes.  You have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  They are far from the best dog breed.  I have owned and been around quite a few breeds of dog in my time, and pitbulls are by far some of the hardest dogs to own.  They are stubborn as shit, and on top of that, they pretty much abhor other dogs.  So, please, SO LOOK AT ME, I LOVE PITBULLS BECAUSE I'M AN UNDERSTANDING PERSON.  GUYS.  GUYS.  NO

If you get a pit bull

Yes

His sister is 18. His dad works 2 hours away from their house. His mom works 5 hours away from their house. 

Let's begin. I babysit this kid every fucking day. He is spoiled and rude as fuck sometimes, selfish fuck heads I've ever met. And his sister is on drugs but his parents don't give a fuck. They think she's ""sweet and innocent"". Fucking dickheads. 

Lately, his dad called to apologize. ""We'll pay you for your gasoline"" they said. One fucking week later, guess what? NO FUCKING MONEY BECAUSE NO ONE IS HOME. 

Half the fucking time I go over there his fucking parents are sitting there watching fucking tv while I babysit their kid because they don't fucking want to. Where the fuck is his sister? Probably in fucking Timbuktu smoking a joint or some shit. She's never there. FUCKING GO TO WORK AND THEN I'LL WATCH YOUR KID. 

Today

I fucking get there and this kid is nowhere in sight. In fact no one is there

THEY FUCKING TEXT ME ALMOST EVERY FRIDAY NOT TO COME BABYSIT WHICH IS THE DAY I FUCKING GET PAID SO I HAVE NO FUCKING MONEY ALL WEEKEND.
