I've noticed recently that a LOT of people have been confusing Reishi, and provide examples for them.

---

##Reishi
Reishi means ""spirit particles"". Reishi is the thing which objects are made of inside Soul Society and Hueco Mundo. There's also Reishi in the World of the Living

Reishi is essentially the same as Kishi, oxygen, sodium, etc).

**Who Uses Reishi**

Reishi is what Quincies use for all of their techniques. They tear the Reishi out of the environment and combine them with their own Reiryoku to shape it in a certain way. They use their cross as a sort of focal point for the Reishi to easily combine with their Reiryoku
######Quincies can also combine Reishi with their Reiryoku inside their veins to boost their natural abilities (Blut Vene/Arterie).

**Examples of Reishi**
Buildings in Soul Society, Plus bodies, Shinigami bodies, Zanpakuto, Quincy weapons (not crosses - they are made of Kishi), etc.

---

##Reiryoku

Reiryoku means ""spiritual power"" but also relates to ""spiritual energy"". Reiryoku is the thing which Quincies combine with Reishi to create things, Shinigami, and their subraces) has a maximum amount of Reiryoku possible. That amount is more than three times the level of a Captain-class Shinigami, and is most likely the same for all races. This is the reason why Aizen and Urahara wanted to break the barrier between Hollow and Shinigami, as doing so allows for a potential maximum of four times the regular limit.

This is the reason why Ichigo absorbed all of Rukia's Reiryoku when she stabbed him. Her potential maximum is MUCH lower than Ichigo's potential maximum (which is possibly the overall maximum). This is also why he was much weaker when he originally became a Shinigami

It's worth noting that Reiryoku and Reiatsu are closely related. If somebody has a huge Reiryoku pool

**Who Uses Reiryoku**

Pretty much everybody. All spiritual beings anyway.

* Quincies use it to shape the Reishi that they tear from the environment
* Shinigami channel it through their Zanpakuto in Shikai to create attacks. They also shape it in a certain way to use Kido.
* Hollows/Arrancar condense it to create Cero.
* Don Kanonji uses it to create his Kan'onball.

**Examples of Reiryoku**

Heilig Pfeil (partially), Getsuga Tensho, Santen Kesshun, etc.

---

##Reiatsu

Reiatsu means ""spiritual pressure"". Reiatsu, it's often used interchangeably with the concept of ""spiritual energy"", and as a result, Reiryoku. Like I said in the Reiryoku section, Reiatsu and Reiryoku are closely related, but not quite the same.

EDIT: /u/WaterISThirsty explains it best:

&gt; I'm pretty sure that Reiatsu is created through the pressure difference between two bodies with spiritual energy.

&gt; Meaning that by manipulating and/or cutting off your reiryoku emission you can effectively lower your reiatsu because less flow of energy is coming from you body, they are literally feeling the pressure of someone else's reiryoku output.

&gt;**TL:DR** Think air pressure in the atmosphere!

We know that Asauchi can ""become anything"" but after they become a true Zanpaktou they stay as they are for ever - they might evolve, and the shikai + sealed state are just extra layers that form on top of that. Those layers shield the Asauchi from being damaged in battle, at the cost of restricting how much of it's power can get out.

So, as the cost of risking permanent damage.

Damage to the shell in shikai or sealed state can be easily mended, the damage is still there it's just no longer visible. 

So thats why Bankai usually takes decades to achieve - the zanpaktou spirit has to trust the shinigami utterly, so they save it for when they need it. Meanwhile the younger captains generally regard bankai as just a powerup/ultimate attack and don't really think much about using it beyond that (Even if they know the risk involved to their zanpaktou, they probably don't really understand it).

Komamura's 'exception' to the rule also fits - a unique trait of his bankai is that the damage it takes is reflected on his own body and vice versa. So technically the bankai itself never takes damage,,False,,t5_2rk7q,False,,True

We also know that he is essentially banished from Soul Society (not being able to go back



This leads me to believe that Kurosaki is an alias (Possibly a mix between Isshin's previous name and Masaki's name. Also possible that its a mix between Kuro (Japanese for black) and Masaki



What if Isshin was a royal guard, they took a new name (Kurosaki, black masaki, as in Masaki is a black mark on the royal families bloodline, bringing shame and dishonor for running off.)



Now, Kubo hints that Masaki was maybe not killed by the Grand Fisher. The Grand Fisher might of just finished her off when she was injured and the Royal Family sent an Assassin to kill her, trying to redeem their honor. 

However



Kojima has always been the one friend that we have never really explored to deeply. He is also the only friend that we have never seen in trouble or fight along side someone else. This is because he is 
a) Strong
b) Not interested in anything other than Ichigo / Karin and Yuzu's saftey. 



Some other reasons i can see him as a royal guard sent to watch over Ichigo



It's said that the only person Kojima ever really opened up to was Ichigo



It's made clear that he is only interested in ""older"" women. This is mentioned throughout the series several times by Ichigo's friends. We can assume that when asked about love, humans offer him little interest in terms of love. 



When Aizen came to Karakura, especially by throwing the fire bomb. (Did not draw his sword as it could blow his cover possibly.)  



In the character book, but he's actually a ????'. He's actually a what? A Royal Guard? I think so. 



This brings us to the latest chapter with the mystery sword. Since Ichigo was born, Ichigo completly dropped off Kojima's radar. Quickly springing into action, he killed Kirge and points his sword towards Urahara. 



Kojima does not see Urahara as an ally, because he could only feel it faintly, he assumed it was on the low end of the spectrum, but in actuality, Urahara was grasping at the coat tails of his power. His reitsu was so high Urahara could only feel the very edge of it. 



I believe Juha Bach sent Kirge to Hueco Mundo



TLDR: Ichigo is Royal



That's my theory, kind of like Tobi = Ramen Guy, but hey, anythings possible with Kubo. Sorry for any bad English.

We have not actually seen Ichigo's bankai. We've been led to believe that he has achieved Bankai because he constantly says ""Bankai"" and transforms and has increased capabilities, and we know that Ichigo has constantly been rejecting Whitey and trying to suppress him from taking over, no doubt due to Ichigo's belief that Bachgetsu is his true Zanpakuto.

This is why the Quincy could not steal his Bankai. He does not have a Bankai

Or maybe I am wrong. Maybe he has been using his true Bankai and it couldn't be stolen because he is also Quincy. Whitey has always been there

With most arcs of Bleach so far, back at the end of the Soul Society arc.

This arc seems to revolve around the concept of Heaven and Earth. When you think of the heavens, you'd realise that it has two sides to it: day and night. During the daytime, Heaven is ruled by the Sun, and during the nighttime it is ruled by the Moon.

##The Sun &amp; the Moon

The Sun in this arc has definitely been represented by Yamamoto, and it's not too much of a stretch of the imagination. We know he has the strongest fire-type Zanpakuto in Soul Society, and when you think of what represents fire the most, you have the sun.

The Moon, with the Vandenreich representing the nighttime half of Heaven. The moon is well known to not have any light of its own, instead needing to ""steal"" the light of the sun to be visible. Juha Bach literally stole the ""light of the sun"" (read: Yama's Bankai). After doing so, he was immediately ""eclipsed"" by the Earth (Ichigo showed up). In other words, the Schattenbereich (literally Shadow Area or Shadow Region) represents the dark side of the moon; to represent Bach being eclipsed, the Schattenbereich restrained him and forced him to retreat. Furthermore, the Sternritter represent the stars in the sky (Sternritter literally means ""star knight""), and the stars being the lesser lights).

##Earth

Earth in this arc is being represented by Ichigo. Ichigo has, but also Hollow powers (Kugo aside). For a long time there has been a representation of Hollows and Shinigami as opposites with humans in the middle, but if you think about how the worlds and powers are connected to one another, you'd see that Shinigami relate to Hollows in the same way as they relate to humans. Hueco Mundo (literally ""Hollow world"") exists on a plane alongside Earth, representing Earth as it is if it was void of humanity or ""heart"" (basically a ""hollow"" Earth). As such, Earth and Hueco Mundo are on the same level. Then, above the two, which represents Hell (no mystery there).

Ichigo ascended Heaven at the climax of the last arc, which is basically the idea that humans have two sides to them (reason and instinct), and by finding a perfect balance to them a person can become the Ubermensch (literally meaning ""superman"" (the comic book character was based loosely on this philosophy, not the other way around :P)). And then of course, after Ichigo became the Ubermensch he lost his powers, becoming entirely human.

The reason Nimaiya and Isshin have told Ichigo that he isn't a real Shinigami is because he is still the Ubermensch, Ichigo has discovered (and will continue to discover) his Quincy powers, which link him to both sides of Heaven.

Ichigo, Zangetsu quite literally means ""kill the moon"". Ever since the first time Zangetsu's name was revealed, it's been a bit of a mystery as to why it's called ""moon-slayer"", and I feel as though Kubo has been working up to the climax of the series where Ichigo will finally slay the moon.

**TL;DR: Yamamoto is the Sun

The trio that rushed Yamamoto are definitely alive. So

There's clearly more to the letters than simply the unique ability it might name. As theorised by the fandom, what that value seems to go beyond the power - at least that's the subtext I'm getting from both Manga Panda and Mangastream. What it is, however... well, I suspect that would reveal too much at this point, so I'm not expecting clarification for a while.

There's something I've been theorising from the start and it's part of my theory that I'm not convinced the quincies (as a group) are the final enemy, for the first time, we get a very strong indication that these quincies - even the top ranking ones - are not privvy to their emperor's motives and goals. And they apparently don't know everything there is to know about quincies.

There's a stark contrast at work in this chapter when comparing it to the quincy assault on Seireitei. They had data on the shinigami. It's questionable how much they knew about appearances, powers (or at least those who bothered to read the reports did).

Nobody recognises Uryuu. Even when they're told he's the last quincy survivor in the world, they didn't even know Juhabach was planning something like this - given the shock, it looks like even Uryuu's recruitment was a secret until his 'reveal' to the troops. He's a bolt out of the blue, a complete unknown, something that have precisely no information on.

And that is downright bizarre. In fact

Quick aside: last quincy alive in the world/lone quincy survivor in the world. This is either support for the theory that the Vandenreich quincies are dead (leaving the Ishida duo the last living quincies) or it means the quincies withdrew from the World of the Living to a secret location beyond the World of the Living and the Ishida duo are the last quincies left outside the Vandenreich.

So, however, given the question even more intrigue than it originally had. I'm therefore going to move on from that.

Now

Not only is it strange that there's so little knowledge on Uryuu within the Stern Ritter given that the arc has built them up as a very efficient data collectors, the Ishida name means nothing to them. So, who was Kirge? Why did he seem to know more than the Stern Ritters do? What was his place in the hierarchy (and, no, pointing out he was the letter 'J' doesn't answer the question)?

And yet Juhabach clearly knows all about Uryuu. He knew about his existence

And this brings us to the big meaty crunch... the subject I've been banging on about ever since Kirge's fight with Ichigo: Kirge knew about Souken. He knew about Uryuu. He was willing to talk about Souken

It's just happened again, he has to know Uryuu's parentage.

And that means the most likely possibility is that he's just lied through his teeth to the Stern Ritter and, a week or so ago, I posted that there seems to be a deliberate contrast going on between Juhabach and Ryuuken. I even concluded with the comment that the contrast leaves me feeling like there isn't one quincy king, but there's actually two (or, perhaps more accurately, there isn't one person with the power of the quincy king, there's two people with the power of the quincy king). And now Uryuu is Juhabach's successor?

This brings us to an important question: what is really meant by 'successor'? What's meant by 'emperor' for that matter. What is the Quincy King? I have theories on that

The other important question is... why. Why does Juhabach need a successor? What's the limitation on his future that makes him feel he needs to have one. And why the hell is he putting on such a display with a quincy that the story has indicated to the reader is a mixed-blood after the story has also told us that he's engaged in purges of mixed blood quincies and even impure pure-bloods? As red flags go

In short

I don't want to run off into a tangent at this point, there's a big panel of Uryuu's face. And you know what his expression looks like to me? Sad. That does not automatically mean he's not brainwashed, but I think he's there of his own free will. I don't know whether it's the end goal he's hoping to achieve that makes him sad, or the path he's taking to achieve it that makes him sad. But, for someone who longed for so long to be a powerful quincy, who vowed to become powerful to change his father's mind about the quincies, the expression (during a conversation about him achieving his true power) should not be so sad. Yet it is. Solely because of Uryuu's expression

At this point, and Isshin's version of the tale isn't enough for that. It leaves questions. In fact, it raises questions. So I think Uryuu's been told something Ichigo has not been and, as Souken said, what we're seeing unfold is his decision.... what and why, remains a mystery. But suddenly, Uryuu doesn't look so happy to be a quincy anymore.

And then we have Buzby. He and Ikkaku were separated at birth, this raises the flag of the quincies as a group not necessarily being the final enemy, even if the leadership turns out to be. And there's not the indication they serve their leader out of the kind of loyalty that comes from love or respect or worship. They follow out of fear. That's the implication coming across... or at least, a lot of them do. That interesting fellow with the eye-on-a-stick might have genuine loyalty, or he might be the kind to have extreme loyalty from the 'subordinate bully' (remain in the bully's favour so other kids get bullied instead). That's fear, too. The pathetic kind. On top of that, he's spying openly... so not only is there the implication that Juhabach doesn't trust his men, no? Considering the themes

And then we have Haschwalth, are we going to be dealing with him a bit in the future!

First thing to note with Haschwalth - the men assumed Haschwalth would be the Emperor's successor. So, we don't see any claim that Haschwalth himself believed he would be - what we're seeing is that the men assumed that Haschwalth assumed he would be the successor. Haschwalth himself is carefully not letting on what he might or might not have assumed and certainly not how he personally feels about Uryuu. Aren't politics fun?

More important than this, and the kind that's the loyal soldier, who has the respect and loyalty of the men, rather than the fear of them. And this is one of the things that makes this chapter so interesting: we see a the implication that Juhabach has taken Uryuu as his own and is personally grooming him, surrounded by an army that fear, rather love, the emperor and whose first impressions of Uryuu are very, support and loyalty of the men who are getting angry with Uryuu because of their loyalty to Haschwalth. They feel Haschwalth has been insulted

So, and Juhabach did seem to notice. Even then, I felt we needed to know a lot more about who Haschwalth is and what role he's set up to play in this arc. I believe it's even more important now if this chapter's implication is right and that it's truly Haschwalth who commands the respect of the army, not Juhabach.

This is also important for another point: Kubo, too, see my earlier paragraph about the idea of Juhabach wanting a fractured army), Juhabach may even be expecting this. Perhaps he's even counting on it. We'll have to see.

However, either Kubo's lost the ability to be subtle or Haschwalth is going to turn out to be Uryuu's ally. It already seems like Haschwalth has some kind of empathy for Ichigo and if Haschwalth is the key to the army's support for Juhabach, then what Haschwalth truly feels and what his true motives are for supporting Juhabach become very important. Especially for Uryuu. Especially if Uryuu is there of his own free will rather than through 're-education'.

So, and I don't think we're going to learn what 'A' or 'B' represents for quite a while, since there's a lot of mystery surrounding the motives and behaviour of all three men involved with those two letters.

2. When we first meet Hichigo

3. He ain't got a name! http://www.mangahere.com/manga/bleach/v19/c165/23.html

4. Hichigo says he's Zangetsu: http://www.mangahere.com/manga/bleach/v25/c218/10.html

5. ""Part of your spiritual power"". Hichigo never specifies which type. http://www.mangahere.com/manga/bleach/v25/c218/19.html

6. Hichigo calls Ichigo's Getsuga Tenshou an ""imitation""

7. ""Infecting"" Ichigo's sword with Hollow powers causes the sword to break apart and vanish. Hollows and Quincy are polar opposites and cancel each other out http://www.mangahere.com/manga/bleach/v25/c219/19.html

8. Hichigo basically hands over the true Zangetsu here: http://www.mangahere.com/manga/bleach/v25/c220/15.html

9. Finally, like with Ishida and his super special awesome move. But you can get it back again through external means.

Calling it now: there will be a funny scene between Rukia and Ichigo

1. Bleach is on hiatus until the 9th of September
2. This hiatus does **not** mean that Bleach doesn't have long to go. The ""final chapter"" of the Arrancar arc went for 4 years, and has been going on for about 2 years. 9 days can mean anywhere between 1 year and 5. Don't fret!
3. **(Big news!) Every week during the break, but myself and Czeliate on Bleach Asylum will be translating the important parts from Chinese, and I'll share them here.

Hey /r/bleach! 

After a little bit of research, and there are a lot of interesting tidbits that I thought you guys would want to know, since it hasn’t been translated yet.  So, here we go (and sorry about the wall of text; can’t help it):

**Character Relations** [**[Source]**]( http://www.bleachanime.org/forums/showthread.php?t=90538)

&gt; Shinji and Momo

* Shinji met with Hinamori in the 4th division's infirmary. They introduced each other and get to know each other through their dealings with Aizen. Hinamori said she is useless and how everyone is forgetting her but Shinji retorted back by saying everyone cared for her, he said they should work together to bring prosper to the 5th division. Days went by, Hinamori made an excellent recovery and she worked hard as Shinji's newest vice-captain. The way she worked though, reminded Shinji of Aizen. Hinamori felt emotional with that statement. They guessed, perhaps, there was sincerity in Aizen than they would have thought. They thought it was partly their mistake not to know Aizen for who he is. Long story short, at the end of their story, 'Yes

&gt; Hisagi and Kensei

* As many would have thought, he silently reminded himself: ""Those who do not fear their own strength, can never hold their weapons"". His story ended with him visiting Tousen's grave or to be precise, Tousen's friend's grave where Suzumushi is placed.

&gt; Kira and Rose

* Kira was reluctant at first with this newly appointed captain. Rose corrected him that he simply gained his former position in the Gotei 13. Kira had a monologue on how the Captain-commander has changed. He is glad. They had a good talk and Kira was surprised, hated his music so he had to hide his musical instrument. He smiled sadly and wondered where she is right now. She is the one that gave him the push to go on being the captain for the 3rd division back then. He took his hidden violin and melody chimed from his violin. Rose said that, even though he might be a new face to Kira and most of his subordinates, he will try his best to be their captain. Kira then asked Rose to join the 3rd division's inner festival, where they gather the persimmons to make dried persimmons from a single persimmon tree at the backyard and he said yes. Kira is delighted, for he and the 3rd division's only memory of Gin is of that single persimmon tree. He thanked Rose for that. Rose can only smile in the end and concluded Kira is his new muse.

&gt; Urahara, and Central 46

* This novel ties in how the Fullbring Arc is about Chad. Now he's attending boxing class just to protect Ichigo and the town. In a sense since he knows he's not worth to protect him with that kind of strength he had.

* Urahara

* Yamamoto has the word/power within the new C46 because in between finding new members to replace the dead and old corrupted ones

* Urahara felt emotional

* Hacchi stayed in Karakura to control or 'clean' the huge residual barrier left after FKT battle.

* Lisa and Mashiro often went in and out of Soul Society. Mashiro became Soul Society's prominent reporter after rejecting her position as the vice-captain from Hisagi. Hisagi is a try-hard to impress his idol. It was noted by Mashiro.

* Love simply couldn't care less about going back to Soul Society but mostly it was because he couldn't read JUMP anymore in that dusty old place.

* Lisa has a house in Rukongai after her business selling porn magazine boomed. It was called 'Palace of Porn' or something. But she rarely stays in it and opt to live in the Living World.

* Hiyori didn't want to go back simply because she hates Shinigami.

**Additional Information** [(Source; Scroll to Buzz Killington’s update posts)]( http://www.bleachanime.org/forums/showthread.php?t=90538&amp;page=2)

* Komamura is the one that persuaded Yama-jii after Rukia

* Nanao did meet with Lisa. She asked if Nanao wanted her to read for her but she thought Nanao is big enough for that. Cue Nanao hugging her senpai. She's showing a different side of her than when she is with Kyouraku.

* In Rukia's flashback, otherwise he wouldn't have adopted a Rukongai citizen like her, who looked similar to his wife. Rukia decided to become Hisana herself in order to repay him for his kindness until decades later, when she finally learns the truth behind her adoption.

* Therefore, because she knows she has built a deep bond with Byakuya and her appearance no longer mattered, so there is no need to keep the same hairstyle that Hisana has. When Rukia became Vice Captain, Byakuya calls her to his room and presents her a samite box. Rukia then opens the box to reveal a pair of white gloves made with silk, with the Kuchiki clan symbol sewn inside the glove. Rukia soon realized it was custom-made for her. Byakuya tells Rukia that after becoming a Vice Captain, chances of using zanpakuto will be frequent. Her zanpakuto is an ice type so wearing the gloves will prevent her from catching cold or frostbite very easily. Rukia can't help but to take a deep bow to express her gratitude towards Byakuya while holding her gloves.

* The story also mentions that the reason Rukia is able to promoted to be a Vice captain is because of a recommendation from Byakuya. Also in one other part when Rukia finally found a way to regain Ichigo's power and went on to ask for help from all the team, Byakuya noticed her red nose, yet he did not ask what happen. However, when Rukia returns to her room, Byakuya went straight to Hisana's altar, facing the portrait of Hisana and spoke softly: ""should I ask what happened...?"" 

* There is a mention of a scene where Rangiku visits Gin’s grave.

1367532695.0,1dkwa1,"The true nature of ""Soul King"" and Aizen's plan",Leviathanus,92,12,81,"Hello.

I have been thinking about this lately so I came up with a theory.

Let's see the conversation between Aizen and Urahara:

Aizen: ""Urahara Kusike! I despise you! You possess such a great intellect
Urahara: ""A thing like that? You mean the Spirit King? I see. So you've seen it. Without the Spirit King's existence

Aizen: ""That is the theory of the vanquished! Victors must always speak of the way the world should be

What does this mean? It means that Aizen saw this ""Spirit King"" and he learned something about it. Something so repellent that Aizen betrayed SS
During Urahara's line the manga and anime showed Aizen's face and to be honest he has not the eyes of a crazy maniac who just wants to become god. I mean it's friggin Aizen we are talking about. It would be too simple.
There has to be some reason. 
And by the way. I totally agree with Aizen:""That is the theory of the vanquished! Victors must always speak of the way the world should be

My theory is that this Spirit King needs Souls to survive. But it would be too much of a bother to do it himself. So he created SS and told the Shinigami to bring souls to SS. But part of these souls are being send to Soul King. Maybe that's what Aizen learned about and that's why he hated Soul King so much.

And my theory who this Soul King really is: At the beginning of time there were just one type of souls. The ""origin"" of all souls. Due to some ""fluctuations"" some souls merged together and created a much stronger combined soul. This soul separated the rest of the souls into four weaker souls: shinigami
He chose this 4 types because he feared that someday these separated souls merged again into one strong soul and that soul could be a danger to his existence.
Now look at those 4 types. The Shinigami hate Quincy (they were told that because of some conflict Shinigami and Quincy are at war
BUT Aizen saw through this and maybe he even speculated that there was this original ""perfect"" soul. That's why he wanted to break the border between Shinigami and Hollow to create this perfect soul or become this perfect being himself hoping that he will be strong enough to bring this Spirit King down.

I think that Aizen has a second plan. This plan is called Ichigo Kurosaki. He is this perfect soul he wanted to create. The only question is how does Aizen want to convince Ichigo to fight by his site. There comes plan C which i don't know. But Aizen does for sure.

1351681921.0,12e5zv,A pretty radical theory regarding Juha Bach.,besterthanyouare,82,9,36,"Some things that Juha has said have made me wonder about his powers and origin. In chapter 510, by that fact

-pause-

Juha Bach is quotable in both major translations(panda, as in the ideologies of the 13 had shifted. This is further supported by Bach stating that Yama had grown soft after the extermination of the Quincies, and that he used to be a 'demon with the sword'. He talks about how cruel Yama could be to his own men if it meant victory in battle. This cruelty is a quality that Bach has demonstrated with his own subordinates on several occasions. Also, when we see the flashback to Shunsui as a young Shinigami, he is in Yama's room looking at a painting of a man wrapped in flames. Yamamoto says it was a monster that appeared in soul society long ago, when soul society was already in a mess, and made things worse. This is a painting of Yamamoto as he was then. In the next panel, symbolic of Yama turning his back on that side of himself. 

-pause-

The ability of these Quincy invaders to steal bankai is still shrouded in mystery. In order to develop such an ability

-pause

The real Juha Bach has only used an energy sword in battle, a bit too intricate for someone who had presumably fought against him. Reasoning being, I don't think an *enemy* would have said knowledge because they would probably have died to his bankai in battle, especially if Yama was as ruthless as Bach suggests. How else then might Bach know about his bankai?

.

.

.

Juha Bach is a Shinigami.

**The subreddit:** /r/ShingekiNoKyojin

**The mangaka:** Hajime Isayama

**Original run:** 2011 - ongoing

***

**Summary:** The story of SNK takes place in a world dominated by giant humanoid creatures known as ""titans."" These titans generally range from 3 to 15 meters tall, and they create an illusion of peace for humanity. This illusion unfortunately only lasts until the sudden appearance of an unprecedented 60-meter tall titan, who breaks the outermost wall and causes hordes of titans to enter human territory and devour everyone they could get their hands on.

One of the few people who experienced and survived this tragedy was a boy by the name of Eren Jaeger

The story then follows Eren’s journey as he enters the military and joins the ongoing effort to reclaim what humanity has lost.

Perhaps however, being part quincy, has the ability to subconsciously learn from the reishi around him and assimilate that to his own use. We saw this a bit in how his hollow mask matured between every espada fight he engaged in. By fighting hollows, he was absorbing their reishi and subconsciously learning to use their powers.

We've also known that hollows leave imprints on people. This hollow fight is clearly extremely important and would have left a very strong mark on Isshin. Likewise

So when Ichigo was in training with Urahara, imitating two of the most powerful reishi memories he had been exposed to. That would explain why Zangetsu is not quite Engetsu and why Ichigo's early hollow transformations were mishappen creatures rather than the fully-formed vasto lorde that Isshin fought.",,False,,t5_2rk7q,False,10,

Let's start with Hollows and Shinigami. On the surface Vizoreds and Arrancar seem like some sort of handwavey BS conjured up to produce a new threat to soul society. However

Where they differ is the nature they use to materialize their power. In Ichigo's fight with Hichigo, the Shinigami are creatures of heart and use their will to protect to focus their power. However, at their core, both are still souls with riatsu. Therefore, the vizard and arrancar were not transformed so much as they had opened to them the other half of their nature. The analogy would be hooking up a second faucet to the same pipe and turning it on and off at will. The arrancar adopt the zanpakto as the symbol of their adoption of will as a channel and the vizard adopt the mask as a symbol of their adoption of instinct. In a sense, every Shinigami is already half hollow, and every hollow part shinigami

As for his quincy background, is anyone's guess, but I would posit that Ichigo has always been using his quincy powers, if subconsciously. As we know, the quincy collect ambient Reshi and condense it into weapons. Ichigo tends to use his abilities intuitively, so forming this into a weapon would be hard for him. Rather, it's possible that as his riatsu manifested, he fundamentally became more powerful for every fight and why Urahara and Aizen expected him to develop so quickly. 

For the Fullbring, they learned how to apply their abilities directly to reishi rather than relying purely on objects. If this is the case, Ginjo likely realized that Ichigo's heritage lent him the ability to master a fullbring, rather than some chance circumstance of his prenatal care.

So…let me get this straight~ 

Ichigo is half shinigami(Isshin half)/half quincy(Misaki half).

His actual shinigami zanpakuto is a hollow (Hichigo/Shirosaki).

Which means old man Zangetsu is not really Zangetsu (making Hichigo the one and true Zangetsu).

So old man Zangetsu is actually the manifestation of Ichigo’s quincy powers (who just happens to look like Juha Bach/Yhwach from a 1000 years ago) and has been lying about what/who he/it truly is to Ichigo all this time.

Ichigo has basic quincy powers because of his mother (which have been somewhat dormant since he didn’t know about them

Hichigo was telling the truth the whole time about him actually being Zangetsu.

Tensa Zangetsu and Shika Zangetsu are both hichigo

And now for my assumptions…

I assume that the reason Tensa Zangetsu was a younger looking Old Man Zangetsu is because that form is somewhat of a mix of both Hichigo and 1000 years younger Yhwach because Yhwach’s deception over what Ichigo’s power truly looked liked was weakened and started to look somewhat closer to Hichigo’s since the real Zangetsu’s power was becoming more prominent looks wise.

SIMPLY PUT: Pretty much the reason Old Man Zangetsu looked younger in Tensa Zangetsu Bankai mode was because Hichigo (The REAL Zangetsu) was manifesting more making the deception’s of Yhwach weaker and making him appear younger just like Hichigo’s looks (which is basically Ichigo’s looks).

So to finish this I assume that the reason Ichigo’s final Zanpakuto form looks like young Yhwach and Hichigo combined is because it is pretty much that. His final form is still truly his final ultimate form because it is both his quincy and shinigami powers together at its peak which made him pretty much just a god in his own right for that short period of time with both of those super powers together at their fullest and Ichigo becoming one with both of them.

THAT IS WHY ICHIGO’S FINAL FORM DIDN’T HAVE AN ACTUAL SWORD BUT RATHER HIS RIATSU TOOK FORM OF A SWORD COMING OUT OF HIS HAND JUST LIKE HOW A QUINCY MAKES A BOW WITH THEIR RIATSU MAKING IT TRULY THE SUPER COMBINATION OF QUINCY’S RIATSU BASED WEAPON AND A SHINIGAMI’S ZANPAKUTO!!!!!

I really hope I got this all right and this is actually how it works out. Do you agree with me?",,t5_2rk7q,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1frzu3/i_think_i_have_got_this_whole_bleach_540_chapter/

We know that Shinigami purify the souls of Hollows and Quincies exterminate them. It seems like the Quincies are committing genocide

Soul Society is broken. The warrior and noble classes live in comfort while the commoners live in squalor. Rukongai is divided into districts and the vast majority of these districts are slums. Why is there a Hell if SS isn't Heaven? Why does Hueco Mundo exist at all? Most importantly what the fuck is the Soul King? We know Urahara and Aizen have seen ""it"" and understand that whatever it is that SS's existence depends on it. 

We've been invested in SS from the beginning and have come to accept that it is necessary. I believe that Ywhach believes that there is an alternative

We know that there is a Hell, unless Hollows exist because the SK wants them too. The very existence of such a high amount of hollows is a byproduct of his reign. By allowing human souls to digress into hollows it creates a cycle. This cycle keeps the king on his throne. 

There's a reason that Shinigami lack a presence in the human world. The SK wants you to become a Hollow. He wants Hollows to devour as many souls as possible. He needs strong Shinigami to purify strong Hollows. When a Hollow is purified it passes through the SK granting him power before crossing over to become a second class citizen in SS. This is what Urahara meant when he called the SK the lynch pin.

The majority of souls in SS live in a complete shit hole. When they get there they arrive in a place where they can't be with loved ones, but in the small chance they manage, they are rewarded with power beyond anything a human could imagine. Power they are told is essential to protecting the weaker souls. This is bullshit. Shinigami are necessary only because strong hollows are allowed to manifest. How much power does it take to guide a ghost to the afterlife? Why is it so hard to enter the human world? I believe that this process used to be simple and fundamental. The SK created an imbalance in reality by taking the ""throne"" by force and subjecting the rest of the soul's to his will. The SK created the walls between worlds. Aizen couldn't beat him because he was playing into his hand. Aizen created the most powerful Hollows ever. All this did was perpetuate the cycle. To usurp the Soul King you must remove his source of power. You have to exterminate Hollows.  

Hollows devour souls to become stronger. To become stronger they need a place to thrive. Since the rebirth of the Quincy we know that creating pocket dimensions is entirely possible. The Vandereich exists in a separate plane. I propose that the SK created Hueco Mundo to breed strong hollows. When a hollow is purified it is reduced to one soul. The rest of that power is absorbed by the King. Ywhach understood this and created techniques to exterminate Hollows effectively turning off the faucet for the SK. The Soul King reacted to this by granting his Shinigami far greater powers and position. 

Under the leadership of Yamamoto the Shinigami became more powerful than ever. They then declared war on the Qunicies and defeated them

That's as far as I'm taking this. Thanks for reading!


**TL;DR: Hollows are the source of the SK's power therefore the quincy are right to eliminate them because the SK is an evil fuck and SS needs rebuilt from the ground up.**

***What if the Soul Society are the bad guys?***

Think about their society. They have a rigid social class system



And then there's their no-nonsense *annihilation* of the Quincies

Now, until the end of the ""Invading Soul Society"" arc, the Shinigami were the *bad-guys*. During the ""save Rukia"" arc, we repeatedly see the dark side of the Shinigami. Don't you remember how terrible they were when they were the antagonists? The shinigami are arrogant, political, and extremely destructive beings. They allow beings like Mayuri Kurotsuchi to be *captains* (he straight-up slaughtered hundreds of citizens in the Rokkungai to keep the worlds at balance). Yes, there are plenty of good Shinigami too, it's a seriously mixed bag

And then Aizen talked about the ""Spirit King"" as a monster. He and Urahara discuss how it's a necessary compromise, as far as Aizen was concerned, was for the greater good. He believed he had the moral authority and imperative to take down the Spirit King. And the Shinigami did everything they could to protect the status quo. Hell, the only Shinigami Aizen  killed during the entire arc was Gin, even though he easily could have destroyed pretty much everyone. We chalked that up to bad writing, but in the current arc, they're dying one after the next....

Which brings us to the current arc. Once again

Originally, there were the Arrancar to worry about. Now the Arrancar have been taken out, and the Shinigami are getting their comeuppance for their destruction of the Quincies a thousand years ago, but there also seems to be something deeper.

Could we all be rooting for the wrong side?

Now let's get started with Ichigo's powers.

1. Masaki

2. Masaki was most likely attacked by a hollow some time during her Quincy training. There's Ichigo's Fullbring powers.

3. Shinigami powers. Now here's where things get a little complicated in my hypothesis. I don't think it's just a matter of being a child of Shinigami and Quincy blood...in fact, Ryuu wants her to be happy, and he lets her go with him. After all, in 530, he does have that concern about her happiness.

In any case, to which the Quincy responds ""Just trying to one-up you"". Isshin's response: ""Yeah...I get it"". (Earlier in the conversation, Ryuken calls Isshin ""Kurosaki"" and he's surprised, saying that it's first time he's addressed by that name. So 188 chapters later, Kubo reveals the foreshadowing of Isshin taking on Masaki's name D:!!!) 

Anyway, there's the factor of...

**The rain**

It rains whenever this hollow attacks, or at least was imprinted there, and Isshin passed his powers on to Ichigo in order to suppress the hollow from manifesting again. Zangetsu hates the rain, remember? And he'd do anything to stop the rain from falling in Ichigo's soul.

Then Byakuya stabs him through the soul where the Shinigami powers are kept. Shit. Urahara probably figured that it's only a matter of time before that crazy hollow creature returns, he would've just become a regular hollow. No. They treated him as an incredibly powerful and terrible threat. This would very much so suggest that Ichigo IS that hollow we're introduced to. And most likely one of Aizen's experiments.

In chapter 19 we see Ichigo chases Grand Fisher's lure, maybe Grand Fisher injured him), his inner hollow comes out in full force. We also know that Grand Fisher is no where to be seen when Ichigo wakes up, which makes no sense. If Masaki died Grand Fisher would have then killed Ichigo as well. I think it is more likely that Ichigo went berserk, scared off/injured Grand Fisher, and killed his own mother.

Isshin

Let's examine a few facts here

* He is retardedly (not a real word

* Cut down the Grand Fisher in half lengthwise with **one slash**

* Kept up with Aizen **without even using Engetsu's Shikai** form

* [Finger flick against Aizen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdaLYvF6jTY)

* Held back the Kōtotsu inside the Dangai with **sheer reiatsu for THREE MONTHS**

* Has extensive knowledge of Shinigami powers and their Bankai 

    Remember, and training; let alone master it (supported by the fact that he has attempted to learn **Engetsu's supreme power, Final Getsuga Tenshō**, whether he succeeded or not is still unknown)

A quote from chapter 162:
&gt; Only the strongest Shinigami can use it. It is also the ultimate technique of a Zanpakutō. Even the Four noble families

[source](http://www.mangareader.net/94-616-8/bleach/chapter-162.html)

* The Gotei 13 respects him. Remember how he and Urahara convinced ALL the Captains (Including Yamamoto

* He wears a tattered **Captain's Haori**

Now, but let's think outside of the box for a second here.

Let's say that it IS just some sort of Haori replica, that's why they are chosen VERY carefully. And for an ordinary Shinigami to impersonate one would be a great offense (This is traditional Japanese culture, people).

Also

**He got exiled.**

Now

Okay

If he did something against Soul Society, albeit of royal blood).

Now then.....

Let's say you run a big group

But what if we replaced that random asshole with someone significant, am I correct?

I want more flairs, so extremely easy! ( ---  http://imgur.com/3maym ---).


And flairs for all the main characters we all love!

Aizen, because he's Aizen).

.


Gin; Originally thought to be the bad guy, almost everyone loves him (me included).

.


Urahara, a flair consisting of his hat can't really be that hard to achieve?

.


Yoruchi

.


Adding 11 flairs for the Arrancar (0-10) - or at LEAST 0-9 - and one for Urahara and Yoruchi does not seem like it can be that hard.

.


Addionally

A flair for Visored, Vandenreich, Bount (not many likes the fillers, but still) and Quincy (gotta seperate the good-guys Quincy from Vandenreich).



I believe that the flairs for the Espada is mandatory, Ulquiorra and Harribel and a lot have had bigger influence so far than most Captains of the Gotei 13 (My second favorite guy in Bleach is Starrk). And I'm sure there's a few fans out there for people like Nnoitra and Baraggan.


I know we're not that big of a community

What if Ichigo doesn't have all these powers because he's the main character

Lets look at what we know about the different races involved:

* **Quincy** and **Fullbringers** are subclasses of **Humans**. The only thing special about Quincies is their inherent reiatsu manipulation skills while Fullbringers can simply bring out the 'souls' that reside in inanimate objects. They're still mere humans.

* **Vizards** are a subclass of **Shinigami** who have transcended the boundary between Shinigami and Hollow

* **Arrancar** are a subclass of **Hollows** who have transcended the boundary between Hollow and Shinigami

\* A note about Ichigo's Vasto Lorde status: Vasto Lorde refers not to another subclass of Hollows but instead to a Menos' power. As their power increases (by consuming more and more of their fellow Menos) they assume more humanoid shapes (reason for this is unknown). The ones that look almost completely human in form are the strongest and classified as Vasto Lorde. Ichigo's Hollow powers meet or even exceed this criterion. When his Inner Hollow takes full control of his body he transforms into a Menos. During his training with the Vizards his form is that of an extremely high-class Adjucas. It's humanoid in form but it's still much more akin to a beast or monster. When his Hollow assumes control in the fight against Ulquiorra we see that this form is completely different. It is literally Ichigo's body with more violent features (claws and those tufts of fur) as well as a mask. It is about as human as it can get allowing us to assume that Ichigo has reached the same level of power as the Vasto Lordes.

With all this being said

He can access the powers of the three different kinds of souls: Human, a transcendental being, would be at the center of fundamental conflicts between the elements that comprise his very soul.

Hi

SO!

The average /r/bleach user is:

* Male (Only 15% of you are female)

* Between the ages of 18 and 24 (majority of females were the same age)

* Whose favorite color is blue (then green

* Whose favorite posts are (good) theories

* Whose least favorite posts are (shitty) fan art

* Whose favorite captain is [**this gentleman.**](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090414053734/bleach/en/images/b/be/Shunsui1.jpg)

* And whose favorite espada is [**this awesome guy.**](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100407103525/bleach/en/images/0/00/Ulquiorra_Cifer_Number_Revealed.png)

**Now let's talk about some changes I saw suggested.**

* A good majority of you (probably 60-70% or so) requested more tournaments. So I've begun putting together a roster for a Low-Tier Tournament. Fraccions, etc. Look forward to a post from that, kinda unsure about a few people, gonna run some by ya.

* Someone else suggested we add spoiler tags like /r/naruto has. We already have them

* Somebody else answered ""Rape"" for every question. Please seek help.

* One person did option up something I thought was interesting. I noticed a good spike in Novelty Accounts recently

* Another cool idea was a weekly discussion thread with a random topic. Could be ""what if"" scenarios (What if Ichigo never used Mugetsu? etc.) Just a what do you think would happen sorta thing. Just tell me what you're interested in

* Also got requests to recruit more users. Now I have no idea where to even begin on that. I don't think a community of 5

* Also got a request to stop the same questions re-appearing over and over. So in light of that, misconceptions, general lore, and manga chapters/anime filler episodes. Anything else you want added? Lemme know.

* People suggested rotating banners. I personally like the banner, but if somebody makes one I'll implement it. Unless you want me to make it. In which case, don't expect a lot, but I've gotten a little bit better at photoshop. And when I say ""a little bit better"" what I mean is, I've figured out how to work the layers aspect of it. Huzzah for small successes!

* To the person who askd us to take down the banner and side bar image so it doesn't look like he/she's browsing at work: go to Preferences &gt; Display Options &gt; and then unclick ""allow reddits to show me custom styles."" That should give everything the default reddit look. I'm pretty sure anyways.

That's all the ones that stuck out to me. If I missed yours and you thought it was good comment here or PM me and we'll talk it over!

Today's manga is kinda well known and old

Today's manga of the week is **Samurai Champloo!**

Now you may be thinking to yourself ""Synyster, but for good reason. It's an awesome show, and if ya haven't watched it already: **DO IT.** It's on Netflix for those of you that have it.

***BUT!***

Did you know the manga has an alternate story line? They go do different things. It's like an extended adventure for those of you who watched the anime! For those who didn't I'd recommend watching the anime first.

So for a quick overview:

Written by Shinichirō Watanabe in 2004, and [Fuu](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120621040933/champloo/images/b/ba/Fuu.jpg) as they traverse Edo Japan to find a Samurai who smells of sunflowers. Mugen and Jin meet by trying to kill one another in the restaurant Fuu works at. After being locked up and tortured, Fuu helps them escape from their execution. And after a long talk and a coin flip, they reluctantly leave with her to help her find this samurai who smells of sunflowers and decide to put their fight to the death on hold.

And there's an episode where they all get really high. A couple

Also please be sure to be nice and say hi to the mods of /r/SamuraiChamploo while they're here hanging out, why dontcha go over and check out their subreddit too! :D

Think about it
So far we have Zan, and now possibly something to do with the Shinigami Uniform (and ""exceedingly expensive"" Captain haoris?).  
  
Any thoughts?  
I mean it makes sense that she invented something to do with the uniforms, and they did make Kenpachi's eyepatch.. The way he appears to be sheilding Nanao (though it may just be stylized), and the fact he has moved on to becoming the CC... Well, I like to speculate.

Few things

* If Aizen knew all along who Isshin Shiba was

Ichigo was a test subject

* What if the whole final fight was a test? Why was there no anger, that even Hogyoku couldn't. Maybe and maybe not, Hogyoku was in the godly dimension.** And if even Hogyoku couldn't beat something he created, something that right now is at peace and at the peak of his powers - he's never going to lose. Maybe it's not the Quincy, that'll be his final opponent...

* There is something serious going on at the backstage, as he ""analyzed the water in the Blood Pond Hell"" That's how he probably also created Hogyoku. Or was he send there, because he created it?

Zangetsu contacted Ichigo already. And I mean the sword, the ""inner Shinigami""

* As Zanpaktous are essentialy ""hollows"" (Heh

* [I think this is the moment he's talking with the true
Look at the last panel, and desired Ichigo to protect from.](http://i25.mangapanda.com/bleach/221/bleach-13695.jpg) ""Did i say you need a reason, for battle?""


Hollow also tried to teach Ichigo something. He played the role of Asauchi. It's the same basis

* [Doesn't that remind you of something?](http://i21.mangapanda.com/bleach/523/bleach-3846763.jpg) Like let's just say, making him the one which pushed his evolution even further. (And since he was a soul from the depths of Ichigo himself, he ""mastered"" Zangetsu earlier because there were no shackles. The real power of Zangetsu at that time, [can be seen here, as it's just a single ""Getsuga Tenshou""](http://i8.mangapanda.com/bleach/219/bleach-1589281.jpg) And now compare it [to Ichigo's Getsuga](http://i35.mangapanda.com/bleach/219/bleach-1589274.jpg). Another reason why i believe that is true, it's the color of Getsuga. Whenever Hollow powers were involved, the texture of the reiatsu was black. Why was this Getsuga white then?

Yeah, lightning conjuring, earth shaking abilities; she just has monstrous strength and fighting prowess.


It makes total sense. If you come to think of it


Zaraki Kenpachi stated that she was the only one he admired, Unohana, never used stupid, pretty, flashy kidou shit; she just owned.


Unohana, that during the past, our lovely but crazy Unohana Retsu would go on a rampage; sometimes hurting a lot of people that were not meant to be hurt. This in turn angered (or at least affected) Tenjirō, leading him to heal the innocent people that Unohana hurt. Finally getting to the point where he, himself, forced Unohana to learn how to heal by teaching her; so that Unohana may heal those she hurt.

It always seemed like such a discrepancy that Ichigo beat Kenpachi before achieving Bankai when later, there is an aura surrounding Ichigo resembling a hollow that appears after Ichigo asks for more power from Old Man Zangetsu.  

OMZ mentioned in the current arc that he had been suppressing real Zangetsu's influence on Ichigo's power the whole time.  My theory is OMZ gave Ichigo more power by temporarily weakening his suppression of real Zangetsu

Kubo actually made a decision for a love interest for ichigo instead of the generic ""which person will the main character pick? could be any of these girls am I right audience?"" animes and other stories tend to use.

Is the fullbringer arc exciting? No, but every story has to have a break and a bridge to connect the plot points. The fullbringer does exactly that.

1351167570.0,1228rz,The Bleach Theory of Everything - a theory on the relationship between all Bleach characters (SPOILERS),Andygoesrawr,59,13,41,"**Forewarning:** This post references a lot of stuff from throughout Bleach including the most recent chapter

.

**Introduction:**

Hello! I've been reading people's theories about Bleach recently

The majority of my theorycrafting has gone into trying to explain how the powers of various characters relate to each other

.

**The Model:**

First of all: I've decided to create [a little diagram showing my theory of  the categories of all powers and their relationships to one another](http://i.imgur.com/W8bfo.png).

Also, such as Ichigo's Hollow form, and also assume that Orihime is a Fullbringer (very likely).

.

**The Relationship Between Resurreccion and Fullbring:**

The only particularly radical aspect of my diagram it is the fact that I've grouped Resurreccion and Fullbring together. A lot of people don't seem to particularly share this view with me, in most cases - Aaroniero and Starrk are the only exceptions seen). Therefore, I feel it's only natural to assume that these powers are one in the same. HOWEVER, a Resurreccion clearly includes Hollow body powers, which explains why Fullbrings are not Hollow-like in appearance, and why Arrancars are only Hollow-like once in their Ressurreccion - they've simply combined their ""Fullbring"" with their Hollow powers inside their spiritual object (their ""Zanpakuto"").

.

**The Relationship Between Zanpakuto and Fullbring:**

Another aspect of the Fullbring which I've semi-explained in the diagram is the fact that both the Fullbring and a Zanpakuto are the same type of powers (being spiritual object powers), we can see that his Bankai is able to flow perfectly through his Fullbring, through the appearance of the ""X"" shape on his back in his Bankai which is pink rather than green, meaning it's most likely his Shinigami reiatsu. Another example of the combination of a Zanpakuto and Fullbring is Ichigo once his Shinigami powers are restored. Note: I know that it's not quite his entire Fullbring which has combined with his Zanpakuto, but in the latest chapter it appears as though he can still use his Fullbring, through the way that his Reiatsu flairs off him like it did in his Fullbring's second version.

.

**Just a bit of fun:**

As such, effectively gaining a weapon with one sealed state and possibly two Quincy releases (generally one, the second one being Vollstandig), two Hollow releases (Mask/Fullbring, Full Hollow form/Fullbring - similar to Resurreccion and Segunda Etapa but don't shoot me) and two Shinigami releases (Shikai, Bankai).

.

**Ichigo Post-Dangai and the Final Getsuga Tensho:**

Ichigo's evolution is pretty easily explainable using this model as well: Aizen praised his post-Dangai form as his body having fused with his Zanpakuto, and it was able to flow through his Zanpakuto and the world around him because of his Shinigami object powers.

This ALSO explains why both Ichigo and Isshin were able to achieve the Final Getsuga Tensho, but a happy coincidence.

.

**The Fucking Hogyoku:**

Currently the only powers which defy this model are the Hogyoku and its related ""gifts"" (Aizen, etc). Fuck the Hogyoku.

.

So

There's this kid (middle schooler) named Ganta. And Ganta is one unlucky dude, when his friend Mimi comes up and starts talking about god knows what. Just normal conversation stuff. Then his other friends start getting involved, and everyone's having a good time. But shit gets real when class starts. Ganta sees this guy floating in mid air outside the classroom window, in an all red suit...thing. And then he blacks out. When he comes to, everybody's dead. All his friends, everyone. Dead. Deader than any dead thing that has ever died. And standing there smiling is the man in red. He throws a red crystal at Ganta, and he blacks out again and wakes up in the hospital. Seeing as he's the only survivor, and eventually learns he's gonna die there. Then he meets this magical girl named Shiro


So that's this week's manga. And due to popular demand

Well

In [this](http://i4.mangapanda.com/bleach/405/bleach-2400183.jpg) page from chapter 405, but the strings aren't visible through the energy in either). Prior to this attack by Isshin, Aizen was being beaten down by Yoruichi and Urahara, with Isshin nowhere to be seen. It's highly likely that during this time, Isshin was off to the side releasing his Shikai, and after he fired a full-powered Getsuga Tensho, he sealed his sword.

So following this, because his Zanpakuto revolves around the Getsuga in the same way Ichigo's does.

EDIT 2: IDEA!!!! Let's have a giant discussion thread where we post the pros and cons of each fighter left before we begin voting. That way we can get facts

The entire measurement of speed in Bleach is skewed. You've got Byakuya, which is entirely about focusing all reiatsu inwards and consolidating it into his small frame. But then, Ichigo gets outmaneuvered by almost everybody he fights afterwards. We know Yoruichi is extremely fast, as well. Everybody keeps talking about Shinji being fast but I don't think it's every been mentioned that he was particularly fast. 

And this whole ""Ishida is fast"" thing is pretty ridiculous. People actually think he's faster than Captain level shunpo and Espada Sonido. The only two people he fought were Yammy (extremely slow) and Grantz (also never moves hardly at all). When he fights a faster opponent

And Ichimaru's bankai is supposed to be like ~~ten times the speed of light~~. If that were the case, but still). 

We have all these people who are being called 'fast', and they are losing. I just really feel like the idea of 'speed' in the bleach universe needs to be re-looked at and re-examined when you guys make your choices, because it's obviously not the only factor here.

1362768633.0,19xche,[SPOILER] Theory on Ichigo's zanpakuto.,Monory,44,2,28,"This is a little bit of a conspiracy theory

We know that in the first part of the manga Ichigo had his boring longsword after being stabbed by Rukia, but could very well be Urahara's asauchi. [Looking at them](http://i20.mangapanda.com/bleach/61/bleach-1586680.jpg) they even resemble the criss-cross armguards Ichigo has in the more recent chapters. The encroachment process was pretty intense and would have allowed Ichigo to quickly imprint upon the asauchi. This is also the first time Ichigo ever experiences his inner world with Zangetsu, consistent with this being the first time he is in contact with an asauchi. If Urahara is in fact manufacturing his own asauchi, he may have even been able to create versions that can be imprinted upon by humans, leading to the fulbringers and people like Orihime. 

It is also unlikely that Ichigo's sword comes from his quincy side. We know that quincy powered weapons purge hollows completely

Edit: Further evidence that Urahara could have created asauchi. The two kids at Urahara's shop seem to have come from nowhere, Urahara seems to have uncanny control over his own Zanpakuto, which could be explained by it being his own creation.

Second edit: It is also possible the ""chain of fate"" that ichigo sees in the hole while training is not actually his chain of fate, even in the hospital guy who's chain is eroding. His struggle with the chain could be analogous to Renji's fighting in the soul king's realm to prove himself worthy to the asauchi. Either he proves himself worthy of the asauchi, or he dies.

&gt; ""The unbearable vacancy of the throne in the sky""

At the time it seemed like he was just talking about becoming a god. But later we learned that his goal involved trying to get to the soul kings palace

A secondary theory to build on that, because the soul king isn't a shinigami. Squad Zero didn't interfere with Aizen, because he had the potential to be such a replacement, and S0 has already established that protecting the king and the overall balance was their only concern (They'd have stopped Aizen if SS failed, after the monster he turned into, but prior to his breakdown they probably wanted to wait and see).

If it's assumed that the king became absent a thousand to two thousand years ago, assumably, other non zanpaktou means - Kido kills anyone?) are destroyed entirely. The whole quincy genocide happened because those destroyed souls where threatening the balance of the worlds. So how was the balance maintained before zanpaktou where invented? Why doesn't sending souls to hell, and thus out of circulation, cause problems?

The soul king is able to take destroyed souls and re-form them as purified beings. Souls wouldn't need someone to send them to soul society, while hell isn't indefinite torture forever it's just somewhere the soul king puts particularly cruel souls to punish them before purifying them and returning them to the cycle. Then one day the soul king stops doing his job. The path for souls grows twisted and dark, and hollows become more and more common, while destroyed souls aren't being restored to the balance. Zanpaktou are invented to pick up the slack, the Quincy get wiped out because their methods of fighting have suddenly gone from fine to risking reality, and the shinigami acadamy gets set up because suddenly they need as many shinigami on the job as possible. Additionally, most of the characters don't know that far back into history - the only characters shown to be older than the Acadamy or educated enough like Yamamoto or Urahara aren't the type to go telling stories about how the world used to be - so it makes sense that most souls would believe this is just the way it's always been.

I don't know if much has been said on this
So you have all these names linked. The ""slaying moon"" destroy's Aizen's illusion by transcending (connecting to heaven's domain, there's still the ""Mirror Flower"" part of Aizen's zan, and his ability to affect Bach in the Muken, plus we've never seen his bankai, so to me that tells me there's still a big reveal on his part. That said, I think it also reflects Aizen's ""it's never what it seems"" personality. The whole looking for the kings key (And the fact it wasn't something that could be grasped in hand), combined with it NOT actually being possible for him to ""get"" in the first place. It was all a dream for him so he would have to MAKE his own for it to be reality.  
Also, and he activates both his hollow powers and his quincy powers in his bankai. Add that to Zangetsu needing to be rebuilt, Ichigo getting Quincy powers, and their star/solar theme, and I'm seeing Ichigo finally getting new powers/a zan rename or something. Call it farfetched, but I've always been interested in the nomenclature in Bleach, and I don't think it's going to be empty and abandoned.
  Anyways, something about how the fact that Engetsu was scathing is going to link in to this whole Quincygo/Bach story (See the nearby thread on his family as it has some good ideas), injuring but not slaying them... But I'll remember shortly I hope.

Second

I got into Bleach  maybe  five years ago. I fight depression, and ADD. Those are the big ones. Yeah, I know, I hit the genetic lottery. About a year after I first got into it my girlfriend of four years broke up with me.  It was for the best, but at the time it didn't feel like it. This set off a massive depression that was a long time coming. I had a crisis of self identity, self worth and a shit ton of other things. I needed something to fasten onto, something to anchor myself to. I fastened onto hollows. Ulquiorra was exactly what I wanted to be. Cold, calculating. It seemed like the ideal existance for me as I tried to fight down these emotions and feelings I couldn't understand or control. I  idealized him and subconciouslly based my actions and interactions on his. After about six months in this downward spiral I realized flaw in this idealization. Ulquiorra was a Nihilist and believes in nothing that he can't see. At first I empathized with this; bonds of friendship couldn't be seen and my friends had all let me down. It was comfortable building this shell of no emotion and dampening my own reaction

My world collapsed. I realized that why I was so miserable was because I had built this shell and cut everyone off. There were people who cared for me but I had willingly cut them out of my life in order to feel comfortable and safe. It was easier to be like Ulquiorra and be cold

Now that my world had collapsed and I was starting over

Turns out I followed a good ichigo timeline, I'll drag you down into the mud and crush your skull!"" Unlke Ichigo, I was aware that I wasn't completely in control of my hollow. Last fall I moved to a very rainy area of the state, and that fall and winter brought with it the re-emergance of my hollow. My grades plummited and I became anti-social. Luckily for me I had a very understanding room mate and the self awareness to get into counciling right away. It was short, but I had certainly been face down in the mud with a weight on my skull. Now I feel like I have Hollow Mask 2.0. It's a shaky control, and there will have to be some violent and long-lasting battle before I am completely at peace once again. I will never reach Mugetsu and be one with it, though. I've accepted that I will have to live with this my entire life.

Interestingly enough, you are one. What is there to fear? Cast off your fear. Look forward! Go forward! Never stand still. Retreat and you will age. Hesitate and you will die!"" I listened to that walking to class. I had it on my alarm notification to get up. ""FACE FORWARD"".  Now that I'm out of my depression, I still have this mantra. But today I noticed something interesting. I put my tablet down to answer a phone call. I absently pushed the power button to wake it up and the camera turned on for my Face Recognition screen lock. I looked at it and it was an interesting view of the leafless tree I was walking by. By continually ""Facing Forward"" I had been blind to the things around me. Maybe it's  time to loosen up on these words I've been living by and open myself up to other directions besides Forward. No offense to Zangetsu. It was great advice and got me through a tough time. 

I feel like this whole analogy isn't too far off the mark

Sorry for the wall of text

So, permanent or temporary, and live life to the fullest (age to the fullest, go bald to the fullest)! Retreat and you will age! Hesitate and you will die!

* And OMZ is his shield, his Blut Vein when Ywach stabbed him

1376534431.0,1ke7fp,Theory in Aizen's favor. Wall of text.,DreDayDrizzy,42,9,18,"First I want to say that I always believed the reason Aizen lost was because his will was to meet someone as strong as him

But my theory is Aizen still has the hogyoku within him it never left and it still chooses him as the master. Why? Because once Aizen met Ichigo after dangai training Aizen was curious as why he couldn't feel Ichigos spiritual pressure. Aizen then concluded that Ichigo had another ""dimension"" of power where shinigami, full bringer are one dimensional, Aizen who had transcended was 2 dimensional but Ichigo was 3 dimensional. That was my understanding.
This is where my theory begins

One of the first things to happen after Aizen recovers from mugetsu is his zanpakuto begins to disappear

So Aizens zanpakuto was not deteriorating but fusing with him to achieve something similar to Ichigos FGT without losing his power afterwards. And thus the hogyoku begins reverting Aizen to its former self in order to reconstruct becoming a newer improved transcendent being.

Aizen mentions himself when fighting with gin you can't evolve without fear

Now flashback to Aizen vs Urahara

I think his time in solitary confinement is essential for evolving into a stronger transcendent being becoming one with zanpakuto (this is basically his dangai training)  Aizen has been able to train for 17 months compared to Ichigos 3 months. Keep in mind when Ichigo was training he just sat still.

Aizens progression is apparent when Juha Bach invites Aizen to join but declines and later Haschwald says Aizen altered the time how long they have been in soul society. I had another theory before where Aizen met Bach before and used his zanpakuto on him. Similar to Aizens encounter with Barragan which is how he could alter Bachs time. Yet he was completely bound to the chair! No sword in sight.
So I think he finished evolving into one with his zanpakuto and still has his hollow power and he will soon break free to fight in the final days.

The rest of my theory really only can happen if the Soul King is a bad guy. Which is an idea in not to fond of but...

After Ichigo beats up every Quincy and somehow squad 0 is gone Ichigo fights Uryu and he is told what the soul king does and blah blah he's evil. Ichigo and Uryu team up to defeat Soul King but Urahara shows up to stop them

TL;DR Aizen evolved into another transcendent being similar to FGT without loosing his powers and will have a rematch with Urahara.",,t5_2rk7q,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/bleach/comments/1ke7fp/theory_in_aizens_favor_wall_of_text/

You join the Gotei 13 and are given a Zanpakuto. It never leaves your side

You train more

So my entire theory is predicated on a somewhat weak

What if the sword fragments your soul

Look at the espada. Breaking the boundary between hollows/shinigami gave them great power by giving them intellect/strength. Their swords limited their power - a release brought them back to their original state. So once again

Most hollows lost the ability to regenerate when they became arrancars. However

This theory is fucking nuts I admit. It's like a worst case scenario assuming everyone in Squad 0/SK is evil. But I don't understand how come all these great thinkers and creators made these inventions that don't seem to allowed in the Gotei. 

Squad 4 heals with kido, and the other method of fighting (using Quincy techniques) is outlawed and the clan was destroyed. Why did the creator of the sword keep saying you got your basis wrong for the zanpaktau? How come only Shinigami could master an Asauchi? 

What do you guys think! any other conspiracy tidbits we can add?

This theory is what I've gathered about the main characters
NOTE: Bach = Yhwach

First we have to go the beginning, likely only consisted of 13 members even though Shin'o Academy has existed for 2100 years training Souls, because when Yhwach was talking about the first Gotei 13, it showed only 13 individuals.  
The original Gotei 13 acted as ""ruthless killers"" guardians of Soul Society, and with this knowledge, we can assume Zero Division member Oetsu Nimaiya was also in Gotei 13 at that time, since he is the creator of the Asauchi and in the process created the Zanpakuto. Oetsu has stated all Shinigami Zanpakuto originates from him, as he created every Asauchi for each Shinigami, and for any Shinigami to unlock Shikai and Bankai, they must train with a Zanpakuto containing a Asauchi
Since there were only 13 members
This can explain why the original Gotei 13 were ruthless killers, people that die in the Living World were all becoming Hollows in mass numbers, than being cleansed when once killed.  

We know that Yhwach is over 1000 years old, but we will assume that for now.   
What happened in the fight between Yamato and Yhwach?   
My theory is that 1000 years ago, the Quincy decided to pick a fight with Gotei 13, for what reason we aren’t told.  
I believe that the Quincy of that time were angry at the Gotei 13 for not using their power to defend the living world from Hollows, and decided to attack them so they can take the responsibility of defending Souls all together (Soul Society and Living World), something that the Gotei 13 wasn't doing as 13 members weren't enough to defend Soul Society and the Living World from Hollows and sending Souls to Soul Society.  
I think what happened after the Yhwachs' defeat was that Yamato realised Gotei 13 cannot contain only 13 members
Yamato realised that they cannot just defend Soul Society with 13 members
Now they have an army, and sending souls from the Living World to Soul Society, becoming what they are now, proper guardians of Soul Society and the Living World.  
Over time, and more time maintaining peace in Soul Society.   

Now with this gets interesting. Since there are now Shinigami actively defending Soul Society and Living World
They chose to spend their existing time in Hueco Mundo
Even with the new found powers, Vice-Captains, and Royal Guards are still easily capable of defeating a Gillian-class Menos.   
The Gillians continue their devouring of fellow Hollows as they now realise they can become more powerful with more Hollow they consume
The Menos that reach Adjuchas-class become more intellectual
The Hollows that roam the Living World either cannot control their hunger for souls

Now to approximately 200 years ago just before the Quincy Purge. Since the defeat of Quincy 800 years prior to this point, who has found a food that has high Reiryoku, but not as powerful as Shinigami, therefore they take the risk to actively attack them. Because of the more frequent attacks against them and those around them, the Quincy spread the teaching of Quincy techniques and at the same time become more hostile towards the Hollow, no longer treating them as fallen souls, but more like criminals that does not deserve to be sent to Soul Society by Shinigami.
