As many of you know, and therefore it should be shutdown entirely. He removed all of the other moderators, and called it a day.

As expected with a subreddit of over 400, there was quite a lot of backlash. I'm fuzzy on the details, but I know that appeals were made to the reddit admins to have this guy removed as a moderator, and for them to reinstate the other former mods. 

The admins have always been pretty clear on the powers of mods and creators, add custom CSS to turn the whole thing neon green, and spam the reddit all day long with pictures of household sponges, that's their prerogative. It's batshit insane, sure, but they're within their rights to do it. This means that the admins wouldn't step in, and in the end other users had to convince the ""owner"" to let the other kids play again.

Hopefully, and the **vast** majority of what I do here is to clean out IWTLs that have been wrongly flagged by the spam filter. I'm pretty sure that's true of the other mods as well, since I can see the posts they've removed and I can't remember a time I've disagreed.

Still

Admins, or if I change the CSS to neon green and start posting sponge pictures all day, feel free to have me demodded, leaving Azemute in charge.

**UPDATE:**

Thanks to everyone who helped me with this! I took a lot of advice from all of you and also utilized some of the web-link resources you sent me.

Two days ago I built a memory palace. It was fantastic and I used it to memorize the order of *two* randomly shuffled decks of cards!

Yay!

Yesterday I woke up and spent 10 minutes looking at a new deck of cards. I looked through them *once* and was able to memorize *all but 2* of the cards in the right order!

**Thank you all again so much!** This was super fun!

********************************

**Some tips I feel I might give

* Using smells:

&gt; I made four of the cards smell like things. I imagined myself picking the card up and smelling the back of it. It smelt like strawberries. Then I turned the card over and saw that it was the J of Clubs. From then on, I just had to pick it up and ""smell"" it, then I remembered exactly what it was!

* Using pains

&gt; A friend of mine mentioned that you can imagine that the first card is poking you in the head, this one is the 7 of spades. then when you want to go back and remember the orders just remember the pains. I didn't use this technique, but I imagine that it works pretty well, from what worked for me yesterday, so I'm going to try it I think.

* Using annoyances

&gt; In one part of my memory palace I walk past a TV that is blinking a card with an annoying beeping noise in the back-ground. I don't like this noise so I walk into the kitchen where there is a cup with a card on the outside of it. I drink something out of this cup, and I notice that the tiles of the cloor onto which I vomit are all the shape of another card.

This worked pretty well for me.

Thanks again

The memory palace is an anchient technique used still today by champions of memory competitions who report only having average memories, poems, and more.

I just read this bestof http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nxdzz/im_not_as_smart_as_i_thought_i_was/c3d91jl and it definitely slapped me in the face.  The biggest thing that stuck out for me was this:
&gt; You got A's because you studied or because the classes were easy. You got a B probably because you were so used to understanding things that you didn't know how to deal with something that didn't come so easily. I'm guessing that early on you built the cognitive and intellectual tools to rapidly acquire and process new information

Everything has come rather easily for me, Locke, Plato, and John Stuart Mill.  I did alright, but i had trouble actually understanding the arguments and *thinking* philosophically.  My question is simple: how can i go about studying such texts.  After I finish this post, i'll be starting Marx's Communist Manifesto.  I try to use a pen to underline and make brackets around the stuff i think is important, but i feel like i'm even doing that poorly.  I just kind of underline whatever i think might help me write a paper later.  When it comes to writing an argument paper, *thinking philosophically*.  My professor said we should be able to do so by the end of the semester

**Edit:** I'm fairly new to reddit, but instead trying to figure out if it's the way i posted (or something along those lines- being something i can control) or if people just don't like philosophy.

&gt;&gt;IWantToLearn is meant to help people who are looking for help starting a major project or learning a new skill.  I recently wanted help learning to play the guitar.  I've played for years and thought reddit would probably have a lot of resources for me to use so I did a search.  I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/bcp7j/iwtl_how_to_play_guitar/).  Since finding the subreddit I have found a lot of things I'd like to do that I never realized I wanted to do before. Check [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/e36i9/iwtl_lets_make_a_list_of_frequentlyrequestedtopics/) for their frequently requested topics.  This is one of my ""go-to"" subs when I'm looking for a good read.  I advise the ones of you who are interested in learning something new everyday go check it out.  You won't regret it!


&gt;&gt;So let's celebrate this subreddit!  /IWantToLearn is **AWESOME**!!










##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

IWantToLearn (IWTL) came from my own desire to learn a martial art. It was a bit of a passing thought, which seems to traditionally have a lot of mind share, and friends who have been involved with other martial arts, but I never knew which way would be right for me and my goals.

I thought that one way to solve my problem would be to reach out to the reddit community and see what their thoughts were on the subject, and I abstracted my specific question into a more generalized ""How do I do &lt;x&gt;?"" and realized that, like DoesAnybodyElse, this could be a whole class of AskReddit questions which is better served by having a dedicated subreddit.

One criticism I've repeatedly seen for IWTL is the idea that all this information is already out there, or you'll find something like the loads of programming blogs which mean well, but can contain subtle errors which can lead a young developer down a very wrong path to internalizing some very bad habits.

Searching on Google for information on a subject seems like an odd way to learn a new topic, leaving you prone to missing large chunks of a subject. By contrast, declaring on a reddit submission, ""I want to learn how to &lt;x&gt;, and this is where I am in terms of finding my way"" seems like a great way to find gaps in your knowledge. You're allowing the community to tell you how they learned the subject, they can educate you on areas of interest you may not have known existed, and they can warn you about various fallacies and other pitfalls you might run into. These people have the benefit of having once been in your shoes

So that's how IWTL was born; I'll leave it to xtirpation to fill you in on more of the day-to-day stuff, but I think xtirpation has his finger on the pulse of the subreddit moreso than I do.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================


IWTL really doesn't need much moderation. From time to time we'll see comments mocking a poster's question and those are generally the ones I'll remove to uphold the idea that there's no such thing as a dumb question. Other than that

We're starting to see more and more variation in topics that Redditors want to learn, it seems like someone out there has at least some expertise and can point in the right direction to get people started. Among the favourites that Redditors like to learn are languages, programming, and musical instruments.



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

I think my martial arts IWTL was the first submission ever posted there. It actually has a disclaimer at the top of it saying that I was using it as a sample question. I think that I got some pretty good advice in that thread

There have been a few interesting IWTLs that I've followed

We had another one - I don't think it was that long ago - asking how to properly roll Rs. That one was interesting because apparently there are actually two different ways that people produce an R sound, I did learn why I'm so hopelessly incompetent at it.

As far as having a pulse on the subreddit, so I don't find myself watching the place very closely. I don't know how common the feeling is among mods of other reddits, but I've always felt vaguely guilty about not being overly active in that respect. I spend time there, sure, but it feels like I should be doing more somehow.

I think we're much too varied a subreddit to have a consistent feel. IWTL deals with a wide range of topics, and I've been surprised at the breadth of knowledge our subscribers display. Even on really obscure topics, you'll still typically get a few really good answers. It's really cool.


##xtirpation##
=======================================================================

The one thing I learned that really sticks out in my memory is Ruby on Rails. I'd always wanted to try the language out

I find myself learning things (not in depth

As for the pulse of the subreddit, otherwise if people downvoted things they didn't want to learn, or if they downvoted topics just because they were ""stupid"", we wouldn't have nearly as many interesting comments and replies.

I think the one thing that embodies the subreddit is a general sense of curiosity. Certainly people don't frontpage us because they constantly have things they want to ask/learn. It's more likely that people want to see what they can learn

Sorry 'bout the late reply



##AgentConundrum##
=======================================================================

Just to touch on the upvote/downvote stuff that xtirpation mentioned

As the sub grew, any new post can hit the top of the page, even if it's been downvoted). We now have two systems in place to discourage downvoting. First, if you hover over the downvote button, a little tooltip pops up and asks you to think it over first, and that others are entitled to ask what they want. Second, we don't display downvote counts on submissions. Where a post would usually display the vote total, and the downvote total for a submission, ""20 people like this"". I think de-emphasizing the downvote total very subtley suggests that downvotes are very much frowned upon outside of certain extreme circumstances.








&gt;&gt;Thanks a lot guys.  I really appreciated our talk.  I look forward to being on /IWantToLearn when I should be /AtWork doing shit.  I like it better here!  : )

I don't have ANY money to spend....Like maybe $10 a month at the max for things like props. I have a cheap camcorder and lots of artistic and creative talent....and a husband. We also have like 3 friends between the two of us and we rarely ever see them. I can't rely on giving them parts in the film really or we'll never get to finish. So its just me and hubby doing it all. 

My question lies in things like: how do I find places to film? How can I do a scene in the woods where someone screams or has a weapon--and not have the entire state's worth of police show up on us? How can I creatively alter and/or add sounds to the things we film? Any good free software that I should look into? Where can I find typical 'nails on a chalkboard' spine tingling horror movie sounds for free. Like that sharp violin sound you hear when something freakish happens.

1372549003.0,1hc4hs,I want to learn how to not have a quivering voice in meetings,no_doubt,144,40,52,"Hi everyone
For as long as I can remember

 If it were just for speeches it would be fine

So far I have been getting by using a bit of propanalol. However, I end up coming off a bit spacey in meetings. Also, I can't plan for impromptu situations. E.g. In the past I've had meetings where a senior executive visits and folks in the company had to introduce themselves. Those went disastrously for me and led to very bad impressions in front of everyone.
It was so bad

I feel that I'm the only person I've seen who has it this bad. I've seen people who are nervous in speeches (but recover quickly) but no-one who get's nervous in regular meetings. I'm otherwise not an awkward person (with the exception of getting nervous around very senior people).

I'm 28 and I really want to overcome this and not be something I look back on after several years and regret. I've tried and am trying a bunch of things like yoga, hypnosis (I _think_ it works for regular situations but I'm afraid to put it to a live test) etc. I suspect it may be a medical issue even - heavy-metal poisoning from cavity filings or weakened stress-handling as a result of childhood gastroentritis &amp; bouts of malaria; but these are just shots in the dark.

I would really appreciate help from anyone else who has overcome such a problem.

Thanks a lot

3 9 y/o sibling Chihuahuas, and Female
My most angering moments is feeding time. Alpha and Beta refuse to NOT eat out of different bowls. They MUST eat at the same bowl and this leads to competitive

 In similar vein, noticeable comfort or attention. He gets jealous and fights can start from this too. When he acts like this I yell at him and say useless stuff like ""LEAVE HIM ALONE!!"" While smacking his butt.  Often times the two of them can't stand to be 5 feet from eachother, yet they put themselves in that position anyways. Very frustrating. 

Female is a bitch in all senses of the word. She learned from the two boys and thus from me to snap and bite her way to what she wants. She hates the boys. With passion. She's very stubborn. If she doesn't want something like going outside, and I spoil her rotten with the most attention. 

When they don't fight, outside, basic whistle commands and follow them greatly for the most part. It only makes me more frustrated that I KNOW they can be good dogs when they act up and start fighting each other. 

These are the jist of the issues. I personally need to take them for more walks and keep my cool because they are just dogs. I may also be slightly under feeding them assuming that one big can is good enough for three small dogs. There is a lot I, truly. ",,False,,t5_2rjo5,1359576173.0,,

Now I think I'm finally ready to separate from my family and live my life to the fullest however there is one problem... My friends suck, friends who have stuff in common with me, friends who want to play sports, go to movies, experience new things etc, but the problem lies in that I have no idea of how to go about making new friends.  
The main reason why would be because I have always been shy (I'm not as shy as I used to be now

- I'm a 25ish years old male  
- I love to play the guitar but I suck at it due to not playing it for so many years  
- I love photography  
- I have a lot of hobbies but don't dedicate a lot of time to them (this will change once I leave one of my jobs and move out)  
- I love playing all kinds of sports (but somehow not interested in American football) and I don't see the appeal of watching sports in the TV but from time to time will watch stuff like the World cup of football or baseball.  
- I enjoy having a few beers with friends but don't want to do that ""lets drink 'till we pass out"" stuff  
- I love playing videogames on my PC and doing geeky stuff on it.  
- I love experiencing new stuff which  is probably the reason why I have so many hobbies but kind of hate that about myself because I end up being a Jack of all trades and master of none

I walk by this co-worker that I don't know very well. He tells me ""your lazy"" I said ""What?"". He asks me ""You're going home?"". I said ""yeah"". ""Well your lazy"". I just walked away. Turns out he left too. A minute before I did. Yeah hypocrite I thought. 

Just to clear things up. My boss told me to go home. It's really slow. Because of the inventory team coming in tomorrow. All we did was clean today.

If my blood pressure is increasing, how do I RELAX? I don't know how to let things go and stop over analyzing things, because I fear that if I do

TL;DR: I worry too much, and the vicious cycle repeats.

We've decided to make a summer project out of it (we're both in highschool
So far we want to:

* Build several hammocks/beds: interwoven rope between two branches which we can lie on
* Build a rope system to haul things up in a basket - should be easy
* Build a belaying system so we can self-belay (without jamming hooks or anything like that into the tree and harming it)
* And just about anything else we can think of. We already tried building a swing which we did quickly yesterday and was a lot of fun.


The thing is

* Learning how to tie knots
* Self-belaying
* Building things like hammocks


Is there anything else I should know? I'm guessing the self-belaying system will be hardest to make plus we will need to buy specialised equipment.

What kind of rope should we use? Yesterday we had mooring rope but its fairly expensive so we were thinking of getting cheaper

Is there anything else we should build?

How should we try to hide our rope/efforts so no one sees our work since it will take several days? It's in a public park so a fair bit of people will see it


Is there anything else I should know? Yes if I fall I have a good chance of breaking my back but the exhilaration and sense of adventure is by far worth the risk. We're also smart about our limits. We climbed it twice yesterday and built the swing but stopped there because we both knew we were getting tired and risk-prone.

I've spent the last few months getting my shit together. I'm doing well in school, feel physically and emotionally better, but still have pangs of regret.

I entered college under my parents wishes, and it was the only option I had. My mindset and goals have changed a lot. I'm excited about the future- I have short term goals such as finishing a book, or learning a new technique in a martial arts, and longer term goals such as transferring to a school that has programs I'm interested in, learning to write better, and overall becoming the man I want to be. 

It's great to finally be on a path I want to. I can't help but feel shitty for all the time I wasted. Sometimes, I don't know how to deal with regret. I can deal with failure, but it's something about missed opportunities that drives me crazy.

To teach myself enough mathematics to work out undergraduate-level quantitative economic problem sets.

To teach myself enough about micro and macro economic theories to help me understand how and why people interact the way they do.

To

My Methods (So far):
-MIT's Open Courseware: They have a really thorough microeconomic class

-Kahn Academy: The math they offer goes all the way through calculus (introductory I imagine) and Linear Algebra. Would this be enough for a good start?

-Wealth of Nations: I figure this book seemed to start a lot about modern economics

Evaluation Methods:
Old high school AP exams
