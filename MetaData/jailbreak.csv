1350773237.0,11tgim,How Jailbreak Actually Works.,Synchronizing,668,50,97,"    Intro to Jailbreak

A lot of people do not know how jailbreak actually works. They think it's simply plugging in their devices to a computer, and voilá. The reality is, it is a bit more complex than that.

I will try to explain to the best of my ability on how jailbreak actually works

    What does Jailbreak actually means?

Jailbreak actually means to allow third-party applications to be installed into your iDevice. Contrary to popular beliefs

    How does the jailbreak works?

Jailbreak itself is getting control over the root and media partition of your iDevice; where all the iOS's files are stored at. To do so */private/etc/fstab* must be patched.

fstab is the switch room of your iDevice, allowing eyes and hands (on the root and media partitions).

Sounds easy? Maybe. The **main** problem is not getting the files in, and with out it, the file will be put aside and be unusable. 

So where do we get the key? Well, ""patching this out is A) difficult (especially to track as Apple makes changes) and B) of marginal benefit as adding these hashes is easy."" In other words, it's not worth it.

Before I explain how we bypass these checkpoints

    How does a iDevice bootup?

When an iDevice boots up it goes trough a ""chain of trust"". This chain is a series of signature checks that makes sure everything being ran is Apple approved. It goes on the following (specific) order:

* Runs Bootrom: Also called ""SecureROM"" by Apple
* Runs Bootloader: Generally
* Loads Kernel: Bridge between the iOS and the actual data processing done at the hardware level.
* Loads iOS: The final step to the chain

Great! Now that you know how your iDevice comes to life

    What is the roadbloack in a jailbreak?

What prevents an easy jailbreak is the signature checks. While the kernel is loading there are thousands of checks being done to make sure everything being loaded is Apple approved.

To be more specific, a key. If the key is correct we get a green light, if it is wrong, depending where the check was at or what file it was, it will either crash the iDevice causing a loop, or simply ignore it and does not execute that specific file at all.

    So what is a jailbreaker objective?

The jailbreaker objective is to either patch the checks or simply bypass them. The conventional way is to bypass them as patching all of them would be simply to time consuming and not very beneficial.

Thus bringing us to the two main exploit categories:

* bootrom exploit: Exploit done during the bootrom. It can't be patched by conventional firmware update, thus allowing a passage way to be created to bypass all checks or simply disable them.

* userland exploit: Exploit done during or after the kernel has loaded and can easily be patched by Apple with a software update. Since it's after all the checks

Userland exploits is the most common of them two as they are easier to find

    How did some of the released jailbreak actually worked?

* Limera1n (exploit
* JailbreakMe: Userland exploit that used a malformed CFF vulnerability. CFF stands for Compact Font Format and it's used to store fonts. Starting with PDF version 1.2 it could be imbedded directly into the .pdf file, and open up the PDF file with the edit CFF. When the CFF opcodes (operation code, specifies the operations to be performed) were being handled, Comex (the developer of this exploit), found a way to get a stack overflow (when to much memory is being used in one stack and it attempts to access memory outside of it's own stack), by repeatedly pushing and duplicating random numbers onto an ""argument stack"" (where arguments are stored). By doing so, it allowed Comex to execute any command he would like. The problem with this is that even though he had control over the commands, so Comex digged a bit further and found a IOSurface.framework vulnerability. It would actually use a ROP payload to get access to the kernel memory with 'read-write' privileges. From there, while at the same time being a big worries to Apple. If someone could get into your Phone via Safari to install Cydia

These are the two most know jailbreaks out there. Every other exploit is different

    Conclusion

Jailbreak is not the easiest thing out there. It's time and skill demanding.

Thank you for reading, or if I may have written anything wrong aswell, feel free to contact me via message. I wrote the same thing over 5 times (for the past 5 hours) and might have gotten myself confused along the way.

    Thank You

If this page gets sufficient traction


Only keep reading if you like reading. 

More Info: The main problem keeping Apple from approving the original project was the user-interchangeable Micro-SD memory (Apple hates you being able to buy more disk space easily).   Imagine: and extra 64 GB of storage for your device

My intent was to use the case with my GoPro: slide the MicroSD card into the iPhone right after shooting, or delete it, or upload to youtube immediately w/o my laptop.  Or just have another MicroSD card with a few movies on it.  Or...  yeah. Flexibility that Apple doesn't want you to have. 

**TL;DR-   iPhone case offering user-expandable MicroSD memory and extended battery.  up-vote to encourage an experienced KickStarter creator who already wants to do this

edit: the kickstarter linked to closed many months ago. It was delayed severely due to Apple approvals, but it does not have SDmicro expandable memory. It has expandable memory in a different non-standard format.  This memory format change was due to needing to follow apple's rules with the hardware so that the interface app will get approved by the App Store.  The intent of this post is to encourage the Project Creator to do another Kickstarter for a jailbroken-only version (of the hardware and the software) that ignores apple's rules, after he finishes the current kickstarter.

So here's a simple yet amazing idea:

When a thief holds down the power button to try to shut the phone off

When the thief slides to turn off the phone does the ""Loading"" animation for a second then the screen (does exactly what an iphone does when turning off) then goes to black screen and the backlight is set to 0%. The phone looks like it's completely off. The phone is still on however

Now the only way to turn it back on is to push a secret code in the volume buttons (something pre-configured), up up. Or something like that.

This is so that when a thief steals your phone ant turns it off

Also



Bonus Idea: ""Fake on"", so that the thief doesn't realize he's being duped.

Please upvote this so maybe it will get some visibility and a developer might think about making this idea.

* [LowPowerBanner](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/02/24/lowpowerbanner/) - changes the lower power alert to a banner (so it doesn't take focus from app). Doesn't seem to play nice with DietBulletin at the moment.

* [SwipeAway](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/10/26/swipe-away/) - close all apps in app switcher by swiping up; or close inidividual apps by swiping down
* [Better Switcher Position](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/01/14/better-switcher-position/) - switches music icon and lock orientation icon positions on app switcher (good for lefties)

* Bytafont - changes your default font (Geo Sans Light and Droid Sans are popular on /r/jailbreak)
* [Delete Word](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/07/22/delete-word/) - do you use ctrl+backspace a lot? This brings shift+backspace similar functionality. I do notice a bit of lag with this one unfortunately.
* [DismissMyKeyboard](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/01/13/dismissmykeyboard/) - does your keyboard ever get in your way? Dismiss it by swiping right on the space button

Head over to **/Var/mobile/library/SMS/attachments/** and you'll see a bunch of folders inside those folders they'll be more folders and inside this folders there should be the images. I saved 2.7GB of space by delete all of these and definitely got rid for good of pictures I don't want on my device. 

Let me know if you guys notice yours is very full as well and just out of curiosity if there's a way to stop it from being saved. 

Edit: Just an addendum added to this if you don't have or can't install iFile to your phone you can also do this thru SSH my navigating to the same screen. 

Edit Edit: Just wanted to bring attention to what user [justacheesyguy said

[By deleting message backups  (6.1.1 and older only)](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/17y3ju/psa_free_up_space_protect_your_security_delete/)

[By using the free application PhoneClean](http://www.imobie.com/phoneclean/)

[By using and running iCleaner](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/18vmjv/psa_run_icleaner_weekly_to_free_up_storage_spaxe/)

[Download and use RespringCacheFix on rpetri's repo](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1ag0lc/request_a_tweak_to_clear_other_from_device/c8x268j)

[If you are willing to spend some time resyncing everything

**Delete your email accounts and then re-add them. It clears all of the downloaded attachments and messages**

Delete your browser cache ( history


[Go to /var/mobile/Library/Caches/imageCache and delete it](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1dgqv5/i_cleared_nearly_three_gigs_of_space_on_my_iphone/)

**Go to /var/mobile/Media/ApplicationArchives and delete everything in there - it's all the partially downloaded apps**

[Your album artwork file is huge. I have about 2000 songs and my artwork is at 250mb (See screenshot)](http://i.imgur.com/KSkWrpw.png)


[There are multiple album artworks saved for each song. The only way seen to fix this is to unsync ALL your music then resync it](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/xorcu/multiple_album_arts_for_the_same_album/)

[Check your Downloads folder. If you use iTransmission to download torrents


If you want to find large files on your iPhone via SSH or in MobileTerminal

   **""find . -size +100M -print""**

This will list all files larger than 100mb in the current directory you are in. It will also search any subdirectories. I got that hint from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1ettfa/help_tried_to_install_an_app_legit_noncracked/ca4064h)

If you would like a more extensive way of doing this

What you do
   
   find / -iname “*” -ls | sort -rn -k 7.1 | gawk ‘{print $7
   
And it will print all the files in descending size order to a file named ""files.txt"" in your current directory. You must have Gawk installed for thsi to work. 


**If you have lots of themes installed from Cydia


Go to /var/mobile/Library/Application Support/Containers/eu.heinelt.ifile/Documents/Inbox and check if there is anything you need in there. Delete it. 
In that whole Application Support and Containers folder there is some useless junk. 

**If you have ever used GrooveShark

**Go to /var/mobile/ and do a hierarchical search for Caches. You can delete any folder that comes up - it's just a cache ;)** **Be wary about this though

Go to /var/mobile/Library/DreamBoard. If you uninstall DreamBoard

**Go to /Library (NOT /var/mobile/library

Some people have had success by going to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage -&gt; Music and then swiping on Music and pressing delete, and might actually delete all your music so **do it at your own risk.**



**Needless to say, but sometimes you just forget what you have on there :P**


And now the newest one! I got the information from iFans.


If you have total backup or open backup

As a final note, you have lots of other. You installed lots of themes, or a sync went bad or a download got cut short and there is no way you can find to fix it. In that case, if iLex RAT doesn't work, you will have to do a hard restore.

This is what it does:

Tested on iPhone 5 and 4S both running iOS 6.1 (Should work on iPhone 4 as well.) Not tested on non-retina devices
I couldn't find any issues with JellyLock in combination with LockInfo, and I think this would lead to problems.
Also works with HTML lock screens like Alure LS.
EDIT: I just checked compatibility with AndroidLock XT

EDIT2: Thanks to /r/jailbreak users we found a few bugs:
- when canceling an emergency call or the passcode entry
- with some HTML lock screens the lock is missing before first unlock

I'll address them in a future update ;)

Worst thing I can think of

Known issues:
- the original lock bar becomes visible for a short moment when accessing Siri

Be aware of the following:
Since this changes the way you unlock your device and no software is completely bug free, however keep in mind, that this is still a beta. I chose double pressing lock button as said action.) Although I don't think any thing critical will happen, I'm not responsible for any damages caused by JellyLock.

You can customize JellyLock from within Settings.app and also report bugs from there. Changes don't require a respring.

So feel free to comment what you think and have fun with JellyLock! Let there be bugs! :D

(edit #1: The message on this package was changed by the developer to cite ""CydiaStore regulations"", for this package's content to be altered in any way.)

So, making various arguments back/forth about what my motivations must have been in this decision.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/18h6hn/what_happened_to_adblocker/

(As an example, and on a couple of my packages like WinterBoard, but the ad service I used, AdMob for Mobile Web, was actually discontinued a long long time ago, and all of the code for these ads has long since been removed from the few places they existed.)

I have replied to some of the comments now, I am posting this self post in the hope that everyone sees it.

Here's the reality: I did not actually demand anything, and he wanted to know my ""opinion"".

I typed two lines (this is on IRC) in response: 1) ""I don't really want to do that"" &lt;- to me, they may not end up being important and it may be done anyway, and 2) ""(though we do already sell adblocker, fwiw)"" &lt;- because, well, we do, and that should be taken into consideration.

To me, ""the ship has sailed"", and now, well: ""we do already sell adblocker"".

BigBoss then explained that AdBlocker had actually recently added this feature. For the record, to the extent to which I think blocking ads is wrong (and I often somewhat do), I don't think blocking them in apps is any different than blocking them on websites: same moral dilemma.

However, I don't process or host packages, and--while I directly talk with a number of developers on IRC--I don't directly deal with developer *submissions*: developers work with repositories, and repositories work with me.

This means that if you want to have a package sold in Cydia, though, and he doesn't like it, then his word is law. He can and will pull packages from his repository if he has an issue with them, and inform me after the fact. (I think this is fine.)

So I can understand why BigBoss would have been somewhat upset about the situation, and it didn't seem to involve me. The only contribution I had to the overall discussion past this point is a typically-saurik pedantic what-if regarding a joke someone made.

(Specifically, in a semi-humorous and overly-long way, that that might actually increase sales of the product, as it demonstrates the pain of how horrible ads can be at the point of decision.)

That is the last I heard of the situation. What I figured would happen at this point is that BigBoss would make a decision regarding the new package (whether or not he wants to host it)

However, that we already sell (and which my only commentary on was ""though we do already sell adblocker, fwiw"", remember), has apparently made some changes and in relation put a massive note on their package saying I demanded some technical change to their product because that functionality had to be removed.

Well, I kind of hedged in both directions); all I did was provide a first-blush opinion when informally asked about that unrelated package. I am not even 100% certain what all this feature *does*... I certainly did not demand that it be *removed*.

Also

1: Fakeclockup: Speeds up animations on your phone to make it seem faster (In my experience actually lets me get things done slightly faster)

2: CameraTweak: Cool mod for the stock camera app that lets you do so much more.

3: My3g: Tricks apps into thinking that they are on 3g, etc)

4: Dashboard x: Lets you place notification center widgets on the home screen

5: Ncsettings: Basically a wattered down version of sbsettings as a notification center widget. Also

6: Nitrous: Allows other apps to use safari's nitro webkit thingy (speeds up web browsing in other internet apps

7: WeeTrackData: Notification center widget to track your data usage. (currently not working on iOS 6)

8: iFile: File system access for your iPhone

I've also been told by many people to get BiteSMS

In addition to getting these wonderful apps from Cydia

1: Removing Launch Daemons: Delete iPhone processes that you don't use (such as crash reporters, etc) to free up ram, speed up the phone, and DRASTICALLY speed up boot time, which is important because the untethered jailbreak lets us boot any time we want :)

2: Deleting stock apps: Self explanatory

**SHSH Blobs and you**

Should you ever want to downgrade or re-restore to an iOS version and you've missed the signing window from Apple, you'll need the blobs. You'll also be able to re-restore to an iOS version when the shift-click-restore doesn't work anymore. SHSH blobs are also unique to each device, so you won't be able to share them with other devices.


**Regarding iOS 6.0.2**

Apparently people aren't aware that it's only available for the iPhone 5 and iPad mini. The highest firmware every other device that has iOS 6 can be right now is 6.0.1.

Twitter: [here](https://twitter.com/UnthreadedJB)

Website: [right here](http://unthreadedjb.com/)


**Where we are as of the start of the thread:**

Right now there is a Linux download available on the Unthreaded website. This is for the iOS 5.1 CDMA which has not been exploited before. This is big news as it shows they have some skill. Unthreaded have promised a 6.1.3/6.1.4 jailbreak by the end of tonight

Anyone brave enough to try the .iso on the website should boot into Linux

The .iso **IS NOT A DISK IMAGE** and for the love of the chipmunk lords do not try to boot with it. It's an archive

-------------
**OS Required**

As you can see from what's on the Unthreaded site

I would not recommend a VM (Virtual Machine) for this since you will need to communicate over USB and it can screw up in a VM. Instead use [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) then plug your iPhone into another USB port. 

**Instructions for Unetbootin**

First plug a memory stick into Windows and launch Unetbootin

**BIOS Instructions**

Some BIOS's may boot from the hard disk first. When your computer boots you should see a few options on the first screen before the first Windows logo. One of these may be ""Boot Order"" or ""Boot Device"" - if this doesn't exist F2/Delete is usually setup where you can set your boot order so USB comes first. It should tell you quite clearly which button enters setup if it is neither of these.

From /u/pseudolobster - ""it's usually esc, Esc for HP/Compaq laptops, F8 for a lot of desktops, particularly ones with ASUS motherboards, F12 for dell laptops. Again though, it should say somewhere, ""press [whatever] for boot selection menu"" or similar.""",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1jbmuh/unthreaded_jailbreak_megathread/

I've been lurking /r/jailbreak since the evasi0n jailbreak was released


Here's a list of my current jailbreak tweaks on my iPhone 5 iOS 6.1:

*(tweaks with no price next to them are free)*

* **f.lux** - Adjusts screen colour temperature based on time of day to make it easier on the eyes

* **SBSettings** - Adds a menu with toggles like wifi, location, etc

* **Infinifolders** [$1.99] - Allows you to put as many apps as you want in folders

* **Zephyr** [$2.99] - Access app switcher and switch apps with gestures instead of home button

* **Winterboard** - Themes and UI modifications

* **Barrel** [$2.99] - Lets you select a different animation when going through the pages on springboard

* **BlurriedNCBackground** - Gives the notification center a blurred translucent background

* **FakeClockUp** - Lets you speed up the animations so it seems like your phone is faster

* **Browser Changer** - Lets you change the default browser from Safari to another one you've downloaded

* **Bars** - Adds half/quarter bars on the reception indicator

* **Auxo** [$1.99] - Improves the app switcher; makes it look very nice and adds swipe gestures to close apps instead of having to hold your finger down on them. Also adds stuff on the other pages of the switcher to the left

* **Nitrous** [$0.99] - Changes the javascript engine to the Nitro javascript engine for much faster page load times

* **Octopus Keyboard** [$4.99] - Adds the functionality of the new Blackberry Z10's much-hyped keyboard

* **iCaughtU** - Emails the current address of the phone and a photo of the person that tries to unlock your phone with an incorrect passcode

* **SpringFlash** - Lets you turn on the flashlight of the phone by double-pressing the lock button

* **Zeppelin** - Lets you add a small logo in place of the carrier name

* **Bytafont** - Lets you change the font of the phone

* **Bulletin** [$0.99] - Lets you access the Notification Center from the lockscreen

* **SpotiPlay** - Makes Spotify the default music player

* **iFile** [$4.00 / Free Trial] - Lets you access the phone's filesystem

* **SwipeShiftCaret** - Lets you move your little cursor when editing text with simple swipes

* **Cyntact** [$1.00] / **Copic** [$1.49] - Adds the contact's photo next to their name on the Contacts list. *EDIT: Copic is a great alternative to Cyntact which I've just switched to. It does the same thing but the look is a bit cleaner and it also adds photos to the lock screen

* **StatusTab** - Shows status bar when you're pulling down the notification center in fullscreen apps instead of that little gripper thing

* **DismissMyKeyboard** - Allows you to dismiss a pesky keyboard that won't go away by swiping right on the spacebar

* **IconRenamer** - Have a guess

* **AdBlocker** [$2.19] - Have another guess

* **Dater** [$0.99] - Shows the date and time that each photo was taken in your Photos


Here are some that were very useful for me before but I haven't been able to find working for iOS 6.1:

*(if anyone knows any working alternatives

* **TimeSpeak** - Adds a 'thing' to Activator that speaks the time when activated (e.g. hold down headset mic button and it tells you the time). Useful when phone is in pocket or armband and you want to know the time through your headphones

* **LowPowerBanner** - Replaces the annoying low battery popup with a notification banner. *EDIT: Comments are saying that this works on the 4S

* **Apptivator** - Adds a listener to Activator that lets you do things based on tapping/holding/swiping app icons (e.g. double tap Camera app icon to open Photos)

I probably made a typo or mistake somewhere

Quick question: Do we need to have an ""Our Favorite Tweaks of All Time"" post? I'm worried this will just be incredibly redundant

Also, probably on the 1st and 3rd week of the month. If you'd like to suggest a question for a poll, feel free to PM me, or one of my self-posts.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1cwcd2/ilex_rat_the_official_reddit_page/

Please head over there any difficulty you may be having with iLEX R.A.T

What is iLEX R.A.T?

iLEX R.A.T (Remove All Tweaks) is a tweak/script for MobileTerminal someone came up with. If you install it and have MobileTerminal installed, it doesn't touch your App Store apps and your device remains jailbroken.

Here's the first post made on /r/jailbreak regarding the tweak.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1byge1/has_anyone_seen_this_ilex_rat_removes_all_files/

Not trying to promote or advertise it. My thought process for making this suggestion was as follows:

As per title

What is the probability of you being able to salvage your device and the jailbreak? Nil. 

The reason I suggest for everyone to install is that several members of this subreddit have said they have used iLEX R.A.T and it has saved their devices. 

Here's a post I made to ask those who have used iLEX to report back on their experience.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1cuu1n/have_you_used_ilex_rat_how_was_your_experience/

Installing iLEX R.A.T at least gives you a *chance* of being able to save your device.

I installed iLEX R.A.T this morning because I was about to install TCP Optimizer and worried about potentially effing up my phone. 

If I didn't install it

iLEX R.A.T might not save your device but at least it gives you a chance to try. It gives you a 50% chance that you can save your phone. 

TL;DR : Install iLEX R.A.T because it may save your phone should you mess up your not-downgradeable device.


Repo: http://cydia.myrepospace.com/iLEXiNFO/ (new official repo)

Make sure to install MobileTerminal too.
Alternatively

Install iLEX R.A.T (ENG) for the English one. 
Install iLEX R.A.T (RUS) for the Russian one.

Edit: 

Added link to post with user reviews of iLEX R.A.T

Changed ""ILEX"" to *iLEX* to get rid of confusion about the name. *iLEX R.A.T* is the name

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/144vaz/jailbreak_redmond_pie_progress_alert_list_is_this/) by /u/bottledLighting prompted me to think if there was a way to get an instant alert when the iOS 6 jailbreak is out. And there is!

Just head over to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and make an account. Link your email and phone number (if you have texting). After you're ready to go

This is more for people (which I believe is most) who have lives (I don't) and don't have all the time in the world to constantly browse /r/jailbreak

If you're not already using IFTTT

Recently, who were very close. This weekend I am up visiting my grandfather for father's day and had an idea. How awesome would it be for them to FaceTime each other?! Alas, my grandparents do not own a computer thus do not have Internet. 

And here comes Jailbreaking to save the day. I have used 3G unrestrictor (still have unlimited data) since my first iPhone 4 jailbreak. So I got my mom connected and brought the phone into the living room to my grandmother. They both instantly started crying and saying how much they missed each other. They talked for almost an hour.

Themes

Last month was the first month I included themes in the round up. With the creation of our new subreddit /r/iOSthemes (check it out if you haven't!)

---
Tweak Updates
---

/u/Christodouluke requested last month that I include tweak updates in roundups. I replied saying that I would, so you'll get them as they come.

---

As always, or you think is worth including, just let me know!

I don't even know if anyone remembers or cares, and moderating the new subreddit, and I apologize. The poll will have to be pushed back even more, and I'll do my best to get working on it after my finals when I'm on Spring break (last week of March).

**Edit:** Shameless plug - check out my [giveaway](http://redd.it/19gg16) on /r/RandomActsOfGaming! I get nothing from it other than the joy of giving people games! It'll end sometime Saturday afternoon (PST).

[Jailbreak Nation](http://www.jailbreaknation.com/) posted this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5oIWbMY80&amp;amp;amp;feature=player_embedded) today highlighting three of the best tweaks in their opinion that came out this month:

* **Aicon** ($1.99) - Adds photo effects to icons

Personally, I really enjoy Chromizer and Nitrous. I did pick up FoldMusic, but as of right now it doesn't have the features I want, so I uninstalled it. I would have bought Octopus Keyboard if it wasn't as expensive.

What tweaks did you guys like? Which ones didn't you like? Any that I didn't list here that you really enjoyed using?

1375572022.0,1jngfr,Jailbreak Scams,Synchronizing,237,25,41,"Jailbreak scams have been around since the inception of jailbreaking itself. The very fact someone can make several hundred dollars selling something that is completely free baffles me. Truly though

After snooping around the comments I decided to go along and buy the ""product"" and see what it was all about. I followed /u/its_not_herpes suggestion to [attempt to purchase it at $0.01](http://i.imgur.com/j2kN026.png) and was rather impressed at the results.

It worked perfectly fine. Now, seconds later I received an email saying my [membership had been approved](http://i.imgur.com/ICeTzpS.png) and I was ready to get started. 

Clicking the TinyUrl link I got [redirected to a standard WordPress register page](http://i.imgur.com/heHJNDSh.png) ~~(you can actually register yourself as though you bought it [here](http://thejailbreakshop.com/wp-login.php?action=register))~~

Now, but rather shocked at the fact they [did not even bother to edit the changelog.txt or README.txt](http://i.imgur.com/FdtzbZl.png). 

The whole situation is quite ironic and anyone who has felt for such before: watch-out next time. All these sites are **complete** scams, iOS 7, iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, they will always be crap unless said otherwise by one of the devs.

1326387006.0,oe2n1,Why we can never give ETAs for jailbreaks.,planetbeing,239,24,43,"The problem with giving any definite ETAs is that there can always be problems that crop up that blindside us that will take an unknown amount of time to solve (if they are even solvable). Let me give you a little timeline about this sandbox issue

Generally, are we going to break Apple's protections and mitigations against it. Then, to figure out what precise techniques will we use to implement our ideas. Those take an unknown amount time and may actually be impossible. It is *theoretically* possible for Apple, if they don't make any mistakes, to create a system that prevents jailbreaking. Then, after those are figured out, time can be spent coding the jailbreak, sometimes while coding

When we're at the research stage

I started to actively participate on January 6th, later that day we discovered we misread the sandbox profile and it would not be possible. The next day was spent trying to see if any clever variation of the first idea could get around the sandbox: no.  Then we were messing around and found a small vulnerability in the sandbox, a one millimeter hole in a huge wall if you will, and it seemed like it could be weaponized to get around the sandbox so we can break out. Eventually, I came up with the plan that formed the basis of what we have right now, but it needed three different pieces to make work. I managed to furnish the first piece myself pretty quickly, but the other two were not forthcoming. The next few days were filled with brilliant ideas by brilliant people that would work *if only such-and-such were true*. Every day, we thought we had finally gotten it: The idea had gotten past basic testing, which required finding other candidates for the idea's prerequisites. saurik managed to figure some stuff out that gave us a little more invaluable wiggle room in finding the prerequisites and I managed to find something that would work. I created a proof of concept and it worked!

The result is basically building a program that aims a tiny bullet to shoot out of the one millimeter hole in our sandbox, bounce off a few more surfaces inside the Death Star to get to the control room, and have the bullet bounce off buttons and levers to aim the Death Star at the sandbox wall to blow it up.

We don't think there's any more issues and we are starting to engineer it, but we can't give an ETA.",,False,self,t5_2r8c5,False,,

Patches are very easy to make, the tweak portion of Flex is actually what does all the heavy lifting... so basically these patches can't be installed outside of Flex.

No one wants to screw up their phone and be forced to go to 6.1.3. And let's face it

* Avoid pirated tweaks/repos
* Get tweaks from the default repos. They are maintained by Saurik and others to provide the best possible Cydia and jailbreak experience.
* Keep it lean. iOS is built to run exceptionally well by itself
* Don't go tinkering under the hood. It's very easy to dive into the file system and start moving/copying/deleting files and changing plist values. Just because you can
* **Read the sidebar**. I can't stress this enough. There are some great guides to teach you the ins and outs of jailbreaking. Click on every link and learn something. 
* Use common sense. There are a lot of people who are new to jailbreaking on this sub. If you don't fully understand something or don't have the knowledge and experience to protect yourself from yourself
* [Google](https://www.google.com) is your friend.

That being said

Please feel free to elaborate or challenge my points. I'll update the list with anything worthy.

Activator: Lets me run tasks

Active Dock: ($1.99) Makes the dock look more like OSX. Adds a signal light for running apps and bounces the icons that have recent notifications.

biteSMS: (Freemium) Adds a quick reply feature to messaging and some other useful options.

BluSelect 5.0+: (Paid) Allows me to define an activator gesture to select which bluetooth device to connect to. A lot more useful that just turning bluetooth on or off.

Gridlock 2: (Paid) Put icons anywhere

Hands-Free Control: ($2.99) Makes Siri always listening to her callup word. I have it set to only activate when on AC Power as it really drains the battery.

This is my first post on reddit

*Theme:*

Screenshot: http://imgur.com/YY7zHvi  
Wallpaper source: http://bypxl.com/iphone-5/wallpapers/blue-out-space  
Winterboard settings: http://imgur.com/a/DI0Nf

**Glasklart** (free) - Theme with glass-like icons  
**Glasklart Icons Normal** (free) - Not available on Cydia! Installation is simple via SSH (make sure unzip and wget are installed via Cydia). Once done activate it via Winterboard: `cd /Library/Themes &amp;&amp; wget http://glasklarthd.dreamnet.at/download/Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip &amp;&amp; unzip Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip &amp;&amp; rm Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip`  
My own icons pack for Glasklart - Stay tuned

*Theme/interface-related tweaks from Cydia:*

**Accelerate** (free) - Speed up animations. Although animations are used to bridge loading times
**Action Menu** (free) - Replaces the edit menu (which pops up when you tap on text) by icons
**Action Menu Plus Pack** ($2.99 USD) - Adds useful actions to Action Menu
**AntiTint** (free) - Keeps status bar's color from shifting within an application  
**Auxo** ($1.99 USD) - An amazing app switcher replacement
**Bars** (free) - Extends the signal strength indicator by incremental steps.

**Five Icon Dock** (free)  
**FullForce for Phone** ($0.99 USD) - Adjust the layout of some legacy application to fill the iPhone 5 screen. Definitely better than the free alternatives since it asks you whether to apply the fix the first time you start a legacy application and is able to apply changes to the configuration without respringing.  
**SimpleWiFi for NotificationCenter** (free) - Shows your IP and the SSID of the WLAN access point you are currently connected to (useful for OpenSSH).  
**Zephyr** ($4.99 USD) - Very nice but pricey multi-tasking tweak. Slide up from the bottom of your screen in order to close an application, see screenshots).

**7-zip** - Pack or unpack 7-zip archives  
**adv-cmds** - Collection of command line tools for process access and similar  
**APT 0.7 Strict** - Let's call it the command-line version of Cydia (while Cydia is actually the GUI-version of APT!). Works great with mobile SSH clients.

-  First **uninstall Chrome related tweaks specifically EasyRefresh &amp; Chrome Download Manager and any of those chrome customizers customizations chromizers whatever they're called** (check other chrome related tweaks you have and uninstall those

-  Then **choose to send anonymous usage data info to Google** when you open Chrome.

Anyway, I feel like its a big circle. We support them, and they continue to put out cool software.

So. What's the point of all this? What happens when we buy software from the cydia store

This has happened to me on multiple occasions now. I'm beginning to feel apprehensive about purchasing software from the cydia store. What makes things worse

To name a few off the top of my head... 
1) QuickMP3. A simple tweak to quickly download songs on the fly. I thoroughly enjoyed this tweak. It had a rocky start. Shoddy DRM caused it to become unusable for some time, and the tweak was never updated. Only like 2 months of use.

2) xBackup. I was having problems with my phone

3) Themes ... iFlat in particular. The author won't update it for ios 5.

There are others. A lot of my tweaks

Here's the repo if you'd like to beta test it for me.

With stacks

~~KNOWN BUG: Closing any app from the switcher disables stacks. Respring to fix. Working on it now.~~

Known Bugs:

* Safe Modes upon install on some devices

* ~~Going into Wiggle-Mode and moving an icon from the dock crashes.~~

* ~~stacks-Behind-Apps bug when it shows up behind normal apps.~~

* Settings pane is really glitchy. Doesn't load sometimes on iOS5 (I think) and crashes if you exit Settings while on a list of apps in the stack. Working on it!

* ~~Updating any app causes stuff to crash.~~

&gt; All credits go to /u/JewishCowboy for the [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1bei2p/tweaks_released_in_march_2013/c9659b1).

&gt; This is an original /r/jailbreak event that will take place over the next 3-4 weeks at the end of which we'll be able to determine which tweaks are the most popular in /r/jailbreak.

**How can I participate?**

&gt; * To vote
&gt; * /u/Connguy has suggested that people be allowed to create and submit their own prediction brackets. I've created /r/TweakMadness for that very purpose.

**Initial Tweak ~~Voting~~ Nominations**

&gt; **Edit:** It just occurred to me that Nominations is a better word than voting. I'm an idiot.

&gt; This form is just to decide which tweaks will be included in the tournament. The 16 or 32 tweaks with the most votes will then be put into a randomized bracket.

&gt; [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_urxjdPDKpSdHcvdWXuIrEVGyPxSlnRwfmuyeysMie4/viewform)

&gt; Voting will be open for at least 2 days

Enjoy:

* Activator 

* AirBlue Sharing - Share files over bluetooth. Wonderful app/tweak

* AnyAttach - Attach any file and as many as you want with Mail.app. I use Sparrow as a default

* AnyVoice - I much prefer the male British voice to the standard Siri voice. Straight male here :p

* AppCent - Shows percentage complete of updating/downloading apps where the name of the app would be.

* AssistantExtensions - All sorts of nice plugins for Siri. I use SBSToggles and JpgToSiri the most. The former is access to any SBS toggle via Siri

* AssistantLove - Integrates GPS

* biteSMS - I love the quick reply/quick compose. I have QC set to home button triple-click in Activator. Can't recommend this enough. License is half-off now.

* BrowserChooser - I use Chrome as my default browser. This tweak allows that

* Bulletin - Notification Center on the Lockscreen. Dismiss NC to unlock. I use it all the time.

* BytaFont - Change system font. I use Questrial

* CamFast - Activator addon for a quick camera.

* ChromeCustomization - Swipe up in Chrome to refresh the page, tracking suppression, etc.

* ClickToCall - Allows one tap (well, tap the one you want to call. Don't have to view the whole contact page just to make a quick call. Long press to send a message. Very nice tweak.

* Clock Hide - Hides the LS clock. Options to show the time in statusbar

* Copic - Contact pictures in Phone.app, etc.

* CyDelete - Delete Cydia apps from Springboard.

* Dashboard X - Widgets on the Springboard. I love my favorite contacts being right on my springboard

* DietBulletin - Thin alerts

* DoNotDisturb - Adds an option to the NC to turn on/off. Blocks all incoming alerts (phone, twitter, etc.). Great for movies, dates, etc.

* f.lux - Controls screen ""temperature"" after sundown. Really great for the eyes at night.

* FakeCarrier - Put a fake carrier in the statusbar.

* FakeClockUp - Speeds up animations system-wide. 

* FastBlurredNotificationCenterBackground - Blurred transparent NC background

* Folder Icons - Change... folder icons. 

* FolderEnhancer - Great animations for opening folders, all sorts of minute adjustments to folders.

* Hands-Free Control - Siri always listens for a certain keyword to activate it, with my iPhone on the table next to me. I simply say, ""computer"", and get Siri to call the cops.

* iCleaner - Cleans the cache

* Iconoclasm - Custom icon layouts. Important for me so I can squeeze in whatever Dashboard X widgets I want.

* Iconoclasm Layout Maker - Make custom layouts for Iconoclasm.

* iFile - File browser, very useful for jailbreakers.

* Ipsum - On the lockscreen

* JpgToSiri - Addon for Assistant Extensions to find pictures through Siri.

* Lingual - Siri translate function for Assistant Extensions.

* MobileTerminal - Terminal commands/access for iOS.

* MultiIconMover - Move multiple icons on the springboard at once by selecting them. 

* MyAssistant - System toggles, lock, find the lyrics, tweet, etc.), Activator events, custom replies (I don't use that feature) from Siri. Also can change the Siri background, and language.

* NC weather widgets - New icons for the Weather widget. Nicely stylized- see screenshots.

* NCSettings - Stylish system toggles in the NC. 

* NCSettings Streaks Theme - Streaks above and below NCSettings.

* NCTabClock - When in an app and you pull down the NC tab

* Nitrous - Basically makes third party internet-connected apps (like Chrome) faster

* No Icon Shadows - Good for the icons I use.

* No Keyboard Spotlight - Keyboard doesn't pop up automatically when you scroll to the spotlight page on the springboard.

* NoAccessorySplash - Page doesn't pop up when you connect peripherals

* NoNoNotifications - No ""No New Notifications"" message in the NC.

* NoStoreButton - Removes the Store button from Music.app. 

* NotesTab - Adds a ""tab"" key to Notes.app.

* Octopus Keyboard - Fantastically efficient keyboard taken from the Blackberry 10 OS. Predictive input at its finest. Takes some getting used to

* OpenSSH - Allows SSHing into the device.

* PandoraSkips - Unlimited song skips in Pandora.

* PasswordPilot - Saves your App Store password so you never have to type it in again.

* PhoneCloser - Closes the Phone.app after a call is finished. I hate making a call from the Yelp app

* PhoneHint - Android-style predictive dialing. Start dialing

* PKGBackup - Backs up all your tweaks, as I've had to restore my phone a couple times now.

* Pull To Dismiss - Pull down on keyboard to dismiss it

* QuickClear - Don't have to tap an ""x"" then a ""close"" button for notifications

* QuickNote - Very nice-looking memo widget for the NC

* User Agent Faker - Makes apps think you are not on 3G.

* VoiceSearch - Activator addon to do a voice Google search. 

* Weather Icon - Puts live weather info over your Weather.app icon.

* WeeSpeeddial - Puts your favorite contacts into the NC

* WinterBoard - Enabling of themes.

* Wraparound - Infinite scrolling of springboard pages

But I did it anyway. I'm currently running a jailbroken iOS 6. Yeah. Cool. What now?

Tethered jailbreak (means I have to start my iPhone from a computer), and, most of all : ALMOST NO TWEAKS COMPATIBLE.

Actually, Activator, ManualCorrectPro, and an early BiteSMS beta (7.0b1). Almost all the tweaks says ""Not compatible with iOS 6"", or install, but doesn't work (IntelliScreenX is doing that). Themes are not doing fine too. Loop respring, or it stays in Exit Safe Mode.

So, and wait for a real jailbreak, with compatible tweaks.

I'll start of with my own situation.


I bought a black iPhone 4 out of impulse, I was using a Nokia 3310 yellow and black dumb phone. Since I had iPhone 4, I was mind blown about the capabilities of a smartphone. And I dearly regret not buying a smartphone much earlier. I lost my black iPhone 4 few months later. So I bought my white iPhone 4 which I continue to use today.


I then bought the iPad 1, because iPad 1 is still bulky, and most critically it didn't have any camera !!! I bite my tongue, waited very very patiently, and bought iPad 3 immediately after it was available.


I jail broke my iDevices sometimes after I bought my iPad 3. I cannot remember what exactly triggered that


Since I jail broke my iDevices


The recent iOS 6 upgrade has brought a lot of frustrations to me, ~USD 5-10 tweaks 


I downgraded my iPhone 4 to 5.1.1 for this reason. I leave my iPad 3 to be iOS 6.1.2 so that I can have first experience with iOS 6 jailbreak situation. 


I can't help but wonder, then I get to enjoy best hardware plus all that jailbreak can offer, as ""standard android customizations"".


Am I right or wrong in my understandings ? Why do you stay with iDevices if you are heavy users of jailbreak tweaks / apps ? I'm genuinely curious.",self,t5_2r8c5,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/19n1az/genuine_non_trolling_question_why_jailbroken/

This thread is for me to gauge more interest/work out any ideas you guys have for it?

So far:

- Side Scrolling for easy stat access (Live scores)

- Configurable team options via Settings.app

- Notifications? (This will be able to be turned off ect)

- Automatic update every ""interval"" of time


Suggestions are greatly appreciated! 
Thanks

&gt;Badger is a revolutionary new iOS tweak allowing users to view notifications directly from app/folder icons on their home screen. Using a configurable activation method (icon swipes/badge taps), view them in-app, quickly reply to iMessages/SMSs (as well as mark them read), and more.
&gt;
Badger is designed to make notifications on iOS “make sense”. It’s made to be fully themeable and customizable to make it work the way you want it to. Badger’s made to let you interact with notifications in a way that makes sense and that you can change.
&gt;
&gt;Badger is fully compatible with Abstergo, it can be given through conversations on Twitter with Velox’s developers, but I won’t discuss it more here.
&gt;
&gt;Badger is fully compatible with all iOS devices on iOS 5 and higher

Badger allows you to view notifications directly from SpringBoard. It should be out in Cydia within the next 2-3 days, too!

My friend buys an iPhone to HDMI adapter for his iPhone 4. He tries to get it to mirror what he is doing on the screen but I told him that he needs an iPhone 4S or better for that to work. He doesn't believe me so I tell him to call apple support and see if they can 'fix' it.

What happens next is great

He calls up and explains that he wants to mirror his iPhone 4 onto the TV. They say ""We 100% can fix that problem for you but it will cost 60$"" They had him install remote desktop software and had him on the phone for an hour until I came back over to talk to the guy on the phone. He puts me on hold for 10 minutes and comes back to tell me this

**""Okay you need to go to this website cydia and install something called displayout""**

I was so surprised that I didn't even know what to say at first. I then told him

**""Uhhh im pretty sure you need to jailbreak the iPhone to install Cydia**""

**""No sir you are actually incorrect

**""Uhh....no I'm 100% positive that you need to jailbreak an iPhone to get that...""**

Long story short I had to listen to this guy for 15 minutes until he finally listened to me telling him that it was impossible to mirror his phone from the beginning and all we want is the money back since they could never have even fixed the problem. He then tells me** ""Well you have 7 days of Apple technical support but the 60$ is non refundable""
**

After haggling with the supervisor I was able to have them refund my neighbor 40$ but still I was cracking up after about how this apple support rep was telling me the way to fix their product is to ""go to this website called cydia""

 * one that showcases the best tweaks that have been released in 2012 and
 * another that is /r/jailbreak's favorite tweaks in general.

The first will come sometime after the new year

I was thinking the format could match something like /r/iPad's favorite [apps](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/113gc3/ripads_favorite_apps/) and [accessories](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/113gdi/ripads_favorite_accessories/). Community members just comment with their favorite tweak (one per comment)

**If you have a different way of conducting this

I'm looking to do this after the holidays and New Years because then we'll have an influx of new subscribers

Any thoughts, comments, or concerns?

I'm the developer behind the upcoming tweak, seamless experience from your homescreen. It's been a lot harder than I initially thought, but I think I'll have a release ready for you guys within a week. I wanted to open a thread in case anyone has any questions regarding ABV, wanted to snag a beta release (limited supply, private beta), or wanted to bombard me with feature requests.

Here's the current list of features:

* Shows Reddit inbox in a Velox folder!
* Save user account information in Settings
* Special formatting and organizing: bolded headers, otherwise that would sort of defeat the purpose), very readable bodies
* Customizable amount of messages to load at a time (1-100 per Reddit API)
* Adjust inbox padding and header opacity with Settings sliders

All of this by its own means. That means you can use this without ever even opening Alien Blue, and a few more minor features, but they might not come before the initial release. I'm aiming for a $0.99 pricetag, if that sounds reasonable (sorry!).

1341034041.0,vtxho,Safari Download Manager: An Apologia.,DHowett,93,9,36,"Hey.

I know there's a good amount of people here who are - quite rightly - mad about SDM, and its all-too-timely release compared to the existence of Safari Download Enabler.

I'd like to clear things up

I'm just an engineer, misjudgements, miscalculations, and I misspeak, misquote, and misstep.

I realize the timing seems a little bit stupid, in the original SDM 2 thread) - but I'm not trying to make excuses. Sometimes people can't focus - sometimes I can't focus, even - but this isn't a sob story excuse either. It just happens. In the weeks, months, years I've been working on SDM with francis, sometimes the interest strikes me and sometimes it does not. It doesn't mean that I don't want it to exist, or don't want it to continue, or want to push it off on some third party so that they may benefit where I've left off - strictly because of the ownership and responsibility I feel for it.

The truth of the matter is that the code - you're quite correct (again, it now is: it appears to work unmodified on the iOS 6 betas, for example, which should guarantee a long life of support in the future.)

The developer of Safari Download Enabler did ask me to turn it over - I never replied, not because I don't like him or his project, simply because of that ownership and desire to actually do something with it. I didn't release it just now to spite him, to stomp all over him, or to move at all against him. I released it just recently because I promised June, and I wanted to meet that deadline.

I do want everybody in this community to be happy, and saying it sucked was certainly a harsh knee-jerk reaction (and I do regret it).

To be completely honest - it takes a lot of skill for anybody to do anything like this. He's not in any way a bad developer, in the end: the jailbreak userbase and the jailbreaking cause.

I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I hope that I get a chance to regain your trust,False,self,t5_2r8c5,False,,,t3_vtxho

* All info below is tentative and subject to last minute refinements

* @pod2g's 5.1.1 jailbreak+untether is working out great.  All devices are covered except for AppleTV3

 - @planetbeing stepped up and provided a kernel exploit that covers both of those.  Those two JBers are the bomb!

* The 5.1.1 A5 JB is very similar to the A5 5.0.1 JB.  @pimskeks has done a tremendous job supporting both 5.0.1 and 5.1.1 in absinthe

* Similar to 5.0.1, and redsn0w will all provide the same JB in different fashions.
 - timing is indeterminate.  Plans are for this week

* For those wishing to donate

&gt;Orangered is a dynamic, and presenting Reddit information, Orangered is the best way to stay on top of your inbox. After proving your identity, this jailbreak tweak (for all devices running iOS 5.0-6.1.2) will automatically check your Reddit inbox for unread messages and replies. Put in your ideal checking interval (how long you want Orangered to wait before checking your inbox again, in minutes or hours), save your information, and let Orangered works its magic. Never think about your new posts, or mentions again.

&gt;Currently supports Alien Blue, iAlien, amrc, Redditor, and Safari (just in case). Requests for more clients welcome!

Orangered will be available within a few days on the BigBoss repository for $0.99. It's been under some intense development for the past few weeks, or myself here. Thanks so much for waiting this long, and I promise not to disappoint.

Just like with *Alien Blue Velox*

**EDIT:** this also works great with tweaks like DietBulletin and OpenNotifier! Orangered adds a section in the main Notification settings area for your client of choice so you can work with the alerts like you would with any push notification.

&gt; All credits go to /u/JewishCowboy for the [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1bei2p/tweaks_released_in_march_2013/c9659b1).

&gt; This is an original /r/jailbreak event that will take place over the next month at the end of which we'll be able to determine which tweaks are the most popular in /r/jailbreak.

**How can I participate?**

&gt; * To vote
&gt; * /u/Connguy has suggested that people be allowed to create and submit their own prediction brackets. I've created /r/TweakMadness for that very purpose.

**Day 1 Matches**

&gt; We will be having matches 1-4 today in order to speed up the process. They will be open for approximately 48 hours. Tomorrow
&gt; The matches are:

&gt; 1. Intelliscreen X vs Killbackground
&gt; 2. Winterboard vs Bars
&gt; 3. AutoLSMusicControls vs Flex
&gt; 4. SBSettings vs f.lux

&gt; ~~Google Form to vote~~ Voting has been closed.

**Nomination Results**

&gt; This was much more successful than I anticipated it would be

&gt; * 236 total submissions
&gt; * 1885 total votes
&gt; * 303 total tweaks
&gt; * 165 tweaks received more than 1 vote
&gt; * 82 tweaks received 5 or more votes
&gt; * 43 tweaks received 10 ore more votes
&gt; * 16 tweaks received more than 25 votes
&gt; * 7 tweaks received more than 50 votes
&gt; * 94 was the highest followed by 90
&gt; * 2 tweaks were nominated that haven't been released (Badger and Velox)

&gt; I would have liked to release a complete list of tweaks nominated along with this post

&gt; Bracket Results @ [Challonge.com](http://challonge.com/tm2013). I decided on 64 instead of 32 tweaks in order to encompass as many tweaks as possible. The bracket has also been completely randomized to provide the fairest chance for all of the tweaks.

**/r/TweakMadness**

&gt; More details will be added to that subreddit later (after I get home from classes)

**Other Stuff**

&gt; I'm currently planning a supplementary competition that I'm sure a lot of people will be very interested in

So far, shuffle and repeat support. Once all that is in, we will work on implementing our new designs and ideas. Our current build is version 0.0.4. We plan on having 0.1 (all the features of default music with our new design and some new features) on April 20th.

Our official pricing: Alpha (v0.1-0.5) will be free on thebigboss repo.
Beta (0.5-0.9) will be 0.99 on thebigboss repo.
Final (1.0 onward) will be 1.99 on thebigboss repo and the official App Store. Features Apple won't allow will be unlockable in a free tweak on thebigboss. People who buy it on thebigboss will automatically get all the features.

Our thebigboss version will require verification with our servers. Without verification

People who purchase the beta for 0.99 will be able to update to the final version for .49 more. So the total cost for the beta testers will be 1.48

Thank you for showing your support and we are here to serve you.

Hey - back with an update. 

* Added non-emoji keyboards
* Added dictation images
* Added numberpad images
* Added a white popup key variant
* Realigned almost all the elements 
* Resized some of the popup keys
* Fixed 'ABC' text being too high on a few keyboards

*The shift key issue that has been pointed out cannot be fixed!*

Also, less than 3% of the people who downloaded donated. Not a big deal - but because of that I feel that all the PSDs and the updated keyboard elements are at least worth $.99! Even if the PSDs are of no use to you, I still think $.99 is very fair. 

This will let all the people who requested tiny little changes (i.e. lower case letters, etc.) to do it themselves or have someone they know do it. I simply do not have time with finals coming up to be able to deliver on that type of promise.

1372456369.0,1h9xlh,[Meta] Should tweak and theme devs be given custom flair?,hizinfiz,83,9,40,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1h78o1/subreddit_idea_and_oc_tag/) was brought up yesterday. It's not immediately clear to me from that post whether or not this was a popular idea (since we don't get reasons why upvotes/downvotes are given and there aren't many comments).

**So to ask again**

&gt; Should we assign custom flair to jailbreak tweak and theme devs?

&gt; Is this something that is even necessary?

&gt; At least personally

&gt; This would be something that only a mod can grant

&gt; It would have two main uses:

&gt; * A sort of ""verified"" status
&gt; * A way to give recognition to those who have contributed to the community

**What would it look like?**

&gt; It would be something very simple

&gt; In the future

**Who would get it?**

&gt; * Any user that has released a free or paid jailbreak tweak or app. (eg /u/insanj, /u/jontelang, /u/rpetrich, /u/joshmtucker)
&gt; * Any user that runs a Cydia repo. (eg /u/angelXwind
&gt; * Any user who has released a complete free or paid theme on Cydia. (eg /u/whitebaron
&gt; * Any user who has released a jailbreak tool. (eg /u/planetbeing

**Who would not get it?**

&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak blog or website.
&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak youtube channel.
&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak twitter/google+/other social media account.
&gt; * If you've released a theme on /r/iOSthemes

**Thoughts?**

EDIT: I installed it and it worked perfectly.

I noticed they changed the guide abit on the site to help with those who get errors. So I hope the translator still works as good as before.

Found this also if it will help someone.
