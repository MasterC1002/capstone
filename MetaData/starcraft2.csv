The post on TL:

There's no easy way to say this

After having him on our roster for nearly three years

To state the obvious, and we have developed a deep appreciation and respect for him as a person. We consider him a member of our family, and parting ways with him leaves us all with a very heavy feeling in our stomachs.

We have built our company as a players-first organization. This is reflected in a number of already well-known benefits that our players receive, and excellent financial support. And while these are all vital parts of taking a players-first approach, we believe that one of the most important ways to support professional gamers is to stay out of their way. 

As most of you are already aware, and we like to let our players find their own roles within the eSports storyline by showcasing the personalities they were born with. We have strict guidelines that regulate certain kinds of more extreme speech, and we take disciplinary action when those guidelines are violated, but for the most part, we stay out of the way. 

This is why it was never really an issue for us that Greg can be rude to his opponents in games, there's a very big difference between a player being disrespectful to an opponent in a ladder match, and a player being disrespectful to the entire community of people who, via their own enthusiasm and passion for the entertainment product he creates, actually make his profession possible.

The eSports industry, as a company, cannot and will not be supportive of anyone who does not show due respect and appreciation for the community that makes everything we do possible.

Thank you for your time

Sincerely

Alexander Garfield
CEO

Sorry for my bad english. I am from Brazil and I am 22y old. I grew in the suburb of São Paulo which is a great city (but expensive). I am from a modest family and I did everything I could to support them while studying. Many of my friends were playing football or were doing bad things while I was at the library.  

I did not enjoy this part of my life cause it was so hard to work

But I won a prize in a mathematics challenge which basically helped me to go to Paris to study more.    

This is a beautiful city but it's kinda weird for a poor foreigner like me. Everything is expensive and people mocked of how I try to talk. Hopefully the family with which I live help me to be a part of the city.
  
Some months ago I discovered Starcraft 2 and I made some friends. The good part is they are from Paris and I eventually hooked up with them. Now my two french best friends left France for their studies and I stopped Starcraft 2 to focus on my exam.
  
I have just discovered we can now play Starcraft 2 with anyone in the world and I can't wait to find any job to get Heart Of The Swarm to get some new friends. I am watching all the tournaments and top player stream and I can tell this game must be so funny to play.
  
Thanks to Blizzard for the UI rework (it is more social).  

**TLDR : I am from a poor family and hard work + SC2 helped me to focus on a right life. SC2 community is awesome because anyone can be a part of it. So please,False,self,t5_2qspc,1364137295.0,,,t3_1awy0r

Maybe this will help others too. I just copied and pasted all the images from the starcraft website into one image. For whatever team you play just have that sheet open during the game or printed out. I know the metagame is way more complex than this but this will give me a good start. Hope it helps.

Basically you upload your .SC2Replay files and I'll convert them into web replays.  My twist is I make recordings from 2 players perspectives and show em both to you on the same page (sync'd of course).

I have some other options as well

As a side note - my goal for this was to produce something that would scale decently with almost no $ investment (just my time).  Have this running on 1 ec2 micro,img) being served up by github pages.  Dynamic pages are being served directly from memcached via nginx module (pages are stored already gzipped).  I know here is probably not the forum, but if anyone is interested in the implementation details I'd be willing to share cuz I think some of concepts I came up with could help others looking to bootstrap their webapp.

Thanks in advance. First Reddit post so go easy on me.

1310346204.0,ilzsn,How does one improve mechanics?,blink00,36,15,48,"This post is inspired by Destiny and other skilled players' insistence on focusing on **mechanics** pre-platinum.

Also, seen from all sources, including redditors and TeamLiquid.

**What does *mechanics* mean?** My opinion:

**Macro**

* Use hotkeys.
* Use control groups.
* Never float resources. (Always spend your resources as much as you     
   can. When you have extra resources
   example
* Build enough gatherers. (2-3 per mineral patch
* Build enough supply so as to *never* get supply capped.
* Constantly build units.
* Expand when you saturate a base.
* Always spawn larvae/spread creep/use chronoboost/mules
* Invest in upgrades. (Thanks Schamus)
* Map control and awareness. (Gold/Platinum and up.)
* Scouting and game sense. (Platinum and up.)
* Build orders

**Micro**

* Minimize unnecessary clicking and use mouse accurately.
* Be able to macro while controlling units.
* Effective movement of units. (Gold/Platinum and up.) (Thanks Doof07)
* Effective use of unit abilities. (Gold/Platinum and up.)
* Army positioning during battles. (Platinum and up.)
* Try to keep your units busy. (Platinum and up.) (Jasminbulle)

--------------------

So, preferably starting with the top of the ""Macro"" list, and just focus on *that one aspect* for maybe 5 games against a computer, then 20 or more games. The desire to win sometimes gets in the way of a new skill, which is essentially your ego talking. If you can put your ego aside, you'll really improve.

I go into detail about improving each aspect in the following paragraphs.

A couple things first:

Macro is more important than Micro. The first two bullets under micro ought to be learned as you are learning the first few bullets of macro.

I may be missing some items

**Macro**

**First:** Find one SIMPLE build and just do that. Use that build as the basis for learning the fundamentals. Also

**Hotkeys:** Play many games against the computer where *all you're trying to do* is to use hotkeys. 

Switch to the grid system if you can. It's under the hotkey options. Grid keeps all the hotkeys in a neat place on one side of your keyboard. Once you feel you are never clicking to build units, you're good.

You can use the spacebar to quickly move to the most recent alert - like a battle. You may have to rebind this. (Thanks

**Control Groups:** Play five games adding *just one* control group. Then add another.

You make a control group by selecting a unit/building or group of units/buildings

How you organize your groups is really up to you

* 1-3 Important buildings.
* 4-6 Important fighting units.
* 7-0 Builders

If you are using Grid

You can use shift + # to add to control groups. You can use control + click on unit icon to select all of one unit. Thanks

You can use Tab to cycle through buildings or units in one control group. For example, and other upgrade buildings to 3. By pressing tab, I can cycle between the different buildings.

**Never float resources/build enough miners/build enough supply/constantly build units:** Play twenty games where your only focus is to take care of one of these.

Watch your replays

**Note on gatherers: According to this [graph linked by Artha_SC](http://i.imgur.com/sw8lw.png), it is best to expand as you approach 16 gatherers on minerals, but if you have more, it's decent. Definitely don't go over 24 gatherers on minerals (3 per patch), though, as the extra gains are severely decreased.

(Thanks, Eirhead, and Clbull.)

So, you can produce an equal amount of workers from both bases and get to saturation (16 workers) or full saturation (24 workers) faster. (Thanks, saranagati)

**Map Control:** Use units/structures to give yourself vision of key map areas. For example, zerglings, creep tumors, and Xel'Naga Towers to see what's going on. **Watch the mini-map at all times.**

--------------------

**Micro**

**Minimize unnecessary clicking and use the mouse accurately:** When you move a unit somewhere

You can practice by clicking your control group for the Nexus/Hive/CC, then speed up. This will improve accuracy and will help with overall micro. (Tip from Day9.)

**Effective movement of units and use of unit abilities:** Find a unit test map and look up YouTube videos on micro for different units of your race. Get gold in some of the Challenge Missions that come with the game. They teach a lot of micro and unit positioning.

**Macro while moving units:** On a build order test map

**Army positioning:** Get Gold in some of the Challenge Missions. Look up videos on YouTube. Watch the battles of important games.

**Keep units busy:** Kill rocks to gold, i.e. a vulnerable part of your main.

Then I saw my enemy fooling around in my base with a drone - I didn't think anything of it, so I reacted the same way I would had someone tried to hatchery spine crawler rush me - I sent all of my drones to destroy it.

It took a lot of time to do this, holy mother of dog, 5-6 little crawley thingies come out of it and kill half of my workers.

1325768186.0,o3we3,/r/starcraft2's noobie guide!,achristes,23,6,12,"Now

(If you have you want to ask questions in-game

Zerg

- Learn to keep your injects up

- Try to determine when it is safe to make drones

- Dont be afraid to make spines when you have a ton of minerals

- Don't allin vs terran

- Don't try to learn pro-build orders that you clearly are incapable of doing

- Don't have more then 75-ish drones

Protoss

- I think in the lower leagues

- Make probes and pylons

- Make a proxy pylon when being aggressive

- Use your chronoboost

- Learn to forcefield and you win

- Zealots with +1weapons two shot lings without armor upgrades.

- Learn to make a gateway/cybercore/zealot wall vs zerg

Terran

- Basicly same as toss

- Constant SCV production

- Get an orbital

- Don't ever engage on creep

- Learn to make a depot/rax/depot wall vs zerg

- Learn to scout. This is true of all three races

- Learn your tools. The strength of Terran is adaptability. Terran has a lot of different tools at its disposal, when to go bio, and when to go air.

- Learn your builds and practice them (this is another general one

- Building placement. Every supply depot should go where it will be helpful. They're awesome because they can be raised and lowered as needed

- Learn about add-ons. Notice how much pros move their buildings around between a couple addons? There are good reasons for it. Though they're cheap, but consider why a building should have one add on or another and what the best way to get that add on there is as the game progresses.

- Don't be afraid to scan if you really don't know what is going on with your opponent. As you improve, if you really can't get a good scout, information is the most valuable commodity.

- As a general rule to start with, factories, or starports. Getting into the late game and sitting on a ton of money? Build more production so that when you lost a lot of units in a battle, you can rebuild them quickly. This can be the difference between winning and losing against a Z or P, since they can generally build stuff faster than you.

It would be awesome with some help with the toss and terran guides

Also, it could be anything because it is after all low leagues, and those guys are crazy. Short version, scouting is really unreliable in the lower leagues, and players are often very unpredictable.

This is not to bash noobies, you don't have the necessary mechanics. Basicly all you need to do is to mass games and learn your race, be it injecting, muling, chronoing etc. Learn it and spend your money and your going the right direction. This is not CoD, or some brainless shooter. You will not know how to play this game from the first online game unless you have some RTS experience.
And for god's sake, Blistering Sands etc) in novice version with a slower gamespeed. Learn to play at Faster from the beginning and it will be alot easier.

My initial impression was that the game is very defensive. You can negate early rushes with your commander and point defenses are very powerful.

Then I went online and watched some pro player VODs... WOW. Those guys makes the game seem more like a war sim. The macro is just insane and there's so much going on... There doesn't seem to be a very monotone meta game either. It can end in many different ways, lategame nukes, experimental units etc... What really impressed me was how much teching really pays off. A tech 3 assault bot can demolish a whole tech 2 army, forcing the other player to fall back.

The game seem to be very macro oriented

I also find the resources interesting. You fight over key mass collecting points

That's just my initial thoughts. Let me know what you guys think of it from a constructive POV. ""lol sc is clearly superior fuck supcom"" is not constructive.

edit: this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrWm1LRBEw) is a good explaination on how a pro plays the game.

My name is Tyler Sawyer and have been an avid fan of video games for the majority of my life and am currently top 20 masters. I am also have been doing Tae Kwon Do since I was 3

To keep things short, I am willing to share my knowledge with others in order for them to take their game play to the next level. I am currently in the process of creating an eBook for everybody to read and will be posting updates on material presented in the book on a website.

I was hoping to get some feedback from you all to see what parts of Starcraft you struggle with mentally in order for me to address them in my book. Below is a small except from one of the early chapters and a link if you are interested in learning more.

Thanks!


&gt;The path to becoming a successful progamer is the same with any high level sport; one must practice and perfect their art little by little until every facet of their game becomes flawless. The ultimate goal for any player is to hone their skills until their actions and reactions become natural


&gt;The most important aspect in succeeding as a gamer is to become aware of how your brain processes the information it is presented. As humans, if we look at the 4-gate in Zerg vs Protoss in the early days of Starcraft 2, there were plenty of cries of imbalance due to the fact that Zerg players did not understand how to react after seeing the given situation. But over a period of time, they learned how to read the tells of a 4-gate and build units and structures accordingly. In League of Legends, new players have a hard time until they understand the mechanics and abilities of all of the characters. Understanding and experience are forms of adaptation that allow our brains to quickly and subconsciously make decisions.

&gt;Throughout our lives, it is a reaction to information coming into your system.

1339785349.0,v3t7c,I am seriously struggling to play Terran. Can anybody give me any answers on how I should play this race.,Clbull,17,4,26,"**NOTE: THERE IS SOME CRASS LANGUAGE HERE. EXCUSE MY WORDING

I don't have any replays to give but I can describe a lot of my problems in the game as follows:

**TvZ:**

I cannot pull off any effective timing pushes. I have tried Hellion Expand (as in the safe factory before CC variation, 10 - 20 mutas would come in and fucking rape my SCVs.

I have even tried to forget the idea of a timing push and get a fast third (10 - 12 mins) but often get destroyed either by a timing push or by ultra-lategame Zerg where no matter how many tanks I have (and I can have 14+ tanks at one time)

**TvP:**

Similar problem to TvZ. I cannot do any pressure in the early game because more often than not Sentries will shut it down. I try going drop heavy in the midgame but often the Protoss turns it into an unwinnable base race with a Chargelot or Colossus push.

The ultra-late game is unwinnable for me

Then there's dealing with Protoss aggression. Sometimes their aggression options are ridiculously overpowered

**TvT:**

Do not get me started on this matchup. The same shit happens every game. Either I get contained and cannot break it then ragequit

**Generally:**

In the later game

Oh yeah and I also need to use another two actions per SCV to centre the camera upon a mining base AND use Shift+right click to queue up a command where the SCV moves back to the mineral line after building.

Terran need to actually micro their buildings

And I find Terran far more micro-intensive than any other race. With bio, engage with a really good concave and make sure no huge hits land. And this is just to survive a mid/late game engagement. Furthermore, I have to drop pressure as well if I want to even remotely claw ahead.

For example, is there a button I can hit to cycle through all three of them so I can larvae inject better? Same with Gateways for example, if I wanted to vary units out of each building faster.

Alot of terrans problems vs zerg lategame seems like it is some kind of mass ling reinforcement (obviously this is not the case with all strategies)
My idea is when you see a zerg move out drop some helions in his bases (or run by) and target the larvae. Helions roast larvae and they stack like crazy when you have 10 or so sitting around.
This may be very micro intesive, but I believe if you can pull this off things would be much easier for terran lategame.

If anyone would like to check this strat out and you are on EU server my ID is Inconsistent.991 and I would love to see how this works out.

I feel like I know a lot about the game. I know strengths/weaknesses of individual units, but something happens when I'm ready to hit that ""find a match"" button.

When I want to play, I end up usually pulling up a stream, or try to play a 2's game with my friend. Or I just play another game altogether.

When I DO hit the find match button, especially if they scout extra early. In my mind, I know the earliest marines or lings can show up at my base, but panic sets in. I do stupid things like not only supply block myself, but completely forget a cyb. core... I mean COME ON.

There are some games where I'll let my macro slip because I'm in a panic, all I know is that with those sort of mistakes, I lose. After 4-5 games, I tend to calm down and start playing like I should, then I win games (although I still feel nervous). My palms sweat, I sit up straight in my chair and I am a focused motherfucker when I play. I have less than 100 1v1 wins and I'm ranked mid-gold currently.

The past two seasons though, I play 2v2 with my friend who plays (he's a plat Terran), and we kick ass. I feel ZERO pressure while playing, I'm relaxed, and I do what I'm supposed to.

It's not that I'm afraid of losing. When I lose, the first time I played, I had the entire day off, so I was sitting at my computer doing other things. I was wanting to play SC2 so bad, but it took a full 7 hours before I talked myself into playing. After a while, I did well enough, but it took that long for me to actually play.

I had a chance to get on my company's AHGL team a while back, but I didn't make the team because I was silver. I can't blame them, I can only blame myself.

I'm not new to player v.s. player games. I played PvP in MMO's (namely WoW, etc... I've been playing games all my life, I don't understand what is so different about Starcraft.

I'm convinced that this is a psychological thing

Does anyone have any insight or advice at all? I know I sound like a pussy, and I've missed out on hundreds, if not thousands of games, because I simply let anxiety take over when it's time to play.

TLDR: Get very nervous when it's time to queue for ladder, sweating, heart racing, etc).",,False,self,False,t3_10b5pk

When I first tried out Zerg, but never as Zerg, so most of the mechanics were pretty new to me. So, one of the hardest things for me to pick up was creep and how to spread it. For the longest time (I think until I hit gold league) I spawned a new tumor EVERY time I wanted to push my creep out. I had no idea I could select previous tumors to move them forward. So, I always built one queen to spawn a tumor and my creep spread was horrendous because of my derpiness. I finally realized after watching pro matches how creep spread works and it was a completely epiphanic moment for me. In my defense, how was I supposed to know that?

I played the game, I had waited, impatiently, 365 days for Brood War. Months before that Christmas I had peaked and looked in my parents room for my present. I couldn't find it, when, finally, I saw receipts. Receipt for Brood War was amongst the pile of gifts long forgotten now. For months, wondering what awaited me with the expansion I now cherish as much as the Original

Starcraft saw me through boy scouts, and it was there when i was shattered because I was discharged. Through the darkest parts of my life it was there. In 2007, months after I was discharged, and months after I had lost hope because of it, I saw it. The announcement, I had watched anxiously as I had watched for Ghost and other announcements for it. That week i placed a reservation at Gamestop. Five dollars. Five dollars that would otherwise buy me my new addiction to either smoking or drinking. Two vices that I kept because I could not cope with the world as I should have. The best five dollars I ever spent because for a moment it kept me sane and kept me healthy. For the moment. The cinematic you released early on, I watched over and over again. Even now, because I still get excited

2010, You announced a collectors edition. That month I was 100 dollars short on my bills. Oh well. This was worth it. And for months I impatiently awaited much as I did for Brood War, obsessing over it. Combing over every detail you had put out for this game, every cinematic and trailer you released (as well as pirates released). I was so impatient I actually pirated your game a week before I got a beta invite so I could just experience it. I'm ashamed to say that. Because I have standards. If it's something I respect and love, I do not pirate, I buy. Unfortunately, I could not help myself. 

Finally, there is no midnight and I could not fly out to any of your conventions or midnight releases, I'm poor.), That day I did something unusual. Instead of racing home to install and play, I spent an hour doing errands.....maybe I was too afraid to play it? It was a dream perhaps? After all, I had many dreams similar, and I woke up from them. Then, I installed the game

You see, they let me have it because I said i wanted it. It was the same chair that comforted me as I played Starcraft and Brood War years ago. I moved it downstairs to the same location I played Starcraft and Brood War. Unfortunately, the computer is less than a year old, the desk younger than Brood War. But it's the same chair. The same chair I sat in, overjoyed and happy. 

The same chair I sit in still

If at all, after all of the real war, and all of the crazy #!%! I've seen as a combat medic, and as a teenager. Starcraft, I would say, is the closest thing I have to religion and comfort. 

And for that

I will buy your two expansions, in any form, will always make me happy, and give me a reason to live. 

Thank you Blizzard.

When Toss comes with a pylon/cannon drop at my natural I find it pretty difficult to defend against with drones. I've defended it successfully a few times with 5 drones attack the pylon. The problem I find is when they place it behind the mineral line it's quite hard to surround with drones.

My question: how do i defend against cannon rush at my natural with just drones - when it's placed behind the mineral line - I've scoutted it earlier enough. 

Any vids would be great.

1. You can't stop it with 15 hatch (or it's near impossible).

I have no RTS experience so I approached the game like a university class

I was watching a Day9 episode and he was talking about getting into SC2 and basically said don't worry about anything just go play. So I turned off the video and played my first multiplayer match!

I ended up winning 2 of my placement matches which was pretty cool

So I have a couple of questions now. I noticed a ""leave league"" button

I've only played my 5 placement matches and 2 or 3 games so far.

NExt question is about HotS. Should I buy this now? Is the pool of people on WoL maybe why I'm getting matched against higher players? Or is there still plenty of activity with WoL and I shouldn't worry about it at this time?

I don't want to give the false impression that I actually know anything about the game. I built a Spire because I thought I needed it to make Spore Crawlers when something invisible was killing my stuff. My solution to missing injects is a 2nd hatch so when I do remember I can vomit twice. I also unintentionally play like the goal is to finish the game with the most unspent minerals &gt;.&gt;

Anyway it's a slow Sunday and I'm just sharing my intro into SC2 and kind of wondering about HotS.

* At what point are players considered ""good"" I assume its Master's League but what really sets them apart from a Diamond player? 

* What should I be looking to improve on realistically? Right now I'm playing Zerg. I average like 150-200 apm and don't usually miss injects but my creep spread is almost always terrible

* What is the proper saturation for a base? I've heard 16 drones on minerals but I've heard different numbers thrown around and I see more on streams sometimes.

* Other than getting higher on the ladder what are things I should be noticing about myself to see that I'm getting better?

Hi

This is sort of a story of inspiration from me

I met GamaniaSen at a Barcraft event at brass monkey in Taipei Taiwan. I'm a caucasian that studies Chinese and International Security Studies

This was profound to me because he is a world-famous pro and he was a native speaker of Chinese. But frankly

When I met him
""Hi
""Wa! Your Chinese is really good!""
""Yeah

Besides him, respectively. I asked them, ""What does it take to be a caster here in Taiwan?"" and they replied, ""We want someone who is at least diamond on the TW/KR server and is able to speak Chinese.""

This immediately inspired me. It put me into a an amazingly good mood the next day and I was grinding the ladder with a mood that is comparable to Day[9]'s enthusiasm. I lost maybe only one game that day on the Korean ladder, and I followed through with full mechanical and reactive play. I play zerg.

Since then

Before I left Taiwan

I don't know how to put it... It just put me in an insanely good mood for the longest time,,False,self,t5_2qspc,1342494070.0,,True

So I was playing as T in a (gold) TvZ last night on Antiga Shipyard and I was going to go fast banshee so I went gas first

I teched to siege, 3 marines and a scv and dropped on his ledge. I sieged upand used the medivac to get sight. I would also use my wicked gold level macro to pop the marines onto the ledge to lure units over, then pick them up and return them to safety while the tank took out the lings. The SCV kept the medivac healthy (as it was being hit by a queen) and I managed to snipe a few overlords, queen, and lings and disrupt his game pretty decently with a small amount of units.
Eventually he cleared it with mutas, marauders and a handful of tanks.

When he cleared it

My question is, so I was able to make that entire side of his base worthless because he couldn't clear out the medivac. Queens got killed by siege, and medivac kept being heled by my single scv.

I suppose I'm technically not a ""newbie"" per se by playtime

My first big problem comes with the cannon-rush. I've been reading all over the place for help on this one, but even when I succeed, I still just lose. Whether it's from bad micro or what have you, my opponent will *always* get a fast two pylons, then run his probe off. If I chase the probe, he brings in another one or two to build cannons once the pylons finish, and if I attack the pylons, then I see a cancel followed by cannons and pylons. I believe I read somewhere that

Also from Protoss,"" and I've found it to be true, but I find that the wall-offs that I see are nearly certain death to a force of around 5 immortals. In my experience, around the fifth immortal is when the void rays start approaching numbers capable of dealing with any feasible tech-switch, and pushing with less than four immortals generally ends with me losing.

Relatedly, this will usually keep me on low bases, and prevent me from doing the scouting and aggression that I'd like to do against a void-ray build. Is there something I'm not doing properly here?


The rest of my problems come from zerg. I am increasingly finding myself in a situation much like the previous when against zerg: A roach/ling army at the foot of my natural's ramp. I can't really expand to a third, without fail, to my being overrun by mass units, and whatever I make to deal with the force is crushed rapidly immediately afterwards by whatever he makes to do so, generally mutalisks. I've tried things like HT/Archon/Zealot with 3-4 immortals, but instead of mutalisks, that generally leads to mass roach, which aspect should I be working on? Composition

My other zerg problem is the 8/10-pool. I always build a gateway as quickly as I can afford to without cutting probes versus zerg(generally at 13), I tried a cannon-defense upon scouting it, but the zerglings took out the still-building cannon fairly easily. Perhaps I was slow with the cannon, but I don't like the idea of opening with a forge for some reason. I generally feel much more secure with a gateway. How would you recommend dealing with these builds?

Last one(I promise) is fast mass-marauder. I've tried responding with void-rays, stalkers, chargelots, sentries, what have you, but I always end up losing, either when he makes a medivac and gets past my force-fields

Any help is greatly appreciated. =)",self,t5_2qspc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft2/comments/v6al2/i_am_a_newbie_protoss_player_who_keeps_dying_to/

So reddit I come asking for your help. With my low activity I have no recent replays to cast. Do any of you have a replay you would like casted? Please send it to me at spookycast@yahoo.com. I will be starting back casting tonight so expect new videos this weekend.

Thanks in advanced

P.S. 

For those of you who don't know me i'm Spooky. My youtube channel is all about helping players get better at SC2. I cast all level games talking about strategy, I cast replays to show the average player making average mistakes. My view is you can't learn from the best when you are making different mistakes.

DOTA is amazing but it's a little stressful 'cause you depend on a team and the community is not only bad but also unavoidable since the game forces interaction upon you. In short

I've been following the SC2 scene since beta and I'm subscribed to everything Day[9]

I better cut off to the questions:

1) Is Brood War worth picking up again for practice provided I can still run it on a modern PC? I'll have to save money for the game and I wouldn't mind replaying.

2) Did Blizzard issue some kind of bundle so it's worth picking up the expansion as well?

3) Does the game have a healthy ladder / comp scene?

4) Are the WOL / HOTS campaigns fun? Hey

5) Is the game balanced? Is HOTS balanced?

6) Is it worth downloading that kind-of-a-test client thing from the Blizzard website?

7) Is the community alright? The DOTA community really took a toll on my sanity

He likes the maps where you're separated and have more of a corner of the map type spawn. Whereas I prefer we both spawn next to each other in one large base. I also hate when our one large base has multiple ramps. I think the one base idea gets rid of the 2 Zerg 6 pool or double bunker rush or double cannon rush. The cheese stuff that you see in 2v2 is avoided because it's one ramp to wall off. Much easier IMO.

On battle.net I am known as RuneK.

Next week on Monday I will be hosting a Bronze2Gold 2v2 tournament for all those leagues to enter. Later that week I will be holding a 2v2 tournament for Plat2Masters. I will stream and cast the whole event. I will do this every week until I find a reason not to. I have support from a small group of people

If I find that people are interested and want to join and/or watch I will eventually hold a cash prize for such a tournament. As it stands there is still a chance to win a cash prize for people who win multiple times as per the rules.

Please review the rules and provide feedback. Please join

I have a chance to have sponsors for this event but I need to prove to them that people are interested in such an event. If I can get that interest

Soon I hope to have custom maps made just for this tournament (that may catch Blizzard's eye for the ladder

1328598129.0,pee18,Night Owl Brawl Tournament Bonanza coming soon! Fun available for everybody! ♥,kravhen,7,0,3,"Greetings r/starcraft2!

The name’s Kravhen. I run the Night Owl Brawl tournaments, Night Owl Brawl #12, is here: http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5351-kravhen-s-night-owl-brawl-12. You can also subscribe to the Chronic Facture tourney group to keep up with the night owls and other tournaments hosted by my clanmates.

But on this post’s main announcement!

Due to popular demand and the desire to celebrate the 15 first editions of the night owl brawl, times, rules and most things are tentative for now; that is, every detail is subject to change but this should give you all an idea of what’s coming up!

**1. LOWER LEAGUE SWAG TOURNAMENT:**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5455-night-owl-brawl-lower-league-swag-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5455-night-owl-brawl-lower-league-swag-edition)

This tournament came into existence because many lower league players have complained that they like playing in night owl tourneys, this is your time to shine! Ideas for prize include the possibility of coaching! Come play and showcase your lower league creativity! If the tournament is casted, it’ll also give players the chance to check the VODs afterwards and see how they can improve.

**2. 2V2 TEAMS TOURNAMENT:**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5454-night-owl-brawl-2v2-teams-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5454-night-owl-brawl-2v2-teams-edition)

Self-explanatory. People sometimes brought their friends, why not let friends be friends? Thus, the 2v2 tournament is born. Note that you can sign up teams of up to 3 players. This means you can be up to 3 in a team, but you will only send 2 players at a time for each match obviously. 3v3 and 4v4 may be chaotic most of the time, but 2v2 can be very competitive and very fun, so there it is! Extra reason of allowing 3 players per team is if someone doesn’t show up, the 2v2 team still functions.

**3. CLANS &amp; BUDDIES TOURNAMENT (TEAM SERIES):**
[http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5352-night-owl-brawl-1v1-clans-buddies-edition](http://www.z33k.com/games/starcraft2/tournaments/5352-night-owl-brawl-1v1-clans-buddies-edition)

1v1 team series! What is that, except you sign up teams of 3 players. Each team sends in 1 player to fight the opposing team’s player. Winner stays for the next match (if Best of 3 or 5), loser must be switched out for another player of that team. A player who lost is “dead” and cannot play again in the same series. instead This format is great for buddies, cliques and of course clans who want to get their crew’s name out there through a competitive 1v1 tournament. So bring your squad and come play!

Hi guys!

I'm Brazilian and I'm replaying the campaign right now. But I'm facing again this old problem I would like to solve before HotS is out.
I bought my SC2 copy in Brazil, I downloaded Starcraft II in English, got into the Campaign folder, copied the file enUS.SC2Assets, changed its name to ptBR.SC2Assets, pasted it over my own Campaign folder and voilà... Starcraft 2 in English.

So what is the problem? Problem is

1) SOME of the lines are still in Portuguese. Having Tychus or Horner starting to speak Portuguese in the middle of an English conversation is awkward;

2) The lip-sync is ruined. Actually
Unit quotes are perfect.

Although this (ironically) could fit better in r/firstworldproblems

I played a few league games and was placed into bronze. After reading guides and watching mechanics videos for a couple of days I know what I should be doing and just need practice adapting and executing these as zerg. I guess you're not supposed to learn in league because you can dig yourself into a hole as far as rankings go (but if I don't really care should i continue to play in bronze anyways?), or if you have any advice about this let me know please! Thanks!
