As a young driver I think that this subreddit has been immensely helpful to make me a safer driver. Nothing is gonna help you drive safer than seeing the consequences of not doing so everyday. I rewind and analyze each video to see what errors have been made and how it could have been avoided. Some examples:

* I find myself putting a lot more distance between me and the car in front of me

* Slow down at intersections

* Don't cross snow tracks at high speed.

* If a car looses control in front of you and a collision seems imminent
I notice this happens frequently.

* Don't cross 2 lanes at once. Do it one by one.

* GODDAMN MIRRORS

Anyway, and sirens were approaching - within a minute the ambulance was there (I am unsure when the accident happened so it could have been 5 or 10 minutes before I walked outside!)

Anyway...  Plenty of the videos here show the smashing, after the fact, I got to see the paramedics, fire fighters and police in action securing the scene, pushing the vehicles away, securing the body and administering first aid.  The babies crying in the cars involved, etc.  

In this case, didn't move at all - that was the scariest part was he just lay on the road completely immobile.  One minute he's on his way home from work, the next...  

At one point I saw his chest rising and falling in really ragged

Anyway, bounced into the other lane travelling in the same direction, then gone under a car in that lane before sliding to a stop underneath the original car he'd initially struck.

I like to think I am prepared, now it seems he's probably a paraplegic (though whether permanent or not, or whether I just misread the scene, is another matter)

Anyway

I hope the guy survives and can walk again.",self,t5_2tjwt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/carcrash/comments/1f7gmd/witnessed_the_aftermath_of_a_motorcycle_car/
