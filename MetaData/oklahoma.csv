Unfortunately


Please contact members of the House and urge them to vote NO on HB 2097 as passed by the Senate unless and until Senator Johnson's Floor Amendment

-------------

If enacted

* Ban e-cigarette sales to minors

* Tax sales of “vapor products” (e-cigarettes and cartridges) and “tobacco-derived products” (e-liquid and cartomizers containing nicotine) at 5 cents per 1.48 ml of liquid.

* Require e-cigarette retailers to obtain a license to sell tobacco products and abide by 30+ pages of regulations governing how tobacco products are sold.

* Make it a criminal offense for consumers to buy e-cigarettes online.

-------------

**Now

RJ Reynolds (which makes Camel cigarettes, etc. and will soon be marketing its own e-cigarette) is continuing to push for Senator Johnson's bill.  Why is **Camel Cigarettes** encouraging Oklahoma legislators to make it harder for Oklahoma e-cigarette stores to buy product?  Why is Reynolds trying to ban Internet sales?  Simple -- it will benefit Camel, and other tobacco companies, by making it harder for adult consumers to purchase premium e-cigarettes.    

On April 9, the House Health Committee wisely voted unfavorably on the bill.

Senator Rob Johnson is now attempting to railroad SB 802 through the Oklahoma Senate by attaching it as an amendment to an entirely unrelated bill

CASAA is requesting that Oklahoma citizens come out even more strongly against FLOOR AMENDMENT #2 TO HB 2097 than they did Senator Johnson's previous bill to tax e-cigarettes

There will be no public hearing before Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 comes up for a vote

**Here is a list of House member email addresses

donarmes@okhouse.gov, scott.biggs@okhouse.gov, lisajbilly@okhouse.gov, gusblackwell@okhouse.gov, mikebrown@okhouse.gov, david.brumbaugh@okhouse.gov, ed.cannaday@okhouse.gov, mike.christian@okhouse.gov, anncoody@okhouse.gov, leedenney@okhouse.gov

**Some creativity boosters:**

* Inform them you OPPOSE Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 because it would impose an unwarranted sin tax on electronic cigarette sales, and make criminals out of thousands of Oklahoma citizens who purchase e-cigarettes online. 

* Remind the Senators that this amendment is virtually identical to SB 802

* Inform the legislators that by taxing vapor product liquid at 5 cents per 1.48 ml of liquid

* Explain the vast majority of Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 is unnecessary and will have unintended consequences on Oklahoma-based small businesses and Oklahoma e-cigarette users.  Additionally

* Note that the citizens of Oklahoma do not support new taxes and burdensome regulations. Further explain that imposing such wide-ranging laws on e-cigarette sales only serves to protect cigarette markets and will hurt small businesses in Oklahoma. 

* Explain that there is no evidence that any significant number of youth are using e-cigarettes

* Inform them that Floor Amendment #2 to HB 2097 would not only require e-cigarette sellers to obtain a license to sell tobacco

* Direct them to the  [CASAA.org](http://blog.casaa.org/2013/04/call-to-action-oklahoma-again-tries-to.html)

**You can donate/volunteer via the [Oklahoma Red Cross](http://www.okc.redcross.org/Donate_Now.php).  They may have more information about volunteering though (i.e. schedules/shifts

**UPDATE 18 (Sunday)**  I'm sorry once again for not being able to update this for as long as I wanted to; power went out here.  There has been a confirmed number (thus far) of 5 fatalities, some people are still missing.  There are multiple counties joining in the search and rescue for the people of Woodward.  The tornado sirens did not go off due to the storm approaching too quickly, along with a malfunction (lightning strike).  Police and other emergency officials have mentioned to keep calling relatives/friends there to a minimum due to it jamming their lines, so TEXTING would be the next best thing.  I know I'd probably try a few more times before giving it a break.  I hope that everyone else is okay, and if I weren't so far away, I know I'd be right there with the search and rescue teams helping them.  Donations are also being accepted, take any donations to the Living Word Fellowship Church.  They are also looking for any help they anyone can provide.  Thanks again y'all

So

First of all

Here was [our route through the state.](http://i.imgur.com/5FeM9Gg.png) I was happy that it gave us a good view of all parts of the state: the panhandle, Central and NE. Sorry, SE part of the state. I really wanted to see the World's Largest Peanut, but it was out of the way :(

It might seem droll to you guys, I was super excited to finally see one. *Then*, it just got absurd. I felt like I had rolled into the ""bad part of town"" and was being attacked by tumbleweeds.  

**Incidentally

Anyway, so keep an eye out for it when I finally post the video! 

We also really liked the wall murals in the small towns we drove through (Kingfisher, El Reno). I wish we could have gotten some pictures of them, but we were racing against the clock (sunset) to get to Hennessey for our picture – we didn't make it and had to take a dark picture. 

On that part of the drive

We did get to drive along part of the Historic Route 66 through El Reno on our way to Hennessey. That was a nice experience. I wish we could have seen the statue of the Model T in Tulsa, it seems like we were in a hurry that whole trip...

We ended up spending the night in downtown OKC. Speaking of downtown OKC... **what's up with everything closing at 9 PM??** The only place we could find that was open was Wedge Pizzeria, definitely go try it! I would definitely say it was in the top five pizzas I've ever had.

The next morning in OKC

While we weren't able to see the OKC bombing memorial, see the state capitol building and the ~~ridiculous~~ awesome oil derrick.

On our way out of the state

**Finally

1. We saw some ""squiggles"" on the road in a few places (OKC

2. How do Indian nations work? We drove through a few nations on the way. Who does law enforcement in those areas? If I'm speeding and a police office wants to pull me over,,False,self,t5_2qtnt,False,,True

They took my two Rockford Fosgate P1 12"" subwoofers, and a 1000 Watt amp, also they took two items of little value, but huge sentimental value to me, which would be an airsoft gun and a nerf gun that my friend gave to me before he left for the military.

Pass along to everyone as needed.


Good morning.

We're still very concerned about the severe weather potential today and especially tomorrow. I'll provide a more detailed weather update later this morning

- It is very unusual for the Storm Prediction Center to issue a High
Risk outlook for the day two (tomorrow) period
&lt;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html&gt; . But as we always say, moderate or high - you need to pay close attention and check the weather often!

- We are concerned about the potential for dangerous storms tomorrow affecting large numbers of people who aren't in their normal home or work locations. The Red-White game at OU in the afternoon and the Southwest Street Rod Nationals in OKC are just two examples of large gatherings of people who will be very vulnerable to severe weather. Be sure event organizers in your jurisdiction know about the severe weather threat and that they think about their plan to receive warnings and to keep people safe.

- The exact timing of storms is still in question. Unlike last May 24th
when storms fired before 3pm, storms may be fast-moving, making storm spotting operations very difficult and more dangerous than usual.

- We will be providing lots of safety and preparedness information on
our Facebook &lt;http://www.facebook.com/US.NationalWeatherService.Norman.gov&gt;  and Twitter &lt;https://twitter.com/#%21/nwsnorman&gt;  pages and you should feel free to share anything we post through your own social media accounts

I've attached a document we've shared on Facebook that outlines some general tornado safety tips to help people get prepared. Our goal is to get people to do what they need to do to be ready today so it'll be easier to be safe tomorrow.

I'll be in touch through the day
&lt;http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/&gt;  for the latest information

**EDIT:** Some additional info my wife got from former OKC TV meteorologist Aaron Tuttle who now works for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar group at the FAA

URGENT UPDATE: I just finished looking over the morning computer models and things have gone from bad to worse. The trend continues to show grave concern. We are in store for a 2 day outbreak of deadly tornadoes beginning this afternoon. There is a High Risk from the SPC tomorrow but there should be one today as well, but that's not to say there won't be short lived quick ones before dusk. I do expect them. The long track long lived ones may hold off until after dusk when we are all most vulnerable. The storms will continue through much of the night over the state before ending by day break. The next round for Saturday still appears to hold off until late in the day, near dusk for another evening event. As the 1st round will work over the atmosphere to help stabilize it. This is the kind of situation where unfortunately people die. There's only so much you can do to take responsibility for yourself and loved ones. For one, find a sturdy shelter, two get a NOAA weather radio and pay attention, and three pray. I have a very bad feeling about this. I hope I am wrong though. Too many things are pointing to one of the nastiest events we've seen over this region in a long time. Also, OK is not alone in this. N TX up to NE and points East will be affected also. This will be a storm system for the record books folks. I don't often get worked up over events until I see a setup that looks to take lives from strong tornadoes such as EF4s and EF5s, just prepare. Be safe! ",t5_2qtnt,True

I've already given four presentations in two botany classes at the high school I graduated from and they went well. I brought several live plants that many of the students had never seen before.

I have other projects in mind that I can do with the organization, entertaining and can be used in classrooms.

**EDIT: added the mission statement/plan for everyone to read.**

&gt;**Preface**
&gt;    The major defining characteristic of humans is intelligence. We are, but we have a problem; Too few of us know enough about the world to be able to make educated decisions about our current and future pursuits towards resolving these problems and many us do not appreciate the world around us to care about it.

&gt;    Our future survival on this planet and in the universe depends on our ability to solve problems and care for our environment. It is then our most important goal to educate ourselves so that we understand and appreciate the world around us so that we can properly respond to our problems.

&gt;**The mission**
&gt;   The organization is a non-profit, access and understanding of science, history, culture and the world around them in general While promoting critical thinking and intellectual development. We believe that the root of many problems that we as a species currently face are driven by a lack of education, appreciation and understanding of the world around us.

&gt;   As a global resource we will act as a compendium of human knowledge and experience to provide for the betterment of humanity through education and as a local resource we will act to use our knowledge and experience to serve the community and assist in whatever capacity we may be desired or needed.

&gt;As an educational resource in both a physical and digital form

&gt;   * Provide an educational resource to the local and global community.

&gt;   * Provide a location for students and those that seek knowledge to study and learn on their own time or after school or work.

&gt;   * Conduct efforts to locate, historical, cultural or educational value.

&gt;   * Create and present programs of educational value in an entertaining way both in person and through physical and digital media.

&gt;   * Assist local schools in education through the presentation of collection items in classrooms and through arranged field trips and presentations.


&gt;**The Plan**
Our organization will begin as a simple program to bring hands-on learning to local schools and to create video presentations for the internet. We will provide our services free to the schools and will gain funding with sales of DVDs of our educational productions

&gt;Once the collections and funds of the organization grow to a sufficient level

&gt;Our physical facilities will be examples of environmentally-friendly construction and practices and will be constructed to be as self-sufficient as possible through the use of solar power, earthquakes, fires, etc...).

&gt;Once the collection and funds have again reached a sufficient level

Please, and ask for them to meet with their constituents before they vote on cloture for this bill. Explain your opposition. Tell them why it will affect Oklahoma negatively.

Not to mention

Call them, and it will negatively affect Oklahoman business. Demand that they meet with their constituents before voting on this important bill, and demand that they vote against cloture for these bills.

Large things – such as fields, or things on the ground – are very difficult to get a usable picture of. 

For past portions of this project, building signs, monuments, skylines, etc. The idea is to find things that are either historic or easily identifiable. 

We're currently scheduled to drive through Hennessey

So

I teach in an inner-city extremely high poverty area in Oklahoma City.  My kids are absolutely amazing

My schedule this year is so difficult for kindergarten.  We have our breaks in the morning, but it's SO HARD when they're only 5 years old!!  I would love anything that you are willing to give to my kids (none of this is for me, I swear!!) but more than anything, I would love legos, tinker toys, lincoln logs, floor puzzles, and anything else that they could do at their seats to give them a little bit of a break in the afternoons.  Anything that doesn't require them to sit still

I also would love actual supplies, I was dreaming when I created it LOL!!

The other thing I can never get enough of is reward type things.  Simple things such as decorative pencils

----

[HB1354](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1354): Would allow bars/restaurants/etc to advertise happy hours between 4pm &amp; 7pm and allow them to sell alcohol at a discounted price.

[HB1741](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1741): This is a shell bill called the ""Oklahoma Intoxicating Liquors Reform Act"". I will update the description as soon as more info is posted.

[HB1757](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1757): Would require breweries to print the exact ABV on the label.

[HB1841](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1841): Same as HB1741 but called the ""Intoxicating Liquors Act"".

[HB1963](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB1963): A very expansive bill and I'm not 100% what the goal is. It appears to be removing references to ""low-point beer"" and allowing all beer to be classified the same.

[HB2104](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB2104): Same as HB1741 but called the ""Intoxicating Liquors Policy Act"".

[HJR1011](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1011) &amp; [HJR1014](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1014): Would allow breweries to sell their beer outside of the wholesalers network (I would assume this would allow brewpubs to serve their own high-point beer). Also would allow breweries to sell their own product at the brewery. This would be a ballot initiative.

[HJR1015](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1015): Would allow liquor stores to sell ""nonalcoholic beverages designed to be mixed with alcoholic beverages

[HJR1034](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1034): Would allow supermarkets and other grocery/retail stores to sell beer and wine between .5% and 25% ABV. This would be a ballot initiative.

[HJR1041](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HJR1041): Would allow wineries to directly ship their product to consumers over the age of 21. This would be a ballot initiative.

[SB861](http://newlsb.lsb.state.ok.us/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB861): Would allow bars/restaurants/etc to advertise happy hours between 3pm &amp; 7pm and allow them to sell alcohol at a discounted price.

Currently (and this has been on the books since at least 1986 i believe) it is not permissible to open a new liquor store or bar (bar meaning 50%+ of your sales is from spirits/wine/stong point beer) within 300 feet of an existing church or school.  School includes elementary, colleges and universities. 

That seems reasonable

Some people have heralded this as a major hindrance to the development of business in the Bricktown entertainment district.  This only refers to new establishments

There has been legislation set forth that has some interesting language in it.  In the proposed legislation

UCO does not want to cause problems for business in Bricktown, and didn't really have the language needed to convince lawmakers it was a good idea.  So this new form will be voted on probably near the beginning of next session in February or so.

I work with liquor law in OK and I am also a supporter of the responsible consumption of alcohol.

I think many people in the enforcement areas of Oklahoma liquor legislation would say that in order for Oklahoma's laws to change

Federal government seems so far away and bleak.  but you have a very real opportunity to affect your local lawmakers and government.   ",self,t5_2qtnt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/j866l/bricktown_liquor_laws_and_you/

Last night
Today, so I called the animal emergency hospital and told them his symptoms. As soon as they said ""parvo"" I freaked out and went down my list of people to call to ask for help, I had to call the last person I EVER ask to help with anything (my shitty, condescending cunt of an aunt) and she said to take him and she'd pay for the exam ($69) and to see how much the parvo test and stuff would be.

What ended up happening was she heard ""worms"" and thought well let's test for that first because it's treatable

The vet nurse basically said if I can come up with the $43~ before his shift ends around midnight CST that he will waive another exam cost.

He has said he is pretty sure it's parvo
Of course, and feeling like I'm basically sitting here trying to make him comfortable and seeing if he dies. 
He has a fever of 103.5, and he's somewhat lethargic. He's up under my chair asleep. The tech told me to keep him warm and freeze some Pedialyte into ice cubes, but I can't even afford fucking Pedialyte right now. 

I'm at my fucking wits end and all I want to do is cry.


If there is ANYWAY ANYONE can help me, and I always help everyone I can even if it ends up being detrimental to myself. I just always get the short end of the stick :(





**EDIT:** I had him put to sleep tonight. He wasn't keeping anything down and was shitting pure blood. He was listless and was starting to wheez.

I'm a 23 year old guy from northern Sweden who's moving to Oklahoma in August this year. The story goes like this:
I went to Iceland for 6 months earlier this year and there I met a girl from Tulsa who was studying in Iceland as an exchange student from OSU. We fell in love and after some thinking I decided to move to Oklahoma while she's finishing her studies at the university. I also decided to get my university studies going while living there (I've been accepted at Northern Oklahoma College).

Now what I'm asking you is: What can expect? I've been googling Oklahoma and to be honest there's mostly negative stuff about the state. I'm not too interested in this. I want to know what's great about Oklahoma! So could you guys and girls fill me in? Tell me everything there is to know about Oklahoma that could be interesting for someone like me :)

Reddit, that she has never met, in Claremore, OK and I'm getting TONS of red flags. But I cannot stop her from going. **Is there a kind soul that I can trust to perhaps go with her to meet this person?** – otherwise I need to buy a plane ticket pronto.

Background: Two of my cousins (aunt with niece) are visiting America from Bavaria, the other is her niece in her early 20's and has been very sheltered. They arrived in the East Coast, and are currently with family in Virginia. I live in California, and they're working their way West to visit us in ~2 weeks.

Issue: The younger of the two has a plane ticket to break away from her Aunt and visit a ""friend"" of hers in OK later this week. Alone. We all thought it was an exchange student or someone she knew. But no

Red Flags: The ""friend"" is on facebook, I was nervous. So I paid for a background check on her name. First off, her photo is from high school, but **she is in her 50s.** That was enough for our family to ask her not to go, but she assures us ""everything will be ok"". I'm not so sure...

I've been researching as much as I can, etc. Do I have a right to be scared? 

I also checked on her current husband, but my cousin is young &amp; naive and convinced her friend is just a nice person online. Maybe she is right... I know this is a shot in the dark, and I really hope this is all just me being paranoid... but I'd feel a million times safer if a nice soul in the Tulsa area could perhaps accompany her. Again, this is not a witch hunt, I am not going to give out any personal details of those involved, please PM me if you are someone that could help. Thank you Reddit.

I've seen this object in the sky 3 nights in a row and nobody reported back since. I also tonight have seen a 2nd object bright in the sky more like a south west position from 6AM to 6:15. This particular object could have been a satellite because it disappeared in the sky in a matter of minutes. 

I've also seen a some sort of weird extreme source of light flashing in the entire sky around Cashion around 6:15PM pm to 7:00 that wasn't a tv/radio transmission tower light or anything I could image around that could possibly be man-made. It looks like low-level storm lightning flashes from the ground-up to the sky but I cannot fathom what could output that kind of lumen intensity across then entire skyline unless some farmer or his kid are trolling somehow.

I was recently browsing NORML's website and noticed that the Tulsa chapter is significantly more active than the OKC chapter

""The OKC chapter has pretty much degraded to just ""me"". I have been involved since 1990. We used to have a working chapter but it absolutely didn't accomplish anything. It was basically the founder
We used to have a yearly 4/20 event at the Capitol. The next to the last 4/20 event we had over 400 people go to the Capitol grounds. The whole premise of the event that day was lobbying your state legislators. About 14 people actually went inside the Capitol. The interview on the news that day was of a pink haired person who was stoned or drunk ( a really great example!! NOT) of the people's message. The last 4/20 event at the Capitol it was a rainy day and not too many showed up. The bands couldn't even set up because of the moisture. We called the day early and went home. The kids who showed up stayed behind and chalked the Capitol grounds!! We were told that we were no longer welcome to have events there. But more importantly I had lost my will to try to direct these people. From there on out I just decided I would do what I can do myself and not try to get others to work on issues because it seemed fruitless. Nine years ago I had a major event happen in my life...my husband passed away. He was my support. I have since gone to work and haven't got as much time as I would like to be able to further the cause.
I still answer the phone calls and help people find a good attorney. I still help by going to court with people and holding their hands. We do have a Facebook account and this last session we had a Medical Marijuana bill. We were able to generate over 500 calls to Legislators. The bill did not get a hearing in committee but is still alive for next year.
2 years ago I worked with my county Democratic Party to get Medical Marijuana into the State Democratic platform. It is still there even though you don't hear candidates talk about it much.
 
I will retire soon (13 more months!) and will be able to start actively lobbying again. In the mean time if you would like to start a chapter in your area I would love to help you start it up. I have tried twice in the Norman area but it seems the only thing these people came to the meetings for was to hopefully smoke some pot. After letting people know that wasn't the point of holding meetings they don't come back.
 
If you have a plan and would like my support give me a call and we will get to work.""
