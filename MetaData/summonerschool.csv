1361315893.0,18ukl7,Platinum is easy! A few tips for all.,Cliffore,405,53,95,"Hey guys! About a year ago, and yes

Surprisingly, but I shot easily from Gold V to Gold II in just two weeks (around 50 games, subtracting my terrible tilting habits.) http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23846610#profile

What I realized was that it was not my mechanics that did this, I can easily get Platinum. I'd like to share with you all a few small things that has greatly helped me. Oh, and I didn't write this to give the basic tips like ""buy wards"" and such. You should all know this by now and research yourself if you truly want to get better.

**Pressure the map.**
This, I didn't do stupid stuff like chase or die randomly, but I could not win my games because I didn't pursue objectives that would eventually help us win the game.
Now, I personally believe the most important aspect of this are the towers.

I'm an AD carry main. Most of the time, farm my own jungle, come back to push my lane, and basically drag the game out. This is wrong. HEAD MID AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

Mid is an extremely important lane, especially top and bot, it is important to go to mid and push that tower down as soon as possible. Now, I don't mean leave your lane and wander mid to steal creeps or such, but when the time is appropriate, especially if you've won your lane.

Now

Don't forget that towers net global EXP and gold to everyone on your team. It's much like dragon

Secondly, and some people may just end up making mistakes and walking right up to your team for a free kill. Trust me, it happens a lot, especially in the jungle, where buff steals start happening.

Just pulling off such a thing around 20 to 25 minutes during the game (or even earlier)

**Recalling.**
I waste my time a lot. I randomly recall only to realize that I don't have enough gold to buy anything

I'm an AD carry main (once again), I'd rather stay in lane with no mana and farm safely so I can go back and buy that sword to dominate my opponent. The same applies for top and mid. Make sure you know what you want to buy (you can always open the shop by pressing P, I think. Or o. I do it too automatically) before actually recalling. It can save a lot of time.

Also

**Ganks.**
No, have too much money in the bank with no items to back up your damage, it's best to tell your jungler not to gank. Too many times have I engaged in some gank because my jungler came, and then realized I didn't have the damage or mana to successfully get a kill. It even backfired on me sometimes.

This will only end up wasting time, your opponent's items, and save mana for an ultimate if you know you will be needing it soon for a gank.
Too many times have I wanted to press that R on Graves to finish off an opponent with Collateral Blow, LOL!""

**Chasing.**
Don't do it. It's not worth it
It's hard at low elo

This is a common mistake at low elo, but most of the time, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Don't do it. It's better to let a kill go instead of getting killed yourself.

**Baron. Dragon.**
""OH, enemy comes in and aces.

Don't do Baron and Dragon if you know you don't have the damage. I've seen so many comebacks because one team, and then get Aced while the opponent team picks up free kills AND Baron.

It's better to heal and come back to do such objectives. This is one of the most common throws late game.
Oh, and then heal and Baron. Inhibitor allows you pressure the entire map at once, much better than taking Baron and then having the opponent team turtle as you waste your time with successful or unsuccessful dives.

**Don't get cocky.**
Too common at this elo, I've been called ""gold rookie"" or ""kid"". Also, ""I ain't losing to gold rookies."" Moments later, they end up throwing the game themselves. (I still remember this Diamond Xin Zhao attempting to 1v5 just because he was a bit fed. Well, that didn't go well...)

Don't get cocky. Just don't. Especially during laning phase. Just several games ago, and I got killed along with my support, feeding the enemy AD carry four kills in a row. There's no excuse. I got cocky, didn't watch the map, was sure I was winning, and ended up throwing the game.
It's a team game. Arrogance isn't going to get you anywhere

**Summoner Spells.**
Don't waste them.

Especially when you've been ignited and you still flash anyways knowing you're going to die.

Or when you flash into a tower for that last hit as an AD carry, you get exhausted and die.

They have long cool downs. Flash is standard 4 minute and 10 seconds. Ignite is 3 minutes. That's a long time. So that flash you just wasted earlier to escape an inevitable death could have granted you a kill or two.
If you know you're dead

I think that's all. For now. Yeah. Wow

**But

If you use this argument, no one wants to hear ""I just raped you so brutally!""  or ""You just got raped in the ass, haha!"" because it makes light of something traumatic that happens to people every single day.  This word is only used regularly  in the competitive esports sector of gaming, which also has a reputation of being one of the least inclusive, hateful, immature, and offensive communities in all of gaming.

**You should just suck it up and deal with it.  If you can't

No.  I'm not going to check myself out of living because the world contains racists and homophobes either.  Instead

**You must be a stupid teenager who has nothing better to do.**

Actually, development, art, design, and community/customer service.  I'm also currently the producer of 4 titles, was nominated for an award this year from Microsoft Women in Games, have been published in the Official XBox Magazine, and I'm incredibly passionate about the video game industry.  It's a fucking terrible place to work at times as a woman.  And I'm not shutting up until both the industry and the gaming communities that play these games stop and think about just how unwelcoming they are to women

Over the course of my career I have seen an absurd amount of situations that shouldn't have happened or could have gone better if something was played slightly different than how it was.  While trying to sleep I came up with this idea that everyone could participate in.

The idea is simple.  Every week or every few days I would post a random situation at different points in the game that people would most likely find themselves in at one point in their league career.  I would of course include item builds for every champion involved

The idea here is for everyone, silver, gold, diamond, etc. to give their own input and see how other players think when faced with certain decisions that may or may not change the tide of the game.  I really wanna help people in this sub but since I am not exactly in a position to coach someone there isn't much I can do and the best way that I feel I can help is by throwing something out that I have seen or is common enough that summoners can easily find themselves staring at while in game and getting everyone to give their own unique ideas to improve.

1371337341.0,1gf9z7,The best tip I can think of: MAN MODE.,bombeater,302,47,61,"I'm just a lowly Silver I player

**MAN MODE**.

MAN MODE is how you win games. It got me from Bronze V to Silver I. It's called MAN MODE, female, transgendered, genderqueer, genderless, or a duck! MAN MODE is a state of mind. MAN MODE is a way of life!

To understand MAN MODE (which must always be in all caps)

1. **Extraordinary success requires extraordinary risks**.

 Cowering under your tower or in the bushes as your team jockeys for positioning is like saying, Vi, Xin Zhao, Alistar, Leona, Thresh, and so on. **Take up space**. Assert yourself. As your team's front-line, position themselves

 You say you don't usually play support? Here's all you need to know: MAN MODE. Stand in front of your ADC. Give them some space to last-hit. Take a shot for them if necessary. Slam a ward into the river and watch that thing like a hawk. Nothing surprises you in MAN MODE.

 If you have trouble getting into the mindset

2. **The only unacceptable mistakes are the ones from which you learn nothing**.

 Tower-dive. Go 1v2. Go 1v3! **GO 1v5**! Be creative. Try wacky situational builds. Get flamed  by your team. Get reported. When you're behind, catch your cocky opponents out of position. The only rule is that you should strive to *never make the exact same mistake twice*. To do this, you need to carefully analyze every single mistake, every death, every loss, every time an enemy gets away with a smidgeon of health.

 Make mistakes, don't assume it's going to work out in your favor. That's not MAN MODE. That's just embarrassing. But MAKE GOOD MISTAKES. *If you're not making mistakes, it means you're not trying hard enough*.

Be prepared, or overcoming a psychological disorder like depression, you'll know what I'm talking about. When people see someone who has the audacity to go MAN MODE and punch mediocrity in the face, they get jealous, and then they get angry, and then they get *mean*. They will use every tool at their disposal to neutralize the threat of your increasingly undeniable progress. They will shame you. They will appeal to your doubts and your fears. You'll hear stuff like this:

&gt; *""You're not good enough to play that way yet.""*

**WRONG**! Playing creatively is how you learn your limits

&gt; *""It's unfair to your team when you take too many unnecessary risks.""*

**WRONG**! This might hold water in Ranked 5's, you all want to win (hopefully), but everyone wants something slightly different out of each game: some play to win, some play to improve, some play for fun, most play for a mixture of all three. MAN MODE is about playing to improve and learning how to do risk assessment on the fly.

Even further, but with morale and pentakills instead of cold sores. If your jungler tower-dives Irelia and gets outplayed, encourage them for making a ballsy play! ""That was a good try, Hecarim. I think the only mistake you made was underestimating the cooldown on her stun. **MAN MODE!!**""

&gt; *""It's arrogant to think you know better than everyone else. You're just an average schmo; you need to accept that certain ways of playing are the most effective and stick with those.""*

**[WROOOONNNNG](http://i.imgur.com/aZdxkXL.jpg)**!!! Having the confidence to take risks, and you will obey or discard them with increasing freedom as your understanding of the higher purpose matures.

[BUT PLEASE

Above all, this means you will mostly just hear a faint buzzing.

**HOWEVER**, even if they don't do anything with it right away. It doesn't matter if the advice is packaged in a gentle sugar-coated plea from a timid friend, or a vicious rant from your apoplectic 0/5/0 mid-laner who's AFKing ""*BECSUASE FK NOOB JUGNLER WANTS 2 COUTNER JUGNLE WITH NO VISIOBN!!!!1*"".

Remember: You are a skill-seeking cyborg badass sent from the future to destroy all foolishness, and ""You shouldn't counter-jungle with so few wards"" comes out the other. Then you assess the accuracy, adjust your approach if necessary, file it away, and move on.

That's all I got. When in doubt

**It doesn't matter whose nexus explodes**. Real victory is balling as hard as possible and going MAN MODE without regrets. Savor the bitter wine of being bested by a superior opponent even more than you bask in the glow of victory. Losing is *better* because it means you can still be even more awesome. If both teams go full-tilt and play their hearts out

(And ducks.)

1366040404.0,1ce74m,My elo hell Binge Continued (or the thought process of diamond players in ranked solo q),eloHellSunday,266,34,93,"**DISCLAIMER: I am not trying to promote leblanc

Yesterday morning some fellow added me with a simple request: ""spectate and teach me"". I obliged

I hopped on a bronze III smurf and started a 20 game 13 hour session

I'll start off by saying that bronze elo is insanely toxic. Champ select spammed, whining, blaming all game every game. **Dont let it get to you**

Why do I mention this? This is why I lost a game, unfortunately this was the last straw for cait who promptly announced afk. I shouldn't have let that previous game get to me, and I shouldn't have taken it out on cait whose only fault was a lack of matchup knowledge. We end up losing  a tight 4v5 which could've been won if our mid was better, but **would've** been won if it was 5v5.


Now I will go through each part of your average ranked game giving my thoughts and tips on how to abuse/correct the mistakes I identified in these bronze matches.

##**Pre-game**    
Please get some proper rune pages. [This is what I had to play with](http://imgur.com/AGOkIok) Replace ap with 4.5 crit dmg for the ad page. I cried a little when I saw them. This information is easily obtained on champion guides and other instructional league sites

*AP*: mpen marks, ap quints - it is so standard im always shocked to not see it on other people's accounts.

*AD*: ad marks, if you cant afford both go with flat mr), ad quints - the ad will help you last hit. 

You only need two runepages


##**Champ-select**

There's a lot to say about champ select, no matter how popular he is at the moment. You will see much better results by playing what you are comfortable with. And please don't flame your teammate just because he firstpicks Leblanc or counters himself, chances are he knows what he's doing.

If you are firstpick don't ban what everyone else is banning

By the time you see the loading screen

1. Your team is still in high spirits(this is harder than it sounds) 

2. Your team comp is balanced: magic and ad dmg

How do you achieve this? Make sure you know how to play 2 champs for every role. **You** need to fill the team's needs, just let it go, play jungle and babysit him. If tensions arise just try to soothe everyone ""calm down guys"", ""relax lets enjoy this win"", etc.

##**lvl 1 items**

What should you get? sustain sustain sustain sustain. It's sad but true that the best start for some champs is 9 or 11 health potions and a ward or two. I'm not going to go on about it but I saw a few dorans starts so I'm mentioning it anyway.

##**lvl 1 shenanigans**

1. Be ready when loading finishes. I know this isn't always possible

2. Invading/counter invading: Look at their team comp, adc in back and wait for the facecheck. Enjoy 2 or 3 kills every time(happened twice to us in the span of 20 games, with them raging from the start it's almost guaranteed win) If a skirmish breaks out **use your health potions asap and auto attack as much as possible**. Support placing a tactical ward is always helpful.

3. No invades happened - doesn't mean you should afk at your tower waiting for creeps

4. **get all the xp you can from jungle**(I had a wk start blue but refuse to do wolves

    1. *blue side*: bot should always try to get double golems(then help jungler if red start). mid and top should wolves if red start(jungler does wraiths alone

    2. *crappy side*: bot should try to stop double golems (then help jungler if blue start). mid and top should do wraiths(jungle does wolves alone or with ad help while support stops golems)

Congratulations


##**The early early laning phase**

Before you even enter lane, or strong enough to invade? maybe you should consider starting red with that amumu, or ask support for a ward there. You **should** have an answer to all of these questions. If you do not you simply need more league experience.

You now have a firm grasp(or not) of what's ahead of you, look at minimap, which lane arrived last? They most likely helped their jungler. This allows you determine which side of the lane is safest (mid) or how soon you are likely to be ganked (top/bot). 

The next step is to look at your opponent's items and stats (specifically mr/armor and ad/ap) before you get your first cs in order to identify any mistakes. No sustain? no mr mid vs a strong laner? no armor vs a high range champ or ad mid assassin? This right here is setting off plans in your head for early kills. These are big mistakes that should and must be abused right from the start. The earlier you build a lead

Regardless of the itemization/rune/mastery mistake the opponent has made,  AA first then use spell then back up so creep dmg doesnt screw you Or AA -&gt; ability -&gt; AA.
*Important note:* being the initiatior when harassing will push your lane. If you are a weak laner and/or their jungler is a strong ganker this is not desirable. Act accordingly.

This is where I give you the single biggest laning mistake I've identified on my way up the ladder. **Use your health pot as soon as you lose health**. Simple right? Wrong. Almost everyone waits to lose 200-300 health before using their first health pot that gives them 150 back over 15 seconds. that means they wont be full til 30seconds from now

So you have now traded damage, and will get lvl 2 wayyy before him. Check your xp bar after each cs and prepare the level up(i still mouse click, good on you if you can keyboard skillup), and combo(with flash if necessary) the enemy for the easiest fb ever. Shove lane into tower after kill then go buy some more damage and a ward. You have now completely crushed lane: tower will eat most of the first 2-3 waves of creeps and you have 2 levels on him. 

This works mid top and bot (support engages for bot). You should **always** be aware of this kind of scenario. If the enemy is pushing creeps faster than you, weak laners should always aim to avoid it.

All of this happens before the jungler clears his second buff (around 2:50-3:00). I went into extreme detail regarding this minute of play because it is largely overlooked

##**early laning phase**

For the remainder of the laning phase

**All of the laning phase should be a repeat of the first minute**. Nothing more nothing less: harass until the opponent makes a mistake, etc.) You are either a strong laner aiming for a kill, or a weak(preferably late game) laner just trying to farm as much as possible waiting for a gank. The difference being that the opposing jungler is now a threat to you and your jungler an asset for that kill.     
*Note:* Roles can be reversed if you get killed or your mid ganks a lane and gets some there. Know the state of your matchup at all times and keep an eye on the opponent's items.

Before level 6 I don't recommend ganking other lanes

Minutes fly by and you are approaching lvl 6. At this point of the game you should still have an xp lead(wether you killed your opponent or not) and the same thought process as lvl 1 should enter your head. As soon as you get that level up you are going to gain a huge dmg output and be in a favorable position to get a kill.

##**ganking phase (also applies to jungler all game)**

You've reached level 6 and hopefully you are in one of two scenarios:

1. You've killed your opponent one or more times and he is afraid it will happen again

2. You haven't killed him but have a skillset that allows you to easily push a lane.

If you have killed him 3 times or more, ulti) that can be used to kill another lane worth more gold and objectives. To carry you must get fed, but you must also ensure at least one other lane does as well.

So what do you do? before doing anything you acquire the information available to you: quick glance on minimap - is either lane pushed? if one (or both) of them are, dont be guilty of it as well) this is also a great opportunity to gank.

You've now identified a potential gank victim

[blue side gank routes](http://imgur.com/ZmaH4Gh)

[weak side gank routes](http://imgur.com/eeAfCKn)

1. green routes: these are your primary gank routes

2. blue routes: use these only if you know for certain that **only tribush is warded** (you can ask your team or you count support wards and notice they only placed 1 so far)

3. red routes: aka the lane gank. This is a great tool! use it. You should lane gank when a lane can be easily baited into attacking your apparently(or actually) weak teammates. If you notice many back and forth kills on a lane

4. the purple route: the sneaky route. Special mention for this favorite of mine when bot tribush is warded. After you've ganked bot once in the back they will start warding tribush. You will move bot again, we got ward. Enjoy an easy double kill. **Be careful** before passing golems bot, because creeps moving to lane will reveal you on minimap. To avoid this look top(at the pretty purple asterisk) and check that creeps are not going by your own golems, remember the map is mirrored ! As soon as the coast is clear, collect your gold bot.

5. the pink dot: for a pink ward to enable easy bot ganks + give you vision of their jungler's movements - remember to place it in bush at the angle so it sees both top bush and bottom bush.

If you have successfully ganked bot - **get dragon** thats +2k gold for your team for about a minute's worth of cs loss: worth it.

*Note*: When you start a gank route through the enemy jungle always keep an eye on the minimap. If you notice your lane and another lane closing in on you get out asap. 

*Second note*: If you have ganked bot already and you know the enemy warded the wraiths (but not the bush) AND you are confident in your ability to quickly kill your opponent

Much like the early laning phase

Good job playa

 * Btw, like a key mechanic, that I missed, anything you think or know you learned from one of the champions below, please help me and everyone else out by filling in that gap. Thanks ahead.

**Annie**

 * While playing as Annie

 * Playing as Annie teaches you to how to ""stack up"" charges with her passive, you have knowledge of how to do so already.

 * With this

 * Also, Disintegrate, also teaches you, indirectly, the importance of last hitting minions with it for the reward of the returned mana.

**Ashe**

 * While playing as Ashe

 * How to kite while AA, this helps with the practice.

 * A minor one

 * Her ult also teaches the player the importance of game-changing ults. (Although hard to aim and hit with

 * The importance of farming, cause she is what one would call a ""hyper-carry,"" meaning that although she may be weak early on, she will be devastating during late game.

**Garen**

 * When playing as Garen, E, R and critical hits, for being a bully in lane is a major ""do"" when playing Solo Top, as this lane is considered a ""snowball"" lane, meaning any advantage you have, is a big one. 

 * Also, who is able to dish out damage w/o sacrificing too much defensive capabilities.

 * While also learning how to be a lane bully, one can get a bit reckless with excessive poking or diving, and this can be forgiven thanks to his Passive heal. 

 * Also, e.g. you're pushing Top Lane and get ganked by 2 champions, 1 with a slow and 1 without. You save your Q, cause it removes slows, for when the 1 champion, let's say Olaf, lands his slow on you, and jog away unscathed.

**Katarina**

 * As you play Katarina, harassing, and reaction skills.

 * Positioning is learned when team fighting as Katarina, while the rest of her team is too far behind her to allow her to Shunpo to safety in case she gets ganked, she's got a high chance of getting caught. Positioning is important so that as she applies pressure with harass, w/o getting caught, and once she does go in for kills and gets the resets, she may want to reposition herself to prepare for another kill. 

 * Focusing is learned due to her burst as champion allowing her to ""all in"" on a squishy champion

 * Harassing is learned from her Q poke and W burst combo

 * Increasing reaction skills, or a mixture of both. 

**Master Yi**

 * Master Yi is a more difficult one to understand, for his kit is perfect for doing so and getting away.

 * His Alpha Strike let's you hit enemy's from a far once used properly securing kills under towers, he may go Meditate his health back in bush.
 
**Nasus**

 * Nasus teaches a player to learn the importance of farming

 * Since his Q scales on last-hitting

 * His W also teaches the player the importance of timing with skills

**Nunu**

 * Nunu, and sometimes even go AP Carry Mid.

 * What playing as Nunu teaches us is the importance of game-changing ults with is Absolute Zero

 * As jungle Nunu, CS, and forces him to go duo lane with someone to make up for the lack of EXP and gold, effectively hindering his/her presence in other lanes.

 * As support Nunu, and as well as buffing your ADC while being tanky and healthy thanks to your Q.

**Rammus**

 * Due to Rammus' kit

 * This taunt also teaches you how to ""lead"" the focus on a champion by taunting him/her

 * His Defensive Ball Curl teaches the player the importance and significance of resistances, versus just large amounts of HP-stacking.

 * Also, you can learn how to set up baits and lure enemies into a trap.

**Ryze**

 * Ryze, but Ryze is just a ""safer"" pick thanks to his Passive and the fact that he is fairly tanky for a ranged AP Mid

 * Ryze also helps the play understand the difference between bursting and constant DPS

 * When playing as Ryze

 * He also teaches you about how builds can be specific to some champions, etc. In which you learn what ""core items"" to build first, ONLY if you're doing well. 

**Sivir**

 * Sivir's kit teaches the player the mechanics on how to splitpush, Shen, Twisted Fate etc., you'll understand the fundamentals.

 * Due to her Q, thus adding to her ability to splitpush. 

 * Her kit allows her to splitpush effectively while also being extremely slippery, and Ult. 

 * You can also learn the mechanic of kiting thanks to the same abilities mentioned above, you poke the tower while poking him, weaving in and out of the tower's range, effectively kiting him thanks to you bonus MS from your Passive, Spell Shield right when he's about to use his Reckless Swing on you, and then bring the tower down and turn the focus on him, activating your ult, to quickly finish him off

**Sona** 

 * Another champion that teaches you the importance of game-changing ults, whether it be for an initiation, counter initiation, or as a 2nd initiation.

 * Her kit teaches you how to support appropriately with heals

 * As with Rammus, and then initiate with your Crescendo.

**Soraka**

 * While playing as Soraka, she is played as a passive support, meaning that she doesn't go out to ""set up"" kills, ALTHOUGH this does not mean she cannot zone for she can do that extremely effectively thanks to her silence from Infuse and her Starcall stacking.

 * Her kit allows her to be passive, and keep him/her buffed and healthy. 

 * This passive play style of hers teaches the player about the idea of ""Patience for High-Rewards

 * In team fights

 * Also, for you need to use her Wish appropriately and effectively through timing.

**Taric**

 * As Taric

 * You also learn the importance of Defensive Stats, i.e. your W and R.

 * Utilizing his passive, i.e. being OOM during a gank from your jungler and having both enemy ADC and Support get away since you were too OOM to CC one of them, in which the passive helps as a alternative to backing to base and missing out on exp, and opportunities to ""babysit"" for your ADC

**Tristana**

 * Tristana is another recommended champion that let's you understand the significance of Hyper-Carries, thanks to her Passive increase of AA range per level, Q steroid, W kill-secure + refresh, and ult repositioning. 

 * Tristana can teach a player about how keep control of enemy champions, similar to other champions of a bit higher difficulty like Lee Sin, Blitzcrank, Scarner, Thresh, etc. 

**Warwick**

 * Warwick, thus crippling the enemy jungler, which helps push your team ahead. 

 * His kit allows a player to sniff out an enemy who is way out of position and kill him/her

 * His ult, can be used to help the player learn how to initiate, and, as well as, whether or not to initiate, for his ult can place Warwick in a very vulnerable position. This key mechanic of the game sticks with a player when he begins to start playing other junglers that are fairly similar to Warwick, i.e. Jarvan IV, Maokai, yet can also put themselves in a bad spot as well

1372018067.0,1gxb5y,A whole ton of Nami ability tips.,TacticOgre,243,33,82,"Considered to be weak shortly after her release, poke, and since every tip helps

**Surging Tides (Passive)**

* Nami's passive grants a small burst of bonus movement speed to each ally you cast an ability on. This may sound a bit underwhelming, but it's also handy for moving around the map in general.

* When leaving your base, and the cooldowns will be back by the time you reach your destination.

* One thing to take note of is the fact that you can apply your passive to your teammates even with those spells that don't directly affect them. For instance

**Aqua Prison (Q)**

* Also known as her trademark bubble. An area of effect 1.5 second stun, Aqua Prison's cooldown is only 4 seconds shorter, and the stun duration stays the same. The area of effect is actually surprisingly large, you'll find yourself hitting two champions with it more than you'd expect.

* Famous for being tough to land, Lissandra and Jarvan IV are all fantastic examples. Conversely, it becomes a bit more difficult to use against very nimble champions, such as Vayne, Kassadin and Ezreal.

* Even though it may look like a knockup

* Don't hesitate to use it in lane when you see someone out of position. It's not just for disengages or all-ins.

* Q becomes significantly easier to land when the enemy is already stunned/snared/slowed. If the opportunity presents itself, and landing an easier bubble that way.

* Some of the easiest bubbles to land are when your target has no vision of you. Use the brush and tricks with line of sight as much as possible. 

* If you're trying to escape from a melee character who's already on your back

* When walking up to ward a brush, then no big deal, still better safe than sorry. Hitting someone in the fog of war also grants vision of them.

* Although it's a cheap ability to use to apply your passive onto someone

**Ebb and Flow (W)**

* A prime laning and teamfighting tool, it can affect up to three players: Either healing two and poking one, or poking two and healing one. Because of this, and the fact that the bounce range is fairly close to an average ADC's autoattack range, it's a godlike tool for 2v2 trades in lane.

* If you cast it on an ally, then it finds one more ally to bounce to. If you cast it on an enemy, the opposite is true. Which means that in the ideal situation: Cast on ally = Heal &gt; Poke &gt; Heal; Cast on enemy = Poke &gt; Heal &gt; Poke. Weigh both options, and decide whether at the moment you need more health, or more damage.

* In my experience

* Be smart about using your W

* Don't jeopardize yourself with the ability either

* Even though you want to be hitting as many people as possible with it at all times, don't be afraid to just heal your ADC under tower. Be very careful not to drain your mana pool this way, though - often all they need is a little health boost in order to safely hit creeps, and then they'll just lifesteal their life back that way.

* In more complex scenarios, and can do so if you use Ebb and Flow on your enemy, because everyone is in bounce range. However, casting it immediately on the enemy would be wasting a bounce that could have otherwise gone to you. Furthermore, there's no way to predict that the heal won't actually bounce to you instead of your teammate. In this case, one correct thing you could do is cast it on yourself. That way, it heals you, and from the enemy onto your ally.

**Tidecaller's Blessing (E)** 

* At rank one this ability is Nami's cheapest one (55 mana)

* Understanding the advantages your AD carry gains from Tidecaller's Blessing is an important part of knowing the best times to cast the ability. The on-hit slow, an ADC who has difficulty last hitting properly will have an easier time farming with the extra damage (it's also helpful for farming under the turret).

* Your E is also a decent chasing tool

* Even though your AD Carry is usually the best candidate to proc all three hits as fast as possible, because it gets refreshed with every hit instead of stacking. This doesn't mean that you should never cast your E on your ADC if your goal is to slow people down, but it's something to keep in mind.

* Another thing to remember is that the damage from the ability stays the same no matter who you cast it on. That means that although the ADC will usually apply the damage the fastest, the slow, and how fast you need to deal the damage. Many melee champions will appreciate the sticking power of the ability.

**Tidal Wave (R)**

* Although the duration of the slow increases from 2 up to 4 seconds depending on the distance the wave traveled, you gain an extra benefit.

* Because of this ability's ridiculously long range and the fact that it applies your passive to teammates

* Although the wave moves slowly

* Even though it's a good initiation ability

* Due to the slow nature of the spell, there's virtually no escape from Tidal Wave.

Apologies in advance to all readers


I am going to save you all some pain. A lot of pain. You already are a great player. There is no argument to this fact. Your mechanics, or you had different life experience or a different gaming background you might have reached this point with more or less skill. You can't change any of that. Your skills are a deterministic result of your past. You are here now. Welcome.


There are several common misconceptions and reoccurring mistakes I have noticed that are rampant within this community. I hope to enlighten anyone who will listen. For your benefit and everyone elses.


Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat


Yes I just quoted Sun Tzu. Yes I realise how lame that might appear. Get over it. This is LoL in it's essence


You will be making many mistakes throughout your journey. That's good. Make as many mistakes as possible and learn from them. The sooner you learn from them the faster you will improve. I will tell you right now. No matter what skill level you are at, it applies to most of the community you will be playing with and yourself right now. The meta will shift, people will evolve and discover new techniques and Riot will update the game.


Those of you who have already reached this conclusion by yourself


The fastest possible way to improve is as follows:


Find the biggest mistake you are making. 


What's the biggest mistake you are making you might ask? It's the mistake that is impacting your  odds of success the most that can be fixed with the least amount of effort


Your biggest mistake will constantly change for you as you evolve. Work on fixing that mistake until something else becomes your “biggest mistake”. 


As we have already established, they are in a better position than you are to determine your biggest mistake.


Have zero shame in seeking this advice out and admitting your faults. Staying within your own knowledge due to pride is a huge mistake that will hurt your progress as it will take you far longer to break plateaus and evolve. By finding people better than you, it's the best thing you can do.


The team that has by far the highest probability of winning a LoL match is the team that makes the least amount of mistakes. The problem is there are almost an infinite amount (for practical purposes) of mistakes that can occur in a game. Some of these include, timing, execution, positioning, psychology, team chemistry and on and on and on. 


The difference between a high skilled player and low skilled player is on average far less mistakes are made.  This brings me to my next point.


Almost the entire community doesn't understand the true concept of Elo hell. Here is the truth. Elo hell does exist. But you're wrong about where Elo hell occurs. 


True Elo hell is when you reach an Elo far below your skill and due to the number of games already played


The lower your Elo rating gets


More mistakes being made is great news for you. More mistakes simply equals more opportunity for you to leverage your higher skill set to win the game.


The inverse is true for higher Elo


The lower your Elo


One of the worst and most common mistakes that is absolutely plaguing the league at lower levels (and stopping players from progressing) are players that blame or abuse other people. Don't do it. 


Ever. 


Short of deliberately running into the other team's nexus


Learn how to handle things not going your way. Don't be a child. Don't poison your team. Realise you are responsible for how your entire team as a whole plays. You have the power to effect in game decisions and how things play out.


If someone is getting beaten down


Negative comments start a chain reaction of negativity throughout the whole team. If you are playing at a lower Elo players in your team can't handle these thoughts and function properly at the same time. Thanks for throwing the game. If you are lucky enough to win the game it's because your team won despite of you


Be aware of how your actions impact team chemistry and morale. Once you poison the team with a statement like this


This information should put you ahead of the curve to begin with. Good luck with your journey. It will be a fun one and there are plenty of good people here to help you at the summoner school.

I've noticed many players, as a jungler myself, I can tell you that camping a lane is not necessarily the most useful use of my time.  

The aim of this post is to emphasis on why you should be happy when your lane is camped. Ok

- You are not a stupid player who will feed over and over. You will play safely and wait for end-game. In the meanwhile, thus gaining an opportunity to win.  
- You are not a stupid player, and wait for the end-game.  
- You are not a stupid player. If one of your teammates had been camped, and your team would have lost the game. But their jungler chose you. You will be smart and patient. You will lose some CS, and you won't be able to carry that game. Yet, you will win, thanks to your teammates. And you know it, because - you knwo what - you are not a stupid player.  

So

1365704313.0,1c5era,Breakdown of LoL - For very new players,Rainbow_Warlord,222,34,36,"**Today I wrote a word document for my friends who wanted to get into playing LoL to explain it to them in a better way :P decided i'd post it here too

 
So let’s have a look at what League of Legends (LoL) is composed of. We have 3 lanes


In today’s modern Meta, these being:


* **Ranged Attack Damage Carry** – This is the person who will matter the most as the game goes on longer, and must get the last hit (or killing blow) on as many Creeps (Minions) as possible to generate enough income to buy items, they share a lane before AD Carries do not scale as well on levels as other champions do, such as AP Carries, so giving them a lane with another champion is not such a deficit. Example AD Carries are: Tristana, Caitlyn, and Varus


* **Support** – This is the person who will be guarding the AD Carry, this can be in the way of slowing, stunning, fearing etc. They will not be last hitting minions themselves, their main goal is to buy gold generation items (GP10s) that give the holder more gold than they would normally generate, they also will buy defensive team items, such as a sightstone, Lulu


* **Assassins and Mages** - These champions will be located in the Middle lane, meaning they need a way to quickly kill all the enemy creeps in their lane so that their minions will push into the enemy’s turret. The other need is the ability to roam around the map and generate pressure, pressure is defined as creating difficulties for the enemy team, be this in the form of ganking (entering a different lane to your own lane with the purpose of killing the opponents with an unfair advantage e.g. 3 versus 2) or stealing jungle camps, or pushing another lane. Example Mages would be: Karthus, Lux and Katarina. Example Assassins would be: Kha’zix, Zed


* **Jungler** – The Jungler for a team will not be going to a lane, although the laners must remember, it is not the Jungler's job to win their lanes for them. A Jungler should be able to duel well enough, so that if they meet the enemy Jungler they can defeat him or send him packing. This champion will usually be able to sustain themselves, meaning that they will not go low on health or mana so that they can gank lanes accordingly, they should also be able to pressure dragons and baron using their smite ability, which deals an amount of true damage, to a neutral minion or monster. Example Jungle Champions are: Nasus


* **The Bruiser or Tanky Mage** – This person will be sitting alone in the top lane of the map, or in simpler terms, to waste the Jungler’s time. This champion occasionally has to fight a 2 versus 1 lane, this usually happens when a team has an AD carry who only wants to farm for the late game, and not have to face the enemy AD carry, in this case the top laner must be able to survive and farm from a distance while not getting caught out and killed. Top laners can occasionally perform a tactic known as Split pushing, this is the act of pushing your laner hard and putting pressure on the enemy team to come and deal with you, this is generally used in the common Double AP strategy, and Yorick. Example Top laners that can split push are: Shen, and Rumble


So now you have all this information, and that is a Family.


* **Top, he will occasionally call for his father to come from to see him and give him whatever he needs or assist him, he does not often see the rest of the family until much later, where he is reunited with them.


* **Jungle, later he will secure objectives for his family to make sure that they can thrive effectively.


* **Mid, but cares too much for them, she will occasionally require help from her dad, and try to help out her mother and younger brother in the bottom lane, occasionally she gets into scrappy fights with the enemy in her lane, but later she will show her family what she can really do.


* **AD Carry, he still hangs around with his mum, while he tries to earn money and training to become like his older brother. Later after earning enough money, he will surpass his older brother and sister, and become the man he was mean to be, still easily slapped aside however; he will rely on his family to defend him so that he can reach his full potential.


* **Support, scaring away the enemies in her lane and making sure he has an easy time is her main objective, later she will try to keep her entire family safe, even if that means putting herself in danger for them.


So here is our Family

1362668985.0,19uim8,How to play in Mid Lane. (In-depth How-To) (Long Read),MarcAurelius,206,29,53,"Hey r/SummonerSchool! INA Aurelius here again with another guide for you all! Just trying to help out the general LoL community, champion familiarity, and to help the newbies out to the gaming scene. 

As you may remember me from my last guide, I'll be writing about How to play Mid Lane. 

 * If you haven't seen my last guide, here is the link below:

http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19e9tj/what_we_learn_from_recommended_champions/

To **clarify** on the point of this guide:

I'm writing it to help out anyone new to playing Mid Lane, and even people who main with a champion in Mid Lane and just wishes to get better at it. I hope you all enjoy this guide, as much as I do writing it, so I may, to the best of my knowledge, to explain what and what not to-do when playing Mid Lane.

**Mid Lane - The Basic Fundamentals**

 * **Your Role in the Team Composition** - Depending on whether you're playing as an AD mid laner or, your essential role 
in a 5v5 team composition is to be a primary source of whatever DMG you scale off of

 * **What Champions can be played in Mid Lane**

When you ask what champions can be played in mid lane, there are some champions that just don't belong in Mid Lane, e.g. Leona or Rammus mid?, so one might ask, what champions do? Since there are A LOT of champions, I'll do and explain a general breakdown of the **types** of champions, to the best of my knowledge, if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one

 * *""All-In"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, Riven, Kayle, etc. This type of champion is very ""bursty"" in his/her combos, and generally have a kit aimed to allow him/her to make successful dives for you, when you're under your tower w/o much threat from tower-aggro, and get out unscathed thanks to either his/her resistances, or good escapes.  

 * *The ""Nukers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Malzahar, LeBlanc, Syndra, etc. This type of champion has some close similarities to the ""All-In"" Mid Laners in DMG output, but lack the kit to make ""safe"" tower dives. They generally rely on simply out-bursting you with his/her kit, much too fast for you to even respond to it. Although they generally have insane DMG output, due to their lack of resistances

 * *The ""Teamfighters""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Orianna, Zyra, etc. This type of champion is categorized for his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although they may not be the best candidate for upfront 1v1s, they excel in 
their roles as an AP/AD Carry in teamfights thanks to his/her kit. They are also known for their zoning capabilities during laning phase

 * *The ""Duelist""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Diana, Kayle, Zed, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her DPS potential and the general idea that he/she can take some punishment for a kill, i.e. tower diving, very aggressive zoning

 * *The ""Roamers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Evelynn, Katarina, Nidalee, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to push his/her lane extremely quickly and then leave to go gank other lanes. They are best known for their highly successful ganking potential, e.g Twisted Fate's Destiny&gt;Gold Card or Katarina's Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;R, that can help that particular lane ""snowball"" ahead the enemy laner. 

 * *The ""Secondary AD Carry""* - Some champions that fall into this category, you may still stumble upon this type of Mid Laner. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to ""bully"" the enemy laner with just AAs thanks to his/her range. 

 * *The ""Play for Late"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, Anivia, Mordekaiser, Cassiopeia, etc. This type of champion is categorized by the simply idea that they do not need kills to be successful, although not-dying is important as well, relying on just ""farming for late game"" holds true in this type of champion's strategy. They are generally item dependent on their DMG

Those are the main categories,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**How does the Mid Lane laning phase differ from that of other lanes?**

The differences between Mid lane versus Top and/or Bot lane

 * The distance of the enemy and allied towers from one another

 * The distance of the towers behind the 1st tower, since the tower ranges overlap one another. 

 * Bushes are placed on either side of you making ""bush-ganks"" less common for you if you play safely away from them. 

 * You have access to both sides of both jungles, etc., which means that a little responsibility is put upon you when it comes to the jungle since you have access to either. 

 * You have access to both entrances to the river

 * You are a Solo lane, and more CS. 

 * Your lane may be ganked more often than other lanes

 * You have the responsibility, of keeping and eye out for the following areas: Mid Lane mias, Purple and Blue side ramps to Wraiths, Side bushes, and (sometimes) enemy blue buff spawn times. 

**Ganking as a Mid Laner**

Ganking as a Mid Laner is sometimes risky, but may potentially snowball an enemy lane, so knowing when to gank as a Mid Laner is key. At least one of these criteria must be met (although not always) if you wish to go gank another lane: 
 
 * If you have pushed your lane to the enemy tower

 * If you've ""forced"" your enemy laner out of lane and back to Base. 

 * If you've been ganked by the enemy jungler and enemy mid laner and kill either one of them

 * If one of your teammates is forced to tower-hug AND the enemy laner of your teammate has no ward coverage as they overextend. 

 * If you have a large lead against the enemy mid laner and cannot be hurt much if you leave lane and miss CS and gold. 

 * Your enemy mid laner is missing or if you killed them and are ""healthy"" enough for a successful gank.  

*How-To Gank (tips)*

 * Ping that you are on your way

 * Ask if any brush/river is warded. 

 * Wait for the perfect opportunity is which you can guarantee a kill

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/Flash/etc. for when the enemy uses his/her's. Most cases, or ""bad"" allied plays. 

 * Sometimes, how much HP the enemy laner has, the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, the location of the enemy jungler and mid laner. Remember, think before you do. ""Bad"" plays are generally made through poor decisions, which come from not thinking before he/she acts.

**The Importance of the Mid Lane tower**

 * The Mid lane towers are the most important among the ""Lane Towers

 * So having these down will definitely give you an advantage for if your creep wave is pushing into their base, allowing you to get objectives, e.g Dragon, Baron, Buffs, other towers, etc.

 * ALTHOUGH, i.e.  you need to save the tower so that you can receive creeps to farm off of, cause if the enemy mid lane tower is gone, you might have to overextend to get any CS or gold, putting you in a very vulnerable position. Communicate with your teammates to ensure nobody is ""missing out"" before the first tower falls. 

**What should I start with when I go Mid Lane?**

 Your choices are:

 * *Boots &amp; 3x Pots* - This is a recommended start for anyone who is up against any enemy champion that relies of skillshots for his/her DMG output. And the 3x HP Pots are a grace given to you for some sustain if you do happen to get hit by a skillshot. This start may be skipped if your Rune Page has 3x Quintessences of MS, that extra MS might help you catch someone out of position, catch someone when invading during early game, dodge more skillshots, or outrun your opponent if you get caught. 

 * *9x HP Pots &amp; 2 Green Sight Wards* - This is a start that is taken when you are aiming to simply out sustain your opponent, and levels. This is generally taken with champions that benefit from not having a mana Resource for his/her abilities, e.g. Katarina, Riven, Akali, etc., this n=does not have to limit the champions that do use mana for you can just simply trade in 4x HP Pots for 4x Mana Pots instead. Again

 * *Cloth Armor &amp; 5x HP Pots* - Although this is more commonly taken for Top Lanes or was taken for junglers back in Season 2, and if you don't feel confident playing against this particular champion.

 * *4x HP Pots &amp; 1x Fortitude Pot* - This is taken for only two reasons: One. You are planning to be excessively aggressive and are playing an AD champion, deny the enemy laner from farm, while healing up on any trade backs, if any. 

 * *Doran's Ring or Doran's Blade* - These starting item allows you to stay in lane for a very long time, harassing to deny CS from the enemy laner, staying behind your creep to avoid getting hit by skill shots, etc. An ok  item to start with, if you only wish to farm and be passive, but does not offer the same bonuses as other starting items and vice-verse.

 * *Tome &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot or Sword &amp; 2x HP Pots* - A poor choice

 * *Crystalline Flask &amp; 3x HP Pots/Crystalline Flash &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 1x Pot* - This is generally taken for heavy sustain early on, Gold, and levels.

 * *Fairy Charm &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 6x HP/Mana Pots* - Another option for mana users who know that they will rely on his/her mana-cost abilities to farm

1376049250.0,1k0qzr,"An in-depth guide for players about to start ranked, and low ELO players!",Btf117,194,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1k0qzr/an_indepth_guide_for_players_about_to_start/

Hey guys! This is my second guide I've posted here, and I'm currently Silver II [My Kassad.in page] (http://quickfind.kassad.in/profile/na/beyondthefray117/). I've climbed up from Bronze III in 180 games, and hopefully I'll climb into Gold by the end of the summer. I main support (crazy, right?), and I've picked up a few things about lower ELOs. These can apply to all ranked games but definitely more applicable to lower ELO levels.

But before we start, losing is more frustrating and more upsetting than normals.

Other perks:

* Summoner Icons
* Colored Banners/Loading Screen Borders
* Victorious Skin (That's why I want to get to gold)
* Bragging Rights with friends
* Get better at the game

**Vocab List**
if you're really new

* CC - Crowd control. Slows, etc.
* ELO - Your rating. It is not an acronym
* Gank - ambush
* Flame - rage at something/someone
* CS - Creep score. The number of minions you as an individual kill.
* DoT - Damage over Time. Spells like Ignite
* AA - Auto Attacks. Basic attacks that are done with right clicks.  

And without further ado
***
Teamwork - People in low ELOs flame. Hard. If you flame

[This] (http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2EB9D1C236F6274) is what I listen to when I stream or play ranked games. It helps me relax and just have fun. This is Badministrator

Still

A few days ago I played with an excellent Ezreal. He was 10/1 at 20 minutes and was just playing well. I was support Nami. At one point I tried to zone the opponents by being aggressive to get Ez some free farm. They called my bluff and I died. Instead of getting mad at me, ""my bad, sorry."" Although Ez was being flamed by out Zyra about how blue Ez is terrible now, he didn't yell at me, and it made me just upset at myself, not him, and so I changed up my gameplay and didn't die for the rest of the game.

Another part of teamwork is communication. Marking timestamps on Dragon, lane brush that blocks lane ganks), blue, and red buffs are very important. As a jungler, you should be paying attention to where they ward and noting when the laners tell you where and ping. This also includes letting your team know who is picking up the Aegis/Locket or other aura items.

PROTIP: Turn on ""Show Timestamps"" in the More Options to easily stamp dragons and barons

Not just timestamps, not you. If you have an Orianna, she should use E (shield) on Malph first and ult after he ults. I know this sounds very specific, but over time (if you're new) you'll figure out which characters should do the engage, and it's usually ""catch-you-by-surprise"" gap closer. Leona, Malph, Amumu, Ori, not your Vayne or Caitlyn. This sounds crazily obvious, and it's just crazy how many times I see the mid going in way past their front line to poke at their full team
***
Last Hitting - Yep, and I'm wondering how that's even possible. It's simple, really - they're focusing on poking down their opponents rather than picking up CS, and this is a great way to beat your opponents - gold. Just don't die to their poke and outfarm (basically attack back to get them off of you when they go for you, but don't play too aggressive yourself). Then, on your first back, you can outbuy the other ADC and go for an all-in on them. If you play it correctly, jungle might gank, show your presence further. Poke safely and focus on CS. **You will win lanes by CSing. Killing helps

(This is a bot lane scenario. This works for top and mid too) If you are ADC, always shove your lane. Push and CS. This accomplishes two things - (1) as your enemy ADC runs to lane, you will have more gold to spend when you back giving you the advantage, and (2) the enemy tower will kill the minions and not the ADC, denying XP and farm.

Here's a game I read on this sub that I stole as a great way to improve last hitting - Play ADC, or anyone really that will agree). This partner plays support. The ADC must get:

* Easy - 100 CS in 15 minutes
* Difficult - 85 CS in 10 minutes

The support cannot go past his farthest minion. The support has to stop his CSing as best they can OR kill the ADC. The ADC must reach the listed CS numbers above.

This not only teaches CSing, just to a lesser extent.

** If you are 5/0 with 0 CS you will lose to someone 0/0 with 100 CS. Yes
***
Runes - DO NOT start ranked without runes. If you have two pages only, frankly, whatever position you play most. But you should have one for AP and one for AD.

On the rune page, Glyphs are Blue, Quints are the large thingies.

* ADC - 9x Flat AD Marks, or if you're cheap because flat MR is for your Mid page too), and 2x Lifesteal Quints and 1x Flat AD Quints. You can also run 3x LS Quints if you want, too.
* Mid - 9x Hybrid Pen Marks (these are expensive as hell, 9x Flat MR Glyphs, and 3x Flat AP Quints OR 3x Movespeed Quints

If you roam a lot as mid

* Support - 9x Flat Armor Marks, 1x Flat Health and 2x Gold per 10.

This page gives armor to counter their ADC in lane, when paired with a Philo stone and the proper masteries, that's 10 gold per 10. That's a lot of bonus income to spend on wards.

ALTERNATE OPTION: Take 9x Flat Armor Seals instead of having only 5x. And take 3x GP/10 Quints. Same amount of GP/10

* Jungle/AD Mid - Take your same ADC page and give it Movespeed Quints. AD assassins could also benefit from the ADC page.

***
Roles - You should never be the one saying ""top or feed"". You should know every role well enough to play it ranked or regular, this means learning and playing support. Rule of thumb is to have a few characters in each lane that you're comfortable with, and usually ones that have different strengths/weaknesses so you can't be counterpicked.

For example

* Top - Cho, Riven, Jayce, Zed, Shen
* Jungle - Cho, Vi, Zac
* Mid - Veigar, Zed, Heimerdinger, Xerath, Nidalee, Annie
* Support - Everyone. Hehe. But I play mostly Zyra, Leona, Nami, and Sona.
* ADC - Cait, Miss Fortune, and 100% never Draven (even before he was Olafed)

Those are the characters I feel comfortable playing in ranked games. You should have at least two

*Let's take a break to defend my ""shots fired"" comment about Nid support. If Nid builds classic support, a Philo, and Wards, her heals do nothing and her spears do no damage. If Nid builds AP her spears do some more damage but still not a significant amount because Nid won't be getting CS. Also Nid sacrifices basically any ward coverage and this means free barons, dragons, and ganks for the opposing team. Now, back on topic.*

It is NOT wrong to have one or two preferred roles at all

**Pick characters you are good with
***
Champion Select - Pay attention! Draft Pick is very different than blind pick. 3 bans and alternating picks.

Bans - Common bans are as follows in low ELOs:

* Bronze - Malphite, Shen, Thresh
* Silver - Amumu, Nunu, Vayne, Twisted Fate, Elise, and occasionally Zac.
* At high ELOs, Nunu, and Twisted Fate are the most commonly banned.

Let's say you're ADC and 4th pick. The enemy ADC picks Ashe. Going to ChampionSelect says that Ezreal is strongest against Ashe. You should not instalock Ez for the sole reason he beats Ashe. Play Ez only if you are very confident of your ability on him. 

An example of falling into the trap of this was my brother the other day. He's a Bronze II ADC/Mid player and faced a Morgana. He played Talon

Another note: [Look at ChampSelect's view on Ashe] (http://www.championselect.net/champ/Ashe). What do you see? It says that Cait is both strong and weak against Ashe

*So can I ever use this website for counters?* Yes, using it to choose who NOT to pick rather than who to pick. This means if they lock Graves and you're ADC, don't pick Ezreal. I say this for two reasons: (1) If he picks graves before your ADC is picked, he probably feels most comfortable on Graves. Putting yourself on Ez puts yourself at a disadvantage. Of course, any lane can be won by simply good play (in low ELOs especially).

Ez is sort of a poor example because he doesn't really have any super hard counters thanks to his Arcane Shift
***
Summoner Spells - Why is this a topic? Because I see a lot of low bronze players taking summoners that put them at a disadvantage. Usage is also very important. But first

*Spells are in order of importance. Please note that some champions (champions with no ranged abilities) work better with Ghost than Flash, Nocturne, and Nasus.*

* Top - Flash &gt; Teleport &gt; Exhaust &gt; Ignite &gt; Ghost. Top lane is isolated from all other lanes, and keep global pressure. A lot of people can't deal with split pushers in low ELOs so taking teleport and creating pressure elsewhere can draw a lot of people on the enemy team, opening up the chance for your team to take other objectives while the opposing team is in limbo. Flash is pretty self explanitory. Exhaust will win you a duel if your damage output is sufficient. Usually is used best to force flashes.
* Mid - Flash &gt; Ignite &gt; Teleport=Barrier. Ignite is to add to your high damage output, but don't do much after their burst is over. Flash is practically mandatory here.
* Jungle - Smite &gt; Flash/Ghost &gt; Ignite. The reason Flash and Ghost didn't get the equals sign here is because they shouldn't be of equal importance, but it's doable, just not the best.
* ADC/Marksman - Flash &gt; Barrier &gt; Cleanse &gt; Ignite. Barrier is better than Ignite nowadays because it really wins duels for you. You're 15 health under your tower and the enemy ADC is 250 health. He dives your tower
* Support - Flash &gt; Exhaust. No options for you in support, and that will really help tip the scales in your favor. Flash because otherwise escaping will be near impossible, as most likely you'll be underleveled and squishy.

**Usage of Summoners** - more advanced part. As I spectate my Bronze IV friend

* Flash - you probably should be taking this every game so I'll go for it first. Flash is a defensive spell, wasting the spell, XP, and farm over the other ADC that used barrier under their tower. Tip 1: Use flash offensively only when absolutely necessary (such as your team is engaging a fight at dragon and flashing in is the only way you can get damage down). Another rule of thumb for offensive flashes is only use it when you both know you can secure the kill this way AND you cannot get it otherwise. In defensive situations, flash away from CC abilities that ensure your death (Zac Slingshot, J4 EQ combo, Nami bubble) or flash over walls. This counters those who take ghost. Another point about defensive flashes though - you don't have to use it every time it's up. If you are playing Cait or Ezreal, respectively) before using flash. I see a ton of people in low Bronze flashing away from a jungle gank when they have full health. It's not always necessary to flash.
* Teleport - I very rarely get to play toplane, getting back to lane, and ganking. To start with ganking, I instruct the friendly support to pink ward the lane brush closest to the enemy tower, in the middle or more towards their tower. Then after the ward is cleared and they are being pushed back, I teleport in and surprise them from behind. This works even better with your jungle ganking as well, but it's not necessary. Ping to engage and rush in, as the enemies are very likely to burn flash and if you get into melee range then they have a chance to escape. You can also use teleport to counter split pushers. If everyone's mid except for one enemy almost at the top tower, especially if your team is tunnel visioning (when they are so focused in their lane that they just ignore other spots on the map.
* Ignite - this is a spell I see misused all the time im Bronze V-III. Ignite does two things: reduces healing by 50% and applies true damage over time based on current level. So how do we use it? At Bronze V-III I see something all the time that I refer to as ""Ignite harass"". This is a term I coined in S1 (where I called ""poke"" ""harass"" still) when someone uses Ignite for no reason, Aatrox, and Nidalee that have healing abilities, and in this case Ignite should be used to power through these abilities and guarantee your victory in the duel/fight.
* Barrier - Most likely you're playing ADC if you're taking this spell, Barrier is a spell for winning duels. Most of the time in duels ADCs are hitting at each other, both supports have used exhaust, and the supports are closer to the enemy ADC over their own because they're trying to get all the CC and damage they can onto their target. Barrier will give enough of a shield to hopefully take the lead in the trade and secure you a kill. Use it in duels, use it when you're getting dived under the tower, use it when you would otherwise die. Just don't use it too early because it doesn't last that long (for things like Cait's ult or Karth's ult).
* Smite - This is a spell that I seem to have a ton of trouble using correctly myself. I usually spam it in the jungle, blue buff on purple side. Make sure this is a smiteless leash. Then go to your other buff next, use smite and clear it yourself. This sets you up to gank top early. You should have a level on the laners and it's likely they do not have wards yet. If you and the top laner are on the same page, that can be a quick first kill. Then you can clear your smaller creeps, gank mid, or back. Or all three. Back to smite. There's times where using smite is perfectly fine in lane or in the jungle, but if you plan on ganking bot at levels 6-10, but rather wait to see if you can be successful in your gank bot, keeping smite for steals is pretty important too. With proper warding by you and/or your support
* Exhaust - This is always taken as a support, and duel. In ADC targeted, this is when your ADC is running away, usually back to the tower, and there's little damage being put onto you. If your ADC has a good amount of distance to still cover, or is somewhat low, this is a time to use exhaust. The slow will weaken their chase and the damage the ADC will put out is also dampened. This should allow your ADC to escape. Note that this is a decision that can be difficult to make, you should note a few things before immediately popping exhaust, etc. It's also important to NOT use exhaust when your ADC is below 5-10% health, and makes it easier to hit skillshots

Yes

Trading - Trading is a pretty advanced topic

[Here is a great lesson on ADC mechanics and trading that should have been sidebarred a while ago] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE)

[Mobile friendly version] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE)

Trading is fighting your opponent

The ""Trading stance"" (explained in great detail in the video) is where you wait for the enemy to go up for a CS, or (2) make them afraid of CSing in your presence. Both are very optimal. Big warning though - *do not sacrifice your own CS to do this.* If you do not CS yourself and spend all your time poking, especially without kills, then you starve yourself without really knowing it. You may *feel* like you're winning lane, but in reality you may have the same amount of gold that your opponent does.

Another important part of trading is capitalizing on enemy mistakes. In a normal game I played yesterday, but made his big mistake when he tried to outtrade me. No minions of mine were really low, so he hits his Q and jumps in. I retreat to my minion wave, and when he jumps in, I fight him. I know I have the advantage with my minions all targeting him, and he didn't put out too much damage. I use Q, W, just by winning a trade that forced him to play defensive for the rest of the laning phase

Basically the point my story above is saying that at low levels
***
Warding - Yeah, pushing towers, or engaging fights.

**Every role should have wards**, dragon) when the support is not in lane. As support, you should be warding a lot more than that. In the Bronze IV games I watch I play a game called ""ward off"", where I count which team has more wards than the other every 5 or so minutes. The most wards I have ever seen is 4 to 1 in favor of the purple team. Usually it is 1 to 0 or 1 to 1, with 0 wards on dragon or baron. Supports - if you have a Sightstone, USE IT! It's free. This drives me crazy to see no ward coverage and watch carries get caught out really badly. 

Wards also will let your team know when the enemies take dragon or baron

So where do we ward? Most of the time, it can be a good idea to ward at enemy buff camps (blue mostly, but red works too if an ambush is set up accordingly). Remember the blue buffs will spawn at 1:55, ~7:15, ~12:30-13:00, and so on. Red and Blue buffs are on 5 minute spawn timers. All regular camps are 50 seconds. Dragon is 6 minutes, Baron is 7. This means a good time to ward the blue buff is around 5:00-5:30. This way, if your team is in position

***
Ranked Game Fears - You should never be afraid to play a ranked game. If it's scary, I think ranked games can be more fun than normals because most of the time everyone wants to win. Goals are centered on playing good champions and winning games over trying out new strategies or learning new champions, and for me, I feel like when everyone's trying I can pinpoint what went wrong with the game and improve much more from my losses. 

If you are really afraid of ranked games, 3v3s (2-2 in our ranked promotion to Silver and we get placed vs. a Diamond 1 Blitz. We got destroyed), or Hide and Seek.  It's just the way the game goes. But I think every level 30 player should at least try playing ranked, or at least normal draft mode to get the same feel in a no-risk scenario (con is longer queue times in normal draft)
***
If you want to see me play a ranked game as support, I'm trying to clean it up but some content is really bad, or just nothingness. I'm new to streaming so I apologize for this.

Thank you so much for everyone that took the time to read this wall of text, I just want my efforts to not go in Vayne (ba dum tiss). But seriously. This took a long time.

If you didn't like it

**TL;DR: Ranked shouldn't be scary, and don't be overly aggressive. Last hit (when applicable), do damage, and win games. Good luck summoners.**

1371505600.0,1gjkt5,Just had adc coaching with a Diamond I. Here is what I learned.,exeneva,171,14,48,"Here's his lolking: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/eune/21795091#profile

We focused on a few matchups specifically. I'll post what he mentioned here.

**FOR ALL ADCs:**

* Shove lane if possible, making it harder for them to last hit. Ganks become near-impossible if you are able to freeze the wave correctly, because there will be your massive minion wave between you and them (and their tower), so a jungler coming from the side can be intercepted easily.
* A good farmer is better than someone who gets kills every now and then. Gold-per-minute should be maximized
* Taking the enemy's bot tower before 10 minutes is often not a good idea. The enemy adc essentially gets free farm and can catch up if behind. Get dragon (if it's safe) if you kill them or make them recall at bot.
* If you are losing lane


Matchup-specifics:

**VAYNE vs. CAITLYN**

* Caitlyn will push the lane
* Caitlyn doesn't have the best all-in capability
* Caitlyn needs to rush BortK against Vayne, I was 4/2 Caitlyn against Morrigan's 2/4 Vayne, but he had BortK and was able to dive me and secure the kill even when behind. This is because there is no way to escape from Vayne if she uses BortK active and steals your movement speed (combined with her passive and damage bonus from her ult). If you rush BortK against Vayne, you can steal her movement speed and escape until her ult goes on cd.
* Vayne only needs BortK and Last Whisper to do insane damage. Even if Vayne is 0/4 in lane

**EZREAL vs WHOEVER**

* Blue Ezreal is a very cost-effective build, due to Q.

* If you are against an aggressive adc like Cait or Draven

* You should never die as ezreal in lane because you have E to escape. Focus on farming that cost-effective blue build while also not dying.

1349668332.0,114dfs,Just stop it. Stop blaming other people.,Cliffore,190,35,66,"Stop blaming other people for YOUR mistakes.

Look, you'll eventually get there, leavers, feeders, ragers, or whatever.

What NOT to do to get there is to blame others. YOU take responsibility for that death that gave them dragon and snowballed the game. YOU take responsibility for baiting your team into an ace. YOU take responsibility for the calls and the decisions you make in lane

Tl;Dr: STOP BLAMING OTHERS FOR THE RESULT OF YOUR GAMES.

1374765831.0,1j15jm,My best tip for winning more games over time.,MAGllKARP,176,22,60,"For every role and match up

- You might not be able to win the lane but you never have to feed.

We've all seen that Lee Sin who types ""/ALL #INSEC MECHANICS!"" and then proceeds to give the enemy Darius double buffs trying to solo him at level 3. We've all had that mid lane Zed who insists that he counters Kassadin and then proceeds to die to him... again... and again... and again... 

So you picked Shen and the other top laner picked Kennen? GG? No. Start Doran's Shield, stay at your tower, and gtfo if he runs at you after hitting level 6. You might die once or twice and you might lose your tower too. Once it goes down you can freeze it at your second tower to catch up in CS. You can still become that late game tank and you avoided feeding a Kennen, whose ult could destroy your entire team mid game (if you fed him). 

So again

- You might not be able to win the lane but you never have to feed.

You might have to give up a lot of CS early on. You won't get to make plays early. You will probably lose your tower. But you can stay relevant and allow for the possibility of your team mates to do well.

Here's a thought: to improve at League, and lose slowly"". Or: ""when you have no advantage, play like you have one; when you have an advantage, play like you do not"". In a moment, I'll explain it in detail, but for now, keep in mind that the first part should be interpreted like so: ""when you have no advantage

I've noticed a huge improvement in my win rate, since I started to take this approach. When I start the game ahead, I almost always win, and when I have a bad game, I NEVER feed as badly as I used to, and make way more comebacks.

To elaborate:

When you're ahead

When you're ahead

Instead, you forced them out of lane and get to take a tower. No need to dive. Just hit the tower and you might get a kill anyway if they decide to stay and defend it.

If you play carefully and methodically while ahead

Conversely, ""It doesn't really matter what I do now, this game is over"". You might not be thinking it consciously, but it affects your play anyway. You give up first blood and think, ""I haven't lost lane yet. I can still outplay them."" Then you give up another kill, and another, and another, kill champ.

When you're behind

Instead, you know you're at a disadvantage, so there's NO REASON TO GO ALL-IN unless your jungler is ganking and you know that their jungler isn't hanging around for a counter-gank. So you just farm creep, harass when possible, place wards, and wait for your opponent to make a mistake.

**II. Quick Intro from the Author.**
 
Hi guys! Xedeth here. I am a Silver II ADC main. I have been maining ADC since, and have loved playing it ever since. This guide will detail everything I know ABOUT everything I know. I listed a nice index, so you can use CTRL+F to search for the section you want to know about specifically, or you can look at the bottom for the summary, also known as the tl;dr! Shall we begin?
 
**III. What are you? Defining the role.**
 
You are an ADC, also known as CS'ing, to gain gold for expensive items you have to buy. You are innately squishy, and in combination with the large amount of damage you do, you will almost always be focused in ganks and teamfights. This segway's into our next section...
 
**IV. What aren't you? Defining what you cannot or are not supposed to do.**
 
You are not the front line. You are not the tank. You are not the initiator. You are not the support, and even fewer that it works for.) You are not the buff control'er. You are not the diver, chef, nurse, nothing.
 
You are not to stop CSing unless you are teamfighting. If you aren't teamfighting
 
**V. Why are you important?**
 
You provide the core damage of your team in almost every team composition. That's pretty much it. Without you, the stronger you are, and therefore more useful to your team. An ADC that falls behind or is useless brings the team very far down.
 
***Now let's talk about some champions that can do this role.***
 
**VI. The Meta Champions** 

&gt;[](/ashe) Ashe
 
[Ashe](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ashe) is one of the best champions to learn ADC as. Ashe is a very powerful hyper-carry that provides high utility and damage, IE, BotRK, BT, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/caitlyn) Caitlyn
 
[Caitlyn](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Caitlyn) is a long-range ADC that utilizes her sniping abilities to counter champions with small attack ranges such as Quinn/Vayne/Graves. She is not a hyper-carry champion because most of her damage falls off late game while being superb early and the middle of the game. A general end-game build for Caitlyn is: Zerker's, BT, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/corki) Corki
 
[Corki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Corki) is a very old ADC champion that excels in poking team compositions. He has very high burst damage, and so he can be built in multiple ways. You can build the same as [Blue Ezreal](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dvndo/info_blue_ezreal_discussion_and_information/) and have *tons of damage*, or you can build more traditional, such as: Zerker's, Trinity Force, BT, LW, and a situational defensive item
 
&gt;[](/draven) Draven
 
Welcome to the Leeeeague of [Draaaaaven](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Draven). Draven is a medium-ranged ADC that excels in early game with the use of his Spinning Axe (Q ability.) He is extremely strong between the level 1-2 range, his strongest damage is from his Q ability and catching his axes again, which is very hard to do when being dove by a team. A usual end-game build for Draven would be: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW
 
&gt;[](/ezreal) Ezreal
 
[Ezreal](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ezreal) is an ADC champion that focuses more on casting his abilities than the traditional auto-attacking ADC champion. His strongest ability is his Mystic Shot (Q ability) due to it applying on-hit effects such as SS/Red Buff. Ezreal is best for poking team compositions, read [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1dvndo/info_blue_ezreal_discussion_and_information/). You can also go the traditional build of: Zerker's/Lucidity/Merc Thread's/Ninja Tabi, IE, SS, BT, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/graves) Graves
 
[Graves](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Graves) is a short-range, and because of that can rush items such as Zerker's + BotRK and still do optimal damage. Graves is not one of those champions. He is best mid game and also falls off late game. A usual build for Graves would be: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, LW, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/jayce) Jayce
 
[Jayce](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jayce) is a different type of ADC. While primarily, Jayce is able to use his higher-than-usual base health and ranged ability to keep pace with other carries. He excels in early to mid game, while, as usual, falling off late game. He is ideal for poking team compositions. A usual build for Jayce is: Merc Thread's/Ninja Tabi, Muramana, BT, LW
 
&gt;[](/kogmaw) Kog'Maw
 
[Kog'Maw](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kog'maw) is a hyper-carrying ADC champion that utilizes his ability Bio-Arcane Barrage (W ability) to do *tons of damage* to enemies. Kog'Maw is exceptionally strong late game, high-reward carry. Kog'Maw is best against champions such as Volibear/Nasus who stack health items, since his Bio-Arcane Barrage does percent health damage. A usual build for Kog'Maw is: Zerker's Greaves, BotRK, IE, BT, LW/PD depending on how much armor they have, Kog'Maw is extremely squishy and needs a good team composition to protect him.
 
&gt;[](/missfortune) Miss Fortune (MF)
 
[Miss Fortune](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Miss_fortune) is a caster ADC champion that scales perfectly into early and mid game, as Graves. She scales with attack damage, not attack speed, and is even better with armor penetration for her ultimate ability (R.) A usual build for MF is: Zerker's, BT, BC, IE, and sometimes a Banshee's Veil as a defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/quinn) Quinn
 
[Quinn](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Quinn) is a short-range, due to her breaking the ADC-rules of distance closing and being in another player's face, but she also presents high-reward for playing aggressive, but not foolishly. Quinn scales with attack speed extremely well, therefore a usual build for Quinn is: Zerker's, IE, BotRK, BT
 
&gt;[](/sivir) Sivir
 
[Sivir](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sivir) is an attack damage caster, debatably, extremely underpowered right now due to her not scaling as well as hyper-carries into late game, not having long range, and not scaling into mid game as well as champions such as Caitlyn. That being said, Sivir does very well against players who do not expect her. Using her Boomerang Blade (Q ability) on enemies for *tons of damage* is extremely satisfying. A usual build for her is: Zerker's, IE, LW
 
&gt;[](/tristana) Tristana
 
[Tristana](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Tristana) is a very old (and free!) ADC hyper-carry champion. She scales extremely well with attack speed due to her steroid-like ability (Q ability.) Tristana is strongest mid to late game, very scary. She can self-peel without items using her Rocket Jump, but that won't matter because the BotRK she uses will delay her needing to use an ability. She is the definition of an auto-attacking ADC champion, and she does it perfectly. A usual build: Zerker's, IE, PD, LW, BT or another situational item.
 
&gt;[](/twitch) Twitch
 
[Twitch](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Twitch) is a very squishy, IE, PD/SS, LW, situational item, BT.
 
&gt;[](/urgot) Urgot
 
[Urgot](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Urgot) is a caster attack damage carry, thus making him a mana-sucker. Itemization for Urgot is typically high armor and medium damage, such as: Ninja Tabi/Boots of Lucidity, Muramana, Iceborn Gauntlet, BT/LW, and two defensive items if not vastly ahead by mid game.
 
&gt;[](/varus) Varus
 
[Varus](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus) is an extremely strong champion. He his high burst, and does percent health damage. Varus is perfect for a mid-level ADC to learn with because he teaches everything more-advanced such as poking safely, chasing, and more. Varus's usual build is: Zerker's, BT, PD, IE, and a situational defensive item.
 
&gt;[](/vayne) Vayne
 
[Vayne](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vayne) is, and my favorite ADC champion. She is also a high-skill cap champion that requires extensive learning, playing, positioning, knowing all of the fundamental's of ADC'ing, and a little bit of luck and prayers to be perfect with her. I have never seen a perfect Vayne, though DoubleLift might be the closest I've ever seen. Do not forget that your Tumble (Q ability) is an auto-attack reset, you can attack, PD, BotRK
 
**VII. Itemization**
 
***Quick

""*Also, attack speed, and attack damage combine multiplicatively to improve your auto-attacks. Getting +5 AD is better if you have 2.0 AS than if you have 1.0, adding 10 DPS instead of 5. Increasing your AS will pump your DPS more if you have more AD, and crit, as a damage multiplier to your AD, gets better the more AD you have and the more times you're attacking. ADCs scale off of AD * AS * Crit. Early on, but they each get better the more of the others you have. That last 10% AS when you finish your build adds more DPS than even doubling your AD would have at level 1. This is why your job is to farm; your base stats suck, but so will going from 300 to 400. AP is cheap

*But Xedeth! Most of those builds look exactly the same! Why is that??*
 
The paths you take to each item aren't illustrated above because I wanted to explain how each path is different
 
[](/infinityedge) vs. [](/thebloodthirster)
 
*IE vs. BT When should you get which first?*
 
BT is almost always a first major item pickup for champions that scale best with attack damage
 
IE is mostly when you begin to fall-behind in damage

Also

/u/phroxzon made a really good point

[](/statikkshiv) vs. [](/phantomdancer)
 
*SS vs. PD When to use which?*
 
You'll notice that I didn't list SS in very many builds, where as SS is able to clear waves for safety, split-pushing, or farming.
 
[](/bladeoftheruinedking)
 
*BotRK When is it okay to build this first?*
 
Generally, if you are playing a champion with innate damage such as Quinn or Tristana, then it is okay to go BotRK first, especially when ahead on these champions. One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is rushing BotRK on champions such as MF or Graves. At that point, you have lost lane, and will lose mid game unless your team feeds you like crazy.
 
*Situational Defensive Items. Want to be more specific?*
 
A situational defensive item can be many things. This includes GA, Sunfire Cape, Warmog's, and even Randuin's Omen. Items, such as GA, Mercurial Scimitar, and Warmog's, and thus need a cleanse (de-buff) or magic resist. Other items, are best against teams that are mainly melee champions and/or attack damage teams where high armor wins.
 
[](/berserkersgreaves)[](/berserkersgreaves)[](/berserkersgreaves)
 
*Zerker's Zerker's Zerker's*
 
I don't really have a comment on that except I have never seen a Berserker's Greaves Ezreal ever consistently win games. (I am okay with being proven wrong here
 
**IIX. Orb Walking/Kiting and CSing - Your bread and butter.**
 
*What is Orb Walking/Kiting?* [Orb Walking/Kiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvMc3EZ2xk) is the use of moving while attacking to maintain positioning and continuing max damage per second. This is NEEDED at higher skill levels of play
 
*CS'ing, or farming, is the act of last hitting minions and monsters so that the lane does not push, keeping you in a safe portion of the lane to continue CS'ing. Something that happens to me is that I'll miss the first minion into lane, and after that I am on tilt because I will either over-compensate, or under-compensate. Don't do that. Just relax and fit it into a rhythm. Attacked too early? That's okay, worry about the one minion later. Just relax and focus.
 
**IX. Support and You.**
 
Support. Your best friend. Your second-brain, forget that, you guys/gals are one brain. What you think, he/she thinks, and vice versa. You have to understand one another completely. When you mess up, the support better have your back, and, vice versa. There is no *bot lane* without the *support*. To quote /u/gregidot, you ain't carryin' shit. Without my wards, without my stun
 
*Now
 
This isn't a support guide.
 
*What kind of support synergizes with the champion I am playing?*
 
An easy rule of thumb is this:
 
Hyper carries do best with supports that can sustain them through the roughest part of the game for them, and Janna can do this. Also supports that boost your stats, such as Nunu, Lulu, or, again, Janna.
 
Burst champions do best with supports that amplify damage or lock down a target, and Fiddlesticks.
 
Caster champions fit best with the same supports for burst champions
 
Poking champions are great with supports that can disengage, Taric, and Sona. Sona is ideal for poking champions due to her poking abilities and disengage abilities.

**X. Summoner Spell Discussion - What to use and when?**
 
[](/flash) &amp; [](/ghost)

It is almost always needed to take Flash, flash is the best summoner spell in the game due to its different functions and playstyles that it presents that Ghost can't.
 
As for secondary summoner spells, and Ignite are the other three options to use for secondary summoner spells. Each has pros and cons, and I shall list both.
 
[](/cleanse)

***[Cleanse](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cleanse)***
 
Pros:
 
Gets rid of ignite.
 
Gets rid of exhaust.
 
Gets rid of some crowd control abilities.
 
Cons:
 
Not an aggressive summoner spell.
 
Certain crowd control won't be affected (Malzahar's ultimate?)

""'Certain crowd control won't be affected by cleanse (Malzahar's ultimate?)' Just wanted to point out that cleanse doesn't affect supression (malz ulti
 
Doesn't help win trades unless the enemy is using ignite.
 
*Best used* on hyper carries to ensure that they can live through a team fight or laning phase.
 
[](/barrier)

***[Barrier](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Barrier)***
 
Pros:
 
Counters ignite.
 
Scales into mid game well.
 
Great for baiting the enemy into attacking you.
 
Cons:
 
Falls off late game.
 
Still leaves you open to crowd control abilities.
 
*Best used* on champions that are great early to mid game champions to help them live while also being aggressive.
 
[](/ignite)

***Ignite***
 
Pros:
 
Highly aggressive ability.
 
Great for finishing off an enemy.
 
Don't forget that it lowers healing.
 
Cons:
 
Easily countered by Protect or Cleanse.
 
Doesn't do as much late game.
 
*Best used* on very few
 
**XI. Team fighting - What's your job?**

Your job, it is better for you to do as much damage as possible. Meaning, it is perfectly okay to target the Shen if he is in your face, killing you, or is separating you from their carries.

**XII.Trading - Why does that guy have a shinier Charizard than you?**

Trading is the act of doing small, or even send them back to base.

*Why is this important?*

Successful trading with an opponent will deny him farm and cause him to fall behind in gold, and this will push you ahead.

**XIII. Lane Control - One simple video.**

[This is the act of using lane control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kxGQ3gWdrM) You can do this as an ADC by 'freezing' the lane, sometimes costing a kill, or are forced to play it safe and lose gold.

**XIV. What to do after laning phase and that sexy tower goes down?**

As /u/FozzieBearWasTheMan points out, instead of progressing the game.

Your job as an ADC, push it. To the limit, limit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3-JA49q-0o). After you have done that, go mid lane and push down that tower. Take dragon when it is up. Help top lane when you can. Do everything you can to help your team while also maintaining your role on the team.

**XV. Strategies**

[](/golem) &amp; [](/wolf)
 
*Double Golems/Wolves. When is this good?*
 
***This is not going to be relevant for very long. This will be changed so that it will no longer be worth doing in the upcoming patch.***
 
Doing this makes it so that you and your support can hit level two faster. This is best with champions who gain a stun, such as Leona, Taric, Fiddlesticks, etc.
 
*Lane Swapping. When is this good and what is this?*
 
Okay
 
Moving on from that, I can only tell you the basics because I have never had it work for me perfectly.
 
Lane swapping is best for when you are on purple side, taking an early turret, and re-swapping back to bot lane. This provides you with extra gold and more map presence, allowing for follow-up dragons to be easier, and for laning phase to be easier for you and your support. This is extremely difficult for YOUR solo top laner to do. They are forced into a 1v2 situation, and can have the same thing happen to them. Advanced strategy.
 
Can't tell you anything helpful about going mid. I think it provides more pressure against the enemy jungler and their buffs.
 
[](/dragon)*Dragon*
 
Completely forget a key part of this that /u/HotSake reminded me of. Dragon gives you an attack speed debuff
 
[](/baron)*Baron*
 
See above.
 
*(I'd love for more tips here. I feel it is lacking
 
**XVI. How other roles/teammates affect you.**
 
*How does top lane affect you?*
 
Assuming your solo top laner is a tank or initiator
 
*How does mid lane affect you?*
 
A good mid laner will often roam to bot, you better hit that CS slave.
 
*How does jungle affect you?*
 
Jungle is that awkward friend you have that helps you out from time to time,) it is extremely hard for them to gank. A successful gank from a jungler should usually be followed up by doing dragon/baron.
 
**XVII. Summary and Credits.**
 
tl;dr ADC is a role that does the most consistent damage, different builds, and different roles that some ADCs fill, but generally the first sentence describes them. Your support is your wife. That part is important too.

1370525867.0,1fseyt,Four things that you should probably be doing in solo queue but probably aren't,Tuchit,172,26,76,"Now, and even in diamond level games

**Strategy Number One: Decide on Your Strategy in the Loading Screen**

When you start a game

A lot of people go AFK during the loading screen. A lot of people just zone out and browse the net. This isn't a huge problem, and what is he likely to do? Is your jungler an early ganker or a later ganker? Who is likely to have an easy or hard time in lane? Who's up against a difficult lane? This will all drastically affect the strategy your team should take. On that note...

**Strategy Number Two: Lane Switch**

It's seen so often in professional games that games where people *don't* lane switch seem to have become the minority. Why aren't people doing the same in solo queue? There is absolutely no reason not to. If you are playing Brand against a Kassadin, and he's going 1v2 against an Ezreal/Sona, you will come out ahead in farm and be able to hold your tower for far longer than he can. 

A lot of very annoying solo queue stompers fall flat in 1v2. They can easily be countered by switching lanes and aiming to take a very early tower. Disrupt their gameplan with a smart switch. It works.

**Strategy Number Three: Objectives on Kills**

League of Legends is a game that revolves around killing the Nexus. That's all that matters. If you can kill the enemy Nexus

When you get a kill, but 5% will see this for what it is: an enormous opportunity to further push your team towards killing that Nexus, which is a turret. Or 50% of HP off the turret. Or a dragon. Or an invade. Every time an enemy dies, you should immediately think to yourself: what can my team do with this opportunity? Objectives steamroll other objectives as well. When you take a mid tower, that allows you to coordinate for a four man gank at bottom lane, which might have been a losing lane up until that point, but now you have two enemy towers down and a tremendous amount of map control. All of this started because you just made the most of an opportunity.

**Strategy Number Four: Ward and Invade**

This strategy is especially useful when the game is very close or your team is slightly ahead. It's rather self-explanatory but very simple. If you ward key choke points in the enemy jungle and neutral enemy buffs, pushing your lanes in, warding up the enemy jungle as a team of five, and going in together to catch somebody out seems like a much better way to go about things.

1376348189.0,1k8mnc,Diamond 1 rambling about supporting out of lane (for players &gt;=gold),JoncIaude,172,25,49,"Hi I'm Jonclaude

The biggest problem I've seen lower level supports have is getting caught. When your team is screaming at you to ward, getting caught is THE WORST thing you can do as a support. So like sprd said, ask your team to accompany you when you go to ward crucial areas (baron, dragon, etc) if you don't already have vision of the enemy team. If you don't have your team with you, and the enemy team is MIA, but you NEED to ward a certain location: ward EVERY bush you have to face check to get there. You have 5 stacks on your sight stone and only 3 wards can be out at a time

I'm sure there is much more detailed information on warding out there, this is because the vision provided by it gives SO much control. The middle of the map has the most movement, because you must pass through it to get bot or top (I know, sounds obvious) so having vision mid is vital to see where the enemy is posturing for a play. This means that, if your mid turret is down, you should ward mid lane, just out of the enemy turret’s vision range. In addition, should also be warded to further your lead. If you down their mid outer, when you down an inhib, you will know and possibly be able to catch them. Seriously though

Getting used to that ward might bump you up a rank or two honestly, I mean support their priority carry(The carry on your team that the other team is lusting to kill, it’s usually obvious). Now, there are some situations when the most fed person on your team is going to dive into everyone anyways (like Diana or Liss or something) which leaves you with your mediocre ADC to defend. Now you have a choice, you might want to just say fuck myADC and dive the other team's priority target (if your AD is significantly weaker than theirs and you're playing a support like leona). But if you played your support well in lane 6/10 your support will be ahead of theirs (I say 6/10 because at this level of play its very possible to just get shit ADCs). If your ADC is the enemy team's priority target, use ALL your shit defending him. Since you stated you play leona and zyra, this means you should blow ALL your shit on whoever is diving your ADC. Instinctively, but if you can CC the divers so much that your own ADC is AAing the whole time, it is 100% ok to use solar flare EXCLUSIVELY on J4. And yes

A word about exhaust though. It is a huge misconception that supports are required to run exhaust (I’d still run flash 100% time though). In arranged/competitive it’s ALMOST a requirement because you have to go into the game assuming the opponent is as good as you and assume that the game will play out as it should (with your ADC having the most gold at the end- this is empirically true in every competitive league. ADCs get the most gold when the game is played correctly). With these assumptions made, I’d say it’s needed in about half the games in solo q. This is because it is very possible to crush a lane in solo q and ignite allows you to do this better. If you get into a game while running ignite and don’t end up crushing your lane, then it’s not a huge deal and solo q isn’t about winning every game, its about taking calculated risks and winning 60% of games.(its ok to get shit on in 4/10 games if you can shit on the other lane in 6/10 games). So, when to take ignite over exhaust? When the enemy team has no high-burst diving champion and (Zed, Talon, Akali, you should be looking to win lane with ignite

P.S. This is by no means a complete guide to supporting, this information is much less relevant to you, because you should be focused on the basics which I'm sure are outlined in a multitude of other threads/guides.

1367947973.0,1dvget,On the problem of adopting high elo moves without understanding them.,Vaethin,165,20,72,"*This is largely based on what I see in Solo Queue.*

Back when I used to play Starcraft II I often times watched Day9. For those who don't know him : He has a daily Starcraft II show in which he  analyzes certain topics and games and explains to your average viewer why and what a the pro player is doing.

One of the things that really stuck with me and that I carried over to LoL is his advice on adopting certain tricks/gimmicks that pro players do

That is a behaviour that's rampant even in Gold and low Platinum so I wanted to adress a few of those behaviours:

**Smiteless blue buff:** While I appreciate that people have started taking their junglers seriously and giving them a lot of help at the beginning

Smiteless blue allows you to do your red buff more quickly and do early level 3 ganks (and a lot of them as well). If you are planning on doing early level 3 ganks then a smiteless blue buff is the way to go. If you don't - then it's not.

 Not smiting actually makes you lose more HP  than if you had smited it (unless your laners have high DPS at lvl 1, etc) this this actually makes your jungle slower because you are ""forced"" to do redbuff right after blue (or else you are wasting time in which you dont have your smite on CD). 

The better alternative would be the Wolves -&gt; Blue -&gt; Wraiths -&gt; Wolves or Twins -&gt; Redbuff -&gt; Wraiths route. No waiting

**Starting redbuff on manaless junglers**: ""LOL Shyvana

 Again this is a question of ""what do you want to do?"" Starting redbuff means that you can start ganking right after red-buff, so you can use your safeguard on a minion or a similar skill combination.

 If you start red and then don't immediately start ganking you are effectively wasting time on that red-buff . By starting blue your first gank will be a little bit later but it will be stronger and you will be able to gank more often.

**Warding one side of your lane as mid laner**: Now, that warding the wraith jungle entrance is a job half done.

 When you only ward one side of your lane you have to watch your other lanes to see if their jungle might be moving through the river. Also if you ward to your left and then stay on the right side of the lane then your ward is mostly useless - Ward one side and then stay on that side to be as far away as possible from the side that the enemy jungler can come from without you seeing. Seems obvious but apparently to some people it isn't.

**Lane-Ganks**: Before you do a lane gank (a gank in which you dont enter through the river but through the lane) you should check two things: 1) Can I enter the bush without being seen / can I close the gap faster than he can run away AND ""Would it be easier to just go through the river/the enemy jungle. Unless the enemy laner is auto-attacking the tower the distance you'll need to close for an enemy who is pushing your laner to the tower is pretty damn big. Lee Sin can often times do it

 Again, if your enemy is warding and overextending or if your laner is pushing and thus allowing you to get into the bushes. If neither of those are the case then you are wasting your time and you would be better off just going through the river or possibly through the enemy jungle. Remember: You can always ask if/where the enemy has warded, most people in low/mid elo aren't very secretive about their wards so walking around them is not a very big problem.

Well anyways

Have fun and good luck

1360681029.0,18dnpt,Countering the 4 man gank,xSaviorself,161,15,52,"We've all been in this position before:

You are either the ADC or support. The enemy ADC is ahead in CS, but all you can do is watch.

The 4 man gank is incoming. Your mid laner is following down towards bottom

The 4 man gank is a huge commitment to snowballing a lane and gaining a huge advantage. It seems like such a solid play

As the ADC and support you get dove under the tower once the minion wave reaches the tower. You need to not be there. Losing a tower alone is much better than giving a double kill to the opposing ADC or mid laner and a tower. Run away.

As a jungler and mid responding to this, take the top turret and roam down to mid lane to go for that turret.

If the pressure the opposing team is applying on your bot lane is simply too much to handle

The enemy likely thinks they have a free dragon. They are wrong. Chances are they are all weak or at least missing some health. Wait for the dragon to get low and force them to disengage. Follow up and steal the dragon or get a free quadra

The 4 man gank relies on the element of surprise and panic. Stay calm and cut your loses. Sometimes dropping a turret is advantageous to a lane so that they can farm safely and catch back up while the rest of your team defends and distracts. Remember that you need to make the plays if you want to win the game, take mid and top from the enemy. Punish them for being greedy.

TL;DR don't risk dying bot lane to the 4 man gank

For Example: Enemy mid laner roams bot

""WTF NICE MIA MID LANE GG.""

My answer most of the time to anyone complaining to any teammate about MIA's is simply ""Look at your minimap."" I feel like that isn't really accurate and condescending at this point to say.

So

. Have a mental image of what you expect to see when you look at the minimap. This is huge imo. If you look without preparing yourself

. Make a count of enemy champs

. Use any information you have to effect your decisions. Ex

. How vulnerable are you? How vulnerable are other ally lanes to ganks?


These are just a few things that have helped me. These kind of actions allow you to react in lane. The title is a little off because it's not all about ""not dieing to ganks."" For example,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,t3_15kdyj

1375254114.0,1jeob7,My views on how to raise your ELO.,milkeeway,170,31,87,"First off I would like to state that I am by no means discrediting anyone else and what they have to say on the subject. I think only with an accumulation of various inputs can we grow as people in any aspect we wish to succeed in.

I started off in Silver III and have now worked may way up to Platinum III and still have so much to learn.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

                                                    Bronze I-V/Silver V-III
If you are a Bronze/Silver player chances are you are suffering mechanically more than anything else. Most players of this Elo I have come into contact with have a healthy knowledge of the game. At this Elo you need to know what your champion is capable of but more importantly what the enemy champion and his team are capable of doing to you at any moment in time. You don't need to research cool-downs and mana costs for every champion in the game but it does not hurt to have a rough idea of what they are. Watch what your opponent does and how often to get a better idea.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Farming: 
You need to last hit as many creeps as possible. At this Elo don't think of how many minions you should have at 20 minutes. Think how many minions did I get out of that wave. If you missed 3 or 4 do better the next wave.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Harassing:
This is more advanced but anytime your opponent is trying to last hit and you can hit him without losing a minion yourself you are denying him farm. It takes practice and will not work in every lane match up but it can be extremely effective in securing your lead. He will try and harass you when you are farming as well.

Any time the enemy is harassing you on your side of the minions (for example standing in front of your minion wave) you have the upper hand. Throw out some of your spells or auto attacks and back off before he gets anything on you


Very few champions have enough early game burst potential to take an enemy from 100% HP to 0% HP. A mindset I see a lot of at Bronze is, throw everything you have at him and by this time you should have it. Don't be discouraged when your opponent gets away without a kill. Your goal is to do as much damage to your enemy all the while taking as little damage to yourself. It may sound simple but it is not practiced strictly enough. If your opponent has to back and you have full health you can continue to farm the lane and snowball even farther ahead of him so next time he comes back you will get the kill for sure. If you take too much damage you will be forced to back as well and your lead will be minimal. You don't always know for a fact you will get the kill so play like you won't. Play like you need to stay in lane as long as you can. The better your items the better chance you have of winning your lane and then the game.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Trading:
Trading was touched on a little above so I won't go into tremendous detail over it. Essentially you want to deal as much damage to your opponent while taking as little damage to your own character as you can. Repeating this act will in most cases result in killing your opponent or bullying him out of lane.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Proactive VS. Reactive:
A major problem with this Elo range is what I like to call proactive or reactive. Most of the time I see players ""reacting"" to situations. For example you go to farm a minion and the enemy harasses you and you ""react"" by backing away or throwing a spell at the enemy. You need to be thinking ""Ok I want that minion that's getting low there

This is a subject I understand all too well. My attitude was TERRIBLE I would say the worst in the game. I was in the top 1% of League of Legends most toxic players. The problem is at the end of the day I knew I was a shit person for saying those terrible things, I knew all of these things that people told me ""not to do"" or to ""improve on."" The problem was I would agree with them and then I would repeat the process. So how do you take what is seemingly common sense and instill it into someone else? How do you take someone with a bad attitude and give them a new outlook on the game?

YOU DON'T. There is no assemblage of words that is going to magically change your attitude. You can watch inspirational and uplifting YouTube videos and sure it'll help but for how long? You are not going to be as calm as some of those Pro players in LCS overnight. We live in a world of instant gratification and in many ways it's simply amazing for example having almost limitless amounts of knowledge available to us through our cell phones or computers. 

The downside is that we get accustomed to all things in life being this way. It's not because you're a bad person or less of a person, it isn't survival of the fittest, and every day we wake up and were still breathing until we're not. Turn off the auto pilot and realize you won't improve at League of Legends automatically. 

Do you wan't to lose a couple pounds and get that six pack? How about learn to play the guitar? Do you want to get out of Elo hell? Well sorry to be the one to tell you but you are not getting it overnight. If you don't give this game the respect you would give an instrument or something that takes dedication

To the guys that continually say ""I was like 19/0/15 but my team fed and lost the game."" CARRY HARDER, do something different because it obviously didn't work. Your team didn't NEED you to be 19/0/15 maybe they needed you to be 25/0/15 or maybe they needed that last Baron you guys lost, maybe they needed someone to ping that bush to say there were enemies, maybe they needed something other than what you did. Now let's say you had a perfect game. You hit LITERALLY every single CS in your lane, you ganked every lane successfully every time you killed your opponent in your lane. You got every Baron, every dragon, landed every skill shot, if you played that well every game you'd be Challenger. It's all about consistency

As much you need mechanical consistency you need consistency in your attitude even more.

I know this is a nightmarish long wall of text I just kind of wrote what came to mind in one sitting so if there are any grammatical errors I apologize and hopefully this will help at least one person. I will be on frequently to answer any questions or elaborate on anything. My goal is to do my part and help level out the percentages of players in each Division.

Warm Up:
For those of you that read my previous warm up post I am editing it. It was written on mobile very late last night and quite a few people disagreed so I wanted to touch on a few points.

Warm up games can be any other game mode besides Ranked. The reason they are important is to warm up your hands and your mind. Now every single person is different and everyone's day to day life is different. With this in mind some people may not feel the need to play a warm up. Personally I do not ALWAYS play a warm up game. This is generally only the case if I have performed other tasks that warm up my hands and mind.

Lets put it this way,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1375292271.0,nami,,t3_1jeob7
1374427521.0,1irbd1,Some Things I've Learned,RoboRevo,153,20,17,"I've only been playing League of Legends for about a year and I've only been playing ranked for about two months. I'm currently Silver IV and recently ran into a losing streak (lost 4 of 5 games).

I realized I was breaking the rules I'd put in place for myself when it came to other competitive games, and Go.

**Rule #1: Don't play on tilt.**

Did you just get trolled? Did the enemy jungler camp your lane while your jungle farmed wraiths for 20 minutes? Did someone on your team call you a newb and get under your skin?

You're on tilt. Walk away (or at least don't play ranked).

This idea comes from poker. If you get wrecked in a hand, took a twenty minute break, and when I came back, I won it all back and more (including a memorable trip Aces vs. trip Qs against the same guy who'd wiped my two pair).

How do I break this rule when playing League? I had a recent game where my jungle was just not working. I was getting outplayed severely by the enemy jungler, people. I was not in the right frame of mind. I should have walked away.

**Rule #2: Compromise with Your Opponents**

This rule comes from the game of Go

In Go

The same applies to League. If you try to defend your bot tower when all five show up

Don't be afraid to give up that dragon or that tower to your opponent. Just make sure the compromise is fair. While they five-man your bot tower

**Rule #3: Pay Attention to Your Opponents' Behavior**

My former roommate is a big deal in the Magic: The Gathering community. He's an amazing player with a sharp mental game. He can often tell what his opponent is holding a turn before they play it. It's pretty incredible to watch.

How does he do it? He watches his opponent. Just like in poker, too, and you probably recognize many of them already.

Has your top lane opponent suddenly left while the lane is semi-pushed? Check if the mid is gone. If so

Is your lane opponent normally careful and reserved

These are just a couple examples of watching your opponents carefully to predict their behavior. This is much more important for junglers, ""Where should I go that the enemy team wouldn't want me to be?"" ""How can I counter what they're trying to do?"" (Going where your opponent wants to be (counterjungling) is also a very good strategy in Go.)

**Rule #4: Learn from Every Game**

You just got beat? Did you call your opponents newbs? Did you complain about your bot lane? Did you whine that your jungler never ganks?

Congratulations. You have learned nothing from playing that game.

When you lose

Remember: unless you're a pro in the LCS

Negativity will not allow you to learn. You can be disappointed with yourself

* * *

These are some of the rules I have for myself when it comes to League. Hopefully they help someone else! And if there are any other rules people have they'd like to share,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,t3_1irbd1

Her ultimate allows her to dash three times whilst also dealing damage to targets around her. Found in mid lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Akali**: Energy-based melee assassin. She deals primarily magic damage. Beware when you have Mark of the Assassin on you

**Alistar**: A melee support tank focussed on applying CC in teamfights. He has a knockup on his Q and a charge/knockback on his W. He has a small AoE heal, so be careful. You can combo W and Q for a medium-ranged dash/knockup. Typically found bot lane, although sometimes jungle. Fairly high difficulty.

**Amumu**: Melee AoE jungler, and deals %HP damage on an AoE. His ultimate is a large AoE that deals a decent amount of damage and snares you. He is very prone to being counterjungled early game, and is quite reliant on his first blue buff. Almost always seen jungle. Easy to use.

**Anivia**: Medium-long ranged magic damage caster with high amounts of utility and damage output. Her Q is a very slow skillshot, revived after being killed. Susceptible to ganks due to her lack of mobility, also quite blue-reliant. Found in mid lane. High difficulty.

**Annie**: Short ranged magic damage burst mage. Her passive, that remains on the field for a short time afterwards. Her burst is *not* to be underestimated. When her stun is ready, you will be able to see a small smoky thing floating around her. Found in mid lane. Easy to use.

**Ashe**: Medium-ranged AD carry with a focus on utility. Can use her Q to gain a slow on her autoattacks. W fires a cone that slows, so be careful not to get caught by it. Standing behind minions in lane can help mitigate her harass with her W. Played in bot lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Blitzcrank**: Melee support with incredible displacement ability and deceptive tankiness. His signature skill is his Q: a long-cooldown skillshot that will grab the first target it hits and drag them to Blitz's location. He can follow this up with E: an autoattack modifier that will knock the target into the air. His passive gives him a shield based on mana

**Brand**: Medium-ranged magic damage burst caster. His passive applies a burn to you, gains a stun. His W, an AoE, gains extra damage. His E, a single-target spell, gains AoE splash. His ultimate, which does high amounts of damage and bounces

**Caitlyn**: High-ranged AD carry. Her Q has a long charge time, although it can be blocked by other champions. Her passive can be seen and heard as her gun cocks, which means her next shot will deal bonus damage. Has a large amount of poke, so picking a sustain support is a good idea. Quite weak mid game, but strong early and late. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Cassiopeia**: Medium-ranged magic damage caster with a focus on sustained damage. Her Q and W are ground-targetted poison spells, but she does have to get fairly close to deal the optimum amount. Tends to push her lane, making her quite easy to gank. Found in mid lane. Very high difficulty.

**Cho'Gath**: Melee tanky caster with natural tankiness and good utility. Mainly deals magic damage. His Q is a long ranged knockup with a fairly long delay. His W fires a silencing cone, gives him extra HP and increases his model size. Stacks up to six times. His burst damage is quite high, even when he does not build damage. Very versatile in his build options. Found in top lane, mid lane and the jungle. Average difficulty.

**Corki**: Medium-long ranged AD carry with good burst damage and mobility. His Q is a short ranged AoE with high base damage. His W is a dash with a fairly long range. His E shreds the armour of people in front of him

**Darius**: Melee bruiser who deals mixed damage, amplified according to how many bleed stacks you have on you. If this kills its target, the cooldown is refreshed. Very hard to trade with due to his huge damage output, although easy to kite, and easy to gank. Mainly found in top lane, although occasionally jungle. Fairly easy to use.

**Diana**: Melee assassin. Deals magic damage. Her Q is a curved skillshot that applies a debuff. W is a sheld that also deals AoE damage. E is an AoE pull. Her ultimate is a medium-ranged dash that deals magic damage

**Dr. Mundo**: Mundo is a melee health-based bruiser/tank that deals mixed damage. His Q is a fairly spammable skillshot that slows and deals magic damage upon hitting. His W deals magic damage in an AoE around him. E is an AD steroid that grants more the lower he is. His ultimate takes a chunk of his health and regens 50% of his max HP over the next few seconds. Also grants MS. Be wary of fighting Mundo 1 on 1 as his damage is very high. All his spells cost health

**Draven**: Draven is a medium-ranged AD carry with enormous potential damage output. His Q gives him a damage buff for his next autoattack, especially with multiple Q's. However, be careful of putting yourself out of position to catch an axe. Found in bottom lane. High difficulty.

**Elise**: Elise is a short-ranged magic-damage caster with the ability to switch into a melee form using her ultimate. In human form she has a single target nuke, an AS steroid and a leap that makes her untargettable for 2 seconds. When in spider form she will also have several spiderlings following her around. Her burst combo is very potent, particularly given the execute on her spider-form Q. Be careful not to get poked down and jumped on. Found mainly in top or mid lane, although sometimes jungles.

You guys are actually real good. 

Yes, but a lot of you seem to have champion mechanics, last hitting, roaming, etc all at the same standard of a lot of the people I've played against around 1700+ rating. Not to mention the mechanically best damn Jax player I've ever seen or played with, whose name I only wish I could remember.

The problem is, and when they get a kill it's all but ignored in light of negatives. I'd like to think that you guys are above that since you're here, but don't worry, I recon this new honour thing will start to have an influence on that in time. Even if a game isn't snowballing away, it'll sure seem like it.

There are a few little things, just as season 3 starts, that'll hopefully come in useful.

&gt;From the Jax who I mentioned earlier: Don't get disheartened when you're behind.

Early game means literally nothing if you can **maintain** the difference, even 10k gold means a lot early but as the game gets further on and everyone gets 2 or 3 core items, it comes down to player skill and champion mechanics moreso. This guy went ahead and farmed, got a phage and sheen, and triple killed the enemy by entering the fight after the initiation, putting him back in the game and winning it overall.

&gt;From the Xin who wouldn't shut up: If you need kills to win a lane

This guy mained Xin, and it's something I recommend - **familiarity is much stronger at this level than actual picks-counterpicks**. However he was quite obnoxious to our jungler, who was doing grand, because he only got him 1 of the 2 kills he asked for - literally said ""I need 2 kills to win lane, camp top please"". Farming is a legitimate way to reach late game - even hardpushing and roaming when they b. Also if you can *only* lane against champion x with kills, either don't pick yourself into the matchup, or play defensively and wait for the jungler to reach your lane - even if that puts you behind, you're well on your way up.

&gt;From the Evelynn: Listening is half the battle

This was just after froggen's lee mid thing in MLG, 98% of the time.


&gt;Supports; Don't underestimate and don't get complacent.

This is in there for obvious reasons - supports are such because they **provide essentially the same function with or without items**. But don't underestimate a support, catch the enemy off guard, you can potentially win a game. It's by no means my favourite roll (that's jungle, no question), but I find it a lot more enjoyable than top lane. Oh and speaking of that...


&gt;Picking Lane X because ""Getting out of Elo Hell"" guides say to

This is retarded unless you main a champion in that roll. As I said before, and you knock him on his ass. These guides are typically written by someone who mains that specific roll and it worked for them. Similarly, if you find you perfrom well in certain rolls on certain champions, keep doing that. Try using lolking to track your status for different lanes and champions.


&gt;Don't flame someone for picking a champion

This is that familiarity thing, Olaf, Jax, Malphite, and Eve in quick succession.


&gt;If you don't know what a champion can do

This is why new champs which are easy are ""OP"" and those which are hard are ""bad and should never be picked - omg why you troll"". If they know they can kill you if you make a mistake

&gt;Don't chase Singed

He's going to stomp wherever he goes right? I was too confident, played sloppily, and ended up hurting my team for the first two games. 

* Lack of communication, while NK says to hit a turret. We didn't establish who was the focus, and there were times I didn't know NK was being dived during team fights. 

* When you play when you're stressed out, you're probably going to give her another kill. Realize that there's nothing wrong with taking a break.

This Video will briefly cover:




* Custom Key Bindings
* Smart Casting on Abilities, and Auto Attacks
* Wards
* Flashing as well as flashing over walls

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4E7XlbovuQ





## Video Details &amp; Explanations (optional read)




""Custom Key Bindings""
It is best that you find key bindings that work for you personally but I formatted my key bindings to what I feel is a good standard template for all players. The only requirement for these key bindings is a mouse that has a scroll wheel




[Q][W][E][R], an Ally, and an Enemy. With smart + self cast she can have immediate access to all of the effects at the touch of one button. Regular casting with the range indicators active is set to [Shift] [Q], [Shift] [W], [Shift] [E], and [Shift] [R] so that players can use regular casting on certain abilities that are difficult to align such as Anivia's glacial wall. Having the range indicator active may slow down the spell speed but the last thing you want is for an Anivia to be ""helping"" your team in a pinch.




The same goes for Summoner Spells




Camera controls are all the same because they are perfect as they are except for the removal of Camera Lock. Your gameplay drastically improves by unlocking your screen allowing you to see incoming ganks or foresee danger as the enemy is about to set up a play. Some players suggest using the [spacebar] for something other than center camera but it gives most players more control over their character so I choose to leave it as default. It also plays very well with the item key bindings.




Items must be smartcasted for so many reasons that I will not list here. I chose to only use item slots 3,6 because no character will have more than that many items at any one given point or rather they shouldn't have that many active items.




Item 3 is set to [MB3] (clicking the scroll wheel)
Item 4 is set to [Alt] + [MB3]




The Alt key is directly to the left of the [spacebar] where your thumb will rest for a majority of the game; because you can click [MB3] then quickly hit [Alt] and [MB3] again I like to use these two slots for potions during the early game. Your right index finger no longer needs to left click to activate spells so it can be used to activate the potions while your right middle finger is free to still auto attack and the left hand doesn't leave [Q][W][E][R] to press any buttons. All DPS is still ready to be used and your healing and gaining mana simultaneously. This leads to quite a lot of successful trades and even a kill without having to trade your own life. After use your thumb can also press the space bar and easily retake control of your champion.




Items 5




[S] Key and [H] Key are shifting around




Keys [1][2][3][4] are now free and open slots since we customized our item slots, a tower, a dragon, a minion, etc, and still power up your abilities. It also allows for quick ult use on lvl 6 which usually determines how a fight will turn out.




Everything else should be left at default and remember to disable all secondary key bindings because you don't want to accidentally use something during an important fight.




""Wards and Flash""




These were primarily something players call ""Safe warding""




The flashes were pretty flat out basic
*Warning Some of these flashes are only capable with blink ability champions so be warned that not all of these spots are possible just using flash*




Thanks for reading and watching, or constructive criticism on my videos. I'm very thick skinned so be brutal if you must.

Excuse my poor English as it isn't my first language. As always good luck in Solo Que and have a wonderful day.

1372848444.0,1hk652,Effective rune pages: For beginners. A comprehensive guide to having the right runes for the right role.,akigo57,151,24,97,"**Runes** and Masteries are important parts of any game of League of Legends. Having specific runes can help out your **early

.

This post will be divided by roles

.

**BEST GENERIC RUNES:**

We all know that when you first start out playing league of legends, you can simply have a rune page set up like this to ensure that you're not running AD quints on a Soraka.

The absolute best generic rune page for any champion:

* 3x Move Speed Quints
* 9x Hybrid Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.

This allows you some flexibility. Move speed is great on every champion

.

**BEST APC RUNE PAGES:**

An APC is an ability power carry

* 3x Ability Power Quints OR 3x Magic Penetration Quints
* 9x Magic Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Glyphs


This is ideal for most APC champions

.

**BEST ADC RUNE PAGE:**

ADC champions are attack damage carries

* 3x Attack Damage Quints OR 3x Lifesteal Quints
* 9x Attack Damage Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

This rune setup is ideal for most attack damage champions, and Talon. Lifesteal Quintessences are ideal for ""Safe Lanes"" and usually I see points thrown into the Utility Mastery Tree to get the 3% Lifesteal found within.

.

**BEST SUPPORT RUNE PAGE:**

There are several schools of though on the best support runes. Generally safe support lanes will tend to run gold per-10 quintessences. More aggressive lanes may choose to use Armor

* 3x Gold Per-10 Quints
* 9x Hybrid Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

This will help provide a safe sustained lane

.

**BEST AD JUNGLER RUNE PAGE:**

* 3x Move Speed Quints
* 9x Attack Speed Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

.

**BEST AP JUNGLER RUNE PAGE:**

* 3x Ability Power Quints
* 9x Magic Penetration Marks
* 9x Armor Seals
* 9x Magic Resist Per-Level Glyphs

.

**TOP LANE RUNE PAGE:** 

I can't actually suggest specific runes for top lane

.

**Disclaimer** : These are meant to be generic runes for generic roles. Obviously there are some champions like Ryze that will find Ability Power, more specific runes are appropriate. If you have questions about specific champions, feel free to ask. Also feel free to expand upon what I have added here.

**Major Edit:

Several people have made the great suggestion that Supports often take Armor Marks, and work very well for specific roles, and specific situations.

I wanted these to be usable by most champions for various things

A mid lane AP champ won't completely suffer for taking AD Marks

I hope this helps people understand the point of this guide. If people would like the best runes for specific match-ups, and only have two - three rune pages, and only have them set up for say a life steal, crit chance, ADC or a AP per-level support with GP-10; you're going to be forced to take those mid sometimes when you're last pick, or someone says ""DUO BOT OR FEED"".**",,self,,

**CAVEAT**: This post applies to competitive (Ranked) play. Surrender in Normals whenever you want; they're supposed to be fun

A sub-thread about when to surrender popped up in my [Win quickly

&gt; Sometimes it is just completely unattainable. Defeat is inevitable. So you surrender to save yourself time.

...

&gt; So you would rather force your will on 4 other people who don't want to play anymore? And besides if your team decides the game is lost

The problem with this mentality is those games where you're insanely behind, your jungler is saying ""It's not stupid of us to surrender, it's selfish of you to waste our time and force us to keep playing""...

... and then you win.

It's happened to me enough times that I'd have to take my shoes off to count it for you.

The problem with this mentality is that *you never know*.

The only time I surrender is when the enemy team literally walks away from our Nexus when it only has a few hits left *just* to draw the game out so they can have more fun being fed. But in pretty much *every other* situation--it's 2 - 18 and they pushed to your inhibitor turrets by 10 minutes--it's still anyone's game.

*If the enemy team plays perfectly*, which means you're only ""wasting"" a few minutes anyway. If they don't close out the game quickly, *anything can happen*.

1. Your jungler might reconnect.
2. Their insanely fed carry might disconnect.
3. They might get sloppy enough for you to catch two of them out and feed the shutdown kills to your carry
4. They might have a bad team comp for sieging
5. You might not actually be as behind as you think you are.

That's how it is. Everyone bitches about being in Elo hell, it's true for your opponents, too. Either you're in Elo hell and it's overwhelmingly likely that your opponents will eventually throw their advantage, or you're up against a Diamond smurf who's going to wreck your Nexus in a few minutes anyway. But you have to pick one; it can't be both.

I'm gonna tell it to you straight: if you totally check out of a game as soon as it seems like you're not going to win, what would they do? The answer is damn near never going to be ""surrender"".

Surrendering because you probably won't win is like bitching about the ""friend zone"". **OH NO**! You connected with another person and made a friend who you can trust and confide in. But you didn't get laid! Guess all that time making a friend was wasted.

We focused on adc

 * Part of the reason why you don't see pro smurfs having many bad games (whole team feeding) on stream is because they are such a presence in lane. High elo players on a smurf will often draw the attention of the enemy jungler (and possibly mid) and cause the enemy team to be focused on a particular area. This allows the jungler on the smurf's team to set up ganks in lots of lanes, if you are creating a strong presence in lane, it is harder for the rest of your team to not be ahead.
 * One way to create lane presence in bot lane is to push the lane (autoattack enemy minions, you can force the enemy adc to last hit under tower (and in lower leagues they will miss a lot). In addition, the enemy bot lane will be discouraged from trading because you have more friendly minions with you. Pushing also attracts the enemy jungler to bot lane, and if you have decent warding then the enemy jungler just ends up wasting his time or having to 'lane tax' and take some farm from his own adc.
 * In lower leagues, and Varus for bronze/silver/low gold because they can dominate a lane even without much support presence.
 * AD Carry needs farm the most. In one game, you need to be looking for opportunities to farm and pressure. If your team has not taken their outer top tower but is grouping up to do it, decide whether your team has 'enough' for that tower. If so, go find a lane (or jungle) where you can farm so you can keep up your gold-per-minute. If you see the enemy team coming to take out your team after your teammates finish the tower, you obviously need to get over there and help the teamfight, but by not being there in the first place (because your team had 'enough' for the tower), you avoid the common low league issue of having bad adc positioning at the start of the teamfight. By having to 'get there' and not already 'being there', which is exactly what you should be doing as adc anyway.

**Lane Positioning**

 * Harass position and safe farm position. Both are used for last hitting. Harass position is standing near the front of your allied minions (and often near the minion the enemy adc is about to cs). If the enemy adc comes to last hit
 * Your positioning is based on the lane matchup. For example
 * The positions are dynamic, you can reenter harass position. 
 * Wildturtle is a great example of someone who knows these positions well

**I lost my tower early

 * Slow-rolling. This is when you have a wave pushed to one of your inner towers. Instead of clearing the wave quickly

**Why you may suck at trading in lane**

 * Enemy bot lane engages on your support and both of you try to run. If your support is being focused
 * Enemy support and adc stand relatively near each other. The enemy supports shoots you and you shoot him back, although do realize that taking damage from a support and shooting the support back means the enemy adc likely has more health than you and is now slightly ahead.
 * There are more enemy minions than friendly minions

1371184098.0,1gbhqf,Foxdrop's Aatrox jungle first impressions,foxdrop,142,19,57,"""Who's foxdrop? Why do I care what he thinks?""

I'm a high Diamond jungler and I do educational videos over on Youtube (www.youtube.com/foxdroplol) mostly about jungling. I also try to post here to help people out where I can. To that extent



So first impressions of Aatrox as a jungler is that he is severely underwhelming. Like

Aatrox as a champion is someone with no middle ground. He is either godly or useless. If he's fed he's unkillable in pretty much any scenario

His clear speeds are decent but rely on his abilities that cost WAY too much health- 10% on his Q and 5% on his E, meaning he can actually heal off using his abilities in the jungle.

This means that in order to have competitive clear speeds he needs to sacrifice a lot of HP which brings about some very obvious flaws. Early on

His passive (increases Attack Speed) also takes quite a long time to charge

His kit for ganking is ok, Aatrox!"". He can get the job done but really is nothing special. Any time you rely on chaining together auto attacks for the majority of your damage, you instantly lose a lot of gank pressure because people will just walk away from you. A Q-E combo won't lock someone up for long enough to take them out in the same way that a Rammus would. 

Let's put it this way: Trynd has a better and more reliable gank potential than Aatrox- his Q+E will lock someone up for between 2.75-3.75 seconds (1 second knock up, Aatrox's E does damage and Trynd's W doesn't, but the extra slow duration (more than double early on) is more than enough early to compensate for that.

I found moderate success with Aatrox when I would just sit and farm in the new jungle (yay new jungle). But I was thinking to myself to whole time: ""what benefit am I getting playing this guy over someone like Nocturne?"" I didn't have a good answer for that because

Aatrox's only saving graces are his Ulti and revive passive. His ult is similar to a Kayle E except it grants Attack Speed instead of extra damage+splash, especially people like Sejuani who's Ults are also amazing outside of ganking. 

The revive passive means you can get some cheeky tower dives off early on because you drop tower aggro when you're reviving (due to being untargettable), etc.

However, and having access to a lot of farm and the potential to get really fed also means he can become ludicrously strong (as with every champ, but highlighted even more so with Aatrox). He'll just stand there destroying your team without dying- he also gets double regen off his W when he's below 50% health, meaning the lower health he is the harder he is to kill. 

Anyway,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1371184405.0,aatrox,default,t3_1gbhqf

I'm a frequent poster and reader of r/summonerschool - I usually delete my stuff after it gets answered but I've asked over a dozen questions on here as well as Monday megathreads on r/leagueoflegends.

Recently I've noticed that summonerschool has become much less helpful. It is a cesspool of wasted time because most of the threads have no content.

Looking at the front page as I write this:

* TWO threads advertising streams
* FOUR people offering or begging for mentorship help
* THREE guides that boil down to ""be smart, if any, on these posts.
* THREE posts of people complaining about their elo or how riot's tier system work. No question about the actual game answered.
* TWO posts of people begging people to review their replays.
* TWO posts of people asking about technical problems in league
* TWO posts asking about ""when to start playing ranked""

Of all the posts on the first page, my browser renders 25 threads per page. That means barely over 20% of content is what I would consider acceptable, informative content. The other 75% is fluff, wasted space for most, and waters down the subreddit.

I'm sorry if this comes off as complain-y

I am only slightly motivated by the fact that a lot of my recent summonerschool posts, are frequently buried and ignored because of these other types of posts. I've had to delete 4 or 5 questions because I only got troll responses or responses from people who are teh same elo as me (silver), and usually only 1 or 2 comment replies anyway.

So there's a couple of things to know about minion waves:

* Melee minions have more health than Caster minions

* Melee minions have higher armor than Caster minions

* Melee minions deal less DPS than Caster minions

For all these reasons, but it will take them a fairly long time to kill off the melee minions of the enemy wave. During this time, your next friendly wave will catch up and you will have a big old wave all in one go. Obviously doing this to 2 consecutive waves will further snowball the wave.

Thanks to you all

**General Notes**


*Top*: I've learned what it means to be a bully and what it means to really just farm under tower. I've learned the importance of CS. Most importantly, it's my job to peel for the carries and make sure they're safe while I still dish out or absorb damage.

*Mid*: Holy hell, simple auto-attacks on the enemy can make a huge difference. Just like top, start pushing and start roaming. Watch that god damn mini-map, you're so easier to gank than Kim Kardashian walking through Harlem. 

*Jungle*: My new home &lt;3 Volibear jungle carried me the hell out of bronze. I don't care about getting fed, you sure as hell know that I'll do it. Bronze lacks initiation power, and that's where I found Voli to help me. One small catch, and the fights started. 

*ADC*: I honestly just started acting like Doublelift to get better. I picked up Vayne, a quick pin to the terrain and true damage will get you out. 

*Support*: Poke enemies, ward up, initiate the fuck out of the fights. Keep your damn ADC alive. 


I like this quote to sum up ""how to carry out of ELO hell"": *If you want things done right, be the one who sets the tempo. Stop assuming people actually know how to play League of Legends. Only YOU know how to play, so get out there and win that damn game.

1372315016.0,1h5xe5,Misunderstandings that ADCs have that I've seen many times while smurfing(Silver-Currently Gold) (Diamond I ADC Main)(x-post from r/leagueoflegends),JimsterG,143,32,108,"ADCs in the lower ELO Range around high silver to currently gold seem to be misunderstanding several things about the bottom lane match up and itemization in general.

**1. Last Whisper is a very important item**

The main thing about LW is that it reduces 35% of a target's armor. This allows you to deal significantly more damage to bruisers and tanks. Get this item either second or third depending on your champion or depending on if the opposing team has bruisers with higher than 100 armor. Generally

**2. Prioritize people who are close to you rather than their carries**

I've been seeing a lot of people diving into their team in order to try and kill the opposing team's carry. You don't need to this or rather you shouldn't do this. Leave this job to your bruiser/tank. You will die if you go in too deep and this usually results in a lost fight. If the opposing team's carry is low

**3. On the bottom lane match-up

I've seen Draven/Fiddles(incredibly broken lane btw) farming in the back and barely even trading hits with the opposing carry. The deciding factor for who usually has the better kill potential depends on the support. If you have a support such as Taric, etc, you will generally have a better kill potential than say a Janna, Sona, Lulu. But if the supports are even in kill potential, then the ADC is the deciding factor on whether or not you want to try to go for the kill. Ezreal, Draven, etc, you want to trade as much as possible and just play it safe.

Edit#1:

**4. Capitalize on your opponent's mistakes**

This also goes hand in hand with trading during lane. Let's say you're playing Vayne, so your best move would be to go in, hit once, and Q for the extra hit. This is the most standard way to win lane and if you do it better than your opponent, you will win lane 90% of the time. Also, remember when to retreat. Take your gains and don't push too far for more. A bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush. If you burn their summoners, and they retreat to tower then just go back and farm your wave. You will be likely to kill them the next time they return to lane. If they burn their flash ask for a gank or just kill them if your lane has kill potential because they won't be able to get away.

Edit#2:

**5. If the enemy team has an assassin

If the enemy assassin can 100 to 0 you, LeBlanc, Talon, and Lee Sin(if mid). The type of champions that will kill you within 1-2 seconds. Your best choice is to stay back so you force the enemy mid to dive your front line, which usually does not end up well. Your second option would to be to wait for the assassin to burn their skills on another target and then go join the fight. Remember. Your main priority as the ADC is not to die and dish out as much damage as possible.

Edit: If the assassin waits for you

**6. Don't be afraid to take their tower and not have a place to farm**

I have encountered multiple ADCs that didn't want me to take the tower because they wanted a place to farm. Taking a tower provides three things that help your team. First, you take away vision from the opposing team which is a huge deal. Do you remember during high level matches or during pro matches that they place down a ward where the tower used to stand or around that area to gain vision? Vision is one of the most important things in the game because the information that they provide and if the enemy team doesn't have that information, they are more likely to make misplays.

Edit#3:

**7.Keeping your CS high is very important through mid game and into late game**

I've seen many ADCs' farm count fall off by the 25 minute mark because they waste so much time in places that they don't need to be. Here's a general rule to follow by. ADC has the highest farm priority in the game so it doesn't matter if you steal CS in other lanes while pushing it. You don't want to leave bot unless your team is forcing a team fight or some objective is being taken. Try to always return to bottom lane after you base because you can always pick up a few cs here and there. If nothing is happening then stay at bottom lane. If the enemy ADC is a lot stronger than you and is currently farming(mid/late game where the ADC farms alone at bot) then let them push and clear the wave then leave. Bottom lane is your home where you should always return to.

1352131011.0,12o6dy,The psychological aspect of League of Legends,CG_BQ,135,23,30,"First of all, this is very important to note!

By SkaterLolPlayer:

&gt;I believe there to be three aspects of League of Legends: psychological, and they’re often times linked.

&gt;Players spend long hours working on their mechanical and strategic skills

&gt;Example. Early game, and the invasion is a bust. In this situation, Blitzcrank is likely under a tremendous amount of pressure and feeling enormous anxiety, while the rest of your team is probably the same.

&gt;Here’s a fact of life: nobody performs better in high anxiety situations. Some people claim to do well under pressure, they don’t care that they’re being watched. They may even like the attention.

&gt;This is how winning and losing streaks both occur. When you start winning, oppositely, when you go on a losing streak, this is where your mechanical skills fall apart, as you get highly tense and feel an enormous need to play better. People often react to this situation by demanding their bodies to practice more to overcome how bad they’re doing, when in fact it may be time to turn the game off.

&gt;I suggest here that you simply never care about this game. Yes, should honestly never give half a damn about how well a certain game goes or doesn’t go. You should just feel in the zone and enjoy yourself at all times. You should allow your body, and not your mind, to play the game for you.

&gt;How do you do this? How do you become a psychologically sound beast?

&gt;1.) Don’t care about how your team is doing

&gt;If your team is feeding, and will make you a worse player.

&gt;2.) Don’t care about how you’re doing

&gt;If you’re feeding, getting honored by the opposing team multiple times after. When you allow somebody on your team to get to you, it’s not only on them; it’s on you too. You need to have elephant skin. Again, high anxiety = reduced performance, and reduced performance creates for even higher anxiety. You’re only hurting yourself when you let it get to you. And, chances are, unless you’re like 2600 ELO you’re never going to be playing with these people again. They are insignificant.

&gt;3.) Learn when to call it quits

&gt;I often see very good players continually queue, you need to stop playing for a while. Don’t allow yourself to continue getting angrier and angrier as the game continues to get worse and worse. Log the hell off, do some things to calm you down, and play again later. Your mechanics will never develop like this.

&gt;League of Legends is a fun game, feel. Don’t stress, enjoy. A poor mental state will make you bad at the game. I’m talking about anxiety here. Master your psychological state, and you will no longer have good and bad days. You will always play at your best.

&gt;I am not an amazing player. I tend to be between 1350 and 1600 ELO at any given time. If you’re looking for pro advice, so if you have your own ideas, post them here. I’m happy to read them with an open mind.

Yep, its broken as hell. If played right she should dominate her lane and transition well into late game as a peeler/damage dealer.

A quick note before we dive in: a lot of this is personal preference

**Runes**: 9x AS reds, 3x AS quints.

**Masteries**: 21-9-0 is good

**Skill order**: Take [](/lulu_q) at level one

**Items**: Start with [](/bootsofspeed) + 3 [](/healthpotion). Lulu has the slowest base movement speed in the game (tied with a few AD carries), namely [](/mercurystreads) and [](/ninjatabi). After that, you're really flexible. A [](/trinityforce) is always good considering how low the cooldowns on your spells are and how good your chasing power is. The movement speed is very welcome too. [](/hextechgunblade), whilst expensive, caters for most of your needs as well, and gives your skills a bit more of a punch. If you find yourself having to initiate, [](/randuinsomen) is really strong, and as usual

**General tips**

For laning with Lulu, I've had them all. Your autoattack harass is insane, and with the runes I said you should be hitting ~0.8 AS, allowing you to pull off constant poke. [](/lulu_q) and [](/lulu_e) have very high base damage, and when used in an EQ combo, deals heavy damage and sets up for a string of autoattacks. With the speed boost on [](/lulu_w) and the 80% slow on [](/lulu_q), you're gonna be very hard to gank, use [](/lulu_r) on the initiator, whoever's a bigger threat)

1. ""Leashing"" has changed since S2.  One auto-attack from the mid-laner just doesn't cut it anymore.  I use about 2 extra potions on a smiteless start if you don't stay around to damage my buff.  3 CS in your lane is not worth the risk of me not being able to level 2/3 gank.

2.  If I start at blue

3.  If I encounter the enemy jungler in our jungle you should come help if possible.  Those frantic pings are for a reason.  He's in our territory and should be treated just like a trespasser in Texas.

4.  If I have more CS than the laners at the 10 minute mark then we have a problem.

5.  If you're 0/3 when the second blue buff comes up

In addition

1.  I already ""ganked"" your lane

2.  You don't have a single ward and the enemy jungler is MIA.  I REALLY don't want to give up a double kill to the top-laner in addition to the double assist Lee Sin just got.

3.  You've fed Darius 5 kills by 15 minutes.  There's a very real possibility he can 1v2 us

4.  You pushed your lane to the opposing turret.  I'm not diving at level 4.  If I have confidence in you I'll try to set up a lane-gank.

5.  You complain that I don't gank bot immediately after I secure a level 2 kill in top lane.

[Link to part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/p3win/a_basic_rundown_of_all_the_champions_master_yi/)

* **Ahri**: Plays AP mid. She's a burst caster with a really strong cc that can lead to kills. Has really good sustain
* **Akali**: Plays any solo lane. Burst assassin with a long range jump that deals tons of damage. Not mana dependent
* **Alistar**: Played as a support. A cc machine that has a weak
* **Amumu**: Excellent jungler. Has a lot of cc and a % of health AoE. His ult is a god and teamfights and does huge burst damage.
* **Anivia**: Great AP mid. Good Anivias wont die because of egg form. AoE slow and a nice stun with a lot of damage. Moderately high skill cap.
* **Annie** : AP mid that isn't that strong compared to the rest. Without ult can't 100-0 much
* **Ashe**: AD carry that has fallen off compared to the new ones. Infinite slow with auto attacks
* **Blitzcrank**: Normally played support. Very strong kill potential with grab and knock up. AoE silence gives huge edge in team fights. A very strong pick currently.
* **Brand**: Strong burst caster. Has % of health damage on each of his spells
* **Caitlyn**: Very strong AD carry. Probably the BEST early game of all the bottom lane carries currently. Really good at farming and has a lot of damage with Headshot. Not as hypercarry as Vayne
* **Cassiopeia**: Very strong AP mid. Not that much sustain
* **Cho'Gath**: Safe top lane pick. Passive lets hit sit in lane and farm all day
* **Corki**: A good AD carry pick. His only real weakness is that he has to be in peoples face to get the full damage off
* **Dr. Mundo**: Somewhat weak currently. Been recently buffed and clears jungle really fast. Bad early game
* **Evelynn**: Very weak in the current meta. Doesn't fit into a specific role
* **Ezreal**: A so-so AD carry. Doesn't have that much damage
* **Fiddlesticks**: AP mid but more commonly jungler. With the recent arrival of a ton of AoE junglers
* **Fiora**: Okay top laner and jungler. Decent clear times in the jungle
* **Fizz**: Strong AP mid choice wil pretty high skill cap. Once mid game starts
* **Galio**: AP mid that has a lot of farming potential. Can be really tanky with MR (which turns to AP)
* **Gangplank**: Solo top jungle mid AD carry or support. Seriously this guy can play any role well... But he just facerolls solo top early game. Just press Q and farm minions and he'll win. Global ult that slows is super strong
* **Garen**: Great solo top pick. Can just sit in lane and farm, either.
* **Gragas**: Strong AP mid pick. Has a LOT of lane sustain and his ult is a god in teamfights if placed properly. Has a decently high skill cap
* **Graves**: Excellent AD carry. He can just sit there in lane and farm while being able to exchange with almost anyone with his q. Very strong throughout the entire game
* **Hecarim**: Decent jungler. Good clear times and ganks. Strong initiate ultimate that is somewhat hard to use. Can be very dangerous if built bruiser, but overall meh at the moment.
* **Heimerdinger**: Pretty weak currently. Without turrets he's not very strong 1 on 1, though.
* **Irelia**: Very safe solo top. Doesn't need to leave lane and can farm very well. By mid game has a lot of damage
* **Janna**: Very good support. Shield gives AD for the carry
* **Jarvan IV**: Strong jungler with decent ganks. His ult pretty much isolates 1 person
* **Jax**: Recently changed completely. Still good solo top
* **Karma**: A meh support all around. Good Karma's are amazing
* **Karthus**: Very strong mid. Has great harrass and can clear waves and sustain for a very long time. Can just suicide and press R to win teamfights
* **Kassadin**: Another strong mid. Has good CC and can chase very easily. Very good burst assassin
* **Katarina**: Good mid that isn't mana reliant. Passive + ult can lead to teamfight victories
* **Kayle**: Not very good currently. Although her ult is a god
* **Kennen**: Amazing solo laner. Not mana dependent
* **Kog'Maw**: Great AD carry. Very long range + % of health auto attacks give him and excellent late game
* **Leblanc**: Extremely powerful mid. Can 100-0 and 1 shot almost anyone. Has one of the best early games of any champion
* **Lee Sin**: Very strong jungler and solo top. Probably the best jungler right now, and he's an amazing pick.
* **Leona**: A good support with a lot of cc. Her passive lets her and her AD carry do a bunch of damage
* **Lulu**: A strong, polymorph (hex from wc3/dota). Very decision based, she must decide whether or not to have more survivability in fights or more damage. Overall good pick for top mid or support.
* **Lux**: A decent support and AP mid. She has some good cc that can lead to strong ganks and exchanges. Her ult is funny
* **Malphite**: Good solo top and jungler. Although he's outclassed during early game
* **Malzahar**: A stong mid pick. Without innate escape tools, and he clears waves very fast.
* **Maokai**: Strong jungler and decent top lane. Clears the jungle pretty fast

1366579042.0,1ctkup,Itemization Optimization for AD Carry Guide,Chzeburashka,125,15,71,"**Optimal Itemization for AD Carries according to their kits**

**Abbreviation Key:** 

*AD* = Attack Damage

*BT* = Bloodthirster

*IE* = Infinity Edge

*PD* = Phantom Dancer

*Shiv* = Statikk Shiv

*LW* = Last Whisper

*BotRK* = Blade of the Ruined King


In most games an *AD* carry won't get past building 3 or 4 core items. With this being the case

There's also the more recent but somewhat strange build of *BotRK &gt; IE &gt; LW*

It's also worth noting that *BotRK* should be thought of as a replacement for *BT* as it is a non-*AD* heavy option for lifesteal.

I'll also add that there's no defensive item section here because they have nothing to do with an AD Carry's kit (maybe an argument could be made for Warmog's being best on Graves because of his passive...but that's kinda lame). Defensive purchases are REACTIVE and should be purchased when needed according to what the ENEMY team is composed of in terms of champions.

**Initial core variation**


1. *BT/IE*
2. *PD/Shiv*


**BT First Champions**: Basically their kits scale well off of *AD*. 

This could mean that either they have high *AD* scaling abilities 
(Graves, Sivir) AND OR strong scaling Auto attack modifiers (Draven, Vayne, Caitlyn)

The following champions should build BT first according to qualities listed above: 

-Caitlyn (passive Q and R scale), and R), Ezreal (Q and R), Graves (Q and R), Miss Fortune (Q and R), Sivir (Q and W), Varus (Q and E)

**IE or BotRK first Champions:**
These champions basically have either no or very little *AD* scaling

-Ashe, Twitch

**PD Second Champions:** A champion would prefer having a phantom dancer if (and only if) they have an auto attack modifier (or an enhanced auto attack) in which case a higher % crit chance 
will add more to his or her overall damage output

-Caitlyn (her passive), Sivir (her W), Twitch (his R), Vayne (her Q and R)

**Shiv Second Champions:** Static Shiv is an item that somewhat shores up the weaknesses of non-*AD* scaling carries by providing damage that scales with attackspeed. Note that choosing this item leaves you with less attack speed and Critical strike chance than *PD*

-Ashe, Kog'Maw, Tristana, Twitch (Has weird strong interaction because of his R), Varus

**Ugly Duckling AD Carries that don't follow the rules**: Ezreal

*Note that these champions can still be built according the mentioned item cores

Ezreal is the only duckling of these three that is good in his ugliness. He can build just about any *AD* item and get away with it.

Corki is in a bad place right now. He has mediocre AD scaling, and his spells all deal magic damage.

Quinn feels more like a solotop to me and most. Her kit has a high number of skills that scale with *AD*

**Complete variation in no particular purchasing order:**

*IE* &lt;AND&gt; *LW* (CORE, *BT* &lt;OR&gt; *BotRK*

**Quick Lookup builds according to champion** (See above for explanation)

These are basic 4 item cores that use our knowledge of the champion's kits above. 

Note that the buying ORDER presented below might vary slightly according to each 
champion's unique kit

You should also keep in mind that Last Whisper IS a core item for ALL AD carries
purchased reactively WHEN the enemy team starts stacking armor. 



[](/ashe) **Ashe**  - *IE, BotRK*


[](/caitlyn) **Caitlyn** - *BT, IE* (Now, personally, I prefer going IE on Caitlyn first. The only reason I put BT is because the numbers are THERE and it's hard to argue with numbers :c)

[](/corki) **Corki** - *IE, BotRK* (He has stranger build options, but this one should work as a standard build from the parameters listed. Other items include Trinity Force and Manamune)

[](/draven) **Draven** - *BT, IE*

[](/ezreal) **Ezreal** - *BT, IE* (Ezreal's kit lends itself to some interesting item variation, such as Manamune, Iceborn Gauntlet and Spirit of the Lizard Elder as seen recently in the LCS)

[](/graves) **Graves** - *BT, IE*

[](/kogmaw) **Kog'Maw** - *BotRK, LW* (Note that *LW* is last and the two on-hit items are first. Kog' Maw's W allows him to itemize for more attack-speed oriented items first, but BotRK also gives him an additional slow, which shores up his weakness of not having an escape)

[](/missfortune) **Miss Fortune** - *BT, IE* (Miss Fortune is also a prime candidate for building Black Cleaver, because her R is incredibly effective at applying the armor shred to an entire enemy team)

[](/quinn) **Quinn** - *BotRK, LW* (Strange champion, slight order variation. LW would be purchased fourth due to kit weakness and a longer build-up time on damage)

[](/sivir) **Sivir** - *BT, IE*

[](/tristana) **Tristana** - *BotRK, LW* (*BotRK* first is ideal, but the last 2 items should be purchased according to the enemy's items. Higher armor would warrant *LW* as 3rd item)

[](/twitch) **Twitch** - *BotRK, Shiv* or *PD* (Twitch's R stacks and restacks the *Shiv* quickly but it is also an auto attack modifier that crits for monstrously high numbers)

[](/varus) **Varus** - *BT, IE* (Varus is also free to build *BotRK*, because of the % damage on-hit on his W; The % current health damage from BotRK drops the enemy low, while the % total damage from proccing W drops the enemy dead)

[](/vayne) **Vayne** -* BT, IE* (Vayne's W is very similar to that of Varus, so rushing BotRK is great option on her as well)

1347899116.0,10113i,A Guide to Early Ranked Play - Part 1,Fenrils,122,19,23,"Hello everyone.  I am Fenrils (ign F3nr1s) and I am here to help you all out with ranked play.  I am by no means a pro player but I do feel I can give plenty of insight to players just starting out ranked play or those that wish to increase their own skill at this game.  This guide is part one to what will hopefully be a series of guides (if everyone likes it and wants more).  Why should you listen to me and at least try out some of my advice?  I have been playing League of Legends since the end of closed beta a few years ago, many custom matches such as ARAM

Let's get started then shall we?  This post, if you are under 1200 elo at the moment I would suggest you keep reading as you may learn something along the way. 

As a newly level 30 summoner, but rather take an inventory of what exactly you will need for truly effective ranked play.  First and foremost, you need to have two roles you are comfortable playing and at least three champions in those roles are are confident you can perform well with.  The interesting thing about ranked is that to get up to the middle tier (1600+) you are best off having a specialty you are very good with.  At that point you should become more of a generalist that can carry from a few more different roles until you hit high elo (1950+) at which point you become more of a specialist once more.

All that said, more than the others.  Look at those and find the continuity between them.  Are they mostly AD carries? Junglers? Are you the rare support player?  Find your niche, then look at a backup role you can do somewhat well with.  This is a point that I see so many players screwing up.  People look at the pros and the supposed “champion tiers” and make their choices off of that.  This is possibly the worst thing you could do to your stats.  Play what you love and are most comfortable with.  You will do much better and increase your elo much faster and more consistently playing champions you are inherently good with rather than the ones everyone else says is “the best.”  I have had my sorry butt carried through many games by the talented Viktor, Akali, and Tryndamere players.  All of them are in theory sub-par champions but their players were good, practiced, and took advantage of that.  

After this decision, and lolpro.com all have an assortment of guides that are written by the pros or just very talented players.  Read them and take in the information they give as it is more often than not better advice than what you would get on forums or reddit.  Despite that, take their advice with a grain of salt.  Runes and masteries can typically be copied 100% but the item builds are where we may make a few changes.  The item builds they recommend assume you can farm like a pro (100+ cs per 10 mins plus gold from kills.)  What this means is that they are not necessarily the optimal build for your skill level.  You may need to take some mid games items they ignore or change the item progression to fit your style and farm capabilities.  

If you know your roles, your elo will not show up on your profile until these ten matches are completed.  Do not be surprised if you lose or gain 40-50 elo per match for these first ten.  The game is attempting to determine where your true elo is at that time.  This is where psychology ruins potentially very good players.  Many people will see a few early losses and see their rating tank.  At that point they give up trying their best or even ranked play altogether.  Don't ever do this.  Ignore your rating.  It is just a number and it can always change.  I cannot emphasize this idea enough.  Just because you are sitting at an elo you do not like does not mean you are stuck there forever.  Keep trying and keep playing.  If you lose a few games in a row then the best thing you can do is to take a break.  Watch a TV show, go for a walk, grab some food, do something else.  You will regret it the next day if you keep playing because you will most likely lose more and thus decrease your elo even more.  Your mind says you will lose so you will subconsciously play at a lower level in order to prove yourself correct.  

The last addition to your mindset that you should remember is how to interact with other players.  If people rage, or anything then just ignore them.  The worst thing you could possibly do is retaliate.  Use your mute button liberally and silently.  Don't tell them you are muting or reporting them, just do it.  Don't ever outright blame your teammates.  More often than not this just creates turmoil in the team and will slowly but surely depreciate your chances of winning.  How many games have you won with your team yelling at each other?  Not very many I bet.  Instead, look at your own play.  Analyze what went wrong and how it could have been fixed.  Look back at all the mistakes you made and see how you could have improved a situation and possibly won a lane or a game.  I am a firm believer that 99% of all games played can be won by either team at any time if they just get their shit together, play to perfection, and exploit their opponents.  But now I am getting into the next part of this series which will be lane dominance, catching up

If you guys would like me to continue this sort of thing, mention that as well so I have a bit of motivation to go on.",[GUIDE],False,self,t5_2t9x3,guide,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/10113i/a_guide_to_early_ranked_play_part_1/
1342533955.0,wp9af,For those who want to get better at support: Here is what goes through my head when i'm playing.,crunchyCal,116,12,20,"playing support in ranked is infurating if your AD cant last hit well. I LOVE playing support

Therefore

depending on how strong/weak your AD is early game (ashe vs graves, i'll know to pick a hero that can PROACTIVELY deter them from going incredibly aggressive on my ADC.

what do i mean by proactively? i mean someone who is able to pressure by auto attacking and forcing their ADC to react

get good at zoning. get good at knowing when to control brush and knowing when to control river side. (when their support is in the bushes, your FORCING them to actively choose between CS'ING and COUNTER HARASSiNG.)

Know when to be aggressive and when to play passive. Do they have an enemy jungler that has a strong level 2 gank? how about level 4? does he start red?

Do micro calculations about trades- can you win a trade? How low is the enemy supports mana? Can we force potions on their AD? Can we force the enemy AD to waste mana? Do they have enough for a burst?

See that alistar? he's going to want to stalk the bushes and wait for a chance to headbutt pulverize so his lanemate can get off free harass. How can i actively stop him?

First off there are two important keys here: Alistar has sustain

Alistar likes bushes

What can we do? Start 1 sight ward and 1 pink ward. Ask your AD to last hit well

Sight ward the FAR bush and auto attack alitar if he gets within range. If he wards the CLOSE bush, he can't kill you.

Once we've established dominance over alistar

are my bushes warded? check. 
Is the enemy jungle not going to be near bot anytime soon? Check.
it's time to be aggressive. Where do we choose to be aggressive from? the RIVER side of the lane. Why? Less walls, our sight wards allows us to tell if alistar is moving in for a kill, and we can back off.

What should our AD be doing this whole time? farming and following up on any potential aggression.

So the solution to an alistar lane would be picking someone like soraka, lux, morgana. 

Leona is very similar to alistar, leona has no sustain and has to go ""all in"" in order to do so. You can zone her the same way you zone alistar. They key to negating aggression is to be aggressive yourself. Make use of river side to harass their ADC and stay out of range of the bush aggression. 


What about facing soraka? or janna? or lux?
Soraka lanes are inheretly boring. However, or three of them don't hurt. but 10? 20? it adds up.

so how do we counter pick this? Well we know that soraka has nothing other than silence and auto attack harass, leading us to make one decision.

Focus the enemy ADC

What do i mean make him screw up? 
if i'm playing a melee with a combo (taric, i can always fake aggression.

Fake aggression: the act of running towards the enemy ADC threatening to stun or otherwise damage when the enemy ADC is going for a last hit. They have to make a split second decision whether to risk taking a chunk of damage from my combo or getting that one cs.

the most vulnerable time to harass and be aggressive is after the armor buff from sorakas heal wears off. Remember

How about janna? the QUEEN of support?

i hate playing against janna, her shield allows you to negate a LOT of harass. her W is one of the best harassing tools in the game (W-auto auto auto) and her passive is OP. As a hero, she has such a huge skill cap potential.

Some janna tricks: use your q-q instantly, and shield to win trades. use your Q when the enemy goes aggressive onto you or your lane mate, and use it when your going aggressive. The hitbox on Q is HUGE, so you can always angle it to hit someone who is running away.

your R is one of the best disengages in the game- don't be afraid to use it. Also

playing against her: The best way to beat a janna is to force her to waste mana. What does this mean? Pick someone with sustain (sona, soraka, nunu) and actively try to win trades not in HP, but in terms of mana. A OOM janna is a janna that isn't scarry. So what can we do as a support?

Tell your ADC to be aggressive when you are

when janna W's you

the biggest problem is janna harass- it's so good. however, then your doing it right. 



Every little action as support bot lane has a purpose- i run towards the bush to force the enemy support backwards so they can't threaten my ADC. i run to river side and threaten to go aggressive on their ADC so they have to be careful or eat a chunk. I stand in front of my ADC in order to eat skillshots from ezreal

every action as a support should have a defined purpose. If you have a good AD, then don't feel bad about taking farm that they would otherwise miss- your impact on teamfights will be much larger than theirs. Know where to ward and when. Know jungle routes, long routes, and when the opponent can lane-gank. keep an eye on the minimap for your teammates who might otherwise not know these things.

*****

Hey guys! I have over a thousand ARAM games under my belt and have been meaning to write an ARAM guide for some time. With today's release of Howling Abyss I don't think there will be a better time than today. 

ARAM is a pretty simple game compared to Summoner's Rift. However, the gameplay in ARAM is different yet people often play the same. In response to this observation I decided to write this small guide.

*****

**Sustain

Probably the biggest difference between summoners rift and ARAM is that you cannot go back to the fountain to buy or heal. This has a major impact on the game. Here are some tips based on this difference.

*Trade efficiently*:

One of the biggest mistakes I see is high health champions diving in to get a kill on a low health champion. On SR this makes a lot of sense. If you can get a kill and survive

ARAM is best thought of as a battle of attrition. You should be aiming to whittle down your opponents health as much as possible. Since they can't regenerate at the fountain

You should never dive or take turret shots unless it means cleaning up the last couple enemies so you can take their turret down faster. 

Remember

*Buy sustain items*

Mana regen and health regen are two of the most important items in ARAM. Since this is a battle of attrition

Chalice is a core item on many champs. You want to be able to spam your abilities. It's not like SR where you might use your abilities only to farm or harass, the MR chalice gives you is great since bursty AP champs excel in ARAM. 

*****

**Itemization**

Itemizing in ARAM is a bit different than SR. Aura items are king

* Legion/Bulwark: It goes without saying that every team should have one person carrying a bulwark. Unfortunately

* Locket: Rarely do I see people picking up this item, especially if their team has some AD. The best thing about this is that multiple people on your team can have it. The reason no one gets this is that people simply look at champ guides or recommended items. 

* WOTA: Another excellent item I rarely see people getting because it's not in most SR guides or recommended items. It gives the equivalent to a Hextech Revolver to everyone on your team. The only reason this isn't higher is because sometimes your team comp will have a lot of AD

* Frozen Heart: Probably the best anti ADC item in the game

* Abyssal: Another fantastic item. It's not a standard item on any champ like most of the above items, and Rammus (Rammus should focus on Mpen and tankiness in ARAM). If the enemy has two or more mages it might be worth getting this faster for the MR. 

* Randuin's Omen: I count this is an aura item because of the activation's effect. However, but there are better options. I will get this if I am a tanky champ against a team with 2 or more AD.   

* Zeke's Herald: The purpose of this item is great

*""Support""* champs:

Most guides and recommended items on support champs are based on them having little gold. This isn't the case in ARAM. Sona and Soraka are two of the best ARAM champs but I often

*Itemize based on the enemy*: This almost goes without saying. Often on ARAM you'll go up against an all AP or AD team. Build the appropriate resistance and you will win. 

*****

**Base your strategy around the enemies team comp**

Another big problem I see is people playing passively against poke comps or sustain teams. In both of these situations you should be going all-in every time. I've won several games against teams filled with Nidd

If the enemy team has a lot of sustain with someone like Nidd or Soraka

If the enemy has a lot of poke champs it's also important to go all-in most of the time. You have to think

Another important thing is to communicate with your team. If you have a high value ult like Amu or Fidd tell them when it's off CD. Let them when you are going to engage. If they have a sustain comp

* DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR OPPONENT *

You're reading this like

So now you say, instincts, rehearsal, and general gameplay knowledge like ADC. What up and comers need to do is practice dominant strategies and STICK to them.

You are playing against a bronze 2 and you're gold 3. You think: oh I can just walk into lane and shit on the guy. So what happens? You naturally start developing bad habits that stick to you. EVEN if you dominate

What should be the staple gameplay strategy is play against the enemy ADC as if he was a HIGHER elo than you. You never face check, etc. ALL of these things will set you up for future failure and bad habits.

There are dominant strategies for ANY given situation where you might be potentially behind.  EX: Your support based

You always play the dominant strategy. Never set yourself up for bad habits and failure. You always play smart regardless of the enemies level. This will get you places and sets you up for future AND immediate success rather than JUST immediate success.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The Nine Tailed Fox*

#*This is a guide on how to play Ahri in Mid Lane*

Ahri is an incredibly powerful snowballing mage that is capable of fighting 1v2s and coming out on top due to her high mobility from *Spirit Rush*. Her lvl 3 full combo will most definitely push any squishy enemy Mid Laner out of lane if not killing him/her. Upon hitting lvl 6, and even her survivability skyrocket for you're now have an access to technically Three Flashes thanks to her ult, which, once mastered, can allow for some absolutely amazing plays. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Abilities**

 * **Passive:** *Essence Theft* 

&gt; Ahri gains a charge of Essence Theft whenever one of her spells hits an enemy, and she gains 35% Spell Vamp for the her next spell. (All charges are expended when she uses a spell at 9 charges).

Built in sustain for Ahri, if he/she's smart, he/she will trade with you, by the end of the trade you should have 9 charges on your passive allowing you to either Q an entire minion wave as it approaches the lane in a straight line, or if that's not available, quickly using Q over the wall to hit your Wraith camp or the enemy's will suffice. Makes it hard for the enemy laner to push Ahri out of lane, during the early stages of the game, since W does more overall single target damage (plus 50% if additional fox-fires hit the same target)

 * **Q Ability:** *Orb of Deception* // Range: 880 // Cooldown: 7 / 7 / 7 / 7 / 7 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri sends her orb outward and then pulls it back

&gt; Costs: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 33% Bonus AP)

&gt; True Damage:  40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 33% Bonus AP)

A very strong ability that is able to hit enemy champions who are hiding behind they're minion waves. The best way to maximize the amount of damage dealt by this ability, being a skill shot, remember that it's range is gonna a bit longer than indicated (880 units), and use it at max range to get both of the Magic and True DMG procs off, without much room for your enemy to dodge either the Orb going out or coming back in. It also curves to the way you're moving, so if you'd like to reposition yourself to allow the True damage part to hit someone else, you can either ult in that direction, or just simply walk in that direction. 

 * **W Ability:** *Fox Fire* // Range: 800 // Cooldown: 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri releases three fox fires that lock-on to nearby enemies

&gt; Costs: 60 / 60 / 60 / 60 / 60 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 40 / 65 / 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 40% Bonus AP)

Use this ability to essentially duel with any melee that happens to get within range of your W as all 3 fox fires pack a big punch during early game. Remember that the 800 unit ranges overlap one another, since the Mana cost on W is significantly cheaper than Q and E. 

 * **E Ability:** *Charm* // Range: 975 // 12 / 12 / 12 / 12 / 12 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri blows a kiss towards an enemy dealing Magic damage and charms him/her

&gt; Costs: 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+ 35% Bonus AP)

&gt; Charm Duration: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 second(s)

An amazing ability that can be a massive help when forcing objectives like Dragon, as if can make an enemy squishy walk out of position in which you and the rest of your team engage on him/her. The best way to learn how to hit it is, just like Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab, or Thresh's Death Sentence, hit it at odd angles to surprise the enemy. Also, learn it's maximum range, being a skill shot, and use it at max range. 

**Tip:** Till Riot fixes this, hit Dragon with your E and it'll reset it momentarily allowing it to regain 200-300 Health, effectively stalling. 

* **R Ultimate** *Spirit Rush* // Range: 450 // Cooldown: 110 / 95 / 80 second(s)

&gt; Active: Ahri dashes forth

&gt; Costs: 100 / 100 / 100 Mana

&gt; Magic Damage: 85 / 125 / 165 (+ 35% Bonus AP) (Single Essence Bolt)

&gt; Magic Damage: 255 / 375 / 495 (+ 35% Bonus AP x 3) (Total DMG From 3 Essence Bolts)

Ahri's most iconic ability, you should be surviving more sticky situations since this Ultimate is a saving grace I you happen to do something silly and get caught out of position. Use it for repositioning yourself if you're caught somewhere in the front line for some reason, use it to dodge important skillshots, i.e. Lux's Finales Funkein or Ezreal's Trueshot Barrage, use it to get to the enemy back line to melt the squishies, or use it to dance around the enemy team dealing AoE DMG with your Q + W + R. Remember that there is a 0.5 second lapse between each use of R. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Skill Order**

In almost all games you'll be maxing Q first, while also putting points in R whenever possible.

**Starting Ability**

At most games in the very beginning, i.e. repelling invades, invading, surprise lvl 1 ganks, or just regular laning.

Start with Q if you're wishing to either:

 * Safely farm in lane without any chance of being harassed. (Be careful to not push the lane with your Q since it is an AoE)

 * Safely harass in lane without any chance of being harassed back. 

 * If you're invading, if able and caught. 

Start with W if you're wishing to either:

 * If you're gonna be up-close-and-personal with your enemy laner early on and wish to trade well with him/her at Lvl 1 (Ideally champions who get his/her gap closer at Lvl 1, etc.)

Start with E if you're wishing to either:

 * If you're the only person with hard CC on your team and you're team is invading the enemy jungle. 

 * If you know you're able to out harass an enemy laner with 1 E
 
Remember that your Lvl 3 full combo does insane amounts of damage early on, once you hit Lvl 6, especially right underneath the enemy's tower. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Runes** 

My 2 personal set(s) specific to Ahri are:

**Set #1**
Name: MS w/ ManaReg

&gt;3x Quintessences of Movement Speed

&gt;9x Marks of Magic Penetration

&gt;9x Seals of Mana Regeneration

&gt;9x Glyphs of Flat Ability Power

Reasoning: This set allows Ahri to dodge skillshots without being totally reliant on her Ultimate, i.e. to farm, farm, and farm. Specifically this is for champions that directly counter me to the point that I can't do much but farm, e.g. champions like Morgana, due to Black Shield CC Null and Soul Shackle, Katarina due to Shunpo-ing away from skillshots, etc.

**Set #2**
Name: MS w/ Def vs. AD/AP

&gt;3x Quintessences of Movement Speed / Quintessences of Flat Ability Power

&gt;9x Marks of Magic Penetration 

&gt;9x Seals of Flat Armour

&gt;9x Glyphs of Scaling Magic Resist

Reasoning: Obvious reason being to survive with Resistances against champions who can get up and personal against Ahri, etc., or are able to deal a large amount of burst damage in which your sustain can't match up to, i.e. Lux full combo, Katarina full combo, etc. Quintessences of Movement Speed can be replaced with Quintessences of Flat Ability Power if you prefer to have more DMG early on for counter-harass, I just prefer MS since Ahri's Base MS is ridiculously slow (305).
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Masteries**

&gt;21/0/9

Standard AP Mid masteries if you want to maximize your DMG potential, and as well as making your AAs hit harder due to the Spellsword mastery. 

&gt;9/21/0

Needed if you believe your Rune Page won't be enough to allow you to survive the early game and as well as if you believe you'll be ganked a lot pre-6. Added survivability is always nice

&gt;9/0/21

Only to be taken if having the additional 6% CDR early game and that fact that having a Lvl 6 Ult advantage will put you ahead against those champions that are not much without his/her ult, Nidalee, etc., I'd recommend this for experienced Ahri players, but is still worth a try if you're confident in your DMG potential, skill with skillshots and ganking potential. Is meant to be also taken if you're against enemy laners that tend to roam a lot, i.e. Twisted Fate, Nidalee
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Builds**

**Important Reminder:** These builds are to NOT be followed religiously! Build accordingly
Your team mainly Magic DMG? Build an Abyssal Scepter. Your teams wants your sole job to be to kill the enemy ADC with one burst combo? Get a Deathfire's Grasp. Loosing your lane? Remember that defensive stats always beat out offensive stats. 

**Core Items:**
 
 * *Sorcerer Shoes* [](/sorcerersshoes) - More Magic Penetration is always nice, for bonus MS, or Homeguard for getting back to Mid Lane much quicker.

 * *Morellonomicon* [](/morellonomicon) - I know what you may be thinking, this item has to be the single most cost efficient item, for the stats that it gives, in the game! Ahri is a type of champion who doesn't need excessively heavy AP items to deal ""Tons of Damage,"" but that doesn't mean she doesn't need them. It's an amazing first item to complete due to it's absurd cheapness, meaning that you may have a definite item advantage on your enemy laner, e.g. you have one completed ""big ticket item"" vs the enemy laner's one Needlessly Large Rod. It most cases, you'll have it completed during the middle of Laning Phase, as an Assassin, but it all boils down to the fact that you'd have to try it out yourself. 

 * *Rabadon's Deathcap* [](/rabadonsdeathcap) - A very very solid item for Ahri. More AP for more burst
_______________________________________________________________________________________
**Why DFG Is Rushed Rather Than Deathcap

Assuming:

&gt;Glass cannon runepage

&gt;21-0-9 masteries 

&gt;Level 7

&gt;Base AP = [(4.95 * 3) + (0.17 * 9 * 7) + 6 + 7] * 1.05 = 40

&gt;Target has 50 MR

&gt;You land all skillshots

&gt;One full rotation only

&gt;Sorc shoes are accounted for in all calculations


 * Why level 7? Because that's roughly when you should be finishing your first big item. Of course

 * Why 50 MR? It's a simple

DFG:

&gt;Total Cost: 4200

&gt;Total AP: (39 + 120) * 1.05 = 167

&gt;Orb of Deception = 115 + (0.33 * 167) = 170 magic damage + 170 true damage

&gt;Fox-Fire = 80 * (0.8 * 167) = 214 magic damage

&gt;Charm = 60 + (0.35 * 167) = 118 magic damage

&gt;Spirit Rush = 255 + (1.05 * 167) = 430 magic damage

&gt;Total Damage Before MR Mitigation = [(170 + 214 + 118 + 430) * 1.2] + 170 = 1118 magic damage + 170 true damage + 15% of target's current health

&gt;Total MR = 50 * 0.92 - 7.8 - 15 = 23.2

 * Total Damage After MR Mitigation = 0.81 * (1118 + 15% of target's current health) + 170 = 907 magic damage + 170 true damage + 12% of target's current health

Deathcap: 

&gt;Total Cost: 4400

&gt;Total AP: (39 + 120) * 1.35 = 215

&gt;Orb of Deception = 115 + (0.33 * 215) = 186 magic damage + 186 true damage

&gt;Fox-Fire = 80 * (0.8 * 215) = 252 magic damage

&gt;Charm = 60 + (0.35 * 215) = 135 magic damage

&gt;Spirit Rush = 255 + (1.05 * 215) = 481 magic damage

&gt;Total Damage Before MR Mitigation = (186 + 252 + 135 + 481) + 186 = 1054 magic damage + 186 true damage

&gt;Total MR = 50 * 0.92 - 7.8 - 15 = 23.2

 * Total Damage After MR Mitigation = 0.81 * 1054 = 856 magic damage + 186 true damage

As you can see, the results vary when you start to factor in CDR and other items, but even then, DFG is powerful all around. For other builds, Deathcap deals consistently more damage than when DFG's active is down (not counting CDR).

### **Early Game**

 1. Do the usual as you've seen it a thousand times and done it a thousand times before. Don't put in any points in any abilities right off the bat, Q if normal. 
 
 2. Use 1 of your wards to ward the enemy Wraith camp. (Why? So you can keep up with where the enemy Jungler is

 3. Help your jungler do Blue/Red Buff through either a Q or some AAs

 4. While that goes on you and your Top Lane do Wolves or Wraiths

 5. Afterwards

**Important Reminder:** During the most early parts of the game, when playing as Ahri, it's extremely hard to make a comeback if you fall behind, i.e. if you die more than 3x before Laning Phase is over, so be careful when trading or going ""all-in"" if you have any hint that you may die during the process.

**Playstyle**

As Ahri, farming and disengaging with E, or an aggressive play-style, harassing with Qs + Ws. 

 * My personal playstyle with her involves a mixture of both, and then only going in for a full combo when I see an available opportunity, e.g. enemy laner goes to ward brush, I stop farming and get in the best position to hit the enemy with my E and proceed with a full combo. 

 * If you find an opportunity to gank, Ahri performs ganks well with just her normal kit, relying on hitting a Charm is crucial though. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________

### **Mid Game**

The time of Mid Game is generally characterized by the idea that one or two towers are down, but are instead grouping up for larger teamfights. 

During this time is when Ahri shines for this is when enemy champions are just beginning to consider building MR, try to prolong teamfights, and go farm for it. (Your kit allows you to be very slippery so solo farming w/o vision isn't too bad, but map awareness should still be taken into account of.) 

**Charm's Importance**

Ahri's kit is perfect for forcing teamfights, that your team can take advantage of, although be careful to not overextend yourself for you can be insta-gibbed really quickly. 

Your burst at this time is tremendous, if not actually get the kill, do so! Take advantage of the various mistakes that your enemies will make! 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### **Late Game**

This is a pretty difficult part of playing Ahri since she tends to fall off around 35-40 minutes

But if it so happens that the game lasts longer than 35-40 minutes, your ult may no longer do much damage overall, so you may just save it just for repositioning yourself if you get caught in bad positions during teamfights. You can clean up fights really well during late game, so learn to stay in the back and just spam Q's, until the right opportunity arrives. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
### Tips &amp; Tricks

 * If you need the True damage part of your Orb of Deception to hit much sooner, to your opponent to have the Orb return to you sooner. 

 * Aggravate your enemies by Charming neutral camps and reseting them

 * When in a 1v1 vs. another champion with skillshots, and you have good timing, you can maximize your juking potential of his/her's skillshots but Ulting through them so that you're behind them, also sets you up for your full combo.

 * Try to space out your 3 uses of Spirit Rush

 * Your Ult's dash range is a little shorter than an actual Flash so be wary when trying to Ult through thicker walls like those in Mid Lane. 

 * Learn Ahri's Damage Potential with items and without

 * During early game

 * I'd recommend last hitting with only your AAs and E Charm so that you don't push the lane.

 * Learn to hit AAs in between your 3 Ults as it will maximize your DMG especially during the early stages of the game when you just hit Lvl 6.

1370815975.0,1g07xn,"To my fellow bronze players: ""WTF, you didn't ban XXXXX? GG nubs"", or a guide to beating the ""OP champs"".",abchiptop,124,88, and am slowly climbing up from bronze v.

I all too often see a team give up mentally when the enemy team gets Amumu, and I can tell you they're not worth throwing a game over! 

Shen. The ultimate split pusher. He can build almost nothing but health and defenses, shielding an ally and changing a 4v4 into a 4v5. So how do you deal?

% health is a fantastic counter. He's gonna build a lot of it, and bust through the shield. If you kill them before he teleports, his ult goes on cooldown. Alternatively, if you know you can't burst that quickly, disengage. Turn around and run. You will piss him off by wasting his ult, then it's down for a while on CD. Sure you didn't get the kill, but his presence is lessened now

He's tanky, MR will reduce damage greatly. Buy some.

Amumu, all while being tanky. OR, he will go AP, burst like hell, and melt in an instant.

The problem with Amumu is bronze is that nobody knows how to use him, which lead me to look into why. The biggest reason? People didn't look at how to build *or* play him. You want to go AP tank. You want an hourglass, a bulwark and a Deathcap and merc treads. You'll be fairly tanky, but loaded with burst. A little secret: he's great for a surprise offensive flash into ult, then Q as they run away so you have a chase tool. Save that bandage.

So how do you play against him? Banshee's Veil. Single handedly the best item to counter him, Amumu has one major weakness (outside of his mana consumption), and that is that he can be kited indefinitely if you can dodge his bandage toss. He has no gap closer, no ranged poke. He can pull himself into your team and ult, that's about it. So when you see that coming, get your own stun ready, and stun his ass before he lands

Blitzcrank. Fucking Beep Boop. Often banned because I don't want my support playing him, and it's hard for us low ELO players to hit. Keep vision on him and watch the animation, when his arm raises, move behind a minion or to the side. If you lose sight, you get grabbed (happened to me over a wall today).

Malphite is my least experience, first pick usually grabs them. Play Anivia, Trundle or J4. What you want to do is get a champ that can separate Malph from his team. You see him ult in? Hello Anivia wall. He is now stranded for roughly 3 seconds after CC wears off while you nuke him, unless the enemy team burned flash. Trundle can drop a pillar, and J4 can either sacrifice ult onto the enemy team or right where you stand to lock them out and pummel Malph. Warn your team if you try that last one. 

The best part about your enemy team getting these: unless they play a lot of blind pick

The most important thing is to get game knowledge. Play these champs in a custom game,,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,True
1371464694.0,1giaw1,A few months ago I posted about a 6-month climb to diamond. Here's my progress and what I've learned,Rawnix,113,18,98,"So about 2 months ago I posted a thread on reddit about a 6-month climb to diamond. I started at Bronze III

http://imgur.com/hrQ2fSD

I'm making this thread to explain some things I've learned along the way:

1) Be aggressive-

Early game aggression is amazing when you know how to play it right. I dont mean level 1 dive aggressive, your jungler will be free to counterjungle and countergank.

2) Dying's almost never ""worth""

This is probably the most important one. Dying for a drake is definitely worth it

3) Insta-mute anyone who you even think is going to flame.

Simple

4) You have to be a leader

Insert yourself as a dominant presence in the game. Communicate, gank mid, then call for drake. Running teleport really helped with this because I could just TP right back to top lane when drake was done (or B, as I'd usually have at least 1k after that)

5) Dont blindly follow builds

When you look up a guide, but learning how to build to your current situation will drastically improve your game.

6) Dont blindly follow counterpicks

This goes back to 5. Why does Mordekaiser counter Diana? Why would Renekton be good against Jax? Why would you pick Fiddle vs Vlad? Knowing the reason behind the counterpick is far more important than playing a champion you arent comfortable with. For example: I know that Fizz counters Lux. However I don't play Fizz. But why does Fizz counter Lux? Simple, I play Katarina. Kat can all-in almost as well as Fizz can and I'm comfortable with her.

7) Timerstimerstimers

Time blue. Time red. Time drake. Time golems. TIME EVERYTHING. This allows for you to set up sneaky drakes, then you know they'll try again some time around 26:16. You can be sure to have wards and your team in the area so you can intercept their drake attempt.

8) Stop raging

I still havent mastered this one

9) The game isnt over until the nexus explodes.

I actually press yes in about 1/20 surrenders. A game is always winnable, and encourage your teammates when morale is low. Dont surrender unless it's plain and clear you're wasting time.

10) You aren't the center of the universe

I used to get mad when I lost lane. I'd blame my Jungler ""XIN YOU HAVENT GANKED ENOUGH"". Then I'd realize he was 10-1-4 at 15 minutes and still get angry, do your part to help them carry your sorry ass. You aren't the center of attention, and you wont always win lane. Get comfortable with coming from behind, because you will be doing a lot of it when up against people of equal skill level.

11) You shouldn't be Diamond I. You'd be there already otherwise.

The skill gap from Bronze III to Silver IV is so huge I cant begin to describe it. It's massive. Don't overcredit yourself

12) Set realistic CS Goals

150 by 20 minutes. Any lane. Above that and you're doing great.

13) Communicate !@#%@#%@#$!~#%!

Seriously, banning Janna is always a good idea. If you want a poke comp, ban heavy initiators like Malphite, Hecarim, and Amumu. Splitpush comp? Remove TF and Shen if you arent playing them. Stuff like this will help your team a dramatic amount.

14) Be adaptable

This has a double meaning. The first meaning is that you should be able to play any role. By play

The second meaning is that you should be able to form your strategies around your current situation. This involves counterbuilding and changing up your ideas. Example: You went for a ""Protect the Kog"" comp

15) Dont mindlessly queue

Zombie mode = no no. If you're not giving the game your full attention

16) Test your ping

I do this with a quick warmup game of Dominion before I play any normals or ranked. Sometimes my ping gets pretty high

* It's after min 30
* Regi's Kassadin shows up at Bottom
* DIG starts Baron
* Suddenly Wildturtles Graves gets caught badly. TSM gets anhilated.
* Regi Blamed.

**My Analysis**
Okey

* Creating a huge wave bottom -&gt; map pressure/towers threw minions
* baiting DIG into doing baron.
* carefully getting some damage off by contesting with 4.
* Kassadin arrives late
* Kassadin is a mobile Assasin who gets more damge per jump. There fore him traveling far and entering a fight late would allow him to burst atleast 1 of DIG instantly.
* If DIG collapsed onto the 4 they'd have taken Baron damage can couldve gotten kited.
* If DIG stayed on baron they'd have lost bot and would most likely have been aced out.
* if the 4 man wouldve not been able to put pressure on DIG. TSM couldve just backed out and gotten bottom threw minions while pressuring a baron-damaged DIG that wants to TP B.

Problem was that the Turtle did a misplay. I guess he wanted to Quickdraw over a wall and got stuck. The most iportant member of TSM fucking up in such a situation hurts. Espacially when they had such a great gameplan.

IMO it was a genius plan. It had mid risk

1373410762.0,1hyv64,"Aggressive split pushing, and why you should do it more",blanketninja,109,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1hyv64/aggressive_split_pushing_and_why_you_should_do_it/

**Why is splitting to take objectives so important?**

* In League, comes more potential opportunities to make plays and put high amounts of pressure on the enemy team.

* Towers give you control over that area of the map; a downed tower means no protection or vision on that area of the map anymore. You could be perfectly even with the enemy team in terms of gold, it is extremely difficult to play from that situation since they have a lot more control of the map and space to work with.

* A downed inhib loses **SO MUCH CONTROL** for whatever team loses it. Not only do super minions now naturally push that lane super hard, and if they mess up, will simply be pushed in from all sides.

* Most people subconsciously understand the impact of losing many towers and an inhib

So the tl;dr is that structures offer your team a huge amount of control, giving you more space to make plays and win the game.

**So why is split pushing as a strategy so effective in taking down structures and objectives?**

* Split pushing at it's core is extremely effective because it requires minmum coordination to set up, then you invested into splitting that lane. If they're constantly trying to stop your pushes, it prevents them from grouping up and making plays by forcing teamfights or Barons or pushing down a lane.

* If they slip up and make the mistake of grouping up and not stopping your push

* You as a single person can create a HUGE amount of pressure on the map not just by split pushing

* Split pushing the entire game allows you to gain levels and farm like no one else in the game. It'll put you at a HUGE item and level advantage, and just in general be able to put even more pressure on the map as the game goes on.

* Putting enemy teams under constant pressure **(ESPECIALLY IN SOLOQ / NORMAL GAMES)** means that they will constantly be making mistakes you can capitalize on. If they decide to send the wrong person back to stop you, you begin to recognize mistakes and begin to capitalize on them  to make your split push even more effective.

---

And one last point; I find split pushing to be extremely extremely fun. I know what you're thinking: how can it be fun to just sit in a lane and push it all day?

My answer to that is two-fold. One: I LOVE farming. Split pushing will guarantee you always end up with the most farm in the game. Once you actually join teamfights

The second answer is that I love to watch the enemy team fold and crumble as they try to deal with a split push. There's few things more satisfying than having people chase you around while your team takes towers and dragons and Barons. You can almost smell the desperation from the enemy team when multiple people chase you for over an entire minute. Especially in soloq

--

tl;dr split pushing is fun, so you should be doing it more and getting your free wins.

Any comments, etc would be appreciated as I always love to hear from other people about their perspective on split pushing.

For the past few weeks

* Laner (typically Top

* Laner takes their tower

* Laner leaves lane and goes roaming

So far, your obligation to your lane has not ended. For the most part, you've given a free-farming lane to your enemy to let them catch up, and your pressure that you exert in other lanes must be so dramatic as to pull them away from that lane. 

By allowing your previously beaten lane-opponent to farm while you are ""making plays"" across the map

What I'm going to say here may be a shock to some

**You lost your lane.**

You did not need, no arguing against it. Maybe mid was really getting camped hard and you were needed there? That's great that you have the freedom with a tower down to roam down there, but get there, do what you need to do, and get out before you force the game into the teamfight phase.

By not keeping your lane specifically pushed up, and this often forces 4v5's in the lane phase. You may think ""well leave it and team fight"" but how about no one engages, we save the tower, *and then* team fight at full strength, knowing that time is on our side and it's just a matter of time before the minions in that wave force the enemy to deal with them. 

So, but if they send 4 players up to just deal with you, that's worth your team being able to have 3-4 in another lane and pushing it, forcing at least an even trade (often they can push a lane with a tower already down, netting you free access to an inhibitor tower).

Think of your minions as your advance party, minions provide significant vision that the average person doesn't appear to appreciate, and by not keeping waves pushed up it can be downright impossible for anyone to go out warding. You may say ""WARD FFS"" but at the same time, the warding players are in a position where to do so is borderline suicidal, as if minions were at least pushed to the river they can maneuver based around sightings of the enemy and successfully ward.

This is getting lengthy, and while lane clearing can be a shared responsibility in the team fight phase, everyone should be aware of the drastic benefits keeping your lane farmed up and free of enemy minions confers.

1368620314.0,1edmme,Tips for having an impact on the game as support,LMeadows93,109,13,43,"Hello, such as decision making and pressure on the map. All positions can do this

In this post, and more importantly, why did you lose after winning your lane?

* **Pressure**
Pressure in LoL comes in many different ways. For support, If you have a ward on enemy blue, and you see two champions taking that buff down, you know a 4 man push at top is going to generate a lot of pressure on the enemy team, forcing them to be co-ordinated and either stop your push as a team, or quickly counter-push to trade objectives for whatever you take from them. Forcing solo queue teams to make split second decisions is how mistakes are made, at any level of play.

* **Decision making**
Based on vision, then quickly take a free dragon, there is no way they can contest as you outnumber them and have the jungler's smite present. A good support can read the dynamics of the game and understands what objective can be taken next.

* **Objectives**
The most important topic in a game of LoL. Objectives win games. And it is the supports job to recognise which objectives can be taken next. Objectives can be listed into a list of importance with inhibitors and baron being situational, neutral buffs. Why do I consider an inhibitor and baron to be equal? Because they go hand-in-hand with the pressure they give on the next 5 minutes of the game. If you take an inhibitor is causes all lanes to push which can allow for further snowballing, taking more towers, buffs, dragons etc. If you take baron, the buff it brings also allows you to snowball and take more objectives. Which one to take first is entirely on decision making and reading the dynamics of the game. One thing to note is that it is important your team ALL do ONE objective together, rather than 2 going to take an inhibitor and 3 going to take baron. It is better to follow your team EVEN if you don't agree with the objective they are choosing to take.

Overall, a master tactician who can read the dynamics of the game to realise what objective is best to take next. Champions are simply pawns to help you take objectives, which means that you shouldn't chase down a pawn when you can take a king.

I hope these topics help people grasp the concept of vision

Always question your decisions. If you attempted baron and the enemy team came and aced you, 100% take it safely. The amount of throws done at baron is uncountable. Don't be greedy, do you even need baron? Not if you are 10 kills, 3 towers and inhibitor ahead. Keep pushing the other inhibitors on the map for safer and greater results.

1365193460.0,1br8b5,A whole ton of nifty Thresh gameplay tips.,TacticOgre,111,18,71,"Thresh is considered to be one of the strongest supports right now, here's a whole bunch of tips I have to share with the community of Summoner School:

**Death Sentence - Q**

* Taking Q at level 1 is pretty much always a must. It's useful in level 1 invasions

* Once you manage to land a hook on an enemy

* Due to the ability's long windup time, or even your ultimate. Any hook you toss out after that will be virtually impossible to miss, even if the enemy flashes away.

* This may be considered slightly wasteful, you probably weren't going to engage with that hook anyway.

* Unfortunately, you can drag pets like Malzahar's voidling or Elise's spiderlings (Which actually makes those champions difficult to grab themselves).

* If you're worried about your target getting away in a fight

* It can be easy to forget about the passive component of the skill while playing as support. Make use it often in lane, unless you're losing the lane by a ridiculous margin). I personally like AD or ~~armor penetration~~ magic penetration (the damage is actually magical even though it scales off of AD) marks on Thresh for this very reason, the Pickpocket mastery also compliments the skill nicely. While you're alone in lane, it also makes your last hitting a lot easier.

* Check the strength of your Q's passive by looking at its icon on the buff bar - the color changes depending on how much damage you've accumulated


**Dark Passage - W** 

* Arguably the best skill in Thresh's arsenal

* The most obvious use for the lantern is getting teammates out of sticky situations, and it's even possible to Teleport to it, which can be particularly useful while playing with someone you can voice chat with.

* One notoriously annoying problem with the lantern is that it's very difficult/impossible for your teammate to grab it while an enemy is standing on it. Always try to toss your lantern ahead of where your fleeing teammate is running

* The clickable circle around the lantern is actually a pretty decent size. Because of this, but it also comes into play in other occasions. Most notably, if you want to use it to save someone from a Jarvan IV ultimate, it's best to throw the lantern at the side of the arena, rather than the center of it.

* When using the lantern to collect souls, that way you may pick up a couple of extra souls you may have otherwise missed.

* You don't always have to use the lantern for escapes. Your teammates will greatly appreciate the mobility when you use it for hopping over walls to get around the jungle faster. What I often like to do is toss it into a jungle camp

* It's possible to see how much longer your lantern will stay on the ground - There's a small timer circle around it

* Once you leave the range of the lantern, walk out of its range in order to grab it, then walk up to your partner to make sure the shield doesn't go to waste.

* The lantern can be an exceptionally powerful enhancement for your jungler's ganks. You can toss it behind you for a from-lane gank, Hecarim and Vi. However, be aware that tossing your lantern backwards can telegraph the gank to your more attentive enemies.

* During all-in lategame teamfights or while doing Baron

**Flay - E**

* Due to its peculiar targeting scheme, I recommend maxing this ability last because the knockback is its main purpose.

* Because it displaces enemies, you can't move things like Heimerdinger turrets.

* Paired with Thresh's hook

* When initiating with Q + R, just save your Flay for until a better opportunity in the fight arises.

* (Honestly not much to say about this ability

**The Box - R**

* You'd be surprised how much damage this ability can deal even without any offensive items

* The obvious and most effective combo is to Amumu yourself into the enemy team with Death Sentence and The Box. However, the radius is deceptively small, which means you shouldn't hesitate and activate the ability immediately upon landing on the enemy team.

* Although you could get away with it with Amumu

* The Box is its most dangerous at junction spots in the jungle, or be confined by them.

* While it's best in teamfights and engagements, it's most effective in the jungle.

* Keep in mind that although it practically immobilizes enemies

**Tanking Fundamentals**
 
##The Importance of Tanking

You are the DMG sponge, a CC machine at times, and maybe even a KS machine as well. You're the reason why enemy teams quake in their boots at your awesome tankiness! I'd rank the importance of you, the Tank, as 3rd most important member on the 5 man team, right behind the AD and AP Carry, for you contribute so much to the team during teamfights and objectives. It's not as easy as one believes either

*Exempli Gratii:*

 * When and when-not to engage just cause you caught someone out of position for a teamfight, at the blink of your initiation. 

 * When and when-not to blindly stall, try not to make risky plays. 

##How to Tank: Key Concepts

You're the Tank

 * To initiate fights that are in favor for your team

 * To look like a massive threat

 * To peel for your important carries during fights

 * To stay alive during teamfights, Kha'Zix, etc., for cleaning up. Stay alive!  Don't be afraid to walk out of the middle of fights when you're low to stay alive, you've done your job. Besides, with you being alive, it could mean the difference between an Ace on the enemy team or a straggler getting away to be able to defend a lane push. 
 
##Who Can Tank

Usually, i.e. not including fighters that just stack HP, are rather minute, I'll just write about each champion that is a tank and explain how he/she works for the team.

**Important Request:** As most of you all know, etc., that I don't often play Jungle or Top, i.e. the Tank Role, but more Mid Lane AP Carry and Support Bot Lane Tank, meaning that some of my information may be wrong, somewhat off,** as a request from me

**Shen** [](/shen)

&gt; Mainly played in Top Lane and sometimes the Jungle, his E AoE Taunt allowing him to perform his job as the tank much easier, and ability to peel and discourage an enemy from attempting to kill an important allied carry. He's a strong laner via his kit, i.e. Magic DMG Q harass + W Shield +  E ability cancellation, in which allows him to win most match-ups and get ahead gold-wise for tanky items. He can splitpush well with a Sunfire Cape + his Passive, with a thanks to his Ultimate, allowing him to peel effectively for teamfights
 
**Malphite** [](/malphite)

&gt; Another Top Laner who can Jungle as well. Is able to perform well thanks to his innate tankiness from his Passive, Unstoppable Force, is an amazing initiation tool that can be utilized both offensively and defensively. 

**Sejuani** [](/sejuani)

&gt; Having the the highest win rate out of all champions as of now, that is an AoE DMG spell, that has hard CC, adds to her already insane versatility in her kit, making her one of the soon-to-be top tier Junglers, if not already. 

**Nautilus** [](/nautilus)

&gt; Being considered one of the top tier junglers who can also tank very well due to his Shield, thanks to both his Ult and his Q. 

**Rammus** [](/rammus)

&gt; Being one of the recommended champions listed under ""tank, due to his stupidly high resistances, and is where he is needed always due to his superior mobility. Very easy to pick up for tanking and jungling, yet requires a lot of skill to master, being that on timing of his E Taunt, Q timing, W timing, once he has acquired the HP stacking items he needs

**Alistar** [](/alistar)

&gt; Towering with massive amounts of innate tankiness thanks to his Ult, disengage, or even poke. Missing the old days of Jungle Alistar in early Season 2, he still is a strong jungler is able to make the plays needed to snowball his team ahead. 

**Singed** [](/singed)

&gt; Although being classified as ""Fighter

**Cho'Gath** [](/chogath)

&gt;  He is one of the harder Tanks to play, his Stacks are hard to keep up if the enemy team knows how to exploit Cho'Gath's early game weakness, i.e. his early game squishiness. He is, however, unkillable to once he attains the amount of HP and Stacks that he needs to Tank from getting ahead. 

**Amumu** [](/amumu)

&gt; Fairly weak early game, Amumu is limiteed to helping his team through purely catching out enemy champions or timing his ult appropriately, yet that may prove difficult if you're behind and lack the HP to tank fights long enough to time your Ults perfectly.

**Dr. Mundo** [](/mundo)

&gt; Being feared during most of Season 2 for his insane HP-stacking Tankiness, he can deal a considerable amount of DMG for a tank. 

**Trundle** [](/trundle)

&gt; *Lacking in credible information on Champion since rework

**Maokai** [](/maokai)

&gt; Being chosen as the Pro Player Pick by The Odd One, correct, of course, he's a professional, I'm not. Point being, Maokai is a very strong Jungle Tank who can take a large amount of punishment thanks to the DMG Reduction from his Ult. Although he's relatively squishy during the early stages of the game and timing on his abilities can be crucial. 

**Volibear** [](/volibear)

&gt; A very strong Tank who is a strong Initiator for his team. Innately tanky throughout the entirety of the game

**Hecarim** [](/hecarim)

&gt; The Tank Pony. A strong Tank who excels at being the Initiator in his team, ALSO while scaling as a pure Tank. 

**Thresh** [](/thresh)

&gt; *Lacking in information on Jungle/Tank Thresh NOT Support Thresh, if someone could kindly fill me in on Jungle/Tank Thresh, that would be very appreciated.*
  
##When To Peel

 * *Peeling* -  The act of completely removing any threat from the target champion/ally in which you are peeling for with your kit/abilities
 
It's actually slightly hard to determine when to peel and when to initiate yourself, and in League of Legends either can be the defining moment of a Victory or Defeat, so choose carefully and wisely. Ideally, you'll want to peel for an important carry if:

 * You have another champion on your team who is able to initiate either better or on-par with your abilitties

 * If the sole DMG source is a single carry in which you have to peel for

##When To Initiate

 * Generally, if:

  * If it's a 5v5 ""hover

   * Blows an important cooldown, etc.

   * If you have champion, Thresh, Nautilus, Leona, etc.

   * If you know you can win a straight fight due to your team having the superior composition

  * If it's an 5v4 or below for the enemy team, and everyone else is in Bot Lane or far away enough so that that enemy AP Carry can't make a contribution to the fight. 

  * **Important:** I'd recommend that you have excessively good map coverage, AD or AP Carry, out of position. Do not get yourself kill due to lack of ward coverage. Having good ward coverage can be the difference between securing an Ace for your team or having 2 or 3 stragglers get away to defend the base. 

  * ""Surprise Initiations"" out of FoW can be a devastating surprise for the enemy team, especially if your team is gap-close/AoE based, e.g. Tank Leona Flash + E + W + Q + R, over, say, Dragon wall while the enemy team is doing Dragon, followed up by an ally Katarina, Miss Fortune
 
**Itemization
 
##Items

 * *To-Be Added*
 
##Runes

I have two general rune sets for any tanks that I play

**Note:** For the Tank Jungler Rune set, Maokai, etc.

**Rune Set #1**

&gt; Name: Tanky Support Jungler

&gt; 9x Flat Armour Marks

&gt; 9x Scaling HP per Lvl Seals

&gt; 9x Flat MR Glyphs

&gt; 3x Quintessences of MS

&gt; Reasoning: My goal in this and purpose is to be the tankiest person on the team, e.g. champions like Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, etc., no, my friend, it's to gank all the lanes and snow ball them, in my mindset, and make silly plays as I tank any enemy DMG.

**Rune Set #2**

&gt; Name: Support Tank

&gt; 9x Flat Armour Marks

&gt; 9x Flat HP Reg Seals

&gt; 9x Flat MR Glyphs

&gt; 3x GP 10 Quintessences

&gt; Reasoning: This allows me to play my favorite Tank Support, as a hyper aggressive ""kill"" support. For any engagement that I make that isn't rewarded with a kill, I can simply shrug off thanks to the help of an Armour Bonus and the HP Reg Seals (Equivalent HP Reg of a Doran's Shield). The GP 10 Quints will put you slightly ahead of the enemy support allowing you to get more Wards out or finish a big ticket item quicker, which is huge as a support. 

##Masteries

You've got two ideal choices as a **Tank:**

**Mastery Page #1**

&gt; Name: Tanky Support/Jungler **""Snowballing Other Lanes""**

&gt; 0/9/21

&gt; Reasoning: Sometimes, yet with these Masteries, they allow you to make up for any loss of MS, allowing you to be wherever you're needed. Recommended if you're confident in your successful ganking potential to get off ganks rather than stay in the jungle.

**Mastery Page #2**

&gt; Name: Superior Jungle Tank **""Play-For-Late Tank""**

&gt; 0/21/9

&gt; Reasoning: A much safer mastery page to go with if you wish to solely help out in teamfights and have your entire team snowball off of those. Scales well into late game, take these masteries. Good for learning how to Tank

1362157596.0,19gyog,PSA: Viability,this1neguy,117,26,83,"Viability. I hate that word. I'm sick of that word. Everyone thinks that ""viability"" is the be-all and end-all of playing a champion

Voyboy not playing a champion doesn't mean it isn't viable.

LCS teams not playing a champion doesn't mean it's not viable.

Every champion in the game - *every. single. one.* - is viable in solo queue. ""But Karma-"" No. Karma is viable. ""But Heimerdinger-"" No. Heimer is viable. They may not be able to be universally first picked

This does not mean I'm saying go out and fuck around with ridiculous builds every chance you get - running AP Sivir because she has one AP ratio, find out what they're bad at. Find out situations where you can pull out that niche pick and do well with it. I remember terrifyingly well getting rolled by a Karma mid in a ranked 5s game because our mid player didn't know how to deal with it and the Karma got fed early and became an unstoppable force lategame. Watching Dan Dinh stomp games with Heimerdinger made me realize he's a pretty strong champion in the right place and time. 

It is possible to win with every champion in the game. Stop saying ""is [insert really obviously viable champ here] viable? I haven't seen [insert player's favorite streamer here] play him; does this mean he's not viable?"" Go play the damn champion for yourself. Stop relying on third party sources for all of your information. 

And no

ROAMING =&gt; ONLY when you are denying him farm. This is also when his minionwave is bigger and you see a garanteed gank or objective. Else it's not worth it to leave your lane. OR when your teammates really require your help


* 1.2 Midlane


Most midlaners are AP champions that have incredible scaling on their abilities

=&gt; You need alot of ward coverage because your lane has alot of entrances and angles for enemies to gank.
=&gt; You can roam the quickest to the lane that needs it the most

Any advantage you get from other lanes are always usefull to help you 1v1 your opponent. Make sure he can't clean-up after you succeed in a gank


* 1.3 Botlane

Push down your tower when you are ahead on your opponent, and you need to abuse the fact that he doesn't have a tier 1 turret anymore to protect him. 

If you roam


* 1.4 Jungler

This is probably the most important role during this phase when you want to ensure pressure on your opponents. He can help a lane that is getting pressured or help another lane to pressure even more. He should always push your lane when you and your opponent are gone. Lanefarm is incredibly strong right now on any jungler. He helps you when you get pressured, so you might get pressured too much but if your other lanes are winning and pressuring their opponents with the jungler, it's still worth it. As a jungler, you have to decide which opponent needs to be pressured at which time. You are the driver, that can decide whether your team will come out the strongest when you decide to group and push.


**2. OBJECTIVES PHASE : How to pressure objectives**


How to chose ? How to pick out the right objective to pressure ? An overview of the objectives with rising priority in order to pressure your opponent.


| Priority |            Description          |
|:------:|:-------------------------:|
|    1     |INHIBITOR                        |
|    2     |TIER 3 TURRET                  |
|    3     |TIER 2 TURRET                  |
|    4     |BARON NASHOR                 |
|    5     |TIER 1 TURRET                  |
|    6     |DRAGON                           |
|    7     |CHAMPION KILL                 |

However, and you'll have better control over jungle objectives and the minionwaves.


* 2.1 Dragon

This is extra gold for you and your allies. However

* 2.2 untill 2.4 Turrets

Each turret that you have more on one lane

* 2.5 Inhibitors

The pressure from this objective is incredible, and every objective you can take while they're busy protecting their Nexus brings you in a higher position and draws the win towards you slowly. Taking out one objective at the right time can guarantee a kill, even when you seem to be losing teamfights !

* 2.6 Baron Nashor

This enables you to push harder towards an objective. Sometimes you'll need it to take down an inhibitor


**3. HOW TO PUSH A WAVE ?**

To push a wave the best way

| Minion priority |               Description                |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|         1          |Super Minion                             |
|         2          |Cannon Minion                           |
|         3          |Ranged Minion                           |
|         4          |Melee Minion                             |

**Independent**

An independent champion is a champion that can lane against a large variety of enemy champions without help from jungle. Independent champions are good wave clearers

Karthus is not an independent champion. If you're playing Karthus and you get put up against Katarina or Diana of equal skill, and yes, he can work, but right now he's an incredibly risky pick because of the number of assassins in the game who can deny him farm. 

Compare this to Ahri. Ahri is very independent. She has few counter picks, for all intents and purposes, a better solo queue pick than Karthus. Lane independence is an extremely important concept in climbing the ladder.

**Strong**

A strong champion is a champion that is, but some people simply *insist* that their Heimerdinger or Galio is just the most OP thing ever. These people tend to be at Silver 4 with 300 games played in the division.

You need to pick a strong champion. You can't beat the meta with some unpredictable pick. Yes, but for the most part the strongest champions in the game are already fairly well known. Galio is currently a weak champion. So is Heimerdinger. So is Karma. So is Poppy. So is Shyvana. They *can* be strong under the right circumstances, but for the most part, you're just entering a swordfight with a pocket knife when you play them.

**Easy**

Easy champions are not that difficult to play

Jayce is an extremely hard champion (contrary to popular belief). Vayne is even harder, they could do the same. It doesn't work like that. If you were to put the same amount of effort into learning an easier ADC, like Caitlyn, Kog'Maw, or Graves, you would do far better for your time investment.

On the other hand, and Kennen is actually not hard at all with a bit of practice. These three champions also happen to be independent and strong, and can be a very nice part of a champion pool for solo queue.

1362419860.0,19ndtq,How to learn... Learning and Mindset,Angel_of_Clumsiness,99,14,17,"**Greetings Summoners!**


I'm looking to post a series of guides, more importantly, a detailed look on *how* these things can be acquired and how to learning progress works. So before I go into ""How To Learn...Lasthitting/MapAwareness/LearningNewChampions"" I figured I'll give some general advice in regards to learning and mindset within League of Legends.



**Baby Steps**

Learning things can be a bitch. Think of school...few people really like memorizing the capitals of all african countries (care to name Lesotho's?), but most people don't. There's just not much joy in it, and we tend to have subpar performances at things we dont enjoy.

It really is a pity. Small children enjoy learning *everything*. They face the world with a feeling of wonder and exploration where everything is new and fascinating and worth investing in, no harm done.

Then you grow up

Somewhere along the way

Sounds familiar?

Yeah

There's this friend of mine, the glamour of the pro scene and an infinitely high skillcap. So i took him under my wing and we started bashing some bots. He was extatic. That Enchanted Crystal Arrow is soooo strong. Oh, I get extra gold! I can buy moar swords! Why is a slow even good, this does nothing. This Nunu Bot is sooo annoying.... aaand so on. It was awesome to behold.

Then he started playing with other human beings. You can figure out the caveat in there. Needless to say



**Zen-Zap**

The first advice I gave him was: If someone makes your game unenjoyable in chat, a click and it's done). There's just no reason to endure a barrage of insults in your free time (or anywhere else, for that matter). This is a really easy thing to do to enhance your learning experience.

But that's about all you can do to control external factors, or miraculously learn to ward and teamfight. There is absolutely NOTHING that can change that (that's kind of a lie, but lets keep it at that for now). The only thing you can do is change how you react to this kind of things.

It's all about finding your inner Zen.

Not easy, not everyone needs to be fat, or grow long hair or smell of indian spices to enjoy a little bit of serenity here and there. Onwards to some actual advice!

* *Do not expect your teammates to be good*. It is teh Interwebz after all, +10 vs feeding), shrug at the bad guys, be happy with the good ones.

* *Do not expect to win*. This one is really counter-intuitive. After all, don't take it for granted that you actually DO win. Taking things for granted is the Road To The Ragequit. People generally get angry only if they got something tangible to loose (like your image of self-worth as defined by a playing game), and after all is said and done, it really is ""just"" a game. One you can invest in, take dead serious, learn about in the small hours of the night, root for in tournaments, for some

* *Give credits to your enemies*. Yep. You have all the feeders and they always have that 22/0 Katarina. And No, but you have no way of knowing in advance, and it might transform from one into the other. All allegories aside, underestimating the players on the enemy team leads to (but is not limited to): blaming your teammates, feeding the enemy kills, doing stupid things yourself, getting increasingly frustrated, ragequitting

Well, is not ""how to win"" but rather ""how to enjoying learning and getting better"". And before I dive in to the actual mechanics of learning (dividing brainpower and internalization, stay tuned for the next episode!) I felt it important to lay down a bit of *emotional* groundwork in preparation. You kinda need the sweetspot between not caring enough to improve and caring too much to be objective about. Both lead to not having very much fun, and learning without fun is kinda like going to school (...again. For me at least).



**Closing Words**

Wall of Text coming to an end here. There are a ton of ""mindset""-advice-posts on reddit but most agree on trying to ditch negative attitude (blaming others) in favor of a more serene state of mind focused on self-improvement, a.k.a. blaming others) and relearn things in a more open, humble way. It really DOES lead to aHappierLifeThroughGaming, I can assure you that over the smell of incense permeating my desk.

1st Example

[Tatertot](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/20634517#profile)

* What Summoner Spells should I take? Any special conditions?
&gt; For summoners you always take flash, take ignite. If you feel like you need some more protection and saftey, take heal/barrier.

* Which ADCs do you think have the most impact currently and why?
&gt; Currently I think Twitch, MF, and Caitlyn are some of the strongest ADCs. Ezreal, Graves, and Caitlyn all have fairly reliable escapes and each bring something different to the table. Graves brings a lot of burst and is fairly tanky. Caitlyn has the longest range out of the ADCs without any skills/passives influencing range. Ezreal has great poke and has a global ult. MF is good right now because of the combination of her ult and armor pen. She also has a strong laning phase that can lead to snowballing. Twitch is a great carry to have in a team as long as you can protect him; if you protect Twitch he will output some crazy damage in teamfights. His stealth is somewhat of an escape but can be unreliable. Also I believe Vayne may come back very soon with her buffs. A combination of buffing her scaling attack speed and the new Blade of the Ruined king (gives attack speed) Vayne could be another great ADC if you have the team to protect her.

* What do you look for in your support?  Agression / protection?
&gt; I look for a support who can be aggressive/passive when needed. For example, I look for Lulu to slowly poke down my laning opponents with me so I can gain a lead in the lane. After the laning phase I look for a support who can protect me during fights. Some good support+ADC combos for laning are Gravs/Taric, Ezreal/Sona, Twitch/Lulu.

*A first pass through some of the ideas:*

**General Mechanics:**

* Last Hitting
&gt; Last Hitting is the processes of killing a minion by Auto Attacking (AA).  This can be done by either right-clicking the minion or A-Moving (discussed later) with the minion being the closest target to you.  Last Hitting is commonly known as CSing.  (Derived from the term Creep Score.)
&gt;
&gt; * Why is last hitting important? 
&gt;
&gt; Last hitting helps you with lane control and gives you the gold you will need for items later on.

* Lane Control
&gt; The ability to keep the minions in an advantageous position for yourself while keeping your opponents at bay.  This is a crucial skill to have in all lanes; as it will allow your jungler to gank for you and

1350815886.0,11u8hk,An Overview of AD Carries,Contrite17,93,11,51,"The purpose of this overview is not to tell you which AD carries are the strongest or to tell you who you should play but rather to explain the strengths and weakness that each of the traditional AD carries has. I have split the AD carries into a few different sub categories based on when they are at their peak strength
__________________________________
__________________________________
**Late Game AD's**

* [](/tristana) 

Tristana has some of the highest early game burst of the AD carries and can be very scary when paired with an aggressive support. However in order for her to land her burst she has to commit 100% and will have no escape other then flash. If you can survive her burst do not be afraid to fight her as her auto attack dps is very low early game. She has the weakest midgame of all the AD carries bringing little damage and utility as her spells have no AD scaling. However

* [](/kogmaw) 

Kog'maw is the definition of the late game AD carry boasting 710 possible range and the second highest damage output of the AD's. He pays for this with a lack of mobility and decently low base defensive stats. His early game isn't particularly strong as both his range and damage require time to scale up

* [](/vayne) 

Vayne has a rather weak early few levels as she is entirely based on auto attacks and has low base defensive stats and 550 range. However at level 6 she gets a massive boost in survivability and damage output. She has a strong mid game and an amazing late game boasting the highest damage output of all the AD carries while having a stealth disengage. She is a fantastic chaser and the best dueling AD carry past midgame. She has issues with AoE CC and damage spells however as often she will have to be in range of them to do damage. Additionally her disengage can be countered by oracles. Try to abuse her early game weakness and end the game before she can hit her stride as she will nearly always out scale your AD carry.

* [](/ashe) 

I have Ashe here not because of her damage output which is the lowest of all the AD carries
__________________________________
__________________________________

**Mid Game AD's**

* [](/graves)

Graves is an interesting AD

* [](/ezreal)

Ezreal has both powerful burst damage and poke throughout the early midgame. His skill shots have very long range letting him harass or even farm at a very long distance. He is highly mobile but if you can engage on him he is very vulnerable to burst damage as he has low base defensive stats. His AS slow makes him a very strong duelist so if he hits you with it you should typically disengage unless you are significantly ahead. He has 550 range so he is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC however he can contribute to a fight even without being in auto attack range. He is a relatively strong poker all game but has a lower damage output then a lot carries and is among the squishiest.

* [](/corki)

Corki offers significant early game burst damage with his spells as well as fantastic poke post 6. He has high kill potential in lane especially when combined with an aggressive support like taric or Leona. Corki's valkyrie is very mana intensive so it should be used very sparingly. Corki trades very well early game with his bonus damage from his passive steroid and zero cast time spells. Midgame his armor shred make him and his team more do significantly more damage to their targets so avoid the gatling gun AoE. He is very mana dependent for damage especially if he rushes trifocre so be sure to watch his mana bar and do not be afraid to engage when he is low mana. Corki like many AD's has 550 range and is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC.

* [](/sivir)

Sivir has a lot of early game damage and wave clear with her boomerang and ricochet
__________________________________
__________________________________

**Early Game AD's**

* [](/caitlyn) 

Caitlyn has some of the best early game harassment and lane control with her 650 range and traps. She has a strong wave clear and can put a lot of early pressure on towers safely. Cait's escape has a windup and doesn't move her all that much for the cast time so don't rely on it too heavily. Cait's midgame and late game are neither horrible or noteworthy. Cait excels at tower sieges and defenses with her range and traps. Most carries can out damage cait but her range lets her stay relevant. Cait has relatively low burst damage but excellent poke so if you can hard engage you will often win the exchange. Be mindful of her ult as it is a potent execution throughout the game.

* [](/missfortune)

Miss Fortune has extremely strong early game damage with her auto attacks and you should avoid exchanges with her early in the game. She has a surprising amount of burst damage despite being auto attack based. Her ult does a lot of damage in a large AoE early game but falls off quickly. Her passive makes her extremely mobile around the map and makes her one of the strongest roaming AD carries. She lacks team fight mobility however and her short range makes her very vulnerable to the enemy. Her damage is very average in the mid and late game but she is a relatively strong duelist due to her healing debuff and stacking magic damage. Her 550 range leaves her vulnerable to AoE damage and CC.

* [](/varus) 

Varus has a very strong laning phase with his high damage poke and passive steroid allowing him to bully his opponent very hard. Varus is also one of the few AD's with hard CC making ganks and engages in bot lane easier then with many AD's. If you can dodge varus's Q then you should be able to out trade him in lane. Varus's strength is in his poke and his damage falls off when the lane phase ends. Varus's 575 range makes him safe from a lot of AoE damage and CC however and leaves him a decent sieger. Varus has no escapes and is vulnerable to gap closers and dives. 
__________________________________
__________________________________

**Other**

* [](/draven)

Draven is a weird one to place as he doesn't really have any weak point in the game in terms of damage and he technically has the highest theoretical damage output (though it will never be achieved in game) and a fairly strong lane phase. His early game auto attack will hit very hard so it is best to avoid trading with him early on

* [](/twitch) 

Twitch is a very gimmicky AD relying on stealth for positioning. While his damage output is high he lacks a real escape and has a relativly short range when his ult isn't up making him a risky pick. His ult allows him to do AoE damage with his auto attacks with 850 range so if left alive he has the potential to be a massive threat. However his short normal range and lack of defensive tools leaves him very vulnerable to being bullied and bursted throughout the game. His early game damage is deceptivly high with his passive stacking true damage doing a significant amount of damage early game and expunge hitting very hard in sustained fights. His damage while high takes multiple auto attacks before it picks up meaning he is very vulnerable to bursty lanes especially with his lack of escape tools. Twitch is very reliant on his ult to keep him at a safe distance so try to abuse its long cooldown when you see him use it. He is vulnerable to AoE damage and CC when his ult is not in use.

Being an avid stream watcher myself I shall answer in a somewhat general manner, ""omg all dyrus does is sit around and doesn't try n00b"" - you're entitled to your opinion and I am to mine.

Before I get into my favourites list I shall address the question of why you should bother watching streams. Watching pros play can be quite confusing for newer players as they do things that are unseen in low level games. Wards? Don't see many of those around. Watching pros is learning through observation. You can see exactly how long they wait before going for a last hit

I definitely getting [this extension if you're using Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edidfaijmhpefkbnobdcepampbncgejp) - the LoL Stream browser makes switching streams on the fly easy. :D

I will update this post as other streams become more popular.

Let's begin at the top.

* **Dyrus** || www.twitch.tv/tsm_dyrus || Dyrus is the top-laner for TSM, normally only plays top lane in high ELO solo queue and plays a large variety of champs. He doesn't always commentate but is good to learn lane tricks and counters from - watch his builds, his wards, his gank sychro with the jungler. 

* **Wingsofdeathx** || www.twitch.tv/wingsofdeath || Wings is the top-laner for the newly formed TSM.evo, powerful team. He made his rise to the top of the streamers by answering all questions people asked him on his stream chat and streamed when all pro players were at IPL4 and didn't steam. He answers a lot of questions, analyses his own mistakes and plays some fun top lane champs like Riven.

* **Wickd** || www.own3d.tv/live/18755 || Wickd is my favourite top laner, teaches you how to trade, how to freeze a lane, how to make the most out of a lane you are winning or losing, how to play against bad match ups, how to last hit well and how to stay positive at all times. His Irelia play is legendary as she's his favourite champ, but he can play pretty much anyone and do very well.

---

Let's move onto the mid lane.

* **Scarra.** || www.twitch.tv/scarra || Scarra is the AP mid player for Team Dignitas and is very popular among the community for having reached #1 on the NA Solo Queue Ranked ladder and answering a lot of questions on his live stream as well regarding AP mids. He never rages

* **Bigfatlp (jiji)** || www.own3d.tv/live/13576 || The AP mid for CLG.na

* **Froggen** || www.own3d.tv/live/112348 || ""Froggenivia"" is a popular AP mid player for his ability to absolutely decimate enemy teams using Anivia, get 16 kills anyway. Froggen answers a lot of questions on his IRC channel but doesn't talk much - instead he makes up for it with good music. So if you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to jump onto IRC and send him a private message.

* **Ocelote** || www.own3d.tv/live/2721 || Ocelote is the team leader of SK Gaming's LoL team and is a magnificent midlaner from Europe as well. Recently there's been a lane swap with him and one his team mates, he is playing in mid. He's very informative, answers questions as well and likes to discuss champion choices and justifies his plays, even if they go wrong.

---

I don't really watch many streams for the bot lane, do tell.

* **Aphromoo** || www.twitch.tv/aphromoo || Aphromoo is one of the most entertaining streamers I've had the pleasure of watching. Member of the recently formed TSM.evo as their AD Carry, often regarding item choices, counter picks and ideal supports.

* **Nhat Nguyen** || www.twitch.tv/nhatn || Nhat is a team member to Aphromoo and Wingsofdeathx and is a support player with a great reputation. His Blitzcrank is deadly and he's a pleasure to watch with his constant duo play featuring Aphoromoo. He plays all supports

* **Krepo** || www.own3d.tv/live/194947 || 'Skumbag Krepo' is the support player of the well known team CLG.eu. There's not much I can say about him except for him also being an exceptional support who always takes his supporting seriously. During CLG.eu team practise you'll often see Snoopeh and Wickd fooling around and it comes down to Krepo to get them back in line to prevent them from throwing the game.

* **Nientonsoh** || www.twitch.tv/nientonsoh || Nien was recently picked up by Orbit gaming and is known around the pros as an AD carry who has reached the very top of the NA Ranked Solo Queue ladder - often seen around the top 10. His mechanics are insanely good

---

Onto the jungle. Jungling is the most flexible and arguably the most influential role in a match

* **TheOddOne** || www.twitch.tv/tsm_theoddone || TheOddOne is the jungler for TeamSoloMid, unafraid to play junglers considered ""weaker"" at the moment, or not ""top-tier."" Very educational as he is able to somewhat objectively assess his own as well as his team's mistakes and what should have been done differently. Great for learning jungle routes, jungle wards, counter jungling and especially how to gank.

* **Saintvicious** || www.twitch.tv/crs_saintvicious || Saintvicious was recently picked up by Curse Gaming and is the former jungler of CLG.na. Saint

* **HotshotGG** || www.own3d.tv/live/13574 || HotshotGG is the former top lane player of the fabled CLG.na

* **Snoopeh** || www.own3d.tv/live/112350 || Snoopeh is the jungler of CLG.eu and is also very fun to watch. Snoopeh likes to play heavy CC

* **Malunoo** || www.own3d.tv/live/135706 || Malunoo is the jungler of Curse.eu and is one of the lesser-watched streamers. Due to this, he'll play epic oldschool gameboy games on an emulator. He duo queues a lot with Wickd in their ever strong Jungler/Top combo with very well coordinated ganks, carrying the toplaner to a higher elo on smurf accounts.

That's all I really can think off of the top of my head. I'll probably add a few more here and there. Most of these streamers are from CLG, leave them below!

1370349795.0,1fncai,It took forever.. but I made gold early this morning!,zebano,92,8,33,"Thanks for all the tips on this subreddit

My random tips...

1. If you're playing a poor pusher like Ryze be sure to tell your team ahead of time to pay attention to mia calls. Follow if you know which way they went but otherwise shove your lane (R is on really short CD

2. Know when your champ is strong. Mid I basically only play Ryze and I know I get blown up by Brand's combo until I get MR +HP (either of Spirit Visage or Banshee's are solid choices) so I just farm at tower.

3. In chess you can plan to play a scholars mate but if your game starts 1. e4 d5  (center counter) you need to adjust because they will almost certainly play d6 and your preplanned attack on f7 falls apart. LoL is all about adaption

4. As an ADC or Supp you need to chat ahead of time about how much chasing you're willing to do. I do not like engaging when there is a 9+ minion wave pushing against me at early levels. Auto-e disengage as Trist or I simply eat too much damage from minions. Many supports who play Taric or Leona will chase anywhere and go Look I stunned no jump in here! and there's no reason to play so risky (unless it's a sure win) when I have 200+ gold sitting there in a wave. 

5. If you can take a tower there is often little reason to try and kill the guy hanging around behind the tower. Get the objectives

6. As a jungler getting your mid to roam with you is the best way to ensure successful ganks followed by taking a tower. 

7. Pink wards are OP. If you play support and don't buy lots of pink wards you're doing it wrong. Vision denial is amazingly strong and will make your jungler love you. They also love it if you tell them river is warded but tri isn't or River ward expires at 5:45.

8. mute the ragers and rally what troops you can. LoL is a team game and you need a team to win.

9. Don't counterpick if you don't play the champion! I basically play Trist, Ryze, Sejuani with a small helping of Cho, Varus, Amumu, Xin and Swain when they're called for. Xin is played only when my top laner/Supp provides CC/initiation, Swain is only played against Akali, Varus is only played against Draven

1339363551.0,uv3pz,How to de-escalate an unreasonable player.,RobotRumpShaker,98,15,40,"Hello internet

I work in public schools for a living.  Many of the children I work with are fucking crazy

After a long period of rage quitting, I decided to return with a different approach.  So far, it's been about 90% effective in de-escalating unreasonable players who decide to fly off the handle when things don't go their way.  If your other team members fly off the handle, there may not be much you can do.  Also, its not going to make a terrible player a super star.  What it will do is take that angry, crazy little 8 year old controlling Master Yi via the internet and get him/her(?) under control.

Basically

1. Communication - If he/she doesn't talk

2. Inclusion - Even though they are being unreasonable

3. Momentum - Once things start to take a turn for the better, you have to make sure to keep the momentum going so that the team can move on.

I'm going to list some common situations, but just might do something to at least make the duration of your crushing defeat more pleasant.  

When you come across somebody who won't have any of what you're saying, follow through.  Your worries are over, and you can have a big sigh of relief knowing that you did everything that a man on the internet told you that you could do.

* Player refuses to go to their lane
These players just say no over and over in response to anything you say.  They may also just sit in a lane that they don't belong in hoping to force the other player out.  

Robot responses:

1. Master Yi

2. Master Yi

If they comply

* Player begins badmouthing teammates.
This one gets progressively more difficult to de-escalate as the game goes on.  People love to talk about other players' builds and purchases.  Sometimes

Robot Responses:

1. Master Yi

2. Master Yi

If the reason for the raging is a struggling player

* Teammates aren't listening/ruining everything! They pick champions/make decisions that don't make sense!

In the lower ranks


1. If teammates aren't responding to your suggestions or seem like they might not want to communicate in a productive way


2. Keep your tips/suggestions as positive as possible. Don't say that they're making mistakes or that what they have in mind is a bad idea. Be as clear and specific as you can to better sell your advice without insulting the customer (so to speak). Make it positive! Try ""You could get more kills if"" or ""They won't see you if you go here"" or ""You'll get more exp over here."" The goal is to facilitate communication between you and the other player

1370779300.0,1fz7k4,How Poro's can help you.,The_Incredible_Derp,94,14,22,"**Poro Locations**

There are several Poro on the Howling Abyss
http://imgur.com/xwlwwnm

**Poro Behavior**

The poro is a shy and fluffy creature, Ionian, Noxian,... on sight. Entering the bush will trigger the Poro escape mechanism and will make him run away. This will lead to him exiting the bush, and making himself visible to the opposing team. This way, they know that at least 1 enemy is in that bush. http://imgur.com/IjdKZ0F

**Poro Diet**

The Poro has a hard time finding edible food in this icy region, AND you have a Poro-Snax with you, the Poro will not run away! In fact, it will run towards you. This allows for an entirely invisible brush-entry. If you are satisfied with the location of the poro, you can feed him the treat, which will make some hearts pop over his head showing his affection. This will last for about a second, after which he will behave as normal again

The Poro can also be tricked into running the opposite direction if you were lucky enough to snag a champion with a gapcloser. Just dash behind the Poro and he should promptly run to your side of the map

**Miscellaneous Poro Information**

* Poro's can be marked with the Ping tool.
* They can be herded into the fountain turret for 4 gold (needs confirmation).
* Nunu and Cho'Gath can't Consume or Feast them.
* Syndra can not pick them up.

1370133744.0,1fhs35,Up From EloHell: How to carrry your noob feeder team,BlueNoseReindeer,99,19,16,"For those of you who haven't been on the internet very long

A bit more seriously, and would like to share some of those things.


* 1. Attitude is the most important thing. I like to keep track of helpful posts I find on this reddit about improving as a player, as well as humble in ""Freelo"" games is a necessary element in making comebacks/not throwing. What's more, **if you ever want to get out of ""EloHell,"" you can't believe that it exists**.

For example, I found myself starting off the game with 2 deaths, no flash, and no blue buff as Nautilus, with a Fiora as our top laner (not someone I expect much from). Every single lane was losing early, and we started off 0-6, with everyone being behind level and cs. However, and waited for them to make a mistake. Sure enough, which leads them to make foolish decisions

On the other hand, and blue on the invade, leading us on to a 9-0 + dragon start. We got cocky, and threw hard (fortunately they threw back, and we won in 50 minutes). I've lost games where we were up 17-1 with 5 towers and 2 dragons because of one simple rule: **good items can't replace good play**. When you get a giant lead it becomes tempting to mess around, get lots of kills, max out your build, ignoring what your enemy can do

As a last note on this subject, and the performance of everyone on your team who has to listen (and if you do it in all chat, it will boost the morale of the enemy team. Don't think so? What's your reaction when you see the other team flaming each other in allchat?). Trying to tell people how to play generally isn't a good idea either, unless they are asking for help even the best advice will usually be taken the wrong way. **Solo Queue is where you improve yourself, not the random people you get paired with, energy that you use to think about their mistakes (whether you bring them up or not) is energy that you aren't using to think about your mistakes.** That being said, sometimes criticism (usually not the constructive kind either) from your teammates can help you see what you're doing wrong (and sometimes they're completely off their rocker). If you can use the criticism they give you productively, you will do well in Solo Queue. I go into matches assuming that my team is going to be disagreeable (until they prove otherwise, it makes a huge difference

It may not be something you feel like putting effort into


* 2. Study the game, not just your own experiences. Streams, wikis, advice videos, guides, reddit, lolking,* and always be on the lookout for more sources. What's more

Big streamers are big for a reason (usually because they are on a team), and try out smaller guys sometimes. You will find some you like, and some you don't, but one very nice thing about all streamers with small audiences (that I've seen) is that you can ask any/all questions you have and expect an answer. One streamer I like that generally has &lt;100 viewers even asks his audience for questions so that he can kill time between ques!

Never latch on to any strategy/build/item/champion/comp etc. as something definite. People are always learning more about both the game and the current meta

Make it your goal to always be learning something new about the game. For example, successful strategies, or a high level game that you notice something in. **The key here is making a goal that you can stick to, and achieving it in a way that is still *enjoyable*.** Believe it or not, learning is something humans naturally enjoy, it's just  the way we go about it that sometimes makes the process unenjoyable. League should be something you enjoy doing, if it isn't

* 3. Take risks. Don't try to make plays that you know have little to no chance of success, and making decisions that help the rest of the team but challenge you personally are the type of risks you want to take. Why? Because these are the types of risks that will help you learn. If you ""can't carry hard enough"" for your ""noob feeder team,"" wouldn't you like to learn more so that you can? You can't change the types of teams you get, but you can change your performance and behavior, so focus on those.

Diving into the entire enemy team at baron pit while its till at half health is not a risk, or let the support ward around before starting baron. If they don't have wards, have them stand in the river bush as a lookout. Learn the difference between making a decision hastily (foolish) and hesitating to follow a decision (also foolish), disciplining yourself to make good decisions and not hesitate to follow them is a skill that every player regardless of rank needs to work on. 

There isn't much I can talk about specifically in this area, and if you don't then you have something to be happy about. **The reason why risk taking is worth it in the long run is because it gets you *doing* more: thinking more, learning more, firing brain cells more.** It puts you in new situations that make you do unexpected things, which may not be successful themselves, but allow you to learn more which helps you succeed in the long run.

I could talk more about stuff that I've learned that I think is important

 * To farm for CS, i.e. more EXP, Gold, and CS given to your top laner

 * Gank lanes in order to help that specific lane ""snowball"" ahead of his/her enemy laner. 

 * To keep an eye out for enemy ""mias, Dragon timers, where the enemy jungler is, etc. 

 * To ""cover"" lanes if a teammate dies, goes to gank another lane, etc. 

 * To have good decision making! e.g. Don't tower dive when you have the slightest hint that your teammates can't follow up on your dive.

 * **Most important!** Your #1 responsibility is **to be in the right place, do not go to farm wolves, get in position and gank them. This one key concept is what separates the ""good"" junglers from the ""bad."" Remember this, for it is key to success as the jungler. Although, I'm not saying that is all you need to know, for knowledge on the game's mechanics helps greatly, especially with your decision making, for objectives, you're not playing to your full potential as the Jungler. 

**Jungle Routes**

 * Remember to ask for help at Wolves or Wraiths when you start

 * Also ask for a ""pull/leash"" on whatever Buff you start at,"" if you guys pull off the leashing well, then your teammate shouldn't miss any CS or maybe just 1.

There are two general routes you can take

*Mana Dependant* - Wolves &gt; Golem Blue buff &gt; Wraiths &gt; Double Golems &gt; Lizard Red buff

 * Taking this path allows you to finish at the Lizard buff, so you may go jungle more, OR if you spot a ganking opportunity, you may go for that as well, for, after you finish Lizard buff you have access to, depending on which side you're on, then quick access to Bot Lane

*Non-Mana Dependant* - Wraiths &gt; Lizard Red buff &gt; Double Golems &gt; Wolves &gt; Golem Blue buff

 * Taking this path allows you to finish at Golem buff OR, giving him/her the upper hand during early game. Remember that by this time, both Wolves and Wraiths will be up again, so you may go jungle more, OR if you spot a ganking opportunity, you may go for that as well. You're close to Top Lane if you're on Blue Side and close to Bot Lane if you're on Purple Side. This is only IF you're ""healthy"" enough for a gank.

**When/How to gank as a Jungler** 

**The How**

 * Ask your teammate

 * If something is warded

 * If a bush isn't warded

 * When ""waiting for the right time"" to initiate the gank,"" Katarina just used ""Shunpo,"" Ezreal just used ""Arcane Shift,"" etc., the enemy laner is overextending greatly, or if the enemy laner is extremely low and is hugging his/her tower (generally applies for ""behind the tower"" ganks)

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/escapes, also you may not even need to use them if the gank is executed correctly, and may just perform a successful gank with just the Slow from Red Buff. 

 * Learn to focus the more important targets first, for you'd want to rather ""Shutdown"" the ADC early on so you may help your Bot Lane ""snowball"" ahead, than get a kill on the 0/3/2 Support and let the 3/0/0 ADC get away.

 * Be extremely map aware! It's partly your responsibility to ward or at least be aware of ALL areas, meaning that could open up possible gank opportunities. 

**The When**

Knowing how to gank is one thing

 * Know the position of your enemy jungler so that an opportunity for a gank can form, this opens up a gank opportunity for you to gank Top Lane w/o fear of a counter-gank.

 * Only gank if you're fairly positive you won't get killed or get a teammate killed

 * Only gank if you're ""healthy"" enough for a gank, etc.

 * When the enemy laner is pushed your teammate out of lane and is attempting to take out the tower. 

 * When the enemy laner has no wards placed down, etc., e.g. Lacks sustain and/or vision.

 * When the enemy laner uses his/her only for of CC or escape, Caitlyn's Net, etc.

 * Even if the enemy hasn't used his/her CC ability or for of escape, etc., will really help here) this may include: Riven's Broken Wings, Katarina's Bouncing Blades, Nidalee's Spear, etc. 

 * When the you ""spot"" an enemy ""out of position"" so that you may ""catch"" him/her, if necessary.

 * Try to only gank when your teammate is aware of your incoming gank, etc. AND be sure he's in a good position to gank, i.e. isn't OOM, low on HP, has no Flash (situational), etc.

**There are probably many, thank you!**

**The Difference between a ""Successful"" gank and a ""Bad"" gank**

The main differences between a ""Bad"" gank and a ""Successful"" gank include:

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you ""burn"" the enemy's Flash w/o using your own or having your teammate use his/her own. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to get the kill, say having your Mid Laner have a Flash while the enemy Mid Laner doesn't have his/her's can be a big factor on who will eventually ""win"" the lane and ""snowball"" ahead. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you ""trade"" well in terms of kills, i.e. forcing the enemy support or ADC to go back to Base to heal or ""hug"" the tower. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if you or your teammate gets a kill out of the gank w/o dying.

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" gank if your teammate is are forced to ""hug"" the turret and you make the enemy laner back-off through a potential kill, thusly relieving pressure on that lane for your teammate. 

 * It is considered a ""Successful"" counter-gank if you happen to kill either the enemy Jungler or ADC

 * It is considered a ""Bad"" gank if you happen to die or, underestimating the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, overestimating your potential DMG output, making bad plays, not having your teammates be ""healthy"" enough for the gank, not knowing the position of the enemy jungle in case of a counter gank, diving underneath the enemy turret w/o any follow-up, not communicating with your teammates well enough

As you can see, the When and How, is really all boiled down to knowing the game's mechanics, whether that be DMG output, Builds, ability CDs, etc., **decision making, to make the right ""calls"" at the right time. Always,"" 'Take Mid Inhibitor then Baron?

**Counter Jungling**

Counter Jungling is essentially the idea that you, go into the enemy jungle to ""steal"" enemy camps, buffs, etc., allowing you to get ahead in terms of CS, Gold, and levels

 * You can counter jungle if you're ""healthy"" enough to do so to take the enemy camps w/o dying and enough HP to survive if you're ""caught"" in the enemy jungle.

 * It is safer to counter jungler when you know the position of your the enemy jungler and the position of the enemy laner closest to the side of he enemy jungle that you're in.

 * This ""safety net"" can be obtained by warding the enemy jungle, frustrates the enemy Jungler to no end, despairing him/her, pushing him.her farther behind. 

 * Learn the timings on all Junglers so that you know when, so that you may potentially ""catch"" him/her her while on low HP, get the kill, and take the buff or even give it to a teammate. 

**Applying Pressure as a Jungler**

As the Jungler, these include: (if I miss any, let me know in the comments please!)

 * *Presence* - Just walking into one of your teammate's lane, and/or CS away, will ""pressure"" the enemy laner and make him/her back off and start playing ""safely,"" or might even prevent him/her from CSing at all, due to fear. Sometimes, you don't even have to walk into the lane itself, if there is an enemy ward about, you can just clear it to make enemy laner think you're ""there.""

 * *Counter-Jungling* - By counter jungling the enemy Jungler, thusly making the enemy laners more cautious and wary for your ganks since they can't rely on his/her Jungler as much due to him being behind having to stay in the jungle longer.

 * *Killing Wards* - Making the enemy team ""blind"" is a scary and very worrying thing, you'll be forcing the enemy team to make ""blind"" decisions. This, in turn, can open up many opportunities like ""forcing"" fights at Dragon or Baron, ""catching"" enemy players that are trying to ward out of position, prevent roaming from enemy laners, thus relieving pressure on your team's lanes

 * *Behind/Under the enemy Tower ganks* - This applies massive pressure on the enemy laner! It let's him/her and the rest of the enemy team know that you're skilled enough to know how to execute these well and are not afraid to, early game-early mid game that is, sometimes late game, for it requires an exact calculation of your DMG output, your teammates DMG output, you and your teammate's HP, the enemy's HP, resistances, enemy counter-gank ""clean ups

**Invading vs. Defending**

At the beginning of the game, ""Should I Invade to ""steal"" buffs with my team early on or should I Defend my own jungle?"" These choices are:

*Invading* - When you ""invade"" the enemy jungle, you will, if you meet at least one of these criteria:

 * Your team composition is much stronger at LVL 1 than the enemy's team composition, your team has more DMG potential at LVL 1 or are tankier, etc. 

 * You have Blitzcrank to ""grab"" someone for First Blood.

 * You or someone of your team has snares, taunts, etc. AND the enemy team doesn't (sometimes). 

 * You're Syndra and are able to ""pull"" away the Blue Buff or Red Buff over the wall

*Defending* - When you ""defend"" your jungle from potential enemy ""invasions"" due to:

 * The enemy composition is much stronger at LVL 1 than the your team's composition, the enemy team has more DMG potential at LVL 1 or are tankier, etc. 

 * The enemy team has Blitzcrank to ""grab"" someone for First Blood. (Be very

 * Someone of the enemy team has snares, taunts, etc. AND the your team doesn't (sometimes). 

 * The enemy team has Syndra and are able to ""pull"" away the Blue Buff or Red Buff over the wall

 * If you want to just play it ""safe"" and not risk anything.

**Objectives - Towers, Dragon, and Baron** 

(Will later be adding the significance of these objectives to achieve Victory

 * *Towers* - When one tower is taken down, a bit over the gold received from a kill, (not factoring in Bounty)

 * *Golems* - Gives 82 total gold from killing the enter Golem buff camp
Transfers to the player who kills the buff owner. Lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Spawns every 5 minutes prior to being slain.

 * *Lizards* - Gives 81 total gold from killing the entire Lizard buff camp

 * *Dragon* - When slain

 * *Baron* -  When slain

**What champions can be played as Jungler**

 * *The Godlike Gankers* - Some champions that fall into this category, Rammus, etc., and are classified by his/her amazing ganking potential thanks to his/her kit which generally includes some form of gap closer, a hard CC, and are fairly tanky enough to dive under turrets for kills. 

 * *The Counter Junglers* - Some champions that fall into this category, Shyvana, Vi, etc., and are characterized by his/her counter jungling potential thanks to his/her kit allowing to safely and quickly ""steal"" enemy camps, and are able to duel 1v1, and win

 * *The Global Presence Junglers* - Some champions that fall into this category, Gangplank, etc., and are characterized by his/her ability to apply global pressure to all lanes, thanks to his/her kit (generally Ultimate), without necessarily being present in a lane or a teamfight.

 * *The Burst Gankers* - Some champions that fall into this category, Fizz, Evelynn, etc., and are generally characterized by his/her ability to initiate gank and ""burst"" down the enemy champion in 1 combo before he/she can Flash away.

 * *The Duelist* - Some champions that fall into this category, Udyr, Warwick, etc., and are characterized by his.her ability to duel 1v1 and win thanks to his/her kit. These champions are generally used to splitpush while the rest of the team ""forces"" a fight somewhere else. 

 * *The Teamfighters* - Some champions that fall into this category, Jarvan IV, etc., and are characterized by his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although he/she may not perform amazingly well in the jungle, or may be very prone being counter jungled, they will definitely pay back with his/her worth during 5v5 teamfights.

 * *The CC Machines* - Some champions that fall into this category, Udyr, etc., and excel at constantly applying heavy CC to an individual enemy or the entire enemy team. These champions tend to be excessively tanky making them ideal initiators. 

 * *The Sustain Masters* - Some champions that fall into this category, Xin Zhao, Vi, etc., and are characterized by his/her ability to stay very ""healthy"" while jungling allowing him/her to constantly stay within the jungle to apply pressure without having to go back and potentially getting behind. 

Those are the main categories,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**Constructing your build as a Jungler**

Constructing your build as the Jungler is very situational, making your reliance on just ""one build"" a very poor choice to pursue. Since you have the 2nd lowest Gold generation, 1 position higher than the Support, your build must be:

 * **Appropriate to the enemy composition, Randuin's Omen to shutdown AA dependent ADCs, Bulwark for the ""balance"" AP and AD enemy team, Negatron Cloak for an AP heavy enemy team, etc.

 * **Cost efficient, so you'll have to get ""cost-efficient"" items like Aegis of the Legion, Locket of the Iron Solari, Spirit buffs, Nashor's Tooth, etc. 

And that's my guide on How to play the Jungler! i hope you all enjoyed reading it and at least learned something from it. Again

**Note** I don't know what kind of guide to write next, (I've played all champions except all the ADCs (minus Ashe), or another guide on a certain lane like Support or Top Lane, or a guide on the fundamentals of Twisted Treeline, etc. Just let me know in the comments about what you'd all like for me to write about and I will! Thanks!

Newsflash: bottom lane is the hardest lane to gank, but usually I won't waste my time. In botlane, this is especially important. Why?

Because in botlane, zoning, warding and generally being the most awesome dude on the team. Mid, top and ADC players at my level rarely ward, so it's easier to gank top or mid. Supports, however, unfortunately get stuck with warding for the whole team. This means that botlane is a battle for vision.

Before I gank

1. Are you warding?
2. Are they warding?

The first one I can obviously answer myself with a glance at the minimap, but that one's not *as* important. The most important wards are the ones he puts in the river.

If you see him place one (ie he doesn't go into the fog of war to do it) ping it and make a note in the chat along the lines of 'river bush warded'. I have timers on the chat

Better yet

The ideal situation for a bottom-lane gank is this:

1. You have a pink ward in the river brush and they have nothing.
2. The enemy team has the lane pushed up.
3. I have vision on their jungler.

This last one is more for me to worry about

So basically, ganking top successfully and clearing some more before going to base) I *will* reply with 'Where have they warded?'. If you can't answer, I'm not going to waste my time and potentially my life on the off-chance they didn't ward. Because Murphy's Law says they did. The only way you're getting a gank botlane in that situation is if they're knocking on your turret and I see their jungler top.

Counterwarding is not a difficult thing to do, great. That'll help me gank and I'll be happy with just that. If you can do the second part as well I will love you forever and camp bot for days, other lanes pending.

EDIT: As WardTax has pointed out to me, you'll have a massively fed Glorious Executioner tearing your team to shreds and no sufficient answer. So I'm not saying don't gank at all; more that if they want to pull you away from your intended route (clearing, covering and ganking included), they need to make sure it's not wasted.",,False,self,1372672891.0,t3_1herl5

Yes

I have played the game for 1.5 years

I expect many of you are in this exact position and I intend to share with you how I have suddenly skyrocketed my elo. It all started when I was eating pizza in my underwear and watching XJ9 streaming his famously brutal jungle Vi. I was more interested in his macro-based decisions rather than his micro (explained later) and I wanted to understand why he chose to go where and when. After a couple of hours of watching his Vi and Hecarim everything just suddenly clicked and it all seemed so obvious. Shit

I'd been a little shy of the jungle before

1. My mechanics are bad. I can last hit just fine, is quite good.

2. I am bad at freezing/controlling lanes.

3. I am bad at attack-moving and kiting. This is why I avoid playing AD carry completely.

4. I am bad at making calculated trades/damage exchanges.

5. I am extremely terrified of being ganked

6. In my average game

7. It is too difficult to consistently get the popular mid and top lane at this elo and not then get immediately counterpicked.

So, especially after 1.5 years of solid play. I instead decided to minimise those weaknesses completely and stick rigidly to jungle and support roles, allowing me to capitalise on my far stronger areas of play:

1. My map awareness and prediction skills are really good. I have a talent for reading the mind of the enemy jungler and anticipating his presence for a countergank. Is your ally low and cowering behind their tower? Wait in the jungle behind them and expect a dive. This works marvellously well.

2. My champion knowledge is excellent. I know exactly how to gank every lane in the game properly, Ezreal, Tristana, Corki, Kassadin, LeBlanc, Garen or Nidalee I will pick Vi every time

Well, shot over 1400 easily leaving behind a trail of horribly battered enemy teams behind me. I also played a lot of Hecarim also using XJ9's build to great success, often asking my team to pick an AOE comp, which completely obliterates low elo team fights.

**How you can get out of Silver:**

* Recognise your weaknesses and either work to strengthen them or minimise their use.
* Pick something to main and practice relentlessly. Perfect your style and become famous amongst your friends and feared amongst your enemies for your signature lane and champion.
* Find a pro player who is famous for using one or two champs and watch and emulate their playstyle religiously. I used XJ9's Vi and Hecarim.
* Use your brain
* If you're not typing anything of tactical value
* Take as much responsibility as possible for any mistakes that your team makes. Try and blame yourself whenever possible; self-criticism is invaluable. Preaching in all chat to the enemy team about how your team sucks tells me
* As a jungler, you should know how Yorick doesn't need items to be good in a teamfight and shoulb ignore his lane; he is worthless without your AD carry being strong so gank bot instead. If their bot lane is fed, do not gank it, as you will be ganking into a fed ad carry and support and will most likely give them a kill. Your 7/0 Fizz is excellent, but never wards? Ward his lane. Find your strong players, camp and ward their lanes. Give them the opportunity to carry you.
* As a solo-queue jungler, ready to mute the 0/5 Yorick that is crying about Akali behind his top tower, ready to camp that enemy bot lane mercilessly with pink wards. People will cry at you. You will mute them instantly without a word in reply.
* You must time your buffs, baron and flashes if possible. You can find a number of free iPhone apps for this.
* I bound both pings to my side mouse buttons and now I watch the map and ping my team constantly. This wins games
* Know what you're capable of ganking and pick accordingly - Hecarim can't gank certain champs that Vi can easily secure kills on. However, Galio and Gangplank, Hecarim would be a much nastier pick for the wombo combo. I often pick Hecarim and ask my team to make an AOE comp.
* Farm. Junglers don't need to be poor; take CS and towers whenever you can when your lanes are unoccupied.
* Anticipate the enemy jungler and laners moves. Counter tower dives and ganks with smart prediction and warding.
* Forced a flash? Back off and gank them again immediately.
* Do not camp unless you are sure you have a very good chance of securing a kill.
* If your top laner is Malphite
* Assess your team's level one strengths and capability of initiating or defending from a level 1 invasion. If you are defending
* Don't smart-cast Q with Vi
* There are only a few jungle main players compared to the hordes of top and mid mains. Master the jungle and allow the top and mid mains to take their favourite roles. Most junglers in solo queue pick it because they don't want to ad or support. If you're an experienced jungle main playing versus an enemy jungler who didn't get to top or mid
* Does your team comp have an initiation? Do you have at least one tank? Are you able to start a fight? If not then you are severely damaging your chances of winning. Do you have anyone capable of reaching that Vayne in their backline? It pains me when I am on a team of squishies and our jungler locks in Fiddlesticks.
* Enrage and annoy the enemy team as much as possible in all chat when you're dead or you have your hands free. Whilst dead
* Learn how to gank every lane. With mid
* If you're utterly hopeless at this game
* If you are not either farming or ganking/counterganking or moving to do one of these at any given moment
* Many Silver players are dumb as shit (I used to be one) and will overextend without wards. Gank them over and over. Destroy them. Make them cry. Make them call you a babysitter. Kill them again and again and again.
* If you're far ahead and fed
* Buy red flasks even if you're not at full build.
* Enemy team comp has Irelia

By the end of reading this

Platinum is now an attainable and realistic goal for me now and I will post again with an AMA should I be successful.

Ok my TL;DR failed hard

EDIT: My builds are on my lolking

Hecarim: 

0/9/21 because these masteries are retardedly good on Hecarim. The XP bonus is so, underlevelled brick.

9 ARpen marks

Get Spirit stone and boots first back, get Kindlegem and maybe then Spirit Visage. Buy the other item next and then get tank items. It's not necessary to buy and complete items in perfect order. Quite often, I'll finish SotEL and get a Kindlegem, Chain Vest, Negatron Cloak, Glacial Shroud, Spirit Visage and then finish my Iceborn Gauntlet. That would be me quickly adapting to strong AD and AP enemies, which I would normally do when fed.

Do not be fooled into investing all of your gold into movement speed for Hecarim; it isn't necessary and just makes you squishy. You only need to be a little faster than your enemies to catch them, CDR and armour pen. The best component from his passive is the ignoring unit collision part.

Start W. Max Q&gt;W

Vi:

21/9/0 because you want to be a glass cannon terror early and mid game.

6 attack speed and 3 ARpen mars

Boots, Spirit of the Elder Lizard, then tank items with plenty of HP. Finish Black Cleaver at some point later. The early 20% CDR from Brutaliser and SotEL will enable you to gank with your ulti often, which is almost always a confirmed kill.

Start W

1374882838.0,1j4qc4,I made a rather large list of (not so) meta breaking champions to play!,Btf117,98,22,53,"Hai folks. I've made a list of champions to play to spice up your gameplay. I find that variety makes League so much more fun to play. Now keep in mind these aren't really the most optimal to do, this means I highly recommend them.

For people who don't like taking advice from non-pros, you'll see a lot of support suggestions and a lot of supports playing other roles.

**Important note - all the builds I suggest on these champs may not work for everyone. And
***
Support Urgot - Behind Olaf and Heimerdinger, even though Doublelift has no problem with him. But here's what makes Urgot strong as a support: 

* Passive reduces the damage output of targets affected by Urgot's AAs and Qs. It's like a mini exhaust every time he autos.
* Urgot's E shreds percentage armor. This allows your ADC to land more damage onto their opponents with their autos and this leads to more bullying.
* Urgot's ultimate (R
* Building him

I am actually 2-0 with Urgot support
***
**Jungle Lulu** - She OP

* Her ganks are some of the best in the game, and because the mid is most likely walking in a straight line to get out of lane as fast as possible, and this makes landing the Q not typically difficult. The massive slow hits, and hopefully your lane can secure the kill.
* She's a support jungle. This can be a problem for some but the meta works with this style of jungler.
Ulting the ADC or mid and your EW provide awesome peel

Now

**Pros**

* Solid ganks
* Very strong 4-16
* Can be built AP or AD depending on the situation
* Provides good peel on potential high-value targets
* You are one with Phreak

**Cons**

* Mana hungry
* Pretty spell dependent
* Can fall off late game
* Dependent on successful ganks

She's so much fun
***
**Support Orianna** - Ori is a character that's pretty strong in the bot lane. You can play her in the kill lane style

* Max R &gt; E &gt; W&gt; Q, and hard CC with Ult.
* Orianna is a poke support. Like Lulu and Nami
* Ultimate sets up ganks. This works in favor of your jungler when you land a solid ult
* She's still plenty viable in teamfights. Ult's hard CC is very strong against channel characters like MF, and Malzahar.

***

**ADC Thresh** - I've seen this done a lot more than any other of the suggestions here

* Max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q. E is very important
* E passive
* Because ADC Thresh thrives on mixed damage
* I find that I usually don't jump a second time when landing Q. Usually the target runs from me when I land it
* W provides gap closing for your jungler when he comes to lane. Especially on purple team, pop a lantern and then Q, and that's a surprise gank very few people see coming.
* E and Q interrupt channeling spells like an MF ult
* Thresh works as a solo bot on Twisted Treeline. Lantern the camps your jungler is farming
* And finally
***
Jungle Soraka - I took this off my recommended list because I am probably the only person that deal with playing it. Soraka's Q MR reduction makes her clear possible and kite/sustain potential with W allows her to not die immediately. Her ganks rely a lot on the enemy overextending
***
Mid Blitzcrank - Crunk is crazy in the midlane, he can be a menace.

* It's all about hitting the pulls with AP Crunk. He relies on landing the combo (both pre and post 6) and letting the enemy mid retreat after damage is done.
* Post 6
* At any level, or junglers that need time to get into lane like Udyr.
* You can bait a lot of dives and ganks with mana barrier. It
* Because of Blitz's large mana costs, Lich Bane, Rabadons, Zhonya's, and DFG, Frozen Heart, or Banshee's depending on the situation and enemy team. 
***
Mid Taric - Another support going as an AP mid? Yup. Taric provides good CC and sustain to lane

* I max R &gt; W &gt; Q &gt; E. Shatter provides Taric with good AA poke prevention
* Like I just mentioned, such as Tiger Udyr, Xin, or J4 that will assist in planting a lot of damage down onto your opponent.
* Q kites and baits ganks. The heal won't be amazingly large because you're not maxing it first, and, if your jungler is nearby, enough time for a countergank.
* When/if your enemy mid is out of lane, with your jungle) to push the mid tower. This can give you an extra boost for your other laners, and, if you want to, opens up more ganking patterns.
* Do not forget to ward! Taric isn't naturally that fast
* I build Mid Taric a bit more tanky than usual AP mids,  Zhonya's, Mobility, Sorcerer's, or Merc's for boots, Abyssal Scepter, and maybe a Rabadons or Banshee's. 
***
ADC Twisted Fate - I remember back in Season One that TF was played a lot as an AD character. Then again

* I max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q. The passive AS bonus from E is what keeps ADC TF running.
* W provides solid utility. Picking Gold card will either force your opponents to back off, although it won't do a lot of damage. Blue card has no utility benefit and thus deals the most damage.
* Supports that work well with TF include Nami, so that can help TF is he builds AS before his AD.
* R gives you a great way to freely split push in later game. If your team doesn't have a good person to split push themselves, you can ult in. If they all suddenly go MIA, you can ult, see were they're going, and escape if they're coming to block your split push. You can also surprise gank mid in the laning phase, hopefully netting you the kill. During this time, you should tell your jungler to pick up some farm in your lane. This will help him
* I usually build BotRK, Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, and a Scimitar or another BT. Of course, like with most ADC builds, it's dependent on what you want to do, but I suggest, a good amount of attack speed to get E up faster.
***

**Top Rammus** - I've been playing since the release of Xin - so early season one. Karth was the first character I ever got a kill with, but I've played Rammus for so long that I like him in any role.

* I only put Rammus as a top character because the goal is to face an AD. I actually think Rammus is better in the mid lane than he is top
* Armor. I played a ranked game where I first picked Rammus jungle (somehow I was beat out of playing support) and I was put against a team of four APs (Malz, Lulu, and MF). I knew that it would be annoying, so instead of completely compromising my damage, I built Aegis first (we did two bulwarks because our support wouldn't communicate, but that's beside the point) and built around the fact I needed MR to counter them. Because max rank E grants 120 Armor and MR, you can build some of the items you want to build anyway and don't compromise your whole build. Just don't be silly and build a thornmail. I'm not sure if this point made any sense, still build *some* armor regardless of the situation.
* Fiddle's Q fear and Rammus' E taunt are probably on the same level of pure frustration. They are just cruel to play against. And that's why I max it first. &gt;:D
* I max R &gt; E &gt; W &gt; Q against lanes that you are doing fine against
* You are another great person to set up ganks, and either fight them or lead them to your jungler/mid (whoever is ganking).
* I take Flash/Exhaust compared to my usual Flash/Teleport on top characters. Because Rammus is fast with Q
* Rammus' wave clear is like Shen's - pretty slow until you get sunfire. However
* Start defensively. Rammus is pretty weak at level one and early in general, or Rejuvenation bead + 2 wards + pots depending on your personal style and lane matchup.
* Against heavy AD teams, Thornmail, Warden's, Bulwark, and Frozen Heart.
* Against heavy AP teams, Tabi or Mobility, Sunfire, Spirit of the Ancient Golem, Warmog's, and Abyssal (in some cases).
* Against balanced teams, or mobility, Spirit of the Ancient Golem, Sunfire, Bulwark, Thornmail, and Warmogs or Warden's
***
**AP Top or Mid Susan** - I'm not really sure if I should even give myself credit for this one, his ratios are pretty good and with farm on his Q he can be flat out unstoppable.

* Lich bane is a must. Because Q applies on hit effects
* I max R &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; W. I think it's pretty simple why: R and E are most impacted by AP, it is nearly impossible to dodge and that means a good amount of damage on your opponents.
* Compared to AD Nasus
* Nasus has passive lifesteal and armor shred with E
* It's also difficult to build offensively against Nasus. W slows down movement speed and attack speed by a ton

Anyways, is not understanding what I did wrong, to even have the chance to improve it. As a jungler, almost all of your outplay comes not in mechanics but in outhinking and out-decision making your opponent jungler. Jungler is the heaviest and most taxing of positions on your personal game knowledge. And if the other jungler has a higher game knowledge than you and wrecks your early game, it is the most devastating snowball a game can experience. Sure camping a single lane is awesome, but that doesn't usually win the game. When you get behind as a jungler, it doesn't just affect one lane

Me personally as a player

1370035324.0,1fffw0,A Game of Pressure: This isn't Call of Duty,BlueNoseReindeer,91,19,29,"Hi guys

A common mistake that I see even as a Platinum player is the inability to create genuine pressure (let's say that pressure is defined as your ability to control your opponent). To win League you need to kill the enemy team's nexus, you must ""pressure"" them away from them.

With that being said, but not always. 

If you have pressure, kill dragon/baron, get inhibs, etc. because they can't stop you for whatever reason. Now, let's take a look at what some of those reasons are.

* Raw Power. Draven-Leona is the most powerful starting bot lane I can think of, push towers, etc. They don't necessarily need to get kills to be effective, the threat of being able to kill is good enough. In a straight up fight with no turrets and equal minion damage, Draven-Leona will beat everything. Beating a Draven-Leona combo requires poking/kiting, lowering the amount of power they have to the point where they CAN be beaten in a fight (for more on team comps read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fa711/composition_analysis_next_level_solo_queing/).  Always remember (particularly at earlier stages of the game) that minion damage is factored into raw power, both in the jungle and the lane. A team with more raw power that maneuvers effectively (which is the trick) can safe take towers, and Barons, level

* Wards. Wards create pressure if you use them correctly. Leona has bush control? Put a ward in (not next to her or she'll kill it) and for 3 minutes that bush is as much yours as hers. But then she pinks it, *controlling where you go*, AKA creating pressure. Vision gives knowledge, and knowledge is power. Remember last paragraph When I talked about maneuvering properly? Wards allow you to do that by seeing what your enemy is doing, and what you need to do in response. More commonly, wards serve as anti-pressure, denying the enemy's ability to control you

* Minion waves. Minions waves are a big part of why split pushers are viable in LoL. Take Singed for example, he is able to splitpush, creating pressure. Because of this pressure the enemy goes to react, and will usually try to fight him, resulting in a chase, which is the only reason he can pick up kills. If Singed is able to draw more than one person to him, the rest of his team has a clear advantage, then moving to the opposite side of the map and pushing there has a similar effect. The enemy team must either send someone to deal with this wave and seriously risk losing a tower

* Cooldowns. Cooldowns are essential to determining real Raw Power, such as Shen and Karthus ults) is so important. If you are able to force/bait out an ultimate, your engage will be stronger than theirs, and you should use this to your advantage.
tl;dr Cooldowns of abilities are factors people overlook more than just about anything else. Take this into account when determining Raw Power to make a play.

* Jungler. Jungle pressure is something you probably hear a lot about, and will almost always result in more Raw power for the ganker, which can result in kills or forcing someone out of lane. This type of pressure is designed to ""snowball"" a lane. What that means is that if the gank is successful, their is still work left to be done. After being given an advantage, the laner should (at least temporarily) have more Raw Power, and be able to create pressure for the team in their lane by 1: drawing enemy jungle pressure (and not falling to it) so that they cannot make plays on other lanes 2: taking the tower to give global gold/exp and increased roaming opportunities so that you can pressure other lanes 3: deny farm in order to reduce the amount of Raw Power that the enemy will have.

* Kills. Kills are a great way to set yourself ahead, and missing the experience from a couple waves may give the opportunity for the enemy to have more Raw Power than the longsword/amp tome that you just bought gave you. It's very important to distinguish between lategame kills, and early game kills. Early game kills can lead to snowballing, but if they don't, are relatively insignificant. Late game kills can lead to losing objectives, but if they don't, are similarly insignificant. As such, you are looking to get yourself ahead and/or set the enemy back because this is how you create pressure. If you get kills after the laning phase

* Most Net Pressure. As several of the previous paragraphs (the last one in particular) have alluded to

(I'm sure I'm not including everything

League is an objective-oriented game, and applying pressure to objectives as best you can given those compositions (i.e. grouping as an AOE comp, splitpushing as a splitpush comp, etc.) is how you win games.

Her burst after Deathfire Grasp is very high. Be careful if she is MIA as Eve has amazing roam potential. Most often seen mid

**Ezreal**: Ranged, and his W, a medium ranged skillshot that passes through minions. His E is a ground-targetted blink. His ultimate is a wide, global skillshot. His W, E and ultimate all do magic damage. He will often buy Phage/Trinity Force for the slows, which proc on his Q. His burst damage is very high during early and mid game, as is his mobility. Seen bot lane. Average difficulty.

**Fiddlesticks**: Medium ranged AP caster with huge AoE damage potential. He has a long duration fear with his Q, is a channelled spell that deals damage and returns health to Fiddlesticks over time. His ultimate is a blink that will cause crows to fly around him for the next 5 seconds, dealing huge amounts of damage. He will often try to sneak up on you behind walls and use his ultimate, however, his MR-lowering passive appears as a debuff on you. Most often seen jungle, although occasionally supports or mids. Fairly easy to use.

**Fiora**: Melee AD carry/bruiser with amazing trade potential. She has free sustain off of autoattacks with her passive. Her Q is a dash that can be used twice per cast. She has a huge AS steroid with her E, grants a shield that reflects the first autoattack that hits it. Her ultimate makes her untargettable as she dashes to various champions near her. Her ultimate will always start and end on the same person. Be careful of her damage at level six as it can often net her a kill. By keeping an eye on the first target, you can plan your CC to be sure it hits her. Found top lane. Average difficulty.

**Fizz**: Melee, jumps and makes him untargettable. He can cast it again to jump again and deal damage in a small AoE, or leave it to deal damage in a medium AoE and slow. His ultimate fires a fish that after a small amount of time summons and shark, damaging and knocking up whoever it hits. His damage at level three is very high and should not be underestimated. His E can be used to jump walls. His roaming potential is very good. Mainly found in mid lane. Hard to use.

**Galio**: Melee tanky mage with an AoE lockdown ultimate. His Q is a targetted AoE that slows. His shield grants bonus MR and armour to whoever he chooses, so he works well as a counterpick to AP mids. His ultimate is devastating in teamfights, especially coupled with flash, but can be cancelled with hard CC. Found in mid lane. Fairly difficult to use.

**Gangplank**: A pirate! Yaharr! Also a melee bruiser with good poke and sustain. His Q is a ranged point-click that applies on-hit and, when activated, grants AD and MS to everyone around him. His ultimate is a global AoE that deals random damage over six seconds and slows. He is quite capable of farming against almost any lane. His poke is quite good with Q, especially with Trinity Force. Try to keep his ult in mind, both when playing and playing against him. Found in top lane mostly, although sometimes jungles, mids and supports. Easy to use.

**Garen**: Manaless melee bruiser with good single-target kill potential and great innate tankiness. His Q removes slows and silences upon his next autoattack. His W is a shield that reduces all damage he takes, dealing bonus damage based on how much health you're missing. His passive gives him bonus regen when out of combat. He has high early-game damage with his spin, so beware when trading with him. Try to keep his passive down, as he will regenerate health back very quickly. Found in top lane. Easy to use.

**Gragas**: Melee, good mobility and good sustain. His Q is a targetted AoE that, when triggered again, explodes and deals damage in the area. His W is a brief channel that restores mana over a duration. His E is a dash that slows and damages on impact. His ultimate is a targetted AoE that knocks people back from the centre of the area, and also damages them. Gragas' waveclear and sustain is quite potent, making him a strong laner. His ultimate is excellent for engaging/disengaging. Found in mid lane. Fairly hard to use.

**Graves**: Short-ranged AD carry with strong early game burst damage. His passive grants him armour and MR in combat. His Q is a cone shot which deals more damage if you are close to him. He has a vision-restricting smokescreen and a dash/AS steroid. His ultimate is a skillshot that deals damage to the first person it hits and everyone in a cone behind them. Graves' burst with his Q is very potent, and he can therefore be zoned quite easily. Found in bot lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Hecarim**: Melee bruiser with high mobility and good teamfighting ability. His passive grants him AD based on movement speed. His Q is an AoE that has its cooldown reduced if it hits someone. His W deals a small amount of magic damage over time in an AoE

**Heimerdinger**: Magic damage caster with good poke and heavy reliance on turrets. His Q will place down a turret with indefinite lifespan and average range that shoots at the nearest target. His W fires three rockets at the three nearest targets. His E is a slow-travelling AoE grenade that stuns people in the centre. His ultimate grants bonuses to his skills for a short amount of time: slowing turret shots, and as he has no escapes he is quite vulnerable to ganks. Found in mid lane. Average difficulty.

**Irelia**: Melee bruiser with good sustain and mobility. Her passive gives her tenacity based on how many nearby enemy champions. Her Q is a dash that, and doubles this for 6 (?) seconds on activation, also giving her true damage on her autoattacks. Her E is a stun if they have a higher HP% than you, and a slow if they have lower. Her ultimate gives her four skillshots that heal upon damaging things. Levels 1-4 are her weakest, to try bully her during that time. She scales excellently with attack speed, so AS slows are good tools for reducing her damage output. She is an amazing carry diver. Found in top lane. Average difficulty.

**Janna**: Ranged support with very high utility. Her passive gives MS to everyone on your team. Her Q is a long-ranged knockup skillshot that gains range depending on how long it was charged for. She has a shield that grants AD, also grants Janna bonus MS. Janna's ultimate is a circular knock back that also heals nearby team mates for 3 seconds or until canceled. Her ability to reset teamfights is unparralelled. She works very well with AD carries as she can grant them AD as well as peel for them. Found in bottom lane. Hard to use.

**Jarvan IV**: Melee manly bruiser with good utility, as well as granting the same stats to Jarvan. His ultimate is a targetted jump that creates unpassable terrain around the target for a few seconds. In addition to this, if Jarvan casts his Q and hits his E, he will be pulled to the location of his E and knockup targets along the way. His early game burst is quite high with his EQ combo. His ganks are also very potent if you get caught by the knockup. Found in top and jungle. Average difficulty.

**Jax**: Melee hybrid bruiser with good mobility and amazing 1v1 potential. His passive gives him stacking AS on autoattacks. His Q is a jump that can be used on enemies and allies. His W is a magic-damage autoattack reset. His E is a 2-second spell that dodges all autoattacks during its duration and stuns when it finishes.

1352880951.0,1368jz,For people starting ranked new in Season 3. Please read (My random tips). Long read but worth it!,Dancingg,86,9,68,"Many new people are gonna be hopping into (Pre)Season 3 ranked. But please don't hop in if you don't feel you're ready. It will only lead to ELO loss and you asking the question ""How did I end up here?"".

What I'm about to tell you may seem like common sense but you wouldn't believe the amount of replays I've watched/critiqued on of players who believe they shouldn't be in ""ELO hell"" yet they lack FUNDAMENTALS. Yes that's right. I'd say most level 30 players still lack fundamentals. Let me run down the most common problems people have that cause them to do poorly in games in hopes that maybe you newer ranked players will take heed and make sure to learn these skills/mechanics before jumping into ranked.

- CS/last hitting. Please stop auto attacking guys. You're only hurting yourself/lane. There ARE times where auto attacking is fine but you still have to learn to move around and last hit while pushing the lane up as well as making sure to push up when it's safe/warded. When you auto attack you're going to push the lane up as well as it'll be harder to last hit. Practice last hitting as well as focusing on the enemy. If you have nothing to last hit and they're about to last hit your minion? Go in for some free damage. I think of it this way. If I can farm two whole waves without missing a CS in the early game

- Map awareness. Unskilled players get tunnel visioned and even the best of us get it from time to time. But the less time you're looking at your map is more time for the enemy to move under your radar. Think of how large a ward reveals. It's about 3-4 seconds for them to run into range and out of range again. That's a small window for you to miss and possibly be ganked. When you ward. Keep checking the map. You'll usually be farming anyways so if there's nothing to last hit check your map foo! It's not just wards either. If you see 3 MIA and you're pushing top without any wards. You're going to have a bad time. If you see the enemy go off vision. Always think of what routes they can possibly take (Did they go back and buy? Are they grabbing buffs/objectives? Am I going to get ganked?)

- Lack of wards. Don't rely on your support or jungle to ward. EVERYONE should buy wards (AD is probably the one who's least likely to buy them). This ties into map awareness. Know the good ward spots for the map and I can't tell you how many times I died due to lack of warding and how many times warding has saved my life and even won games.

- Communication. This is a bit harder in solo queue but do your best to speak up. If you know something let the other team know! Always assume they're not paying attention. Of course don't spam ping or anything but when I play top (My main role) if I'm just farming I'm looking at my map as well. I'll sometimes spot the enemy jungler in a ward of ours and I'll ping that for my team so they know the location. This allows them to play around that (ie Play safer/more aggressive)

- STAY ALIVE and DON'T GET GREEDY. Almost every lower ELO game I see has about 20-30 kills/deaths for each side at like the 25 minute mark. Yet the farm count is extremely low. People who are less skilled tend to just focus on kills. It's also the reason people get the bad habit of getting greedy. They'll keep pushing their lane, get ganked again, and their opponent will do the same. It's just trading kills almost what it feels like. Every time you die you're giving the other team gold. And it's not just gold. It's assist gold+lane/item advantage+Chance to get objectives+losing your tower+Their moral going up. Many negative things of dying. If you can stay alive for the most part and at least farm/level up you'll do a lot better than most players.

- Objectives. They mean a lot. I've seen a game where neither team got dragon ONCE. You only think it's 190 gold for yourself but that's 950 gold for your whole team which is a lot. If you get that first dragon and keep the timer? You can keep getting it usually. Also timers. Know them. Baron is 7 minute respawn

- Know your role! A specific example of what I mean is for AD carries. Many times in team fights I'll see an AD jump into a fight and gun for the other AD carry or any other squishy. They proceed to get blown up. AD carries should be whittling down whoevers close and allow the bruisers to smash the other squishies. If you see a squishy near you? Sure it's good to blow him/her up but please don't chase them through a fight. Also know your role's mechanics. For example, overall increasing your DPS. Also keeps your hands warm and ready. Practice this through last hitting as well.

Well that's all I have for now. Maybe I'll update it later if I come up with more. Feel free to add your own too!

1331843285.0,qyalx,You've all heard Dragon is important. Here's why it's important to YOU.,Gstamsharp,81,8,26,"So you've probably been beaten over the head with people telling you how important killing the dragon is on Summoner's Rift

Regardless of this incredibly common knowledge, right?

Wrong! Have you ever been 5 deaths behind and just felt like the game was going to snowball hopelessly against you? Ever been annoyed that your support never has any gold for auras or doesn't buy enough wards? Ever had a jungler who just couldn't gank your lane for the life of him because it was too heavily warded

First of all, bagging the dragon realistically makes your scores even!** Behind 6 kills but got 3 dragons? You're practically winning! Dragon gold alone can help your entire team come back from bad early games, and grabbing a few of them can even make up for a good bit of feeding. The tower point is also important: towers do not respawn. The enemy cannot destroy your tower again for more gold, while you can kill the dragon next time it spawns. Also, the enemy's tower is still there, waiting to hand you a nice stack of gold when you do get around to knocking it over.

Now, and I get it benefits my whole team, but it's still only 190 gold for ME. In reality, you are directly benefiting from it more than you realize. First, that's an extra 190 gold for you and all your teammates to spend on wards and elixers which can give you a sudden upper hand against your enemy. That gold is enough for a pink ward, which might sweep your enemies' wards in your lane and let your jungler pull off that gank you've been begging for all game, for example. Second, and nabbing a few dragons can DRASTICALLY increase their ability to buy items. Your support having enough spare gold to grab that Aegis of the Legion or Zeke's Herald before the big team fight starts can have a huge effect on the outcome! **Every big item your support can afford is like YOU getting extra items for free**--never forget that! That extra gold on other players can and does directly benefit you and your lane.

While against lower skill opponents you may be able to take dragon completely unopposed, you can't argue with being able to bait the enemy into a trap no matter how little credit you give to the dragon.

So next time you get a kill or two, or really ANY TIME YOU ARE EVER BEHIND (or heck, even when you are ahead to cement that lead), grab a team mate or two and take down the dragon. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how many games you can turn around just by paying a little attention to your fire-breathing friend.

**RANKED FAQ**

* **When should I start ranked games?**
 
[Here's a tip: Do NOT start ranked as soon as you hit 30!](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1d8zmx/ranked_faq_for_all_your_ranked_game_questions/c9ocdd3) There is no set number of games or wins over losses in normals that will let you know when to start ranked, adequate rune pages [AD/support/jungle/AP would be my suggestions], and a good attitude [probably the most important]. 

* **How does the league/division system work?**

Leagues are the leagues of League of Legends. They range, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Challenger. Each league is subdivided into five divisions, which are numbered from 1-5 [5 being the lowest division in the league]. 

Starting ranked, while loses will decrease LP. During the ten placement matches, your LP and current league/division are hidden to you while the system sorts you into a league based on your performance. It should be noted that these placement matches have a huge fluctuation in gains and losses of LP, ergo each win or loss may net you +50 or -50 LP respectively. 

* **How do I move in leagues/divisions?**

Once you have gained 100 LP from winning games

To advance leagues, players can not move up more than one league.

To get demoted from a division

Players can not be demoted from a league once they get in

* **What is Match Making Rating [MMR]?**

MMR can be thought of, it is a hidden rating tied to every summoner playing in ranked that determines who the player plays against. Every game a player wins will raise their MMR, while every game they lose will decrease their MMR. Players with a high MMR will gain more LP per win and lose less per loss.

Leagues/divisions do not determine who the player will play against. A player who got boosted to Diamond V may lose 50 games in a row and still maintain his Diamond V status, a Silver III player. 

MMR is invisible to the player

* **Why am I only gaining 1-3 LP per win

There are a few reasons for poor LP gains on wins. Players who have a low MMR will gain less LP per win/lose more LP per loss because the system does not believe the player belongs where he/she is. In addition, will gain less LP as they get closer to 100. Summoners stuck at 99 LP will stay there until the system determines that their MMR is at an adequate level to advance to their promotional series.

* **Okay! I'm in champ select

In champion select

There is a general notion in ranked and draft games that pick order, is greater than call order, in which players say which role[s] they prefer to play. In general, call order is respected in ranked, but when two players compete over the same role, the higher player usually wins due to them being, as believed

In general

* **Help! I win my lane really hard every game but all these f33d3r n00bs are holding me back in Bronze III!**

League of Legends is a team game, but the only true constant in any game played is the player him/herself.

* #3 When stuck in your worse possible role **deal with it**. It happens you may not even have runes for it but it happens

* #4 If someone takes your main role and then does poorly, for all we know you would have gotten stomped worse. All it does is make everyone hate you and the player doing poorly, which guess what makes them play worse.

* #5 If the champion you said you wanted to play gets banned by your first pick, nothing can be done about it anymore so shut up and play something else.

1362515773.0,19q7v7,Learning League of Legends: an analysis of top lane,vyse2,82,14,35,"**Introduction**


Hello summonerschool

 
**Zoning Capabilities**
 

If you have ever watched or played any sort of fighting game, put themselves in danger to keep up with you, or forces their jungler to come top and try to even the lane (which relieves pressure on other lanes and often leads to an uncontested dragon). Champions with strong zoning capabilities abuse the weaknesses of their opponent and dominate them in lane. Almost any top champion can be considered strong at zoning, but the ones that shine are ones that continue to wreak havoc past the laning phase (aka snowballing).
 

Examples of strong champions at zoning – Darius, Akali (post-6), Kayle, Elise
 

**Sustain**
 

Champions can only stay in lane as long as they have a sufficient amount of hp. To avoid going back to base to heal, many champions have abilities that give them an edge in sustain. This is very important as a champion that might have weak zoning capabilities can instead abuse their sustain and simply outlast their opponent, forcing them to go back to base while you push to their tower and deny them creeps while they are gone. 
 

Examples of strong champions at sustaining – Yorick, Cho'gath, Garen, Vladimir
 

**Escape**
 

Top lane is very susceptible to ganks as the distance between towers is much larger than that of the middle lane. Therefore, it’s definitely a good trait to have and could lead to split pushing later in the game. Good escapes include bursts of movement speeds and abilities that mimic flash.
 

Examples of strong champions at escaping – Kennen, Garen, Tryndamere, Renekton, Zed
 

**Consistent Harass**
 

This factor ties in a bit with zoning, you can also push your lane to their tower and make your opponent miss minion kills if they can’t fight back. Champions with low mana cost abilities or ranged attacks are also great at being able to consistently harass.
 

Examples of strong champions at consistent harass – Generally any manaless champion
 

**Last Hitting**
 

Being able to last hit is the most important skill in League of Legends
 

Examples of strong champions at last hitting – Kennen, Jayce, Nasus, Zed
 

**Baiting**
 

One of the best things a top laner can do is force the opposing jungler to top lane while your team takes objectives (bot tower, only to turn around and complete the kill. Using the bushes is crucial to how you bait as it masks your position and forces your opponent to play a guessing game on where you may or may not be. An example would be using a gap closer on a nearby minion wave as an enemy is about to enter the bush or faking out your enemy by running the complete opposite direction than they are expecting (try running past their tower into their jungle and using fog of war to your advantage to avoid others, it's highly effective early on in the game).
 

Examples of strong champions at baiting – Rumble, Teemo
 

**Picking your champion**
 

Now that we have all these defined, last hitting capabilities, or consistent harass. A champion which has a ranged attack (or a ranged skill, such as Rumble) makes for a strong first pick as it is much harder to zone out a champion which doesn’t have to be in melee range to get minion kills. Sustain allows you to outlast your opponent if you happen to be countered. Consistent harass is also a good trait as your opponent shouldn’t be able to push to your tower without taking any sort of damage. An example of a bad first pick would be Gangplank, as he has only one damaging ability and it would only take a champion with consistent damage output to shut him down in lane. Garen would also be a bad first pick as the entire enemy team will be thinking about ways to keep you at a distance and pick accordingly.
 

If you are fortunate enough to pick after their top lane has been determined, such as picking Darius or Elise against melee champions with low early game damage (Irelia, Singed) or picking bursty gap closers against ranged (Jayce, Teemo). This requires some common knowledge and being able to visualize how a matchup will play out while still in champ select. The farther your opponent falls behind, the more likely that ganks will be focused on your lane, allowing your team to secure objectives without much resistance.
 

Occasionally, but you know, pick order &amp;gt; call order). In this position, you have the amazing chance to pick a champion that can abuse any weakness the other team might have. Don’t see a lot of cc? Grab Singed and just run through their whole team. An all AD team? Malphite is a great pick. They don’t have any hard initiates? Pick Jayce and poke their team without retaliation. There is almost always a champion that can both win top lane as well as tear apart the other team, so don’t pass up that opportunity!
 

**Conclusions**
 

I hope this analysis gives more insight as to what makes top lane and how to effectively pick a champion

I'm going to give you tips on how to lane against Singed (top lane)

* Make sure to get the Unyielding Mastery and 3 points into the Magic Resistance it's a MUST against Singed, Flat MR runes, the masteries, and a lot of health potions, this is pretty much going to make you immune to singed's insane damage.

* Shove Singed into his tower before he shoves you.  Singed has a hard time CSing because his Poison isn't that reliable until later levels, free damage is the worst damage to take in lane!  Also buy a ward each time you back, his slow and fling make ganking his lane easy for his jungler so be safe!

* Harass Singed whenever you can

* NEVER fight Singed when his ultimate is on, at level 1 it gives 35 Ability Power, Armor and MR, Health Regen and mana regen, and even movement speed (his favorite stat to walk up and kill you AS WELL AS CROWD CONTROL REDUCTION) and combined with ghost he's a skinny man that can run around the field catch the enemy and poison them all while taking barely any damage, in lane this can pretty hard to deal with but it has 100 second CD so make sure to remember that, he's mostly going to use his ultimate in lane to force you to hug under your tower while he farms between your towers, the best thing to do is clear the minions attacking your tower while he is farming your minions so you won't lose your tower before anything

* NEVER CHASE SINGED (do I need to explain more?) I see countless ganks on singed where he just activates ult and Q and the jungler takes more damage than he did on Singed.  Never chased Singed either

* Punish him for roaming

* Make sure to counteract his spamming of laugh with your laugh

* Singed's Flip is the same range as his Melee Attacks

Summoner School Community is an interesting place to seek help in League. With a wide range of skill level

Many posts that are upvoted are centered around the Hivemind of league, but adjust the way you play to make it work very effectively.

That being said the whole **Think** for yourself was to try and minimize the posts that seem almost unnecessary and often end with one basic reply copying a pro build and then the post is done. A while back I became good friends with a helper of Summoner School. He helped people get better at the game and taught them, but it really didn't help them in the long run. Both him and I knew that.

Flexibility is one of the great things of this game. From choice of champions, everything will change how the game plays out. 

The problem I am trying to essentially get at is that to often posts are made stating ""optimal"" build for a specific champion but every game is different
where I would go ADC Soraka and an Ezreal Support. Even the enemy BOT LANE didn't notice Soraka was AD until about 20 minutes in when I had 7 kills. Our teammates didn't notice until bot said WOAH

What I am hoping comes from this post, posts won't be simply a 1 liner about build or ""optimal"" anything, and that we all sit down and think about WHY things are before we even make a post. Remember your posts effect the OPs way of playing from then on and maybe many more lurkers. At least put thought into it first.

1361940488.0,19b5b7,Low ELO Mechanics,arcitan,81,8,30,"Let me start by saying that I am by no means a highly-skilled player (Silver V represent!)

* **INVADES:** I main jungle, if the enemy was in the banana bush by blue buff, could possibly give away vision of themselves and compromise the invade. Moral of the story here is **DON'T TRUST AUTOPATH!** It's always preferable to move your champ by yourself instead of relying on autopath, because while it may give you a good route 80% of the time, the other 20% you'll be walking right into your grey screen and death timer. Also, be sure you have your priorities straight when you're invading. An invade is to **steal the enemy buffs and deny their jungler, not secure FB. That's an added bonus, and then move down at 1:40. This ensures they have no view on you due to the help they get on wolves / wraiths and you can catch them inside the blue / red buff brush. If done correctly this will hand you a firstblood

* **LANING:** I'm sure you've all read this before, don't just focus entirely on farming as well. Try and find the perfect medium between the two, and while it's not optimal to give up last hits for harass, it's probably better to give up on a few last hits if your jungler is coming in for a gank and you know it will be successful. 

* **GANKS:** Too often I'll walk up to gank a lane, then ping a third time to signal to go in. When you're a laner, typically you'll be initiating the gank to try and bait the enemy into a fight with you. However, don't be too aggressive all of a sudden when your jungler shows up if you usually play passive in lane; **act natural when you're about to be ganked.** While you can usually get away with this at lower ELOs and bait the enemy into an engagement with you, as you play with higher skilled players they will realize that your jungler is nearby and withdraw. This is one of the reasons that Reginald is considered such a dangerous laner; he always plays aggressively as if TheOddOne is always nearby so the enemy mid doesn't know if he actually is or not. This little mind game is how you should be treating your enemy laner when your jungler comes for a gaink. Basically, keep your style of laning consistant when your jungler comes for a gank, you don't to give away that he's nearby. 

* **DON'T ACT, and most likely even games. This applies especially to low ELOs, since mistakes are a lot more prominate in those games. Basically, this means that you should be **reacting to your enemy's mistakes.** Capitalise on your enemy's mistakes, because I'm sure they will make some. Everyone wants to be the guy making ""the plays"", but if you mess up you could throw big time. Instead, try and make plays based on your enemy's failed ones

* **FORCE OBJECTIVES IF YOU'RE AHEAD:** No, and if they try and fight you they will most likely lose, since your team will be ahead. Force dragon fights, contest towers, buffs; anything but the dreaded poke war mid. 

If you've made it this far, and I just wanted to list out what I've observed and learned. Once again, I'm not by any means an amazing League player, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

 **remains neutral within the same topic while giving an action that you can do that very moment**

For League: people say ""ignore your teammates"" ""don't do [stupid play]"" or tell themselves ""dont die"" or ""dont let the turret drop""

Really the likelyhood of failure is way higher in that scenario.

Alternatives: ""focus on yourself""

or neutral actions: ""move somewhere else""

None of this requires anymore game skill than you already have. What it does is make the game skill you already have *that much more efficient*.

1335838538.0,t0uzs,Couple things newer (or weaker) players should learn,Offbeatalchemy,76,4,16,"So I've been doing lessons a lot more recently and I've been finding students all with similar problems when it comes to the game basics so I just thought i'd like to share a quick list of things you can think about next time you play.

* Check your emotions at the door.

I shouldn't say all emotions but mostly negative ones. Most times, you play better. Simple. But if your already upset, mad, fusterated or generally in a fowl mood, playing LoL isn't the key to relaxing, it only makes things worse. It happens to me, my friends, it happens to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to get your mind straight before you hop online. Getting crushed will make your day even worse.

* The key to getting better is learning how to not die

If a pro or high elo player played with you at your elo and has a good game, no one's getting an advantage (besides creeps but i'll talk about that later). But if you manage to kill him without someone killing you, it makes it easier for you to do it again next time. 

Kills aren't everything.

A kill getting away isn't the end of world and actually has it's set of advantages as well. Being out of lane means less creeps. less creeps = less gold + less xp= weaker opponent. If you have some sort of long range skill or he's in a position where you can easily hit him, even better. But your not feeling confident, letting him go is usually the best decision.

And lastly, it's not worth it. Also, try to avoid doing so with less than 400 or so health. Expecting to burst someone down and being bursted down in the process is a very real possibility.


* LEARN TO LAST HIT

Everyone on reddit and guides everywhere says this, learning to last hit as soon as possible will accelerate your play by leaps and bounds.

12 CS is about equal to one kill in gold. With that knowledge in mind

I'm sure there are more comprehensive farming guides but here's a few tips:

   - Pay attention to the minion aggro. Aim for the one minion that's losing health faster than the rest and hit it right before it dies. The more you practice

   - Don't attack the creeps constantly! There's several reasons but the biggest one is it helps you from missing CS. That's why its called ""Last hitting""

   - Masteries have a big part. Carries have a bit of a easier time last hitting without abilities but mages can have a rough time. But whoever I play, grabbing 4 extra AP wont benefit you as much. 4 AP doesn't even equal 4 damage in most cases.

* If you're ahead

""OMG THEY FED ME SO HARD LOL. 7-0 AS DARIUS

Then you die. and you die again. and you die again. Before you know it your 7-8, then you lose.Afterwards, you get that ""egg on your face"" feeling where you let that game slip through your fingers. I see this happen a lot and it even happens to me sometimes.

If you're ahead, force the other team into unfavorable positions but remember, you're not invincible. Most times, if the other team sets it up right, you can easily be put in a position where you can be killed and that's all it takes to turn the tide of a game. At that point, YOUR mistakes determine the fate of the game. Since you're so powerful, you have the most influence on how it progresses

* and lastly

That's what gaming is all about right? Don't beat yourself up too much about a loss or tell yourself you're bad and you'll never get good at this game. That's the first step to quitting, a large amount of your play comes from mindset. Respect others, respect yourself, try to ignore any trolls or bad mannered players, and you'll have a better time playing. And it's usually easier to learn this way as well. Don't take it so seriously, you have all the time in the world to get better at this game. 

I hope this helps some people out there. I know this is kind of lengthy despite me saying it's gonna be short (this took me about an hour to write) and there's A LOT more i didn't talk about when it comes to more advanced tactics and such. But these are the basic mechanics most people should focus on.

If you have any questions, add me on LoL at xAwkwarddd or JK JayKay, I'm usually on one of those 2 accounts giving lessons. If your level 30 but still have questions, add me on IISkitzo. I'll be glad to answer anything you want.

[Episode 2 ~ Pre Game Preparations and The Early Game Effects](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dl-iOQqdj8)
__________________________________________________________


##Lesson Details &amp; Explanations (Optional Read)


This video's primary focus was ""openings""


So what is an opening? An opening in its most basic form is the spending of a base funding
__________________________________________________________


##Openings  

Quick note


##Bead 6 Pot


[](/rejuvenationbead) + [](/healthpotion) **X5** + [](/manapotion) **X1** + [](/sightward)  


This opening is a standard start which maximizes HP Regen to survive in lane and keeps your lane warded for 3 minutes of the laning phase which is long enough to keep a decent CS Score. This can be used defensively and aggressively as demonstrated in the video but is usually used as a defensive start to build into tanky items. Take this opening path if you feel threatened by your opponent and can make use of the reju bead upgrades.  

##Charm Caster  


[](/faeriecharm) + [](/healthpotion) **X4** + [](/manapotion) **X2** + [](/sightward)  

This build was simply suggested as a mana focused version of Bead 6 but it is much more than that

##Cloth 5  


[](/clotharmor) + [](/healthpotion) **X5**  

The best defense is the best offence, sometimes it's better to just wear the nerf pads :)  

##Null &amp; Void  


[](/nullmagicmantle) + [](/healthpotion) **X2**  

This one is very similar to Cloth 5 in regards to consistent damage. If the enemy can do significant amounts of magic damage early then this can really tone down the trades in lane. Teemo

##Long Sword vs Doran's Blade  

Probably the most debated thing in the AD community is which one to take and when, and Life Steal in the form of an on hit effect, what does that mean? That means you need to auto attack minions in order activate the on hit hp regen, and you will get the most use out of it by auto attacking as much as possible. This means you will be shoving the lanes showing aggression throughout most of the laning phase and your support will also need to be aggressive in some manner. It could be an aggressive pick such as Zyra, Thresh, or Leona or they can be vision aggressive by purchasing pink wards and negating enemy vision with something like ""Back To The Shadows"", either way your support needs to be able to defend you as you will most likely be shoving the wave at the enemy tower and simultaneously exposing yourself to ganks. A Long Sword start is effective in a sustain lane where your support can heal you and you want to rush an early Vampiric Scepter to obtain a BloodThirster or Bilgewater Cutglass for Blade of the Ruined King. You also have to think what kind of matchup are you going into
__________________________________________________________

Now obviously there are other starts such as Flask 3 Pot but I'm not going into every single one so try out some of your own and go experimenting in the Item Sets section of your profile
__________________________________________________________  

##Pressure Removal/Redirecting  

I'm sure you've all been in a game before where your lane was difficult to win and you want your jungler to gank for you since you are just flat out getting bullied by your opponent

That's what we want to accomplish with these openings, or answer back by attempting a gank in another lane. This choice isn't easy to make and usually a frustrated laner doesn't help the jungler with his case, so with that logic let's make their life hell. Do your best to pressure your enemy laner and force the jungler into your lane, understand that this is a risk and you shouldn't take this risk without proper vision control, but as long as you can safely pressure your enemy do so. If the jungler comes to gank you then that is good because you instantly remove pressure all around the map, no one needs to worry about the jungler coming into their lane until he is out of vision in your lane. 
__________________________________________________________  

##The Two Methods  

##Aggressive Method  
There isn't much to say here, you want to maximize your damage output as early as possible so the player on the other team is stuck there saying ""there isn't anything I can do about this (Insert Your Champ Here)"". Be sure to ward for ganks and keep the pressure up, remember if it comes down to CS and harass take the CS because that will always help where your harass can be health regen'd back. This comes down to learning matchups in your lane but again I will save that for the next video because there are so many dynamics to every lane matchup.  

##The Brick Wall Method
Imagine a very muscular person, what will happen? They both will end up in serious injury and that's the plan for our enemies, sometimes building defensive stats can be just as good as offensive stats. I demonstrate this in the Shen game play where Riven has a BF Sword and Doran's blade start and still can't even dent my HP bar, and not only that but I can out duel her without a single offensive stat in my runes, masteries or items.  

The way to win a defensive lane is mobility and defense, win your trades.
__________________________________________________________  

##Hitting Tab

I can't stress enough how important the [Tab] button is, after all he can't gank for you if he doesn't know where to go or come from. This can completely change the outcome of your lane and it takes about half a second to press and look at the purchases.

1354100872.0,13xg5a,Season 3 is approaching. Here's some tips for newcomers.,Diclonyuus,84,12,38,"Hello
I'm a player who has been around the 1500/1600 range consistently and I'm here to give you a few tips for if you start ranked or want to play really well in normal games to maximize your performance!

1. Listen to relatively calm music. As a big dnb/metal fan, you can make more rational decisions instead of letting the heat of the moment take over. That kind of decision is always better. [edit: this point is apparently not universally applicable. Still, doesn't hurt to give it a try - it did help me!]

2. Don't set ""I want to win this game"" as your goal. Sometimes, but you win 11, you actually have an elo GAIN, but the 10 games will feel like hell if you weren't the primary losing factor. Try to set other things as your goal! ""I want to get at least 80 creeps per 10 minutes"" is a good example, or ""I want to give not a single kill to the jungler"". Combine these goals. If all your goals are in your own reach and not dependant on your team, you can lose a game and still smile. That also leads to:

3. Stay positive. The best reaction to someone who makes an offensive or provocative statement in your team is to tell them to calm down. Add friendly emoticons! If people see you are still positive even though they just made a huge mistake or were really unlucky, and they keep on raging, just put them on ignore and keep following the goals you set yourself earlier instead of trying to make this person calm down - some people just want to watch the queue burn.
&gt; If it ever happens that someone made you rage so hard that even after the game is over you are still annoyed, there's lots of possibilities to get your mind off that game. Don't queue if you are still annoyed.

4. Stay friendly to everyone

Following that advice and staying positive is also a big part of carrying yourself out of ""elo hell"". I believe the only reason it is called like that is because of the psychological aspect needed to get out of there. I've seen plenty of players who play really well and would definitely be at a higher elo if they reached their best performance every game. However

I wish you the best of luck, except maybe yourself. ",[TIPS],False,self,t5_2t9x3,1354134503.0,default,

1336419788.0,tbmtw,Playing For Objectives: Being a Stronger Team Player,MileyCyrusNo1Fan,76,7,19,"Hello everyone!~ My name is Caleb ""Oskii"" Boese, because I'm still learning the game


**The goal** in League of Legends is pretty simple: you want to blow up the other team's Nexus. Main objective. Priority numero uno. Unfortunately


\#1 Objective in the laning phase is to **get stronger.** You do this through experience (which means levels) and items (which are bought with Gold). A secondary objective is to stop the enemy from getting as strong as you are: for example harassing to deny farm


All your other objectives in the game eventually lead into your #1 priority. Towers, buffs, etc all lead to that essential **""items and experience""** goal that will translate into ""smashing the nexus.""


Now


**Imagine** a perfect game. Not a single CS is missed, and being exactly the same all throughout the game. It's twenty minutes into the game, and they're both at their bench mark of 200 cs. They have their Infinity Edges and are working [and at the same point on] their Phantom Dancers. The same is true across all lanes. The teamfight comes and they all play perfectly. In this situation, in a vacuum everybody dies and neither team accrues any advantage. So you must look to **get things the other team can't have.** If blue team gets a Dragon, purple team can't take a Dragon to compensate for six minutes. Suddenly each member of blue team is up 190 gold. Graves is suddenly skyrocketed to being at 210~ cs, and Corki still has 200. And ONE dragon by 20 minutes isn't what you want. What if blue team had 2 dragons by this point? The team is, giving equal cs and no kills


This is where WORKING AS A TEAM and SECURING OBJECTIVES becomes a **huge deal**. If you've managed to steal the Enemy's first red buff, he might be 20 cs down and have died once. Their midlaner has been without two blues which should have given your midlaner the opportunity to *run train on him,* as well as everyone on your team getting around *570 gold from the Dragons.* Their jungler and mid are down experience from the stolen buffs, and your whole team is in a better spot. Suddenly, your AD Carry has his Infinity Edge and theirs is stuck at BF/Pickaxe. This is when you can comfortably start to *press your advantage* into taking *more objectives* with less of a clear-cut opportunity. In the early-game, you might need to have bottom lane ganked, kill one of their bottom laners, but if you're in a position to be ahead enough that you could challenge the other team 5v5 while fighting dragon then maybe you should be taking those objectives. 


There are too many times in the lower Elo brackets where one team will push the first tower, someone from their team is going to HAVE to clear it, so you should be doing an objective whenever the opportunity arises. I've been in games where people are SO UNSURE of when to do objectives like Baron that they wait an entire minute before deciding whether or not to do it. If you see their AD Carry botlane and your whole team is in position to Baron, why aren't you doing it already? Too often I'll call a Baron, and have my whole team derp around for 45 seconds, and then start the Baron and we get aced. I'm immediately blamed for calling the Baron, even though we nearly completed it and if we'd started 45 seconds earlier it'd be an easy


Another point: **DO NOT BE AFRAID TO MAKE CALLS** in ranked, so I'm often spitting out decisions/calls. We were playing Normal Draft and we were positioning for Baron. Two enemies were in reasonable range. No one was doing anything. I waited for them to get a little too close, pinged about 5 times and screamed ""KILL 'EM"" into Skype. We slaughtered them in no time flat and got a free Baron, proceeding to win the game. The other side of the coin, many a time I've made stupid decisions. I've said ""let's dragon now, come on, come on!"" only to get slaughtered and give up the Dragon. I admit it. I've fucked up. The point is: **a good Leader is not necessarily the one who always makes the correct decision, the next is developing your knowledge and consistently making good calls.** 

*CLG is a terrible anti-example of this.* Just the other day I was watching them play 5s and Saint was trying to make calls. He kept yelling ""push top, it's **when you contradict each other's paths of action that you're going to get fucked.** If there's one thing I could say to CLG it would be ""for once, just listen to every call Saintvicious makes. Never dispute it. Just do it. For an entire game. Let Saintvicious be the voice of the team. If he says: ""HotShot, come push top with me."" HotShot better get his ass top and start pushing. If he makes a bad call, you wait for the next call and follow it, too. After the game, *evaluate how it went.* Realize what might not have been the perfect call and see why. Everyone gains some sense of the game ""Hey, maybe calling that Baron when x was y and z still had his ultimate up when they were in this position-- etc."" Keep in mind, or Jiji, and until you have a unified thought process it's going to be a clusterfuck.**


Which brings me around to my next point: ""But Oskii, too many retards.""


You're right: there *are* bad players, too. And **lots** of them. The point is, until you're trying every single thing you can do to make your team win, you're **not** going to get out of ""Elo hell.""


Here's how I see it: Getting out of ""Elo hell"" is a whole lot like laning phase farming in League of Legends. Each wave there are *six* creeps [siege minions excluded for now]. Hardly ever does anyone get all six, because Annie will blow you up if you try to go near them. At all Elos, **there are creeps you COULD have CS'd**, but either due to bad timing or not paying attention or some horrible demon possessed you, **you missed them.** Say you blanked and missed two of those CS. You got 2 out of 6 on the wave: *not* good. You should've had 4. It's the same way with playing ranked games. **You have six games, two of which could possibly be uncarriable, but until you get EVERY CS you CAN get, you will stay in ""Elo hell.""** You need to win those 4 to move upward. If you don't win those 4


**You're only one person**: you only comprise *20% of the team.* That's not a majority. You do not have the benefit of a pre-made professional team who can elect a leader. You are all in purgatory together, someone is pissed at someone else for ""throwing"" and determining their fate. People **don't like to give up control**.


So what do you do, end up with 3-4 kills by the time I got my first blue buff, the constantly go bottom/top and secure kills. My AD Carry trusted me because I'd gotten him a double kill, and he knew it. Top liked me because I counter ganked and gave him an assist and a kill. Hell, I even kept wards up at all times and called my MIAs diligently even though I try to watch the map and not rely on people calling them. After about 10 minutes of showing people that you're reliable, and a strong player, you should [without being pretentious] be able to start making calls, so if you get a kill bottom and your toplaner is getting ganked by the jungler


I wish you all the best in your endeavours and hope to see you on the Fields of Justice soon!~

 * When ganking as the jungler, Bottom Double bushes, Mid bushes, etc., one of the ideal times to gank is when the enemy laner uses one of his/her primary abilities to either farm or poke. This also applies to when the enemy has one of his/her Summoner Spells down on CD. Remember, timing is important in jungling, but being patient is even more important!

1. Early game effectiveness
2. Mid / late game scaling (ensuring you get there safely and are effective when you get there)
3. Stacking stats that are realistically beneficial to your champion 
4. Using runes efficiently

*(9x) Hp/lvl Yellows* -- 175hp at lvl 18

*(9x) Mr/lvl Blues* -- 24mr at lvl 18

*(3x) Armor Quints* -- 13 flat Armor


This page is my ""I don't know who I'm facing / it's blind pick / I want to be beefy late game"" page for AD.  It's the most efficient way to get bonus HP and still get 13 armor (the same if you were using armor yellows). Prevents squishy ad's from getting blown up right away late game. Also useful for champions that scale well with HP.

**Works well on:** Volibear (top), Jax, Nidalee, Draius, etc.

This is for a more aggressive early / mid game, you should be sure that you will be able to get a kill between level 6 and 10. This page will snowball you like crazy. If you have 2 Dorans + this page vs 2 Dorans on the normal AD page, you will do significantly more damage.

**Works well on:** Aggressive AD carries (Graves, AD Casters (Talon, Kha' Zix, Pantheon), AD Junglers (Nocturne, Skarner), AD top laners (Riven

Everyone should have some variation of this page as well. I believe the Mana Regen yellows become more effective at level 7 than flat ones, because you can pretty much just build 1 Mana item and that's all you need late game. Especially good if you build Athene's.

**Works well on:** Any AP that uses Mana and is played mid. That's about it.

*(9x) Armor Yellows OR (9x) Armor/lvl Yellows OR (9x) HP/lvl yellows*

*(9x) MR Blues* -- 12 flat MR

*(3x) Movement Speed Quints* -- 4.5% flat MS

I use this page for Kat, etc. What yellows you use is completely up to you, just make sure you know what you're doing. The safest by far are Armor yellows. I use AR/lvl on Kat and Ryze because I'm confident with my play style on those two champions. AR/lvl effectively doubles your bonus armor at level 18 from runes alone.

Also pretty good on champions that often build chalice

**Works well on:** AP's that don't use / need Mana Regen, Singed, etc.

**Other tips that may be useful:**

1. Swapping out AD quints for flat HP Regen/5 Quints is effective top lane for harder match ups (Yorick :o ) I really like doing this on Jax and Riven

2. Flat MR is useful vs a high magic damage lane

3. ArPen is usually* better in the jungle. You get guaranteed CS, and a couple tank items. Pretty scary.

4. Be weary of unreliable runes. Unreliable you say? Think about Spell vamp and Lifesteal Quints - you have to be constantly attacking in order to benefit from these. If you are in a situation where you can't attack (zoned) these are useless. HP Regen/5 are much better in that situation. I'm not saying they are bad

5. Flat HP quints are worthless. If you want to be tankyer take 2 AR quint and 1 MR quint. 78 HP doesn't do much for anyone.

1371274671.0,1gdxob,The Solo Queue Playbook: Simple Strategies for Success; part 2 (early laning phase),BlueNoseReindeer,76,11,12,"Yesterday I talked about [L1 strats] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g81my/the_solo_queue_playbook_simple_strategies_for/) which can help your team get off on the right foot, levels 1-5.

**During the early laning phase the most important person is the jungler.** Simply put, you need to understand how each jungler works.

* **Usually** Non-Mainstream junglers like Yi, are rare because they lack early ganking potential unless their enemy is seriously mispositioned. If you have one of these junglers on your team, odds are early ganks aren't going to be successful unless the enemy is pushing hard without ward coverage.

* Snowbally Assassin Junglers like Shaco and Lee Sin, you should be prepared.

* General junglers, and Sej usually look to start ganking around level 3-4 to gank. Make sure you know how each jungler's ganks work so that you can best avoid them.

These are general outlines to give you some context of when junglers hit power levels if you hadn't thought about it before, I will almost always wait until level 4 to get my Nautilus hook when I am jungling, but many people will get it at Level 3, and some may even get it at level 2, depending on how much they want to force a gank.

Don't assume that just because you're going against an Amumu that he wont gank until he hits 4 (AKA: you should probably still get wards); if he can get a good gank off at L2 or L3 that will snowball a lane he's done his job, you can bait out early ganks/wasting time by playing *slightly* more passive. A Lee Sin walking through a ward means you should probably back off immediately (if he has flash he has 3 gapclosers, CC, AND strong burst even at L2 (if he started red), and that's not even considering his teammate(s) in the lane. A Malphite at L2 is significantly less imposing, and if you can get him to waste time thinking a gank opportunity will come up, or bait him into coming in when you are able to disengage (probably causing him to invest a point in his slow

On the same note, because if you can foil their plans early, you will (generally) be able to handle them easily late. For example, as Morgana Mid if my lane is pushing early I may get my shield at L2 or L3 instead of L4 like I prefer to, because I know without it I'm a death waiting to happen. The more factors there are to increase the success of a gank on me (factors like strength of the jungler currently, easy setup from lane opponent, and vision control) the more likely I am to invest in my shield when it comes times to allocate the skill point.

The summoner spell teleport, so I'll wait to discuss them in my next article.

Okay

1. **The Simple Gank.** Jungler gets in position, and don't set something up, so the jungler goes in without a setup and the gank fails. As a jungler, ping to let your teammate know you are there, it makes all the difference. As a laner, let your jungler know **ahead of time** to ping when he gets near, especially if this is a common problem for you (like it used to be for me). The second biggest problem with the simple gank is that sometimes it's not possible for some reason (e.g. the lane is pushed), set a limit on yourself for how long you will stay for a potential gank. As a laner, I could write a whole article on that, focus the person with the least escapes

2. **The Countergank.** One laner knows a gank is coming, this requires wards, and almost always requires a nearby ally (or global ult) that the enemy doesn't bring into their calculations. The key in counterganking is to anticipate their actions, and have your response ready. If you're Ez/Nami/Amumu against a Draven/Leona/Sej, you know that they will initiate with Draven's knock, Leona's pull, or Sej's dive. If you get hit by all of these things your counter won't go well (because you're dead), and mayhem from uncoordination (e.g. Amumu dives their tower while Ez stays back to farm) has a high chance of occurring. Once you get hit initiated on, and Nami heal/slowing shots/speedups, will be your only avantage

3. **Counterjungling.** Counterjungler invades jungler's jungle, Shaco), and at the 7:00 mark no matter what. The important thing to remember in counterjungling is that it isn't a one-man job. The team that is able to help their jungler faster will almost always come out on top of the engage, even if their jungler gets killed/loses a buff (e.g. if Nunu kills Naut, ending up with doublebuffs, but then dies to a laner, that laner will have doublebuffs, it is very easy with a ward to steal the first buff of a jungler with many champions, especially their jungler. Solo lanes start hitting L6 around this time, if the jungler started blue buff

4. **Sneaky Dragon.** This is a rare play, and if it is not possible then be highly aware of potential of the jungler to solo dragon (Nunu, Warwick, Nasus, and Shaco are a few who are very good at this) and keep track of the enemy botlane. If you think they are taking it, odds are you should fight them since dragon will weaken them substantially early on (and you can catch them between indecision and more indecision).

1341229602.0,vx52n,Some constructive criticism about Sunday Night Scrims,adaxus,71,5,52,"I'd like to start out by saying that I love the concept behind Sunday Night Scrims (SNS) and Summoner School.  The idea of helping new players learn about League of Legends and become better at the game through shared knowledge is a great thing

However, rather than letting them try their own thing (e.g. Leona with Clarity).  Then there were times when some organization problems arose and the streamer went on a rage rampage.  Then, in game they were casting a fight, and one of the casters told the streamer to flat out ""shut up"" on stream rather than let him finish what he was talking about.  What really took the cake, though, is when a member of the community messaged the streamer and he responded with a ""go to urban dictionary and look up docking"".  Really?!  *Docking?!  On stream?!*  You're trying to cater to the newer players (some of which may be YOUNG) and you're going to chat about a sexual act like docking on screen?  How **unprofessional**.

I understand that the caveat to watching is that you don't have a ""filter"", basic common courtesy should be somewhat adhered to by the shoutcasters.  Cussing isn't an isn't an issue.  ""That was fucking awesome, dude.  That Malphite ulted the shit out of that Viegar and made him his bitch!""  However, don't demoralize players, rage, etc. in a stream where your goal is to provide somewhat of a ""learning"" environment.  I'd like to also state that anything that Sunday Night Scrims does represents the Summoner School community as well, being that your competition is endorsed by them in the sidebar.

On the upside, once again, a great idea, and I see it having the possibility of becoming a great thing.  The things I listed above, though, are holding it back from reaching that great quality.  If I wanted to watch a stream like the one I saw last night, I'd rather watch some stream where everyone yells at each other and constantly tell eachother to ""fck off noob feeder i afk"".

1375112917.0,1ja5tc,My one tip for improving your ADC play.,OrangeFlavour,93,26,45,"Spam pick **Ashe**.

------

I know some of you may have heard this before because i heard this tip a while back. I ignored it because no-one picked ashe because of her perceived low damage. When i saw her on free week i decided to give her a try ( i know shes only 450ip but i'm stingy).

I found she is incredibly good at improving my mechanics.

- Because you have an extra 50 range (most of the time) on your opponent it really encourages 'range leashing'

- The q slow is really useful at improving your kiting skills

- W is also great at keeping yourself out of danger in teamfights. You can just spam w from the outside untill it is safe to go in. This teaches you patience and when it is safe to start autoing in teamfights.

- E is a great awareness tool

- Because your R is a global it forces you to have map awareness

Also because ashe is quite easy to play mechanically you can focus on your adc mechanics

I feel i play much smarter and more aware when playing ashe.

I would recommend any player to play ashe for a few games before moving on to other adcs.

You win them you'll inevitably climb the ladder. 

It really made me look at the games where I'd get so frustrated at people who left or raged, accept it, on to the next game. 

*EDIT:* Woops! Was on my phone

I should clarify: This is about how to react to a loss, will lose a certain percentage of games. Losses are inevitable, I see this as a way to look at losses and move on from them. As /u/stormravenx put it perhaps this could reduce ladder anxiety and stop people from going on tilt.

1) If you do not have a decent connection that day

2) If you lose a ranked game, get a drink, and then queue up again. It feels great to queue up fresh :)

3) Never, ""Zed, you **** ***** l2p n00b plz report"". This is no way to treat another player. If that was you, how would you feel? Instead, tell him what he did wrong and how he could fix it! Also, you may run into someone who dies a lot in lane and ""feeds"". Still, never give up! Just focus on doing your best. It may not result in a win, it'll be worth it at the end of the day. 

4) Don't focus on countering your lane opponents, some matchup a will be very, very unfavorable, but don't give up). 

5) Learn strong champions. While ANYTHING is viable in solo queue

6) Never give up! This goes along with what I said in point 3. Just because someone on your team gave up first blood or you are losing horribly in lane, and try to not feed your lane opponent. 

7) Farming. Farming is a HUGE aspect to success in League. I main ADC, even though it is SUPER important. 

8) HAVE FUN! I know it can be very stressful, focus on improving, and have fun :)

Hi there, approximately 1k games (minus the occasional game where people refused to, perhaps 1/50 games).

I experimented with several types of invade

First, THE FASTER YOU GO, THE BETTER THE INVADE. When you get to mid immediately step into the brush by their blue (assuming their jungler starts blue, if he starts Red, go to that side). You can get to this bush with 100% safety if you go quickly (unless they have a teleport teemo).
When you get there, go straight into the next brush anyways.

This bush is where you will sit and wait until one of the people on the other team comes to facecheck it. If no one comes by 1:15
Here are some pointers to avoid common mistakes with this invade:
Don't change your level 1 skill for the invade, you're in trouble whether they have CC or not. What's more, exhaust is standard on most supports, and if they exhaust before the enemy flashes, the flash is essentially wasted, because you can catch up to them before exhaust wears off.

Maybe you don't even get a flash for some reason, so going to his red might not be a bad idea...

Only flash after if it guarantees a kill. Sometimes people will walk into the first bush (the one at mid)

If no one facechecks your bush

Don't get greedy. Unless your team comp is infinitely better at a L1 engage (Morg, Trist, Voli v Sona, Ez, Nid, Malp, Mord) don't try to force a 5v5 teamfight at L1. It's very easy to get a kill with this invade if you have one solid form of CC

Make sure everyone is on the same page. Communicate exactly what the plan is in champion select

invade

invade

go straight to mid right away

go in

get kill/flash

leave and leash

leave by 1:15 at latest

get same L1 skill as normal

only flash after if guaranteed kill

gl gents

After that

If you have a style of invade you like, or invading in general, if I can't answer it someone else probably can, so ask away.

* Stopping limit: everybody says that after 2 losses, you may say ""why would I stop at a winning streak?"" Because, as your ELO gets a higher, you get matched against higher ELO players (duh), but you are dangerously close to over confidence. You may count on your teammates being good, but 50 elo (from 3 wins) does not create a huge difference. So, you are equally likely to get a feeder or troll on one of your teammates. The enemy team is higher ELO, from winning 3 games
Not a huge break

* Champion select: You may be a one-role player, trust him.. This is difficult, the trust part I know, but you will be far better off.. That player would probably play a much worse support than you would be, and you can't carry when the support feeds the enemy carry and makes bad plays.. Make your point, say your preffered role but don't be stubborn about it.

* Tri-fore: OK this is not the item. At the start of every game, objectives"". Just to remind the team, just to make it come to their minds. They may already know this, but you didn't lose anything by typing. In the game itself, you remind this to yourself constantly. You got a ward? Perfect, don't facecheck that bush and put that ward down there. It may be a highly middle-of-nowhere brush, but playing safe is better. If you are the jungler, but even if one other mate listens and you get a dragon
Don't forget these 3 words.

* Know two fundamental tactics and enforce it to your team: Every game is different and you can't always stick to these 2 tactics, turtle and farm/split push safely (see the previous tip). If it is even, just do your thing. If you can adapt to the actual situation, you can win more and more games.

* Capitalize on your team's mistakes, but if your bottom is feeding, you should leave it. No need to waste resources as mid and jungler to get them back into game. They need TIME to get back, which you can not give by pushing for them. Defending them is another aspect; but how about you goind the opposite way and defending by being offensive? Get a 3-man kill team roaming, catch them 1 by 1. If they want to take bottom so bad, you take their solo players you take their turrets. If bottom plays defensive, they will get back in around 5 minutes. Leave them be.

* Don't tell: Disable all-chat.. Seriously, don't rat on your teammates. Aside from being reported, why the heck would you want a report AND a lose? In the best case, they ignore you. In the worst; they get more focused on ""making thath b***h pay"" by focusing you. Get rammus, do an actually useful taunt. (related video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-8Q4PM4PXM )

* Make advantage of feeding: Soo you end up 0/6 at first 10 minutes.. What to do? Game is lost, make rest of the team push somewhere. You won't be of use anyway. If they dedicate 2 man to chase you, you waste their time as much as possible. If they go all 5 man on you, well let them enjoy their 170 and laugh as they lose a turret. Bait them into your team. Just troll the enemy team; objectives are more important than kills. (Credit goes to What the Moose for pointing this amazing tactic). Note: this one requires actually determined team members; say what you are doing and win as a team.

Even though people won't realize it, saving ad carry while teamfight, brush control, warding, healing/shielding, engaging... Please understand that support is not having fun or rest in the brush.

With bad AD carry with Good support, change your mind and think again about role of being support.

* **Mordekaiser** - MORDE ES #1 HUEHUEHUEHUE. Strong AP mid and duelist. Not mana dependent
* **Morgana** - One of the best AP mids currently. Built in sustain and good farm ability lead to her dominating a lot of lanes. An amazing ult gives her the edge in teamfights as well. Very strong pick.
* **Nasus** - A passive top laner. He requires a lot of farm to deal huge amounts of damage
* **Nautilus** - A strong jungler. Pretty slow until level 3 or 4

* **Olaf** - Strong top lane and good baiter. Gets stronger the weaker he is

* **Swain** - Great solo laner. Awesome sustain and huge burst. Has great teamfight presence and scales very well. Has the potential to destroy in teamfights
* **Talon** - Strong solo lane assassin. Counters mages because of his silence. Synergizes well with cc machines such as Sejuani. Doesn't have that much potential in team fights
* **Taric** - Very good support. Has a good instastun and heal in lane

* **Vayne** - Very strong AD carry. Weak early game
* **Veigar** - Strong AP mid with HUGE burst. Unfortunately
* **Viktor** - AP caster mid. His shield is not very reliable as it's too slow and by the time it activates he's already taken the bulk of his damage. He does enough damage

* **Volibear** - Very fun jungler. Has pretty good clear times and awesome ganks. Super fun to play and run around as a bear killing people. Very underrated and very VERY fun.

* **Wukong** - Great top lane. Great farm and poke that can lead to him doing well in a lane. Although he doesn't have as much to bring to the table as other top laners
* **Xerath** - Secret op mid. Very high skill cap
* **Xin Zhao** - Strong solo laner with built in sustain. He can jungle relatively well also
* **Yorick** - Amazing solo laner. He can sit in lane all day once he gets his tear, he can't really do much.
* **Ziggs** - Sustained AP caster. Very good range and a high burst with low cooldowns. Can effectively beat out many of the top tier AP mids.
* **Zilean** - Good support and AP mid. His bombs deal a lot of damage

The new jungle doesn't give much more in terms of rewards until a fair bit later into the game. It'll probably be 15-20 minutes before you notice anything. Hunter's Machete has basically countered out the extra strength from the jungle entirely, pulling all clear times closer. Leashing is still important. Even if it's just doing damage. 

Summoner Spells feel more diverse. Barrier is very strong, making Teleport/Ghost/Heal/Cleanse/CV stronger choices overall. I haven't seen anyone brave enough to test Revive yet. It's certainly more viable, but I don't know if that means it worth taking. Despite it being clearly less effective, almost everyone is still taking Flash/Ignite because they're comfortable with it - so I haven't learned as much about this as I'd have liked.

Utility masteries are certainly very interesting, tops, junglers, and tanky midlaners to be going deep into the defensive tree until they nerf it. Also, SpellSword mastery is very efficient for 1 mastery point, but don't try and build around it or anything. It's just efficient, not game-changing. 

Supports feel way better with Sightstone and more passive gold. I got to buy stuff!

Onto new items:

(Ruby) Sightstone is a very nice item. Most teams should probably have 2. Support + mid/top/jungle - whoever is least item-dependant in your team-comp. It's basically the new Heart of Gold.

Crystalline Flask is a really interesting starting item. You can start with Flask + lots of wards and potions, but it gives a great chance to get early ward coverage &amp;/or get through a lane with high harass. It's almost gold-efficient if you sell it after just using all the charges once. Certainly a solid choice.

Almost all junglers will start Machete, and is the best jungle build for quick, cost-efficient stats. 

The default build for ADCs hasn't changed. Including Kog/Cait/ect. Insane single-target damage is simply more valuable than 'fairly high' AoE. 'Hurricane Builds' aren't totally un-viable, much more useful for laning phase.) You would want to go for that build if:

1. They're terrible at diving onto you (no Olaf/Irellia/ect)
2. Your team has enough CC to keep them very close.
3. Your champion has natural synergy with the build
4. You aren't needed to focus a tanky target.

4 here is especially important. Without a carry building single-target-DPS, but there are a **lot** of disadvantages.


Stattik Shiv is basically directly competing with Phantom Dancer. And losing. It's less DPS and some of it is in an AoE (not what you want. Single-target is king). 

Sword of the Divine is great for killing a single target, even with a kill, though, so I don't think it's a good option on carries. Possible item on Fiora, seems solid on Xin and Poppy. Good lategame on Talon/Renekton if you don't need tanky-ness at that point.

Mercurial Scimitar isn't very cost-efficient for an almost 4k gold item (items are usually more efficient as they get more expensive). Since Guardian Angel is weaker lategame, the speed boost is so short it's barely noticeable, IMO. Especially since the first fraction of it is spent telling your character what to do after getting out of a stun. 

Zephyr is a new Nashor's Tooth. Lots of nice stats

Black Cleaver is basically a tank item. Last Whisper is better for your own DPS

Tiamat and its upgrade are certainly more viable. Good AD values and a 1.0 AD ratio on the item make it strong for AD casters even against single targets. The added wave-clear and teamfight AoE is a great bonus. If your team has a Diana/Orianna/Galio/Jarvan to force the enemy team together

Muramana is a really weird item. It gives AD, and generally seems weird. I don't expect this to be used much unless a strong hybrid penetration item comes out. 

Some top laners will like Blade of the Ruined King. It gives nice in-fight sustain and an alternate damage source. Seems solid

Iceborn Gauntlet is overall solid, the slow field is pointless. Against someone without that blink, like Miss Fortune, it's great. Certainly a good situational item.

I haven't seen Ohmwreaker used. Catalyst was nerfed - it's not a natural build-path for anyone, perhaps. The 'make dives everywhere, waltz through stall, change game forever' item some people said it would be? Not at all. It's competing with other items like Warmogs, which could simply make you tank the tower for the extra duration, but those other items are also useful in defending, dragon/baron fights

Spirit Visage is really nice now. Helped by the nerf to ignite. Expect to see it more on champs with good self-sustain in a fight. Renek/Warwick/ect.

Runic Bulwark is really nice. I expect one on most teams if the game goes long enough. For raw tank stats and utility, it's one of the best. 180 MR to the team overall. That's already worth the cost. 

Twin Shadows is a great item. It can find and reveal people you have no vision of. If you think they're doing dragon, and get a nice slow to start a fight, very safely. It's a long cooldown, but I think it's one of the stronger activate items in the game. I see this as a standard pick-up for utility-AP champs such as Maokai.

Archangels used to provide nothing but 'decent' AP in the lategame (since you'd rarely burn through your mana pool in one teamfight), great mana, great AP, great shield. 

Banner of Command is going to be like Promote - uncommon at best.

Linadray's Torment is all about having high base damages and mediocre scaling. Preferably also a way to trigger the double damage. Like Malphite. The Pen works with base damage, though, so it will be stronger late-game. That gives you plenty of chance to get a Crystal Sceptre - you can get this one anyone with solid magic base damages and 'decent' AP scaling. It just ends up being a damage calculation to compare with things like Death-cap and Void-staff. The HP is barely noticeable for an end-game item. 

Shard of True Ice is cool, but I feel the opportunity cost is too high for other roles.

Crucible seems very powerful, it will be in every pro game half a year from now, because it's amazing. Like release Orianna, though, it's not easy to get all that power out of it.

I'm currently Bronze IV and I started playing ranked games some months ago
That one was a bad move

When I realised I was losing 4-5 games in a row every time I tried ranked
I recently found a friend who was Bronze V as well

Here are my tips:

* **Never** EVER **rage**

* Buy **wards**! Every time you back

* Look at your enemies' inventory

* If you fall behind

* In champ select, Fiddlesticks, Orianna, Riven, Alistar, Vayne, Draven)

* Tell your jungler to **start dragon** when he's level 7-8 (6 if Nasus

* If they're **chasing** your support Nidalee in cat form as five

* If you're a jungler, giving your botlane an advantage.

* If you're toplane

* **Time your buffs** and pick them up as soon as they spawn. If you're not the jungler

* **Play with a friend!** Pick two champions with clear synergies and go botlane

* If you're **falling behind**

* ""Hey I'm Gold smurfing let me *put role here*""...Most of the time is bullshit.

* Ban Master Yi. People can't handle him and he will surely get fed early. I know this one is controversial, calling when he's missing).

* If a person calls for support in champ select when you're duoing


Some more questions:

* How to deal with people losing their lane hard (I had a Ryze 0-8 after six minutes yesterday)? I saw that trying to tell things like ""play safe"" or ""buy wards"" doesn't work.

* How to deal with things like...""Omg how do you dare to tell me to buy wards when you're support?""..jungler

* How to convince your jungler to force a dragon? Also

* How to keep your team's morale high even if you're behind? I almost spam ""gj"", when I see people dying, but it doesn't work that good.

* I feel comfortable playing support, you're Wukong, you're tanky, run into them, jump on the adc and press R... Seems like they can't do it so I'm ""ruining"" my KDA initiating the team fights and dying while my team doesn't follow...

1369968589.0,1fdq5o,Lee Sin Tips Compilation,cahker,72,9,50,"I am not a high elo player

* Avoid taking your first skill right away if you're jungling
* You can q wolves over the far wall closer to the fountain. It's faster to walk to the wall and q over from base than to walk through the jungle.
* It is usually wise to delay following up your q until you have done more damage. Resonating strike does execute damage and can negate your enemy's escapes.
* When ganking or killing your lane opponent lead by safegarding to a minon close to the enemy if at all possible. This leaves your q to chase farther and allows you to pull of the Q + R + Q combo.
* If you don't fear a buff steal use Q + Smite + Q to get extra execute damage on the camp.
* Remember that iron will (2nd w) gives a good chunk of health from smiting.
* While running always check for nearby jungle camps. A Q through the wall is a great escape.
* Ward jumps are faster if you smartcast items. I always put my wards in the 5th slot
* With cripple and a ward jump you can usually get behind a champ for a kick and save your flash for when you need it.
* When damaging towers be sure to maximize your passive. Time 2 AAs for every ability that you can use. If the enemy is coming save your w to escape.
* Don't chase singed
* Again
* If you are next to a wave when leaving the base W farther up to get to lane faster.
* Lee Sin has two good reveals with E and Q. Fight with Teemo
* If you know that you're going to get caught in lane try to Q the back line of enemy minions before the enemy players get in range. Run the opposite direction or into a bush to draw them away from your marked minion then Q at the last second. With ward jumps
* Make sure you don't Q + W poke when you could be hard CC'd. It's a good idea to go over who can catch you when you load into the game
* If you're stuck in a 2v1 in the jungle, kick them over the wall, and follow with resonating strike. Coolest way to get out of sticky situations, even if it only works 10% of the time.
* You can gank mid by throwing you Q from the enemy wraith camp into the enemy mid and then follow up by kicking them out of their tower. You can also use this on minions after counter jungling.
* If your queuing with a mid tell them to stand on one side of mid lane while you stand in the opposite bush. The other laner will naturally move closer to you. Also ask about ward placement
* Always consider counter ganking even when your laner has died. With a safeguard and a flash you can easily catch low-health enemies who don't immediately back off.
* If you are forced back in lane

1364772818.0,1bdxg1,Tips for Success: ADC Positioning,MarcAurelius,71,13,14,"Hey guys! INA Aurelius here again with another guide for my ""Tips for Success"" mini guide series! And this time

[](/ashe)  [](/caitlyn) [](/corki) [](/draven) [](/ezreal) [](/graves) [](/missfortune) [](/sivir) [](/tristana) [](/twitch) [](/urgot) [](/varus) [](/vayne)

**Original PM from PermanentDmg**

&gt; Yeah

**Reply** - This is very true, it all comes down to **evaluating the situation, correctly, and then acting appropriately on it** e.g. Don't engage as Vayne to kill an Ezreal w/ only 100 HP left when his full team is there with him and you have no back-up from your team, which may be on it's way or in another lane too far away to help. 

**Key Concepts of Positioning as the ADC**

When it comes to the very complex mechanic of positioning

 * Be excessively **aware** of all of your surroundings, so that you die since the enemy team was in a nearby bush. 

 * **Think** beforehand of everything you do, and determine who is going to attempt to kill you first, e.g. you see an enemy Katarina with a DFG, your assumption here is that she'll be focusing you down first, so you plan your actions ahead of time, e.g. you wait for Katarina to put herself in a bad position since you'll be **positioning** yourself out of range for Katarina's kit and DFG range, **all** while fighting in the teamfight.

 * Learn how to **kite** the **entire** enemy team, but it's not that hard if you know your champion well enough, i.e. ranges, and know your enemy well enough. I know it's probably the most difficult thing in League of Legends, but once mastered, it is a devastating mechanic to know! Everybody remembers the MLG in Dallas, TX with MRN vs CLG, Doublelift, Irelia stun, in spite of that

 * Know your DMG potential as whoever/whatever ADC you're playing

 * Position yourself in a way in which it would make the enemy team extremely difficult to get to you, so ideally you'd want to stay somewhere remotely behind or near her, while being close enough to focus enemy targets.

 * Understand when it is appropriate to ""jump"" into the fray of the 5v5 teamfight to secure a kill that is either escaping on low HP or is about to kill one of our teammates and you're able to burst him/her down. This can be the difference between, but the overall outcome of the teamfight, i.e. your team wins or loses, for it may not be worth Arcane Shifting in as Ezreal just to kill the Irelia running away with 50 HP when the rest of her team is still &gt;50% HP or not fleeing with her for they may notice you and kill you instantly, meaning for your team, that their #1 DMG source is now dead and they have to retreat. Having good decision making is key guys, don't start a game without it.

1368625915.0,1edres,"[Mini Guide] ""The Big Four"" Amumu, Shen, Malphite &amp; Blitzcrank",MarcAurelius,73,40

Today's guide is a requested guide from /u/taion809 about Why ""The Big Four, Malphite, and Blitzcrank, are banned and why they dominate in the lower ELOs. I hope everyone enjoys this guide, feel free to comment below like always, thanks ahead guys!

**Note:** I have a friend of mine, helping me with this guide, so as a thank you for the support, I'm giving him a shoutout! Keep it up, man! You're doing well! 

**Notes of Consideration/Explanation**

 * These champions get picked if left opened by any majority of players, or being of the complete opposite, by knowing absolutely nothing of the champion, mainly in lower ELOs, as they just end up not performing well at all, i.e. Shen who builds AP and doesn't utilize his Ult or kit to it's maximum effect.

 * *Feeder's Mentality:* According to some PMs and vouches by various IRL friends, a certain mentality within lower ELO players to purposely feed the enemy, which happens to be playing one of the Big Four, so that he may ""show"" the rest of his team why one should always ban that certain champion. (Now I'm not purely sure on if this is 100% true, for when I play Draft or Ranked, my bans are purely based upon what my team and I can't handle, e.g. Top Lane says he can't play against and Singed, my bans are usually against Champions that take advantage of people who do not have good Map Awareness, etc.)

**The Why &amp; How**

##Shen [](/shen)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * Shen's ultimate

 * He is considered strong due to the fact that he is innately tanky and that he out-tanks all other tanks before him

 * His in-lane harass is primarily Magic DMG, and since Shen is one of the few champions who can absolutely stay in lane and play safely with just a Doran's Shield start, and since he's Energy based, the harass will continue on for ages.

 * He is nearly impervious to 1v2 tower dives for, thanks to his W Shield, and E Taunt AA/Ability cancellation. 

 * He is a very strong splitpusher thanks to both his kit, which allows him to clear much quicker.

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Punish him for split pushing if you can, if doesn't have those times, his clear speed is abysmal, so take advantage of that by heading up to stop him, if not at least push him away. 

 * Bait him into his Ultimate when you are ready for it. Any form of hard CC can stop him from teleporting. 

 * If you're top against a Shen and he happens to use his Ultimate to save someone

 * Know your DMG potential with your respective champion

 * Baiting his W will allow you ""free DMG"" in which he can't shield

 * Attempt to force him to farm using only Qs

 * Do not play champions against him that have no innate ranged ability, will just kite you down, e.g. champions like Riven, Xin Zhao, etc. 

##Malphite [](/malphite)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * He scales off of pure defensive stats, and his Passive shield. 

 * He has a very strong initiating spell that applies hard CC in which takes advantage of lower ELO players:

  * Reaction speed

  * Map Awareness

  * ADCs positioning, (think Doubelift Vayne style)

 * Has a very strong transition throughout all phases thanks to his innate tankiness and Magic DMG harass.

 * His E plus the active from Randuin's Omen will make your AD AA based champions practically useless during teamfights, takes advantage of poor positioning, if the ADC happens to be within Randuin's Active range. 

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Building early MR against him will help mitigate his DMG potential

 * Constantly applying AA pressure if you're ranged or if you're able to out trade him

 * Applying enough pressure to Malphite early on to as-cert lane dominance will force him to farm with Qs from afar

 * Malphite is countered by champions that deal % DMG to him, etc., or champions that are able to out burst/DPS his Shield during early game, e.g. Kayle, Jax, Renekton, etc.

 * If you're playing as the ADC on your team, also, asking your Support or Jungler to peel for you would be the most ideal solution. 

##Amumu [](/amumu)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * People at lower ELOs don't Counter Jungle as much as I'd like them to

 * He is easy to pick up and play

 * Lower ELO players have yet acquired the skills to dodge skill shots

 * He is a considerably strong DPS champion that is innately tanky that is able to deal AoE DMG. 

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Counter Jungling him will shut him down, use that to your advantage. 

 * Warding  +  good map awareness prevents his long range ganks. 

 * Remember that Amumu generally has no follow up after his Q + R combo

 * Forcing him to waste his Ultimate to escape may be ideal.

 * He's very squishy during the early stages of the game

 * Get your team to work together

 * Remember that his Ult doesn't stop channeled spells

##Blitzcrank [](/blitzcrank)

**Why He's Strong:** 

 * As a CC machine

 * His Q has a pretty short cooldown and its hit-box is very very silly.  

 * His high utility makes him strong during the whole game with little items. 

 * He is able to bait well

**How to Deal with Him:** 

 * Stay behind your minions!

 * Even with his Passive, so use that to your advantage, if you know you have enough DMG potential to kill him regardless of his shield, for I've seen many Blitzcrank players who were too complacent thanks to his/her Passive shield. 

 * Ward so he doesn't have bush control. 

 * Pick an aggressive zoning support against him, Zyra, etc., Passive supports, e.g. Sona, Soraka, don't fair well against him. 

 * It is generally a good idea to engage versus him while his hook is on CD. 

 * Keep moving

1364872405.0,1bhoyr,Solo Queue Mindsets: Becoming a better player,vyse2,72,12,34,"Hi r/summonerschool! I wrote another article that you guys might enjoy

[Link to original post!](http://learning-league.blogspot.com/2013/04/solo-queue-mindsets.html)


**Introduction**


If you have been exposed to any sort of League community, which I think touches on some of the more obvious reasons why people are stuck at their level. Today, I wanted to look at some mindsets you can get into in order to improve with some of my own personal experience.


**Mindsets**


***1) You are the worst player on your team.***


This is a mindset I held for a very long time, you won't be getting lazy because you feel like you must carry your team or that your team has a better comp.


***2) Every game should be played like a promotion series game***


Back in my Super Smash Brothers Melee days


I stomped the hell out of him, I had an underlying thought that I was not gaining anything by playing against this person as there was nothing on the line. I wasn't gaining any sort of skill since I was a better player than him and I wasn't going any further in a bracket because it was just a friendly. Then once the tournament started, my mindset had shifted without me realizing it. I had a lot to lose (being sent to loser bracket, reputation for losing to someone worse than me) and a bracket advancement to gain.


So what does this mean in League? I don't know about the general populace, just a number that goes up and down. So with regards to myself, I need to find some outside motivation to make myself work harder in those games in between promotion series. Desire to reach challenger tier, wanting to be higher rated than a rival, etc.


***3) Place blame in yourself instead of others***


Everyone has been in a game where you are performing well while the rest of your team performs poorly. It could be in the form of being outplayed or someone trolling, blaming people, that sort of stuff. This is probably the biggest reason why people never improve; they see their teammates as inhibiting their rise to the top rather than their own skill.


If you want to get a higher elo, look at ways that you might have been able to change that. Search for common things your opponents do and find a way to exploit them. When I was first doing ranked, I found that mid lanes almost always follow their opponent if they disappear into the river. So I took advantage of that and baited them into nearby bushes and destroyed them.


I feel like jungling is a great way to gain elo. The whole map is your playground and if you learn how to counter jungle at your elo, etc etc. If you are just farming and ganking normally, I guarantee there is more you could be doing to impact the game.


***4) Play like you are tutoring / someone is shoutcasting you***


This is something every player can start doing immediately. When you play, look at the team compositions and talk about why you are choosing X champion and how it helps your team or does well against the other team. In game, talk about what item paths you will be going for and why, commentate on your play and the thought process behind it, and your role in team fights. Or if you don't want to talk about yourself in first person, imagine that someone is shoutcasting your match and they are following only you.


The idea behind this is that it makes you play smarter. If you are speaking aloud

My current plan (topics which would each take a separate post):

* **Supports** - Builds, How to Play with an AD Carry, Aggression in lane and How to Receive Ganks

* **How to Figure out any Champion** - General mechanics and Item Builds

* **Theorycrafting 101** - Basic item Building and Basic Team Composition Building

* **Winning a Lane** - Comparing Mechanics

* **How to win a game** - Basics on Teamwork, Counter Strategies, How to respond to a fed enemy, How to keep yourself or your teammates fed

If there no love for a particular subject or if there is something not on the list that you want feel free to post! If you feel this would be better suited in Summoner School or the general League of legends sub Reddit just say. Also for any reason someone would like to collaborate with me (i have no idea why xD) on a particular subject just ask and I will most likely say yes.

I will start writing these after tomorrow and see the response to determine whether or not I should continue from the feedback. (or wont even start if the general response to this is horrific).

**MASTERIES**: I like 21-9-0 because it lets you kill more shit which is what wolf is about. Grab penetration in offence, 4 in that other thing on the left hand side and Veteran's Scars. [This](http://imgur.com/ryrMo) is an actual picture of the mastery page I run.

**STARTING ITEMS**: I usually like to open with WHATEVER I FUCKING WANT because you're a wolf with a billion sustain but no seriously **boots and three fucking pots** would be a good start. Up to you whether you go HP or mana but I usually like 2 HP and 1 mana. This lets you get health back and shit but you can also get mana back and shit which is boss.

**SUMMONERS**: SMITE AND FLASH. Don't be a dumb fuck and be like 'y0 mang TRM is da best and WW can jungel without smite so i wont take it' NO TRM SUCKS AND YOU NEED SMITE! Also, you can run ghost, exhaust or even ignite if you want.

**SKILL ORDER**: Once again w/e you want even start E if you want to YOLO. My preferred skill order, followed by skilling **R&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;E**. I do this because I always take extended route with WW so wolves first is good, and the AS helps you kill these more than Q does. 

**ROUTE**: I DO WOLVES BLUE WRAITHS GOLEMS RED WRAITHS AND THEN FARM UNTIL 6 OR MADRED'S RAZORS WHATEVER.

**ITEM BUILD**: I deliberately left this late because no matter what

**Wriggle's Lantern** is fucking bitchin on wolfman because it gives him amazing sustain and epic control of buffs and dragon. Also a free ward HEY THATS AWESOME and some AD because dat ult has 20% scaling. I will usually make Wriggle's my first item because he can solo dragon so early lol. Late game you can sell that shit for like a BT or something but sometimes I keep it because its good for Baron control.

Early game you can choose from a lot of boots BUT IF YOU BUY ZERK'S I WILL LITERALLY KILL YOU, Mobi if you really wanna get in range of dat ulti (good if you gank all the time), or Merc's if you I dunno need CC reduction and MR. I typically go either Sorc's or Merc's as these are the ones you will want for late-game for damage and tankiness respectively. 

My core late game WW build consists of boots (either **Sorc's** or **Mercury Treads**), Wit's End and Spirit Visage**. Therefore, I will want to be working towards this build the whole time. I will always get one **Kindlegem** during the early stages of the game as it gets you a bit tankier and also gives you **CDR WHICH YOU FUCKING LOVE** seriously CDR is sooooo good on Wick which is why I try to max it out every game. Also Kindlegem builds into SV and Zeke's, both of which are awesome on wolfman. **Glacial Shroud** is an excellent mid-game item as it gives you a lot of what you need, and you'll keep it until end game. **Wit's End** is another item you'll be keeping until the end of the game and you scale well with it, AS and MR and MORE MR and ON HIT SWEET MARY THANK YOU! Another item that ain't half bad is **Haunting Guise**, and its well worth considering if you're fed and need some more damage. **Hexdrinker** ain't bad either you will be deceptively tanky and your ult gains damage too. Finally I love getting **Guardian Angel** on WW as it gives him resists and shit and then you get back up and kill more shit. Oh and about **Spirit Visage** its dope as shit but I usually sell it late game for some other shit. Oh Aegis is good as well.

I ceebs explaining the billion other item choices

**GENERICWICK**: Mercury Treads, Wit's End, Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel.

**THEY HAVE TONS OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE WICK**: Mercury Treads, Randuin's Omen, Sunfire Cape, Guardian Angel.

**THEY HAVE TONS OF MAGIC DAMAGE WICK**: Mercury Treads, Spirit Visage, Maw of Malmortius, Guardian Angel.

**SUPPORT AURA WICK**: Mercury Treads, Zeke's Herald, Shurelya's Reverie (ohhhh full CDR bitch), MR item of your choice (QSS, Maw, Wit's, SV, FoN

**I DON'T LIKE DYING WICK**: Mercury Treads, Randuin's Omen, Force of Nature, Guardian Angel.

**TONS OF DAMAGE WICK**: Sorcerer's Shoes, Maw of Malmortius, Frozen Heart, Guardian Angel.

**WTFWICK**: Sorcerer's Shoes, Abyssal Sceptre, Frozen Heart, Guinsoo's Rageblade. Honestly, try this sometime. You might end up dying in a couple of seconds, but you'll do hella damage, and WQR gets you up to full Rageblade stacks IIRC.

**HOW DO I PLAY WICK** well its simple. Wick is super easy to play here's what you do. Jump on shit and press everything. Early game, turn on E, hit W as you come out of ult, Q and chase. If you can, walk into Q range, hit Q, ult and by the time you come out of it Q should be up soon after. You can also gank pre-6 if you have red buff. 

Remember you have **BEAST DRAGON CONTROL** and you can solo it as soon as you get Madred's

TEAMFIGHTS WOO ult the highest threat simple as that I usually like ulting people who can do shitloads of damage like the AD and AP carries. Spam W because it helps your team members like a boss, so be prepared for that but that's okay because it means they're not CCing your AD carry. Every elixir is awesome on Wick so get them all, especially blue pot because it gives you CDR.

That's it! Hope the guide helped

1342424798.0,wmumt,Tip for everyone: Learn how to neutralize counterpicks,PlayOnSunday,62,4,22,"A quick tip here as I make the rise up through ranked.

There is a huge stress on counterpicking, it's great to know how to neutralize their advantage.

An example myself. I love playing Annie, and I can do consistently well with her. I've also had first pick my last few games, and since I was able to go mid, I picked Annie. Two of those games, I got ""counterpicked"" by a Kassadin and LeBlanc. This is where knowing how to counter them comes in.

1) Take teleport instead of ignite. You won't be on the offensive tons

2) Try to invade blue if you have an Ali or good hard CC and they don't. Annie has a decent

3) Trade whenever they have big moves on CD

4) Most importantly, and with a potion, you WILL win the lane.

1362019632.0,19ddrt,An in-depth look at jungling - Wall of text (Noob friendly),CG_liNk,65,9,20,"Hello fellow Redditors. This post is based on simple information

A) Invading.

A.2) Protecting your own jungle.

B) Ganking.

C) Counter-jungling.

D) Warding.

E) When to take buffs/objectives.

F) Taking the blame for everything.

EDIT: Added 2 more sections.

G) Picking your champion.

H) Picking the right items.

Let's get started!..

--&gt;

**A)** As a jungler, and then proceed to lose 3 of your teammates.

If you want to invade, then go for it. Get your support to drop down their explorer ward, and then just run them over.

**A.2)** If you sucessfully achieve to steal the enemy blue/red buff, I'll steal something from you.""

If I ever manage to steal a buff from the enemy team

**B)** Choosing what lanes to gank can actually be pretty hard. This is hard to understand for most laners

As a jungler, right eye on minimap and left eye on the screen.

As a jungler your also have the option to make the other team rage like all hell. I personally tend to camp a lane to the amount where they aren't worth more than 30 gold on assists. It's not for the money, nice jungler I have.. Doesn't wanna gank when I get camped, GG -.-"" - This is the ultimate goal. It will create a terrible tention between that lane and the rest of it's team.

**C)** Counter-jungling is a good option

I strongly advise you to not counter jungle if you don't have vision of the enemy jungler

**D)** Very short section. Communicating with your support about warding is a good idea. Make a deal with him. He wards dragon and enemy blue

**E)** ""GO BARON GUYS, and I'd like to share it.

I will never call for a baron unless we killed 2 of the enemies. It's so incredibly easy to stall out a baron

**F)** This probarbly doesn't sound like a nice section

1: No one gives the support credit.

2: Everyone blames their jungler for everything.

As a main jungler, even tho he didn't pick up a ward after getting killed from an early gank.

Calling them out on their lack of warding or skill is the stupidest thing you can do. If someone rages at me for the above mentioned reason I always say stuff like; ""Sorry man

I always take the blame for everything that happens, if someone tells me ""Fuck you, I hope your mom dies and your sister gets raped"" I will instantly mute them. Behavior like that is not fair, and you should not put up with that.

**G)** If your new to the jungle, and high sustain.

In this meta, Jax, Mundo and Amumu are all very strong and safe picks. I personally main Volibear, but find what fits you best.

**H)** Communicating with your support and occasionally yout other lanes about items

Almost every single support will pick up the Aegis of the legion and build it into Runic, is just not worth it.

A very strong and solid build as a jungler can look like:

* Spirit of the Elder Lizard or Spirit of the Spectral Wraith (Depending on being AD or AP)

* Randuins Omen

* Spirit Visage

* Sunfire Cape

* Warmogs Armor

* Choice boots. 

As a jungler, your team will most likely win the fight.


If there is a section anyone would like to know more about, but this is pretty much all the basic information you need to know about jungling.

Hope you guys like this

// Peace. :)

1361398738.0,18ww4e,Tips to help improve your adc play(long post),hamsword,65,10,24,"Hi my name is hamsword and I have mained adc since i started playing this game


* Attack moving, in general this mechanic helps with you not mis-microing all the time too. If you hit A then left click it helps with kiting, csing, and makes it so you don't walk back into to their bruisers when trying to kite away from them and missing your right click. I never really right click to attack anymore because it leaves a lot of room to mess up. It seems pretty obvious but i have a plat friend who didnt even know a-clicking was a thing. its much like stutter stepping marines in sc2, and is probably the most useful of all mechanics in the game.


* practice every adc when you play. every day when I get on I play every adc in a certain order(if I have team practice that day) this increases your knowledge of all other adcs

* keeping track of enemy's health pots/items. this is a huge thing in any lane, you can force them out of lane much easier. If you have a bf sword and vamp and they just have vamp that means you can be much more aggressive to them since you will out trade them. Often times I ask my support how many health pots the enemy adc has so we can know when to go in on them. 


* always ward the lane bush if you plan to engage, and since I play vayne a lot it really screws them over.


* In solo que, supporting is very hard to do correctly, and if you know your lane in and out it will help alot. notice how people like loccodocco are now adcing, when they were support mains, and aphro now playing support its because they know all angles of their lane. 


* Bruisers, so you will know when most of them will dive you and how you can kite them, each bruiser has its own gap closers that they will use to catch you at certain times, and knowing the timings for when you should use your escape is key, or how to kite that certain bruiser. for example, xin will always use his e&gt;w&gt;q and will usually flash to get the knockup if its up, so using your escape after the knockup is usually the best option(my team keeps flash timers for situations like that) 


* ward timers can help a lot for ganks


* If you are having trouble in solo que, but now I play with a competitive team, and my skill level has gone up by a ton since I started playing in a team setting. 


* Do not go in If the enemy jungler has been mia for a long time, and there are two types of junglers, junglers that camp top, and junglers that camp bot and about 75% of junglers show their face bot the most. also if they lane gank once, they WILL lane gank again. 


* Knowing how to deal with lane swaps, ask your top if he can handle it, if he can, PUSH HARD AND FAST. If you take that first turret in a lane swap you will have a huge advantage, and it helps your top laner who is behind in farm catch up. sacraficing farm to push that turret isn't a terrible thing, but you need to push better then they can or you will lose the lane swap, a lot of teams can't handle lane swaps on the 5s ladder so there are a select few who do it every game and win by doing so. 


* FARM FARM FARM, my support does like 90% of the work in lane, and I do most of the work late game, its a mutual understanding. I don't even really look at my map when my support is there, I focus on the enemy and my farm, my beautiful beautiful creeps that give me lots of gold. he asks me if I want to go in, and i say yes or no, i run. he says lets poke hard here


* Snowballing your lane, make that jungler waste his time in your lane, set the enemy adc behind and really press your advantage, you will poke them for way more then they will you, and you will make them lose more and more farm. 


* Knowing how and when to poke in lane, you always watch your creeps as well as theirs so you know when they will lose a creep from your aggression, or if you get poke on them they can lose a health potion for a creep and a health potion is 35 gold while minions give you much less, especially casters. coordinating poke with your support is very big in lane when with a sona or lulu, because you can really punish the enemy adc. 


bot lane is A lane that is very hard to master after learning. These are a bunch minor mechanics like this that can sway the lane in your favor

1361247083.0,18sqvr,"RE: All current and future Mordekaisers out there, everything you need to know about your ghost.",carpaltaser,64,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/18sqvr/re_all_current_and_future_mordekaisers_out_there/, so there

**1. Get the ghost**
First things first

*low enough hp that ult will guaranteed finish them off  

*high priority target  

*the guy who's focusing you / someone with a lot of hp if you're gettin' messed up.  

You know the basics, etc.  What doesn't show up in the tooltips is that nobody on the enemy team wants to kill your ghost.  It's pretty beefy and it knows no fear. often times if it shows up in the middle of the teamfight, no one else will notice it except for you. (voice chatting with people helps them know to charge forward because got that ezreal ghost, or to retreat because you have failed.) Since people don't want to attack your ghost, when they see it ambling towards them, they tend to run. Maybe it's fear, or they're too busy at the moment, idk. Regardless it brings me to my next point.  

**2. Who to ult**
Keep ignoring any teammates that don't like your pick of ghost buddy. There aren't any do-overs so make the most of who you got. And contrary to popular belief, try to get that carry. A carry ghost is phenomenal and I shouldn't have to explain why, but many other champs have their moments. Melee dps are fantastic ghosts. They hit almost as hard as the carry, and they're a lot easier to ghostify. And once you have a ghost, you make the enemy notice regardless of who it is.  

Imagine you're graves. You're doing great, and you've almost got that last whisper. Now imagine a riven is running at you, except this riven is different.  This riven has 2.4k health, no reason to live, and no one is peeling her off of you. She's not using skills so you've still got a good chance, but this riven gives no gold when you bring her down, and the enemy still has five champions left. Maybe you should just walk away from this one

Now take into consideration towers, so champions like Nautilus (passive snare) and Jax (passive aspeed) and Yi (passive asshole) are great at hitting objectives. Not to mention ghost anivia turns into a ghost egg and that's just fking awesome.  The only guys left are AP carries and supports. Neither are great, but hey, Morde's ult is good damage, if that's what it's gonna take to kill their mid? Go for it. Not to mention early game, everyone's autos are about the same anyways. Supports... no. Don't... don't do it. If they're all alone and you feel like you could use some company, then sure. Then have him/her stand in a bush and keep watch somewhere while you go do more important things.  

**3. My ghost is so dumb D:**
He's not dumb. You're dumb. How does that feel? Ok I'll admit

*Tip 1*: Set it and forget it. If you can Alt+right click a good target

*Tip 2*: Live vicariously in Co-op. When you're in a practice game, maybe last hitting for you, kiting a bot. You could actually play annie and just practice with Tibbers. Also practice diving towers with your ghost. That ghost gets away with so much shit, and you get all the blame. Tower aggro, baron aggro, reports.  

*Tip 3*: This tip is pretty high level, morde ult becomes gamebreaking. Practice playing AD carry. Get good at moving between attacks, positioning, orb-walking, anything you can. Then when you using an AD carry as a ghost, you can go hide in a corner somewhere while your AD carry prowess cleans up the fight. I'm not joking. If you get the AD with your ult, move Mordekaiser to a safe position in the fight. That ghost is 90% of your dps and he dies when you do.  

Guys I love mordekaiser. Dude rocks. If I can even help one of you guys have a better game with him, let me know.

1343401679.0,x9037,"I wanna talk about the meta, and prioritizing fun over winning, and inner-team conflict.",callmesuspect,66,75, and how it can sometimes ruin games for people.

I want to start off by saying that I don't post a lot around here, well, up until yesterday anyways...

I asked 4 people in the chat for join me for a 5v5 blind pick, because instantly, someone said ""wtf? blind pick?"" which should have been my first red flag, I should have dodged there. 

But, that's what I said in the chat...."" after this I proceeded to pick volibear with the intention of playing him bruiser bot, a tatic I employ often with him, it's extremely easy to feed your AD Carry with volibear bot.

After picking volibear, and to calm down. The person who had called TOP switched to kayle and said ""GUESS I'M SUPPORT"" to which I replied ""No... I can't solo top would you please go back to jax?""

Anyways. the game starts and he does switch back to jax. Everything is going pretty well for a bit. I'd like to pause and mention that everyone who I invited to this game had roughly 100 wins under their belt

So I started to feed vayne. Flipped caitlyn into her a couple times and at the 10 minute mark she has 2 kills and I've died once. Not too bad. This entire time the entire team was complaining about what a bad player I was for not going support

Well, you've already lost. I pleaded for them to work as a team and stop complaining as it wouldn't solve anything, but they wouldn't stick together, and jungle fiddle just kept gankin' and killin'

I finished the game 3/8/16, that same person complained about me dying. Oh, sorry for saving you, the AD carry, instead of me, the bruiser tank support guy. The entire rest of my team surrendered.

Aatrox

**Annie**

*We’ve made some changes to Tibbers to make him a tankier and more threatening presence in late game team fights beyond his initial burst damage.*

Summon: Tibbers

&gt;Tibbers’ Health increased to 1200/2100/3000 from 1200/1600/2000  
Tibbers’ Magic Resist increased to 30/50/70 from 25/45/65  
Mana cost reduced to 100 at all ranks from 125/175/225  

---
**Ashe**

*This change allows Ashe players to use her passive in more strategic ways beyond a level one poke or incidental crit.*

Focus

&gt;Ashe now gains 3/4/5/6 Focus stacks every second while not attacking instead of gaining Critical Strike Chance  
Ashe will critically strike on her next basic attack when she reaches 100 Focus stacks  
Initial Focus stacks are equal to Ashe's Critical Strike Chance  

---
**Corki**

Missile Barrage

&gt;Fixed a bug where Missile Barrage would sometimes fail to deal damage

---
**Hecarim**

*As a strong sustain fighter

*The Devastating Charge buff should let Hecarim jump over small walls and ledges to his opponents when he dashes to them. Keep in mind that when we say small ledges

Devastating Charge

&gt;If Hecarim's target is beyond narrow terrain

Onslaught of Shadows

&gt;No longer deals damage at the end location  
Rider damage increased to 150/250/350 (+1.0 Ability Power) from 100/200/300 (+0.4 Ability Power)

---
**Karma**

*Focused Resolve was impractical because whenever players wanted to use it, but now appropriately rewards Karma for using Mantra on her W and keeping her enemies close.*

Inner Flame

&gt;Mana Cost reduced to 50/55/60/65/70  
Explosion radius increased to 250 from 230

**Kha'Zix**

*The changes to Kha’Zix are ultimately about giving him more viable choices when picking evolutions. Evolving Void Spikes granted such huge damage, so its utility is there even at level one. Taste Their Fear’s evolution was previously reliant on having targets isolated. Now it works whether they are isolated or not, but does more damage against isolated targets, making it a more reliable choice. We also increased Void Assault’s damage reduction while in stealth to make it a slightly more enticing choice and to remind players of its additional utility.*

Taste Their Fear

Permafrost

&gt;Reduced slow duration to 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds from 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3

Aria of Perseverance  

&gt;Fixed a bug where Aria of Perseverance's Power Chord: Diminuendo was not decreasing damage dealt  
Lowered the duration of Aria of Perseverance's Power Chord: Diminuendo to 3 seconds from 4

***General Champion Notes***

---

Targeted wall-jump abilities now check both sides of the wall for the closest location of the cursor
We've added new targeting indicators to show how far the target is knocked back for the following abilities:  

&gt;Alistar's Headbutt  
Lee Sin's Dragon's Rage  
Poppy's Heroic Charge  
Vayne's Condemn  

We've improved consistency for abilities that behaved inconsistently when the targeted enemy uses Flash. We’re cleaning up these interactions so that either the ability won’t cast or Flash won’t be used up (it will be one or the other

&gt;Jayce's Thundering Blow  
Singed's Fling  
Skarner's Impale  
Volibear's Rolling Thunder  

---
---
***Changes to Slow Zones***  

---

All slow zones now update on a quarter-second interval, but the slow within the fields have not been changed.  

This change should make interacting with slow zones more intuitive while rewarding players who react quickly (as stepping out of a slow field will reward you faster). This is a small nerf to most of the champions affected

The following abilities have had their slow refresh rate reduced to 0.25 seconds:  
&gt;Singed's Mega Adhesive  
Lux's Lucent Singularity  
Gangplank's Cannon Barrage  
Lulu's Wild Growth  
Miss Fortune's Make It Rain  
Trundle's Pillar of Ice  
Varus' Hail of Arrows  
Viktor's Gravity Field  
Vladimir's Sanguine Pool  
Lux's Lucent Singularity also applies a 0.25 second slow to targets hit by the detonation  
Kog'Maw's Void Ooze missile also applies a 1 second slow to targets struck

1362341314.0,19lbns,Meta – The what’s and why’s (long read),Scarlex,68,13,31,"**About me and the goals of the text**

Hi

The goal of this text is simply to explain the concept of meta

This is in no way intended as a definitive guide to meta or how it works

Feel free to point out and/or yell at me for any mistakes I’ve made.

-----------------------------------------------------------

**What is this meta you speak of?**

If you look up the word in about any [dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meta), and essentially describes “X about X”. In a sense, this text is inherently meta as it revolves around the word meta, but doesn’t “delve into it”. Woah that's meta.

However, the LoL Meta is the “game surrounding the game”. By theory crafting, discussing, strategizing, even reading this, you are participating in the meta, the “game about LoL”. 

In short

Now, and the theories that support the statement.

---------------------------------------------------------

**Why have a meta? Why Care?**

So

Or as [PervySageMK](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19lbns/meta_the_whats_and_whys_long_read/c8pgu67) describes it:

&gt; META means Most Efficient Tactics Available. 

Pretty simple

An excellent example is the recent [AP](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_power) [Tryndamere](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Tryndamere) situation (as of early 2013): A build concept that has in theory been around for a long time is “discovered” by the community and incorporated into the *meta*. The strategies are of course backed up by theories that prove its efficiency. The reason you want a 2-player bottom lane is because it makes it easier to control/contest one of the global early-mid game objectives

However

**You should follow the *meta* because:**

* It is the current theoretical optimal way to play the game in order to win.

* When grouped with 2-4 strangers

* Not adhering to the *meta* could result in negative reactions and lower morale among your team (sadly)

**You should NOT follow the *meta* because:**

* The enemy team might not be able to counteract the different play style (nobody expects the X)

* The *meta* is often reflective of the competitive scene within LoL

* Someone must boldly go where no Summoner has gone before.

* You play a game for fun. Being forced into a specific strategy isn’t always fun.

-------------------------------------------------

**Then why do people rage when I play [AP](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ability_power) [Varus](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Varus)?**

League of Legends is a highly competitive game, shit becomes personal. It can be stupid and unfair, but that’s just how it works. However, you should not be deterred from trying new and interesting builds/champions!

It’s your leisure time and you should be able to decide what to do with it to a certain point. What I do recommend is that you take some time learning the build/champion in an environment where no one’s “special SWAGpoints” are affected (normal games). 

---------------------

**Interesting interpretations/views:**

[PabloEdvardo](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19lbns/meta_the_whats_and_whys_long_read/c8pfbiq)
&gt;Great post! As another interpretation, or colloquial language.

&gt;There's a giant dictionary of all the words that we use

&gt;If every individual drew their own conclusions on how to string those words together

&gt;So while we have core game mechanics (damage, turrets, xp, gold, items, win conditions - the dictionary), how we combine those mechanics (champion selection, positioning - the dialect / vernacular) is going to vary.

&gt;So by establishing community agreed-upon standards

----------------------------------

Thanks for reading!

1361235521.0,18scc1,An often forgotten step to improve your game: Itemization ,Fearlessbunny,67,10,26,"To give you some background

One of the most basic things that people at all levels often do wrong is what items they buy

I see people doing mistakes with their builds at diamond

It essentially comes down to

Should I buy defensive items?

Should I buy offensive items?

The best example to use is junglers

Xin Zhao has decent base damage

If you break him down you realize you need to have some tanky items since he's often the guy initiating fights rushing into several people and he has to be able to survive a bit of focus fire to be able to do his job.

However

Did you get of a few successful ganks and land a kill or two

But it's not uncommon to not have such a great game, you will be to squishy and will be utterly ineffective if the other team is doing their job. Which means madreds &gt; locket/warmogs is the way to go and you can follow up with a brutalizer/ghostblade after. This let's you initiate and absorb the punishment needed in a team fight, you will probably not be able to kill anyone 1 on 1, but you will force attention to yourself and that is the best thing for your team. If you just dash in and die after 1s you are completely useless.

Let's go for another example, and picked up another kill in a dragon fight so he was ahead of her. I was watching her and his R+Q+W combo took off 60-65% of her HP and she was unable to put out any real damage on him, he could simply bully her around because he was doing to much damage. 

The thing Syndra did wrong was that she didn't change her item build from what she always builds. She went 2x dorans &gt; deathcap rush &gt; voidstaff. While the build itself is fine

When it comes to AD Carrys itemization you have to seriously consider what you need and build after that.

Miss Fortune is probably the one with the most diversity of all AD's. If I have a team with a lot of AoE like a Lux+Amumu combo I often go with a Bloodthirster+Black Cleaver build. This build is uneffecient in straight out auto attack DPS but it makes your ultimate hit like a fucking truck meaning your one goal is landing a good ultimate and wipe everyone of the map before you even have to auto attack. However if I end up with a team with close to 0 AoE where my ultimate will be less important

Always think about what items you buy and in what order. Think about your team and the enemies team. What do you want and what do you need. Sometimes you want more damage

",12,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/tglvx/be_a_man_learning_to_trade_efficiently/,"Hey there everyone, Caleb ""Oskii"" Boese here with another write-up on League of Legends. I'm primarily a midlane player. This *will* be reflected in my writing: most of my examples will come from AP Carry vs AP Carry, but to be entirely honest they are perfectly applicable in any situation where you have two champions laying the smackdown on each other during the game [specifically laning but even junglers can find themselves in a lane from time to time].

Let me begin with a bit of a story about this all came about: I was playing with a group of friends I have, and I'm formulating ideas on how to play the matchup: he's melee, so autoattacks shouldn't really be terror. Stuns should be pretty easy to land because he'll have to come in range to last hit, and otherwise I'll play passively and avoid his cone and be fine, right? Sounds legitimate.

It wasn't.

The first time a creep got low, and again, and again. I'd burnt 3 of my pots to his 2: I was losing the lane and I was completely unable to farm up my Q. I still managed to win the lane with some help from some very strong ganks of my jungler, but damn did he hurt me while he pushed me under tower. I was so hurt that my farm was lacking and I was pretty sure my full combo would tickle the Purple Caster Minion.

After the game

**Low Elo players like myself have a hell of a lot of trouble just determining good trades and doing them.** What I felt like a hopeless lane against this Master of Metal

Some theory crafting to explain:
At level 1, his E does 25 damage to himself and 70 damage to you while generating around 20 shield. Even if he shields your next autoattack, you're STILL doing damage to him. Now he Es you again and does 70 damage, but you hit him with another two autoattacks and a Q. Sure, he's generating a bit of shield, but not nearly enough to even try and compete in the earlygame. You hit him with one combo before he gets shield up and he's forced to burn his first pot *already.*

So how do I apply this to any lane that's not Veigar vs Mordekaiser?

You make conscious decisions and quick calculations to **determine if you're going to come out ahead on the trade.** The first time you see your opposing laner, for you have **450 hit points of sustain** and he has a bonus 80 hitpoints to trade with. Sure, he's got increased mana regen and some ability power, but 15 AP earlygame isn't going to make up for that ridiculous difference of 370 hit points of sustain. **Check his runes,** as well. If he only has 30 MR, he's not running MR Blues, you can be sure of that. What are his blues? Maybe he's going as glass cannon as possible and running AP Per Level blues. With your masteries and runes giving you a decent bit of Magic Pen [10% + 8.5 usually], that might as well say ""true damage"" instead of ""magic damage."" Does he have really low armor? Like 10-15? He's probably running Mana Regen seals, FYI]. **Every time he comes back to lane, or look to play so aggressively as to kill him WHILE he's potting

- Does he have more sustain than I do? [Health Pot Advantage
- How does our mitigation stack up? [Does he suddenly have Mercury Treads and a Negatron cloak? Maybe trading might be ineffective.]
- Does he have kill potential before I do if we trade [ie. it doesn't matter if you're trading well with a Veigar if you're ending at half health and his full combo is up and you're at melee range waiting to be Event Horizon'd.]?
- Is the jungler nearby? Either one
- Does he have any really hard CC that might negate my ability to trade?

Also important are:
- Who has more creeps? [In the very early game
- If I trade heavily and run low on HP or oom

**Note#2** - If you'd like for me to continue this mini guide series w/ a different topic for the next guide

**Engaging Fundamentals**

When you want to engage someone for a 1v1 (usually meaning a fight to the death) you generally want to do so if one of these criteria are met:

 * Your enemy laner just used one of his/her major abilities and it is on CD.

 * If your enemy laner just used his/her only escape ability

 * If you have a CC advantage against your enemy laner

 * If you have an ""item advantage"" on your enemy laner

 * If you know your DMG potential and can ""burst"" him/her down in 1 or 2 combos
 
 * If you spot the enemy Jungler away from any position to help your enemy laner out.

 * If you ""catch"" your enemy in a very bad position in which he/she would have to ""burn"" an Summoner Spell to get away.

 * When you expect that your ""unique"" way of engagement will completely catch him/her off guard, and then quickly using your Molten Shield to charge up another stack for you stun, and then engaging from there.

I have been helping lower Elo people by duo-queuing with them on 2 of my other accounts. It has been very rewarding when you are able to help them. Contrary to popular belief, many of them are very nice and friendly! A lot of people stuck in elo hell are simply looking for a helping hand, some advice, a tutorial session. I am absolutely having a blast helping people out these days! However, I am only 1 person, and I am looking for more people to join me on this project! If you are interested, you can find me on RaidCall



**Why should I help these people in Elo hell?**
75% of the players are below bronze



**They are in Elo hell because they belong there!**
While this may be true, eventually they will fall back down. Your goal is not to carry them to 1250 and help them maintain. You are simply reaching out and helping them because you are genuinely a nice person!



**Sounds cool
This is for you if you:

Enjoy helping others in need

Are confident that you can help win a lower Elo game

Believe you have something to offer and teach to lower Elo players

Have Elo

Don't care about potentially losing your own Elo on the account

Don't judge people by their Elo rating

Want to achieve a sense of self-fulfillment by making someone else's day


**Steps to get started!**

1. Go join the chat room called ""ninjapanda"" (I had been doing it as a solo project)

2. Download and join our RaidCall group for voiced communication. Raidcall id: 4961622

He started the game and went 3/1 against a Ryze top as Lee sin, and if I didn't warn him about multiple things

When you're ahead, then roam to apply kill pressure. Now, your team can basically play as if they have TWO junglers, camping mid and bot respectively, or camping mid collectively. This is good if you have a really mobile champion with good killing potential (strong burst, reliable CC) or if the enemy wards poorly. The downside of this is that if your ganks are unsuccessful, you may lose time and have your lane catch back up. You also lose map pressure in your lane which may cause you to lose towers.

The second method, no matter what you should come out on top. You can either kill them, force them out of lane, or keep them so low that if they can't even effectively kill you under their own tower. If you focus on applying huge amounts of pressure on the tower, you do two things. First of all, you put damage onto the tower, and as anyone knows

The second most important one is that you force their jungler to camp you and not the rest of your team. This means that the rest of your team is free from jungle pressure and can play aggressive at all times while your jungler can gank. You also may even force their mid to hug top

Now for a few tips on how to do this effectively. First, you can expect the jungler to come top soon. You want to see this early and waste the junglers time. Time wasted by the jungler means no exp or gold from them. If you're really strong, you can push the lane and hunt the jungler that you caught with your ward, while the top laner struggles to follow. If you're ahead 4/1, and the jungler isn't, you should easily be able to 1v1 him no problem. Furthermore, if you ward more, who can feel safer and play better. 

Second, an enemy is worth even less than a tower, so why bother killing them? Instead, 150 gold for every member of your team is priceless. Buying tank items and sustain items allows you to sit under their turret and whack at it while they take potshots at you. If you're 3 levels ahead and a whole giants belt ahead, you can disrespect them all you want as long as minions are tanking the tower. You can heal it all off by lifestealing the next wave. You don't need to dive them and kill them under tower, you can just take the objective and make the game easier for the rest of your team. Furthermore, if you buy tanky items

Hi /r/SummonerSchool/, but I wanted to put my own experience, and if it helps even one person, it’ll be worth my time. I’m just a Silver I player, so I’m not a pro, but I wanted this to be a guide to help those in the lower elo range, where some pros have not experienced at all or recently. This will be quite the wall of text so I’ll try to include a TL;DR. Please let me know if there are anything to add!
  
A little about me: I started the season with 900 elo (Bronze V/IV equivalent). I went 1-9 (W/L) for my placements, with 2 months training with a Diamond 1 player. While there are a lot of repetitive things, I’ll be sure to follow up and answer questions in the comments! 
 
Table of Contents:  
I.	Warding and Map Awareness  
II.	Laning  
III.	Map Presence  
IV.	Positive Attitude  

Let’s begin:   
I.	Warding and Map Awareness 

Warding is extremely important, but the fact that they do not watch the minimap. Without constant map awareness, it’s basically useless the ward. The best suggestion I would give is to take a peek at the minimap between CSing.   

When to ward is important because you can waste a lot of time on a ward when you know it’s safe. For example, it’s not necessary to ward immediately (I would wait about a minute before feeling insecure). I’ll list when the first ward should go down for each lane (assuming you started with a ward), but this really depends on the enemy jungler’s clear time. This is assuming the jungler ganks after the first clear, but laners have to be cautious for a level 2 gank. This assumes the jungler starts at blue buff, if they are a red buff start jungler, use the other team color’s time (for example, if Shyvana takes red first, use the purple team’s ward time).  
Top: 3:30 (Blue) | 2:00 (Purple)  
Mid: 2:00 (Blue) | 2:00 (Purple)  
Bot: 2:00 (Blue) | 3:30 (Purple)  

Ward locations are less important
http://www.zyori.tv/newspost.php?n=2052  

II.	Laning  

There are many things about laning in Bronze that can give you a heavy advantage of the lane, watching CDs, knowing your damage, knowing the enemy’s damage, knowing the gold difference. 

Hopefully, even with the nerfs to the Pot limit. While each champion differs, I would recommend (for solo laners):  
-	Flask + 3 Pots (low risk jungler)  
-	Flask + 1 Pot + 1 Ward (high risk jungler)  
-	Cloth + 5 Pots (against AD)  
-	Rejuv + 5 Pots + 1 Ward (has an item to build out of Rejuv Bead)  
-	Mana Crystal + 2 Pots (Catalyst/Tear rush)  
-       Fairy Charm + 3 Pots + 1 Mana Pot + 1 Ward (high risk jungler)

These items don’t cover everything

Next is knowing the enemy’s CDs. Bronze players often spam their skills with no regards to mana costs and cool downs. For example, and is a great skill to remember the general CD length of enemy champions (including their ultimate).

If you want to tower dive, knowing that you can escape after the tower dive. An example would be, if you had 300 hp as a level 5 Fizz, against an Lux with 400 hp, it would be bad to attempt to dive the Lux because without the use of Fizz’s Playful/Trickster (E), he should be unable to kill the Lux (without summoner spells). Same thing applies with knowing the enemy’s damage, which usually results from taking one of their combos, when the best idea would be to recall. 

If you died twice to your laner, champions can snowball really hard with a 600 gold lead (also with the extra exp/denial). Levels make a big difference, since it provides free stats.  Being a level behind often results in a huge disadvantage, where you should not hard engage with the enemy.

III.	Map Presence  

Being in any lane, but it would be advised to shove the lane and roam.
Be sure to let the laners know that you are ganking. In Bronze

IV.	Positive Attitude 

I admit it, leading to disagreements and AFKs. There will be AFKs and leavers in Bronze, no doubt, but there is the same chance of that happening on the enemy team. It’s not your goal to get your team to be better, but yourself. If you are going 30/0/0 every game, you should be climbing. Many often claim they do very well in the past few games, but when I check their KDA, it’s best to mute your team if they are aggravating you and not to respond. I would advise turning off all-chat because there is simply no point in having it on besides getting ticked off.

For now, and be happy!

Have fun in SoloQ!  
My Lolking: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/35775577
Feel free to add me if you want to chat (NA)! Cheers!  

TL;DR: Be sure to ward a lot and watch the map. Be sure to know when to get objectives (towers, and know their damage. Most importantly, know your own damage. Be sure to roam and gank other lanes (be sure they know). Stay positive! Being a rager decreases your chance of winning. Have fun and play to improve (not to win)!

Alright
 

1. Deaths. If you die too much


2. Raging. If you rage at your team, if a guy told you that you suck ass and you should uninstall this game now, are you going to play at your full potential? No, you're not. If nobody rages, everyone would be happy. But i am not going to go into detail about this, because Athene already talked about this. Athene's video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7mPlpu4Zmo
3. Last hitting. Last hitting is one of the reasons that pro players are... You know
4. Getting caught. If you go around the map on your own little adventure, and that is to always look at the map. How many players are missing? If its over half their team, you should get out of there as soon as possble. But if its just their support, hes probably just warding. But beware, they may come unexpected.
5. Learn to play your role. For example: I am the top laner for my team, master that role. Do you like jungling? Master that role.
6. Know how to play other roles. Even tho being the best at whatever role is your favorite role is great
7. Do not play champions you are bad at playing. If you are bad at playing a specific champion
8. Learn/ Study each matchup! This is very important to learn. For example: You dont play Darius against Teemo, if you want to go pro.

13. Winning your lane. ""Win lane, helping your team out. That results in your team having the advantage and eventually winning.
14. Wards. ""Wards win games."" That quote is also VERY true. If you have vision and the enemy dont
15. Map awareness. This. If you NEVER look at your map
16. Copy the best, you should not lose more games than you win. That eventually raises your elo. But, how do you copy the best you may say. Well thats easy: Watch their live streams!
17. Learn your champion. If you favorite role is mid
18. Take advantage of you advantage. You got fed and you have a 5/0
19. Experience. If you have 200 more games played than your enemy
20. Objectives over kills. Taking down an objective like Dragon

* Extending 7: Sometimes you are bad at a specific type of champions

These tips form a holistic guide to pregame prep and getting yourself in the right headspace for jungling.

You want to be in a positive spiritual zone when you play League of Legends because this is a community known for its eternal optimism and compulsion to nurture. If you can't pay it forward and reward all of your fellow travellers with the same love, what is the point of going on? There is no point. And so,


Tip #1

Drink a ton of herbal tea. You'll know you're ready to play when your urine has become so completely clear that when you look into it in the toilet bowl you see crystal clear visions of the future. It might be an alternate future, no one seems cold, though-- just thrilled to be alive. You'll see this in your urine, and you will know that you have reached a state of relaxation conducive to the intense responsibility of piloting a cartoon through the video game woods.


Do not gaze at the vision for too long, dark place and I learned things that would break a lesser man. I say that not to boast, but simply as a warning. This horrible knowledge I carry with me is a heavy burden.


Tip #2

Once you have reached the clarity described in Tip #1


Tip #3

Build a small shack in the woods using only your bare hands and materials you can gather in the daylight hours of a single summer day. It is within this shack that you will embark on your jungle journey, you will be at one with the jungle. When the opposing jungler moves, you will feel it in the depths of your soul. This will be useful for counterjungling.


Tip #4

Talk to the wind.


I know, the wind will answer. The wind hates yuppies and never answers them, so if you truly are a yuppie, you must quit your job and spend some time aging so that you are no longer young or professional. You've already built a shack in the woods, so I'll assume that the urban part is not an issue.


The wind will always want to go off topic. It is really into model trains and will go on at length about the virtues of different styles of freight car


Tip #5

Breathe as little as possible. This will help keep your hands steady. You've heard of monks who live in the mountains and are able to derive all the nutrients necessary for their survival from breathing the fresh mountain air. With practice, I can survive for hours on the oxygen I absorb from a single, small piece of rich, dense peanut butter fudge. Remember, however, to only eat beets.

In cannon stance he has a skillshot, but he has no sustain and does badly in drawn out trades. Found in top lane. Average difficulty.

**Karma**: Medium-ranged magic damage support mage thing. Her ultimate is called Mantra and charges up over time to a maximum of two. She can expend Mantra to give her other three abilities an extra effect. Her Q, a shield, damages people around the target. Her E, a bind that damages people it hits and speeds up allies/slows down enemies, gains double speed. Whilst being crappy, her burst is pretty high, so beware. Her passive grants extra AP based on how low her HP is, although when she is she is usually mid or support. Average difficulty.

**Karthus**: Medium-ranged sustained damage caster with good global presence and farming ability. Deals magic damage. Q is a very small spammable AoE that does double damage if it only hits one person. W is a wall that slows and reduced MR. E is an AoE DoT. His ultimate is a channeled spell that, his passive roots him in place, makes him invulnerable, and he can continue to cast spells at no mana cost for a further seven seconds. Karthus is an excellent farmer between his Q and E. Bear his ult in mind if you drop low in another lane. Found in mid lane. Average difficulty.

**Kassadin**: Melee, and can be used after six stacks, each stack being gained when a spell is used nearby. His ultimate is a low-cooldown blink that damages. Its mana cost stacks if used repeatedly in a short time frame. His passive grants attack speed when he takes magic damage. Try to bully him before level six, as he gets a lot of his burst then. Be careful when he is MIA as his roaming potential post-6 is very good. Found in mid lane. Fairly high difficulty.

**Katarina**: Melee, reduces all of her cooldowns by 15 seconds. Her Q is a targetted nuke that bounces to four other people and marks them. This mark procs and damages whenever Katarina damages a marked target. W is a spammable AoE that grants MS if it hits a champion. E is a blink that can be used on allies or enemies. Her ultimate is a channeled spell that damages nearby champions over time. Despite her high burst, she is very susceptible to CC. Try to cancel her ultimate as soon as possible using a stun, silence, knockup or knockback. Found in mid lane. Fairly easy to use.

**Kayle**: Melee ranged physical magical damage support carry. Seriously. Her passive shreds % defensive stats per autoattack. Q is a single-target nuke that slows and amplifies damage on that target. Her W is a targettable heal that grants MS. Her E changed her from melee to ranged for ten seconds, not to save someone in the nick of time. Found everywhere, although mainly top. Fairly easy to use.

**Kennen**: Medium-ranged magic damage caster with an emphasis on AoE. Uses energy. His passive puts a mark on someone every time they're hit by one of your spells. Three marks and the target is stunned. Q is a skillshot that is blocked by minions. E grants movespeed and defensive stats at the cost of not being able to autoattack, hits all marked targets in the vicinity. His ultimate creates a field around him that strikes champions inside. Kennen will often try to initiate using his E. Therefore, time your hard CC for when  he uses it. Found in mid and top lane. Average difficulty.

**Kha'Zix**: Melee, which he can use on any of his skills. When evolved, Q gives extra autoattack range and gains %HP damage, W fires three skillshots that apply his passive, E gains extra range and resets on kills, and his ult gets an extra stealth. He will often max W first for the amazing poke it offers. Try to CC him and burst him as Kha'Zix is normally built glass cannon. Found in top, mid and jungle. Average difficulty.

**Kog'Maw**: Long-ranged artillery-themed AD carry. His passive gives him a short amount of time after death to run around, long distance AoE that reveals. Its mana cost stacks up if used in succession. Despite having entirely AP scalings, he is best used as an AD carry due to the range and damage on W. Try to trade with him when W is down. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**LeBlanc**: Medium-ranged, and can be re-activated to return to the original spot. E is a skillshot that slows the first target it hits, snaring them after a second if they remain in leash range. Her ultimate duplicated the last spell she used, and also gives bonus damage. Her usual combo is QR, followed by W or E. Her roaming potential is excellent. Banshee's Veil is a good counter item. Found in mid lane. Hard to use.

**Lee Sin**: Melee, and also grants a shield to both targets. The second cast grants him armour, lifesteal and spellvamp. E is an AoE that damages and reveals, with the second cast slowing all hit targets' MS and AS. His ultimate is a melee nuke that knocks the target back, also knocking up anyone that the original target hits. His early game damage is very high, but given his high-utility kit, come late game he also makes an excellent peeler. You can jump to wards using his W, also occasionally mid. Hard to use.

**Leona**: Melee support tank with excellent crowd control. Her passive marks targets whenever she casts a spell. This mark can be procced by other champions for bonus damage. Q is an autoattack modifier that deals bonus damage and stuns. W is a resist buff that after three seconds shoots out an AoE, also pulling Leona to the last champion it hits. Her ultimate is an AoE that slows and damages everyone it hits, whilst also stunning people in the centre. She functions very well with aggressive AD carries like Graves and Corki. During teamfights, try to use your Q and ultimate to stunlock important targets. Found in bottom lane. Average difficulty.

**Lulu**: Medium-long ranged support with high utility. Her passive, dealing magic damage. Her Q fires two skillshots, one from her and one from Pix, that slow and damage. W, on allied cast, speeds them up and gives them bonus AP. On enemy cast it turns them into a cupcake/squirrel/dragon, reducing their movement speed and stopping them from casting spells or autoattacking. E, shields them and transfers Pix to them

**Lux**: Long-ranged magic damage caster with good supportive capabilities as well as burst damage. Her passive grants spells a mark, which can be detonated to deal damage. Her ultimate is a long-ranged laser that procs her passive and deals heavy damage. Her Q is quite easy to avoid, but if you are caught by it Lux can follow up with (ahem) tons of damage. Her ultimate's cooldown gets very low with CDR, so keep in mind when playing and playing against her. Found in mid lane, although sometimes supports. Fairly high difficulty.",,False,t5_2t9x3,True

I just played a normal draft pick game with 3 summoner school members from chat and then a 5th random person. We had a 5-0 lead until we admittedly threw a couple teamfights and ended up back even.

Going on and on about our AD's build and how we didn't know how to teamfight etc. etc. He/She started surrender votes every chance they could even though the game was easily winnable.

1373548568.0,1i2t5b,Lee Sin main with some tips!,Wakanaga,64,10,60,"Hey /r/summonerschool. Been an active League player for close to 3 years now and Lee Sin was one of my first champion purchases and since then I have easily played over 500 games with him. This will be a mixed bag of tips (skill level wise) and I just really enjoy what this sub stands for as I see League being an ever growing pool of knowledge to dive into and having the drive to learn and learn is great! So I want to help.


1) When playing mid or top Lee Sin securing a kill at level 3 is the easiest thing in the world. You want to have a skill point in all your abilities and flash. Hopefully you have won a trade or two up to this point so they should be around 75% health to make it even easier. And if you hit level 3 and can do this while they're level 2 that's just icing on the cake! Just W up to a minion they are last hitting if they are melee or a minion nearest to them if they are ranged (I habitually double tap W literally every single time I use it and through proper auto attack management don't run into energy issues). Start with an auto attack or two and then hit them with E (knowing how many autos to squeeze in comes with practice and if they have escapes, etc.), hopefully you can get one more auto in and then E again for the slow/auto attack slow if they decide to stay and duel the first blood out. During all this time you want to be moving in between autos to a position where you can Q them with no minions in the way. First thing they get around 50% health you use the first part of your Q, ignite, then auto. At this point most people realize they are dead and will try to flash away. Simply use the second part of your Q, auto attack them once and enjoy your kill! This works so well because at 50% no one is too panicy about dying and still willing to trade some blows. They realize you plan on killing them once your Q is on them and by that point it is too late! Really hard for an enemy to outplay this with proper runes/masteries and execution.



2) Never get stuck in which ability you should max first! When laning with Lee I find myself maxing all 3 in different situations. If you're up against a middle that is running health or ap Seals then you for sure want to max Q. Getting a mid laner to half health through a few autos and an E with some minion help is super easy. At level 6 against a squishy at half health you just have to land one Q on them and they are dead. Q to them. Auto. E. Auto. Ignite. Ult and they will fly away run a few steps then die from ignite. When I top Lee against any bruiser/tank I usually find myself maxing W. Super short cooldown on a shield that becomes substantial quick and the lifesteal is invaluable for winning trades and sustaining in lane. You can W to a minion they are about to last hit to deny it (Makes me miss DOTA) multiple times a wave and can be super annoying. I do rarely find myself maxing E but against someone like Tryndamere it can be great. The auto attack debuff really matters for trades and if you build Hydra Lee your wave clear is super good with a maxed E.



3) When jungling Lee your IDEAL gank would be a gank laid out the same way I try to get my First Blood. You always always want to try to W to them if you can. It is the best way to get max damage out (execute mechanic on second use of Q) and you don't have to land a skillshot from max range



4) The way I ward hop with Lee is kind of different from most people I have seen and talked to and I don't know if it will work for you but it definitely works for me. I always put wards in the same slot (please make it a habit) and keybind that slot smartcast to Shift W and I have smartcast W bound to just hitting W. I can just double tap W


5) My build paths for Lee are always different when I lane. But when I jungle I pretty much have one build path, Bulwark, Randuins, Last Whisper, last item up as needed thought it's usually Ruby Sightstone (I sometimes buy this way earlier if I'm getting real fed. I find myself only needing 1 or at the most 2 wards per back for most the game so I don't like to blow all the money on a Sightstone early but late game you can ward hop like crazy and you can never have enough vision when anyone getting caught once spells gg. I like to carry early and steal kills, make plays which all you need damage wise is Elder Lizard to make that happen. The true damage really hurts and you have insane AD scaling that makes that little bit go a long way. I then try to transition into a disruption tank/adc peeler for mid late game. That requires some tankyness.


5) Team fights with Lee can be hard to determine on what you should be doing. If you're going carry Lee Sin then you will find yourself generally pretty useless once late game has started. Your holysh*t damage requires perfect execution in a cluttered team fight which honestly isn't going to happen that much and you are super easy to shut down with a single Silence/Stun/Snare. I don't have to much to say on team fighting as carry Lee Sin except go for their squishiest front line or if you see an opening dive the back line. For tanky Lee Sin my go to team fight strategy revolves around W'ing up to my front line and getting a double E and Randuins use on their back line. Then I decide if its worth staying to secure a kill or two


6) Flashing over a wall to bait a flash then ward hopping back over it as a get away is some of the most fun I have had in this game.


7) Jungle minions are there as a get away


8) Lee Sin has any number of gank paths. Running through lane, QQ in the blink of an eye is crazy and with proper execution is free kills. Lee Sin also has amazing counter ganking. Lets say middle is getting ganked and the enemy mid and jungle have used most of their abilities trying to kill your mid and he is running away at 30%. Once you W to him and given him the shield and your full damage combo with your mids full damage combo will turn any gank around for a quick kill. Then you can usually follow up and get the double. Ganking as Lee Sin is nothing less but an art form. The amount of repositioning of yourself you can do and disruption on an enemy's movement whether through ult or slows you can do makes almost any situation a possible kill. You get in their face without having to use Q and they flash away? Thanks for the flash and the kill. Options options options. Can't stress it enough.


9) I can't think of much else right now

EDIT: Random something I just thought of. Lee Sin is a champion of flow. Listening to music with a steady beat pattern and some kind of groove can help with the mentality of executing Lee Sin as the God of a champion he is. 

EDIT2: Post is going up some and getting good reception! Just got done playing 3 games this AM (all with Lee coincidentally) and have a few things I forgot. The spell vamp on his W is amazing. When finishing off the buff monsters You can just WW QSmiteQ and get a huge chunk of health back. Makes sustaining the jungle great. You can start camps with WW then do a full ability rotation with autos inbetween and the lifesteal/spellvamp buff will be up the whole time. It is imperative to utilize this part of his kit properly to stay healthy for the first 15 minutes of jungling so you can gankgankgankgank which is why you pick Lee Sin in the first place.

If you're running up to someone about to 1v1

You will kick people away and they will live with less than an auto's worth of health. It happens to the best of us. A way to try to prevent this is if you're going for an execute you can QQ to them E then auto then ult and auto them again as they fly away if you cancel the end of your ult animation and right click them fast enough

If you're in a situation where people are lined up you always want to ult the person closest to you so as they fly they knock up everyone you can. Don't want to misclick and ult the second or third person back and still ahve someone sitting in your face. Obvious one but easy to just want to ult the lowest person (everyone the person flying hits takes the same damage as the first person you kick).",self,t5_2t9x3,1373562143.0,leesin,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1i2t5b/lee_sin_main_with_some_tips/

**Make It To Lategame**.

Lategame is a special, everybody has at least a couple of big items, and everybody has the potential to wreck any non-tanky champion who takes one step in the wrong direction.  Towers and inhibitors melt in seconds, and a hard sneeze is all it takes to clear a minion wave.  Every death matters.  With this much pushing potential, a 60-second death timer is an enormous momentum swing.  Even a 5v4 creates a big split push opportunity that can't be stopped.  A team can be 10-50 in kills, but landing one good AOE suddenly turns into a won teamfight and GG.

In short, or a hole in your map vision is all it takes to lose a game in the 40-minute range.  You've probably seen dozens of tournament-caliber matches that are thrown by a single mistake in lategame - those are 2k+ professional players making those mistakes.  People at your Elo are DYING to make those mistakes!  Do you really think a 1k Elo player is going to stay with their team?  Do you really think they'll have ward coverage?  No, they'll be stupid and cocky and try to pick 1v1 fights because they're fed.  And that's when you jump on them with your whole team and go push to win.

Get insane ward coverage.  Every inch of your jungle should be lit up like a spotlight.  They have Oracle's?  Who cares?!  They'll go sweep wards in a small group and say ""HEY COME KILL THE TWO OF US WITH YOUR WHOLE TEAM WE'RE RIGHT HERE"" or they'll commit their whole team to sweeping your jungle and you'll send somebody to go split push and get out when they start chasing you.

The team that wins lategame is the team that doesn't make stupid mistakes

        *Reacting to: Junglers, Your Mistakes, Tower Dives, Ganks, and Force Fights
        *Zone Control and Lane Pressure
        *Closing Out a Winning Game
        *Stalling for Victory in a Losing Game

##3.  The Post-Game After Action Report: This is when you talk to your apprentice about their decisions during the game.
	*Have a detailed list of talking points.  Include times
	*All talking points must be relevant to the apprentice's actions
	*Have the apprentice give at least three sustains and improves for their game-play.
	*Offer the apprentice at least three sustains and improves for their game-play.
	*Take a 10-20 minute break!
	*Rinse and Repeat from step 2.

For those of you interested in a detailed explanation of any of my talking points, or if you want to tell me how noob I am for only being Silver III and offering up a coaching guide; still feel free to PM or message me.  I want to hear from all of you that are willing to give me your time.  But before you judge, just remember, Jimmy Johnson wasn't throwing passes to Michael Irving when the Cowboys won both Super Bowls against the Buffalo Bills.

That's all.

The main issues I see at lower elo are the amount of deaths people stack up. I don't care how and why they have so many deaths

A death is a mistake. Games usually turn into major killfests or simply last too long because people get greedy for kills. It can turn  an easy

Secondly, but you will see, ESPECIALLY in tournaments how important a death is.  Remember games where it is late game and your AD or AP carry get caught out randomly and you lose the game? That's what it is precisely, people  higher elo know how to take towers, dragons, or even Baron off YOUR death. You will see that people don't die very often in high elo games because it is not about the kills at that point, it is about objectives. It ain't CoD or some shit.

With that being said, how I could have prevented it, and what kinds of mistakes I made.  League of Legends is a game that punishes mistakes. The team who makes the least mistakes win.

Think about the last deaths in your recent game. How you could have prevented them. The consequences it lead to.
And trust me

Edit: I don't mean NEVER die, you learn that 3 minutes is a vital time for every jungler (2nd camp clearing, looking for gank), and then next time, you play safer to prevent that death and mistake.

As an AD carry main, it's because I wasn't experienced enough. In teamfights, I wasn't wary enough of my positioning. Of course, deaths that result in 1-3 trades are always great, but most of the time, a death means netting the enemy team 300 to 500 g closer to their next item.

**Mechanical:** Mechanical skills are things like last hitting, animation-canceling, reaction times, anything like that.


**Theory:** Theory skills are knowing the cooldowns on enemy and ally abilities, knowing what items to buy in each situation, knowing the best ward spots, and when to use them, knowing when you need to go back, ect. Theoretically, theory skills could be replaced by someone next to you or on Skype telling you what to do.

**Social:** Social skills are the most under-estimated in League, to try and ensure teamwork and good attitude. ""Avoiding trolls"" as it were. Social skills include: taking the blame, even when it isn't your fault. Being flexible in champion picks so your team can play to their strengths. Ending arguments. Not reacting badly and trolling. Not taunting, insulting, or blaming your team and offering advice without being condescending.

While some players with exceptional skill in the first two categories can get to a high Elo (hence 'high Elo trolls')

**Get the right runes**

A typical ad carry rune page looks like this:

* Attack Damage Marks 9x
* Armor Seals 9x
* Magic Resistance Glyphs 9x
* Life Steal Quintessences 3x

**AD carry masteries:**

* 21/XX/XX

Taking the left side of the offense tree and putting the remaining 9 points in utility or defensive

**CSing/last hitting:**

* People in Silver can't CS well

* If you get pushed to your tower

* You can practice CSing in a custom game. Just take normal runes and masteries

* Taking 2 points into Butcher (+4 damage to minions and monsters) instead of 2 points into attack speed can also greatly help you with CSing.

**Orb walking

This video explains it pretty well. I'd like to add to that

A good way to practice this

**Some tips for playing Caitlyn in specific:**

In the game I specced he played Caitlyn

Her Q (Piltover Peacemaker) can be used to shove waves quickly. If you have good warding you should be using this to shove your opponent against the tower

* Her W (Yordle Snap Trap) reveals fog of war for a brief moment

* Regarding placing traps, or next to the opponents tower if you're pushing them to it. This works especially well against short range AD carries.

* Her E (.90 Caliber Net) Is generally used as an escape

* When lining up E&gt;Q quickly you can do the popular combo. The net leaves the opponent slowed making is hard to dodge the coming Q

* Her R (Ace in the Hole) Can be used to harrass and finish.There's not really much special to this skill.
When lined up with E &gt; Q combo it is possible to do huge burst damage.Because of the .50 cal net slow it's also hardy for opponents to block the shot.

* Caitlyn is one of the only AD carries with good AD ratio's on her skills. There for Bloodthirster or Infinity Edge are way better as a first item than Blade of the Ruined King for her.

* Auto attacking opponents when they go in for CS is extremely important

1371776281.0,1grkd2,Five traits that every League player has and how to broaden your learing horizon,Chenille7,68,19,14,"Hello. I am a gold 5 division player in League of Legends but that does not mean that I am good at the game in any way, I then noticed that those players also had the same variety of skills that the high elo players did

There are many great guides written on how to become a better player, and champions. The problem that many players who want to get better have is that there is no organized chart for them to follow. You can improve and focus on just one aspect of your gameplay but if you end up in a situation where you can’t apply that skill, then you’ll have nothing going for you and all that work you put into yourself will be for naught. Frustrating, huh?

That being said, something that “speaks” to you. Everyone who plays League has at least one skill that makes them stand out from their peers.

1)	Mechanics: You rarely misclick and can attack move with the best of them. Your knowledge of positioning makes you hard to catch and pin down. Ability combos come to you like breathing.
Pro Examples: Doublelift

2)	Knowledge: If you don’t know something about the meta
Pro Examples: Scarra

3)	Awareness: You have a sixth sense of where people are
Pro Examples: Dyrus

4)	Charisma: You can make the most toxic player tolerable for a time. People listen to you when you make calls. You can be the glue that holds the team together. 
Pro Examples: Reginald

5)	Drive: You are your own harshest critic. Failure is not a word in your vocabulary. You can steady yourself if you’re on tilt.
Pro Examples: Anyone who has ever put serious effort into improving their game. That means you.

The secret to becoming a better player is knowing what you are already good at and then using your strengths as a starting point in branching out to all the other aspects one must master to become good at League of Legends.  For example, maybe that means that it’s time to look inward (drive).

Now the chart itself does have a glaring weakness of not taking into effect various levels of each of these aspects. For example

So too fastforward a bit to my point I ended up getting completely shut down in lane. I maxed turtle for defense but Panth's spears were still just too devestating. I think here is where a lot of lower elo players and newer players start to get antsy. They think that their sole purpose in lane is to dominate and win their lane. I was able to switch mindsets. I knew I was not going to be able to beath pantheon and on top of that I wasn't going to get much farm. So on my first back I get a GP5 and start to build tanky for late game. Jungler ganks me once I get a kill but he sees my lane is stable so he is able to camp other lanes. Fast forward to late game I still havent died and Panth has 40+ CS on me but only 2 kills from the few roaming adventures he had been on an my GP5 kept me close in farm. But because our jungler was able to camp mid and get mid and himself fed we were ahead on gold and kills going into late game. Tank Udyr is very strong late game and synergized well with our team and we ended up being able to poke them down to nothing and win within 30 minutes. In a lane I was completely out manuevered and out classed in I was able to not die and hardly lose out on any CS and ended up 2/0/6. So my point is you can win by not feeding. Know when you're going to get beat up in lane deviate from your build

TL;DR - Didn't get to pick my lane ended up countered and outplayed. Didn't feed any kills. Patience and smart play led to no deaths and a fed mid and fairly powerful late game presence.

1360015263.0,17w3w2,General tips of solo queue.,Litejason,53,4,16,"Small bit of background. [Info about me](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/24536169#profile). [Here's proof of my summoner!](http://imgur.com/32AcLON)

With that said

1. Remember that this is only a game, then find a way to relax first, then play League.

2. Solo queue is a ladder designed for competitive people in a fairly competitive setting. If you are a casual gamer and do not like the occasional flamer then ranked will not be for you. But do give ranked a go if you feel you will have a fun experience in the ladders.

3. Do not worry about your ranking. I used to do this pre-S3 ranking system where 'ladder anxiety' kicked in

4. Take each game as an individual game (even the promotion games). If you put yourself in that pressure of 'I gotta win every game to be good'

5. Make yourself comfortable before you click 'match me with team mates'. This includes a bit of self comforting; breathing calmly

6. Be open in what roles you play. I usually get the champion select chat going saying ""prefer ad/top/mid"". This will encourage others to call upon their preferred lanes and it will help to provide some knowledge of your allies before the game starts. If your preferred role gets taken

7. Use the loading screen to your advantage. Many people just stare at the loading screen borders and scoff at each others borders. You should be using the time effectively instead

8. When the game starts

9. Help your jungler at all times. It's not the junglers job to baby sit your lane, you may even turn it around and get a kill or two from your efforts.

9. Focus on CSing. Generally you want to be aiming for 80-90cs at 10minutes across all lanes. This is not always possible but you want to be aiming for that. A solid 80-90cs compared to 50-60cs is a 500golds difference

10. Work with your jungler. This usually involves you keeping your eye out for your jungler

11. Make use of the pings. This is extremely important in solo queue because of no voice communication. Pings are what give your team information about the map and what you're doing. Ping when you want help, ping back if you think the situation is dangerous. There is always a situation to use the pings simply because of the control you get over your team using pings. Don't spam it though, obviously.

12. Learn to damage trade. This is supposed to be a short general guide, but dealing 1 spell at a time to the enemy and 'testing the waters'. If they take the damage and do not retaliate then try to play more aggressive, forcing more lane dominance onto the opponent. If you're going even in trades, then focus on CSing as well as countering their damage. If you're losing trades then you'll need to base for more health pots, going sustain items or calling your jungler for help. You want to always make sure you can stay in lane whilst taking some punishment, don't be reckless and burn all of your sustain in a couple of trades, be sustaining and this will help you stay in the lane for longer.

13. Team fight accordingly to these rules:
 * Am I in a good position to deal damage and be safe? If yes
 * How likely are either teams able to dish out their damage? If you're against an AoE heavy composition then you should be more careful of your positioning and engage. Generally if you can survive the burst of an AoE comp then you will win the rest of the fight. Avoid the AoE damage and kite/peel for your allies.
 * Am I chasing or the one being chased? If you're the one being chased then you should not run back to your turret, such as a flash dazzle on Taric; Amumu flash ult into the enemy team. Going 1v5 is no good so always be aware of the position of your team mates (The best way to get people on the same page is to ping to signal to fight).
 * Whose left in the fight. This is very important

14. Gold! Use it! There is no use in 2k sitting in your pockets being stowed away for nothing. Gold is the single most advantageous stat in the game, cannot take damage, so make the best use of the gold earned by your hard work CSing and getting kills. Even buying 1 pot for the lane may make a huge difference. A good example of this is WingsofDeathx. He always buys around 4-6 pots when he goes back to the nexus because of the instant sustain it provides. Dyrus also tends to spam pots a lot too.

15. Push turrets for map positioning. The Korean's love the turret pushing aggression

16. **Buy wards.** This should be much earlier through the post but it really is a simple job. As a support warding is easy

17. Don't mess around doing nothing, focus the enemy nexus like Yellowpete does and remain calm when you're in the enemies nexus. With homeguard boots currently this is very important. You never know when the enemy could just jump from nowhere and kill you. Therefore, you just want to end the game as soon as you can.

Those are just some general tips. I know I have missed out many things out however many other things in League cannot be explained in words,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1360015674.0,,,t3_17w3w2

1349881127.0,1195l6,Protect the bot [Game mode idea],wioym,59,12,31,"New game mode: Protect the bot.

Map: Summoner's Rift

---------------

Rule#1: get the same champion bot (except annie or brand or whatever bot that is not retarded) on each side and each team tries to protect the bot. 

---------------

The side that has the most bot deaths loses. Nexuses destruction doesn't matter decide the winner of the game

---------------

Rule#2: Upon the spawn you would have to follow the bot and stick with it till the first bot death has been spilled. The point of putting 2 same champion bots is that they will both chose the same starting lane. 

---------------

Under the condition that 2 bots will have the same amount of deaths then we take a look at the assists and kills. kill has 2 points and assists has 1. 

---------------

Rule#3: Surrender is not allowed. If a team surrenders it would be considered as a straight away lose even though their bot may have had less deaths.

---------------

FAQ:

* 1. Why are we not allowed to start the game as if it was a normal summoner's rift's game?

The answer to that is because for new people who don't realize is that the point isn't to have a better advantage over an enemy team and objectives have no influence on the game mode (even though that would give you an ability to kill enemy bot easier and break through front line).

* 2. Why not combine deaths

In that condition some more experienced players may have an upper hand by killing an enemy summoner's champion and giving nonstop assist to a bot.

* 3. Why summoner's rift?

Summoner's rift is a huge map. This way you will have to think if you should protect the fellow bot or go to another lane to kill an enemy bot? Becomes a bit more interesting than just a chaotic fight (ARAM)/running from one side of map to another in matter of seconds (twisted). 

* 4. Why should I play this?

A lot of fun especially if you are with your friends and you just yell at the bot thinking that it would hear you.

**EDIT:** * 5. What can I learn from this?

**There are a lot of things you can learn from this:**

* a. Team coordination and communication.

* b. When is it good to roam around the map and push other lanes.

* c. Which champions are item based and which are level based.

* d. What champions work together in team fights. 

* e. You will have to think that you have to end the game at a certain moment. Timing is a key to that. 

U learn all that playing in the game and you can put theory into practice.

We get a lot of people posting streams either looking to help others or looking for help. Unfortunately, thus people rarely check stream posts because there's a high chance the stream won't be helpful at all.

From today forward

* The mods will launch a site similar to [this one](http://liveleaguestream.com/) of approved /r/summonerschool streamers and high quality streams we feel are helpful to the community. Each stream will have a stream description so you know what you're getting into.

* The mods will scan streams themselves to check for quality. This process will take a while

* There will be a section on the site for streamers who are looking for help. Anyone can submit their stream to this section and it will also display whether or not it is live.

For now

In addition, I recommend y'all check out the Personal Training section of our sidebar.

- There is always a short lvl 1 fight in the middle to contest control of both relics. For that reason

- starting gold is equal to boots 1 + 475. Always buy boots + dorans because of the level one fight

- The winning team typically has an ADC because the gold income level is higher, fighting space tends to be cramped, so an ADC's reach gives them extra ability to contribute damage.

- Since there are fewer members of the team to peel/protect, also because they have such good early-game burst potential.

- The secondary member of the team fills the role of bruiser/peeler

- The tertiary member can be anything, or assassin.

- From the habits of old TT, not running a jungler means no mid-map awareness/control, leaving your team vulnerable to altar theft and cross-lane ganks.

1336499230.0,td8js,Notes on this week's free champions,Kittsy,51,2,27,"Noticed this hadn't been done yet - I'm no expert with all of these

* **Leona**

Leona is traditionally a support/tank. In the meta, then builds tanky items like an Aegis of the Legion, Mercury Treads, Shurellia's Revierie, Frozen Heart, or Bashee's Veil. If you feel you're tanky enough at a point with Leona and want more damage, Trinity Force is a possibility
*Alternative builds*: Some people might try AP or (tanky)DPS Leona, Leona's ganks are potent enough that jungling is definitely possible. Solo lane Leona isn't advised because she is a poor farmer and can't use her passive in fights without someone else around.

* **Malphite**

Malphite is usually played as a tank in either top lane or in the jungle. Malphite's main strength is his ultimate which is a long-distance, Malphite often gets a Philosopher's Stone &amp;/or Heart of Gold, before building tanky items such as a Warmogs Armor, Force of Nature, or Randuin's Omen. A common mistake by new Malphite players is to build too much armor. Malphite's W gives him bonus % armor and his E does a tiny bit more damage based off of your armor, but neither of these are major enough to neglect health and magic resist - both super important for tanking.  
*Alternative builds*:  Malphite is very playable as a mage in midlane. His passive allows him to trade with most characters if you avoid them long enough to let it recharge, and more control over when you push your lane. Standard items include 2 Doran's Rings, Sorcerer's Shoes, Abyssal Sceptre, Glacial Shroud, and Deathfire Grasp. Deathfire Grasp becomes a major part of his damage output and you must remember to activate it. 

* **Vladimir**

Vladimir is usually played as a mage in top or midlane. He is strong in lane because of his combination of being manaless and having a self heal, but it hurts you to activate and doesn't do great damage. It's almost always better to use as an escape mechanism. Usual items include Hextech Revolver(eventually Will of the Ancients), Crystal Scepter, and Deathcap. A lot of players have recently been using Deathfire Grasp too.  
*Alternative builds*: I suppose tank or jungle Vladimir might be vaguely possible

* **Annie**

Annie is usually played as a mage in midlane. Annie has strong base damages, and charging up her stun by doing so. If you've harassed your enemy down, Annie has a lot of potential to kill someone with her combo at level 6. Against a single target, use your Q to stun before casting other spells. It has the shortest cooldown, so you have a chance to cast it again, and it cannot miss so you don't risk wasting a stun charge or an entire ult. In teamfights, try and stun multiple people with your W or ult. Annie can be built pretty much anywhere on the scale from a glass cannon mage to a tank, but a middleground is usually best. Good items for Annie can include a Rod of Ages(if you don't expect to be given blue buff), and a Zhonya's Hourglass. Lots of other items such as Frozen Heart, are also an option on Annie.  
*Alternate builds*: After her most recent buff, and tier 3 ability power quints. Test it out with a friend in a custom game first, but I imagine this could be very fun and pretty viable if done right.

* **Olaf**

Olaf is playable as either a toplaner or a jungler. Olaf can be a major bully in toplane due to his spammable true damage and good sustain with his W, Olaf will usually want to max his true damage and apply it to an opponent whenever possible after level 3/5(depending on the enemy champion). Very effective against melee champions. In the jungle, Olaf can have quite decent ganks with the burst from his Q and E, and has an ok cleartime. Probably best in top lane. He is usually built as a tanky damage dealer with items like Warmogs Armor, Frozen Mallet, Atma's Impaler, Maw of Malmortus, Frozen Heart
*Alternative builds*: I have heard of people trying spellvamp Olaf to heal off of his E, but loses a lot of his ability to dive into the middle of the enemy team.

* **Warwick**

A lot of new players are encouraged to play Warwick as a jungler because he keeps himself alive very well, especially since in early levels you might be leaving someone 1v2 toplane where you can't do much to help them early on. He is, however, very effective in a solo lane. His weakness in lane is that he can't kill minions quickly if the enemy wants to push the lane, but he sustains himself very well with his passive and Q, and his ult is a very powerful skill that scales well into lategame. He usually builds tanky items, such as a Spirit Visage, Mercury Treads, a Doran's Ring or two is not uncommon
*Alternative builds*: Some players build Warwick more damage-centric, Madred's Bloodrazor, or Beserker's Greaves. This can make Warwick very strong in a 1v1 situation, but he is already naturally powerful in these situations and this sort of build can destroy his ability to initiate against the enemy team, and makes him very weak to burst. AP and on-hit builds suffer the same fate.

* **Caitlyn**

Caitlyn is almost exclusively played on botlane as a ranged AD carry. Caitlyn has some strong early game damage with her skills, her main focus in the early game should be last hitting minions to prepare for lategame. Lategame, Caitlyn should use her range and net(dash/slow) to position herself safely while outputting as much damage as possible. Remember that her ult has a significant charge-up time, so don't use it on anyone you could just attack. Her standard build is something like Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, Bloodthirster, Phantom Dancer
*Alternative builds*: Because of her good range and powerful poke skill early game

* **Kayle**

YAY KAYLE~! Kayle is currently my most played character, making this usually a sub-optimal build. I find she's usually best played as a straight AD carry, but an on-hit build or tanky-AD build can work as well, and a more aura-focused build is probably best if you find yourself playing support(probably her worst role, but not terrible.) Kayle has a very powerful early game indeed, max Q first unless you're being heavily out-harassed and just need to survive (max W), or are against someone like Sion who just pushes the lane and walks off somewhere else (max E for farming). Take E at level 1, your basic attacks with E active will hit harder than most characters at level 1. By level 2, be careful of the mana cost, Kayle's ganks are pretty good because she has a slow
*Alternative builds*: On-hit Kayle (Wits End, Madred's Bloodrazor) can work, but generally does less damage than building straight AD in the lategame. If you need magic damage, though, it should work fine. A support with Zeke's, Aegis, Shurellia's, Deathcap

* **Talon**

Talon is a physical damage assassin usually played in midlane. His strength is that, Talon will usually max Rake first and harass his opponent a bit while CSing. After level 6, you should judge when you can kill an opponent and try to get the kill when you judge they're low enough HP. If the enemy is out of lane or you've pushed them to their turret and they can't push the wave quickly (like Ryze or Fiddlesticks), then you can take the chance to go and gank another lane, which he is very good at.  
*Alternative builds*: Talon can possibly go to the jungle or toplane

* **Twisted Fate**

Twisted Fate is mostly played as a mage in midlane. He gives a hard to notice, he can have very powerful ganks by 'locking in' a gold card BEFORE you use your ultimate, then teleporting to a lane, stunning an opponent and following up with your Wild Cards. If you coordinate this with your jungler, it is very likely to net kills almost every time and allows you to win multiple lanes for your team. Usual items include Deathcap, Lichbane, Void Staff
*Alternative builds*: TF is quite often build as an AD carry, but his weaknesses make this a dangerous choice in most situations. Other players build TF with on-hit items like Wits End and Ionic Spark, this plays very similarly to AD TF, but doing magical damage and usually being a bit more durable, but generally has the same weaknesses and is not recommended. I have heard of more success than failure with jungle TF and tank TF, but if you lose while playing that, your team will probably blame you. Experiment with them at your own risk.

Go to http://mumble.sourceforge.net/, please refer to http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Installing_Mumble

 After finishing installation, then add the following info:

Port: **10054**

Label is how it will show up in your servers list, if you were me, it would look something like it does in the screenshot provided in the album.

Click OK

If you get this (example provided in the album as well)

If you cannot connect after installation, the client will not connect to the server after the initial install, but after restarting it, everything will work fine.

There are two things that I recommend doing once you’ve connected.  The first is clicking on **Configure** -&gt; **Settings** -&gt; **Overlay**, close out of the current window and go back to the main Mumble screen.  Click on **Configure** again, then run the **Audio Wizard**.


***Audio Wizard***

Select the appropriate devices that you want to use for your incoming and outgoing sound.  Normally, you can pick it from the drop-down menus.  Click **Next**.

Make use of the slider bar to find the lowest latency at which you hear no interruptions in sound

This is the first chance you’ll get to make sure that your microphone is set up correctly in Mumble.  Read over the instructions

If you want to set it up so that no one hears you talk unless you’re holding down a specific button, follow the directions listed underneath the slider to make sure that Mumble doesn’t pick up every little noise made in the background where you are.

Under quality, move it to low quality, but balanced should be fine.  You’re welcome to set it to high, as well.  This is a personal choice more than anything.  I don’t recommend leaving text to speech on, due to silly behavior in channels at times.

1368516961.0,1eawna,Some simple tips for everyone!,Zyphemis,56,9,22,"No, after playing League for nearly two years and after too many games

First off, on a very, very slow basis, but I'm going to be blunt. *You're wasting your time.* No, honestly. I wasted 200+ games in Gold 1 that was precious time that I wish I could have taken back. I would redo those games if I could.

Queue into ranked with the mindset to improve. I've seen people with thousands and thousands of games played, both mechanics and decision making alike. That's a waste of time in my eyes. It's okay if you're playing for fun, that's a different story, but I'm sure we're all here to improve. *Don't waste time.* Actively seek ways to become a better player.

Secondly, it is. I won't have it any other way.
""Guys

""My teammates are so bad

Sounds like you.

Hell, there are times when one can't do anything, but then how can you explain all the Diamonds and Challengers that carry their way so easily out of several Leagues at once? I started ranked and Saintvicious' Smurf was in my League. (Xin Zhao's Elite, Gold V, at the time.) Two weeks later, he was Diamond 1 in less than a hundred games. Those straight wins.

You know how they do it? They destroy the Nexus. Yep

League of Legends isn't about your feeder teammates, or even your champion and your KDA. They're just mere pawns. It's about how you cause that Nexus to explode, that final piece, *the king*. And it's about how you get there. And you won't do that by walking around looking for kills, wasting time standing around in the jungle, or even by farming, *yes*

Actively be doing things to improve the game towards winning at all times. Honestly. Playing jungle is the best way to practice this

Winning your bot lane, ward, CALL ****ING DRAGON CAUSE NO ONE IS GOING TO EXCEPT YOU. Trust me, I've won games where every single lane went negative. I'm not joking. I came into teamfights with bruisers and mids that have more than ten kills, yet the game was still winnable.

Really, I agree, it doesn't determine whether the Nexus explodes or not. Game isn't coded so that the enemy team automatically surrenders when you're like 11/0. Mechanics are great, they're a way to taking objectives, but it definitely doesn't win all your games. Everyone is all hype about FoTM champs, latest builds, OP stuff. That can take you up to a certain degree

Lastly

1. My team manages to countergank enemy team, but the enemy jungler doesn't know this. He thinks we're jungling. I ping for them to stay in the bush and not recall. Moments later, as predicted, enemy jungler comes in and facechecks. Combined with the CC, and the instant 3v1, he dies. Enemy team surrenders immediately, and yes

2. I gank bot lane early and net bot lane a first blood off enemy Sona.  I decide to recall in bottom bush (blue side), and there was the second kill of the game, not to mention that bot lane was pretty much over at that point and after focusing top and mid lanes, game ended with Nexus blowing up before 30 minutes. A huge contribution mainly due to the fact I decided to stay that extra five seconds.

Every small thing counts. That one missed ult that could change a teamfight. That one decision to take a tower to net your mid an early Deathcap. They all stack up. Learn to take the initiative.

And that is all.

1362192592.0,19i3vw,Quinn first impressions from a diamond 1 player.,Muffit,59,11,73,"Hey guys

So first off, might be able to be built bruiser-ish top but that remains to be seen.

Let's cover the abilties.

The passive is pretty unique and very fun, giving you attack speed with W's passive. It seems choppy sometimes (prioritizes high hp minions over low, even tho it should prioritize the low ones), but it's still a really solid harassing tool, and it makes csing easier.

Q is a skillshot blind that gets blocked by minions. Missile speed is brand Q-like

W has a passive that gives you attack speed when you attack a marked target

E is a honestly the ability i'm the most dissapointed by atm. It's really fun but it bugs out alot. It jumps to your target, it should place you further away and vice versa, but it doesn't really do that atm. It's a really REALLY cool ability that can be used to a HUGE potential. Example: i was chased by the enemy xin from bot, got forced into the dragon pit with flash down and i thought i was done. Not so much, i managed to E the xin, jumping me over the dragon wall into safety. I tried to duplicate this but it's really hard to do, since the range is so weird and it's still quite buggy. Think tristana jump.


R is really weird, making you melee, gives you huge movespeed (decays in combat), and makes your Q a small aoe, same effect.  W gives more attack speed when you attack a marked (vurnerable) target. E rushes to your target, but does not jump back, so you need to use this carefully; it's an all-in ability. Activating R a second time will rain a hail of arrows around you, elise spider form q etc.). The damage seems really lackluster and the range is quite low. I feel like this is a chasedown ultimate only, so be sure to be really really careful with this.



Skill order R&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q

I think W is the best to level first due to the attack speed steroid. Reduced cd on active is nice too

E lowers the cd

Q can be upped second

R whenever


Items: The new botrk. It is SO powerful on ad carries and it synergizes great with your kit. You can E in

Start dorans/boots+3/long sword+2. i reccomend dorans since it gives you the most stats and makes you weak to dorans counters if you started any other items. Start boots/longsword if you love pots instead of the auto attack sustain.

Rush blidgewater into instant bork. Get attack speed boots.

After this you should get IE or statikk shiv. IE will give you HUGE damage, since your enemies should have some armor now. After this you should get the part you didnt get before(IE/statikk/pd). Finish your build with warmogs/ga, or bloodthirster if you're a real baller. 

botrk-&gt;zerks-&gt;ie-&gt;lw-&gt;pd-&gt;warmogs is the ideal build.

Boot enchant is furor or homeguard.

I was duo'ing with a friend today. I was top lane

But we still lost. 

Our team sucked. We had a trynd jungle who waited way to long for ganks

This was versus an olaf, skarner and Lux. 

After the game we analysed it (which we always do

Obviously our team comp wasn't really ideal, etc)).  

We came to the stage where we're thinking:

""I don't understand how high ELO players can carry in this situation

After thinking about it, I would have dropped top tower, gone bot and dropped that, then dragon and mid tower, and so on. We forgot to look further ahead and just focused on winning our current situation, and not thinking how it would affect the rest of the game.

I really think that if we had done what I said above

And this might be really obvious to some people

Carrying isn't restricted to high kills and high CS.

I went into my next game with as positive an attitude as I could muster

Top lane teemo lost to singed pretty early on (teemo is the counter to singed..), and ez + blitzcrank were bot vs Ali + draven. Bot lane was pretty scrappy and they traded kills, so it was about even.

But from looking at the team comp alone, as they get more damage. Katarina will not do well vs the stuns, disables and silences of their team, Singed will keep getting stronger and really harass our team, while being hard to kill, Shen will be able to split push and Ulti to people, and Ez will get fed. 

So I decided to take control. Put pressure on mid to help kat get farm, but we did it. 

Next was mid, chasing for kills etc. But I kept focusing on taking the objectives.

And we won. It's probably the hardest I've ever carried a game (and I've carried a LOT). Normally I carry by being fed and just being able to blow people up

And I think that's something anyone can do. It didn't take great mechanics

I know this post was super long and constructed terribly

I really think that just having this kind of mindset will really help. Flaming your team mates for feeding never makes them play better, take control. End your laning phase (I know it's tempting to stretch it out if you're winning), start impacting the other lanes. CARRY.

1347815176.0,zz6z6,When is getting a kill not worth it? Lets do some Math,,59,14,16,"One thing new player should learn IMO is when is a kill not worth it.

First off we are going to discuss threat:

Threat aka bounty is the value of an enemy champion in gold compared to base value of 300. Threat increases on kills and decreases on deaths. Threat is uneffected by multi-kills

http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kill

A bounty table can be found at the link above. With the exception of First Blood all base line kills are worth 300 gold. After any kill streak or deathstreak is reset the value returns to 300.

So for example 0/4/0 is worth 135 gold (5th death on bounty list) upon death. However if they get 1 kill they reset to 300. If they get 2 kills they remain at 300 apposed to increasing to 330. This is cause the reset is not included in the streak. 

The same goes for a player who is 5/0/0 if they die they return to 300 they do not reduce to 273 until they die again. 

Assists are worth 7/12th (58.33% for those who hate fractions) a kill or at base level 175 and on first blood 233. Assist value are directly related to kill values. Assist gold is equaly spilt rounding up on the last assister. So 2 assisters worth 175 total provides 87 &amp; 88 respectively. The portrait closest to the kill portrait earns the extra 1 gold.

Assist only increase threat if they are currently on a death streak. 2 assists will increase your threat 1 level but never past 300 bounty. Example 0/5/0 goes 0/5/2 bounty is worth 135 not 106. 

So why is this important? 

Well lets say we have a 0/3/0 top lane champion. Gold lost to enemy champion (excluding missed CS score) is 300 + 273 + 216 = 789
Now this champion kills the enemy champion with an assist from the jungler. He earns 363 and the jungler earns 212 = 575. The global difference is 214 or approximately 7 CS.

The Kill/Death ratios are: 3.0 and 0.33 but the gold which matters is minimal. 

This is a very interesting thing to look at. Often people are called feeders cause they are 0/3/0 for example. They provided 789. But someone who goes 3/3/0 provides 789 to 936 gold depending on the order of their kills and deaths. So in reality the 3/3/0 is the feeder. 

Now this isn't the whole story experience plays a role as well right? 

http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_(champion)

""The experience gained is equal to 75% of the total experience required for a champion to go from the slain champion's current level to the next level up. In other words, or 862.5 experience points."" 

Getting kills on someone a lower level then you earns less ecperience the larger the gap. At a 2 level gap the experience earn by the lower level champ is between 125 - 175% of the experience in the opposite exchange.  

However if this is assisted the experience is equally spilt between the number of assisting champions. So a 4 man gank is worth minimal experience vs a one on one exchange. 

So when is it ""worth it""?

First off any exchange where you get a kill and an assist vs a kill is worth it (assuming bounties are at base or higher) At a 4 death streak killing someone increases your bounty by more then they are worth in gold to you. At 5 the gold earned from a kill and an assist is worth less then the increase in your bounty.

So a player with a high K/D rating could earn less gold then one with a low one depending on how much gold is exchanged. 

In short KDR (kill death ratio) is a pointless stat as there are too many variables who aren't accounted for.

**Farming**

Farming is the act of CSing

 * The importance of this is monumental to your success in a game for it affects your DMG Potential, etc.

 * It allows you to catch back up if you're at a gold disadvantage, i.e. possibly allowing the enemy ADC to finish his/her Infinity Edge before your ADC finishes his/her's. Start farming to catch up. 

 * To practice CSing, so learning each champion's ""groove"" when last hitting is a key to success.

 * Even when doing that though, for you have to not only focus on farming, but **also** on map awareness, responding to pressure from enemy lane aggro, your HP, etc. So, although I recommend to do the 20 minutes in a custom game

 * Never stop farming throughout the whole game, i.e. Fort. Pot, Oracle's. etc.  

**Important** - Remember what you're farming for. Items. Which items specifically? The items that are best for the current situation you're in. It also helps immensely if you know the amount of Gold needed till you complete a big ticket item, Athene's Holy Grail. 

 * Also, e.g. you may type ""500 g till DFG for enemy Caitlyn,"" which may make your team ""stall"" while you go and farm that quickly and then buy it. Communication is key guys, always, always communicate with your team. 

Hope you guys enjoyed today's Tip for Success, feel free to PM me here on Reddit and I'll do my best to answer your question. Happy League-ing! :)

If this gets enough attention

I'll start. I play mid and I mained Evelynn for around a month and Katarina for a few months so I'd like to share some tips with those champions and all other roles because I've mained every role (except jungle) before my swap to Mid :]

**Evelynn**

* Your ultimate has a small delay before the shield actually goes off

* Your builds will ALWAYS be different from game to game. For example, a magic penetration build is strong to help deal as much damage as possible to them (Liandra/Abyssal/Rylai/Void Staff) and be able to survive the fight as long as them. If the threat is spread across the enemy team, a raw damage with a bit of tankiness build is highly viable to be able to have the largest multi-target damage possible (with huge R dmg and spammable high damage Qs) such as Rabadon-&gt;Rylai or something along those lines.

* Roam early if top or bot is being pushed by the enemy early. NOBODY expects this. I can't tell you how many times I've rushed Doran's Ring at level 1, Akali, or champions without an escape mechanism/flash. However, I wouldn't recommend roaming at level 2 if top or bot doesn't end up pushing because if you fail the gank, you will fall a huge margin behind in lane.

* Don't forget your W gets a reset on kill or assist. This is very useful for chasing enemies in a teamfight. Also remember to time your Ws (if you get resets) that you get the longest amount of high-MS as possible.


**Katarina**

* As tempting as it may be just to E into the teamfight and spin to win

* Sometimes you should let your team die before you engage a fight. Katarina is strongest when the enemies are chunked low from a fight.

* Katarina is played best on an AoE damage team comp because generally an AoE composition is good at chunking enemies for the people like the AD carry to clean up and generally keeps the enemy on the defensive. With this comp (as stated above) Katarina will dominate a fight by cleaning up the mess left from all the chunked people.

* I'm not going to say this is the best thing to do

* ALWAYS. CARRY. WARDS. Holy crap, you should always do this on Katarina and buy an extra 1-2 on her too because wards are literally a free gank-escaper if you place one and shunpo to it across a wall or toward your turret. Trust me.


The next tips I'll give are just some general basics of each lane I've mained that I feel should be said. This is what I mainly created this thread to share (as in these types of tips

**Mid lane**

* Roam. ROAM. ROAAAAAAMMM. I feel like this is THE defining feature of a good middle laner is their skill of roaming. Knowing when to roam and the effectiveness of roaming is what can seperate a won game from a loss game. Notice when lanes are pushed

* If you can't roam, blue, minions, towers, whatever you can. If you have no infleunce over your side lane then you must crush your own lane on top of farming your best also. You will not be able to carry the lane alone through farm. You have to crush your lane and zone him, make him useless.

* Know your strong points. For example, some 9, and some not at all until 11-18. For example, pantheon's strongest point is 1-4 (although this is debatable because of black cleaver, or getting fed). Riven's strongest point if 1 to 7 (level 6 damage is ridiculous). Karthus' point is once he maxes Q and gets level 2 ult (11+) and so on. Know your strong points and manipulate them going hard when you hit it, same thing goes for your enemy. Know your ENEMY'S strong points and strike before or after it when they're weak. Example being punishing Vladimir around 1-5 before he gets a high level in Q when his sustain becomes out of hand. And so on.

**Top lane**

* This lane snowballs HARD. Probably the hardest in the entire game. You mess up and give olaf first blood? Guess what he's back into lane with a giants belt compared to your one 500g item or something. Suddenly

* Don't just sit there! If you're pushed up to an enemy tower and they're just freezing it there do NOT just stay there, make plays, take dragon. You can't just sit top or you're wasting your time. Punish them for freezing the lane. Make them push it back to where you want the lane, then freeze it at your own tower but be prepared to instantly shove it to enemy tower if you see them leave. However, if you're against a weak pusher like Shen or Poppy, shoving to enemy tower and roaming is an insanely strong tactic since you are likely not going to get kills in that lane anyway.

* Know your team, BUILD DAMAGE. Most top laners can be successful both a damage and tank role so make sure you pay attention to what your team needs and adapt for it.

**For ALL lanes**

* WATCH YOUR ENEMIES COOLDOWNS. THIS INCLUDES SUMMONERS. Know exactly when enemy spells are on cooldown and abuse them while they're down if its one of their main damage spells. For example, heal/ignite) make your jungler gank for free kills. Know your enemies and capitalize on their mistakes.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this post and I hope you guys have learned something new and I also hope that you guys will submit tips of your own in the comment section! This post is becoming close to being max-length so I'll write up the bot lane tips and submit them in the comment section if this thread gets enough attention.

When your autoattack is off cooldown, you can't be autoattacking something two second before you intend to last hit a minion. If you do

Another thing to consider is projectile travel time. If you are standing next to the minion you are about to attack as a ranged character

Also, it makes it harder to time your last hits correctly. However, there is a plus to having slow moving projectiles. It makes it easier to harass someone under turret and retreat before pulling turret aggro.

Riot did a pretty great job at giving the player a ton of options to customize their champions.  Different items, and masteries can be combined to suit your role or playstyle.

This is why people say Clarity is bad.  This is why you don't build damage on your supports, you don't stack Archangels, and you don't get GP10 items on everybody.  In order to label item builds as good or bad, you have to **compare what you're trying to accomplish with the potential alternatives**.

**tl;dr - build choices are ""bad"" because other things are better

**More in-depth example + theorycrafting 101 below:**

If you're a ranged AD carry, AND crits for days.  So now, we weigh the other benefits of FroMal versus IE to see how they compare:

**Frozen Mallet**

* 20 AD
* 700 HP
* 30% slow on every AA (40% for melee

**Infinity Edge**

* 80 AD
* 25% Crit Change
* +50% Crit Damage

The AD balances itself out easily - IE is +60 AD over FroMal.  So we're left with the rest - how does 700 HP and 30% slow compare to 25% crit chance and +50% crit damage?  It's we could try to view this empirically without lots of math (which is totally doable, well, ranged, so survivability is less important.  The slow is a nice bonus, good for chasing down those stragglers, but **chasing down stragglers is not as important as doing da damages**.

In this case, the alternative would be Phantom Dancer for the AtSpd and Crit chance (which IE loves so very much), and we immediately see that doing more damage with PD is more important than tanking with FroMal.  So on and so on, until we're left with the standard AD carry build - IE, PD, LW, etc,,True,t3_sb3lt

1) Reading dying Creeps as a Support/ADC and harassing

Most people in Bronze/Silver know they NEED to harass but don't know how or when is the time to do it. An extremely effective way to make your enemy ADC lose CS is to use your allied dying creeps

For example, to last hit it. Therefore you can react, position yourself into range, and just before the enemy stops (this will take some experience, knowing the AA range of different champs is important) fire off your harass. This achieves one of two things;

1) Your harass connects with the enemy

2) You fire off your harass and the enemy dodges it

Both of thesse outcomes is a positive gain for your duo in bot lane. I find the caster minions (minions who shoot the spells out of their wands) to be most effective using this strategy. Stand on or very close to the dying creeps

2) Ganking right when the enemy goes to CS

Too often I see wasted ganks because the jungler is impatient or just has little knowledge of how and when they should gank. One of the most effective ways is using your own dying creeps to know where the enemy is going to move

For example, plan an escape strategy, and haul ass back to their turret.

If you wait for them to go last hit a creep, this is when you want to rush in and attack. As by the time the enemy has looked at the minimap you're already half way to him. 

Now this doesn't make a huge difference

1373794538.0,1i9pdz,A few tips and a short guide on supporting,FX4568,61,16,54,"Hi I am a main adc/support player.

This is a simple tip and guide for the people who are forced to support. 

I really notice in my ranked games (I am around gold 3/4) that not many people know how to support. I really think someone with a silver/bronze mechanics and game knowledge can reach gold by knowing how to support since not many people know how to do it. 

I understand gold 3 is not that much big of a deal to anyone

1. Wards. Your existence is all about wards. 
Always ward the tri-bush and dragon. 
If your lane is pushing a lot
If you are the purple side and you're pushing, warding enemy red is also a good idea. 
When doing dragon
When doing baron, you want to see a lux ult. 
In the blue side doing baron
After a turret gets taken
Always ward the wraith bushes. When the game goes over 25 minutes
When sieging tier 3 towers
Never ever leave the base without wards. Sightstone doesn't count. 
People tend to say that everyone should ward. That is true

2. No matter what is going on in a team fight
Unless you are leona and you are terribly ahead

3. During laning phase

4. Don't touch your adc's farm. If he is gone

5. Always ward objectives. The game isn't about kills. It's about global gold and the nexus. 

6. Try not building bulwark. Instead

7. Your masteries should be 1/14/15 (optimally). Do not run 9/0/21. It's okay to run 0/30/0 in champs like leona

8. I will not even talk about runes since you probably don't support often.

9. Your normal start should be biscuit, reju bead/faerie, 2 wards and a pink. 

10. Every time you recall, but tell your adc so he can play safer. 

11. Some adcs are bad. No matter how good you are

12. Do not go Nidalee support. The whole point of a support in my idea is to have a skill that will allow the adc to have some ""oh shit"" recovery time. You see a hecarim ult? thresh can lantern or ult, zyra can snare. What does nidalee do? Poke and heal. If you must nidalee support, go back to lane at least with 2 wards each time.

13. This is generally how my build goes for support. 
Initial items &gt; finish philostone &gt; finish red sightstone &gt; boots &gt; tons of wards &gt; oracles &gt; tons of wards &gt; oracles &gt; tier 2 boots (mobility or CDR) &gt; more wards &gt; more wards &gt; oracles &gt; wards &gt; (around 40 minutes) upgrade philostone into something &gt; wards &gt; locket. 

14. You should buy an oracle around 15 minutes. They don't go away if you die

Anyways, it's really really fun. Your adc will know when the lane was won because of you. 

Hope this helped.

Edit 1 Jul 14 19.24hrs

So regarding my starting items, and a philo stone that is not evolved for at least 30 minutes, coupled with gp10 quints with utility masteries is insane. 
You can get an extra 2 wards instead of the faerie charm, sona) and some poke (nami/sona) we see that 2 wards really do not produce much efficiency. 
Let us say you put the ward down at 3:15 (placing the 1 minute ward at 2:15) and you are purple side (which is pretty early if you KNOW the jungler will take blue &gt; red) ward will expire at 6:15, 1 ward can go in either lane bush or dragon which will be placed around 3:30 / 4:30, which will last to 6:30 / 7:30. 
If you are blue side, and that should last until 8/9 minutes. with 1 ward placed in either lane bush or even further out to mid lane. My point about ward timers is also based on the fact of communication, solo queue communication of ward placement is near null. Ganks are not coordinated, and you can exploit this lack of communication with a little riskier play.

Anyways

I cannot answer question about, since I don't know enough of the other roles to be helpful.

I have recently gotten an overwhelming amount of requests for help, however, that many players are struggling over the same few stuff. I have answered and talked about the same questions over pms recently, and figured this thread could be a good idea? Let's see if it works! :)

Made the thread so I could forward you here and help you guys, to determine how should I help you over the messages, and where do you stand as an adc:

Are you dying in the lanephase? Are you getting underleveled in the laning phase, or often winning games when you're losing lane? Then, anything you think you're having problems with ad carrying yourself? Where do you yourself think you prosper at, what are your strong points? 

PS. I give advice from my experience, I know. My advice is just something that I know that works, and makes people get better, its not the absolutely advice and there are many different paths to getting good at this game and enjoying playing it!

 - Fingod


**EDIT: Here's something I've gathered so far:**

There are no easy tips or guides on itemization. The best guideline I can tell you is this:

**""As Adc, because staying alive means you will do more damage, than having that IE+LW+PD but dying instantly.**

You can also convert this guideline to laningphase, and buy damage if you think you will otherwise get outraded by that vayne's insane damage output.

Most of all; Use your brains, and Think if there could be a better option.


**When enemy bruiser is fed**, tell them to just instakill him when he joins the fray. 2. Stay All The Way Back in the teamfight. By this I mean, in the previous example, if you're 9-0 Varus against 12-0 Jax. You use Q and E (perhaps ultimate) and NO AUTOATTACKS (I know, it hurts not to aa) UNTIL the said Jax has used jump/any gapclosing abilities/summoners he might possible have on somebody else. After he has used them, you go and kill that said bruiser. Alternatively, you can try to position yourself so you can hit Hecarim, you can go away from him and instead kill the jungler

Also, you need to buy survivability items. Fast giant's belt can do wonders.

**Trades** are a difficult question, there are couple easy advantages to notice though;

Lvls, most probably, win the trade. Items, if the enemy has double doran's against your boots, he will win the trade. Burst versus poke, if you have sona support and enemy has leona, as long as you don't die with the sona support, but make sure that if they focus your Sona

**Positioning:** It's hard to say general advice to this, kill hero"" Which means, you just attacks anybody who is close to you, no matter what your team wants to ""focus"". Ad carries don't have such a thing as ""focus"" You attack anybody who comes to range, and kite in order to keep them at that range. If you make one chamion low hp, and he runs away, but another one comes closer to you, there are situations where this would be a bad choice

Repositioning via skills and summoners; Try to save them as long as you can, reposition yourself with a skill you have, such as Caitlyn's E. With longrange ad carries such as Caitlyn, most preferable positions would be over some wall, where the enemy will have to use a gapcloser to get to, and if they don't have one, you will be safe and free to autoattack everybody. Use summoner spells as the Last Resort. Do Not Waste Them. Not on lane and not in teamfights. Only use them when it's inevitable that if you don't, repositioning behind walls is good

Zoning; again

While **zoning**, make sure you don't miss any! As long as you don't miss any cs, you need to see how your own minion's health bars are going down. When you see your own side's minion going down, make sure to show yourself aggressive, and prepare; if the enemy goes to take that cs, you ditch out damage to him. (on extreme cases you can even do this on exp, if the enemy goes near enough to get exp you are there to AA him)

Since he will need to autoattack the creep in order to get the lasthit, or if he decides to hit you instead, he will have missed the cs=profit.


**RECALLING**The point where you Want to recall, not just close to it) and when the wave after this one will have a siege minion in it. If you recall straight after you have done this, you will perhaps only miss 1-2 cs while you have recalled. This is often something that determines who wins the lane, as the one who gets to recall at the most optimal times will have higher cs and higher exp in general.

However, it's better to lose cs and exp instead of dying AND losing that cs and exp!

It's also a decent time to recall, pushing a wave to the enemy turret while the enemy is recalled, even if the next wave has no siege minions in it will be a good time to recall. If you need to recall when the enemy is still in lane, try to have a big wave (atleast a siege minion in it, perhaps more than just 3 casters as well) and shove it all the way down to the enemy turret, and recall fast in a bush where there are no enemy wards (will buy you couple extra seconds hopefully, as the enemy is confused)

Other than this, in which case is one of the worst times to recall).

It's hard to list all the good, you can always look at the lane and see how many cs you die, and see what you could've done differently in order to not lose so much!

The EXP difference can also result from the enemy laners doing golems, starting from lvl 1 golems which will get them lvl 2 faster.** (danger zone here, beaware of this tactic)**


**21-0-9 and 21-1-8** (taking barrier mastery from defense tree when you're using barrier) Is Very strong mastery build.

Doing this, or kill or non, in a game, where you otherwise might miss that 5 mana for a skill. Manaregen is considered being stronger than that extra armor in defense tree because of this, as the armor will make you last perhaps 1 extra AA, usually not even that.

What makes the utility tree even Stronger, than the enemy who doesn't use the utility masteries. This 30 seconds gap on barrier/flash you both used at the same time previously, will not be a huge advantage, and 30 seconds where you can kill/out-trade the enemy.

**19-0-11**The extra 2 points in utility will mean you will have Even More lifesteal, and therefore hopefully ensure you get more farm/trade better/have higher hp when the enemy engages on you.

Lifesteal set up basically just keeps your hp higher in lane. So, and let you get more farm than what you would otherwise.

**When you are ahead in lane

**1. You freeze the lane and zone

**2. You push down the turret hard**

If you decide to use tactic 1, when it's more important to shut them down rather than help your team with global gold.

If you decide to follow tactic 2, on general occasions, have 3 options.

1. If you have a strong early game skills, you **call your jungler, pink ward dragon and do it.** After this you see if the enemy bot lane is pushing, if it is, go depush it and go to tactic 2. or 3.

2. If number one is not doable(jungler is top, something else) you need to see what kind of a mid laner you are against. **If the enemy mid laner has non/not enough/low range wave clear, call your support and go push mid.** While doing this, you need to keep an eye on what your enemy in bot lane is doing. If he's not pushing the lane (freezing perhaps?) continue pushing the mid turret down. If he starts pushing towards your turret, you need to time your mid lane pushing, so you start moving towards bot lane IN TIME to clear the wave the enemy is pushing BEFORE it hits your turret and starts dying. **(This is the way you also keep up in CS in the mid game you were talking about)**

**3. You go to your own jungle, you need to go back to lane, push the wave again, and then repeat, doing the camps or number 1. or 2.

All this is, many of them actually, but you will learn them in time. **Do remember, as long as you wont lose mid turret or baron for it, always go clear the bot lane wave before it pushes into your own turret and start dying. This way you will keep up with the cs count!**

**Lifesteal quints are really good on certain occasions.** It's not as much about the range of your adc, when that leona engages on you or your support, you will be doing more damage than you would otherwise do, and therefore helping you to win trades.

Again, yes the LS quints are very good and they will help ensure you get more cs than normally, and regen your hp from the trades. Obviously the LS quints are also good on multiple shortengage lanes, such as taric or lulu, where constant regeneration is needed.

1363024332.0,1a3dnb,Something I worked out for practicing Orb Walking (must read for adc players),NaT3z,58,15,23,"I don't know about anyone else but with my minimum 207ms ping, first I will explain orb walking (skip if you know). Orb walking is the interrupting of the autoattack animation and moving to maximise both movement and attack speed. This is generally done by using attack click (A click) then right clicking immediately after the autoattack has cast to interrupt the animation. If you want to attack someone chasing (generally the closest one)

The tip:

BUY DRAVEN. I don't know if many people have shared or agree with this, the axe will move exactly in the direction that you move in this time.

As a result, you know that you are orbwalking because if you wait for the animation to cast, it hits the target and the axe moves randomly but if you move, it will go in the direction you moved. Draven has relatively high scaling attack speed per level so playing him gives you experience orb-walking with a range of attack speeds and if you build a phantom dancer, experience with even higher attack speeds.

Then create for carrys when you are using ignite/exaust, and another one for carries when you don't are using ignite/exhaust. Create one page for that particular champion, if you feel that he needs some specific stats (like Singed, in my case). Just take a time and make a full use of your masteries.

What am I talking about? THIS:
1. You get 4000 rp and 10000 ip on your beta account
2. You will be lvl 30 right when you start. This means you can build your runepages rightaway. (Might take a while until your account will be set to lvl 30)
3. Your RP/ip will regain 4000/10000 rp/ip every 2. week (someone stated it was every sunday, which is in english]) it is every 2. week.

So what is the use of the PBE?
Well, try out new skins and more!
If riot keeps on updating the PBE you will even be able to try out the newest champ which will come out for 1rp so EVERYONE can buy and test him.
Unfortunately

Of course riot wants you to do something to. You should keep your eyes out for bugs

I hope you learned something new and useful.
Have a nice day.

Edit2:

    Am I a good fit for PBE? PBE is not a place for serious competition or a place to try out new champions. It is a test environment where &gt;our players can help report bugs and give us feedback on changes we are implementing before it goes on the &gt;regular servers. We are looking for patient players with strong attention to detail to help us out.

I found this in the original post. I have to disagree with this strongly (event though it comes from a red).
It clearly says it is not a place to try out new champions
Finding bugs requires people to try new things (new item builds just to see if the champion is bugged with a certain item [ I kinda remember GA not working on champs like yorick
I implemented this just in case someone gets cocky and actually reads the red post :))

1325097440.0,ntufx,"Basic ""Rules of Thumb"" for beginners.",KaOticKay,62,14,39,"* 1: Farming the minions (aka cs'ing):

While it is VERY nice getting those kills during early/mid game.. it is **not** as important as farming. If you have the opportunity to kill an enemy (say thanks to a gank from another lane/jungler) then by all means take it.. but never assume you need to continue killing the enemy. Eventually those kills will give you less and less gold

  - That being said I need to add the following as well:
Let your minions attack their minions and when you see one super low


                                                 Tips on last hitting:

* Auto attack a caster minion and melee minion and take a mental note of how much damage you do (makes it easier to get used to last hitting especially if you are just starting out or you are switching between roles)

* Attack animation cancelling: practice attacking and then immediately clicking away so your character doesn't use the full animation but still attacks. Very important when playing AD carry since they mainly kite their opponents

* [AD/SOLO TOP] Using the brush: It is also very beneficial to take advantage of the brush while last hitting. Stay in the brush, and go back in the brush. It is good practice as you can also harass your opponent and walk back in the brush without aggro - ing minions. Don't do this if you are vs ing someone who takes advantage of walls.

* Its really good to practice last hitting in a custom game.


---- This is a little more advanced but it is definitely something worth practicing. If you want to get better at the game this is definitely one way to do so. xzephy is a genius! Thank you for this suggestion.

* Also

* OP also said, etc as a way to harm you. Two champions I can think of at the top of my head that do this are Vayne and Poppy. Both of these champions can smash you into a wall and stun you.

**________________________________________________**

* 2: **WARDING** This is a HUGE one.

Through the whole game it is **very** important to ward. (You can find wards in the Consumables tab in the shop). Knowing where your enemy is at all times gives your team a huge advantage. It will stop your team from randomly ""face checking"" a bush only to find all of the enemy team waiting there... What a lot of people need to realize is *ONE* simple mistake can throw the game for the entire team. Buy wards as often as possible and learn the best placement of these wards to benefit your team. (I learned it from watching a bunch of live streams on: clgaming.net

- Side note:

The *green* wards are just for the basic vision. They last for 3 minutes once placed. The enemy will not know they're there (unless you place them down right in front of their face) and you'll have vision on them trying to gank you. 

The *pink* wards are a bit more expensive but the reason behind this is because they give you vision of **invisible champs/objects.** (Such as: Twitch, Teemo [or his mushrooms], etc) Just as the green wards these only last 3 minutes AND they can give you vision of an enemy team wards if you place them by or near their wards. This gives you the advantage because you can kill their ward, leaving them with no vision of that area til they lay a new one down. Which, by then your whole team could be waiting in a bush and kill them while they are trying to lay down the ward. 

**________________________________________________**

* 3: Know your enemy

I suggest reading up on all the champions in the game before you jump head first into it. There is a lot and yes I do understand that this can take some time and a lot of patience.. but it will benefit you in the long run. The best example I can give in this type of situation is if you have to go mid against a champion with a lot of cc (crowd control: stuns, etc) and you have a champion with little to no cc. Changes are you're going to fail that lane. You also need to know their range compared to yours. ""Would it be safe for me to run out there and hit this minion, or should I just let them push to my tower and farm off of my tower?"" 

The best champion example I can give of this type of situation is if the enemy is Xerath and you're playing AP Sion. While Sion's shield can be good, Sion has 1 stun while Xerath has a few... Xerath can either hit you with his E then his Q and you're stunned.. or he can simple W (increase his range), Q, and nail you with his 3 ulti's stunning you for some time. I am not saying that Xerath v Sion is a bad idea but I am saying that a good Xerath would win the lane hands down. 

**________________________________________________**

* 4. Buffs

What many newer people do not realize is the importance of buffs and Baron/dragon control. In each side of the jungle there's a [Blue Buff](http://i21.servimg.com/u/f21/16/41/48/26/blue_b10.jpg) and [Red Buff](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnEFiuLsbR_12SZUIsXWMftyxafgCC8Zd2IMMLT2oJdFlEuAzRnkMP9HYqeA) as well as [Wraiths - Do not give you a buff](http://i46.tinypic.com/1zn4xlw.png)

[Dragon](http://i48.tinypic.com/n4wiol.jpg) is very important early to mid game. Dragon spawns 2 minutes 30 seconds into the game and if killed by either of the teams each player on said team will receive 190g. This is actually very important to control if the enemy team is already ahead of you in kills and farming. His death timer is 6 minutes. So for instance

[Baron Nashor](http://media.mahalo.com/upload/5/5c/fac8e64c4d087efb8912e1c900da7253_20110212.JPEG) is


Blue buff is mainly used on AP casters.. however it can be used on anyone. Blue buff is ment to keep the mana up on the champion who has it. If the champion does not use mana then they get a really good cool down reduction.. What this mean is their ability timers are lessened. So if their ability before blue buff had a 4 second cool down.. it may now have a 2 second cool down. 

Red buff adds a little extra damage to the person who has it on and if it's on a ranged champion it adds a slow. This is actually very useful on an AD Carry (such as Vayne, etc)

Now if any of this was confusing please let me simplify it for you:

* Blue and red buff respawn in **5 minutes** after they are killed.

     * Buff duration is 2 minutes 30 seconds *without* the Runic Affinity mastery.. 3 minutes with it.
                                                  (Thank you ishake_well!!!)
 
* Wraiths respawn every **50 seconds** (Thank you valete1510!!)

* Wolves and Gollums respawn every **1 minute.**

* Dragon respawns **6 minutes** after he is killed.

* Baron respawns **7 minutes** after he is killed.

Being that the ones reading this are lower levels, dragon and Baron you'll be amazed at how strong your team gets and how fast the game could end. 

Us ""seasoned players"" tend to pink ward Baron and Dragon. This gives us the ability to clear any wards the enemy team may have by them. Because honestly, even their own. So if your team is controlling the map it's a good idea to ward their buffs.. if an enemy goes to try to get the buff you and a few members of your team can go there to kill them and take the buff.. then you will know when it'll respawn.. so you can ward it once again before it spawns and kill them again if they go for it.

**When to do Baron/Dragon:**

Consider the following:

* a. How strong are we/how fast can we finish it/how strong is our jungler
* b. Did they ward it? (You can still do drag even if they did
* c. Can they beat us in a 5v5?
* d. Are they in/out of position? (EX. the enemy teams jungler is top lane and your jungler is bottom
* e. Do we have a TP top and they don't? (TP is a shortened version of the summoner spell [teleport](http://cdn1.mobafire.com/images/summoner-spell/teleport.png)
    
**Tip:** You also generally want to pull the dragon out (hit it and walk back a bit) esp. if your team is the top half of SR (Summoners Rift) to avoid steals and to put your team in a better position. You can easily get caught in that crater thingy.

This is really good advice, by all means try it!!! It is definitely something you need to learn. (Thanks again xzephy!!)


**________________________________________________**

* 5. Building correctly for the type of champion you are playing.. very important!

Being new it's hard to tell which item is good for who. So most of the time you either end up buying something completely random or you go with the recommended items. The recommended items aren't terrible.. but they're just the basic items for that champion. It's good to read up on the items and what they do. There's tons of items in the shop that counter certain champions and even builds. Knowing these items and what they do will give you a huge advantage over the enemy team. 

* For instance

* Some good websites to look up the ""basic"" builds (most of the time better then the recommended) are: [solomid.net](http://solomid.net/guides.php) or [clgaming.net](http://clgaming.net/guides)

**________________________________________________**

* 6. Never limit yourself on who you play!

When I first started I was playing Ashe. I can't tell you how long it took me to get enough guts to change from Ashe to a new champion. That new champion happened to be Akali.. took me months to get brave enough to turn my back on her. In the long run, etc) isn't very beneficial to you. While you're leveling up you should be experimenting with new champions and trying new things. So by the time you're level 30 you're not scared to enter into Ranked. Knowing more then one role will already put you ahead of the elo you start out at; skill wise. Practice and practice each role as much as possible. I do understand that is very hard to get enough IP for all the champions, I myself (after a year) am still missing 26 champions. Now this might not seem like a lot but I have a friend of mine to thank for that.. If not for him buying me enough RP to buy a champion bundle I would still be farther behind. Any way, try your best to know at least 3 champions for each role. Once you get into Ranked you never know if your limited champions you're good at will be banned. If they are, then you just basically left your team in a 4v5 team fight because you'll be playing someone you do not know or have limited knowledge of. 

(Thank you khjester for suggesting me to add this to this post!!!)

**________________________________________________**

* 7. Never be negative!!!!!

This is something I can not express to you enough. When you first start you have limited knowledge of the game so you're calm and collected. Just trying to learn and climb your way up that ladder. Once you start to learn more you begin to analyze everyone. This can be awesome

It is perfectly fine to say something in the lines of

It is not ok to say something in the lines of

**________________________________________________**

* 8: Map Awareness!!!! (Thanks xzephy!!)

This is actually something that will take some time to get used to

**ALWAYS, if you glance down at your mini map maybe after you get a cs or 2 then back to your lane, knowing your safe, you can continue to cs.If you look at that picture you will notice that there's green and red circles. On the mini map the *enemies* will be in red. Throughout the entire game it's definitely beneficial to keep glancing over at your map and counting those red circles. Do you count 2? Oh, that means that 3 are mia. So is it really safe to be where your standing .. or do you think it's best to step back til those circles appear back on your map? 

Another way to have excellent map awareness is by **warding.** I have already explained this in the warding section though. 

Some champions, please please please do not hold back on the wards if you need them.

I want to apologize for how incredibly long this thread is. I wanted to keep it simple and basically just go over the do's and dont's.. but slowly it's turned into this massive thing that I hope you've just taken the time to read. I do understand that all of this can be overwhelming and I apologize. Take your time to read through this... if you have to.. come back and read it again.

There is sooo much to this game that I honestly do not know if you could find someone who wouldn't take a long time to explain it all. It's all achieved and learned through *practice.* It is **OKAY** to forget something when you're new. Do not beat yourself up for it. Just learn from it.

I propose to you... **a challenge!**... kinda!

I want to do some premade draft normals with some people in this subreddit.  The idea is to play and to *learn*, not focused on the new hotness in our roles, or are too afraid to push the boundaries of our potential.

The idea is to get five people together to actually sit down and **focus** on being **better**, or are strong but difficult to play... or that we don't play enough matches to know all the counter picks and all the strategies we need to win lanes.

&gt; So, bronze or silver or gold or even higher than that if you want to join in.  I don't care who joins me, I just want to be able to focus on getting better at what *I* do, and if I can help other people in the process... what a bonus!

To participate

* You **must** download the [LoL Replay client.](http://www.leaguereplays.com/download/)  After the games

* You must play a ""viable"" champion for your role.  ADC Ahri might be fun

* You must not rage!  We will probably lose.. a lot..  Losing is part of the game and even pros lose.  Mistakes happen!  The less mistakes you do

* As for the not so harsh restrictions, because there is a right way to do it.  Hope isn't lost!

* You should also... have fun?  If you don't think this will be fun, then that's ok!

Are you guys up to it?  I personally play mid but I need a lot of help in other roles as well!  I will keep a list of people and their roles so we can organize once a week and do a few games each week and if there is enough interest

That's the challenge!  Leave your summoner name and we will organize soon!  Thanks for reading!  :)

1371468790.0,1gid77,"How i play Kayle, the top lane bully.",chrisal1,53,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1gid77/how_i_play_kayle_the_top_lane_bully/

Even though Kayle can be played differently and built AD or more AP oriented

First of all to play Kayle you need to have a specific mentality. You need to clear your mind

Laning Phase - 
What you want to do untill you hit lvl 2 is auto atk with melee atks if possible, every time he reaches for a creep or gets close. This is a different approach from the usual ""auto atk in melee form so you don't push your lane""

- How to properly harass with Kayle - 
*The most efficient way to harass with Kayle is activating E
*The second combo is straight up starting with Q

With Kayle you will most likely be the one commanding the lane early on so you need to keep in mind a few things.

- What to do when you are commanding the lane - 
*Ward and check the map frequently
*All-ing in with Ignite as early as lvl 2. The dmg potential with Ignite, E is huge. This will teach your opponent who's the boss of the lane and you will have easier time laning.
*Be aggressive, whenever he goes for that canion minion whenever your minions are at his tower. Bully him 24/7.
*Freezing and Zoning. The minion waves after you have pushed will eventually push back to your side,Q,E / W,Q,E ) every time he comes close.
*If your enemy is low ask your jungler for a gank from behind his tower and dive him
Optional - Pink ward and act as if your jungler is ganking
This is how you play Kayle as a Bully.

Advanced Kayle mechanics - engaging/disengaging.
Some champions are hard to bully and in a lot of situation you will find your engaging and disengaging abilities lackluster,Q,E and W back so he can't follow up thus making you take minimal dmg.
But these are two simple situations right?
Now put that knowledge in situations against certain champions, leaving you unable to reach him. If you use W just after his knock-back you will reach him and be able to harass him.
You want more examples?
When Jax activates stun and tries to jump you
Malphite slows and steals your speed
Singed uses slow to catch you
Nidalee tries to reach you with a jump
With the proper engages and disengages you will deal significantly more Dmg. The estabilished combos are E,W - W,Q,E - Q,E,W - W,Q

After the end of the early game you should be constantly pushing

In team fights - 
Kayle is decent at team fighting. She possesses a slow
I find my self initiating a lot of times because i have the ability to Q in and W out fast
In a team fight you need to be constantly dealing dmg and supporting your team-mates with heals and/or Ulti.
In team fights you always start with Q and follow up with E, or what most of your team-mates are focusing. 
Always heal whenever is up

Who and when do i ult? -
This is the question no Kayle player or anyone has answered with certainty. It's situational, failed a lot, i have flashed and done late ults saving a guy from dying to ignite or other bleeds/poison spells, i also have done late ults that cost us the team fight. I believe now i have mastered this mechanic and i present you how and when i use R.

In 1v1's - 
1st use, Zed ult's, Lux combos you, etc
2nd use, you want to ulti at that moment because you have the strongest Kayle you can get, Guinsoo's gives you extra 20% atk speed, 10% lifesteal and 10% spell vamp
3rd use, many people fall for this even in high level play

In team fights -
1st use, and it doesn't hurt your teams chances to win a fight, for example if your support gets hooked in a team fight and is certain death do not ulti him. This requires a immediate use of your Ulti. 
2nd use, your Ad Carry is not farmed yet. This requires ulting the moment they swap the focus on you or you got caught in the front line, generally you are not a priority target
3rd use, mostly go when your Ad Carry get's CC'd and the enemies are ready to jump on him.
4th use, people tend to focus the person that is getting hit by tower and blow everything on him making your ulti absorb thousands of dmg. This is the easiest of all, i personally prefer to ulti around mid health.



If you apply the knowledge given here you will be able to make use of Kayles kit at high percentage.

**Rune FAQ [Basic

* **Why should I get runes?**

Runes give you an undeniable advantage in League of Legends. A full

* **When should I get runes?**

Tier one runes are not a bad investment. They are extremely cheap and give good stats [about half of tier three runes]. Avoid tier two runes like the plague; they are overpriced and you'll replace them soon enough anyway. Once you hit level 20

* **I have only two rune pages

To be honest, one AD and one for Support.  After these three, you can (and should) add more pages based on your main role, based on your needs.

* **What should these three rune pages look like?**

[In game, blues are ""glyphs"", and quints are ""quintessences"".]

* *AP*: Magic Pen or Hybrid Pen reds, AP quints

* *AD*: AD reds, AD quints

* *Support*: Armor reds, Gold per 10 quints

These three pages cover 99% of all champions in the game.  There are some variations

* **I see pros use different runes

Simply enough

One reason why pros use different runes are a regional thing.  Some players in EU (namely Gambit

The biggest thing that people can debate all day is the Hybrid Pen reds for an APC.  The reason I suggest these is that you sacrifice minor amounts of magic pen to gain about 7 armor pen.  The reason this is good is that you *will* auto attack in lane

--------------------
**Rune FAQ [Advanced]**

* **What runepages should I have beyond the basic three?**

If you already have the basic runepages listed above

* *AD with Lifesteal:* AD reds, Lifesteal quints

This is best used when starting a Doran's blade vs. a lane with some poke and sustain [Sona, but it is much easier to sustain in lane.

* *Jungler:* Attack speed reds, Movespeed/AD/HP quints

Junglers have very flexible runes

* *Armor pen:* Armor pen reds, Armor pen/AD quints

Armor penetration received a huge buff recently; it now applies after percent penetration [Ex: if your opponent has 100 armor and you have 9% armor penetration + flat 10 armor pen

* *Early game cheese:* 8 AD reds + 1 Critical chance red, AD/lifesteal/armor pen quints

This is all about the cheese. Player using this runepage reason that the extra AD red will not make a huge difference

* **How much IP will I be spending on runes and runepages?**

Here I will calculate the cost of all the runepages we outlined above. For runes that we gave more than one choice

* *AP:* 12300 IP

* *AD:* 8610 IP

* *Support:* 7080 IP

* *AD with Lifesteal:* 11685 IP

* *Jungler:* 13530 IP

* *Armor pen:* 10455 IP

* *Early game cheese:* 8815 IP

* *5 additional rune pages:* 31500 IP or 2600 RP [7 pages]

* *Total [no overlapping]:* 37625 IP for runes + 31500 IP for pages = 69125 IP

* **How much gold in terms of stats do runes give me?**

Here I will calculate the the stats runes give you in terms of gold. All statistics are based off the lowest priced item in the game that gives said statistic. 

Basic item statistics [these stats are worth X amount of gold]: 

* 1 AD = 40 G [Long Sword]
* 1 AP = 21.75 G [Amplifying Tome]
* 1 Armor = 20 G [Cloth Armor]
* 1 Armor Pen = 133.7 G [Brutalizer]
* 1% Attack Speed = 33.3 G [Dagger]
* 1% Critical Chance = 50 G [Brawler's Gloves]
* 1 Gold per 10 = 140 G [Philosopher's Stone]
* 1 HP = 2.64 G [Ruby Crystal]
* 1% Lifesteal = 80 G [Vampiric Scepter]
* 1 Magic Pen =  73.3 G [Sorcerer's Shoes]
* 1 Magic Resist =  20 G [Null-Magic Mantle]

Value of runes in game [from those discussed in this post]:

REDS

* 9 AD reds: 8.55 AD = 342 G
* 9 Armor reds: 8.19 Armor = 163.8 G
* 9 Armor Penetration reds: 12 Ar.P = 1604.4 G
* 9 Attack Speed reds: 15% AS = 499.5 G
* 9 Critical Chance reds: 8.37 CC = 418.5 G
* 9 Magic Penetration reds: 7.8 Mag.P = 571.74 G

YELLOWS

* 9 Armor yellows: 13 Armor = 260 G

BLUES

* 9 AP blues: 10.71 AP = 232.94 G
* 9 Magic Resist blues: 12 MR = 240 G

QUINTESSENCES

* 3 AD quints: 6.75 AD = 270 G
* 3 AP quints: 15 AP = 326.25 G
* 3 Armor Pen quints: 7.8 Ar.P = 1042.86 G
* 3 Gold per 10 quints: 3 GP10 = 420 G
* 3 HP quints: 78 HP = 205.92 G
* 3 Lifesteal quints: 6% Lifesteal = 480 G


Value of a full runepage in game [order is red, quints]:

* AD page [AD, AD]: 1112 G
* AP page [Mpen, AP]: 1397.99 G
* Support page [Armor, GP10]: 1083.8 G
* Jungling page [Atk.spd, AD]: 1269.5 G
* Armor pen page [Ar.P, Ar.P]: 3147.26 G
* AD with Lifesteal page [AD, Lifesteal]: 1322 G 
* Cheese page [1 Crit chance/8 AD, AD]: 827.6 G

1362422185.0,19ngq8,I quit playing co-op and started playing only solo queue on my way to 30. Here is what I learned,zedbra,56,13,39,"I thought I would share some thoughts on my transition from co-op to solo queue on my way to playing ranked games. I am on [NA - Iriog](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23708847#history) and not very good

History: Even though I love competitive multiplayer my anxiety playing against people gets the best of me and if I am not playing with people I know I usually don't play. I loved played OG Dota at lan parties and have played LoL off an on for almost 3 years. Because of this anxiety when I played LoL I only played against bots. With the release of the new ladder system I really wanted to play ranked.  

I stuck to co-op since the people in game were generally easy going or silent with very little flaming. I am in no way bashing the bot system, and experimenting with champions. 

*My fears playing against people*

* Getting flamed by my own team
* The other team harassing through chat the whole time
* Losing
* Not playing well and losing games

I found out some of my friends played LoL and one night played 3 or 4 games with them. This is what I needed to break into playing against people and I will never co-op again. I felt I have learned a lot so I thought I should share some stuff I have learned

* All chat is disabled you don't see anything from the enemy team. You can imagine they are just bots
* You will play against different champions. My first game I was Trist against Draven and died a lot.
* People pretty much play whatever they want. So don't worry about following the meta. You should learn different roles because good team composition is always a good thing.
* Mute flamers
* Don't be afraid of communicating. Think it is a good time to Baron? Do it. Want to push mid
* Understand how champions abilities work in team fights
* Games are so much fun! Seriously a blast each game is different win or lose.

This has become a text wall

1361561050.0,191cgw,Case Study: Support Carry,Sixtox,52,7,35,"People tend to ask a lot ""Can supports carry?"". And I must answer with a resounding ""YES!""

I present to you **""The Case of the Pink Ward That Never Was""** (A fair warning that it is a bit of a read

I was watching a 1k Elo game the other day

The guy I was watching was supporting, when the better solution was a pink, green, pot x1 (and waiting a few more seconds for the few more gold necessary to make the purchase).

He was laning as Nunu (Partner MF) against Vayne/Leona. Everyone was even (Vayne just slightly ahead in items)

Friendly Nunu was standing in the close lane brush, and so didn't stray close enough to the non-visible bush for Leona to grab him and make his day very bad. Nice work!

However, probably enough to get out of laning phase at that point, or at least long enough to afford another B for more wards.

Two effects would come from this:

- He would have vision for 3 minutes

- Leona wouldn't have vision for 3 minutes

Now, and managed to gain control of the forward bush, the one that Leona had warded... the one that Nunu had not pinked.

If Nunu had pinked the bush, she was sitting in the bush as happy as a clam.

And then
Leona shot a Zenith blade out at MF, that vision would be there, and we take the leap of logic that MF would have successfully dodged this with the extra lead time).

Leona on MF

The Leona/Vayne pair is hard under turret, and the two make short work of him as well.

Double kill to Vayne.

Leona and Vayne go back to base and heal up.

Vayne purchases a vamp scepter.

Fast forward 5 minutes. That pink ward (that I argue would have prevented the double kill) would have long since expired. And yet it is still having an impact on the game.

The friendlies choose to take a dragon. All fine and dandy until Vayne shows up and goes to work. It's a 4v4, tumbling, condemning as she can. She gains a double kill, and escapes with 34 life. Two for nothing trade in favor of the hostiles, with a standstill at dragon.

But wait, that gold was what Vayne spent on the vamp scepter. That vamp scepter was the reason she lived to tell the tale (10% life steal, and she did far more than 340 damage during the teamfight, so the life she ran away with was stolen life). [Because of the way the fight worked out, she might have harvested 1 kill without the vamp scepter, but would have definitely died. I read the trade as a 2-1 in favor of the friendlies rather than a 0-2 against, if she didn't have the vamp scepter

So now we have a Vayne that is 4 kills up because of The Pink Ward that Never Was. And a Vayne with 4 kills more than she should have is a force to be reckoned with.

Oh

But I tell you, and might instead be down a dragon.

And that, if that pink ward was in fact set, to see for sure if that really was the turning point in the game.

Either way, like placing that pink ward, takes a blowout game and makes it closer. It takes a close game and tips it in your favor. Whatever is happening in the game, it shifts it more toward a possible win for your team. And in order to gain Elo, all you need to do is consistently shift the odds in your favor. Over time this leads to more wins -&gt; more Elo, and before you know it, you are a League of Legends rockstar.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Supports can carry their team. Just not in the way that other champions do.

1361296741.0,18tv3k,The free ELO guide to mid. How to play Twisted Fate correctly. ,dontsweattt,50,6,66,"Hey guys I am making a quick guide on Twisted Fate for solo Q. Twisted Fate is an exceptional pusher and with global presence makes him a terror in the game. Here are my credentials http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/415639 

Skills:
[Q] Wild Cards. Always max first regardless of the situation. Your hardest hitting ability until you get lich bane and max Pick a Card [W]

[W] Pick a Card. I have seen people max this 2nd and last

[E] Stacked Deck. Get at either level 2 or 3 and max last. Its is EXTREMELY important to auto attack opponents while your spells are on cooldown because of this spell. 

[R] Destiny. Allows you to teleport up to 5500 extra range. You can teleport to bot or top near Wolves/Banana bush. Keep this in mind when you are running to gank because you need a point in your head to think

Skill order:
W,Q,Q,R,Q,W,Q,R,E

(Get Q at level 2 if the opponent has already started to push the wave)

Build order:
There are two ways to early build Twisted Fate. 

Build 1: If you are able to get good ganks off build this way
- Boots x3 health bots
- Sheen
- Lich Bane
- Arm guard -&gt; Soc boots -&gt; hourglass
- Deathcap
- Void Staff
- Last item is up to you. Build defense if you need it such as warmogs or banshee vail. Want more damage you can get Twin Shadows for AP + MS

Build 2: Not/Cannot get ganks off efficiently 
- Boots x3 health pots
- 2 dorans rings
- Deathcap
- Armguard -&gt; Soc boots -&gt; Hourglass
- Lichbane 
- Void Staff
- Your choice of defensive or offensive item 

Play style:

I personally like to play passive early until I get wards. You can still harass with Stacked Deck[E] with Blue pick a card[W]. I say use blue pick a card because you do not want to get behind with your mana because level 6 ganks cost 250 mana ~ 50% of your mana pool [Ult

Try to gank every time your ult is up. Push lane then gank. Try to tele in by your team

Team fights:

In team fights you do one of two things. 
1.First either stun someone out of position
2.CC the enemy front line and poke with Q and autos from E. 

The reason you want to do these two things is because TF is going to be squishy no matter what. If you get too aggressive and move to close to the fight you are going to be blown up

If you have any questions let me know

1360958030.0,18lic9,My best game (and most fun) and why you should never quit.,praprapro,55,15,36,"I had a game yesterday in Silver III where my team went down ~2-12 in kills at around the 14-15 minute mark. I was playing Karthus mid and morale was low. The usual banter of blame was being thrown around from bot lane to top lane to jungler (and even some gloating from the opposing team). At this point we had a few options:


1) Quit and feed

2) Try to survive.

At this point I told my team we can win, who was gloating and talking trash towards us early in the match, were flipped in reverse at their own teammates for ""throwing"".

1359959870.0,17uskf,A call to arams: Why playing different game modes can give you a better understanding of Summoner's rift.,fomorian,56,13,25,"When newer players talk about the game, and the pressure put on you in the knowledge that any one teamfight can turn a game swiftly on its head

This is partially due to the structure or Summoner's rift. Every single SR game starts with the laning phase, get caught, and the game will be over before any real fight occurs. This can lead to people having good experience with laning phase, but not so good experience with teamfighting. 

The best way to alleviate this uncertainty is with familiarity, get to practice doing the perfect combo, and if you happen to pick the wrong target for your combo you'll have the chance to fix that mistake in the next teamfight. 

Another thing it helps you with is learning how to play as part of different team comps. ARAM and dominion team comps are radically different from SR comps, and judge what needs to be done in numerous different situations, rather than always having the cookie cutter answer of ""focus the carries.""

Apart from helping you learn how to teamfight, and what's stopping them from being the dominant strategy on SR? You get increased mana regen based on missing mana on the crystal scar. Manaless champions are therefore nerfed as a result of not benefiting from this. On ARAM, you aren't allowed to go back to heal, making health and mana regen items a lot stronger than on SR. These little changes force you to ask questions and get a deeper knowledge of the game as whole. 

Just one thing though: Never write off a ""bad"" aram team comp at champion select. First of all, but if they're plat level players or hotshot smurfs they could still make it work. Make no assumptions before the game, and just observe the game with an open mind.

Hey

I was about to list myself in the teacher list and it is insanely daunting to even start to attempt. I was curious if there is a way to create a new list that includes different (more precise) criteria for organization.

It's awesome that we have so many willing to help, etc? There is something missing.

So

* Find out if there is a way to list the current online status of teachers somehow. (I know this is possible with bots

* Define the trainers by the Elo/skill level they are willing to teach. IE: Why would a 2k waste their time teaching a 400 Elo player? I mean

* I really like the idea of a rating system, stressing honesty and asking questions like

Do you feel all of your time was used efficiently? Do you feel more confident in your play now

* I think general knowledge shouldn't exist as a category for training. Training should consist of 2 roles for a teacher, Mid, Jungle, Off Meta. Reason for no separation between support and carry? It can be just as beneficial in the duo lane to learn from the person you depend on, what they expect. This is Game Training.

* Another category that I feel should exist is General Training, someone else might know how all the damage ratios work and what champions pair up with what playstyles etc. This is a lot different than teaching someone the basics of a champion and how to lane sustain / last hit. Different metas exist, etc. There is a lot of stuff that doesn't fall under what most training should entail.

* Hours available should be layman. We already know what server people play on. If I play on NA

* Country doesn't matter

* Status is interesting - but if someone can't handle taking on new prospects then take them off the list IMO.

1340632584.0,vkl2j,5k Summoners celebratory Cliff Notes: How to ward bot lane like a man!,,50,10,11,"PEOPLE WHO SAY SUPPORT IS FOR GIRLS NEVER PLAYED LULU

Okay. ~~Arguably~~ Axiomatically the manliest facet of supporting is WARDING! First off, but also because it involves looking where you shouldn't and checking out the bot-lane bitchezzzzz like Ashe, Sivir and Tristana (IDGAF). Also lets you gain the upper hand on other alpha males trying to pee all over your territory by seeing them and peeing right back. Even better, when you get Red Wards (everybody says pink but they're red LIKE BLOOD) you can eliminate enemy wards with your manly hammer/bananas/fairy shit.  And don't even get me started on the ELIXIR OF MANLINESS (which I'll actually get on to later).

So, so you gotta micromanage yo! So, hand-pick your wards and set out for war. Gonna go over 9 good ward spots on the bottom side of the map, and why they're good. Pay close attention. Oh, and summoner? Come back with your shield, or on it!

[MANLY REFERENCE IMAGE](http://imgur.com/a/5rTv2)

1. Okay, why here? Well, if your mid laner isn't man enough to put the ward himself, go ahead and do it! Because this ward gives you full vision of their jungler's transit between wraiths and red, as well as vision of wraiths if your AP mid decides to suddenly sprout balls (CASSIOPEIA BAD IMAGERY) and steal wraiths, and also if they're coming from red side into river to gank mid or strut their stuff in the water. W/E, good ward spot. Also helps to stick one in your own wraiths if the enemy has it constantly warded

2. Okay, and if they have a man like Lee Sin who'd really like that red. Ward up your red and collapse on him when he goes for the steal. In the opposite situation, well. The #1 ward is infinitely better, but I suppose you could ward their red if you reeeeeeeally wanted to. 

3. Okay, or the same for red if you're on blue, but all in all its kinda overshadowed, by the glorious #1 ward. 

4. TRIBUSH! The tribush represents the three prongs of manliness: chest hair, Lee (after 6) or Hecarim (LOL shit) then you can really get fucked up. Also, red team's jungler probably won't be able to resist the temptation of getting behind your manly support arse, so this should counteract most ganks (lane &amp; river still a possibility though so don't get cocky, kid). Ward #6 can also help with that, but we'll get onto that later. 

5. PURPLE TEAM BLUE BUFF. Blue buff is so freakin' OP, a counter-ward can be of endless help in this situation, particularly if you have blue-reliant champions like Lee Sin, Anivia, Mordekaiser and Swain. You wanna make sure you get that blue, so don't give them the vision they need to steal the buff. If you know blue team warded it, just get a BLOOD WARD and kill that shit with your manly hands.

6. THAT ENTRANCE TO BLUE BUFF THERE THAT ALSO COVERS DRAGON. Such a manly ward, too. This ward covers three things, all of which are important to both teams. The entrance to blue buff (defensive if on purple team, offensive if on blue), the entrance to dragon (necessity) and the river between mid lane and bot lane (UMAD ROAMING MID LANES???). Now what does this do? It sets up for manly blue steals, and stops over-confident enemy junglers from stealing yours. It also gives you view of the fuckin' Balrog, which can allow you to properly contest it if the other team makes a play. Finally, if the mid-laner on the opposite team is someone who roams exceptionally well like Ahri

7. River brush ward. Kinda meh as it only reveals one thing (the river brush)

8 and 9. Same shit, what brush you put it in depends on your position. If the lane has been frozen in the middle, you want to probably put it in the enemy brush as that's likely where they'll stay. However, if they're pushing hard don't skimp, and dump one in your lane brush. This kind of ward is really effective against those supports that are gonna go for testosterone-fuelled kills like Leona (dyke so pretty manly), Blitzcrank (manly robot like Arnie) and Ali (COWMAN). In turn, if you're one of these supports

OKAY, its good when you know the enemy's got wards coming out their arse, and you wanna kill them all. Also good when you know you can GTFO after you killed dat ward. Also, weigh up the chance of dying with the potential reward. Often ain't a bad idea to have your jungler come around with you if you're sweeping whilst the enemy jungler is around just to avoid a Charlie Foxtrot. Also, its worth roaming around a bit once you got your elixir and clearing out wards in the 'AFK FARM SUX' zone, providing your carry is manly enough to stay alive whilst you're out strutting your hairy self around.

Think that's it. Probably got some more support guides coming up, big congrats to this awesome community for finally becoming 5k strong.

If you guys have any champion specific questions about playstyle/matchups/builds/runes I would love to hear them since those are the most fun for me to answer. Feel free to ask whatever you want though.

I'll be playing most of the day and answering questions between games.

**edit: Putting this here for visibility. I feel like its the most important thing in this thread.**

&gt;Play ranked 5s! I really dislike how focused the LoL community is on solo queue when the game is clearly designed to be played as a team. If I could get Riot to make one change to all of LoL I would have them add some kind of incentive to play 5's other than the LCS qualifier spots which only matter to .1% of the player base.

&gt;Really though

&gt;If there was one thing I could have people take away from this thread its to start playing 5's. I dream of a day when people use their 5s team rating as the standard for skill and everyone treats solo queue as just practice.

&gt;Finally

edit2: Done playing for now. Thanks for all the questions and I hope the answers were helpful. I'll probably do more sometime later this week. PLAYED RANKED 5's :)

1369773874.0,1f80so,"Climbed from Bronze V to Silver, just won my promotion today. Here is my story and some tips.",exeneva,57,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1f80so/climbed_from_bronze_v_to_silver_just_won_my/

I used to think that Bronze V was something you could not get out of, is the key to doing well in this league.

So here's how it happened. I quit league for about 2 years, then dropped after a massive loss streak into Bronze V. I started winning more in Bronze V, but my win/loss ratio after getting in (not before) was around 50%. I've taken statistics, and this is alarming because this means I legitimately belonged in Bronze V. After realizing this, I decided maybe I'm not as good of a player as I thought I was. 

I started watching the lecture series you see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ywhB-2h2AE
To this day, then E + BorK + ignite and you kill just about anyone. 

Assassins got me through Bronze V. I remember winning three 4v5s in that league

Bronze IV isn't much different from Bronze V, grabbing baron if we see someone on the other team bot, grouping mid and pushing after laning phase is over instead of just clearing lanes for 10 mins, etc. It's hard to take charge if you're going solo, but with a duo queue partner you can usually rally the rest of the team to win, despite the fact that most of them just want to do their 'bronze' things (like clear lanes/jungle for 10 mins).

In Bronze III I decided to focus more on my adc skills. I rewatched the first UNSW lecture and learned how to freeze the lane in the 'sweet spot'. In particular, I had almost a 50 cs lead on their Vayne, and I was the only person in the game with over 100 cs at that time. In fact, their Vayne was totally fucked just because I locked the lane - she tried roaming mid, but our wards shut that down. She tried to jungle, but 2 golems isn't enough to catch up to my minion farm. Their bot lane literally had nothing to do for a good 5 mins, it was beautiful.
We won that game later

Bronze III is where I realized most games are carry-able

Bronze II is when I started getting the occasional silver player on my team. I played mostly jungle through Bronze II, 3.) good CC. I said earlier I know how statistics work, and Sejuani has the highest winrate across all tiers in NA as a jungler (even higher than hecarim and amumu). Granted, hecarim is played more often, but sejuani seemed like the perfect 'secret op' jungler. I really fell in love with jungle in Bronze II, because I realized that if a lane was losing I could get them going again. Sejuani is tanky as fuck and I started having real success with her when I started doing more all-ins and dives to make sure lanes were guaranteed to get kills.

Bronze I is where I hit a plateau for about a week. I lost several games after getting to Bronze I, watched some streams, and then jumped back into league. The result was a 9-game winstreak that put me all the way up to the top of Bronze I. I lost a game or two after that, then got on hotstreak again to make series.

Series was rough because I had some silvers that are worse than some of the bronze players I saw in bronze V. In one of my series games, probably not even low silver level. It's a good feeling knowing that you are going to dominate in whatever lane you take, so you only have to worry about the other two lanes either being equal or feeding.

My series went like this: Loss - Win -Loss - Win - Win

I may be offering some coaching in the near future to anyone else who wants to make the climb. Here are some tips I found that made ridiculous amounts of difference:

-Freezing lane. There is a sweet spot in every lane, so make sure to tell your team to be careful or have a ward. In mid lane, this is less effective, but for top and bot it does wonders.

-Assassins like Diana, and Akali are especially strong in Bronze. I am actually not a good Diana player, but I have had games where I go 0/2 in lane and end up getting fed later on due to teamfight positioning and good focus. I have a little saying, ""in bronze, assassins will just get kills, regardless if they feed early on.""

-If playing jungler, then I see the enemy mid start pushing, so I ping like crazy (leaving wraiths) and go straight to mid and get my mid a kill. This is another tip - don't be locked into the notion that you have to finish your creeps. Gank on opportunity, you can finish wraiths/golems when you come back.

MOST IMPORTANT TIP OF ALL: If your team is willing to cooperate with you (and a lot of solo queue teams will not), 3.) Kill someone on the other team out of position, OMG GO PUSH NOW. You can exploit this pattern. After laning phase, group mid and push hard. The other team will be too busy clearing lanes top/bot or jungling to save outer/inner mid in time. At all moments of the game, there is going to be one team on OFFENSE and one team on DEFENSE. Defense = clearing lanes/jungle, offense = pushing towers, taking objectives (dragon, but also know when you need to be on defense.

1361393284.0,18wovh,Tips on Solo Queue and bettering yourself.,YourBFFLux,52,12,18,"http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/23416074
I've been hovering around Gold elo for a long time

In two days I went from Gold V to Gold I Day after that I hit Platinum V and day after that I went to Platinum IV

I believe a big part of bettering yourself in League of Legends is having the proper mentality.  In my opinion if you want to rise in elo you try to learn a few champions. I've played Ahri, and a bunch of other champions long enough that I can often just first pick them and not be afraid of a counter pick. Matchup knowledge is much better than just getting a counterpick. I've played Ahri vs Ryze and I think its a mistake that Ryze is a counter. Because if you play your champions strengths you'll still have chances to be succesful. 

For example: Ahri can push the wave much faster

The point if that is every champion has strengths and weaknesses, so don't dread on what they're doing to you - you need to focus on what you can do to them, or their team.

Top laners for example

Learning matchups is easier with champions that you love

For Solo Queue I think it's incredibly important to learn one - two champions per role

Myself I learned: Top: Riven/Shen/Akali/Nidalee/Rumble Mid: Ahri/Lux/Kat Bot: Caitlyn/Alistar/Lulu/Miss Fortune

Playing these champions over and over helped me win in Solo Queue

Always buy at least one ward when you back, just buy one, it won't ruin your build and put you far behind.

Mid laners this is most important for you since ganks can make or break your lane. Try to ward enemy wraith camp to prevent roaming mids

Don't rage

Baron is the #1 throw in Solo Queue. Don't do it if there's a chance they can steal it or ace your team. This is a big comeback for the team you just pulled ahead of and will give them the momentum to turn the close game around.

Objectives! They are up all the time, buffs, dragon, turrets, push waves. Just do something after your team secures a kill. 

Communication is almost as important as your individual skill. Tell your team what do to, or back without losing exp.

Losing streaks. These are such discouraging things when it comes to Solo Queue. After a loss, get a drink, anything. Just kill some time and let it reset.

Don't lose a game at champion select. Complaining about bad bans, but good for pressuring the map. So pick other champions that can do so. 

Last hitting, let the turret hit, then auto again. It's a little hard at first but you will get used to it.  A possible of 130 minions are last hittable before 10 minutes. I think. Roughly. So try to aim for 85-100, that is good. You aren't doublelift so don't get frustrated when you miss one, or two in a row. Try and count the CS you miss in lane not the ones you get. The game does that for you. Next game try and lower that number. Whatever you do don't suicide for creeps. Countless times I've seen an ADC be 1v2 bottom because the support backed or warded, and they'd go to last hit only to get engaged on and die. Pay attention to your lane partner. Think about a few things, can you get to the turret safely?  Your life isn't worth 18-40 gold.  So just stay in exp range if possible and don't fall behind in levels.

1359167077.0,17am39,Hi I have been teaching League of Legends for about 2 years now and reached the highest bracket in ranked both seasons 1 and 2 as a support main (And im probably not mechanically superior to most of you)   [AMAA],LedogodeL,57,19,127,"I moved recently and i havent been able to play league in about a month and i dont think i will be coming back to this game as a player again. I have been recently contacted as becoming a coach for a team but its not set in stone and i wont be fielding any questions about it. I still enjoy watching this game and before i leave this subreddit for a good long while i thought it would be a decent time to leave behind things i have learned both teaching and playing this game.

I promised a few people that i would write a guide to how to improve your own play... but seeing how every time i sit down to write it i always get distracted. (Once by my thesis... which shows you how bad the situation is) I still hope to finish that and hopefully this AMA will give me the feedback required to finish it.

A few things about my history with this game and teaching:

* I was absolutely awful at this game when i started. Lucky i had friends who were very good at this game and by playing against them and watching how they beat me i was able to make myself serviceable at this game.
* I am very picky about choosing full time students. But over 2 years out of the 5 i have chosen all have made at least a 400 elo jump with one making an almost 1k jump in elo from 800 to 1750 last season. 2 of which ending up in last seasons diamond bracket.

* I think mindset and self confidence are the two most important things when it comes to learning. And i am of the strong opinion that Elo hell does not exist and after 100 ranked games you are within 100 Elo of your skill level.

* I used to run a few things having to do with summonerschool that i no longer have the time to run. If you are interesting in being a teacher in summonerschool i can help you set some things up. Like how to run inhouses etc.

Over the past year this community has changed a lot. More people isnt always a good thing but good with the bad. In the end the goal of this community is admirable and i hope as i check back in over the coming months it continues to grow.

I am still willing to teach as my laptop has the ability to spectate games just fine. I am more than willing to do team coaching over the next two days and individual coaching via spectating as well.

Things i will be more willing to answer:

* Given your situation how to improve your own gameplay.

* General ways to teach yourself

* What to look for in a mentor/student

* Things i think would be good for this community and why

* Meta changes over the past years

* Questions about supports/anylane (Minus items)

* General non personal things about myself (aka nothing i have to give you a proper noun to answer)

What i wont answer:

* Opinions on specific people in the community

* Item builds (things are so game dependent and its something you should learn for yourself)

* Why your teammates always suck(ps they dont)

I will also be on mumble for the next two days most likely in pug 13 if you want to discuss the game, or just want to talk about anything (kittens preferred). I will also be up tonight watching the eu games if you want to discuss those.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,default,

*Create Specific Champion Guides* This includes Masteries/Runes/Skilling order/ Item build / Play styles / and some useful tips and tricks for that champion. I intend to do this for every top lane champion.

*Tips and Tricks* In general

*Commentaries* of full length gameplays

Ok so I've roughly played about 1k games. Sitting at Bronze II currently and I'll probably make it to Bronze I tonight. You might be thinking ""HAH

Well, etc. So I stopped playing ranked. Grinded out a few hundred more normals to improve my mechanics, gameplay knowledge and just too boost my confidence a bit.

After about 4 months of not playing ranked I went back in. I had one goal in mind. Get too Gold before the season ended. I considered myself a much better player then I was back then so I thought I would easily make it. But after all that practice

So season 2 ended. And I was still at 900. After the season ended I told myself I was done with ranked. It was stressing me out way too much. And then I realised. Why the fuck am I getting so pissed off about it? In reality, it would not actually affect my life at all. So I went into ranked once more in pre-seaon 3. 5 of my 15 placement matches I got afk/trolls. I lost another 5. And so there I was, back at 900 elo! It didn't really bother me this time though. Everyone gets trolls in there game and I just happened to be unlucky. Shit happens. But that doesn't mean I didnt stay away from ranked for a while. So after a few weeks of justt casual playing, I thought maybe I was setting the bar too high for myself?

It's great to have goals in mind. But there is such a thing as setting them too high to achieve in the near future. Sure,000. But think about it. I could be wrong, but I think there are about 16 million active monthly LoL players. At the season 2 world championship there were 60 active players in this tournament. Just think about that. 16 MILLION active players. And 60, make it too the World Championship. 

You have to be realistic with your Goals. I didn't start improving until I started setting lower goals for myself. When these leagues came around I was in Bronze V. I decided, this was it. I could finally complete a goal I had set in League. Too my luck, the enemy team got an afk in 2 matches in a row. Next game was a steam roll. There I was Bronze IV! Finally, I had reached a goal. And you know what? It felt damn good. I know that's kinda stupid because it's only Bronze IV, but dammit I finally achieved something! So from then on, I don't set long term goals in this game. I feel it just puts far too much pressure on yourself. And now we fast forward a few months and here I am, nearly at Bronze I and every promotion has felt just as good.

 Now, weren't really rising up the ladder and just kinda let it get too you, stop letting it get too you. Doesn't help you. Hell take a break from ranked for a while. Start playing normals with some friends for some fun. And if you don't have any friends to play with just pm me. I'm always up for some normal shenanigans.


So to kind of wrap things up, mechanics etc. Also don't be so caught up in losing. Think of Newtons third law of motion ""Law III: To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction..."" For every persons win/achieved goal/w.e someone has to fail their goal/lose. It's just how it works. So getting all worked up about it doesn't help you one bit. It just puts more stress on you.

tl:dr just read it if you want help. It's healthy to read.

So this is something that I see a lot from lower league players. They say they win their lane and get snowballed the majority of the time

Let's take an example. You're top. You get first blood with your jungler early

Now, they're worth ~120g. 4 deaths and that's ~70g. At this point, killing them instead of cs'ing actually loses you gold if you miss 3+ cs.

Taking the 10 min example above. All other lanes are even

This is what I feel is happening in these games where they dominate top yet still lose. They've won top

Start again at the 10 min example. Instead of farming the enemy top, push out top then go kill 1 at bot and take dragon. You're either fighting 4v5 with top trying to farm back in to the game, or 5v5 and they're top is weak and not getting any farm at all.

In the second example, they'll just sit in lane and farm for 20-25 mins and not actually use that advantage for anything.

Stop thinking about ""winning your lane"" or ""needing to farm"" or whatever. If you're ahead

So here's some tips to kill the little badger.

* Don't let Teemo just push you to your tower

* Don't try to fight Teemo early on if you're melee, it's not worth it, ever, it's only going to waste the potions you should be using to get all the CS you can while getting poked, teemo will always be safe in a 1v1 vs most top laners.

* Itemize and mastery wise against Teemo

* Make sure to take the Mastery ""Unyielding"" this blocks all champion damage by 2, Darius who all have DoTs (Damage over time) so for example Teemo's Level 1 Poison will tick 6 damage per second for 4 seconds, now that's 24 magic damage but every tick is -2 damage so that means instead of 24 magic damage you're taking 16 damage, now that's 8 damage less, it may not sound a lot but worth while this will negate a lot of damage and will add up with your resistance later on.

* Lastly don't be afraid to ask for your jungler to force his lane down

Passive: Double Strike: Every 4 attacks, because there's something they don't tell you: You need to string all of those attacks together, or you lose your stacks of Double Strike. Each attack must be made within about 3 seconds of each other, or else you have to start over. Which makes sense in terms of Yi's character, it makes sense he'd be double striking in combat, but when running around he'd lose the focus he needs to double tap. It should be noted that Double Strike procs all on-attack effects as the old one did-keep this in mind.

Q: Alpha Strike. Works almost exactly like before, but it is compensated by reducing the cooldown of Alpha Strike by one second with each basic attack (I could not tell if Double Strike reduced it by 2. I suspect not). 

W: Meditate: Of all Yi's abilities, but the damage reduction is nowhere near the old meditate's reduction, and the healing is a lot less. Yi heals more with Meditate the less health he has, so this is primarily meant to be used when outside combat (or when everyone is DEAD). It's still very useful, and contributes a lot to Yi's jungling potiential while also giving him some sustain if he's forced into lane. It also still works for reducing damage, if needed-just don't do it if more then one guy is attacking.

E: Wuju Style: Passive-Yi gains a bonus to Attack Damage equal to a percentage of his total AD. Active: Yi deals True Damage for 6 seconds

OH MY GOD THIS IS AWESOME. This is awesome for taking on dragon and baron, Yi can take on Tanks and WIN. 

Ultimate: Highlander: Passive: The cooldown of Yi's basic abilities is reduced by 18 seconds every time he scores a kill (half for assists). Active: Boost to Move Speed

Highlander is just as awesome as it once was, you can still Alpha Strike until the enemy is dead. And you can still chain Highlander kills like no tomorrow.

All in all, but Yi can not only stomp a lane but can dominate the jungle with ease. Good luck out there on the Rift, summoners, and enjoy the New Yi!",Master Yi,False,self,False,t3_1jgy1u

&gt;I tend to do both in solo Q depending on what I'm feeling at the time.

* Support runes are HP quints

* Supports go Ruby Sightstone, I guess supports should be building more items? But doesn't that mean less vision...?

**Ahri**: try to use your ultimate offensively rather than defensively; also

**Corki**: Smartcast your ultimate. In general, your Q reveals units that get hit by it, so don't facecheck dem bushes. Lastly, his passive takes the raw damage you would deal (including crits and sheen procs), before armor reduction, so it scales extremely well; Grab one point in W very early, and max it last. It is used as an escape, as the cast animation is very clumsy (thanks buffofspades :)

**Graves**: Don't be afraid to get in people's faces especially if your passive is stacked. Graves is a man

**Maokai**: Oftentimes, instead in order to get both ticks, especially if they are in their minion line.

**Nunu**: Try to predict where the enemy will go

**Rammus**: Ok. conversely, build HoG/Philo and defensive items. Don't fall for his passive, build maybe one armor item and one MR item, but don't forget health. His W gives a ton of survivability. Get a level of W first to jungle, and pick up Q and E before trying a gank. Max E for maximum enemy disruption. Use your ult liberally, it has a relatively short cooldown and hurts towers/inhibs. Be warned though, any fast jungler will easily be able to counter-jungle you and you won't really be able to do anything about it. You need good ward coverage in the river and to coordinate with your allies to collapse on invading enemy junglers.""

**Ryze**: smartcast everything

1372104557.0,1gzngn,How to carry your games as a mid laner in lower ELO.,_nu,45,5,37,"I've seen this question asked a million times. The majority of people in Bronze consider themselves better than everyone else because they can generally win their lane but can't win the game. So people always ask: how do I carry the game? what champs are good to carry with? After a few bad placement matches I went from Bronze 4-&gt;Silver in 5 days with a 65-70% win rate mostly playing mid. Take all this advice with a grain of salt since I'm not Platinum or Diamond

**How To Get Ahead In Lane As A Mid Laner**

**Farm** 

This is one of the most important ways to get ahead in lower ELOs. Almost no one properly farms at that stage because no one thinks it's that important. Let's take mid for example. Generally you will have an opponent who thinks it is his job to try to kill you early and will focus on harassing you. All you need to do is start off with a ward or two and farm the minion waves as they come. Obviously if you can get a clear kill get it, farm. When your jungler is out helping other lanes pick up your wraiths/wolves. When you see the enemy jungler far away enough pick up his wraiths/wolves. Push the creep wave, grab the wraiths, keep going. If you can outfarm your opponent this way you could have no kills 15 minutes in but you will have so much more gold that once you start being able to clear waves instantly and harass him he will not stand a chance. You will normally be 1-2 levels higher than everyone else in the game and can just get a kill mid -&gt; roam -&gt; farm -&gt; repeat. If you learn how to farm like a Gold+ player in a Bronze game I guarantee your win rate will go up. 

Side note

**Learn Your Enemy's Abilities**

Going up against a champ that you are unfamiliar with? Take the few minutes while the game is loading just to briefly read up on the champ's abilities and cooldowns. This will help you tremendously. I remember going up against a Malzahar (a champ I don't normally see) and getting crushed because I had no idea what he could do. Any time you are facing a champ that you don't at least know what each of their abilities can do make sure to read up on them so you can counter at the right times and stay far away at other times (for example: never tower dive Zed when his ult is up; don't stand near Akali's invisible bubble when you are marked with her Q).

**Capitalize On Your Opponent's Mistakes**

This only applies when you are very knowledgeable about your opponent's champ. If you know the enemy's champion well enough that you have his/her cooldowns memorized, and Q-R him while and get in a few AA's because I know that he can't just W out of it and then harass me safely. Or if I'm Fizz against Kassadin and see that he just ulted towards me and used his E/Q, I'll hit him with my E/Q/W to land a lot of damage when I know he can't silence me or get away. Continue like this and you will eventually come out on top in trades.

**Call Your Jungler**

You have a jungler for a reason. He can very easily turn a losing lane into a winning lane if you call him at the right time. Check to see if your opponent bought a ward and take note of where they place it. If you see that he is overextended (more towards your side of the map than his) with no vision

**Ward**

The golden advice every player will tell you. It is not the support's/jungler's job to ward, pick one up and place it there. I have been in quite a few games thrown because there was no ward at baron. Many people will rage at the support for not putting one there but that is not the case. You should have seen that there was no ward and YOU should have put on there.

**Call MIAs**

The other mid laner is also looking to roam around and kill of side lanes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now That You Are Ahead

**Roam**

This is very, you will definitely still lose. As your job as a high burst champion you are responsible for roaming during the laning phase. You can do this at all times, but I generally recommend at least having your ultimate as it tends to do the highest amount of damage on mid laners. If your opponent backs, push the lane up to turret, and now you have 30 seconds to roam. Look at the top and bottom lanes to see if either of these lanes can be ganked. If either of the opposing champions are overextended? Gank. Is the opposing champion(s) low enough that you can 1 shot them safely? Gank. Are they pushing tower while your bottom/top lane are at base? Come in and force them off of the tower, while also picking up some nice exp/gold. I am generally out of lane more than I am in lane after 10 minutes in. The more you are around the map (while still getting all the exp/gold you can mid lane) the better. This will help your other lanes win their lane and you will have a much stronger late game and therefore a much better chance at winning.

**Team Fighting**

Team fights are what win and lose games, your job is to destroy the most valuable target. This most valuable target is almost always the ADC: the glass cannon of the enemy team. Unless they are extremely far behind they can stand in the back and poke at your team all day, so you need to get to the ADC, kill him instantly, and get the hell out before you are focused. Once the ADC or most valuable target (usually the most farmed target) is gone do what you can without dying. For the rest of the team fight just hit the enemy with what you can and try to pick off any low health targets.

**Be A Leader and Communicate**

You are better than the other Bronze players right? Well your team won't know this if you stay quiet. You guys just won a team fight? Awesome

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is by no means the best way to play Mid, how to get out of Bronze and how to win Bronze games. Follow everything in this guide and you won't have to worry about winning your lane and losing the game, because you just won your lane, your bot lane, your top lane, and the game.

1372074877.0,1gypb4,Champion power spikes in early game and item transitions,Fridgecake,47,10,84,"Hi /r/Summonerschool

I'm writing an article on champion power spikes and i'd like your help as i'm not familiar with the power of all the champions. I'm specifically trying to look at when a champion will be strong in both their leveling and their item builds.

I realise a lot of this article is ""once champion X gets Y ability and Z item"" because that is when they gain actual power. But i'd like to try and make it a little specific for ceratin champions and when they might be likely to kill you or end up stronger than you are.

I realise this is an opinion based article as i'm not going to do the DPS maths behind every character but it might be useful for people to see when they should be fighting with their characters and when they should be wary of other characters.

Examples:

**Riven, 6.** Riven is a potent duelist with just 2 of her abilities and one of the strongest with all 3 abilities. Her ult is very dangerous and she will be looking to all-in you around level 6.

Riven gains a lot power from Bloodthirster and when she starts to amass some cooldown reduction.

**Jayce, 3.** Early game on Jayce isn't that strong due to mana constraints but he can put out a lot of damage in a burst combo. Jayce doesn't gain that large of a power spike at level 6 like most champions do, abuse this!

Jayce becomes very strong in lane once he has his Tear stacked enough that mana stops becoming an issue and once again his Manamune is complete.

**Jarvan

J4 tends to play in the jungle but gains a power spike from any early damage items he builds in lane including Doran's Blades.

**Ryze

He starts to really ramp up in power once he gets a few items such as a fully stacked Tear or Rod of Ages.

I've got a few more champions that I have mapped out myself

Any suggestions that I use in the article will be creditted.

Thanks

**Edit:** I had a suggestion as to whether we could add a 'power rating' or something similar. If you'd like to include that then i'll try and add it into the article but if not try and add some explanation as to why you have the power spike.

So for example


**Examples from posters**

**Rumble, he hits another powerspike at level 6 with his ultimate.

**Vladimir 6 and 9.** As most champions, he becomes a real threat and unmovable pushing object

**Fizz, and 6.** Fizz can trade really well at level 2 and easily get a kill with W and Q, even easier at 3 because he can use e to dive or escape. At level 6 the shark is a big spike of damage.

Lich bane is a huge source of damage because his Q applies on hit damage which works with W and lich bane.

**Cassiopeia, 9.** Without both her E and one of her poisons, Cassiopeia is rather weak. But once she gets both, she has the highest damage per second for AP casters. Avoid long fights. If Cassiopeia maxes her E at level 9, everyone should beware.

**Poppy, 6.** Poppy's power spike occurs whenever she picks up both her Q and E. Beware of walls after she does, because at any point in the game, getting charged into a wall will halve most target's HP. At level 6, beware of tower dives and Poppy charging in on multiple people with her ultimate on. (Also watch for her to grab Sheen, huge power spike whenever that happens.)

**Edit 2:** This seems to have taken off a bit. We're currently at 27 champions

**Edit 3!** Up to 44 Champions at the moment. Any more we can Add?

Hey r/SummonerSchool! INA Aurelius here again with another guide for you all! Just trying to help out the general LoL community, i.e. DMG output, champion familiarity, game phases, objectives, etc., and to help the newbies out to the gaming scene. 

As you may remember me from my last guide, I'll be writing about How to play Mid Lane. 

 * If you haven't seen my last guide, here is the link below:

http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/19e9tj/what_we_learn_from_recommended_champions/

To **clarify** on the point of this guide:

I'm writing it to help out anyone new to playing Mid Lane, and even people who main with a champion in Mid Lane and just wishes to get better at it. I hope you all enjoy this guide, as much as I do writing it, so I may, to the best of my knowledge, to explain what and what not to-do when playing Mid Lane.

**Mid Lane - The Basic Fundamentals**

 * **Your Role in the Team Composition** - Depending on whether you're playing as an AD mid laner or, your essential role 
in a 5v5 team composition is to be a primary source of whatever DMG you scale off of

 * **Mid Laner's Positioning in Teamfights** - Although highly dependent on the situation and which champion you're playing, will want to stay within the back of the lines and use abilities to their fullest effect while kiting and staying out of the ""heart"" of the battle, i.e. where all the Bruisers, Tanks, and ""dive"" Assassins are. Remember that you offer the 2nd largest DMG output on your team, if things are about even, so surviving long enough to live up to that role is important.  

 * **Responsibilities as the Mid Laner** - This includes a wide variety of things such as:

 * Keeping up with what your enemy Mid Laner is doing, went close to a bush to place a ward, etc.

 * Knowing where he/she is as well is just as important. Call MIAs often AND remember to Ping so that your allies are informed with it, 1 or 2 pings are enough. There's nothing more aggravating than someone who enjoys spamming pings. 

 * Your AND the enemy blue buff timers, e.g. if you know the enemy's blue spawn time and your Jungler goes out to steal the enemy's while you defend yours. 

 * Not only do you have the responsibility of keeping track of the enemy Mid Laner but as well as the enemy Jungler, be appearing in the Mid Lane to either cover the lane for his Mid Laner, or to gank you. Always note the position in which the enemy Jungler leaves and enters, and notify your teammates, e.g. ""Warning Ping"" type in chat ""Xin was Mid.""

 * Keeping up with your enemy Mid Laner's Summoner Spells and as well as Abilities

 * **What Champions can be played in Mid Lane**

When you ask what champions can be played in mid lane, there are some champions that just don't belong in Mid Lane, e.g. Leona or Rammus mid?, so one might ask, what champions do? Since there are A LOT of champions, I'll do and explain a general breakdown of the **types** of champions, to the best of my knowledge, if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one

 * *""All-In"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, Riven, Kayle, etc. This type of champion is very ""bursty"" in his/her combos, and generally have a kit aimed to allow him/her to make successful dives for you, when you're under your tower w/o much threat from tower-aggro, and get out unscathed thanks to either his/her resistances, or good escapes. The reasoning behind this is that Katarina has her E Shunpo to get out of ""sticky"" situations if she secures a kill, and with Kayle

 * *The ""Nukers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Malzahar, LeBlanc, Syndra, etc. This type of champion has some close similarities to the ""All-In"" Mid Laners in DMG output, but lack the kit to make ""safe"" tower dives. They generally rely on simply out-bursting you with his/her kit, much too fast for you to even respond to it. Although they generally have insane DMG output, due to their lack of resistances

 * *The ""Teamfighters""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Orianna, Zyra, etc. This type of champion is categorized for his/her amazing CC potential for teamfights. Although they may not be the best candidate for upfront 1v1s, they excel in their roles as an AP/AD Carry in teamfights thanks to his/her kit. They are also known for their zoning capabilities during laning phase, yet rarely dive an enemy underneath his/her tower for a kill, unless with the help of his/her jungler. 

 * *The ""Duelist""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Diana, Kayle, Zed, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her DPS potential and the general idea that he/she can take some punishment for a kill, i.e. tower diving, very aggressive zoning

 * *The ""Roamers""* - Some champions that fall into this category, Evelynn, Katarina, Nidalee, etc. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to push his/her lane extremely quickly and then leave to go gank other lanes. They are best known for their highly successful ganking potential, e.g Twisted Fate's Destiny&gt;Gold Card or Katarina's Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;R, that can help that particular lane ""snowball"" ahead the enemy laner. 

 * *The ""Secondary AD Carry""* - Some champions that fall into this category, you may still stumble upon this type of Mid Laner. This type of champion is categorized by his/her ability to ""bully"" the enemy laner with just AAs thanks to his/her range. 

 * *The ""Play for Late"" Mid Laners* - Some champions that fall into this category, Anivia, Mordekaiser, Cassiopeia, etc. This type of champion is categorized by the simply idea that they do not need kills to be successful, although not-dying is important as well, relying on just ""farming for late game"" holds true in this type of champion's strategy. They are generally item dependent on their DMG

 * *The ""Burst Assassins"" -  Some champions that fall into this category, Katarina, Kha'Zix, Zed, etc. and are categorized for his/her massive DMG burst potential, i.e. the ability to ""insta-gib"" an important enemy from 100 to 0, before he/she can respond, AND as well as get out of the fight before he/she dies

 * *The ""DPS AoE Assassins"" -  Some champions that fall into this category, Talon, Katarina, Evelynn, etc. and are categorized for his/her amazing DPS AoE DMG potential in teamfights that deal a bit less DMG than that of Burst Assassins but in a more AoE field than singular field. Although they are almost all the same champions that fit the category of the Burst Assassins, the difference is that of builds, i.e. Burst Assassins will go for single targets, while DPS AoE Assassins will build slighty more oriented to do DMG to the entire enemy team, Evelynn's Q

Those are the main categories,  if you guys think I messed up on a category or think I should add another one, let me know in the comments, you'll be helping me out and the rest of the community, thank you again.

**How does the Mid Lane laning phase differ from that of other lanes?**

The differences between Mid lane versus Top and/or Bot lane

 * The distance of the enemy and allied towers from one another

 * The distance of the towers behind the 1st tower, since the tower ranges overlap one another. 

 * Bushes are placed on either side of you making ""bush-ganks"" less common for you if you play safely away from them. 

 * You have access to both sides of both jungles, etc., which means that a little responsibility is put upon you when it comes to the jungle since you have access to either. 

 * You have access to both entrances to the river

 * You are a Solo lane, and more CS. 

 *  Your lane may be ganked more often than other lanes

 * You have the responsibility, of keeping and eye out for the following areas: Mid Lane mias, Purple and Blue side ramps to Wraiths, Side bushes, and (sometimes) enemy blue buff spawn times. 

**Ganking as a Mid Laner**

Ganking as a Mid Laner is sometimes risky, but may potentially snowball an enemy lane, so knowing when to gank as a Mid Laner is key. At least one of these criteria must be met (although not always) if you wish to go gank another lane: 
 
 * If you have pushed your lane to the enemy tower

 * If you've ""forced"" your enemy laner out of lane and back to Base. 

 * If you've been ganked by the enemy jungler and enemy mid laner and kill either one of them

 * If one of your teammates is forced to tower-hug AND the enemy laner of your teammate has no ward coverage as they overextend. 

 * If you have a large lead against the enemy mid laner and cannot be hurt much if you leave lane and miss CS and gold. 

 * Your enemy mid laner is missing or if you killed them and are ""healthy"" enough for a successful gank.  

*How-To Gank (tips)*

 * Ping that you are on your way

 * Ask if any brush/river is warded. 

 * Wait for the perfect opportunity is which you can guarantee a kill, read below)

 * Although, in which there will be a situation in which you can either guarantee a kill or save an ally's life **w/o** sacrificing yours, e.g. you saw the enemy Jungle walk through Mid Lane to go gank Top Lane, so you ""know"" something is going to happen soon. 

 * Learn to save your dashes/blinks/Flash/etc. for when the enemy uses his/her's. Most cases, or ""bad"" allied plays. 

 * Sometimes, how much HP the enemy laner has, the potential DMG output of the enemy laner, the location of th enemy jungler and mid laner. Remember, think before you do. ""Bad"" plays are generally made through poor decisions, which come from not thinking before he/she acts.

**The Importance of the Mid Lane tower**

 * The Mid lane towers are the most important among the ""Lane Towers

 * So having these down will definitely give you an advantage for if your creep wave is pushing into their base, e.g Dragon, Baron, Buffs, other towers, etc., for almost free. 

 * ALTHOUGH, i.e.  you need to save the tower so that you can receive creeps to far off of, cause if the enemy mid lane tower is gone, you might have to overextend to get any CS or gold, putting you in a very vulnerable position. Communicate with your teammates to ensure nobody is missing out before the first tower falls. 

**What should I start with when I go Mid Lane?**
 Your choices are:

 * *Boots &amp; 3x Pots* - This is may be a start for anyone who is up against any enemy champion that relies of skillshots for his/her DMG output, but that is entirely up to you, remember, that extra MS might help you catch someone out of position, catch someone when invading during early game, dodge more skillshots, or outrun your opponent if you get caught. 

 * *9x HP Pots &amp; 2 Green Sight Wards* - This is a start that is taken when you are aiming to simply out sustain your opponent, and levels. This is generally taken with champions that benefit from not having a mana Resource for his/her abilities, e.g. Katarina, Riven, Akali, etc., this does not have to limit the champions that do use mana for you can just simply trade in 4x HP Pots for 4x Mana Pots instead. Again

 * *Cloth Armor &amp; 5x HP Pots - Although this is more commonly taken for Top Lanes or was taken for junglers back in Season 2, and if you don't feel confident playing against this particular champion. and is also useful if you're an AP rushing a Seeker's Armguard against the AD heavy enemy team. 

 * *4x HP Pots &amp; 1x Fortitude Pot* - This is taken for only two reasons: One. You are planning to be excessively aggressive and are playing an AD champion, deny the enemy laner from farm, while healing up on any trade backs, if any. 

 * *Doran's Ring or Doran's Blade* - These starting item allows you to stay in lane for a very long time, harassing to deny CS from the enemy laner, staying behind your creep to avoid getting hit by skill shots, etc. An ok item to start with, if you only wish to farm and be passive, but does not offer the same bonuses as other starting items and vice-verse.

 * *Tome &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot or Sword &amp; 2x HP Pots* - A poor choice

 * *Crystalline Flask &amp; 1x HP/Mana Pot &amp; 1x Green Ward* - A very safe choice if you wish to either play safely and farm, in case of any ganks, etc.

 * *Fairy Charm &amp; 1x Green Ward &amp; 6x HP/Mana Pots* - To be taken if you wish to have a fair amount of Mana in your pool during trades, if you lack the ManaReg runes to help with your ManaReg, or you wish build against any AP enemy laner, e.g. it will build into Chalice. Offers a solid ground for building into other items and as well as a very large pool of ManaReg for out sustaining your enemy laner. May sometimes even out sustain those that start with 9x HP Pots &amp; 2x Green Wards if you have some SpellVamp.

**Masteries as the Mid Laner**

Depending on the specific champion you're playing in the Mid Lane and as well as your opponent

 * **21/9/0** - This is a set for those that wish to either be aggressive throughout the game w/o sacrificing too much squishy-ness on your part if you are playing against another Mid Laner who has the same DMG potential as you. Would be recommended for those Mid Laners who's abilities or AAs put him/her in a melee position and are against anyone with ranged abilities, Zed, etc., and do not need the 9 Points put into the Utility tree for added ManaReg or buff duration. 

 * **9/21/0** - This is a set either aimed at surviving what you determine will be a hard laning phase, or at least for the majority, beat out Offensive stats. This is most prevalent during early game, so keep that in mind during the Champion Select stage. 

 * **21/0/9** - This set is generally gear towards those Mid Laners that wish to dish out a large amount of DMG throughout the game and play aggressively with the help from the additional ManaReg and extended Blue Buff duration

 * **9/0/21** - This is a set in which is yet to be actually used widely throughout the game, I'm currently in the process of testing it out, but regardless, this is a set for those Mid Laners who have a **huge** spike in either DMG potential or Kill potential once they hit Lvl 6, and their enemy Laner has yet to hit Lvl 6. This applies to certain champions that also excel at Roaming the map for kills, e.g. Twisted Fate w/ 9/0/21 masteries will hit Lvl 6 significantly much more faster than the enemy allowing him to gank any lane and snowball it or himself, e.g. Katarina w/ 9/0/21 masteries will hit Lvl 6 and use her Lvl 6 ult advantage to kill the enemy or other enemies since the others will be under her lvl and have an ult disadvantage. The added +3% MS helps with roaming and ganking. SpellVamp &amp; LifeSteal are an added bonus for a very small amount of sustain. Again, I'm still trying these out

There are two kinds of gap closer: dash and blink. A dash is something that moves you quickly through a space- Graves E, Vayne q all count. There's also blinks- these are flash-type skills, rarer and better. Flash itself, Ezreal's thingy, Shaco's q- anything that puts you directly from one position to another, without mucking around in the middle.

The big difference between these is walls. With a dash

With a blink, perhaps inadvertently, with flash. It's important to know the range of any blinks you might have so you can know your maximum travelling distance. For the record, this works with wards as well- if you place them in the middle of a wall, they'll go to the nearest space that it's possible to ward, which is exactly how it works for blinks.

Additional differences: You can be hit in the middle of a dash by a skillshot or going through a trap such as Caitlyn's w or Veigar's e. If you blink through these,,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,True

1341295733.0,vytk4,[G] How to Improve Your Own Play Quickly,tankerton,51,11,18,"Hello SS. It has come to my attention some things that the average ""Summoner School"" player should have aren't even known about

What am I talking about? It's a fair question

Let's share a story of a young football player, a huge feat considering I could hardly bench 80 lbs before this ordeal of a year. My gains in strength were significant, adding nearly 70% to my previous strength rating where my peers adding ~15-30. Another year passed of the hard work ethic and I added another 40% gains of my strength, yes there are diminishing returns in the game of life. My peers, in general, added only~10%. By my senior year I was surpassing and caught up to some of the stronger players on the team. (My speed, however

My work ethic wouldn't have worked by playing a bunch of pick up football or simply playing for hours every day. It certainly would help and show me some of the things only experience gives a player in the game of football, and speed wouldn't improve without drilling in specific workouts to specific parts of my ""game"". This can be said about league as well.


In League

Everyone can use an item advantage. Everyone can improve their chances of getting an item to a determined science assuming they farm well. There is no question that around every 30 seconds after 1:30 there will be 6 or 7 minions to make gold with. Now it is up to the player to make 6 or 7 last hits. 

The first ten minutes of the game are crucial to farming. Not only will it be the only set aside time to farm, but you'll lose gold handed to you if you miss last hits. 

The process in doing this is simple. Go to a custom game with no bots/enemies, learn their base MS/AD, learn how long the particle takes to travel to the minion, etc. Do this over...and over...and over...until you can almost perfectly cs. This will take ages to do. But it will significantly help your farm when the in-game scenarios come, especially under stress.


Mechanics are a huge part to this game and if you have 100% strong mechanics you will win a large percentage of your games for...ever? I dont know. Executing what you want to happen is difficult in practice but will take time to get used to. Use this type of focused practice as much as you can with people or by yourself. Wanna practice blitz pulls? go to bot lane with a friend playing an enemy adc practicing farm and see what percentage of pulls you land. Want to see timings and health values for different jungle routes? run the first couple clears on your own in customs. Wanna learn ANY champion better before going into queue with intent to play them? Play them in a bot lane and get comfortable with their skills. It takes time

Second and much less obvious are the analysis of your decisions. 

League is a long game. Often you may not remember how first blood was scored unless you're the one who got it or how well top lane was farming by 50 minutes into a game stressing over a baron. You can analyze your choices in ""down time"" like going back to buy or by playing follow the leader or ""afk farming"", there is a certain heat of the moment that comes over you sometimes to go all in or run in fear which is often misguided. Three, you can be over or under confident in your information depending on how the game has gone to a certain point without analyzing all the correct information.



Therefore

There are tools to do so

http://www.leaguereplays.com/

It works simply in the background

As a Starcraft 2 player

I'd recommend everyone here to do the same, playstyle, or champion matchips. Its up to you to get that ""metagame"" information. 

When I watch a replay I always look for 3 good things, maybe you stop bad behavior, and maybe you're actively thinking of what you want to change in your plays next game. All of these coming together at once is what advances your play quickly, even only playing 2-3 games in a day. 

Finally

With these two formats of practice happening as a ""warm up"" and ""cool down"" to your league queueing experience, but you'll notice improvement immediately and improvement that sticks. You no longer push past river without wards lategame because you got caught in 5 games straight as different champs, and you didnt die because of that and that gold didnt go to the enemy team. All those advantages add up.

What I simply ask is to make League a routine much like any well trained athlete. You don't see professional football players play the game all day until their legs cannot hold them any longer. You see them rest, and ultimately always improve. 

There is no benchmark onto how much or little time you spend doing these things or reading into them. You take as much as you feel neeeded, and replay watching can improve you so much quicker than maybe queueing for that 3rd game would be. That I can promise you, assuming you put in the time and effort.

I'm a Gold IV Jungle and Support who teaches personal development and counsels RL. I play games between bronze and platinum level. While I'm far from a great player at League of Legends



Please ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer them also.

**General Play / Improvement**



*Persistent Issues for General Improvement: Low Elo*



* Warding in different roles. As a jungle main I noticed a major problem in my games was a lack of map coverage. While support knows to buy Sightstone, but this is especially true for jungle. 
* As a front line initiator in jungle, or Jarvan at low Elo I'll initiate but my team will run away. You can make more calls and politely explain with pings what you're trying to do and I found that this often helps. ""Initiating as soon as I get a chance on Caitlyn, I'll CC her down"" followed by green and assist pings made a big difference here.
* Early Oracles as jungle or even support can make a big difference in the early / mid game. Since oracles persists through death now

*Persistent Issues for General Improvement: All Elo*



* Taking responsibility for focus or protection in engagements. If your carry is fed
* In high burst lanes (like against a Caitlyn) buying early pink wards as support helped a lot to prevent damage and get ahead. 
* As jungle, giving up your buffs is too risky and it's better to farm.
* Generally speaking, wolf entry) when ahead and warding defensively (in your jungle) when behind was game changing. Identifying as support what your team needs from your warding helps win at any Elo.




**Attitude / Skill Development Fixes**




* For each game



* As always, and keep playing. Toxicity loses games and while this is a general practice on our cast to do this - it's really important.




Overall, or offensive/defense warding as support (see above.)

1363367433.0,1acy3h,A Short Note on Runes (Unofficial Guide),romanticpanda,46,11,26,"Lately I've seen a lot of questions on runes in Summoner School. I'll try to answer some of those questions here.

**Who am I** 

I'm a Platinum 3 player who peaked at 1550 elo S2 and stopped playing ranked (having gotten my Victorious Janna :P). I'm a toplane and support main. Both of these roles have highly specialized rune pages (I have 3 support pages and 4 toplane pages)

**What are runes?**

Runes are enhancements that players can buy to boost their stats in-game. They are permanent and carry over from game to game

**Why buy runes?**

The bonus stats that runes provide are invaluable to your early game. A Tier 3 flat AD runepage with AD reds and quints, allowing you to bully them with ease.

**When to buy runes?**

If you're a new summoner who wants to try out runes, taking up space. They're pretty hard to get rid of (requires a bit of IP and time recombining runes to higher tiers in order to destroy them), but you can choose to leave them in your rune inventory as a nice reminder of the days when you were level 10 :3

For that reason

**When to use specific runes**

**Marks:**

Armor penetration: very rarely. Junglers can run 3 armor pen runes / 6 flat AD for fast jungle speed

Magic penetration: Any time you're playing a champion that relies on AP damage. 

Hybrid penetration: For hybrid bruisers that want to win lane early on. Kayle uses hybrid marks/quints pretty well

Flat armor: For supports.

Flad AD: For ADCs

Atk speed: For junglers. 15% atk speed is huge for clearing jungle faster

Armor pen: Junglers sometimes run 3 armor pen / 6 AD pages for full armor penetration on jungle creeps.

**Seals:**

Armor: Optimal in all lanes but mid

Scaling HP/level: For mid champions that farm at range and 

Flat/Scaling Mana regen: For mid champions and some supports that need a bit of mana regen boost

**Glyphs:**

Flat MR: optimal on midlaners and botlaners. Good for top lane and jungle too. Get this for a general AD/AP page.

Scaling MR: if you're in a lane vs. an AD bruiser or are jungling. Get this for toplane / jungle page.

CDR: For Janna only. Nobody else benefits from cdr as much as she does

Scaling/Flat Mana Regen: If you're facing an all-AD comp or an AD mid

**Quintessences:**

Flat AD: For AD champs

Flat AP: For all AP-scaling mids and tops.

Movement: Are you playing Ryze? Get one. Also good on junglers for faster ganks.

GP10: Supports should get 3 of these every game.

HP/5 Regen: I know most people don't get this

Flat HP: Good on any tanky champion

Lifesteal: Very good on ADCs for the sustain

**Examples of Rune Pages:**

Standard AP Runepage, magic resist glyphs (either flat or scaling depending on what you're facing), flat AP quints.

Standard AD runepage: Flat AD marks, flat AD quints

Hybrid bruiser (Nidalee, etc.): Hybrid marks, armor seals, MR glyphs, quints are up to you (AD for Nidalee top, HP for Shen, movespeed/atk speed for Warwick

Sustain ADC: Flat AD marks, 2 lifesteal quints, 1 flat AD quint

Standard jungler: Atk speed marks, flat AD quint

Standard support: Armor marks, gp10 quints.


**Conclusion**:

There are lots of other pages that are out there that you could make for a variety of matchups and situations. What's important is that you think about the strengths and weaknesses of what you're playing

Edit: As Takishan and BulletOnABiscuit mentioned, so for example, mid: your ""armor pen"" autos may hurt a bit but your overall trading dps will be lower than if you went for pure magic penetration as you build more AP items.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1acy3h/a_short_note_on_runes_unofficial_guide/

Now for the learning!

You guys know me fairly well at this point for [being relentlessly positive](http://youtu.be/iCqwwTfXr1Q) and often refusing to surrender, not only for the game itself, but for what it taught me as a person.

Poker and solo queue are very similar

What you can take from both is a ""long run"" mentality - individual games will come and go, but that luck becomes weaker and weaker as you pile the games up.  Team feeding?  Whatever, this game's over.  Learn something from the time you have left, fight it out, and then move forward.

To keep this from becoming a 20-page autobiography

* Learn how to play from behind.  You're not going to win your lane every game, farm like crazy, avoid fights, split push.  At the 40 minute mark, one death can throw the entire game - stall until late game and stop the snowball from rolling you over
* Do NOT play ranked if you're not focused, not warmed up, not listening to your favorite music, you name it.
* Practice your CS.  No seriously, force intelligent trades, etc.  If you have to concentrate really hard to keep your CS up, you're missing opportunities in lane.
* Know your playstyle.  Know how much you care about farming versus objectives, etc.  This will guide your champion choices as well as making you aware of how you need to adjust.  For example, I know that I'm a crazy aggressive laner, and I want to pick fights all the time - because I know this, I actively remind myself to calm down if I'm in a lane where I don't want to pick fights, or where I have a sustain advantage versus a damage advantage.
* Be the hero your team needs.  I don't mean champ select
* Coordinate champ select.  Be that Summoner who immediately says ""this is the role I'm best at, but I can be flexible as needed =)""  I immediately assign roles when people call them and ask the quiet ones if they're okay with what's left.  Give people what they want, and don't argue or be difficult when the 2nd pick who hasn't said anything instalocks a role that's been called - just say ""[Summoner 4] - are you okay taking top?""
* Defend the people getting trash talked.  Everybody knows when they screwed up and are losing the game - 90% of the time I'll immediately tell them not to worry about it
* Learn when to go join a fight and when to push.  Know how fast you can take out a tower, which is ~2 kills + assists, plus map control).  Unless you know you're going to swing the tide of a teamfight in your favor, when you see that 3v3 brewing in the next lane, don't waste your time running over.  If you run over and aren't helpful, you just wasted gold/XP/map control - if you would've helped but didn't go, you will likely make up for the lost kills in tower gold.
* Bot inhibitor is IMPORTANT.  If bot inhibitor is down
* When you're winning - win harder!  Except that doesn't mean BIG PLAYS WOOOOO - it means farming, and taking dragon/baron.  Stop taking risks when you're ahead, and be smart.  Save the desperation plays for when you're behind.",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/vwu8l/guidei_just_reached_my_longrunning_personal_goal/

* Lane ganks vs river ganks
* Offensive ganks vs defensive ganks

**Lane Ganks vs River Ganks**

What is a lane gank? That is when the jungler comes directly to the lane without entering the river.

When would you do a lane game? Typically you wait until the lane is pushed so that you can get into the lane brush without being seen.

What is a river gank? This is your standard gank. You come from the river and try to get behind the enemy to block off their retreat.

When would you do a river gank? Typically you wait until the lane is pushed so that you can catch the enemy off guard. Make special note of what allies tell you about ward placement.

**Defensive Ganks vs Offensive Ganks**

Defensive or offensive ganks can be either lane ganks or river ganks. The difference between offensive ganks and defensive ganks is the objective. 

A defensive gank is done to protect an ally and scare the enemy

An offensive gank

1375589680.0,1jnxgr,Weekly Roundup Thread for Everything I Learned Analyzing Jungle / Support Roles,Mylixia,42,4,18,"Hey again everyone


This is another post for the weekly round-up thread summarizing everything I've learned in the support and jungle roles over the course of a week running a live cast with the objective of learning and climbing Elo. 

After every game I take notes and write down what I can improve on and this thread is a summary of those notes in a pretty easy-to-read format. I hope someone gets something out of it. This might be really obvious stuff to high Elo players but is still very relevant to me.


**Support**


* Most important of all support lessons this week was I learned I have to constantly buy green and pink wards in addition to sightstone at all Elos. At low Elo
* I found you almost always want to have an oracles by about 20 minutes whether ahead or behind. This is another step in superior map control. If you are behind you have to try very hard to clear wards from your jungle so people don't get caught and you can get ahead. If you're ahead then you want to clear their wards from baron
* Sometimes picking a support just for counters in lane is inferior to picking a support that works better with your team composition. Planning for mid-game to late-game team fights
* You can skip philosopher stone in lane and not hurt too much if you rush sightstone instead. If I don't need sustain in lane (Nami / Vayne for example) I usually skip it now.
* I really like buying boots of mobility most games on most supports now to help clear wards / place wards and still get back into lane to maintain exp gain.

These basics have helped me a lot so far. Onto jungle!

**Jungle**



* Picks are very dependent on Elo. I've found carry junglers like Lee Sin, Jarvan, etc to be more successful.
* Builds are also very dependent on Elo. In a bronze game last night I went 7-0 Jarvan IV but we lost because I built straight tank (golem -&gt; randuins -&gt; etc) however in a gold/platinum game I was doing this and it was completely fine.
* Important team fight decision making dependent on diving their carry (they're very ahead) or protecting my own (our carry is ahead) has helped win games. Before entering the team fight phase make a conscious decision based on the number of kills the carries have on each side whether to dive their carry or protect yours.
* Don't stay in lane on low-level ganks too long because their jungler can turn on you and the worst and most morale-breaking thing for me has been level 3 deaths / giving double buffs in lane. Conversely you can turn this same concept on their jungle and effectively counter
* I have found my level keeps more consistent if I spend much more time farming and only gank when I am fairly certain I can get a kill. In jungle I always try to prioritize doing ""something"" instead of wandering from lane to lane - and wandering between river or through fog should be a conscious decision to get to a very important objective - otherwise farming is a better choice.



As for some general notes, with how much I have to ward in gold/platinum, the time it would take to build a full locket is substantial. We're still having a debate in the channel about this.

I appreciate Summoner School allowing me to post here and for everyone who has checked us out and gone back and forth. I hope this thread is of use to someone and helpful.

Hi everyone! With Rengar's addition to the League of ~~Draven~~ Legends

Cho'gath is underated in the jungle in my opinion, awesome sustain, and decent ganks if you get used to his style. He also has a variety of build paths and routes, and is not too gold reliant. While good, he's hindered by unreliable CC, highish mana costs, and bad dueling before 6. In this guide, while minimizing the effect of his downsides.

&gt;**Pre-Game Setup**

* If you're not a big spender and don't like Robots or Gentlemen

* For runes, so I recommend them as well. For Reds I run AS for more Vorpal Spike procs, and I run my standard scaling MR Blues. You can change it up as you need to, but I find that this set-up is pretty awesome.

* Cho'gath can do well with any mastery page setup, or 0/21/9 if I'm going for more tanky-initiator. 0/9/21 also does well for this purpose, but I find I'm too squishy.

* Summoner Spells are Flash and Smite. While Exhaust+Smite works too, I will punch you through the internet. Jungling without Smite is just plain silly.

&gt;**Starting and Early Game**

* For starting items, and occasionally, Regrowth+1.

* When it comes to routes, start red and gank, it's hard to find a route that's bad for Cho.

* Start with E

&gt;**Items and Skills**

* Cho'gath has tons of item paths. This should mean that you should focus on building for your team, FoN, and Randuin's are great picks. Bruiser Cho would involve items like Abyssal, Kage's and Wit's End. Good all around items are Frozen Heart, Shurelia's, or really any utility items. Just know that on Cho, CDR is amazing

* You can level his skills very diversely too. If I'm going to be ganking tons, making my Q almost unavoidable. If I need clear speed and more Deeps, leveling E is the way to go. I almost always max Q last, as only the damage increases, but if you're having a stompy game, or wanna do more damage, max it second. Personally, and go E-Q-W-E

&gt;**Useful Tips and Tidbits**

* Don't lead in with Q unless you are 100% sure it is undodgable. Having the laner lead in with CC

* Once you get your ult, so if a fight or objective is coming up, save it to secure the buff or kill.

* Like I said, and even a Randuin's or DFG will let you potentially land an AOE stun/slow every 6 seconds. That's huge. With some AP items, you can turn that into pretty awesome teamfight damage.

* Know that your Q isn't just good CC, even if you don't hit it, as you effectively stopped him in his tracks.

* If you get caught in the jungle, Lee, or Mundo. Use your Q+W to make a grand escape.

I hope I helped some people to jungle the Terror of the Void, and if you wanna play, I'm going on a Cho'gath spree, so I'd be down to queue with some people.

Good luck and have fun,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,badge-guide,t3_ylv1f
1341942198.0,wc60y,How to help your Jungler,mcandre,43,4,42,"Your jungler would love to help you gank, because he will be underleveled.

**Leashing**

Junglers can quickly get to level 2 by getting a red or blue buff. Some junglers are particularly good at stealing the enemy's buffs, or your team's own buff, he needs special care called ""leashing"".

The basic idea is to draw the neutral monsters' attacks to another player so that the jungler is free to attack without taking damage. There are many types of leashes

&gt; When the buff spawns at 1:55, you are usually doing a disservice to your team.

* Don't use multiple leashes! Monsters with multiple leashes will walk back and forth
* If other team mates choose to guard the buff (good against counter jungling)
* If you are leashing, and the buff itself. If the jungler says ""just hit it once and leave,"" then **HIT IT ONCE AND LEAVE!**

If you don't fuck up the leash, and can get an easier early gank (esp. as Shaco).

**Ganking Lanes**

Laners don't always understand how jungling works. They feel entitled to ganks

* Continually chat with your team mates
* Notify your team mates when you see opponents use Summoner Spells (e.g. Flash
* Better than rushing in to kill your lane opponent yourself is to tease him back to your turret and attack him TOGETHER with your jungler.
* Talk with the jungler to decide which of two targets in a lane to kill. If you don't focus a target
* Stun/slow/crowd control the target so that you and the jungler have more time to damage it.
* Buy Sight Wards (75 gold) early and often, or the bushes by Dragon and Baron. This will help the jungler determine the situation better (Are you about to be counterganked?), and it will help yourself immensely, because you can then avoid *being* ganked, and can know when it's safe to push.

**Failed Ganks**

Ganks fail for many reasons. If your jungler fails to get a kill, the target could have all his abilities up and ready, or the laner failed to provide sufficient conditions for success. Shrug it off, and try again later. Give your jungler the space to creep some more, and let him hit other lanes. If he tries to hit your lane soon after a failed gank, the enemy will see it coming, and will wreak havoc on your team.

The jungler does NOT have the responsibility of running to you whenever you demand it. If you fail to hold your lane, such as a champion with low sustain trying to solo top. Next time, think about team composition, not just champions you prefer to play. Stay back more, instead of being so aggressive, and buy Wards! Become a good laner and your jungler will love to help you secure kills.

**Successful Ganks**

He is very educational but the videos are in Korean :( Also

**IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind that he based this off of the Korean meta. I just wanted to give you guys how Koreans view each jungle champion. And this is subjective chart. Nothing is factual. This list was made in June 20th. (Before Nunu buff and what not)

Link can be found [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1h6rwx/jungler_tier_list_rated_by_a_korean_diamond_player/)

1372314968.0,1h5xct,Try this: cdr Ashe support,Insetick,47,10,81,"Ashe has only utility spells

You have a lot of damage level 1, just try to survive. You have more range than the other supports, so you can poke a lot. Use your E to scout before warding. You can also scout the lane bushes to avoid a lane gank. 

I do 4/0/26 for the early cdr, mikael's, cdr boots. Get some more mana regen, max out cdr if you want. Spend the rest of the game spamming w and peeling for your carry.

At max cdr, siege towers, chase, kite, scout bushes, impair positioning in team fights, and set up easy skill shots. I like to get SotEL for cheap damage, and more mana regen. With only SotEL at level 18

In team fights, so feel free to use it whenever you need vision.

Give this a go and see what you think. Max CDR Ashe is kind of like blue ezreal,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1372361259.0,ashe,,t3_1h5xct
1372044370.0,1gy3gv,Champion Guide: Vayne,pkfighter343,42,6,75,"Vayne [](/vayne)

The Night Hunter

I'm going to attempt to teach you how to play Vayne as an ADC with this guide.

Vayne is an extremely powerful hypercarry, which is rare for an ADC. I believe she has the highest outplaying potential out of any ADC in the game.

**Abilities**

&gt;**Passive**: Night Hunter

&gt;Vayne gains 30 movement speed when moving towards a visible enemy champion.

Extremely powerful when cleaning up fights or chasing in lane. Is amplified by her ult

&gt;**Q**: Tumble RANGE: 300 COOLDOWN: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 COST: 30 mana

&gt;BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% AD

&gt;Vayne quickly rolls toward the cursor's location
The enhanced attack does not trigger against structures.

One of the abilities that makes vayne herself. It has the lowest cooldown of any dash on an ADC, you can use it to help you last hit under tower.

A  funny bit of information about her Q: Upon release

&gt;**W**: Silver Bolts

&gt;TRUE DAMAGE: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8% target's maximum health)

&gt;Consecutive attacks and abilities mark Vayne's target with silver rings. The third consecutive attack or spell against the same target will consume the rings
The rings are removed if Vayne attacks a different target or doesn't attack for 3 seconds.

This ability is extremely powerful against tanks late game, a quick combo if you just want to trade quickly is auto -&gt; tumble -&gt; condemn, which procs your silver bolts very quickly and ends the trade. I max this ability second for increased damage to tanks as I transition to the mid game.

&gt;**E**: Condemn RANGE: 650 COOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 COST: 90 mana

&gt;PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 45 / 80 / 115 / 150 / 185 (+ 50% bonus AD)

&gt;MAXIMUM PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 90 / 160 / 230 / 300 / 370 (+ 100% bonus AD)

&gt;Vayne fires a projectile at target unit

This is perhaps the hardest part of Vayne to master. You have to know how far this will knock back (if they will hit the wall) and how their movement will affect the knockback. This ability single handedly gives her the potential to be the strongest dueling ADC in the game due to the stun. The range of this ability is slightly longer than her attack range. It's generally unwise to use this too much in the early game

&gt;**R**: Final Hour COOLDOWN: 70 COST: 80 mana

&gt;Vayne temporarily gains attack damage and enhances her other abilities. While Final Hour is active

&gt;DURATION: 8 / 10 / 12

&gt;BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE: 25 / 40 / 55

Extremely powerful ultimate. It allows you to chase nearly anyone down

**Skill Order**:

I always max Q first for the decreased cooldown and increased damage. It allows you to chase extremely easily when combined with your passive. After that

**Starting Ability**:

If you invade you MAY want to start with E

**Runes**:

My personal rune set is:

9x AD marks
9x Armor Seals
5x MR/level glyphs
4x Flat MR glyps
1x AD quint
2x Lifesteal quints

Reasoning: The main goal of vayne is to farm

**Masteries**:

Standard ADC: 21/9/0

This allows for you to put out as much damage as possible while taking defense for trading and surviviability. Take 4x health per level, put the point in MR into the summoner spell mastery if you take barrier.

**Summoner Spells**:

Flash + Cleanse or Flash + Barrier

Flash is always an amazing spell for reasons you should already know. It has the most uses of any summoner spell; allows you to get away

Cleanse can be used if you are confident in your ability to lane against the champion you are playing against

**Builds**:

There are quite a few common builds on Vayne. My person build of choice will be the first one listed

**My build**: Start Dorans -&gt; Bilgewater Cutlass + Berserker Greaves (get lifesteal first

**Build 2**: Everything is the same until you get to Botrk. Botrk -&gt; Infinity Edge -&gt; PD -&gt; Defense Item (see below) -&gt; Last Whisper. This build gives big damage early but is harder to kite with and requires a lot of money to get working. I don't like the lower attack speed; it feels off to me.

**Build 3**: Start Dorans -&gt; BF sword/Greaves -&gt; Vamp scepter/Greaves -&gt; BT/Greaves -&gt; PD -&gt; LW -&gt; Defense Item (see below) -&gt; Infinity Edge. I don't like this build

**Build 4 (""The JaeWoong build"")**: Starts the same as my build up to Botrk. Botrk -&gt; PD/Shiv -&gt; PD -&gt; Defense -&gt; IE. I don't like this build because attack speed reductions REALLY hurt it

Despite me talking down on the other two builds

**Possible defense item options**: Guardian Angel, Quicksilver Sash, Banshee's Veil

Guardian Angel: Get this when the enemy has a fed threat

Warmogs: Not really good for much anymore

Randuin's Omen: As you may guess

Quicksilver sash: When you don't feel pressured very much and want to have the cleanse to be able to deal more damage. Also helpful if they only really have 1 person diving you and they're magic damage and have 1 form of cc. An important exception is Zed. QSS removes his death mark

Banshee's Veil: Against heavy magic damage or strong initiatons like malphite. Try to keep the shield up as long as possible so you can block important spells in fights.

**Good supports**:

Lulu: She is good with everyone, and cc. Ult keeps people off you and helps you survive in teamfights, as does W and Q.

Sona: Good healing power and good poke as well. Can set up for nice level 6 engages.

Alistar: Kind of cheesy

Blitzcrank: Same as alistar

Thresh: Same as alistar/blitz

Janna: Good peel and strong shield. May be problematic if you need heals for strong poke lanes.

**Medium Supports**:

Soraka: If you really anticipate trouble in the lane phase

Taric: After his nerfs, just meh.

Leona: Can be good

**Matchups**:

**Support**:

*Hard*:

Leona: Tends to be paired with an aggressive adc that can all in you early rather easily. You can use your E to cancel her dash

Sona: When paired with a poking support, this matchup goes down to medium.

Lulu: Good poke and gives you problems when trying to chase later on. Lulu op.

Blitzcrank: Medium/hard since you have a dash

*Medium*:

Alistar: His headbutt is cancelable with your e

Thresh: Since you have a quick, though, and your e can actually cause you to get pulled farther if you knock him back as the hook hits you. Be careful, dodge hooks, and play for later on.

**ADC**:

*Impossible*:

Draven: He wins this lane at almost all points. Even in mid game dueling him is impossible without getting a stun. Farm and don't take auto attacks or he will dive you with ease. Watch out for the Draven Leona combo. He's getting nerfed soon and will hopefully be demoted into hard.

*Hard*:

Caitlyn: She can zone you rather easily early on. If you can get level 2 or 3 before her you can attempt to all in. You will most likely just burn their summoners

Graves: Naturally tanky

Varus: Similar to caitlyn

Urgot: Tends to be unpopular

*Medium*:

Miss Fortune: More of a Medium-Hard

Tristana: Hard to fight against

Ezreal: More of a Medium-Easy if you play it right, try to tumble dodge q's in exchanges and this match up will be a cakewalk.

**Early Game**:

Play passive and farm. The exceptions to this are level 2, NEVER engage a fight with draven unless you are sure you are ahead of him or can 2v1 him.

**Playstyle**:

Vayne is passive early

**Mid Game**:

This is when you start to shine. You're getting a few levels in W now and have your Botrk and maybe even your PD. Teamfights are brewing

**How to use condemn**:

Condemn can be used to cancel dashes in mid flight, and cancel those abilities rather than use them after they're already on you. This can take some practice, but it's worth it.

**Late Game**:

This is where you truly shine. Your team should most definitely protect you because you will shred everyone and everything without any effort. Positioning is key, and don't wander around unwarded areas if there are missing enemies.

**Tips &amp; Tricks**:

* Buying a red pot can help early-mid all ins and let you win lane.

* Taking cleanse may make your lane harder

* Tumbling into a wall will cause the auto attack reset to occur much sooner as it cancels the dash.

* Vayne is not easy to play. I recommend trying her in 10+ normal games before using her in ranked.

Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed the guide

Make sure to point out anything I missed/you think is wrong. I'm always willing to answer questions

Recipe Changed: Dagger + Dagger + Bilgewater Cutlass + 650 gold = 2850 gold  
Attack Damage reduced to 30 from 45

In Spectator Mode

LeaverBuster has been improved to account for client-related issues  
Fixed an issue that would cause some particles to be invisible for the duration of the match (ex: Nidalee spears

Health bars will now display thicker black lines for every 1000 health

Please feel free to correct me and to list out the ones I'm missing.

Obvious things:

DON'T face check the bush (this means just walking in to it) if you're not ready to find a few enemy champs right there waiting for you.

It's more important to stay alive than almost anything else.

You should not always be pushing.  Most of the early game you should probably not be auto attacking.

Some champions can trade better than others.  Figure out if you can trade in your lane

Last hitting is about as important as champion killing.

**STEALING XP** - Players can ""steal"" their jungler's XP by standing too close when jungle minions are killed. A mid lane player who is too close to the Wraiths when they care killed can steal some of their XP. This slows down the jungler's leveling and should always be avoided. Players who help leash or damage jungle minions at the beginning of the game can steal XP by staying around for too long and being within XP range when they die.  
**SUSTAIN** – Typically refers to a champion’s ability to stay in their lane for long periods of time from sufficient health and/or mana regeneration from abilities
**TANK** (a turret) – “Tanking” a Turret means intentionally forcing an enemy Turret to attack you so that it doesn’t attack teammates. This can be achieved by being the first one into its range (when no allied minions are near) or being the first to attack an enemy champion when within Turret range.  More durable champions tank Turrets so that teammates can safely burst down enemies or the Turret itself.   
**TOP** – Top lane of the map.

**TROLL** - To intentionally aggravate players on either team with either: behaviour

**VISION** – “Vision” is map visibility that is primarily attained through the use of wards and Clairvoyance.  A team with a lot of wards in place has “good vision”. A team with no wards has “no vision”.  
**WARD** - Items you buy at the Shop that grant you vision of an area for 3 minutes. Sight Wards are 75g, last 3 minutes and can see invisible things. The invisible things include: enemy champs, enemy wards, and enemy traps (such as Teemo mushrooms).  
**ZONE** - ""Zoning"" an enemy means pushing them back in their lane so that they are unable to CS. If you zone someone ""hard"" then you push them back so far that they are even missing experience.

1325105165.0,nu02f,The Unofficial Absolute Noobs Guide to League of Legends: Part 1 - The Champion,ReallyBroReally,44,7,7,"The Champion

Before a game of League of Legends

There are some champions who do most of their damage by auto-attacking an enemy. An auto-attack is the most basic of damage-dealing methods, the champion has not yet learned any abilities. The summoner (you), must select which ability the champion is to learn by clicking on the (+) box above the desired ability. Each time the champion levels up (more about that later), it is allowed to level up one ability.

At level six, and in what types of situations it should be used.

While a champion may fill many in-game roles, the act of leveling abilities, which does make them stronger. However, a summoner may also choose to purchase **items** for his or her champion. These items can add to a number of stats for the champion, from health, to mana (the resource often used in casting abilities), to cooldown reduction (the time it takes for an ability to become available again). The two stats that most often increase the effectiveness of a champion’s ability to deal damage are **Attack Damage (AD)** and **Abilitiy Power (AP)**. 

Champions abilities often scale off of his or her total AD or AP. It is crucial to understand what abilities benefit from what stat. Generally, and explain how much damage or healing the ability will do. This is usually given in the form of “[flat number] (+ [green number or red number])”. If the number is parenthesis is green, it means that the abilities scales with ability power. If the number in the parentheses is red, it means the ability scales with attack damage.

Your champions ability power and attack damage

The order in which abilities are upgrade and items are purchased is referred to as a **build**. Different builds serve different purposes, it is important to not only understand *what* your build is, but also *why* it is being done that way.

The best way to learn a champion and how he works is simply by playing him. My rule of thumb has always been to play 3 bot games with a new champion (simply to learn the mechanics), and see try those builds in game.

1375494856.0,1jlqew,"LOW ELO Jungler's Pressure and LOW ELO Laner's ""NECESSITY"" for Ganks",jvanswut,42,6,19,"Disclaimer: this is the opinion of a regular

In my experience of playing league of legends in low elo soloqueue, but when it becomes toxic and negative...) Often it's at the disregard of general game knowledge a laner has to keep track of: ward placement/timing, cooldowns on summoners, lvl difference, positiion of the creepwave, and champion to champion interactions and attributes and possible countergank potential. Sometimes these players tend to show negative behavior: constantly nagging, flaming, securing objectives, or have picked INTO your counterpick (yes i've seen it done and these players realize they were countered even if they picked later than their lane opponent and just lose their minds..-.-):

-Play safe (dont trade if you know you're gonna lose, DONT DO IT AGAIN THINKING IT'LL WORK.

-Keep track of Flash/Ignite

-Invest in a pink (as koreans call it: Seduce your jungler with a pink ward)

-be knowledgeable about the lane matchup (INSTEAD OF WHINING IN CHAT THAT YOU WERE COUNTERED) and the opposing champion (the amount of cc skills a champion has, possible damage over time, a power-spike or advantage due to leveling or itemization)

-WARD. To Korean SoloQueue players

-BE AN OPPORTUNIST. improve mapawareness to react to favorable jungle skirmishes, karthus, ezreal, draven etc). Sneakily KS-ing for some gold is good. Picking up some extra cs in a lane you came down to roam or gank is good. Picking up small jungle camps is good. Always look for ways to make money in places other than your lane if you're getting smashed.

-Mechanics ARE important even in a low elo game - dodging/landing skillshots

-GAMESENSE AND DECISION MAKING ARE MORE IMPORTANT

-adapt your itemization to BUILD a little more defensively/utilitarian. NOT SAYING TO RUSH WARMOG ON EZREAL

-if you're being CAMPED, IT MIGHT BE SMARTER to tell your teammates to pursue objectives or easier kills on the other parts of the map instead of constantly spamming your jungler to countergank.

-LEARN THE SYNERGY of 2v2. If you want your jungler to gank your lane with a potential of a counter gank, dps output, jungler's buffs, level and HEALTH*-especially after clearning a big camp in the early levels)

-*EVEN IF, depending on your opponents advantages over you, turn into a 1v2 doublekill for your opponent.

-GENERALLY, dependent person and no one likes a needy person.

I am not the person to call jungle in every game. I'm a laner. But when I see laners abuse teammates and the jungler for uncontrollable variables (enemy camp) and/or for their own mistakes

TLDR; you're losing lane? Sometimes if it's your day a gank will come. but if it doesn't DONT BE A NEGATIVE DICKHEAD AND THINK OF WAYS TO HELP THE TEAM INSTEAD OF WHINING. ANALYZE THE MOVEMENTS YOUR JUNGLER MAKES TO SEE IF HE/SHE IS HELPING THE TEAM IN WAYS OTHER THAN WINNING YOUR LANE FOR YOU. STOP BEING A SELFISH TOXIC MOFO THAT SEEKS TO ENSLAVE YOUR JUNGLER.

1370950547.0,1g44zq,Whose job is it anyway? #4: Objectives,lighthope,41,5,7,"Whose job is it anyway? #4

Objectives are the primary way of winning the game. Sure you can force your enemy to surrender by killing them over and over again, the player, are the cute little bugs just waiting to get fried. Now when I talk about objectives, I primarily refer to turret, inhibitors, dragon, baron and the nexus, and can cause the same results as the other objectives. It’s important to never underestimate the risk of taking an objective!

* Red/blue buff:

The two buffs are primarily contested in the early and mid-game. It´s important to consider the position of the enemy laners and the enemy jungler when attempting to steal or contest an enemy buff. Having vision of the enemy laners allows you the time to react in case they move to stop you. In addition knowing the position of the enemy jungler is important. You need to know how many enemies you might be dealing with, you should and must never expect your allies to come help you.

A good time to invade, that there´s always at least one wall between you and freedom. Champions with high mobility are safer.

Late-game these buff are especially dangerous. People think they can easily steal a buff before leaving the enemy jungle


* Dragon:

Like the jungle buffs dragon also peaks around the early to mid game. The reason is pretty simple. Dragon is easily accessible gold, and the amount of damage it deals is significant. This is why you see top teams immediately disengage dragon, if the enemy teams shows you to contest dragon. Having both the enemy team dealing damage to you along with dragon is too much of a disadvantage in a fight.

A good time take dragon is when you have a numbers advantage. This can be either after killing an enemy or when two or more enemies are in toplane. However keep in mind that high burst champs can perform cleanup duty if you get low from dragon. In addition champs like Ezreal or Lux or other high burst champs can steal dragon either from a far or with their burst. It´s important to always have smite available when starting of a dragon.

Having a pink ward to clear vision


* Baron:

Baron is the biggest and shiniest objective on the map, take it easy, play it safe, don’t try to take baron. Baron deals a lot of damage to your team, and you risk having it stolen or losing the following teamfight, and that is never worth it. Baron should be done, when you have vision of the enemy, you have enough damage to take down baron fast

Making sure you have vision of the entire area around of baron is important. You want to be able to see the enemy arrive, having both him and the enemy team damaging you is too much in a teamfight.

If a jungler comes in to attempt to steal baron too early, that they can spike the baron down before your own jungler can, it’s important to take this into consideration. It’s always more dangerous to take baron against such a jungler.
 
A lot of teams will try to take baron after losing an inhibitor. Usually the other team isn´t ready for another fight and will have to go back. This is a good time to take baron
Having the numbers advantage isn´t always enough to take baron safely. One or two fed enemy champs can easily turn a safe baron into a lost game. Always keep that in mind. Having your own strong champ zoning the enemies away is an optimal way of defend a baron

As a jungler
Preferably you want to finish a game without taking baron at all.


* Turrets:  

Taking turrets are usually a must for winning the game. When taking a turret you should look to have a numbers advantage and vision of the surrounding area

When contesting a turret you need to put damage on the turret safely. Usually the one damaging the turret will be the ADC

Going up against good waveclear champs like Anivia you need to take the waveclear into consideration. As shown in the [match between clg.eu and M5]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGS3HkoBmes) waveclear can stall and even win a game. Knowing how strong your own waveclear is compared to the enemy waveclear is important for pushing down turrets. You can’t keep throwing yourself at a turret for 10 minutes.

 
* Inhibitors:

Compared to other objectives the inhibitor is the “safer” of the lot. The inhibitor itself doesn’t pose any threat to your team. For this reason any damage dealt to an inhibitor during a fight is wasted. You should always focus 100% on the fight rather than the inhibitor. You can always take the inhibitor after winning a fight. When you take down the baseturret and expose the inhibitor you don’t necessarily need to take it. It will continue to be exposed for the rest of the game. Falling back and getting ready for the next fight

* Nexus and nexus turrets (finishing the game):

A lot of times you see teams staying too long in the enemy base

**TL;DR**: Be careful around objectives. Although they are the means to win the game

Every single lane loses hard with no or minimal enemy jungler involvement and I'm basically trying to pick up the pieces on 3 lanes at the same time and people basically just give up and stop trying completely. I've never seen anything even remotely like that situation in ranked, so I don't see how that's helpful champion practice at all (apart from the first ~10 minutes).

We've all had that game. Enemy team picks Fizz so Summoner 2 picks Ryze ""no worries guy lol gg hard counter"" and proceeds to feed and rage. Or the enemy FP's Morgana so Summoner 4 responds with a talon ""silence too stronk gg"" and is 0/4 by 3 minutes. 

I will admit that I too have failed by thinking that simply picking a counter to X champion will let me destroy my lane. One case in particluar I remember was I picked Renekton into Teemo. I got out farmed, but it didn't quite click yet. 

 

A while ago I was playing a game, I thought, so I picked Cho'gath. The game starts and Yorick is playing extremely aggressive and I am losing the lane, but not dieing. ""What the heck, I should win this easily,"" I was thinking to myself when finally I said the most important thing to myself:
 
 

What is it that makes Chogath a counter to Yorick. I was about lvl 4 at the time doing my normal lvling or rupture, spikes. So I thought, well, silence is one thing that gives chogath the advantage, so I should level that first. the other is the passive. I wasn't killing the ghouls for free health/mana, and that hurt my ability to stay in the lane. It should be obvious, but for whatever reason it slipped my mind.  
 
 

People often ask ""what's the best build for x champion"" and people always say ""it depends."" I have been playing for a long time

 

This applies not only when you are countering the enemy champion, I will put some levels in move quick to counteract that.

1343737868.0,xg23a,Welcome to the Irelia Zone. (Free week players look here!),ForteEXE,43,11,47,"Well hello there. I see you are looking at **Irelia, stays in R/SS Vegas.

Irelia is one of the chief examples of tanky DPS

**Disclaimer:** I'm covering a non-Trinity Irelia build. Wickd (2k elo player and most famous Irelia player) and others favor Trinity Tank

Pros:

* Naturally tanky as hell

* Has three damage types

* Has a passive that reduces CC duration (and it stacks with masteries!)

* Is difficult to be forced to last hit under tower due to Q.

* Has a really cool set of blades.

Cons:

* Is VERY farm reliant and can be denied farm by certain solo tops. (who are also popular!) Unless you get fed early/allowed to farm unchecked

* Is melee

* Often gets focused first in a fight (this may not be a con depending on your team

With that in mind, we're off to Never Never Land.

For Runes and Masteries

These would be:

* Armor Penetration Marks
* Flat Armor Seals
* Scaling Magic Resistance Blues
* Move Speed Quintessences

For masteries

This runepage and mastery setup is designed to give Irelia some powerful early/midgame tankiness to hold her over until she builds items.

Let's talk about Irelia's skills:

Firstly

* Passive - Ionian Fervor: Reduces the duration of stuns, fears, snares, immobilizes, blinds and silences for each nearby enemy champion.

    1 champion: 10%
    2 champions: 25%
    3 champions: 40%
    Diameter: 1200 (sight range) 

Does as it says it does. Stacks with Juggernaut and Mercury Treads

* Q -   Bladesurge: Cost: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 mana

Cooldown: 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 seconds

Physical Damage: 20 / 50 / 80 / 110 / 140 (+1.0 per attack damage)

Cooldown: 14/ 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 (refreshes on last hit)

Irelia's gap closer and main source of AD damage aside from autoattacks. Of note is that it will process onhit attacks such as Sheen without you needing to activate the onhit first via another skill. This skill also returns 35 mana on a successful lasthit using Q.

* W - Hiten Style: True Damage: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75

Health Restored While Active: 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 / 26

Cooldown: 15 seconds

Irelia's main skill and what makes her so annoying to lane against most of the time. Also note that the active bonus for health restored is cut in half when the skill is on passive. This is what gives you the ability to put the fear of God into certain tops

* E - Equilibrium Strike: Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 mana

Magic Damage: 80 / 130 / 180 / 230 / 280 (+0.5 per ability power)

Duration: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 second(s)

Cooldown: 8 seconds

Irelia's CC. This makes or breaks ganks. It's very much possible to, and you being fed.

* R - Transcendant Blades: Cooldown: 70 / 60 / 50 seconds

Physical Damage Per Blade: 80 / 120 / 160 (+0.5 per ability power) (+0.6 per bonus attack damage)

Maximum Physical Damage to one target: 320 / 480 / 640 (+2.0 per ability power) (+2.4 per bonus attack damage) 

Irelia's ultimate and source of healing outside Hiten Style. She heals for 25% of the damage dealt to champions

Build:

I prefer the tanky DPS Irelia

* Wriggle's Lantern
* Mercury Treads
* Wit's End
* Frozen Mallet
* Atma's Impaler
* Guardian Angel

This build is designed for all around tankiness, you recieve extra MR and +42 magic damage from Wit's End, which combines with your Q and W to produce a lot of burst damage.

For spells

We've got the basics down

Please bear in mind these are matchups I've personally done. Newer ones such as Jayce

**Matchups you win**:

* Gangplank (He has to rush a Giant's Belt or he won't kill you. His Q harass doesn't do much against Irelia with tanky runes and masteries

* Kennen (Important: Start Null Mantle + 2 potions

* Talon (Talon has no business top anymore

* Poppy (Poppy fears anybody who throws down true damage, ignite/ult to finish the job. Remember her passive does NOT work against true damage.)

**Tricky matchups:**

* Trundle (He has natural anti-CC

* Riven (One of the best definitions of a ""skill matchup"". I don't do this one often enough but know it requires you doing a LOT of baiting and attacking when her shield is on CD. She can run away better than you can however)

* Garen (He's fairly annoying early on with his Q and E spam, back off, they usually try that E-&gt;R combo when their target's at 30-40% HP)

* Lee Sin (He has roids

* Cho'Gath (Honestly I think this is more of a farm lane than a really tricky one. He's naturally high HP and has some sustain. Irelia doesn't do so hot against tanks early.)

* Vladimir (You both have sustain

* Swain (Ranged + Harasses you very easily. He's really easy to oom though

* Malphite (This is going to be controversial. However with my build, autos and Wit's, Malphites almost always stack armor first before anything else, thus they have two resistance holes (and you can't resist true damage) you can exploit. Just be wary of his Q harass early on, and his dive when he hits 6.)

* Udyr (This really, he wins the lane and probably kills you at 2. If he doesn't, congratulations, you've a better shot.)

* Kayle (Sorta want to move this to losing. Kayle is squishy and they almost always build glass cannon and/or like a carry. If you engage when her E is on cooldown, she WILL bait you into harassing with her ult.)

* Nasus (Really, Nasus players love to push with Q spam on minions.)

**Matchups you lose:**

* Darius (Let's face it

* Yorick (Very very annoying, and get armor early on for his impending dives.)

* Olaf (He's packing more true damage than you do

* Akali (She wins early, get MR early as well as HP. Akali hates people who rush MR and HP to stop her bursting. Akali is very vulnerable to being ganked if she can't hide in her shroud. She is also extremely squishy, most top Akalis have armor runes instead of HP/level.)

* Jax (He's burstier than you and can stun you if you stun him. Also can chase you and generally be a pain in your ass.)

* Rumble (He's going to be annoying until he gets his Q nerf in. Best bet is to play passive, if you can get him dead 1-2 times before he gets belt or Revolver, you got a good chance.)

* Renekton (Same as Yorick really, he doesn't.)

**Tips and Tricks:**

* Farm farm farm early game. Your ult

* Your early game sucks until you get farm/kills. Get Razors early on. Getting Wriggle's shoots your sustain up silly high.

* You can use Q to chase somebody out of range

* Irelia is one of the most famous hypercarries. Same thing applies to her that it does to Vayne: **DO NOT GET OVERCONFIDENT.** You can easily screw yourself over if you reach lategame with a lead and think you will carry no matter what you do.

There are plenty of guides for how to play *as* champions, probably for the rest of my life at the rate Riot is releasing champs.  Content will be reposted on [Summoner Academy](http://www.summoneracademy.com) within a day or so.

**Riven - The Exile**

[Abilities and Stats](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Riven)

* **Potential Roles**: Melee AD Carry, gank-oriented AD jungler
* **Lanes**: Top
* **Common item choices**: Doran's Blade (stacking), Bloodthirster, Guardian Angel, Frozen Mallet
* **Things to know**: Lots of short-range AOE CC, very mobile, ult gives range and damage increase with big AOE finisher.
* **Beat her with**: safe early play, stacking armor
* **Good counter choices**: Kennen, Teemo, Nidalee, Malphite, Cho'Gath, Olaf

**Game Phases**

**Early Game**: Play safe and avoid her combo.  Don't be afraid to fall behind in CS to avoid getting killed.

**Mid Game**: Judge the situation to see if you can start trading with her.  Be very careful about her teamfight presence - she will seriously wreck your carries if given a chance.

**Late Game**: You can burst her down if you focus her hard - her shield becomes less effective against big lategame damage.  If she didn't build survivability

**General Playstyle**

Riven is an excellent top lane choice, and her CC can lock a single target down for the entire chain.  In teamfights, her mobility and shield will allow her to march right up to your squishy carries and demolish them before they know what happened.  Her mobility comes from abilities, which makes slows much less effective - but makes silence that much stronger.

* Riven usually wants to win her lane by level 4.  Take away her early-game dominance by playing very safe and not letting her get you in her combo.
* She's pure AD
* Her combo is very strong, and her Q is always a 13-second cooldown)
* Interrupting Riven's combo with hard CC or a silence will drive her crazy and take away a lot of her laning power.  If you can force her to play passively against you
* Riven is a beast under tower
* Her ult CD is 75 / 60 / 45 - that's really short for a big steroid.  It's a 20% bonus AD (!) and a range increase on all attacks for 15 seconds. You do NOT want to fight Riven when she has her ult up - just keep your distance and let it burn itself out.
* Riven is a monster in midgame teamfights - she can use her abilities to quickly get to and lock down the squishy of choice
* Late game
* As a jungler, and she'll suffer greatly for lack of farm.

In my last game, then came to mid and killed our Katarina a few seconds later. In the meantime, I was trying to be helpful on the bottom lane, where (at least!)

This week 2 of my mains went free Jayce and Zed

Zed is probably the best AD burst assassin in my opinion. His kit allows him to do massive damage if played correctly and he's one of the highest skill cap champs so the possibilities of what you can do is endless.

Laning (Top): at level 1 you can choose Q or E

Basically what you want to do in lane is farm and watch for when your minions get low. When they try to cs hit them once with one auto and E and back off and maybe throw a Q if you have energy. Don't ever stop harassing keep them chugging pots

Once you hit 6 just all in them, Zed's ult can potentially do the most damage out of everyone's lv1 ults.

Teamfights: like all assassin what for everyone to engage and use their skills before you go in. Be patient and look for an opening in the frontlines for you to R in and kill their carry. Always save either a flash or your W to disengage with after you killed their carry.

Tips and Tricks
- use WE to harass safely if you cant aim skillshots for shit like me

- you can shadow E twice if you use E right after you use W

- use flash + W to cover a shit tons of distance

- E interupts your AA so dont E if your about to AA

- a good way to gapclose is WEW

- Each shuriken does 50% less dmg to the same target so if you and your shadow's Q hit someone

- you cant hit someone with 2 E so if you shoot your shadow out and use E

- your R will shoot a shadow out BEHIND the person when you ult,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,zed,,t3_1irmfe

My promotion series went like this:

**Game 1** - They picked my Singed so I went Sona.  We dominated our lane

**Game 2** - Duo'd with a friend, I went 7/5/10

**Games 3-4** - I knew it wouldn't be so easy.  We lost the next two games.  I tried my hardest and farmed up well but we couldn't pull it off.

**Game 5** - Singed top vs. Jayce.  After 40 minutes I ended up with almost 300cs.  But he had 250 and was 14/8/8.  He was strong.  Our game went back and forth and I was concerned about possible troll picks with our shaco jungle and jarvan mid.  We had an inhib down, someway, a miracle happened and our vayne morphed into doublelift getting a triple kill while he was out on his own and then finished up the last 2 that showed up in lane to try to kill him.  It was like he just got bored of the game and flipped a switch.  I saw a God.  To you good sir - I thank you for my Gold!

I used a lot of information from Summoner School to get here.  I researched, have a full time job and live in NYC (busy/crazy life ha).  So I'm really excited/proud of this accomplishment.  Of course I'll shoot for the next level, but I reached my goal of Season 3 and feel pretty damn good about it :)

This post was to say thanks to all of the diamond/plat guys answering questions in this sub (your feedback doesnt fall on deaf ears) and to also offer any advice I may have to those trying to get where I am.  Feel free to ask me anything.  Good luck everyone!

1368821646.0,1ejdrt,[Journey From Bronze] Tips and tricks from a Gold and Diamond player adventuring through Bronze!,FlaxxtotheMaxx,44,9,43,"Hello summoners!

I own a pair of Bronze accounts, it might be Plat, or even Diamond. We're not very good at planning.

Here is some more information about Journey From Bronze:

* You can [follow our progress and find replays through this spreadsheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArnAs1sbDO2VdEE3SFAwZk9RU3ZrUVNSNFRWNUhnb1E&amp;usp=sharing)
* We will only be duo-queueing for bot lane to show how a good duo bot can play to win the lane. Otherwise
* Each game will be recorded and all replays will be uploaded. We'll probably be doing some commentary on Youtube as well.
* My main account, Blanket Ninja, is Diamond 5.
* The purpose of this mini-series is to show how the many tendencies of various Leagues and how to exploit or fix them as a player.

We're not the best players

---------------------

* **Skillshots and poke.** Players at this level generally have lower mechanical skill than at higher levels; they were not as adept at dodging skillshots and respond poorly to aggression. I was able to win lanes just by poking as Nidalee through autos and spears with no retaliation - they would simply back off as I poked them.

* **Junglers and their camps.** I am unsure if this is common throughout Bronze, neglecting the other buff for most of the game until I decided to take it for myself. What was also kind of weird to me was that AP mid laners never asked, nor solo'd, the blue buff, so I took it for myself even after pinging it a few times to see if anyone else wanted it. This is a huge amount of experience left untaken by junglers, and I found it really interesting.

* **Wards.** I've been surprised twice from cheesy level one ganks, their bottom lane camped the river brush until we were a little beyond it before coming in behind us.
In general, if not all, incoming junglers.

* **Teamfight focus.** Teamfights were chaotic and wild and everyone chased too far. Despite being a high priority target, high priority targets were often positioned very poorly - if they were focused down, teamfights would be a lot faster and easier.

* **The importance of objectives.** It appeared to me that the most contested objective in Bronze was middle tower; teams rarely grouped elsewhere for dragon or contesting buffs. In addition, both teams would reset and continue the eternal duel in midlane. 

* **Attitudes.** I haven't had any really pleasant encounters from others in Bronze yet. When I did well

Player 1: adc pls

Player 2: mid

Player 3: top

A Purple Marmot: middle or top please

Player 4: adc

Player 1: WTF DUDE

Player 1: SRSLY

Player 1: im picking twitch

Player 1: idc

Player 1: we shoose at the same time [this was untrue

Player 1: so you cant say pick order

-------------------

A quick note from /u/blanketninja:

I think there will be a lot of interest in coming out with full game commentaries as I play through these games (especially on support). I'm already in the process of starting to do this; I'm currently uploading a full game commentary on MF and Nidalee support (!). I hope it's something a lot of people are interested in
If nothing else
We're currently in the opening stages of this project, suggestions, or even fun challenges to do will all be welcome and we're pretty much free to switch up any and everything depending on what garners more interest.

That's about it for part one! If you have any comments/questions/suggestions

1362686712.0,19v4jc,How To Learn...Mechanics of Learning,Angel_of_Clumsiness,41,7,11,"**Greetings Summoners!**

Welcome to the 2nd installment of my ""How To Learn..."" series. This time we'll be diving into some of the mechanics of learning itself, it's gonna be a bumpy ride!

**Information Overflow** 

At its core, dying afterwards due to an acute lack of health and an oversaturation of bullets and/or arrows, some of them to the knee.

But I'm not talking about the information granted or lost throught the misguided little pink fellow in my example above, the information you need to compute in an average LoL match is mindblowingly huge. From the vantage point of pure information processing, a game of Lol is much like being in ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", except that you're not posed *one* question but *twenty*, you only have 1 second to give all the correct answers, and instead of the friendly host with an enigmatic smile there's a huge, angry crocodile sitting in front of you, have in mind the crocodile speaks only portuguese.

Just to chalk up a few of the things you need to know to play somewhat successfully:
what your abilities do, how they interact with your surroundings, with your items, with your opponents, with their items, same for your summoner spells, your champions' passives, your health and mana, the gold total acquired through creeps, of the enemies' towers

Phew, and you can easily equal mind to blown.

So how on earth are you supposed to keep track of all that?

Simply put


**Easy Rider** 

The conscious processing capabilities of most humans are somewhat limited. There's only so much you can think about at the same time, especially when household chores are considered. On the other hand, our *sub-conscious* doesnt seem to be that limited. Many of humanity's great ideas gestated while the mind of the owner was somewhere else completely, watching clouds under an apple tree, or playing with the ancient greek equivalent of rubber duckies in a hot tub. In creativity theory this part of the thinking progress is called incubation, because you just sit there and let your head work it out by itself, giving you time to do the dishes after all.

In the learning process there is something similar called internalization. When you first encounter something new, and I assume you are managing just fine. The most commonly used example of internalized learning by adults is driving a car - most people get to the point where they can completely remove conscious effort from cruising that chrysler, letting subconscious decisionmaking and muscle memory flow so they have time to check their twitter account, to varying levels of success and health insurance.

What's that got to do with League of Legends? In the essence, item builds and map awareness. The more you figure out how *that* works, the more you can wrap your head around team compositions, matchups and later on global team-based strategy. It's like a pyramid of skills where you need to complete one tier to be able to think about the next and interalize this one in turn to move on. 

Sure, where people are easily baited into playing unfamiliar champions because ""malph OP! U must pick!"" or ""fiddles counters vlad! gogo!"". It is also the reason why so many people suggest mastering one, and only one champion to climb the ranking ladder with, because if you stick to one skillset to internalize through repetition you have an easier time accessing the higher functions of this games' strategic depth. Watching the pro players at the LCS and other tourneys I am regularly struck with awe at the precision, timing and decisionmaking they exhibit, granted by talent, but mostly LOTS and LOTS of practice. Many teamfights there are a firework of abilities, flashes and ultimates that I have trouble even following as a spectator, thank you!

Easy, in theory, yes, but its not all *that* easy. It would take a very disciplined mind to manage to internalize one thing and only start the next one when its finished, but it really is quite boring to just try to master Veigars Q before even touching his E, and it takes a looooong time if you really have your mind set on doing only that (Youtube proves me wrong on this one :). 

Human learning is also mostly *non-linear*, and later we start figuring out how A *really* works. We also keep forgetting and re-learning stuff all the time. So if you focus on learning one champ, take a break, play another one, you will have to re-learn the first one, at least in part. The bright side is, this gets faster everytime you do it
But now: *Onwards to some actual advice!*

* *It really pays to stick to one champion*. Or a few champion of a specific role. Try to find champs you enjoy playing, enjoy playing tanky AP's and supports, it suits my mindest. Find your stuff, focus on it as long as your attention span allows and you're having fun doing it, then branch out, come back eventually armed with new knowledge.

* *Set yourself a small learning goal when you play*. Nothing big, even if you lost the game horribly, you can look back at your criteria and figure out what you did *well*. It really helps your positive outlook. On the other hand, don't get carried away by winning, if you can. Being in a good mood lends itself to looking back at mistakes without feeling bad about your own performance. It might be a good moment to realize that your support really bought *all* the wards that saved your life.

* *Expect to play worse when encountering something new*. Trying out a new champion? Giving the latest item build a whirl? Figuring out the new patch? Faced suddenly with Anit-Bruiser-Bruiser-Lux in top lane? Chances are, it really is part of the learning progress. As a rule of thumb, when facing the unknown mysteries of the unconventional pick, better play passively on the safe side before you find out that yes, AD Leblanc bot *is* a thing that hurts like a b****.

* *Be patient with yourself*. There is an overabundance of things to learn in LoL. Not only that, nerfs, new items, new champions, new metas. This is what makes it the exciting game we love. It also makes it overwhelmingly complicated. Its ok to not remember how Mordekaisers ult interacts with Kog'Maws passive, or what parts of Zyra's kit interact how with Morgana's Black Shield, or wether you take 350 or 349 damage from Leona's Solar Flare due to your cool glasses. Just register the new stuff, and maybe it'll pop out like a shac-in-the-box the next time you'll need it.

That's it for now! This really turned out longer than I expected

The easiest is buying wards. 

Many bronze-level players seem to think that supports are responsible for all the warding. This leads to a lack of information and giving up map control. 

Supports can not and should not be the sole warders on a team. Junglers traditionally help in this role

Secondly, move with your support if they need to ward. ",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,
1355205268.0,14nheb,AD carry selection ,2marston,44,9,61,"In light of a recent thread where someone was asking which AD carry to pick when

**AD carries**: 

Bursters: Corki

Traders: Draven, Vayne, Sivir, Twitch

Pokers: Caitlyn, Ezreal

**Supports**:

Poke: Lulu

Sustain: Soraka

Aggressive: Alistar, Blitz

Now here are the suggested AD carries vs common lanes:

**Burst AD

I suggest picking a strong defensive AD against a lane like this. Either the tanky passive of Graves

**Trade AD

These lanes will try to force you into trades which will be detrimental to your laning. I suggest picking a poke AD against this lane. You want to do damage from range with something like Cait auto attack or Ezreal Q but stay out of range of the opposing AD carry. If they manage to get more than 1 auto attack on you

**Poke AD

This is an annoying lane to be against. They will try to force you out of lane by out sustaining you. I personally like to counter these lanes with aggressive tactics. Pick a burst AD such as Graves, it will often result in forcing the opponent out of lane due to extremely low hp.

**Trade AD

These lanes can be deadly. The support will attempt to cc you to give time for his AD to damage you. It is a strong strategy. I would suggest the strongest counter to be a poke AD. Play a champion such as Cait or Ezreal and poke at the enemy support as they try to get in range to cc you. You can take their health down gradually which means they are too low to engage. If they try to engage on low health they will lose the fight. If you want to use a poke AD like Ashe or Kogmaw

**Burst AD

This lane will usually just push you extremely hard, such as Vayne, Ashe or Kogmaw (Yes various categories) and farm what you can. You don't need to out-farm their AD, just stay as close as possible. They have picked a strong early game champion with a support which gives them low kill potential. It allows you the opportunity to take a weak laner and play for late.

I'll try to explain it better, that means you can fit that spell 3 times in those 30 seconds.

what if you would have 40% cooldown reduction ? that would mean the spell has 6 seconds cooldown

so going from 3 to 5 uses of a spell. that is 67% more. If it would be 40% then you would have 4

What does this mean ? Getting that max cooldown helps a lot with spell rotations, but something to consider when you are deciding what to buy :)

This is also the reason cooldown reduction is capped at 40%, any more cooldown reduction than 40% would be very overpowered.

Right now the meta revolves around ap mid, and a jungler.

Let's start with ap mid. This is the best choice in terms of mid-late game. Ap's benefit far more in damage gain per level than ad's, harass, and stay relatively safe. A level 10 ranged ad with the same farm as a level 10 mage will get gibbed. This should never be the case because any ranged ad going mid will get harassed to death. There are maybe 2 ad's that can handle the massive harass that Ap's throw out (and that's with heavy zoning)

Bruiser top-Top is probably the lane that's most considerably evolving in the meta. You see new FoTM tops all the time. The main goal for a top is lane stability

edit: Bruisers need to have heavy sustain because they are alone in a very big lane. They need to be able to take some damage and stay in lane to farm. They only have themselves to rely on during early-mid game.

Ranged ad/support bot- DRAGON CONTROL. This is why bot is the 2v2 and not the top. Controlling dragon can control the game. You want to be able to have 4 people at dragon in seconds (5 if top takes tp). This needs to be your team gold. Not theirs. The reasoning for a ranged ad with a support is sustain. Most ad's can't survive alone early game, but for your team. You don't want anyone to get zoned all game, or killed. 

edit:  Ranged Ad's benefit far more from items than from skill levels. While these do help with providing higher damage

Support keep ranged ad's safe. Some of you may say ""well why don't we just not run ranged ad then?"" Ranged ad is extremely viable late game. They throw out massive sustained damage from a distance after they pick up that first BF item

Jungler- This allows you to have 2 solo lanes, and baron. Also provides gank potential to help your lanes prosper. Would you rather be on the team with 4 lvl 10's and a lvl 12, or the team with 3 lvl 10's 2 lvl 12's and all the buffs? Think this is fairly clear.

I think this give a pretty big boost to AD carry damage and might make Taric and Sona more viable since their W's are now the rare armor auras in the game. However looking at the benefits of Aegis vs. Command Banner I realized that no support should bother building Aegis as their first go to item since the individual items only stack some health and magic resistance. Not only does the passive of banner grant the same health regen but gives better stats to the support: +40 ability power and 10% reduction AND +10 more armor there really isn't much a reason to go Aegis or Locket unless the opposing team is AP heavy.

Plus Command is an item that can be a great laning aid if you promote a seige minion thus allowing a support to increase passive push in lane. With Elise being FOTM this item can actually boost spiderling damage and make her even stronger

Edit: read up on the passive giving a boost to minion AD and AP which means passive push gets ramped up much more than I thought

1373148663.0,1hrr1m,Getting Caught PSA,Yelwah,44,8,10,".     In this post I hope to clarify what getting caught is



**What does getting caught mean?**



.     For the most part, if someone snipes a tower, then dies, that's not getting caught, they traded a death for a tower. (I'm not saying that's a good idea all the time however). First I'd like to clarify I'm talking in the general sense after laning phase, dying on gank happens for similar reasons, but should be addressed separately and is not really ""Getting Caught"". Players over extend for 4 main reasons. 
* 1. For CS
* 2. Chasing For Champion Kill
* 3. Warding
* 4. *Attempting* to kill an objective (tower/drag/baron)

.     Now all these things can actually be grouped under one umbrella root cause. Not properly utilizing the mini-map. Which Leads into the next question.



**How do you avoid getting caught?**



.     At ALL times in a game

.     Lets jump into a scenario. Your a top laner. There is a nice new wave of CS just past the dead tower of your enemy. You beat them in lane and are even confident if they return to your lane you can kill them. You have a ward in the river already so your good right? Nothing else you need to worry about. WRONG. You should first and foremost realize that that ward does not cover all possible entrances to kill you

.     Second, long initiaters) that could potentially catch you. Third. Think about if you have the ability to A) Easily escape from a gank from the Jungler or B) Kill the Jungler and the laner. Although this is specific to this situation the idea behind it is the same in any situation, identify all possibilities and variables before making an action like pushing, this takes only seconds at most, and can monumentally improve game play. 

.     Another quick example is as an ADC or APC, and you'll deal the most damage in team fights, but either you need effective escape, effective mobility to avoid their CC, or most easily, just avoid the 2v1 all together. Simply think about the possibilities, and what they would be thinking. If they see lonely ADC in the bot lane, first off, they got away but so did you. 

.     Getting caught while warding. It is a fine line between getting yelled at for not warding

.     Finally, as soon as you get on one of there towers, you have to expect they're sending people for you. Unless they are distracted by another objective, almost never can you get away with sneaking a tower, especially anything past the outer tower. 

.     Often people say they were ""split pushing"", do not assume all you have to do is constantly push a lane, it requires good attention and a similar distraction for the rest of their team. 

.     Now on to dragon and baron. This is also quite simple. If they outnumber you, suiciding for dragon can be worth early game, but is pretty much never worth it late game.



**Oops! I'm caught. What now?**



.     Getting caught is inevitable and sometimes our reasoning skills and assessing our safety is just not going to work, forget about TF ulti, etc... It even happens to the pros in tournaments, so although you should attempt to avoid it at all costs, you still need to farm effectively and get kills in order to win the game and sometimes you will be in a sticky situation. 

.     First thing is first. We're going to employ a similar run down of possibilities in order to assess what the best course of actions is. Now getting caught happens fast so this list of things to think about is quite simple in order to be able to make the decision quickly. First off is it even possible to escape? If no teammates are around, give up. It sounds bad but saving your summoner spells and ulti for future engagements after you respawn can be very helpful. 

.     On the other side. Look for those same things. Is there a good wall you can flash over to create distance? Go for that. Is there a teammate close enough? Go for them. Now this implies they are coming toward you to help, I've seen it before and its just mean. Lol.

**GAH! NOT AGAIN! My teammate is caught! What do I do?**

.     Obviously spam chat with hate messages yelling at the victim for getting caught. It happens in every game soit must be an effective method to win! NO! NO! NO! I am obviously being sarcastic. There is proper courses of action to take in this situation. Can you save them? If you turn a 2v1 into a 2v2 or your buddy comes to make it a 2v3 you may want to turn and turn their gank on their head. 

.     However, 4, or 5 to one. Don't be a hero. Let leave that soldier behind. Its so sad. But almost always going in to help a caught teammate is basically just putting whipped cream and a cherry on top for the other team, they get an extra free kill from nowhere. Again, don't just react, try to think if you have any spells that could get the poor guy out, and if not, avoid initiating a team fight when someone is caught, but an opportunity to take an objective.

.     And to the point I poked fun at in the beginning of this paragraph. Obviously its never a good idea to yell at your teammates. But even saying ""Don't get caught please"" probably won't help much. Try to guide your teammates where to go by calling out objectives to go for or defend, they get the satifaction of complying and making it feel like their own decision.


**TL;DR** Im so sorry for the length, just keep in mind the variables going into your positioning at all times to avoid getting caught!

It's the bane of all junglers when the smite is missed and a key objective is gone to the other team...

So to help avoid that

* Check how much true damage your smite will do while your team (or the enemy team) is attempting baron or dragon. Do this by moving your cursor over the smite icon and read the info box.

* Then click on dragon/baron and look to the top-left corner of your screen to see how much health it has while your team or the enemy team is securing it. This also allows you to see the rate the dragon/baron's health is going down.

* SMITE IT when you see the health is close to how much damage your smite will do to it.

*** Remember to time your smite with another damage skill (if in good position to do so) - as Cho, even if it's just Eve's Hate Spikes - this makes it easier to outsmite an opponent who isn't considering the extra damage the ability gives you, especially if he was depending on outsmiting you with higher smite damage due to a level advantage. 

***  Check the enemy team, he jumps in 1 sec later, makes you airborne and smitesteals, flashes out before too big damage is applied to him. Long range CC will stop you from smiting.


*** Depending on the damage output that the dragon or baron is taking

*** This helps when securing or stealing red/blue buffs too.

**ITEM BUILD**

Don't forget ! As a jungler,..). Who is fed, who does massive damage, do YOU need damage, for the TEAM, and not for you etc etc. You have to consider so many factors while buying.

Some item path :

**1st Build : Normal Build /**

[Hunter's Machete] &gt;
 
[Boots of Speed] + [Madred's Razors] &gt; (Try to back with 825g to get one ward)

[Locket of the Iron Solari] + [Mercury's Treads] &gt; (Build the KindleGem 1st

[Warmog's Armor] OR [Sunfire Cape] &gt; (Warmog for tanking

[Randuin's Omen] &gt; (Huge item against ad

[The Black Cleaver]. (If you want some damage in late

**2nd Build : Against Double AP /**

[Hunter's Machete] &gt; 

[Boots of Speed] + [Madred's Razors] &gt; (Try to back with 825g to get one ward)

[Aegis of the Legion] + [Mercury's Treads] &gt; (Get MR and life fast

[Runic Bulwark] &gt; (When you got it

[Locket of the Iron Solari] &gt; (Really good against AoE damage

[Warmog's Armor] &gt; (Really good against AP

[Randuin's Omen]. &gt; (Huge item against AD

**3rd Build : Good early start (3 kills in 7-8mins

[Hunter's Machete] &gt; 

[Boots of Speed] + [Wriggle's Lantern] &gt; (With 3 kills

[Giant's Belt] + [The Brutalizer] &gt; (If you are really ahead

[Sunfire Cape] &gt; (Armor for dives

[The Black Cleaver] &gt; (You should be snowballing

[Randuin's Omen] &gt; (DIS ITEM IS JUST TOO STRONG)

These build are some example and SHOULD NOT BE YOUR CORE BUILD. You can be disagree with this. Try to 
think by yourself EVERY GAME

________________________________________________________________________________________________
**ANALYSIS OF MY BUILDS**

**1st Build : The ""Normal Build**

So in this 1st build I recomend to don't finish the lantern firstly. Xin doesn't need sustain in the jungle when his W heals him enough. His base damage are really good
I recommend after the Locket of the Iron Solari. Xin scales very well with CDR (cooldown reduction). With that, an other dash coming up. And for only 2200 gold, he'll win 30 Armor, 400HP + a shield which is very good for this price.
Warmog or Sunfire Cape ? It's up to you. I like the Warmog to tank the AP caster with burst
The Randuin's Omen is, you gains massive armor and health. Against a 4 item AD carry, you'll be able to tank him really nicely (until he gets Infinity Edge).
The Black Cleaver

**2nd Build : ""Against Double AP""**

As a jungler
So I wants to rush LIFE and MAGIC RESIST as fast as possible. If forget the lantern : 900g won already.
I'll rush the aegis who provides LIFE and MAGIC RESIST. After I'll get the Mercury's Treads.
Aegis is REALLY important against this composition
After i'll get the Bulwark, and for your team.
And finally
This is you core build against that composition. If you are behind
If you are ahead

**3rd Build : ""Good Early Start""**

I said you can save 900g if you don't build the Lantern. Build when you are really ahead, earlier if your laner is already fed.
Don't go full AD build, or protect yours from the ennemy's bruiser and let them end the fight.


This is an analysis of the these three builds. I've explained you why am I building this or this on which circumstances as much as I can. Sure it won't cover all the situations but I hope this will help.
Don't forget : It's MINE point of view

________________________________________________________________________________________________
**AS A JUNGLER**

Xin is a really good jungler actually due to his huge steroids.
His ult can gives him 100 Armor and MR
His base damage are awesome especially on the Q and the R
His passive
And his low-CD AoE slow dash (every 5-6sec). He can almost spam it on teamfight

He doesn't really needs the blue
His clean time is correct
As a counterganker he is really awesome. At lvl 3,...). He'll totally crush you.

1361200953.0,18r4k5,Hi I would like to get better at Jungling.,Dkas,38,7,55,"Hello

My name is Dkas.Before I start to ask Questions I would like to give some insight about me.
In Season three I managed to reach Gold tier division 2.
http://i.imgur.com/ndxenPs.jpg

I reached gold tier division two from division 4 by solely playing Jungle.
I was in EU-NE and decided to transfer back to EU-W because of my friends there.
While my stats ( Games I played ) transferred with me I got placed into the Silver tier division 3.Most likely because I was Silver Tier division 3 when **I LEFT** for EU-NE. 

http://i.imgur.com/V9lFE54.jpg
I contacted  Riot-Support about this particular problem.I was left without any help.I duo-Q with my friend
and tried to get back to gold tier 2 (my friend was Silver 1 but a Gold player like me ).
The real problem now was something that sadly riot should be blamed for and something that I didn't realize myself until it was too late.**I WAS STILL BEING MATCHED UP** with Gold Tier 2 +  people (Due to my hidden elo from east ? )Combined with my friend who was Silver 1 our duo-Q backfired and turned into an insane mix of silver

After a good amount of games I finished up in Silver Division 1.From there I got 6 times into my
promotion games for Gold.I lost All those opportunities  though.Gradually my Hidden elo was sinking 
to the point where I actually got demoted to a ""true"" Silver player.I never understood how things
could go so wrong.So I started to question myself.There are two things I always struggled with while jungling

1) Ganking: As a lot of people know laners tend to exaggerate against Junglers.You didn't gank
necessary it is to gang in this elo range.People think that jungler are ganging  machines and I disagree
with this.Whatsoever
I hit my major problem there

2)Farming/Objectives: As a Jungler I thought I should always strive for jungle control instead of gangs.I know that there are specific Junglers that are supposed to gang or farm.

 
Every single advice and help is welcome.Feel free to add me aswell in game.DKAS.
I'm online most of the time and I play quite often.So i accept every sort of advice
even if it is harsh.

 
Thanks a lot


**TL;DR : I want to be a Jungler that can influence the game and win.**

100 wins and 100 losses!  


I jumped into ranked before I was ready and it took a long time to break even. Recently I went on a rampage with Hecarim (74% win rate now) and I slowly climbed back up.  

 

I have improved a lot as a player but I owe my recent success to learning how to exploit 1100 elo junglers. My lanes help me get a smiteless blue and I immediately counter the enemy's first red buff. I make sure I ward their blue around 7 minutes and since they want to donate it to their mid laner, but for now it's been netting me some easy wins. :)  


Another thing I like to do is take exhaust as my second summoner spell. I camp two lanes (either mid+top or mid+bot)

I usually take a break after 1, and return refreshed.


Sometimes you have lucky streaks or unlucky streaks of +-200 elo


It's hard for me to judge if you became better or worse since i've never seen you play.


If you won your lane


My last point brings me to how to improve, or getting ganked? If you got ganked, should you have played more defensive, should you have seen it coming? There is alot of questions you need to ask yourself after every defeat AND victory. Doing this will let you improve on your faults actively. You can't really fix the problem, if you're not sure what it is.


At this point, as long as you played your game and didn't give up, you did all you could. If you win your lane EVERY SINGLE GAME (nobody does) you will ALWAYS rise in elo.
Think of it this way


Eventually the percentage will even itself out and you will be at the elo you belong. Just let that sink in for a while.


I didn't intend for this to become this long
But first and foremost, yell to your friend on skype or at your screen.

1375851197.0,1jv4dv,Safe go-to champs for each role?,minimalistical,43,9,94,"I'm very wordy when typing

I main support, though I'm not very good at it, but the thought of jungling stresses me out. I was thinking today about my ""safe"" champs - champions that are either forgiving to play or ones I'm comfortable enough with to safely be able to play even in unfavorable matchups, against unfamiliar opponents, or in unfamiliar roles. The champs I consider safe picks due to familiarity I know no one can suggest, but I was wondering what relatively safe picks for each role are. Before I ask that, though

Like I said, but she can work in just about any game, and I'm very familiar with her. After Lulu, I'd say Thresh and Sona would be the safest picks; Thresh for tankiness and shielding, and Sona for healing and stunning. My other supports (Alistar, Blitzcrank, Fiddle, Morgana

My go-to safe mid pick is Brand, if not win lane, then avoid losing lane with. My main problem, in any role, is being outranged - I have a hard time dealing with that - but with Brand I can hold my own even if outranged. After Brand, Lux and Morgana would be my next safest picks. Cassiopeia, LeBlanc, Ori

For top lane, but his kit is forgiving enough that I've started picking him almost every time I have to play top, since it's a lane I'm not as experienced at. Before Kennen, Teemo was my safe pick for top, mainly because I could be annoying without necessarily winning my lane. Yi, Nidalee, Riven, Shen

I rarely play ADC, and Corki. However, my favorite ADCs to play are Cait and Varus, so I'm not quite sure why I don't have them yet. Of the ADCs I currently own, though, I suppose MF would be my safest pick.  

As for jungling... I'll be honest and say I'm a really bad jungler. I can never manage to show up at the right lanes at the right time, I have Nautilus, Nocturne, Nunu, and Udyr to choose from. Of those, Naut is my safest pick, simply because Thresh and Blitz have made the hook second-nature to me.  

As you can probably see from my champion list, only four lack CC of some sort - Soraka, Yi, Corki, and Nidalee. I never play Soraka unless requested to do so, Yi feels awkward to me, Corki has an escape instead, the one champion I own that I failed to mention so far is Ryze

**TL:DR**  

All of this brings me to my question: who do you consider safe picks in each role? I know it will vary greatly depending on the person

1371690499.0,1gp3bs,[Guide] Jungle guide: Welcome to the Jungle! (First time jungle guide),Carlboison,39,6,21,"###Quick Info

Hello everyone it's me Carlboison

---
###What is my loadout? (Masteries

Each champion will require a different type of rune/mastery combo to be efficent to the max


* [Beginner **AD** Masteries](http://imgur.com/kperZm3


* [Beginner **AP** Masteries](http://imgur.com/CQd1FRv) - This have about the same focus as the AD one

* [Beginner **AD** tank Masteries](http://imgur.com/FTvfcvH) - This you would want to use on the tankier guys which utelize AD DMG


* [Beginner **AP** tank Masteries](http://imgur.com/2NrNCto) - This is something you can use on tankier AP champions

---

Runes is a important part in the jungle

[Runes for Attack Speed junglers](http://imgur.com/6niSCL9) - You would want to use this on junglers that get something from attack speed Example Champ: Nocurne [](/nocturne)

[Runes for AD junglers](http://imgur.com/E9m94Up) - This would allow you to clear the jungle fast while still haveing the ArP to help you do more DMG in ganks

[Runes for AP junglers](http://imgur.com/b9YQoKe) - This gives you the armor you need to survive with the dmg you need for clear speed/ganks

[Runes for AD Tanks](http://imgur.com/I5qpIsU) - This are the runes you would want to use on the AD tanks which gives them a decent clear speed and gives them some ArP for the ganks

[Runes for AP Tanks](http://imgur.com/ejzaE39) - Many AP tanks scale off health of some spell they have



*---Please remember that these things are not set in stone
---








---
###What items do I start with?

On *Most* Champs you would want to start with the items:

* [](/huntersmachete) - Laters upgrades to [](/madredsrazors)(If you Auto Attack a lot)  OR [](/spiritstone)(On tanky/AP champions)

* [](/healthpotion)x5

Exeptions could be:

* [](/clotharmor) - On Rammus [](/rammus)


* [](/amplifyingtome) - On Fiddlesticks [](/fiddlesticks) 

But always take item+pot.
And don't forget the spell [](/smite)

---
###Where do I start?
If you decided to use a champion with mana it is very standard to start killing the ancient golem which is the monster located: 

* [Here for blue team](http://imgur.com/vPcfmUq).

* [Here for purple/red team](http://imgur.com/kpL4rqb).

Killing the Ancient golem[](/golem) will grant you a **BLUE** buff (See below)

&gt;This unit regens 25 flat mana regeneration per 5 seconds and 0.5% of their maximum mana (or energy) per second and has 20% cooldown reduction on their abilities. If slain

As long as you hold the buff you will *never* run out of mana(Still possible but very difficult) and all your spells will have shorter cooldowns meaning that you will be able to use them more often to help you kill the jungle monsters.

---

Hoever if the champion you are useing does **NOT** use mana

*  [](/leesin) Leesin - Uses Energy
* [](/rengar) Rengar - Uses Ferocity
* [](/mundo)  Dr.Mundo- Uses Health
* [](/shyvana) Shyvana - Only restricted by Cooldowns

Then you would start at the red lizzard buff which is located 

* [Here for blue team](http://imgur.com/Z7nObFK)

* [Here for purple/red team](http://imgur.com/Ht6z7Uw)


 Killing the Lizard Elder [](/lizard) will grant you a **RED**
 buff (See below)

&gt;This unit's physical attacks apply a debuff that slows the target's movement speed by 8 / 16 / 24% (5 / 10 / 15% for ranged attacks) for 3 seconds and a DoT that deals 8 + (2 × level) bonus true damage twice. If the buff holder is slain


In other words this buff will make your Auto Attacks and spells that apply ""On-hit-effects"" Slow the target and burn them for Ture DMG. With this your ganks will be **VERY** dangerous

---
###Ganking

After you have required the desired buffs and gained the xp you wanted it is now time to gank!

But what is a gank?...

A gank is when a person goes to another lane outmanning/overpowering the enemy this person is most common the jungler. The point of the gank is to put the enemy at a disadvantage in one way or another

* Get a kill on them
* Forceing them to flash
* Make them use importent spells/items

You want to make sure that the target in question have not warded the entrence you have decided to come from as then they are ready for you and won't play agressive makeing it almost imposseble for you to gank. If you are not aware of that you are just standing in a bush wasting gold/xp as you are not doing anything. Worst case scenario would be that they kill you when you try to gank or call in thier jungler to come in from behind you.

Always remember to ping when you are about to gank so your lanes knows what you are doing so they can be ready for you
---


---
###Types of junglers

There are different types of junglers but they all have the same goal
There are:

* Ganking Jungles like [](/sejuani) 
* Farming jungles like [](/masteryi)
* Counter jungles like [](/nunu) who can quite easy steel enemy jungle monsters to deny the enemy jungler xp/gold.
* Support jungles like [](/maokai) dosen't farm jungle that great

Even though you are a farming jungler you must still gank to help your lanes.

You can also help our lanes by counter jungling as it forces the enemy team to start warding thier own jungle and puts thier jungler focus on you.

**NEVER** Counterjungle with less then 50% health!!
--- 

---
###The Dragon
Being a jungler it's also most of the time your job to secure and kill the monster dragon[](/dragon)  which gives 190gold **PER** player on your team which could realy put you ahead in terms of gold/xp.

You can find the dragon [here](http://imgur.com/o9FeQqy)

The Dragon is a realy powerfull monster so many times you would need atleast one or two other pepole 
to help you kill it somewhere in the early-mid game

You should not atempt to kill the dragon unless you have the following:

* Jungle item [](/madredsrazors)/[](/spiritstone) 

* [](/smite) - Let you secure the kill incase the enemy tries to steel it

* [](/sightward) - Protection so you can see if anyone is on thier way to try to steel the dragon/kill you

* [](/visionward) - Clear enemy wards so they don't know that you are doing it/can't see you do it

---
###Don't give up

If you are new to the jungle one is proned to get talking down  to from the team but *Don't let them discourage you* from doing it as we all got to start from somewhere and when you feel like you can't sink any deeper in the sickhole just remember that from the point you are there is only one way to go!

I'll play a game against a team with no ADC. with bruisers instead
we will have a good mid game (strong dragon control and more kills) 

now my team has 1-2 tanky bruisers (top and jungle)

they soak some damage but they cant survive all 5 and end up falling before a fully built ADC cant damage even one of them past 60/70% hp. 

The end result is a team of fully built tanks overwhelming a team with fully built ADC and APC just by sheer tankiness with minimal damage items.

I thought ADC's were supposed to be the late game carries!

1358139188.0,16j903,Why a big ELO drop can be the best thing that happens to you.,Sir_Soapy,40,4,20,"Morning All

I figured I would post this up to give everyone a bit of encouragement. Im not a great LOL player by any means. My mechanics are iffy

I started playing LOL again after what I call a 'ragebreak' of about 6 months. I hit a point where I was angry after playing a game and decided that if it makes me angry, without much practice I started into ranked.

I did pretty well to start with and got carried a bit. I found my share of trolls and bounced around and when the dust settled on my starting games I was at a reasonable, some leavers, some trolls and I started getting mad. Then, like most people, I played worse. Then I started raging.

Then I played even worse.

Then I stopped playing for a weekend and had a think about it. One that would not have happened if I had not have dropped around 400 ELO in 2 weeks. I realised that this was the best thing that could have happened. I didn’t care about winning enough that it would make me mad any more. I still get frustrated

So now I dont mind if I lose every game, if I take the opportunity to create a 'teachable moment' then the game is not a loss, its a lesson, and I have improved. The only time you can really lose in LOL is if you don’t stop and review, learn what YOU did wrong, and correct your behaviour.

If your rage and blame your team, you died, you failed to step in when you should have, you were out of position, you stepped in when you should have pulled back... there is always a reason, and barring someone chain suiciding on a tower... its not them. If you died, you made a mistake.

You are the reason you lose.  

For me, but if I'm positive and try to help I find that by the end of the game they ward better. Even if that means I start placing the wards till they get it right. Ill get frustrated when a Jungle doesn’t gank, or goes for the easy kill at a lane that is winning instead of one that is in trouble, but that is OK. Its another 'teachable moment' that I can take away and make sure I don’t do when I'm in that position.

So at the end of the day it will take a lot of games to climb back up. That is fine, and the experience that is the reason you play, not your ELO. So instead of ELO I review my games count how many mistakes I make because I know if that ever get close to 0 my ELO still wont matter, it just means I need to find new ones.

 **NEW THREAD WITH SIGNUPS AND DETAILS: http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/12416r/tasty_tournament_0_will_be_this_saturday_at_1200/**

Hi guys

I am very interested in running a tournament focused on players who can't quite compete in open tournaments like Go4LoL but still want to play in an organized and competitive setting. I've been kicking around this idea for awhile

Here is the basic run down:

Format: Best of 1

Requirements:

No member may have a highest solo queue elo at or above 1500
   
 Teams must have 5-7 members on their rosters. Rosters are locked at 12:01 am the day of the tournament.
    
 Each team must have at least one member in the tournament's IRC channel at all times. IRC will be the primary way of communicating between admins and teams.
 
Note: Players without a solo queue rating will be given a default rating of  1200


Prizes: 

Riot points prizes sponsored from Riot. In addition

Essentially, be competitive and professional, and be fun and a valuable learning experience. 

On a more logistical side

I would also like to have some/all of the games be cast. I think that is something I would want to approach after running the tournament successfully once. I think it would be great to take volunteer casters and give them a platform to practice. 

That's about it. I'm posting this here because while this would be an open tournament to the public

 What I need from you: Would you be interested in such a thing? Any feedback on the details? Thanks

Rakalakalili

Update:

This has gotten a lot of interest already, when and why. I think I may shoot for Saturday November 3rd as the first shot for the tournament. The only problem is that this may be too soon for Riot Points prizes from Riot. ",,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1351231642.0,default,

Glance at your minimap often. Map awareness is really important for mid. It will let you make plays. The reason you are mid is that you have a champion that can push a wave very fast and allow you to be elsewhere on the map. If you are staying in lane all game, expect to be camped. Mid lane is hard to gank since the turrets are so close, but if you're the only one winning lane then you are going to be the only target. Keep tabs on your enemy lanes. If your bot lane is having trouble, quickly push your lane and coordinate with your jungler to do a 4v2. If your top lane is having trouble, push your lane and head up there for a gank. Even if it's warded, you have enough time to relieve the pressure on your top lane before you miss any CS. Just like a jungler, you can directly help your teammates lane. You need to take initiative and take advantage of being close to both lanes. 

If you are duo que with your jungler, will always free up your jungler to counter jungle. The enemy jungler will usually come hold mid and not let the CS die to turrets. Also with your lane pushed, you are in position to follow your jungler into the enemy jungle to steal a buff or catch their jungler in a 2v1. 

Typically farming with an AP mid is very basic. Morganas tormented soil, you need to take advantage of that ability and help secure kills for your other lanes and jungler. 

As a mid lane, Morgana, Ahri are all very fast pushers and have some sort of very strong CC that makes for guaranteed ganks. You should be just as active as your jungler in communication.

I feel this concept is important enough for newer players to warrant being posted in the actual summoner school reddit. so if i'm out of line posting this i'm sorry :/


Hello my name is nude-fox; I main ad carry.  I’m by no means a good player, and not stressed enough when giving newer players pointers. 


What is Animation Canceling and how.

Okay now that I’ve got the awkward introduction out of the way, and you can cancel some qwer animations please let me know and then teach me how).  In general you use animation canceling after your attacks to better reposition your character before your next attack. I’ll use ashe to describe more in depth how this works. 


1.	Ashe has an attack animation. She raises her bow, and then she puts down the bow. 

2.	You can cancel her attack animation at any time immediately by giving her another command such as stop or move. 

3.	After a certain point on all champions their attack ‘registers’ with the server as having taken place. This registration point is not at the very end of the attack animation. For ashe as soon as arrow leaves her bow that attack will register with the server.

4.	Immediately after your attack has reached its registration point you can move or cancel your attack animation and your attack is still guaranteed to hit its target. 

5.	Consciously stopping part of your attack animation to reposition yourself better between auto attacks is what is commonly known as animation canceling. 

*a note on orb walking. Animation canceling and orb walking are often used interchangeably but they are technically different things. Animation canceling is a part of orb walking

.

Animation canceling and its benefits.

Why animation cancel. Well most obviously animation canceling allows you to reposition your character better. If you are being chased you can stop and attack and continue to run away much quicker with animation canceling


.

Slightly more advanced concepts/tips. 

Hokay I’m almost done but a few more random things about animation canceling that I feel are worth knowing. If you auto attack and run into a bush before your attack reaches its target you will not draw creep agro. This is pretty good for harassing bottom lane at least you can harass pop into bush and back out to last hitting immediately without worrying about getting any creep agro.  In general you can cancel the attack animations of ranged characters as soon as the projectile materializes. So for like ezrael as soon as the projectile appears you can move you don’t need to wait for it to leave ezrael’s body. An exception to this that I know of is corki. You can actually cancel corki’s attack after his projectile has left

Spirit of the Spectral Wraith is stupidly strong on Vladimir. Cooldown reduction AND spell vamp? What could go wrong? Not to mention it is insanely good for wave clear at later levels (after 2 or 3 points in E).

Another thing people forget is how much 12% increases damage really does. You might not notice it but Vlad ult can be a huge game changer. I'm expecting to see a lot more vlad with these changes. The build I take on Vlad is usually a spirit item rush in to spirit visage

This is a personal preference but I like to take full health runes and start doran's shield and a pot in some lanes. Some lanes I will take hybrid pen marks/quints with armour and a mix of flat MR and MR/lvl blues. Against heavy AD Lanes I may opt to take flat armour marks and seals.

1372827826.0,1hjs42,Tips to climb out of bronze/silver up to low golds quickly (for ADCs mainly),rhead42,44,14,71,"So, so I watched a bunch of videos and talked to some people and came up with some tricks that will let you abuse certain things about bronze and silver players and let you artificially inflate your elo/division. 

I just want to note - these things will not make you a better player, I don't think I'm a plat player - while playing against other plat/diamonds I often get crushed; which leads me to believe I'm a mid gold player at best. A lot of these I got from the leaguecraft series of videos and a rather dashing gentleman called u/seanp so kudos to those people.

1. Pick a hyper carry. Vayne is my favourite. Don't pick ez/graves/draven - because they don't have the ability to chunk through really fed bruisers (you will have to do this roughly once in every 3 games) Kogmaw would work but I am still a crappy kogmaw so I don't have much experience playing him. Tristana is good
Picking a hyper carry is risky

2. Play hyper aggressive. People are bitches at low elo. you get up in their face and 9 times out of 10 their fist instinct is to run away. Do this a couple of times and they're either dead or forced to back. Yes this means you will fuck up at first - you will get blitz hooked, stupid ways to die every single game. Eventually though you will learn how to use controlled aggression. (Dlift's razer vayne guide is a great example of controlled aggression). For the moment, if the aggression works you just win lane. Being a fed vayne at 20 minutes will inspire surrenders. 

3. Be a scumbag. Firstly
Secondly, or ace their team or get a triple/quadra kill - type a GG in all chat. Remember that people in bronze and silver are not calm, collected people - they're frustrated as hell and probably flaming their adc for feeding the vayne anyway. BM will either seriously demotivate the enemy team, or piss them off and make them tilt.  (Rarely this will not do either, but who cares you're a fed vayne)

4. Ward dragon. if your support doesn't do it, if not both. Blitzcrank is a noob magnet - you will always get matched with that sona that 'accidentally' got hooked cuz she only plays top lane and doesn't know how to play against a blitz

5. Push the lane. I still can't hit 100 cs at 10 minutes reliably. Pushing the lane means two things - first he's CSing against the tower so he's going to loose CS - at bronze and silver it means he's going to be close to something like 40 cs at 10 minutes (hopefully you'll have 60-70 at the very least). The second advantage ties into playing hyper aggressive. Your enemy laner can't do shit if he's pushed to tower all the time. You also can't get lane ganked because you'll see the jungler coming from a mile away. Pushing also lets you build up large minion waves at his tower - which means you win every trade. Even if you eat a tower shot - say you condemn him against his tower while he's last hitting, you can afford to eat the tower shot now and then. 

6. Play support. Soloq being what it is, so you'll be more understanding if she accidentally takes a few CS in lane. Playing Blitz will teach you that the hook is hard to land and can have devastating consequences if you miss it. 


That's it. These are the things I did to gain elo fast. I reiterate these will not make you a better player  - you still want to do the cs drills and improve your map awareness and learn all the matchups


Edit : For everyone saying not to play vayne at Bronze elo. I don't agree. I played vayne at low elo. She's a great duelist and punishes positioning mistakes really hard. She's a pubstomper. In my soloq career - for my first account back in october 2012 I turned 30 and started playing ranked, alistar and soraka by using these tricks. I don't think Im a plat level player - and at some point these tricks will stop working and I'll be forced to focus harder on actually improving my skills. Like I've mentioned I still can't hit perfect CS reliably - it's something I'm working on.

This makes it a better finishing move, allowing you to clean up more easily after a fight and get quick resets on your leap if you evolve wings.

So, for obvious reasons. My last evolution is usually on my ult, because that third stealth and damage reduction is just too good to pass up. When laning, I usually evolve spikes, then active camouflage, then wings. 

I would never evolve claws, I just go for maximum slipperyness. I'll take alacrity CDR boots and zephyr for movement, and the rest is just AD, Armor Pen, and a little Lifesteal in most of my games, relying on stealth, leap, and movespeed to avoid death. For this reason I will always evolve active camo and wings in 100% of my games, I'm not sure which to use. I'm thinking of evolving claws in the jungle to finish off champions more easily while ganking

***
***
***Akali***

These two changes are intended to give Akali's kit some utility. With Twilight Shroud now granting vision where it's placed, it should be a cool little trick that adds some depth to this ability.

Twilight Shroud  
Now grants vision in the area of effect  

Shadow Dance  
Essence of Shadow charge time reduced to 30/22.5/15 seconds from 35/25/15

***

***Caitlyn***

Caitlyn was crowding out a lot of other AD champions with her potent siege capabilities and strong lane trading potential. We wanted to highlight her weakness to extended trades as a sniper by reducing her base attack speed.

Additionally


Base Attack Speed reduced to 0.625 from 0.668  
Attack Speed per level increased to 4% from 3%  

Headshot  
No longer gains stacks when attacking structures
 
***

***Cassiopeia***

Twin Fang  
Now counts as a single target spell for the sake of items like Rylai's Crystal Scepter

***

***Diana***

As a melee champion

The shield change will help Diana in mid- to late-game team fights when she needs to dive into multiple enemies to engage. Before the changes

Moonsilver Blade  
Damage reduced to 20/25/30/35/40/50/60/70/80/90/105/120/135/155/175/200/225/250 (+0.6 Ability Power) from 20/25/30/40/50/65/80/95/110/125/140/155/175/195/215/240/265/290 (+0.6 Ability Power)  
Range of the cleave behind Diana reduced  

Pale Cascade  
Total damage changed to 66/102/138/174/210 from 60/105/150/195/240  
Shield reduced to 40/55/70/85/100 (+0.3 Ability Power) from 55/80/105/130/155 (+0.45 Ability Power)  
The second application of the shield now stacks with the first shield instead of replacing it  
 
***

***Elise***

Removing the bonus Armor and Magic Resist in Spider Form while increasing the ability power ratio on Skittering Frenzy will better position Elise's offensive capabilities and vulnerabilities. Elise continues to be a very strong lane bully; she will just need to think carefully about when she can win a trade.

Skittering Frenzy  
Ability Power ratio increased to 0.04 from 0.02  

Spider Form  
No longer grants bonus Armor and Magic Resist  
 
***

Passive  
Max stacks increased to 5 from 4  
Damage per stack reduced to 4/6/8/10/12 from 6/8/10/12/14

Surging Tides  
Bonus Movement Speed increased to 40 from 30  

Aqua Prison  
Stun duration increased to 1.5 seconds from 1.25  
 
***

***Nunu***

Nunu naturally fits in the jungle with his strong objective control and high map mobility – these changes should add more depth within that role. Above all

Consume  
Damage increased to 600/700/800/900/1000 from 500/600/700/800/900  
Healing reduced to 90/130/170/210/250 from 125/180/235/290/345  
Healing ratio reduced to 0.75 from 1.0  
Consume now grants bonuses for 120/150/180/210/240 seconds based on the type of monster consume was used on:

Electro-Harpoon  
Damage decreased to 45/70/95/120/145 (+0.4 Ability Power) from 55/85/115/145/175 (+0.5 Ability Power)  

***

***Syndra***

Scatter the Weak  
Improved detection of Dark Spheres at longer ranges  

***

***Twisted Fate***

With his huge global map pressure in early and mid-game, we've brought it more in line with other global ability cooldowns

Pick a Card  
Blue card now restores 50/75/100/125/150 Mana instead of 26/39/52/65/78 (+0.6 total Attack Damage)  

Stacked Deck  
No longer grants Cooldown Reduction  
Bonus Attack Speed increased to 10/15/20/25/30% from 3/6/9/12/15%

Hail of Arrows makes Varus very strong in lane trades and zoning enemies out

Base Movement Speed reduced to 330 from 335

Chain of Corruption  
Improved hit detection at the end of the missile  

***

***Warwick***

These are mostly quality of life changes for Warwick

Infinite Duress  
Channel time reduced to 1.5 seconds from 2.1 (the target is still suppressed for the full 1.8 seconds)  
Infinite Duress now always places Warwick in front of the target rather than a random spot around the target  

***

***Zac***

For all of the utility and sustain he brings

Base Health Regen reduced to 7.0 from 12.5  

Let's Bounce!  
Damage reduced to 140/210/280 from 160/240/320

Recipe changed: Faerie Charm + 120 gold = 300 total gold  
Mana Warp Passive Aura reduced to 5 Mana Regen per 5 seconds from 6  
 

***Mikael's Crucible***  

Mikael's Crucible is a very strong item for supports who want to stay on the back line out of harm's way. Most supports, which makes them adverse to buying another high-sustain item like Mikael's Crucible. These changes also open up more diversity for supports when upgrading their Philosopher's Stone - Shurelya's offers more offensive and defensive disengage, but Mikael's Crucible offers more in-fight potential.

Recipe changed: Philosopher's Stone + Chalice of Harmony + 920 gold = 2500 total cost  
Grants 7 Health Regen per 5 seconds from 0  
Grants 18 Mana Regen per 5 seconds from 9

Statue destruction algorithms tweaked to become more consistent throughout the match

Adobe AIR no longer uses the Debug Launcher and has been updated to version 3.7. This should result in increased client stability.

**The Importance of Saving Blinks/Dashes/Escapes**

What I mean by saving your blinks/dashes/escapes is that by using your blinks/dashes/escapes appropriately, will allow you to catch them and potentially kill them.

E.g. You're Katarina, Q + E + W + R, you only use Q to poke, for you know that Lee Sin will Safeguard away to safety, yet you'll still be able to ""jump"" to him with your Shunpo, so that you have the potential to kill him, with your combo. **Patience** is key here

 * This also applies to enemy champions who have some form of hard CC that may allow him/her to get away, Kassadin's Silence, etc.

**Important** - It also helps immensely if you know whether or not the enemy has his/her Flash up, if you learn to save your blinks/dashes/escapes. 

I hoped this guide helped some people. As always, or correct me if I messed up on something. Remember, if you do, you'll not only be helping me out, but be helping out with the rest of the community as well. Thanks ahead! Have a good day Summoners!",Kassadin,False,t5_2t9x3,True

Something to people between level 25-30, but have a lot to improve.

It would have rules so it doesn't get oversaturated with replays and I think it's a good way to approach players that want to get better.

1336960245.0,tlsp4,Problems I have with SNS casting,Fuzara,39,6,82,"There are some clear flaws to how the SNS events are casted

1. Who's idea was it to have more than 2 casters? I watched a majority of the matches, Caster B would do 40% of the casting, and remaining casters made up the last 10%. This is a problem. Why have someone there, if they're only going to say a handful of sentences in a match (half of which were irrelevant to the match). The reason two casters are commonly used is due to the interaction between social groups. If we look at basic human social construct, we see that two people will happily converse about a topic. Add a third, and the conversation gets disjointed and confusing, due to the different tangents people can go off on. Add a fourth, where one person is shunned, and you get ""the crowd effect""

2. Why is the ""directed camera"" function NOT being used? The directed camera function is designed to capture ALL important events in a sequential prioritization of match changing events? Countless times the cast was staring at a blank river, and champions were dying due to NOT using a function which would be far better than staring at an empty wraith camp. Use the tools you have to optimize the casting, and not miss crucial game changing events.

3. Background music. This in itself isnt a problem. The problem comes up when the casting voice program fades the music in and out when people are talking. This becomes an irritating droan of syllables and disjointed harmonies which distracts from the actual cast. Find a way to either have music at a constant volume, fix it or bin it.

4. Reverbbbbbb.....bbbbbbb.....bbbbbb. Casters sem to have some kind of reverb going on, and is quite annoying when you notice it. Again, can lose you viewers to people who get off on stephen hawkings voices. Reverb of voices, needs attention.

5. More passion. Casters need to bring something special. Sitting there talking about what is happening, thanks to koreans, passionate koreans. I'm not saying scream your face off, but you need to be original, you need to be unique, you need to bring something to the table. If you wanna get excited and throw in a PEEENNNTTTAAA KIRRRLLL, then shit be my guest, and a really cool play is made, and listening to his cackle of a laugh that follows. IF you're going to have a mountain of casters, said caster has to be very excited and voice that excitement to the audience. This allows you to have multiple casters

6. Massive delays. In the time one match finished, doing a project for work, and having my lunch, thats about 15-20 minutes of gap between games. That is significantly massive. You essentially have two options here. A) Fill in this time with prepared content or B) shorten the delays a lot. While both of these would be ideal, the first is probably the easiest. It's not hard t go and find something amusing that is LoL related, or even not LoL related. Maybe a video, or a song can play while everything is sorted out, instead of losing them.

There's my two cents on how you can improve the casting of SNS. You may like it,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,badge-kiwi,t3_tlsp4
1335497980.0,sur55,"""Tanking"" and ""Carrying""-What it means to you.",idafornian,32,4,38,"This is gonna be long

First of all let me address something that has been bothering me for some time. The metagame is what it is because people have found out that consistantly it works the best, the meta does not have to be followed. You can have 5 carries, you can have 5 tanks, or anything in between. Now lets get into some details:

**TANKS**
Ok, ""who go tank?!?"" In LoL, there are maybe 3 champs total who are pure tanks. And when I say pure tanks, I mean your classic MMO ""do no damage cc everything auras for everyone."" This is the main reason I'm writing this. Champs in League are either innately tanky or they are not. This does not mean the champs that are tanky should build tank items! Take Jarvan IV for example (mah main jungler), you can build him damage oriented and still have him be tankier than your carries, while still doing damage. In fact, many ""tanks"" build damage, Shyvanna). Instead of calling champs tanks

Building damage onto tanky players usually makes them what we like to call ""bruisers"". It is a bruisers job to get past the enemy front line to the carries, where normally every team has a bruiser top lane, in the jungle, or both.

The only ""full tanks"" in this game right now IMO are Leona, and Volibear. These are the only champs that don't really scale well with damage, and are mostly utility and thrive off of only building tank items and throwing out a shit ton of cc.

**Carrying**

So, has the potential to carry. Some champs need damage items to carry, others can build bruiser and still carry. Bruisers and AP carries usually ""carry"" early and mid game, while AD carries ""carry"" the late game, just do to the sheer damage they can put out.

One thing you have to remember, everybody says ""focus the carries"", but you can't kill them if you keep dying to bruisers. You might be thinking ""But Dom, they have SOOOOO much resistance!"" (armor/mr). Well, at this point in the game you should have a Last Whisper for armor, and a Void Staff for mr. The more armor and mr they stack when you have these, the less effective their mitigation becomes.


So just remember this when you're playing League



*EDIT* I forgot to include Rammus in the ""pure tank"" category. You could argue that Shen is in this as well,False,self,t5_2t9x3,True,,badge-caster,t3_sur55
1334349541.0,s8i1n,An analysis of champion efficiency based on your elo. (And how to climb the Elo Ladder),Xaevier,38,5,16,"X-post from [leagueoflegends Main reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/s8hcl/an_analysis_of_champion_efficiency_and_choices/)

Heya folks



I’m a 2k+ player



I see a LOT of posts from people who struggle to raise their Elo but say they are playing the right champions



What does this mean?



Well have you ever stopped to consider why champions like Shy, which is very few mistakes, high farm, low aggression.



A player can pick a farm/late game champion because they know that the enemy team is going to have few openings and rarely over-extend or put themselves in bad spots.



So this means you should learn Shy, Ashe, Karthus, Poppy, Singed and every other champion that you see played in streams right? Actually no, the champions you see streamed at high levels of solo queue and tournament level play often flat out don’t work at certain levels of the Elo ladder.


____**Let’s section off the different Elo stages so we have an idea where we stand**___



**0-1100 Elo** – Mostly trolls, dcers. A lot of games are decided based on who has the afker. Commonly called “Elo Hell” Troll saturation is 50%

**1200-1450 Elo** – People are starting to figure out how to play, watch tournaments, and generally want to get better. I would say troll saturation is about 15-30%

**1500-1800 Elo** – Players tend to have 1-2 roles they play and don’t know much beyond that

**1900-2200 Elo** – Honestly my favorite elo. Everyone can do 3-4 roles

**2200+ Elo** – This is what you see streamed, things degenerate badly as people get bored of long queues and play whatever they want and often half the players don’t care if they lose. Famous players are your worst nightmare at this point as they care the least and will just dick around the whole game. Troll saturation 30-40%

So what does all of that mean to you? Well each Elo is an entirely different game as far as what is good or bad. 



**Lets Get down to it



**0-1100 Elo** - Elo hell you have to player hyper carries who can 1v5 the enemy team and farm based champions are nearly useless since the game will often be swinging in the favor of one team by a factor of 10-30 kills by the 20 minute mark. At this point champions like Leblanc, Xin, Renekton, Graves, Vayne, Yi, Fiora, are the strongest. You have to basically never farm minions and always farm champions because if you don’t you risk your team getting killed constantly. Also you will have to learn how to 1v2 in a lane well. 

**TLDR: Gank a lot

**1200-1450:** Ok, Kassadin, Ahri or anyone else that can go between lanes and get kills is a good choice. This is because your enemies have enough intelligence to not let you kill them that easily when you are laning versus them, but they also lack the map awareness to call MIAs and watch other lanes. Thus if you teleport behind a pushing bot as Morgana….Double kills all day on CD. Champions to avoid are those who are heavy late game or have poor escapes.

**TDLR: Learn to cross lane gank

**1500-1800:**Ok so people are starting to make sure you can’t just walk from top to bot killing everything in your path just because you aren’t their “Lane enemy” and they didn’t expect you to come. I still recommend you try things like Morgana/Sion but be prepared for counter picks and it to start failing. At this point you want to gank often but you more so want to start controlling the enemy jungle, Sion will start to fall off, Renekton, Olaf, WW will beat most top lanes, Nocturne/Skarner/Mundo are good jungles as they have speed and can pressure lanes heavily (people at this point get extremely paranoid about ganks if you hit them once at level 2 or 3 and just terrorize them). Bot lane you want to stick with aggressive supports/AD and be careful about picking Ashe or Kogmaw unless you are duo queueing with your friend on support.

**TLDR: People are getting smarter, dragons, barons, and learn how to counter jungle some**

**1900-2200:** Games are won and lost based on counters. Everyone knows what beats what and it gets really tough here. The easiest way to win now is to focus on speed junglers, poppy, Fizz jungle, Jarvan top, Urgot bot, Fiora mid. Anything and everything that makes people scratch their heads (provided it works, don’t go too crazy and put Leona top or anything ridiculous) Another great thing to do is learn champions with multiple roles as they won’t feel comfortable 100% counter-picking if you pick Jarvan or Lulu (Is that a jungle jarvan or a top

**TLDR: Learn weird shit

**2200+:** Get a magic eight ball that’s going to give you a fairly accurate indicator of win or lose each game

**TLDR:** GL that’s how most players get past this (unless you’re chauster or something)

**TLDRTLDR of whole thing** Know if a champion is good against noobs or good against pros. Don’t try to force Shyvana low elo (great you counter jungled them but now you’re entire team is dying in lane because their jungler is ganking them constantly) and don’t try to force Sion at higher elo (people know how to shut him down)

Every champion has their place and you need to think about what you need to do. Early kills/early game win

Hope that helped you guys and sorry for any poor grammar or spelling. If you have any questions regarding counters

1329331587.0,pr12u,"You hear why you shouldn't rage all the time, here's a true story of why you shouldn't (featuring me)",CrAzY_MoFo_13,37,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/pr12u/you_hear_why_you_shouldnt_rage_all_the_time_heres/, you're about to see some things that make Dyrus

Anyway

Then I started to lose. Big time. The problem was that I wasn't *just* losing but I was starting to get angry while doing so. ""OH MY FUCKING GOD,"" as well as all sorts of rage-like insults, epithets, and vulgar language not suitable for the internet :P Because of this, as I lost games I got angrier, and as I got angrier I found myself *unable* to stop playing. By the end of this 1 day I had lost 11 ranked matches in a row, gone from 1422 elo to ~900, and **I actually made my mother cry because of how scarily I was behaving**. The worst part was that, wishing the most terrible things to happen to people that I didn't even know just because - I thought - they played poorly at a video game and lowered my score on an imaginary ranking system.

I'm surprised I wasn't banned; and had Riot been able to see how I was acting IRL

While this is quite extreme I will give you some of my thoughts on *why* I behaved that way. When it really came down to it, play games every day or at least schedule some time purposely to play video games) we have a very deep emotional investment in our gaming habits. Perhaps this is not on any particular one game, but we do pride ourselves in being ""good"" or ""skilled"" at *games in general*. Unfortunately, this is often the be-all and end-all of gaming: if you do not win you are a failure; **when one invests emotionally in the competitive nature of gaming one experiences a binary euphoric high when they win and a crushing depression when they lose.** This is also true with ""traditional"" sports (see: John Mcenroe).

So what happened next? Well, Minecraft, etc.); I also made a conscious decision to try and work on my gamer-rage. When I returned to LoL I abandoned ranked in all ways and attempted to just *play for fun, be courteous, and treat every game as a learning experience rather than a ladder grind.* The results? Well, at first there was nothing, but after a few months I actually started to get *better*. This seemed odd, and yet I thought

Soon enough, I just wanted games that fit the meta-mold better* (say what you want about that thought); I also decided that I would play *only* my main role of support unless forced to do otherwise (funny enough, it doesn't come up often :P). I found now that in the elo where I was raging and losing before as an AD carry I was carrying an entire team - even *4v5* - as support, something I was told by even 2000k pros was impossible below 1300 elo. So how did I do it? Well, first I played my role to a ""t"": warding right, counter-warding, keeping my carry healthy and farmed, I was sort of an unofficial ""team captain"", etc. While not everyone would listen to me, would follow that plan (they usually were).

Now, and organized the Sunday Night Scrim Series where I sometimes play with 1600+ elo people at a level that, I think, is at least somewhat in the ballpark of their skill (at least if I play support :P). I do occasionally rage at video games but those examples are much less than previous and I tend to catch myself before I get out of control. Recently (i.e. today) I played a match though that tested my patience. Essentially, I was playing support Nautilus to my carry Tristana; though this Tristana was relatively skilled with her character there was some miscommunication that resulted in my taking firstblood and Tristana being unable to get a kill because of no co-ordination (essentially, no VOIP). In addition, it was only my second game as Nautilus so I was still getting used to his skillset. Anyway, ""You're fucking terrible, etc. etc. etc. The funny thing was that we were winning our lane quite easily against an (AP) TF and Soraka (in general, some great teamfights for me and some good calls kind of made it hard for her to insult me further and by the end of the game we won with a score of [this](http://i.imgur.com/ElkyW.jpg).

1375992561.0,1jz8h5,Lets share some tips!,Oliverious,37,9,22,"Hi everyone

Playing as rengar
playing as nidalee, this way you will amplify the dmg of the spear.

You can say THAT a lux is a good lux when she lands a good combo (Q/E at the same time, AA to proc passive again)

As j4 you can use twice the same flag to do the combo! for example, and then use your Q to go back to the first wall! juke every one!

When you play as tryndamere

Renek does not need to stop running when he uses his Q, so if you activate hydras WHYLE you press your Q, he will do both dmgs. and dont stop running!

A great way to gank as xin is to use your E not in the enemy champ, slow him and push him back to your partners.

AS voli: The aoe from his slow is higher than the range of his AA... so you can use it to chase someone when you activated your Q

When you ult someone as skarner you can use your Q for dps and stack it!

playing as thresh, banshees veil, even when gp eats an orange) you still can use your Q on them, it wont do any dmg and wont supress them, but you can use it to go to them!!

Tristana's ult is NOT single target! it will dmg only one

as thresh, and he will end up being with you!

This was originally posted on leaguemeta (whrong!) and i allready had some tips from some people there!:

Oliverious sed:

As singed you can hide your poison! when someone is chasing you, you can AA your target while the animation of the flint! that will add some nice dps! when playing nocturne, remember to try to remain on the shadow of your Q !! it will give you a really nice ad buf!

laserbastu sed:

As Draven

Albaek sed:

A general tip to those with target abilities against enemies with shields. For example

When you use Q on someone outside your range you ""light up"" in a way. You may not always notice it as such, he's gonna shard when he comes in range"" and shield up, but the thing is you also highlight if you auto attack him. Now, Malphite is a melee champion, so if you auto attack him outside Q range, then get in Q range they will often shield into nothing. Then after the shield wears off you can throw in a shard.

* Aatrox is a melee champion who seems to rely on autoattacks to deal most of his damage. Especially the third hit from his blood price ability. To that end, he does mostly physical damage, so the armor is going to benefit as well. If it's appropriate to your champion's build paths, consider grabbing a warden's mail early on in lane.

* The champion spotlight makes a big deal of his durability, he's actually a fair target to be burst down early in a fight. If you can kill him before he can charge his blood well, then you'll have a much easier time killing him the second time. Additionally, if you burst him straight up, his op lifesteal/sustain won't matter. Of course, he'll likely build some health to counter this, but it's worth considering.

* Likewise, who want to all-in him all the time, his advantages will be less relevant. Again, try to hit him the second he comes (back) into lane, because his blood well won't have anything to heal him with.

* Additionally, or Morellonomicon can all shut down his healing. I can't be certain, but I'd imagine that if you can plug him with a grievous wounds debuff before his blood well activates, you can cut the amount of health he revives with in half.

* And lastly, if you CC him, he can't do things. Although again, given that his sustain is dependent on doing things, it's actually slightly more relevant here.",Aatrox,False,t5_2t9x3,True

1367659116.0,1do6dx,Teamfighting as Kha'Zix,PhrostCode,32,3,55,"So recently I started playing Kha'Zix top and I absolutely love him. I know how to play him during the laning phase. Although I absolutely do not know how to teamfight as Kha'Zix or any assassin to that. Previously I've only played adc/support and I'm trying to learn more roles so I decided to play Kha'Zix since he seems so fun.

I know that prior to a teamfight I'm supposed to dish out ash much damage as I can to targets with my W. Although once the fight starts I have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to do. I know I'm supposed to kill squishy targets and use resets on my leap to escape or continue the fight. Although every time I try I get blown up or fail to kill the squishy targets quickly enough(I may get them to about 1/3 health but I can't finish the job).

My build on him was roughly(this roughly the items I have when I get blown up in teamfights. This is not a finished build):

Muramana/Manamune, BT, Giants belt(should I upgrade to warmogs earlier?).

Do I need to build more defensive items? Also now that I think about it I was always within leap range of an ADC during the teamfight so I do recall using leap to jump straight onto the ADC. Should I be using my ult to just walk past everyone to the back lines?

**Overall I'd just love some tips on how to play him.** Maybe some mechanics that'll help my laning phase. But I'd just prefer someone teaching me how to teamfight as Kha.

Also what's your opinion on your 3rd evolution? Should I evolve his ULT or Q? I know his Q would be helpful in killing squishy targets. I'm not too familiar with his ULT so I haven't been evolving it much but recently I feel like I'm getting the hang of it and have used it in 1v1 situations to come out on top.

1363529235.0,1agpen,Tips for Success: Splitpushing - The How and When,MarcAurelius,36,9,11,"Hey guys, and what champions can splitpush

Anyways, you're all welcome to comment on this guide if I missed anything and add that it, or if you'd like for me to write about something else for the next ""Tips for Success"" you can PM me here on Reddit. Thanks ahead guys

**Splitpushing Fundamentals**

**What is Splitpushing?**

Splitpushing is the act of having a champion go ""push"" another lane down, i.e. Dragon, Baron, buffs, teamfighting, etc. 

 * This is generally done after the ""laning"" phase in which teams are usually grouping up for objectives or teamfights.

**The effects of Splitpushing**

**Benefits for your team**

 * May give your team a turret advantage

 * This ^ opens up opportunities for your team to ""take"" other objectives w/o much contesting from the enemy team. 

 * Since you may get a tower out of splitpushing

 * May force the enemy team to send one of their teammates to go ""deal"" with you making it a 4v4 for your team, etc.) give your team an advantage. 

**When to Splitpush**

Although very situational

 * Your team and the enemy team are just ""hovering"" and not doing anything except ""exchanging"" waves of CS, take out the CS waves that come up to it.

 * Your team is pushing another lane and the enemy team is coming to ""intercept"" them

 * If you and your team have ""killed off"" the usual enemy laner that would be sent to ""stop"" your splitpushing (generally their Top Lane

 * If you're playing a champion that is able to get into teamfights really quickly, Shen ult, Boots of Mobility, etc., or are able to contribute to teamfights w/o having to be in the fight itself, e.g. Gangplank ult, Karthus ult

 * If you're playing a champion that is excessively ""slippery"" due to his/her kit, Katarina, etc.

 * Are playing a champion that is able to clear CS waves extremely quickly, etc.

**How to Splitpush** 

If you meet some of the criteria above then you essentially:

 * Clear CS waves with you AAs and kit as quickly as possible to ""push"" the lane and potentially take a tower.

 * Be sure to be **very** map aware

 * Know when to ""back off"" e.g. You ""spidey-sense"" that you're gonna die if you take the next CS wave

 * Know your DMG Splitpushing potential, Sunfire Cape, Lich Bane, etc.

1361471157.0,18yttl,Lane Advantage &amp; How to Make Use of it (Lengthy read),PSL8,39,9,12,"Hi /r/summonerschool, Silver Season 2

I have included little TL;DRs at the bottom of each section for those who want to skim.
 


&gt;**Situation 1: You get First Blood against your lane opponent

* First of all, i.e. all summoners are blown and you are 1 level ahead of your lane opponent. Most players  in this situation would think that the lane is effectively over (in your favor); HOWEVER, you should take into consideration the following:

1. Both summoners are down
2. The enemy jungler is going to gank
3. Your ward at level 1 (which I assume you bought) has expired
4. First blood is 400 gold, cloth armor, etc. While this is indeed a big advantage in early game, it is not indicative of your lane being won.

* Remember that death timers are very short in the early levels. If your minion wave is not pushed hard enough

* What should your first buy be? WARD. Any other item is completely up to you

* Should you play aggressive or passively farm up your advantage? Keep in mind, you must take into consideration the enemy champion and his/her abilities to trade. Some champions are better than others in the early game and have the ability to kill the other even if they are a level behind. Champions like Xin Zhao and Udyr have AMAZING level 2 burst damage and will almost always be able to out-trade you. Most of the time it comes down to ward coverage and map awareness. Knowing where the enemy jungler is and capitalizing on it by going aggressive on your lane opponent.

* TL;DR - FB Advantage is nice, passively farm up to further increase your lead. Don't get too cocky. If you attempt another all-in, there is always a chance of you losing the trade because you decided to tank a full minion wave's worth of damage or take a free tower hit. Play SMART.

&gt;**Situation 2 (The one that really matters): ""I'm 6-0 in lane but my team is feeding GG can't win

* Annoying, Gold (especially), and sometimes Plat (unfortunately) games, the fed player will start cussing their teammate out, further demoralizing them and making them feel worse about their mistakes. Sometimes, it really isn't your teammates' fault they got outplayed or got countered in lane. Shit happens, and YOU can make it better. Here's how!

* Keep a **positive** attitude. I cannot stress this enough. I have been in both positions. When I am the one getting outplayed in lane and going 0-3 in the first 10 minutes, but I told them that I would try my best to farm and do my job in teamfights, which is to assassinate their ADC. Lo and behold, when teamfights started, I was able to 1 shot their ADC because I tried my best to farm up. I ended up beating my opponent in lane in CS score. We won teamfight after teamfight, with me complimenting my teammates' good play. Saying things like ""nice ult"" or ""good stun"" at the end of a fight is what all players should do. I kept telling my team that we would win this game. Guess what? We won and I ended up with a much better score than their top laner. Our jungler ended up apologizing for his early behaviour, stating that he had a bad day and he should never have cussed me out before the game was officially over. **TL;DR - Stay positive, encourage them to farm up and play safe. Don't add to the shit that they are already dealing with.**

&gt;**Alright

1. Ward up. Keep both sides of the river warded. Good ward spots for mid lane are the enemy wraiths and the ""banana"" brush near the blue golem camp (the one closest to lane). 

2. ROAM. You have a huge advantage over your lane opponent and he/she is no longer worth much gold, don't go bot UNLESS you are planning a full dive with your jungler. Look to roam top, instead. **IF** you want to gank bot and you are at base, look to gank through LANE. Chances are, the enemy team won't expect a lane gank from the the mid laner. 

3. ROAM Pt. 2 - When you roam, do whatever you need to in order to let them know. Once you are there and the action is starting, give the kills to your AD carry IF POSSIBLE. You are already 6-0 (or whatever), it is actually better if your AD got the gold. If you get a kill or two, look towards global objectives if you and your teammates are healthy enough. Dragon or bot tower, both are good. 

4. Taking down mid tower. When ganking bot is not feasible and assuming you still have a big lead over your lane opponent

5. **Keep ganking bot**. It is a good idea to maintain the pressure that you are giving. Keep up the strong map presence. Consecutive ganks that are successful will not only help your bot lane catch up

6. Counterganks. If you plan on going bot again, go for it. If not, tell your team to back off and you should continue to push mid tower to draw the jungler away from counterganking bot. 

7. **Teamfights**! You are at the teamfighting phase of the game

TL;DR - Ward


Apologies for the wall of text but I hope I helped clear some things up. Moral of the story - always buy wards and help out the other lanes. And most importantly

1352765035.0,133c25,Tips for people who want to learn ADC from /r/leaguoflegends,Poshillius,32,2,10,"Here is a post that's up on /r/leagueoflegends

""ADC player here. Been playing for a few years. Have had a handful of accounts here and there. There are some definite tips that I feel like people playing ADC need to know that will improve their general gameplay mechanics as ADC.

First let me start by saying this: ADC is high risk - high reward. There is no other feeling like getting a quadra or penta in a team fight. At the same time, you will be CC helled in team fights, you will be first priority target to kill late game, and you will be the focus of attention laning phase if you start to get too big. ADC is hard as shit to pull off successfully - don't let the guys like Doublelift or ChaoX distort the reality of the lane.

1) In early laning phase, oh well I have wards and the jungler won't get me. Think again. Not only can a strong jungler like Maokai, Nocturne, or Shen still get to you - if you push the lane against an ADC like me, I will keep it in front of my turret ALL DAY. You instantly get a disadvantage by pushing the lane as you are more susceptible to lane ganks. Use your harass wisely. I generally do NOT harass until I get my first set of items which include my tier 2 boots. Now this is not always an accepted fact - there are moments when you CAN harass early game and get away with it although you need to weigh the pros and cons of every situation game by game. If the enemy jungler is getting shit on by your team, it might be a good idea to push your lane.

2) RELAX RELAX RELAX. I see a lot of ADC freak out when they miss a few CS. ITS OK. BREATHE. You are NOT doublelift and you will not perform up to his CS standards. All people who play ADC have an advantage they naturally bring to the characters. Doublelift is CS god - he hardly misses CS, has godlike positioning. They are both great players. Do not freak out when you miss a few minions in a row as it will snowball down a shitty path.

3) The best thing to do when attempting to CS is predict when a minion will be LOW ENOUGH to CS. Let me explain more clearly: when I see a minion is about to die I naturally start a quick timer in my head that will go down to 0. At 0, is the jungler coming, where is my support, how is my mana, etc. While doing this I naturally get the minion just in time because I have my mind timer down to know exactly when to CS. A lot of enemy ADC I play against just simply take harass when they are CS'ing because they focus on one minion at a time. Learn to CS while getting having awareness of the entire lane. This takes an incredible amount of time but it is well worth it to learn how to be map aware while CSing.

4) Never ever ever never ever rely on your support to do anything for you. You must learn to play the role of ADC as if it is 2v1. If you rely on solo que supports you will fail. This is just how the game works, flash, pull, stasis, chase, ward, etc with no result. Learn to play independently and wisely. Pick and choose your battles. I am not putting down support as I believe it is a very important role for the team as a whole - I am simply saying if you are playing with a support that is not on skype with you and you do not have a general bot lane relationship

5) Edit your keyboard configuration to your liking. You do not need to use the default config

6) This point coincides with 5 a little bit. Attack moving is a required mechanical skill if you plan on advancing over your current hurdle. You must learn to use your keyboard to your advantage on this. Simply using your mouse to click on the enemy char, click away, WILL FAIL. You might have some success but in the long run this mechanic is inefficient as it is prone to misclicking. I personally switch my A button (attack move) to my space bar as I believe my thumb is generally unused in my gameplay. This way I don't have to sacrifice my normal hand positioning that I am so accustomed to using. Using this keyboard config, I can use my space bar and right click to get away and auto attack the nearest champion chasing me. I cannot tell you how many people I have kited or straight up killed using this mechanic. It becomes easier as you get a phantom dancer as it allows you great mobility.

7) Understand the ROLE of ADC is simply DPS. Straight - raw - damage. When you play in the upper levels, I will rush after him.

8) Positioning is K E Y. Get into position BEFORE initiating your fights. Are you somewhat in the front line? Take a second or two to get in the back before starting to initiate. Do not go ballsack YOLO 420 swag and dps whatever is in front of you without realizing your position. Get in the back then lay down the pain. Almost all of your deaths will happen because you are out of position and easy to get to.

9) Do NOT worry about burning flash too early. Better to burn it too early then to get exhausted and die. This principle also applies to HEAL especially if the enemy has an ignite. As ADC you are not afforded extra seconds of life tanky champs are. Use your summoners generously but wisely. Ezreal about to ult your face off? Flash is ok. Soraka about to banana you? Flash not ok. I see a lot of people save their flashes for the very very last second and it is not wise as an exhaust will almost always counter a flash if you have bad positioning. Finding that grey area of when it is useful to flash and when it is not comes from experience. You will learn how to use it effectively.

10) If you have a champion with quick escape mechanisms, save your quick shift to help get away unless you are certain you will win the exchange.

11) You can buy wards TOO you know! Do not rely on your support to place proper wards. I cannot stress how many times I have played against a Blitzcrank and my support never wards the lane brush. As ADC you might need vision on certain areas that your support does not know about or cannot do in time. I have gotten a ton of kills by warding a brush of a champion I am chasing to get that final shot in. Always carry at least 1 ward when you return to lane - it will help the overall team and could secure you a kill.

These are just some tips. I hope they have been useful to you guys. Please feel free to add more! I also hope to hear from other ADC players on their advice. GOOD LUCK!""

1343172437.0,x3n1m,Improve your game by taking 2 minutes to reflect on how to improve after each game.,SourSkittlez,37,8,22,"Hey Summoner School

I just wanted to share something I have been working on and how it has improve my gameplay tremendously in the an extremely short time.  Just a little back story on how and why I created what I did.  I originally created an excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the champions, I usually made a spur of the moment decision and bought a champion that I regretted later on.  By keeping track of which champions I owned and which ones I've had my eye on for a while, this led to smarter purchases with my IP.  This allowed me to see a simple view of all the champions I owned and how much I needed to buy the ones I wanted.

Fast forward a couple months and I think to myself that I should start adding on to my spreadsheet and start tracking my games.  I then stumble upon this post [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uel9r/excel_game_tracking_sheet_version_2/).  The spreadsheet that ebilgenius created was EXACTLY what I wanted to start tracking so I decided to try it out, try ganking top more to help"".  Just the act of writing these small comments down helps keep them in my mind when I play my next game and have noticed a significant improvement in my play (just look at my games starting 7/20/2012 as proof).  

I've left a link to the spreadsheet that I created.  I'll give a quick rundown on how to use it if you are willing to try.

1. If a new champion comes out
1. After playing a game
1. After clicking the button
1. Try to put something constructive in the ""Things to Improve"" box on how **YOU** can improve
1. Hit the ""Save"" button (the ""Save"" button in the form
1. The data will be added to the spreadsheet and will be color coded whether you won or lost.
1. A quick summary of your stats will be displayed on the right side of the ""Main"" tab showing your stats for various roles and lanes you have played.
1. For a more detailed summary

**Note** I have a couple ""placeholder"" games in my ""Main"" tab in order to get rid of some errors.  You can choose to create placeholder games or simply delete them, then the ""Overall Win Ratio"" will be lower).

**Note 2** You must enable macros to use my spreadsheet (don't worry

Feel free to ask me any questions/comments or if you want me to add any features to the spreadsheet if you are planning to use it.  I already have a couple ideas on what to add to it, lanes and how much you are improving based off of wins/time).

Get the spreadsheet [HERE](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bygenmvm7j4LaHdZVWF1U3JOUVk) (EDITED: uploaded a blank spreadsheet with placeholders instead of uploading my personal one with my stats)

**EDIT** [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/a28sl.png) is a screenshot to show how much I've improved in such a short amount of time.

1) Knowing you have a weakness

The first step to getting better at any game is knowing that there are things to be improved, but that's okay.

2) Experience

Okay so you have 150 wins under your belt

So sometimes, if you're reading guides like this, your already ahead of the curve. After around 250  wins, its safe to say you have a good amount of experience and game knowledge. You'll still have stuff to learn but you'll know a lot.

3) Arrogance

This is the sole reason ""Elo Hell"" (if there is one) exists. There are a bunch of players who think they play on a pro level but are only being held back by their teammates. This kind of feeds back into step 1 but its kind of a different monster. These guys believe they're the next chaox and are quicker to believe that everyone around him is terrible (both teammates and opponents) and that's the only thing holding him back.

If you're stuck at 800 Elo (or any elo for that matter), maybe you have a problem last hitting, maybe you don't go for objectives enough, maybe you just dont communicate with your team well enough. But somewhere in there, there's some kind of mechanical or logical failure in your play. Look over your play carefully to see if there's something that can be improved for next time or have a more experienced friend look it over with you.

4) Attitude

This ones simple. Sometimes people don't approach the game with the right state of mind and it causes their play to suffer. It's either "" I'm so bad at this game. I'll never get better. What's the point of playing anymore?"" or ""I'm so f*cking pissed off! Why did those noobs feed last game! I hate noobs"" or "" i had such a bad day... I'm so frustrated. Lemme play a game or two of league. I'll feel better after i win""

None of these are right. The goal of the game is to have fun right? So when you log on, make sure your ready.

5) Stagnation

The advancement in your play can start to stall if you stop experimenting and trying new things. Try a new role, try something you've never seen before or something no one else has thought of. Being able to think outside of the box and find something that suits you best can take a great leap to improve your play. This game is full of possibilities, never stop experimenting.

6) Specialization

No one's good at everything. Even the pros. They have one or two roles they're really good at with a variety of champions to fill them and everything else they play decent enough to not hurt the team overall. But getting that 1 or 2 roles down to the best of your abilities is what will allow you to reach one of the highest plateaus in the game.

7)Striving for perfection

This is what separates the good players from the pros. Being able to comb out every little kink in your play so that mistakes are rare or just don't happen altogether. Honestly

I apologize for the length and yeah it's a bit sappy at times but i hope people can absorb these points to help themselves improve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Feel free to disagree with anything i've said here. I am by no means a pro and i dont think i know everything there is about this game. I'm actually in the learning process of playing starcraft 2 at a level i feel that i can play this game on. I need to follow a couple of these progressing through both league and SC 2 as well.

But I digress. Thanks for reading and good luck to everyone looking to improve. PM me or comment if you have questions.",self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/uwjoq/not_getting_any_better_read_this/

1338567042.0,ufrsi,League of Legends Noob Academy: Why Mages Go Mid,Sanman_,35,4,16,"Hello summoners!

I write a few weekly columns for a website called RTSguru.com, called ""League of Legends Noob Academy.""  I got the idea after explaining, in painful detail, many aspects of the game to a friend of mine who has been playing League for quite some time, and it hit me that much of the knowledge us regular players take for granted isn't that obvious to new players, even with hundreds of games under their belt!  I'll link the piece (which has a few pictures and a warding map) and try to c/p it here without slaughtering the formatting.

**League of Legends Noob Academy: Why Mages Go Mid**

&gt;For many of us the more primitive and base knowledge on how League of Legends operates is common sense, self-evident. Today we start a series aimed at newer players, to give them some background and explanation about why things are the way they are in League of Legends. We start with the middle lane, and why mages love it so!

It occurred to me as I gently berated my friend the other night that not all players understand why certain things are the way they are in the League of Legends world.  After over an hour of discussion and explanation about why each archetype goes in which lane and how it is the most efficient way to play it dawned me that many players simply take lane set-ups and metagame-inspired strategies for granted.  So today we’ll be sharing the first of many “Noob Academy” articles with the intent of educating newer players about the macro strategy of League of Legends.

Before we begin, contrary, it is simply to address those whom I hope to edify.  We all start off as noobs and we all learn at different paces while garnering different attitudes towards learning.  Furthermore this piece isn’t necessarily aimed at brand new players, as my friend has played hundreds of games of League and still didn’t understand these finer, somewhat obscure points.  Fresh players should simply focus on playing the game and learning how things work, advanced tactics and stratagems have no place there.  No, this is for those of you who have ever wondered “why can’t the AD carry go mid

On to the topic then!  Why do mages go to middle lane?

**The Benefits and Shortcomings of Middle Lane**

The first thing to examine when considering why any archetype should go where is the benefits of going to said lane, not to mention being equidistant from both top and bottom lane.  Also mid lane is the closest lane to the fountain, thus making return trips and hiking back doesn’t take quite as long as in the other lanes!  Lastly the distance from the middle of the lane to one’s own tower is sufficiently shorter than the comparable distance in other lanes, making escaping ganks a somewhat easier affair.

Obviously though there are some disadvantages to going mid lane as well.  While it supplies wonderful access to a plethora of locations and objectives it is also the lane which is most susceptible to ganks.  In total there are six causeways enemies and allies can use to enter the lane from the river area not to mention the back two entrances behind the tier one tower, it is still imperfect compared to even one ward in the other lanes.

**Why Mages Fit In Middle Lane Perfectly**

First and foremost mages, who value gold more so than levels, a mage with no items and level six is a terror into him or herself.  Most mages become killing machines when they ding level six (many before that even) and the only way to deal with a mage and their burst power in said lane is to, funny enough, throw the same thing back at them!  Sure enough there are some defense-oriented champions who can flourish in mid lane (such as Galio and Ryze) and a few extremely powerful early game champions (such as Pantheon and Talon) but the general rule-of-thumb is to put a mage mid who can outplay the enemy mage and snowball the early and midgame a bit in your team’s favor.

Branching from their desire for and power from levels mages can use the positional advantage mid lane grants them to project power across the rest of the map.  Coordinating a buff steal or skirmish with one’s jungle is an easy affair given the copious amounts of entrances the mid lane grants to both jungles.  Likewise mages grant both teams a powerful asset in Dragon fights compared to any other archetype that would take over the lane, or both.  

On the other hand mages have a multitude of tools to cope with mid lane’s shortcomings.  While it is an extremely disadvantageous location for escaping ganks many mages have the crowd control or mobility to juke out of a gank or escape back to the turret safely.  Many classes don’t have the raw mobility to address this problem and considering how easy it is to camp mid lane, and possible warding locations, mages fit the bill quite nicely.  

**What About The Old “Ranged Carry Mid” Strategy?**

This old playstyle grew out of a desire to give carry players the most gold as possible because, most of the time, mid lane was the only solo lane, not because ranged carries are well suited for the shenanigans that go on in the mid lane.  Most carries don’t have extreme mobility or burst and lack sufficient power to duel in the beginning stages of the game, and a few well-coordinated ganks set them back much further than any other archetype.  A carry lives and dies by their gold gain, hence this old tactic.

There were a few  problems with this though!  If one thinks “just put them top solo when junglers started becoming  a mainstay of play” then think again, so bottom lane wasn’t terribly attractive until the playerbase started taking the 0cs support idea seriously and eventually take it for granted that it will be done in every game.  Compound all of these factors with the reality that mages started going middle (largely in response to carries being mid, and the fact that mages absolutely wreck carries in lane) and it will be profusely evident that the era of “carries mid” is over for a good reason.

*Now

**Conclusion**

At the end of the day the mage and middle lane fit together like a hand and its glove.  With careful play and a bit of knowledge any clever player can take a mobile mage mid and hold their own with the best of them

1331086240.0,ql2mj,A hint to generally getting better at LoL,jakepasanen,38,7,21,"Hey all.

I'm low ELO.  Currently sitting around 950.  However

So here's what I did to get better:

**Play support.**

When you play support, buying wards, etc.  Luckily, these habits aren't something that just switches off if you play a game as AD or mid or jungler.

I played solely support for a period of about two weeks.  Over the course of this time, when ganks are probably coming, your map awareness is far better... I'm actually amazed at my own progress (not to sound arrogant, sorry.  Like I said, I'm still in triple digit ELO).  You also find yourself finding ways to cover for your teammates mistakes, again because of playing support.

Also, and it got me killed a lot.  During my support stint, I started to notice people doing similar things and started doing things like telling them my heal CDs so that they knew when they could run in and such.

So, just condensing it and giving you a way to practice it.  So if decide to take my advice, go out, pick up Soraka, play her in a bunch of normals (or solo queue if you want).

And I don't know if this would even go for everyone

I also have questions about how to maximize my damage.

* I understand my W gives better damage on my spell casts

* Does my Q do more damage based on *chargeup time* or *range*? Basically, should I fully charge my Q before hitting them? Or can I just quick-fire it for the same damage? (we're talking melee-range ish)

* Let's say I have a Thresh as support. He lands a good hook on their ADC, then E, then Q? Do you auto, E, auto, Q?

1366777362.0,1czn1p,Is it safe to say I'm never leaving bronze?,theappleiwarlock,38,9,73,"I'm probably writing this post mainly out of anger/frustration

S2 I probably jumped in ranked too soon after I hit 30 but I still ended up around 1350-1400 elo. And I spent the off season learning more, etc. Fast forward to S3. Time for some placement matches. I honestly tried to support my way through placement and well, after losing 5 that I can directly link to trolls and then some I was in bronze V. So I then thought ""hey maybe I should be the one doing damage instead of buying wards all the time."" So I tried to main adc for a while and ended up working up to bronze II. Then the usual bronze suspects showed up and after numerous games of trolls and/or people that are 0-8 by 20mins, I was back in bronze III. This pattern has repeated itself about 4 times now. I get promoted to II win a game or two then have numerous bad teammates (intentional or not) and wind up demoted back to III. Not to mention the numerous times I've had to try to get through because of, well you guessed it, trolls or the 0-8's.

Lately I got the idea that maybe I could influence games more by jungling or playing a lane that can roam easier like top. I've really started to love to play Elise or Kha'zix. But all my games seem hit or miss. Either my team does decently well and helping them gank their lanes is easy. Or every lane loses and I get caught trying to peel off the adc so maybe we can turn a fight around and gain some ground. Maybe it's just bad luck or maybe I should go back to adc but either way I've found myself on a losing skid that has me on the verge of being demoted to bronze IV.

I'm not trying to blame all my problems on my teams. Everyone has bad games from me to Evil Geniuses, one person cannot win a team game on their own. They certainly can help influence the outcome, but they cannot straight up win it on their own. The current tier system seems to only account for wins/losses in determining if you move up or down and by how much. And for someone like me who almost always win their lane, this bugs the crap out of me. You can have unlucky placement and get stuck where you shouldn't be (maybe this was me) or you can have a lucky streak or get carried and get stuck where you shouldn't be (I wish this was me). Having an unlucky streak can also seriously harm you in trying to progress. I honestly kind of prefer the old elo system because of this.

I'm now over 200 games in bronze. Based on my understanding of the tier system

Please refrain from the usual ""stay positive"" or ""you have to carry the team on your back through mud and fire"" type of comments. I can honestly say I never rage and try my hardest to stay positive through every match. I've also already said my two cents on carrying in this game.

TL:DR; S2 around 1400 elo. Stuck in bronze

**EDIT** Wow I'm honestly overwhelmed by the number of responses. Some of you have offered some great advice. So perhaps not all is lost and I should just keep on fighting soloq. I will try to get a stream or some replays up soon. If anyone wants to duo (NA) scrim,False,self,t5_2t9x3,1366817038.0,,,t3_1czn1p

1363591758.0,1aihuz,Advice on watching friendly minion health,Tuchit,37,6,14,"The fact that you have to constantly watch enemy minion health in order to last hit is indisputable. A lot of players, if not just as important.

Watching your friendly minions' health bars allows you to predict the future. I mean, and you notice a caster minion getting low. Malzahar is going to come in to last hit that minion. You know this before he moves at all because you know that's what any reasonable player would do, assuming he feels safe doing it. **Capitalize on this fact.** Wait for Malzahar to set up for an auto attack, and right when he stops to start the animation, throw your Pillar of Flame right on top of him. There goes a huge chunk of his health all because he just wanted that gold. Repeat this a couple of times and he'll be low. Enter zoning. This is the point where he'll either have to run back to base licking his wounds or risk getting hit by an E - Q - W - AA combo, killing him instantly. With melee opponents this is like shooting fish in a barrel.

Or hey, throw your E down. He'll either have to abandon the lasthit or take your E. Throw a couple of seeds on top of him with a Q for a very frustrated Draven.

But wait, and your opponent is last hitting normally, the wave is likely to push towards his tower. If his minions have more health than yours, the lane is likely to push towards your tower. You can tell your jungler to come soon because he's going to be exposed to a gank. If you want to take this to the next level, check your lanes as jungler. Not only the number of minions but also their health bars matter here.

Ganking a lane? Wait until the opponent is going in for a last hit on a caster minion and jump him. It will be the perfect opportunity because the few in-game feet that he has to run can make the difference between a successful gank and an unsuccessful one. Obviously if he's already super pushed this isn't necessary

1346832737.0,zduj7,Banning Strategies,Kienan,33,2,13,"Hello

I haven't been spending as much time here as I should, it's actually fairly basic, but I thought I'd write it out. As I said, I've seen many people not taking advantage of this.

Simply put

Let's say you're first pick/ban, Shen, Malphite, and the dreaded cow. Now, you could simply ban them all yourself, and that's a valid choice. However, you can get 'free' bans if you make your opponents ban some of these. So, ban a slightly less popular champ like Darius, ban someone else you don't like

As long as they continue to ban your bans for you, giving you three free bans. If they leave someone open, first pick them, or ban them if no one plays that champ.

How does this work if you're second pick? Well, or risk leaving someone open for first pick. If they open up with a Shen ban, for instance, you get another free ban. If they keep banning the common bans, you still get free bans, even though you're second pick. Just remember to ban people you really don't want to see, but give your opposing captain a chance to ban it *first*. If they first ban Shen, or whoever. If they second ban anyone but Malphite/Alistar (again, so go ahead. They could still third ban the other

**TL;DR: Don't think of the banning phase as some cooperative 'let's work together to ban OP champs' pansy shit. Bans are a competitive mini-game, Y, or Z, *you* ban them, sucker!' Second pick is similar, but you need to wait for your opponent to 'waste' a ban on commonly banned champs.**",,self,default,

1341958435.0,wco9b,Immadrood's Item Guide (What the fuck do these items do?),Immadrood,33,5,52,"`So I finally want people to understand what each item's situation witholds and the specifics behind buying those said items. Here's my massive guide. 

TL;DR Buy Sight Wards

EDIT: AFTER CONSUMABLES IM GOING TO MAKE THE ITEMS IN ORDER RATHER THAN IN SECTIONS

**Consumables**

Granted this situation is silly to add in

[](/healthpotion ""Health Potion"") - These give you sustain in lane (10 HP per second) and can help you win certain skirmishes in lane. Start these in most lanes and most ALL matchups for mobility and sustain.

[](/manapotion ""Mana Potion"") - Noone gives a fuck about these anymore

[](/sightward ""Sight Ward"") - Buy these

[](/visionward ""Vision Ward"") - Buy these to take out enemy sight wards and to easier take control of objectives with lack of oracles. Also good for baron control when the enemy wants to ward and you can keep taking them out with your vision. Good vs stealth's as well.

[](/oracleselixir ""Oracles Elixir"") - So this will obviously help you kill wards and assist in the killing of invisible units

[](/elixiroffortitude ""Elixir of Fortitude"") - This elixir specifically can help you negate ignite damage since passive HP gain does not factor in with the healing reduction cost. This is an amazing bait tool for top and potentially bot lane on an AD carry. Elixirs and general are bought for forcing baron so that you are just the little bit stronger. Ad's should focus on the [](/elixiroffortitude ""Elixir of Fortitude"") since it gives HP and AD

**Boots**

[](/berserkersgreaves ""Berserker's Greaves"") A good item for champions that rely on their auto attacks heavily and specifically is the priority AD carry item. In some cases champions like [](/Irelia ""Irelia"") can buy these boots since she has the CC reduction passive and dosent need tenacity

[](/ninjatabi ""Ninja Tabi"") A great item for champions that want to counter AD. Specifically junglers like [](/drmundo ""Dr. Mundo"") Can get an early ninja tabi so he can DRAGON at level 6 without fear. Also the 10% damage reduction is pretty crazy versus some forms of burst

[](/mercurystreads ""Mercury's Treads"") Best boots in the game. PERIOD. ._. ""What you mean to say is that Mercury Treads are valuable because they provide Tenacity

[](/sorcerersshoes ""Sorcerer's Shoes"") Gives great magic pen that does indeed stack

[](/ionianbootsoflucidity ""Ionian Boots of Lucidity"") OP [](/vladimir ""Vladimir"") boots. Lol Anyways perfect item for that need to cap your CDR in an easier and more cost efficient way.

[](/bootsofmobility ""Boots of Mobility"") Great boots for agressive (I get it on all supports) supports because it allows you to easily zone enemies and even chase in prolonged fights. Also great boots for utility junglers that want to initiate fights. E.g. [](/alistar ""Alistar"") [](/skarner ""Skarner"") [](/maokai ""Maokai"")

[](/bootsofswiftness ""Boots of Swiftness"") Probably one of the less used boots and for a good reason

**A-Z Items**

[](/abyssalscepter ""Abyssal Scepter"") The famous Azingy [](/amumu ""Amumu"") has brought this item back into superb public viability as a good AP and MR item. Not only was Azingy a person whom showed this item the light of day

[](/aegisofthelegion ""Aegis Of the Legion"") A must buy team item (Generally bought on supports) because it buffs your entire team with Armor

[](/archangelsstaff ""Archangels Staff"") Good item for mid laners that are very mana dependant such as [](/karthus ""Karthus"") and or [](/kogmaw ""Kog'Maw""). Provides a growing mana pool via spell casts that builds from [](/tearofthegoddess ""Tear of the Goddess""). Also gives AP, and AP via percentage of the amount of mana you have. Situational item indeed, but aside that a pretty good item for AP mids. NEVER BUY ON MANALESS CHAMPS CAUSE ENTIRE TEAM WILL BE LIKE WAT [](/katarina ""RETARD"")

ATHENES UNHOLY GRAIL: Expensive item for what its worth but gives nice defensive stats. Its basically a strong early game [](/rodofages ""Rod of Ages"") that will last you the entirety of the game because it has so many beneficial stats. I like this item for people like [](/galio) and [](/anivia) and even AP [](/kog)

[](/atmasimpaler ""Atmas Impaler"") Good item if you have at least 2k hp because it scales off of your HP! It was nerfed recently

[](/avariceblade ""Avarice Blade"") Decent GP10 item for junglers that are building into [](/youmuusghostblade ""Youmuu's Ghostblade"") and an alright item for some top laners to start raking in the gold. Crits for days.

[](/bansheesveil ""Banshee's Veil"") Amazing counter initiation item for high priority targets. This item can really restrict and enemy team chosing their engages if they have to open up with a cc or some form of burst combo that will be negated. I like this item situationally of course as it is very expensive and [](/quicksilversash ""QQ"") is much cheaper and provides nearly the same protection. I'd buy this on AP's such as [](/kogmaw ""Kog'Maw"") [](/ryze ""Ryze"") ETC.

[](/bilgewatercutlass ""Bilgewater Cutlass"") Good item buildup into [](/hextechgunblade ""RIP LEE SIN""). Preferably on [](/jax ""Jax"") I go [](/bootsofspeed ""Boots"") double [](/doransblade ""Doran's Blade"") into [](/bilgewatercutlass ""Bilgewater Cutlass"") then maybe a [](/phage ""Phage"") into [](/hextechgunblade ""RIP LEE SIN""). I like the lifesteal this item provides for the cost along with the slow active. :3 

[](/catalysttheprotector ""Catalyst The Protector"") Decent item for laners especially whom have no natural form of sustain such as... a majority of mid lane champions. Gives decent HP and mana for the cost along with a relatively cheap buildup. 

[](/chaliceofharmony ""Chalice of Harmony"") Chalice has come into play more now with the addition of Athenes unholy grail. Allways been an amazing item for people whom need the mana regen and MR such as [](/anivia ""Anivia"") and [](/galio ""Galio"").  

[](/deathfiregrasp ""Deathfire Grasp"") Great burst AP item for mid laners. Works perfectly for people like [](/annie ""Annie"") and [](/veigar ""Veigar""). Overall CDR

[](/doransblade ""Doran's Blade"") AD carries and Top laners pride and joy. AD carries generally want these because it gives a form of tankiness with the 80 HP

[](/doransring ""Doran's Ring"") AP carries specifically get these to enchance their laning sustain w/ mana. Think of champs like [](/morgana ""Morgana"")

[](/doransshield ""Doran's Shield"") Unlike the other doran items

[](/emblemofvalor ""Emblem of Valor"") Okay item buildup for the cost. Gives decent armor and HP regen aura. IMO I dont value [](/locketoftheironsolari ""WAT"") as much as most support players but eh

[](/executionerscalling ""Executioners Calling"") Good item versus teams without ignite (But really?). In retrospect for the price its an alright early game item for top laners to eliminate the healing functionality of a chapion. Perhaps versus people like [](/vladimir ""hue"") or [](/swain ""NOXUS"").

[](/forceofnature ""Force of Nature"") Great item versus AP centric teams. The movement speed helps a tad but isnt very noticeable in fights. I believe the strongest part of this item is the % HP regen. This coupled with something like a warmogs and a spirit visage will make people like [](/drmundo ""MOONDOH"") very scary. 

[](/frozenheart ""Frozen Heart"") Arguably one of the best items in the entire game. Gives CDR, and an attack speed slow debuff for enemies. This is like the god tier item for bruisers. People like [](/olaf ""Br0macicaca"") [](/malphite ""Rawk Solid"") are amazing with this because of the CDR it gives allowing him to use E effectively more so than before (obviously). 

[](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"") Gives HP

[](/giantsbelt ""Giants Belt"") Good buildup item for champions who want to build into all of the following [](/giantsbelt  ""so much hp"") items. Main part of most of the items except for [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"")'s case because [](/phage) is better since it gives more effective stats. 

[](/glacialshroud ""Glacial Shroud"") As I said about [](/frozenheart ""Frozen Heart"") ""Arguably one of the best items in the entire game"" , and CDR. 

[](/guardianangel ""Guardian Angel"") The AD carry [](/zhonyashourglass ""Zhonya's"") essentially. This is a ""High priority"" fail safe essentially. If you are stomping the enemy and you get GA... then if they manage to kill you then they have to kill you twice

[](/guinsoosrageblade ""Guinsoos Rageblade"") Alright item for going old school [](/jax ""Jax"") build. I havent looked into the item much for anyone anymore because its outscaled by other items at this point in time. It gives decent attack speed and AP/AD for the price

[](/hauntingguise ""Haunting Guise"") Meh item for ap's. It was going to get buffed to give movement speed

[](/heartofgold ""Heart of Gold"") Great support/jungler/top laner/ap mid (going gp10 build). Gives alot of HP for the price and along w/ the 5gp10. You can go [](/heartofgold ""HoG"") first on tanky supports so you have easier initiates with more HP.

[](/hexdrinker ""Hexdrinker"") Good MR item with AD. Perfect item for people like [](/riven ""Riven"") and [](/olaf ""Olaf"") versus people like [](/kennen ""Kennen"") and [](/rumble ""Rumble""). In some cases you cant just build straight MR to counter Ap's so you need some form of damage to deal with them.

[](/hextechgunblade ""Hextech Gunblade"") Great item for champions that scale off AP and AD (Who dosent). Specifically champions like [](/mordekaiser ""Morde"") and [](/katarnia"" Kat""). The active is pretty op too whilst you one combo someone :3.

[](/hextechrevolver ""Most OP item"") Super sustain [](/vladimir ""Vlad""). You sad? Its k. Anyways great Ap along with the ridiculous ability to sustain your damage with your spells... which is probably one of the more broken things in this game IMO. AKA if you have no mana or a constant blue buff then you are godlike essentially. People without sustain cant trade with you unless they burst you

[](/infinityedge ""Infinity Edge"") Strongest item in the game mathematically. Enough said. Does the most damage consistantly over the course of 10 seconds because of the Increased crit damage and already high base AD value. This is the reason why AD carries are fucking crazy

[](/ionicspark ""Ionic Spark"") Great pushing item especially with the recent buffs to the damage. Gives decent HP and has seen alot of love from [](/udyr ""Oh deer"") [](/shen ""Shawn"") and even some [](/irelia ""Irelia"") players. Gives alot of attack speed for the item buildup and as I said the HP value is decent.

[](/kagesluckypick ""Kage's Lucky Pick"") So this is actually a reference from the Tenacious D movie. OP... anyways gives decent AP and 5 gp10. Builds into [](/deathfiregrasp ""DFG"") so its a good item to net early on in the game for ap's if you have an idea into building it.

[](/kindlegem ""Kindlegem"") Great buildup item for supports. Gives CDR

[](/lastwhisper ""Last Whisper"") Must buy AD carry item versus armor. Essentially that all I should put

[](/lichbane ""Lichbane"") Amazing burst AP item for champions like [](/twistedfate ""TF"") that rely on their auto attacks or a combo to do massive damage. [](/sion ""Sion"") is also a good example of someone I would buy this on. This is good for ap's because THE DAMAGE YOU DO ON YOU AA'S (Auto attacks) IS BASED OFF YOUR AP. Its an AP [](/trinityforce ""Tri Force"") essentially.

[](/locketoftheironsolari ""Locket of the Iron Solari"") 300 HP, but I still believe that building into randuins with your [](/heartofgold ""Heart of Gouuud"") is more beneficial to you. Still works in team comps that are taking alot of burst AOE damage to further mitigate it. Also its derived from [](/leona ""Playtonics"") lore so... yeah thats pretty coo.

[](/malady ""Malady"") Attack speed, and AP. A great item for people like [](/teemo ""Teemo"") whom scale off of their AP and attack speed. Old [](/twitch ""Twitch"") used to work with the 5 [](/malady ""Malady"") build :3

MANAMUNE: Good item for heroes that need high base mana and attack damage along with mana regen. This item works for [](/yorick ""Yorick"") and [](/urgot ""Urgot"") specifically because it gives decent AD and you need mana in order to do anything with both of these heroes. I like manamune specifically only on these heroes thus far.

[](/mawofmalmortius ""Maw of Malmortius"") Maw is a good item that builds from [](/hexdrinker ""Orange Juice Sword""). Provides MR, and Damage per % you are missing. OP OP. In reality I get this on people like [](/olaf ""Br0maciiaa"") and things like that.

[](/morelloseviltome ""Morello's Evil Tome"") Ideally same concept as [](/executionerscalling ""Executioners Calling"")

[](/nashorstooth ""Nashor's Tooth"") Okay item for champions whom need AP

[](/phage ""Phage"") Phage is an amazing item and a beautiful build up item into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") and [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet""). Preferablly you go [](/phage ""Phage"") first into your build up of the corresponding items because it is the best item that builds into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"").

[](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") AD carries main source of damage figuratively since it gives the best stats for Ad's aside from the actual damage portion. Movement speed coupled with crit and attack speed will change their dps greatly. I generally go [](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") after my main damage item (such as) [](/infinityedge ""Infinity Edge"") or [](/thebloodthirster ""Bloodthirster""). The only AD I would ever build [](/phantomdancer ""Phantom Dancer"") first on would probably be [](/kogmaw ""Kock maw"") since he has amazing damage with his W on. Also if you are supported by people like [](/janna ""Jenga"") or [](/nunu ""Nunu"") you get either a shield that is a free [](/bfsword ""B.F. Sword"") or an attack speed buff that further increases your already high DPS.

[](/philosophersstone ""Philosopher's Stone"") The ""Gp10 item"" Gives HP regen and 5gp10. Has a good buildup into [](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"") but it is one of the more expensive gp10's.

[](/quicksilversash ""Quicksilver Sash"") AD CARRIES BES ITEM. Anyways provides decent MR and an amazing active. You can get out of ALL forms of CC and most if not all activate's on items

[](/rabadonsdeathcap ""Rabadon's Deathcap"") Essential AP item for all mid laners. Gives the highest AP damage in the game and is a must as I said for mid laners.

[](/randuinsomen ""Randuin's Omen"") Great item for straight up countering auto attackers in general. Pretty much an AD counter item and counters people such as [](/irelia ""NERF""). Gives decent 

[](/rodofages ""Rod of Ages"") Decent item for AP mids. Gives some tankiness and HP. Also gives a form of sustain from the catalyst passive. :3 [](/karthus ""R TO WIN"") Loves this item ;).

[](/rylaiscrystalscepter ""Rylai's Crystal Scepter"") Gives HP

[](/sheen ""Sheen"") Strong buildup into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") and [](/lichbane ""Lichbane"") 

[](/shurelyasreverie ""Shurelya's Reverie"") Support item and utility jungler item. Gives the HP regen and HP along with the movement speed active. Buy this item to better engage or disengage fights to maximize your teams utility.

[](/soulshroud ""Soul Shroud"") Decent item for HP and cdr

[](/spiritvisage ""Spirit Visage"") Amazing item for counter AP and the passive allows for some crazy sustain. People like [](/renekton ""rararararawr"") and [](/vladimir ""Vlad"") can benefit from this is they are constantly bogged down by magic damage.

[](/sunfirecape ""Sunfire Cape"") Sunfire gives decent armor and HP as an early game item. Azingy's [](/amumu ""mumu"") build [](/sunfirecape) and [](/abyssalscepter) for the crazy AOE magic shred (yeah that damage is affected by the magic pen) :3. This item can also work on [](/shen) to splitpush better. Earlyish game item.

[](/tearofthegoddess ""Tear of the Goddess"") Stacking continually increasing mana pool item. I like this item on [](/ryze ""Ryze"") since he scales so well with mana. Also works with certain laners like AP (/kogmaw ""Kog'maw"") since he is very mana reliant.

[](/theblackcleaver ""The Black Cleaver"") Mathematically [](/theblackcleaver ""Black Cleaver"") will do more damage on enemies with less than 200 armor. SO lategame when you need to kill that xx420Kusmaster420xx armor malphite.... ._. then obviously get [](/lastwhisper ""Last Whisper""). This is basically a snowball item for certain champions. In solo q when im playing [](/ezreal ""Ezreal"") ill get it to further increase my snowball (if I already am) or in certain situations like the Imaqtpie [](/corki ""Corki"") [](/taric ""Taric"") armor shred combo. Situational item once again.

[](/thebloodthirster ""The Bloodthirster"") Stacking physical damage and sustain item. Must buy for ad carries later on because its the ""best"" sustain item for ad's. also provides 100 AD fully stacked. 

[](/thebrutalizer ""The Brutalizer"") Good item early game versus heavy armor top lanes

[](/thornmail ""Thornmail"") Good item versus non sustain physical damage. 

[](/tiamat ""Tiamat"") Pretty trolly item IMO. Provides ""decent"" stats for its price but there are better buys. Probably works best on [](/fiora ""Bitch"") more than anything else in this game.

[](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") Provides [](/corki ""Corks"") and [](/ezreal ""PFE"") utility and burst. Thats pretty much it. Phantom dancer is better late game but an early game [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"") wrecks everything. Also works on bruisers and junglers beautifully as well giving the auto attack slow and just overall solid damage

[](/voidstaff ""Void Staff"") Enemies building MR? DIE ENEMY. Really just buy this if the enemies build MR... enough said.

[](/wardensmail ""Warden's Mail"") Good item to actually get early. Yes... early, and gives HP regen.

[](/warmogsarmor ""Warmog's Armor"") YOU WANT HP? YOU LIKE TO FARM? Here's 1.3k hp.. here ya go. Great item for bruisers although [](/frozenmallet ""Frozen Mallet"") is better

[](/willoftheancients ""Will of the Ancients"") Most broken item in the game

[](/witsend ""Wit's End"") Amazing item for junglers and top laners that need damage and a decent amound of MR. Does stacking damage on auto attacks and gives attack speed. [](/shen) [](/irelia) approve!

[](/wriggleslantern ""Wriggles Lantern"") Good early game item versus physical damage to better sustain in either the jungle or top lane. Self explanatory early game item.

[](/youmuusghostblade ""Youmuu's Ghostblade"") Decent jungler and top laner item after you build into brutalizer. Generally you can get this item on people like [](/nocturne ""Nocturne"") in the jungle and do immense damage if snowballed. This item is probably on a top 10 list of snowbally items. The Movespeed buff it gives while activated is pretty crazy and allows for netting some easy kills w/ redbuff as a jungler. 

[](/zeal ""Zeal"") Zeal is probably the last item you might build into [](/trinityforce ""Trinity Force"")

[](/zekesherald ""Zeke's Herald"") Good item for a AD heavy team comp

[](/zhonyashourglass ""Zhonya's Hourglass"") Perfect item for AP mids when they need decent armor and the ability to control fights with a ""reset button"". This would be their one and only reset button item wise other than a [](/guardianangel ""Guardian Angel""). You can do beautiful things with this item such as a 5 man ultimate via [](/morgana ""Morgana"") or a bait a whole team to waste all their aoe's on you whilst in your stasis.

Trying to not make it sound too QQ here but I've been losing interest in playing normals/ranked recently.  Solo queuing is a nightmare and a few friends that I used to play premades with have switched to Diablo 3 for the time being (aka the rest of the summer).  However

So, or 5v5s depending on level of interest overall and at any given time.  Now, the reason I'm posting this here in r/summonerschool is because I want it to be known that **ANYONE** is welcome to play in these.  Whether you are level 1 or level 30 with 1000+ wins.

I want these to be a no pressure atmosphere where we can still try our best during the game

As well as playing these games to help improve and learn without having to solo queue

Hopefully you all get the gist of what this is about.  I'd like to start playing with more r/summonerschool people because I played a sunday night scrims game a while back when CrAzY MoFo 13 was still in charge and I really enjoyed that game (JUNGLE UDYR CARRY HARD FTW).  However

If there is some formal method already enacted of basically grouping people that want to play games

**EDIT:  Oh and my internet.  My internet is sometimes crap where I'm living right now and don't want to lose Elo because of random ping spiking/complete disconnect.  Another reason I am not feeling the normals/ranked games.**

EDIT2:  Ok after pitching the idea a few times to some people, or just don't feel quite comfortable queuing in normals/ranked yet.  These games would be played identical to normals/ranked games.  They're simply in house games geared towards the objectives listed above.  If you aren't interested, that's perfectly fine.  LoL is geared towards playing normals/ranked anyway.  But I know there are probably others out there who feel the same way I do right now, and hopefully playing some fun custom in-house games can be a way to pass the time before we're ready to dive back into normals/ranked.  And if you're not sure whether you want to or not, just try playing a game :D

So. You queue for a game and get faced against someone. They jump in and harass you. You're down in the exchange.

""Oh god

Every champion has cooldowns. The vast, if he uses it **once**, he can't use it again **immediately** - which means he is vulnerable immediately after a teleport.

This may seem like basic knowledge to most of you, you should be able to exchange with her very, very favorably as any of the AD carries until it returns from CD. Also, if Swain just missed his snare, **he can't snare you**. Jump in and beat that bird-man up.

Most characters are fully capable of harassing in relatively small timing windows (0-3 seconds, and pull back behind your minions. Some characters want exchanges to go on longer (like Irelia) whereas some want them to end quickly (like Brand). You can tell because their kit is centered around hitting all the buttons really fast VS. passive benefits or spaced-out abilities. 

The trick to winning your lane is to figure out what the weakness of your opponent's character is. Most characters have cooldowns as a weakness. Twisted Fate can't stun you if he just threw a mana regen card. Nasus can't Q you if he just hit a minion with it. Ashe can't hurt really anyone at all if she just used a volley to farm. There are some characters that don't really have cooldowns as a weakness

So yeah. Figure out the cooldown weakness of your enemy. Sion just threw up his shield? He can't detonate it immediately

1375976595.0,1jym1t,[Guide] Mordekaiser: The Master of AFK Mid,ForteEXE,34,5,40,"Hello there! Do you have a moment to talk about ~~Our Lord and Savior

Let's begin by discussing what Mordekaiser is. He's an **Ability Power Carry** typically played in **mid lane** or **top lane**. This will cover how to play him in **mid lane**. He's also one of the most easy-to-farm mid laner champions in the game and has a shield mechanic that makes him naturally tanky. His spells

For masteries

For runes

* Magic Penetration Reds
* Flat Armor Yellows
* Flat Magic Resistance (Or Scaling
* Ability Power Quintessences (If you're feeling badass and like you can get away with it

There's quite a few ways to build Morde. I'm going to cover the way I **personally** build Mordekaiser

This is just how I do things

Now then

* If vs AP: Rejuve Bead + Two Wards + 4 Health Potions / Warding is KEY with Morde

* If vs AD: Cloth Armor + 5 Health Potions / You won't have wards

Core items time. Now see I said earlier Morde can be built a few days

**Core Items:**

* Sorcerer Shoes (Morde's ult scales with Mpen

* Liandry's Torment (Again

* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith (This item first started seeing use on laners by high elo Vladimir players due to what it provides: CDR

A full build for me typically is:

**Vs AP**:

* Sorcerer Shoes
* Liandry's Torment
* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith
* Rylai's Crystal Scepter
* Rabadon's Deathcap
* Situational Item (Usually Void

**Vs AD:**

* Sorcerer Shoes
* Liandry's Torment
* Spirit of the Spectral Wraith
* Zhonya's Hourglass
* Rabadon's Deathcap
* Situational Item (You may want to go Abyssal for an all-around tanky Morde or Void. Or if you feel like you can get away with it

For spells

We've covered items

* Passive - Iron Man / 35% of Morde's spell damage is converted into a shield. Half reduction vs minions. This is how you generate shield

* Q - Mace of Spades / Morde's secondary farming tool, .4 per ability point**. If alone, the damage is **1.65 per AD, .66 per AP**. Base damage is increased 65% as well. Also note it resets Mordekaiser's autoattack and works like Twisted Fate's Pick a Card (W) and Fizz's Urchin Strike (Q) in that it will convert items such as Sheen into magic damage. Health cost per use is: **25/32/39/46/53**.

* W - Creeping Death / Mordekaiser's armor/MR steroid spell. This will, rank 5 you will receive 30 of both. This ability scales at **.2 ability power**. Health cost per use is: **26/32/38/44/50**.

* E - Siphon of Destruction / Mordekaiser's main farming and pushing tool. This ability is a **cone-based skillshot** and will deal 70/115/160/205/250 damage with a **.6 ability power modifier** to all enemies caught within it. This is typically how you will maintain your shield most of the time

* R - Children of the Grave / This is Mordekaiser's ultimate spell, you **gain control of their soul, represented as a cloned enemy champion pet** for a total of **30 seconds**. Meaning if you ghost an enemy Vayne and they die, you have a pet Vayne to wreak havoc on their team! Fun, huh? Try to save this for the ADC in teamfights. Note: This ability will **stack** with spellvamp, so you will receive extra HP stolen on top of what the ult grants you by default.

Those're the basic overview. I intend to go back and fix mistakes, but have my thoughts on how it'd go. When noted, please use at your own risk. It may not work the way I think it would.

**Matches you win**:

* Vladimir / Vladimir wants to sustain and afk farm and poke you. You're Mordekaiser, combine it with Ignite for bloodstains all over the place.

* Morgana / It was once said on r/leagueoflegends this quote during 2011 and early/mid 2012: ""You know how nobody can outpush or outsustain Morgana? Well turns out that nobody wears spiky armor and goes huehuehueBR?"". It's true. Mordekaiser will outpush her, you need to take mid and go roam.

* LeBlanc/Syndra/Lux/Insert Generic Burst Champ Here - Mordekaiser gives absolutely zero damns about the fancy burst damage they can put out. His shield absorbs it and he can still maintain it if they engage around minions. Now beware, listed lower on. Note on Lux: Always watch when she leaves lane to ult bot/top during a fight or gank. This is a vital thing to do vs any Lux and not just in general. Credit goes to **AsheIsElite** for this tip.

* Fizz/Kassadin / These two, then you'll have a problem.

* Karthus / He has something in his favor: He can still press R even if feeding and his lategame trumps your's. Win early

**Matchups you lose:**

* ~~Naruto~~ Ahri / The Fox can outpush you, she's going to blow you up. One of the few APs that Morde sincerely needs to fear.

* Cassiopeia / DOT heavy, she's going to maintain keeping your shield down and staying on you with Q/E. Fortunately, Cassiopeias tend to have a tendency to oom themselves. You may want to try exploiting that. Failing that, call for a jungler gank. Also dodge her Q, it's her main lead-in to damage.


* Malzahar / DOT heavy, you're going to need it vs him. His silence is a huge pain for you and helps him push a lane harder with E. Don't get caught far from tower when he hits 6.

* Swain / He punishes melee pretty hard and has the DOT to kill your shield. Come 6

* Annie / Despite being good/strong vs burst

**Matches that are uncertain**:

* Kennen / I don't know about this one anymore. Kennen can autoattack you when you go in

* Diana / I want to say item changes have slanted this towards Diana. For a while Morde was the winner due to him being able to dump on most melee. However, etc) and Diana's shield changes have changed the matchup's dynamics. If I had to pick, I'd say Diana should win if she's smart.

* Talon / He's melee, Seeker's Armguard didn't exist. Things've changed and it's easier for a Morde to manage vs a Talon. Don't underestimate him though, he can still put out terrifying damage if he gets even a little ahead.

These matchups are by no means complete

**Tips

* Your W is useful for farming at a distance

* Don't be scared to use your ult to save your ass if you're getting jumped. The heal + spellvamp off revolver/Spectral can turn a gank around

* When you shove mid, 3 if you're experienced enough. But judge how long it takes you to clear wraiths, vs how hard mid is pushing. You want to find a balance between taking wolves/wraiths and farming mid. Best plan, I find, is shove mid hard -&gt; go take jungle camps. At level 4-5, it gives you enough time to get them before minions hit midway river.

To close it out, you're quite hard to stop.

You're also possibly the only champion, ignite, smack her and you've got yourself a fun time.

* **ALWAYS WARD WITH MORDEKAISER**. He's one of the most vulnerable-to-gank champions in the game. Whenever you b

First

**Why?**

First you want to identify why you are playing rank. This will help a lot because it is a lot easier to know what to do when you are clear as to what you want. Do you simply want to play in a more serious environment? Is there a certain Elo that you want to be at? How much time are willing to spend to get what you want? 

**Who?**

Who are you as a player? What role are you most comfortable with? What champions are you best with?
It's good to know what you want to do. In knowing what you are comfortable with you should inform your team of this

**Familiarize yourself with every role.**

It's good to specialize in one role, the better you will become as a player.
You need to have at least two champions that you feel comfortable playing for every role. You don't want to be that guy that doesn't have a clue as to what to pick because he got forced into a role he has no clue about. 

**Team composition matters.**

Don't be stubborn and pick what you want; you need to learn to pick what your team needs. Understanding this is extremely important and requires you to have a good general knowledge of every champion. Ideally

Championselect.net helps

**Taste the flavors.**

Flavor of the month (FOTM) champions are FOTM for a reason. Learn them

**There's no rush.**

Another thing that you need to know is that there is no rush. Your first ten matches can save you A LOT of time. One game is basically worth around ten games. So don't feel the need to get it ""over with;"" play when you feel you are at the top of your game. Perhaps win a few normal games first. A couple helpful tips are: always warm up with a pre-game and don't EVER play when you are upset/feeling down.

**Take breaks**

Don't be stubborn and continue to play when you are losing. You should play a few normals or just stop playing for a little bit. Chances are that if you continue to play you will continue to lose and it gets harder and harder every game.

**The Duo Rule**

Before I go into this

**These are a few rules to duo successfully:**

A: Don't get attached with your duo partner.

B: Never continue to duo when the outcome is negative(W/L wise)

C: Don't duo with people you aren't comfortable with.

D: Be honest. Be clear. Be realistic.

A: Don't be get attached with your duo partner. Do things objectively and don't overly rely on your duo partner. Your goal is to win and improve. You shouldn't just rely on your partner hoping for a free Elo (Unless that's your goal.)

B: Don't continue to play with each other if you keep losing. I normally stop playing with someone if I go past -2. 

C &amp; D: Don't duo if you can't be honest with them. Be clear as to what they need to do and what you expect them to do. Be realistic; if they are doing something wrong

**Be constructive.**

* Examples of things not to say:
* Stop feeding!
* Wdf are you doing?
* Why would you do that?
* I have no idea what you're doing.
* That was probably the worst play I have ever witness.


**Examples of things you should be saying:**

* You might want to buy wards since you are getting ganked quite a bit.
* I hear Darius doesn't do that well against Jayce so you should play safe until the jungler helps you.
* It's not that big of a deal that you're behind. Just focus on farming so that we can take it to late game.
* You might want to buy some armor because they have 3 ADs on their team.


**Be positive.**

You should not rage or have negative thoughts

**Get objectives.**

You should always be doing something. For example: always be farming, RED FOR ADC.) Make sure you take down towers. You should light up the map if you're playing support and let the enemy team experience the darkness when you have oracles. Most importantly never sit around and wait for the enemy team to do something. 

**Take charge.**

Communicate with your team. Make calls

Note: There is a difference between leading your team and just being a bossy teammate. ",self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1ixhw0/the_mentality_you_need_to_have_while_ranking_and/

Now back to the original subject

**Aram Games** - Anyone can join them.

**Novice Game** - Anyone ranging from Bronze V to Bronze I can join

**Intermediate Game** - Anyone from Silver V to Gold I can join

**Advanced Game** - These games are for those in between Platinum V and Diamond I

**Shout casting** - Have you ever wanted to try shout casting? Maybe you've done it before and liked it, either Color Commentary or Play-by-Play you will cast either one Aram game or one Novice game, just for you to get hang of the basics and to get the chance to do it with someone who has done it before.

**Requirements Play-by-Play** - We prefer that you are able to speak fast and fluently

**Requirements Color Commentary** - Here we require that you have a better knowledge of the game, why they are building a certain item, you are also going to have to break down team fights and explain them after the fight has ended and explain what actually happened, who hit who, who died first, which summoner spells where used, etc. 

**Fine print** - For you to participate in these kind of games you must first accept the fact that the ENTIRE event will be streamed and shout casted
We will never aim to make profit by doing this and this is driven entirely by us. Since this is a community driven event there will be times where it won't be happening due to lack of applicants or lack of Streamer or Shout casters.

1371594284.0,1gm64j,Just a few things about Poppy...,dwoopy311,33,4,32,"There was another thread where someone asked who our favorite champion was
(this isn't a full guide

""Depends on the situation, but generally you'll want to go tri-force and then get some ad, although Rageblade(with it's recent buffs) and Gunblade are very powerful with the tri-force build if you add some attack speed like botrk or new wit's end. She does massive AP damage whether you build any ap or not, her q does 8% of their max hp in magic damage at level 1 so it's pretty powerful, not to mention spammable. Her w gives a ridonculous 25% speed boost with a low cooldown. I usually go 21/9/0 going down AD with armpen and AP with mpen but focusing on AD path. You can use whatever Runes you'd like but I use hybrid marks, AD quints for last-hitting, flat armour yellows and scaling magic resist blues. Remember to use ignite on the target of your ultimate, it's devastating.""

After this, what's the correlation? Well...

""It doesn't lifesteal or give ad/attack speed, about building her tanky, with her passive, they have to do 10% of your current health for it to do anything, so if you build her too tanky it's useless, that's why lifesteal with only 1 armour item (IBG) is so good. You can tear apart ad carries and get out with no damage taken if you use your ult. Which by then your team will have initiated and hopefully they've forgotten about poor old poppy.
Also she's VERY good in 3's played top. AP build with blackfire torch shreds virtually anyone. Also, you might want to practice with vayne if you haven't already.""

1) Watch streams. WingsOfDeathx is fantastic, and how to make plays. Phreak is fun to watch, though most of the times I've watched him have been pretty big fails (like Teemo games). Regardless, watching the pros play will give you strategies you didn't think of before. 

2) Practice. Never underestimate the power of ARAM, for the love of god. practice your abilities, wall hops, etc. go nuts. have fun with it. Then, take it to co-op, then to normals before you go ranked with that champ. You'll still get IP, and won't tank your ranked stats.

3) read. Wikis, and learn to do math on the fly based on the ability descriptions. League is getting difficult now with over 100 champs, but you see on average around 20. there shouldn't be any surprise from any of those 20.

4) when you lose a ranked match

In my mind, objectives etc.

Late game is where the tides turned. We could just not do any damage to Tryndamere whatsoever, and as an ad carry he could just spin through my entire team and three shot me with basic attacks. I know hard CC is the way to go against him, but no amount of TF yellow cards, Thresh flays, pulls, Boxes, Varus ults, or Nocturne fears could stop him from wrecking our entire team.

And even the times we could manage to kill him, him we had to focus him enough to kill him three times over.

In my eyes, attack speed, health, and resistances to withstand damage from an entire team whilst killing the carry in four autoattacks. Even if you DO manage to kill him, he can live on invulnerable for another FIVE seconds, and if you kill him after that he has GA to save him still. You either focus him to take him down three times over, giving his team enough time to kill, not to mention he has a heal. He also has a spin which he can flawlessly engage

* There is much less bitching and trolling and general nastiness than I expected. In fact, tempers do flare, but they do so in normals as well.

* After the normals, whether won or lost, people were making a genuine effort to win. After all the ""it is 0-3, surrender at 20 I am going AFK"" in blind normals, this attitude feels nice.

* Chances are, same as I did in the past. The two main reasons being, that draft-pick games seem to take much longer to setup, especially with all the dodgers and that you rarely get to play the champion and/or role that you actually want. In blind normals people are mostly OK with you taking any champion into any lane, but in ranked everyone expects you to follow the meta and take whatever role you get in the picks. I am lucky in a way, since I enjoy playing jungle and a lot of people seem to dislike jungling, so I got to jungle in 8 out of 10 games

**1. There is no be all to end all champion for each role.**
Each role has champions which excel, because people expect to be given a champion on a silver platter,  which is completely not possible. Every champion has strengths and weaknesses (which are forever changing due to nerfs, buffs and changes in flavors of the month), every champion has a counter, and counters others (the number can however vary). Simple right? Each champion is different, so asking for a single champion 

**2. Everyone has their own unique style of playing.**
While many people play similar to others, some people excel at AP champions, others at bruisers. Asking who you should use is like saying ""which colour is best?""..... there are millions of shades of different colours, just like there are millions of different unique players in LoL. 

**Solution to this annoying problem is simple. Play the champions that are mainstream for the role you wish to learn!!!!!**
If you try everything, ask for tips on SPECIFIC champions, but dont ask ""what should I pick"" because it's a wild goose chase on our part, as well as yours.

They would then create groups and then play/observe matches together with one of the coaches. I think that would work even better in LoL since its inherently a team game so lends itself to working with groups. 

We could for example create a match with 1 coach and 4 students on each side. Play it out with the coach trying to call the shots then have everyone watch a LoL replay of it together to look at what was done well and what mistakes were made and analyse why.

Not much is required - having a teamspeak/ventrillo/mumble server would be helpful - but even skype could work in the interrim. I'm happy to get involved in organising this for EUW at least.

This will help your map awareness. **Repeat this process** until you have taken all outer towers(or managed to push an inib if the situation called for it) or the enemy team has reacted to your craftiness and started grouping as well. It is now time to teamfight.

Unfortunately regarding teamfights i can't help you much

Nonetheless there are a few things that you can think about before a 5v5 breaks out. The most important being to **identify the biggest threats on both teams**. Once you have collected this information you should create a game plan for yourself with one idea in mind: protect the **good** carries on your team and always keep an eye on the carries in the enemy team. This is a very difficult skill to master and im fairly certain any high elo player will tell you that they get lost or tunnelvision in teamfights every now and then. Every second of a team fight you need to make sure that your carries are safe and in position to deal damage AND the opponent's carries have not committed a mistake. What if you are the only one fed on your team? Then you are the carry and need to act accordingly: **use your team as bait**. Let the opponent tunnel vision on your squishy teammates and then target their carries. Enter the teamfight late if you must and cleanup the initial dmg done by your team. Do **not** commit to killing their adc as a fed bruiser if it means a 1v1 trade

Hopefully the enemy carries have made a mistake and you have capitalized on it. You have turned the tide in your team's favor and more friends than foes are still standing. Your first reaction after each teamfight is to **look for objectives that can be taken** (don't farm, **consider following them**. This is the late game where mistakes are costly - being split is often worse than taking the wrong objective.

Rinse an repeat until you have successfully pushed an inib. Continue to try catching the enemy unaware and if that doesn't work


##**Misc tips**

**timing objectives**

First buffs respawn by 7:10. If you or your jungler have taken an early lead coordinate with your jungler around 6:00 to counter the first respawn. On the contrary if you have fallen behind make sure you buy wards so they can't pick you off as you attempt to catch up. Try to **time all drags/nash**. If you don't think about it when you first get the objective just look at the chat and use the timestamp in order to find out when they respawn. Coordinate your team at least 1 minute before they spawn


**creep wave management**

When to push

The 3 factors you must take into account are:

1. The state of the lane: Is it pushing to your tower? Is it pushing to to the enemy tower? At what rate? Or is it even?

2. The state of the lane that would most benefit the laner when you get back. Are you capable of zoning the enemy? best scenario is a pushing lane right in front of your tower so you can freeze it.
3. Your ability to push a lane. If you are a slow pusher you will give time to the opponent to get back from his death and 1) give him full xp 2) give him security under tower 3) put yourself/your laner at risk because his lane is now pushed and weak to ganks. **This is a very big mistake and can completely negate a kill obtained 1v1**

Before I go any further I want to mention something important: **Last hitting an even lane pushes it**. You know those times where the laner spam pings a jungler to not touch a lane and they wisely retort ""but i'm only last hitting

Now that you have this in mind

The most obvious scenario: Your creeps are pushing. **always shove it into the enemy tower**. This does 3 things: denies enemy gold and xp

The less obvious scenario: The enemy creeps are pushing. You have 3 options here:

1. You are capable of handling your opponent when he gets back without buying any extra items(aka you have a big lead) - keep last hitting and freeze the lane.

2. You are not capable of handling the opponent who will have have bought more items than you:

    1. if you(and your jungler) have the pushing power - shove it into the enemy tower.

    2. If you cannot push it

How to freeze a lane? Simply keep more enemy creeps alive after each wave. The soft spot is something close to 2-3 ranged creeps. That way the enemy creeps will kill yours faster and you(the player) will dictate how fast the creepwave should die.

##**Jungler specific information**

After consideration this will probably be included in a seperate post starting back at lvl 1

##**Final notes**

For starters I'll say that the LoL elo system works, but it has less to do with how hard it is to carry your teammates, and more to do with how unlucky you have been in your matchmaking). **If you cannot reach that next league then you are simply not good enough for it**. In fact the current system is quite forgiving in this respect: Lose streaks happen, and so do win streaks. If you reach the next league(from which you can't fall anymore) at the height of a winstreak you do not actually deserve it(even though you might think so). It's time to start improving; the best way to do this is to be **self-critical** at all times. It also helps to identify good plays(yours or not); even during my bronze session I found myself thinking ""wow great play"" or ""holy shit that was good"" about others, both teammates and opponents.

A followup to this is: **You cannot win every game**. In fact you cannot even win a high percentage of your games unless you belong in a much higher league. If you start in bronze as a silver player

Why did I not talk about AFKs and such? Simply because this post is directed at every game in which **you** are the deciding factor. You will lose every game where there are 4 afks on your team and you will win every game where there are 4 afks on the enemy team. Some games you simply cannot win, your individual skill is meaningless if you cannot cooperate.

Finally I'd like to state that there is a lot of information in these posts, I can assure you that if you are in bronze, silver or gold you probably do not know it all, and you **certainly** do not apply it all. I also don't believe that you are capable of incorporating it all after a single read and a few games; systematically thinking about the next moves takes practice and most of all familiarity with the champion you are playing. Tactical skills go hand in hand with mechanical skills. So i suppose my ultimate tip would be to master a few champions and include bit by bit these notions into your arsenal of tactics.

1364992363.0,1bl0ct,[Theory]What defines an ADC?,MedalsNScars,38,11,95,"Almost every ADC has different features to their kit. There are burst ADCs, and so on.

The two things all ADCs have in common

In League of Legends there are currently 14 or 15 legitimate

Caitlyn, Miss Fortune, Ezreal, Draven, Corki, Tristana, Twitch, Quinn, and I suppose you could include Urgot.

But there are tons of ranged characters(52

So I took a look at the other 37 ranged champions' base stats and kits and noticed a few champions that could I think could be played as ADCs but rarely ever are

|Thresh|475|39.22|63.13|971.0|922.8|.625|.738|

EDIT: Treated Orianna's DPS same as Twitch's (her passive damage per hit increases on each hit by 20%

Quick rundown on my reasoning for each:

**Kennen**: Average ADC range, decent escape skill, good poke, has a stun, manaless. Personally, I think he would make a very strong ADC, biggest weakness is poke doesn't scale with AD.

**Ziggs**: Above average ADC range, strong base damage on skills, has a slow and a displace.

**TF**: Slightly below average range

**Sona**: Average ADC range, that ult. Pretty weak case here, but it certainly *could* be done. Might get the element of surprise too.

**Lulu**: Her passive actually makes her hit like a truck

**Orianna**: Again, but I think it could be done.


**Nidalee**: Below average range, with her armor debuff on human W and the absurd finishing damage on animal Q. That said she's be super squishy and her range isn't great, so you'd definitely have to know what you're doing.

**Teemo**: His single-target sustained DPS is just absurd with his toxic darts and naturally high AS. Unfortunately his range is only 500 and he's pretty squishy

**Jayce**: Very similar stats to your standard ADCs

**Thresh**: He seems pretty horrible as an ADC, though, so I'm just going to pretend I didn't even put him on this list.
___
There's a few other champs whose base stats let you feel like they could be played as a subpar ADC

Annie (625 Range and a Armor/MR buff and stun

Anivia (600 Range

Zilean (600 Range

Nami (550 Range, especially when you consider that she has no trading abilities.)

Ahri (550 Range, .668 base AS, solid escape. If I'd consider any of these it'd be her, but she's definitely pretty lackluster as an ADC)

Zyra (575 Range, she brings a lot of utility to the table, but all her casting animations take away from the little sustained DPS she has. Probably better pretty much anywhere else.)

Then every other ranged character would be abysmally bad at ADC from what I see in their stats.

1356993210.0,15quix,How to help you and your friends to stay as a team during games. A fun way to get stronger at late game.,vGoNebulous,29,4,13,"We all have been in those situations where laning phase went even, people stay in their lanes while the other team groups and just pushes towers. Then, or whatever program you use

There is TL;DR near bottom if you don’t want to read.

I have a suggestion.

Pick an AOE team comp, make you feel really good, and make everyone feel like they had a big part in the fight.

I bring this up because sometimes your friends (or you) just don’t know when to group, Nocturne, Shen and others are great split pushers, but give that player the mindset that they either can’t team fight, or are stronger not. Even if subliminal, it happens to the best of us.

Example: Last night


Mid Laner: Orianna

Top Laner: Wukong

Jungler: Malphite

AD Carry: Miss Fortune

Support: Lulu


Our idea was this

Orianna puts ball on Malphite with Command:Protect

Malphite Ults in when a good opportunity comes up

Orianna ults to keep all 5 in group

Lulu ults Malphite to knock them up again

Wukong Nimbus Strike’s in then ults

Miss Fortune sets herself up for her ult and then ults as or soon after

Everyone was excited to make this happen, and did pretty well in lane (one lane went even, one won hard, and one lost) and Malphite (me) in the jungle helped those who had trouble.


As soon as team fight time started (laning phase was over) we grouped and pushed. Wukong left to farm and Lulu backed to buy something, and Miss Fortune got brutally murdered when they were engaged on.


After seeing this, and everyone else realized they had to stay as 5 almost always to make this happen. And, without going into too much detail, we wiffed a couple attempts (missed malph ult, MF got killed before ult, no ball on malph or whatever) and then finally, when we were posturing under one of their towers, I saw the perfect Malph ult opportunity


It was glorious


What I noticed our team did differently from normal games was the following:

Stayed as a team almost the entire post-laning phase

really had a solid plan for how to do team fights

knew what could stop us and avoided it

Generally just played better as a team

So


TL;DR: If you and your friends are having a hard time staying as a team and not getting caught out, and all over stronger than your opponents.

That way if you press W then V fast you'll get an insta-buff. No more bloodboiling minions!

This also makes teamfights a little easier since you dont accidentally bloodboil someone other than the AD.

Short (kind of) introduction - My IGN is Tendresse, it does show that I have a reasonable knowledge about this game. 

I've always been aware of the massive amount of information and help available to help newer players pick up this excellent game, it was nothing but a .txt document posted as a single post on the forums of a small gaming community I'm part of. But then I started adding more and more content, and finally decided to port it to solomid.net's guides' section to make use of the visibility and the formatting/images. Although the reactions were overwhelmingly positive, I don't feel it has yet the visibility it deserves.

Hey guys.

So yesterday, I decided that it might not be the best idea, and so instead went with this instead. These 6 champs I'm about to list aren't necessarily the best to carry games or drag yourself out of ELO hell (although they can do just that), but what they do instead is teach you the skills you'll need to know in the +1200 ELO world. So, without further ado, allow me to begin.

**1. Jarvan IV**

'80% testosterone and 20% balls of steel' - Anon.

Jarvan as a champion is like a professor. Every single time you play him, he's the most balanced champion in the game, finding the perfect point in between tankiness and damage, as well as being of a similar strength early game through late game. You have to apply yourself when you perform your EQ combo and ultimate and think about how it will affect your teammates, especially with Cataclysm. His jungle route is flexible, his clear time is decent and his ganks are in a class of their own. 

Roles: Solo top

Cost: 4800 IP

**2. Ryze**

'Ryze would have done some dirty

Typically, Frozen Heart, Banshee's Veil. That's health, armour, MR and a fuckload of mana, making you one tanky mage whilst being able to constantly churn out damage. Oh yeah, forgot to mention his passive. Every time Ryze casts a spell, meaning he throws out his spells like a god-damn machine gun. What will Ryze do for you? First, so you can basically walk right into a teamfight

Roles: Mid

Cost: 450 IP

**3. Gangplank**

'I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS' - CholeraNinja

The true jack of all trades, but he can jungle very well, function as an AD carry if necessary, support due to his buffs, slow and global ultimate, and even mid as a counterpick. His spells don't require a huge amount of skill to use well, and he'll reward every single thing you do right whilst forgiving dumb mistakes. Get CC'd, ranging from full AD carry to full tank

Roles: Whatever you want.

Cost: 3150 IP

**4. Kennen**

'BAN THAT PURPLE FUCK' - Me.

There's something about starting your name with a K and wearing purple that makes champions OP. Kennen is no exception. Strong throughout the game and strong in 3/5 roles, AD multiplier, strong AP ratios, an escape coupled with damage and a huge, fuck-off AoE that stuns and deals a bazillion damage. Typically an AP that can be played mid or solo top, people realised after IEM Kiev that AD Kennen isn't so ridiculous after all due to the stun, easy escape and AD bonus on every fifth attack. Fun to play, high damage and game-changing

Roles: Solo top

Cost: 6300 IP

**5. Soraka**

'Always heal

So you want to support? Well, only really useful for his high kill potential. Lulu: TBD. So who does that leave? Soraka and Taric. Now I'd actually made a very strong point for Taric, but then something else came to me: map awareness. As a support, map awareness is key. Most likely you'll be the only person warding, so you'll need to keep track of timers on them all. You'll need to keep an eye on the best place to dump CV, on where their jungler is ganking, and various other things. Therefore, Soraka. You can pretty much plant your face on the keyboard and heal someone for like, and Infuse silences, making you the perfect aura slave from the start

Roles: Support

Cost: 450 IP

**6. Ashe**

'BIG ARROW EVERY TIME IT HITS ITS SO LONG I CANNOT MOVE

As Ashe, which whislst it wont put you ahead by much will still help out a bit. Due to her in-built CV it opens up options for your support to run other summoner spells, namely Heal, leading to more sustain. Also, and perhaps most importantly, you get an initiate. As the main damage output for your team, you need to be able to engage in fights only when you know you've got the potential to come put on top. With her ultimate, leaving no excuse for starting a teamfight you're not gonna win. Even cooler

Roles: AD carry. Support *can* work

Cost: 450 IP

DISCLAIMERS: I DO NOT recommend AD Kennen, but there are way better choices for their role.

When laning, last hitting.

Last hitting gives you gold (and experience, instead you have to force your enemy off the minions. Basically, this is a guide on how to control minion flow and how to maximize the enemy's loss from being zoned.

First of all, but if you manage to force them out of lane, here's the basic idea of what you want to do: 

1. Check what state the lane is. Where is it pushing? Who has more minions? What are their HPs? 

2. Depending on where the lane is going to go

If the lane is pushing towards the enemy tower and the enemy is not there

If the lane is pushing towards your tower

This knowledge can also be used for clever things like kill trading: If you dive for first blood while the lane is pushed with several minion waves to the enemy turret

Utilizing this correctly is 100% needed to play at a higher level in top so you can make their top fall behind and you can snowball.

This got a lot longer than I expected it to

****
**What Is a Tank?**

Very simply, and pressuring the enemy team to focus on you instead of your carry.  Tanks are also usually responsible for initiating team fights.

**Why Should I Play a Tank?**

A **balanced team composition** will always include *at least* one tank.  This may be a ""hard"" tank (e.g. Rammus) or a character who fulfills two roles at once, and that means tanks.

**Which Stats Are Important for Tanks?**

Health Points (HP), Health Regen, and sometimes Move Speed (MS).

**Understanding Resistances**

High Armor and Magic Resist stats are the hallmark of a good tank.  You need to understand the underlying math to make good use of them.

Armor reduces incoming physical damage according to the formula:

% Received = 100/(100 + Armor)

Therefore, 50%;  at 200 Armor, 33%.  As you can see, the more Armor you have, the more it takes to improve your defenses.  In other words, we say that **Armor has diminishing returns**.  The formula is exactly the same for magic damage and MR.

Another

Effective Health = Health Points * (1 + Armor/100)

Said another way, i.e. 5250 EHP.  Again, the calculation is identical for Magic Resist.

The bottom line is that at a certain point

**Damage Types**

To be an effective tank

*Physical vs. Magic* - Every champion's auto-attack deals physical damage.  Most champion abilities deal magic damage.  You can usually count each character as one type or the other, and abilities that deal damage as a % of your total health.  Also know (and fear) characters that can deal true damage - you can't mitigate it.

*Burst vs. Sustained* - Most abilities deal a large chunk of damage immediately (burst).  Auto-attacks, but is useless against burst.

*Single-target vs. Area-of-Effect (AoE)* - As a tank, and how you might be able to intercept them.  Look for opportunities to ""catch"" incoming skill shots, but be aware that some will penetrate units (i.e. Caitlyn's Piltover Peacemaker).

**Understanding Crowd Control**

Crowd control (CC) refers to any effect that disables your opponents.  We can separate them into ""soft"" and ""hard"" (channel-interrupting) types.

*Soft* - slows, and blinds

*Hard* - taunts, stuns, knockups, displacements, and suppressions

- Make sure your team has a good amount of CC skills before you lock in - they're critical for shutting down important targets.

- Some CC is conditional

- Good positioning and Tenacity (Mercury's Treads) are your most important tools against CC

**Be the Initiator**

Most of the time, as well as gut instinct.  Here are a few tips:

- Tank first.  Squishies in back. **Stay together**.

- Look for an opening in the enemy formation and exploit it.  Choose your moment and commit to the fight.  If your initiation skill places you in the middle of them (Amumu)

- Be wary of counter-initiating skills. A Sona or Janna ult can completely turn the tables on you.

- If you're running a poke comp

**Plan Ahead!**

The best way to remain an effective tank is to stay ahead of the enemy, count the amount of CC skills, and remind yourself when each champion is strongest.  If you plan ahead, you won't fall behind.

**Example**: the enemy team is Vayne, Leblanc, and Gangplank.  Counting the CC, I see-see that Vayne has a conditional stun, Rammus has a slow and a taunt, Sona has an AoE stun, Leblanc has a silence, I know I'm going to need Mercury's Treads here.  Beyond that, Randuin's Omen

To begin, per se, people do and say stupid things out of ignorance, but I think it just comes down to maturity. Winning a game does NOT mean going 10/0, that could even be irrelevant to the matter of winning or losing. The matchmaking system is designed to setup each match with each player having an inherent 50% chance to win. Playing poorly, might not even decrease your chance of winning. You could in theory, win 3 games in a row, all on luck. Skill does not always play a part in your win/loss record.


I'm making this post to try to provide awareness of the things I have mentioned and will mention. If even 1 person takes something from this post then I will be happy. I'm not trying to trash talk, or offend anyone in any way. I'm sorry if this post hurts your feelings or your ego, I mean for this to help people. Maybe if you realize you win 5 games then lose 5 games, because you are at a point where your individual skill is average. You then, without realizing it, are banking on luck. You might win your lane, get fed and still lose the game. The next game you play, feed and still win, thanks Riot."" That is not Riot's fault


Just imagine playing against a pro. Let's be honest the average player and most, would not stand a single chance against them. When they make smurfs, do you think they struggle playing against Silver players? The same goes for a random diamond player, assuming he actually belongs in diamond and wasn't carried there. Do you think a true diamond player would struggle against a silver player? There is no point in climbing the ranks if you are a true silver player, you will just have a terrible time. The most important thing to take from this massively long post is you have to think correctly, to play accordingly. You will always have a chance to lose, regardless of how well you do.

1373564686.0,1i3ebu,Low Elo Pubstomping Supports,Imtoogoodatthisgame,31,6,63,"This is a list of supports to help low elo last pick players. Being stuck at last pick in low elo is a pain in the butt. most of the time

1. Thresh:
Ever since this soul collecting Chain Warden came out, his E which slows for 1.5 seconds and knocks back or knocks forward (depending on how you want to use it) enemy champions, and finally his ultimate, a whopping 99% slow for 2 seconds that does 250 damage plus 100% of your AP at rank one. Thresh's Q has a second activation that can be used similar to an Amumu bandage. This second activation can let you decide whether to initiate or throw down some poke. His E can be used as an engage or disengage. It is amazing for peeling someone off your team. His ult, if cast right, can create amazing kiting potential for your adc and also deals a great burst of magic damage. I havent talked about his W alot because i wanted to save the best for last. His w, a shield, will be dragged to you. The shield itself is not alot, and when Draven clicks on it, his Q has a slight cast time so people can dodge it quite easily. Also

2. Leona:
One of the most aggressive supports in the league. She can dive into the middle of the enemy team and help her team do heavy bursts of damage from her passive. She doesn't really have any potential until level 2, and also a prolonged resistance if her W hits an enemy after it pops. Her ult is an AOE stun (if enemies are caught in the center) or AOE slow (if enemies are hit by the sides). It has incredibly long range and can be used as an initiation or if you are trying to chase down someone. The bad thing about leona is that she is melee and can take heavy poke from enemy adc or support. Leona's main counter is Janna, for Janna can stop Leona's E with her tornado.

3. Sona:
Sona is a very poke heavy champ. She Q and power chord can be used as amazing burst and poke. Her passive gives her great damage on her basic attacks. She can easily bring down enemy champ a good amount of health just from her Q-&gt; powerchord combo. Sona also has a semi-spammable heal to keep her team healthy during teamfights. Sona doesn't have any cc pre-6 besides her e's powerchord(but everyone forgets about it). After 6

4. Blitzcrank:
This Great Steam Golem is used to be the number one ban in low elo. No one knew how to deal with him. No one dodged his hooks. Everyone in low elo thought he was ""op"". Recently, Blitz is still an AMAZING support and also really fun to play. His Q pulls enemies  right into him and comboed with his E can secure an easy kill. Blitzcrank solely relies on catching people out of place and turning that into a free kill. Blitzcrank's ult is probably the only thing he can offer in teamfights, besides pulling in the adc or mid laner for an easy kill. Blitz has no heals or shields for an ally, but can easily set up kills. One thing amazing about blitzcrank is his mana shield. His mana shield can be used to bait or kite enemies while your team rain damage on them. Blitz's main counter is thresh, for thresh's lantern can pull people away from your hugs.

5. Janna:
The God of all peels. Although I am not a good Janna player

6. Lulu:
The stupid Yordle. Just kidding. Lulu brings amazing poke during the laning phase from her e -&gt; q combo. The slow from your Q is great for ganks and the vision you get from your E really helps. Your e can also be a shield if cast on an ally. Your W is just an amazing form of cc. It is basically a silence and a fear all in one. Her ult gives an amazing amount health and also knocks up the enemies around it. It also gives an aoe slow around your ally cast. Lulu is also kind of squishy early game but brings alot of damage onto the table.

7. Zyra:
Zyra. Dat Plant. Zyra was first made as an ap carry, with her ult, her plants do so much damage. You wouldnt really notice it until mid team fight. Zyra is pretty squishy but her snare makes up for it. You cant get close enough to her or her adc to do damage. Also her ult is an aoe slow into a knock up that does a ton of damage. If you want a pretty easy support, Zyra is your go to. The only thing she lacks is a heal or a shield, but like I said, you can't get close enough to her.

8. Elise:
The Chinese and Koreans are doing it. So it has to be pro. I took some time to think about it. You have a stun which is a peel and also an initiate. You can also bait with your e in spider form. When the enemy team focus all their cc on you, but try not to use it as an execute but try to lower them for you adc to be an easy kill.

9. Nami:
Nom Noms. Squishy yet good. Well so is sona. The thing about nami is that her poke, her ""E"" is an amazing if you put it on an adc to help with kiting. It is sort of like a 3 hit red buff. Her stun is amazing, although it can be fairly easy to dodge, but since this is low elo, it doesnt really matter. As you carry yourself higher, players will be dodging your stuns quite easily. Her ult is just amazing, its like a shurelya's and also the slow on it is really good. The range on the ult is pretty high

10. Alistar: 
The minotaur. The old number one ban in low elo in season 2. Why? Because he is great. His Q is an amazing aoe knockup that can help save teamates or you can combo it with your e for great damage and cc. Alistar's W-&gt; Q combo is probably one of the hardest combos to land in low elo. If the WQ combo is landed, alistar's ult gives him a free cleanse, attack damage, and damage reduction. Late game, he can run into an enemy team, create huge disturbance while keeping his team health. Alistar is also really good at catching people out. My suggestion is that if you cant land the WQ combo, go for a Q, and W headbutt them back.

#Abilities

&gt; * **Rebirth** - Upon dying
−40 / −25 / −10 / +5 / +20. If the egg can survive for 6 seconds

A solid passive during almost all stages of the game. The most skilled Anivia players will rarely get egged unless they're baiting the enemies into a kill. It aids Anivia in that she's a squishy

&gt; * **Flash Frost**
&gt; ACTIVE: Anivia fires an orb of ice that travels in a line at 850-speed. All enemies it hits take magic damage and are ""chilled"" for 3 seconds, stuns them for 1 second, and ""chills"" them for 3 seconds.

Anivia's bread and butter skillshot. It's slow moving and hard to land against competent players; but for good reason. It has a ridiculous ratio and base damage


&gt; * **Crystallize**
&gt; : Anivia creates an impassible wall of ice centered on target point

This is the skill that makes Anivia so incredibly powerful in competitive (as well as solo-queue) games. You can use this ability to completly wall off areas for escape, and that's why I take a point in wall at 4. In a gank you can throw wall in the middle of the lane and use Q and hope they run to the side you aim your Q - a combo that is stronger than most expect.

&gt; * **Frostbite**
&gt; Anivia fires a shard of ice to deal magic damage to a target enemy. Frostbite deals double damage to enemies ""chilled"" by Anivia's other spells

Your main nuke! It's pretty spammable in teamfights and has good scaling. It's important to note that R-&gt; E (or E-&gt;R depending if you want to launch the E first and use R before it lands to conserve mana) works as well as Q-&gt; E. Don't be afraid to use this spell to lasthit in lane.

&gt; * **Glacial Storm**
&gt; TOGGLE: Anivia creates a blizzard in a target 800-diameter area. Enemies inside this area take magic damage over time and are ""chilled""

Very high damage

##Item build

**Once again

**UPDATE**: Liandry's torment is now almost mandatory to buy on Anivia due to the bugfix that gives the item its proper damage. Don't miss out! **


START: [](/faeriecharm) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/healthpotion) [](/manapotion) [](/sightward)

farie charm, singular ward

This is what I start in 99% of my games midlane. The charm allows you go build off into either a [], it's probably the one way that makes laning with Anivia actually extremely hard. If you're in a hard 1v1 lane like kass or fizz you should probably try to pick up the raw stat items from catalyst (ruby/sapphire) first as mana regen does absolutely nothing for you.

MIDGAME: [](/sorcerersshoeshomeguard) [](/rodofages) [](/hauntingguise) [](/tearofthegoddess)
 
sorc shoes, and Tear of the Goddess should be finished at the midgame. 

Homeguard are an optional buy. Most of the time I get them after Catalyst and get them with Sorcerer's shoes in one go. Sorc boots are generally the best on Anivia as sorc shoes are the cheapest flat pen casters can buy

LATEGAME: [](/sorcerersshoeshomeguard) [](/rodofages) [](/liandrystorment) [](/seraphsembrace) [](/voidstaff) LAST SLOT SITUATIONAL. 

Late game important items: Sorc Shoes, Seraph's, Void Staff 

(Sorcs can be substituted for merc post-void) The last slot is situational for my 6 item build because there are too many good options for Anivia when it comes to the last choice. You could go [](/zhonyashourglass) zhonya

SITUATIONAL: [](/abyssalscepter) abyssal [](/guardianangel), [](/bansheesveil) bveil [](/spiritofthespectralwraith) spirit of the spectral wraith  [](/morellonomicon) or morellonomicon

These items are all based around countering certain things. Abyssal is what you need to build if you end up buying a negatron against [](/leblanc) and don't feel like you want a Veil, banshee's against veigar or kassadin, etc. Morellonomicon is an undervalued item that is great against heavily sustaining midlanes like vlad or swain as it's hard to all-in them without ignite. The spectral item I tried because Scarra was building it and it's not a bad replacement for catalyst if you're in a heavy farm lane like Karthus who will outscale you damagewise if you don't farm up like hell. 
*****
##Itemization Explanation

The reason I build the way I do is because [](/anivia) needs a vast mana pool to output constant DPS in teamfights. [](/athenesunholygrail) is a great item on her

The good thing about Anivia is that she scales far better off of penetration and the mana-items than most AP casters. [](/rabadonsdeathcap) isn't mandatory on Anivia! Once you have the late-game core of [](/liandrystorment), [](/voidstaff), and [](/sorcerersshoes) you output a very high amount of damage to all targets due to your high base damage and AOE spells. I recommend building Void over Deathcap in most games unless you're snowballing super hard and can buy deathcap after RoA. Deathcap is extremely expensive and in most games you won't be able to finish it if you opt for [](/liandrystorment) first due to the high cost of deathcap. If you don't have [](/voidstaff) after 

*****
##Summoner Spells

[](/flash)[](/ignite) or [](/flash)[](/teleport) or [](/flash)[](/barrier). Generally you want to use the first set for lane aggression as Anivia can catch many laners off-guard with her Q-E early game and with flash + snowflake auto and ignite you can easily secure a kill in lane. You CAN take TP as well and do fine but I advise taking ignite in almost every matchup once you have played enough Anivia.

EDIT: After experimenting with the spell more


*****

##Laning

From 1-6 Anivia's matchups range from incredibly aggressive to passive as can be. It's important to look at the enemy jungle pick and determine how aggressive you're able to be against your lane 1v1. If they have massive early pressure [](/

Versus melee assassins like [](/akali) or [](/diana) you should be autoing them every time they go for a CS to pressure them and make them burn potions. Make sure you don't auto him standing in his creepwave

Versus standard caster lanes

Once you hit 6 Anivia has a tremendous power spike as you can reliably land your E's double damage due to Glacial Storm. This is when you should start being aggressive (assuming you have coverage with [](/sightward)). Constantly land E -&gt; R's on your opponent. Once you have them at ~50-60% throw down your Crystallize and try to land Flash Frost followed by Frostbite for the kill. Once this technique is mastered you'll be able to reliably force flash from your enemies.

# Runes

(Standard Page)

&gt; 9x MPen Red

&gt; 9x HP@18

&gt; 9x MagicResist Blues 

&gt; 3x MoveSpeed Quints 

(Melee-Abuse Page) (for Akali, Fizz, etc)

&gt; 9x HybridPen Red

&gt; 9x Armor Yellow

&gt; 9x MR Blue

&gt; 3x HybridPen Quints

The first page is standard. Anivia needs MS quints to perform her kiting-esque role properly. She also has ridiculously low base values in everything due to her egg and strong kit. You don't need AP in blues nor quints as Anivia has very high base damages. Yellows are preferential

With the season3 nerfs to flat armorpen and flat magicpen runes, etc and certain niche mid-lane matchups they are very effective. I find with the 2nd page I can usually earn firstblood in the first few minutes against melee champs. 
*****
#Masteries

Standard 21-0-9 page for casters in most matchups against other ranged casters.

http://i.imgur.com/ZiK4zmN.jpg

 take 21-0-9 again versus AD casters and melee AP assassins but I spec into the AD in the offense tree and take spellblade. This is the mastery set I would use with the Hybrid Penetration runeset.

http://i.imgur.com/JBwj0bU.jpg

*****
##Teamfighting

Teamfighting with Anivia is probably the hardest aspect of her kit but also the strongest. In the words of Morello

Focus firstof on making sure that you are positioned properly to deal constant damage throughout the fight. The biggest mistake at lower elo ranges is that people try too hard to tunnel the carries on champions not designed to do so (see: other carries). Positioning is extremely important on Anivia as if you're CC'd the first second you start your ult your damage will plummet. 

After you are set with your positioning, focus first on stunning as many as possible with Flash Frost and using your wall **AFTER** the other team has blown their escapes/ and [](/flash) spells. 

After the initial followup to whichever initiate, focus on peeling the bruisers off of your AD with your ultimate and flash frost. If the other AD is vastly stronger, try to see if you can land your enhanced nuke on them. Once you're farmed, a double Q and E should be enough to 90% most AD carries unless it's a 60minute game. Don't be afraid to leave your R channeling for long times in teamfights if you have [](/bluebuff)
*****
##Moving around the Map

I figured I should write a section about this, when coordinated, can easily destroy a solo-queue game through the shared control of the objectives on the map, whether that be  [](/redbuff),  [](/bluebuff),  [](/dragon), or towers. 

The mid should always be the one following the jungler's leads and pings in a solo-queue scenario. Ever since the Season 3 mega-patch, ganks, and early bids for objectives. The point being: **LISTEN TO THE JUNGLER WHEN HE PINGS YOU TO COME, IF YOU START SNOWBALLING AND ELIMINATING THE OTHER JUNGLER, YOU START TO CONTROL THE BUFFS AND CONTROLLING THE BUFFS IS THE SECRET TO SOLO QUEUE!**

#CHAMPION SYNERGIES AND MATCHUPS -

[](/amumu) - Notable for his awesome AOE ulti as well as his early pressure. 2 stuns in mid lane is an easy first blood if all skills land! It's hard to play against amumu because he has so much CC to keep you locked up. Don't use your R until he blows his if he's saving it for you -- his R WILL cancel a lot of your damage-

[](/ahri) - One of the harder mid-lane matchups for Anivia. She has kill potential on you at 6 but it's still definitely a skill matchup. She's incredibly squishy so you can kill her 1-5 as well as after 6 depending on how solid your mechanics are. Don't throw out your stun to farm or she can easily go aggressive on you. Ahri's cooldowns are low enough that she can kill your egg fairly quickly.

[](/akali) - Medium/Hard matchup

[](/alistar) - A great support pick against and with [](/Anivia). His high amounts of CC disrupt her damage and can also be used to lock-down a target if he's on the same team with Anivia.

[](/annie) - A champion that is seldom picked

[](/ashe) - Great initiate

[](/blitzcrank) - Anivia is slow and squishy

[](/brand) - Skill matchup

[](/cassiopeia) - Hard

[](/chogath) - Super obnoxious lane. You have no kill potential on him due to his sustain

[](/diana) - Easy matchup

[](/elise) - Previously a tough matchup due to Elise's Rappel mechanic making landing your Q hard. After the nerfs she's not as tough though. You can stay out of range easily. 

[](/evelynn) - You can poke her pretty easily and get an advantage through that. You push hard enough to punish her roam later so it's not a bad lane. Similar to TF in the sense that she's not looking to kill you 1v1

[](/gragas) - Hard matchup. Anivia is slow and squishy and gragas has high AD from his W to kill your egg and enough sustain to deal with your poke.

[](/kassadin) - Hard lane

[](/fizz) - really annoying

1369942058.0,1fcsuh,Composition Analysis: Next Level Solo Queing,BlueNoseReindeer,32,7,5,"I posted this yesterday on the main League Reddit

Hi guys, no sitting around. Well, here is something I started doing while I was mid-Gold that helped me get going on the game during the loadscreen.

If you don't know much about team comps

As a side note, if you CAN play a champion that fits better into your team's comp, try to do so. Some champions (i.e. Sona) fit comfortably into any comp.

Okay, I look at their comp, and then our comp. Usually their is some sort of unity to it (if they have an Amumu, they probably have MF, Karthus, or Sona). No comp (that I've ever seen) is one dimensional. For example, Amumu is easily recognized as having strong AOE, and can peel well if needed. That being said, Sona

The first step is to determine what class of comp each team has 1:unified 2:functional 3: disorganized. A unified comp would be one where everyone is trying to do the same thing (like the AOE dive comp listed above). A functional comp might have 3-4 people doing the same thing, take Jarvan out of the example comp and sub in Shen. Shen can splitpush and ult back to create the 4v5s he is know for, and can plausibly get off his taunt on several people, so he still works very well with the comp. The same could be done with TF in place of Karthus, also splitpushing, and using his semi-AOE in teamfights he can quickly rejoin. A disorganized comp could be Taric, Caitlyn, Elise

If a team does not have an organized comp, while still playing your comp as strongly as possible. I made the following guide for myself when considering team comps (don't take it too seriously, it's more like a rule of thumb):

AOE&gt; Dive, they clump, making is easy to get the AOE off on everyone. In order to peel for a hyper carry, you have to be close to them, which makes it easy to get AOEs off on everyone, including the hyper carry.)

Splitpush&gt; AOE, they can't chain off their AOE abilities, nor can the hyper carry get the peel they need).

Dive&gt; Poke, and so if a team is divided by their splitpush, the divers can force 1v1 fights that they will muscle their way through.

Poke&gt; AOE, giving them more and more time to get poke off. Splitpushing takes time to get towers, giving more time to get poke off, just keep waveclearing and again, you can poke indefinitely)

Peel&gt; Poke, shields/heals can mitigate poke substantially. Peelers are good at pulling off divers, mitigating their damage, CCing them when they dive, etc.)

Again, but could theoretically fit all 5 (Sona, Morgana, Nautilus, Vlad, Caitlin), there are a lot of variables to consider when analyzing comps.

1369778653.0,1f878d,League Class with RollinHard - Junglers 101,TrollThatDude,32,6,7,"**Important message // I beg you guys


Hi guys! My IGN is RollinHard and I'm a gold rated player. I believe that my game knowledge is pretty good while my mechanics are bronze level (if not below that). 

**Anyways

I want to help out as much as I can with making these begginer guides here on summoner school. I will share the knowledge and the whole theory behind things I understand, teach him how to fish and he will eat for hos entire life. This is what I want to do here so let's get started!


 * First of all, Gank heavy - Farm Heavy, Objective Control - Not, Carry - Supporty.

For example, can have great ganks if you land Rupture's, has great objective control with ult, not mana reliant so you can donate your blue to mid AND has free stats.

Shyvana, she has an amazing clear time, great mobility around the map, no mana, low CD ult, good damage, potent duelist

**But RollinHard

*Well

 * How many times have you seen a jungler fail? All of these times, you must first ask yourself some questions;

1. What should I pick here ; Does your team need ganks, damage? Going in champion select and picking without thinking is a big handicap. How can a top lane Gangplank with a jungle Shyvana ever get a kill vs Zed? Guess what. They can't. But Zed can because his jungler is Maokai or Skarner or Alistar. When picking a jungler, watch your lanes first. If your bot lane is Graves-Sona and you want to snowball that lane, dont pick a heavy damage jungler without CC, pick something with strong CC pre-6. This way, you can gank even before Sona gets her Creshendo, snowballing Graves and giving your team a huge lead.

2. On the other side, Ashe and Taric/Alistar? You already have great CC in all lanes, better get that jungle Nocturne you want to play so much, get fed and deal damage. In a tourney, TSM once picked Shyvana jungle and Jayce top. Guess what, they just couldnt gnak top lane since all SHyvana had was exaust and its on a realy high cooldown.


 * Play according to your junglers powers. This is pretty straight forward ;
1.  When playing jungle Shyvana or Malphite, you will probably lose your time. 
1. On the other hand, you dont realy need it (Maokai doesnt need farm, Shaco needs so much, he cant realy get it from farming, only kills and a ton of split pushing). Unless you get good ganks with Shaco in the first levels, you will be super useless lategame, so do your best and gank non stop in early levels.
1.  Nunu is another of my favoutites this days. People always said that he is extremely strong early game. I couldn't understand it for a long time, you just cant try to clear your buffs because he can steal them, snowball you and run away and generaly not kill you, but win you the hard way. He can also do a realy quick drake, you can pull of a 5 minute drake with just your mid laner in soloQ, which is a realy good chunk of early game money for your entire team. If you dont win the enemy jungler hard with Nunu via stealing at least 1 of his buffs or dont get a realy early drake, later you become a moving bloodboil

 * Almost all lanes are gankable, you have the river gank, the lane gank and the tribrush gank. Unless the enemy wards all 3 entrances to his lane, which **NOONE does and I realy mean NOONE**, as long as you are able to figure out which path is not warded you can probably gank him. A tip here is to always use the lane gank when in doubt. Most people will ward the river brush in top lane, some of them will ward the tribrush, almost noone will ward the lane brush. Its the gank that will solve your problems most of the time. Also, try to go the long way through the enemies jungle


**Anyways, I suck hard at formating ;.;**

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/ashe ""Ashe"") **Ashe

Best kiting champion in the game. One of the best initiate abilities there is. Decent damage with incredibly good sustained DPS over the course of a fight. One of the single best carries to learn positioning with because she's autoattack dependent rather than ability dependent. Best champion to learn to kite with as well as chase with thanks to her infinite slow.

Masteries: 21/0/9

Runes: 9x flat AD reds, 3x flat AD quints. Standard AD to prioritize last hitting, taking as little harass as possible, and having better MR for lategame.

Summoners: [](/flash) and any of: [](/heal)

* [](/cleanse) is great to have against a heavy CC team
* [](/ghost) is awesome for a second escape and even better kiting than Ashe's typically extraordinary ability to do so. 
* [](/heal) for baits and staying alive. 

Skill order: WQWEWR or WEWQWR, E for vision. 

Item build: [](/bootsofspeed) + 3x [](/healthpotion) -&gt; 2x [](/doransblade) / [](/berserkersgreaves) / [](/vampiricscepter) -&gt; [](/bfsword) -&gt; [](/zeal) -&gt; [](/infinityedge) -&gt; [](/phantomdancer) -&gt; [](/thebloodthirster) / [](/lastwhisper) / defensive. [](/thebloodthirster) if the opposing team isn't building armor, you can go [](/guardianangel) instead of [](/quicksilversash). I like building [](/zeal) before completing my [](/infinityedge) because the added attack speed combined with Q is really nice for any fight you might run into, as well as letting you chase better. Also this helps proc your [](/vampiricscepter) more for greater life steal in case you're in need of that earlier on.

General tips:

* Try to catch someone important with your arrow if at all possible. It's not going to be very helpful to your team to hit that Mundo with it. I know, try to make the best of your ability to aim skillshots.

* When in fights

* Remember your hawkshot. Doing dragon and don't have vision of the entrance to river from their wraiths? Hawkshot it. It's a very handy tool for giving vision while going for any objective or if you feel the need to check an area. Just be careful since it's on a minute-long cooldown

* In lane, but Q is capable of making you incredibly frustrating to lane against since you're so hard to run away from.

Sona is a champion whose early game poke through her Hymn of Valor + Power Chord makes her a very potent support. She is pretty frail

MASTERIES

0/9/21, you could move the 9 defense into 9 offense, and get the 10% magic penetration.

RUNES

Most Sona players like to go with a standard mpen Mark Armor Seal Magic Resist Glyph and GP10 quintessences, armor yellows, and AP glyphs/Quintessences.

SUMMONER SPELLS

[](/flash)  
[](/exhaust)[](/clairvoyance)[](/heal)

Flash is because you need to position yourself to get the crescendo off.

Exhaust is to secure kills for your AD carry

Clairvoyance is if you don't feel like you can get kills

Heal is if you don't want to be effective in killing

Most of the time, how her W can keep carries topped off in a lane, and the inability from E to boost the speed of her carry enough. The power chord-enhanced E does not improve with level, so only one point will do.

Which one you level up first depends on the lane you're up against. If its something along the lines of a kill lane (Corki Leona)

ITEM BUILD

[](/faeriecharm)[](/sightward)**x4**[](/healthpotion)

You want to be able to ward up and get off those Qs. try to only go back once you can finish off your philo stone and pick up a few wards as well.

CORE BUILD

[](/philosophersstone)[](/heartofgold)[](/ionianbootsoflucidity)OR[](/bootsofmobility).

The logic behind this is that you want to be able to increase your gold income without csing, boots of mobility is the best option. If you don't feel like you're that far ahead, Boots of Lucidity are another option.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS

[](/shurelyasreverie)  - Builds out of Philosopher's Stone
[](/aegisofthelegion)  - Great item and super cost effective. If your jungler isn't building this
[](/locketoftheironsolari)  - Builds out of Heart of Gold
[](/randuinsomen)  - Builds out of Heart of Gold
[](/zekesherald)  - Great item. Gives you CDR

-how do I deal with a tanky opponent that can kill me under a tower?
I love to play as nidalee


-jungling seems a very important aspect of the game however at the moment confuses the crap out of me. How does a jungler know which mobs to kill and when they have respawned? 

Also why are runes so crucial for a jungler?

Lastly

-what determines the lane a champ should play in? I can only determine what lane I should be in when playing a new champion if I look up guides first however I'm unsure WHY I should be in that specific lane.

-when buying items I tend to follow a guide and buy the same items each game

-I can often be having a great game in my lane and find another lane is being pushed back and struggling. When I go to help I've lost towers in my own lane. How can I prevent this?

-As I mentioned earlier I love playing nidalee. Any general tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1367435031.0,1dhyvu,Daily LeagueTheoryCraft 101 #1. Trundle The Troll King,Slicksa,30,8,10,"Hi guys today were gonna be theory crafting on our newly re-imagined champion [](/trundle) Trundle The Troll King.

With the tweaks to his kit our favorite troll has become an extremely strong pick for both the top lane and the jungle. His kit revolves around being able to drain the strength of his enemies and becoming a monster during teamfights. He excels at peeling for your squishy allies or just diving in with increased resistances to beat down their their carries. So lets look closely at his skills

King's TributeRANGE: 1000

Whenever an enemy unit near Trundle dies

A passive that doesn't really show much effectiveness but is still nice to have as it will help keep you alive during the laning phase or when your jungling. It may not show instant result but over time its very useful.

Q-Chomp COOLDOWN: 4COST: 30 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle enhances his next basic attack
This attack increases Trundle's attack damage for 8 seconds
PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+ 100 / 105 / 110 / 115 / 120% AD)
ATTACK DAMAGE BONUS: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40

As you can see Trundle's Q is a massive boost to your damage while taking AD away from them. The small slow on it is also a nice touch. With the prevalence of AD assasins such as **Kha'zix** and **Zed** the AD drain can be pretty helpful. Note the scaling AD ratio not bonus AD on this skill it allows you to raise your damage by quite a bit without building too much AD. It also makes him a great duelist as he will usually outdamage and outlive most matchups. **IMPORTANT** This is an auto attack reset so you can basically hit your opponent twice in one attack.

W-Frozen Kingdom RANGE: 900 COOLDOWN: 15 COST: 60 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle coats a target 1000-radius location with ice for 8 seconds, and increased healing and regeneration from all sources while he is on it.
MOVEMENT SPEED: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40%
ATTACK SPEED: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80%
HEALING AND REGENERATION INCREASE: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20% 

I really like his W as it has a lot of what Trundle needs in a fight: MS

E-Pillar of Ice RANGE: 1000 COOLDOWN: 23 / 20 / 17 / 14 / 11 COST: 60 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle creates an icy pillar at a target location for 6 seconds
The pillar blocks movement within 62.5 range
SLOW: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%

One of the few skills that create impassible terrain in the game there is a reason that skills like this is few and far between as with proper use it can just destroy your opponents positioning and disrupt the enemy team with the pillar itself and the slow. Multipurpose as it can be used to split enemy divers from your carry with the pillar or use it for ganks and trap people in between the pillar and a wall. Its effectiveness increases with the less space the opponent has at it can block off jungle entrances and exit. A very strong skill that needs quick thinking and great decision making to maximize its effectiveness. 1000 range is pretty huge as well u can place it from one end of your Frozen Kingdom to the other.

R-Subjugate RANGE: 700 COOLDOWN: 80 / 70 / 60 COST: 75 mana

ACTIVE: Trundle drains a percentage of an enemy champion's health as magic damage and 40% of their armor and magic resist
INITIAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 10 / 12 / 14% (+ 1% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health
TOTAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 24 / 28% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health

Trundles ultimate Subjugate is an incredibly amazing skill with its draining of enemy health and resistances. See that Jax trying to dive into your carry BLAM now he has 20% less resistances then even more over 4 seconds making him so squishy that your carry should be able to take care of him easily. With increased resists you can then go into a team fight extremely beefy with your Q and W you will be outputting a large amount of damage making you a massive target for the enemy team. 

**Trundle in the Jungle**
Trundle now has higher sustain in the jungle with Frozen Kingdom if a creep dies while you have it up. His ganks are as strong as always with that Pillar of Ice and Frozen Kingdom preventing them from getting away. Trundle can be very strong as well even if you can't get too many ganks in as he needs very few items to be effective as he scales with his enemies as well. In my opinion one thing that Trundle excels at is counter ganks by splitting up their champions with his E taking their diver's health and resistances with his R while stealing their AD with his Q Chomp. Proper set up and vision will allow Trundle to be ready to wreck any aggression from the enemy.

**Trolling in Top Lane**
Trundle is very viable in the top lane right now

**Tribute to The King
So what to buy on Trundle? Tanky or DPs? Trundle's ability to scale with his opponents allow him some lee way in what he should be building. As this is more of a theorycraft rather than a guide I'll point out more choice items.Some good items that should be considered are: 1. Blade of the Ruined King: This gives many stats that Trundle needs lifesteal

**King of Clubs**
What to do during teamfights is what I see even before his rework many Trundle players fail to see. There are 3 main things that he can do. Peel

**Winter and Trolling is Coming**
So overall I see Trundle being an extremely strong champion that will be an extremely powerful pick and could maybe see him in the pro scene very soon if they ever decide to change from their champion pool of 20-25 champs out of a 100+. He can wreck the prevalent AD assassin meta as well as the brutal bruiser champions that ruin the ADC's power. He is a viable champion in both the jungle and top lane however he will lose to ranged champions if he can't be aggressive. His gap closer suffers similarly to Skarner's gap closer in that its not a sudden movement and can be seen and prepared for. Many items that are popular are also very fitting to his kit and play style and overall he fits very well into the game. Look to pick up Trundle if u want a champion that can **Peel,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,trundle,default,t3_1dhyvu

I know OF things to do with condemn and flash but haven't mastered them. Obviously flash-condemn but what about condemn flash? I guess it does something nuts to condemn and the condemn bolt goes faster and a different direction? 

What about some kind of tumble condemn flash combo? 

I can't even imagine mixing my condemn into ult tumble flash crazy bonkers shit... Just teach me.


EDIT:

**Compiled list of *DropDizzle's* info/tips**

* Everyone who plays Vayne needs to learn this as a basic move: AA and when the bolt leaves her bow

* By wall, or just to disengage. Try this next time you are dove under tower.

* Condemn auto-attack. When condemn is finished casting and moving towards the enemy

* Flash-condemn to gap close and secure a stun against wall when they over extend. After the stun is over you are already nearby and if they flash to escape you're Vayne

* UNTESTED:  Condemn-flashing. This technique is very hard and requires precise timing. Immediately after casting condemn, without warning, can be used even if the enemy becomes hidden when you flash, and finishes quicker.

* I use Lifesteal Quints because that extra 6% is on average another 20-50 health gained per auto from mid-game on. (~250 AD

* Secure a win against MF or Draven by going 9/21 in masteries and starting cloth 5

* Don't be afraid to use flash to dodge a skillshot CC

* THE ABSOLUTE BEST ADVICE I WAS EVER GIVEN THAT TURNED MY VAYNE PLAYING AROUND: ""Get in there, gotta stay alive"" and overall backing out at half health. Now, If i have &gt;300 hp I'm fighting (depending on how bursty gap closing the team is)

* In teamfights, and run up to auto range, then tumble backwards again. Use this when the enemy has gap closers and your team has little CC. It has a psychological effect on the enemy, making them think you're further than you really are.

* In teamfights, ult slightly late, about 3-4 seconds after initiation, giving you time to finish off the tank, and still chase down the rest of the team.

* Extended trading in lane can bait people into thinking they are going to kill you. Use AA-AA-Q(AA), Graves misses a buckshot, Corki Q is down, or any time the enemy fails at landing their damage skills/passives.

So the friend who helped me learn how to play really stressed the importance of high cs. He even made a point of breaking it down and showing that being ahead by 30 cs = being head by 2 kills. When we started really playing together he would play AD and I would support. It was not uncommon after lane phase ended for me to see him take cs from every lane. He would normally be in team fights

This didn't really bother me until I started playing rolls besides support. I started with AP carry and it was really annoying when we should show up into a lane and I would do something like drop Morgana pool to clear them. He would wait for a few seconds till they were all low health and then take them all. The result of this was me always being a bit under farmed while he was always very well farmed. The situation continued to get worse when I started jungling and I noticed how much he would take high yield creeps. I don't just mean taking wraiths while he was playing mid

As I have gotten better and actually been able to perform quite well in games (and even carry a couple

This has obviously infuriated my friend. He has actually raged ""get the fuck out my lane"" when I wait for him to volley a large creep wave then finish them all off myself (this is obviously in a situation where we need to push the lane a bit so minions are not on our tower

I am really curious to get input from others. I have started solo queuing a bit more and don't want people raging at me because I ""stole farm"" the whole game

TL;DR CS

EDIT: To be perfectly clear this question is NOT about lane phase. Obviously you should not show up in another persons lane and take cs. I am talking about when as a group you are pushing a lane. Should you hold your abilities and make an effort to get EVERY cs (and not push the lane as quickly) or just push hard and who gets the cs gets it. Keep in mind....in this situation the goal is to take a tower/push a lane so the enemy cannot take a tower w/o building up a wave.

1340257179.0,vdb4p,Are they As Good As they Seem: Irelia,Philosiphicator,28,5,12,"I was thinking that this sort of thread might be used to highlight some of the pros and cons about a champion

**Please note: I am not ranked. I do not have an ELO score. I am by no means the best person on this subreddit to do this. Anyone else who feels they can do a better job, I will try to prune them out. If you really want to see what is going on,  check out the posts below.** With that out of the way, let's begin.

Irelia: My favorite lich. Also, a gap closer that can have an instant CD, a slow/stun based off of *percentage health* that can hurt, an ultimate that can keep you alive in a team fight where you are focused or to help heal while pushing that minion wave, and what might be the biggest boon to her: a passive that reduces **ALL** CC depending on the number of enemy champs near her.

Irelia is designed to be a Carry-Killer, gap closing, and survivability, which means that you, as Irelia, are expected to wade into the team fight, target their carry, assassins are all about the instant burst damage, but those of you who have played against an Irelia that is even moderately geared is a serious threat that should be addressed quickly. Again

Starting with her passive: If they CC you, though the stun at the end of any of them will be reduced, the knock itself will remain unaffected. Even fast with other enemy champs visible. This means that Morgana's stun, Lux's snare, Soraka's silence, all of it, are reduced in effectiveness, this passive along with a pair of merc treads means their CC means very little to you. You would be stunned for all of .78 seconds

Q: Her gap closer. Irelia will jump to the target, or Sheen, and is a great way to escape if the need arises. The damage on this skill scales well with her AD (1:1 ratio), so this skill can hurt, especially on champs that are generally flimsy such as Ashe or Cassiopeia. However, for having such a nice little list of benefits to it, it has a fairly long CD until the higher levels. UNLESS! If you score the kill with this skill, this skill could be spammed as long as the skill is the killing blow to whatever the target is

W: Her passive, and ultimately gives her beautiful sustain. Have you taken some damage from minions? Attack them, you will will heal for every attack. Attacking a tower? Same thing: towers will only make you stronger (but don't STAY under a tower if there is danger nearby, that would be stupid). And the active on this skill is very nice: it doubles the amount the passive heals (so 5/7/9/11/13 becomes 10/14/18/22/26), and adds flat true damage (15/30/45/60/75). One should always use this skill before they use their Q so that the Q applies the on-hit affects of the W (heal and true damage). This skill should be used when attacking your target (be it tower or champ), or for sustain when you don't quite need to recall and there is a handy minion wave nearby. Either way, the true damage will really come in handy (think of it like this: at level 5, the skill that every one knows her for. This is also the skill that had been nerfed, but will be well worth it trading blows in lane or attacking your target. **When attacking your target

E: The stun/slow. This skill is the odd-skill-out as it does magic damge based on your AP rather than physical damage based on your AD. But other than that weird little attribute, then you will stun them. Otherwise, they will be slowed by 60%. That's quite the slow. This skill is also expensive in terms of mana, so don't just be willy-nilly using it on everything. Also, it might sound weird, but don't be afraid to let them hit you first for the sole purpose of stunning them. Of course, try not to be killed, use caution/reason/common sense when letting them hit you. Also useful when chasing down escaping champs for obvious reasons (they will either be stunned or slowed).

R: Machine Gun Knives, is actually a very nice skill. What it does is deal AD/AP damage to all targets it hits (160 + .5 AP + .6 AD), and heals her for damage done (10% life steal from minions, 25% from champs) **each target hit**.  This skill is a pass-through linear skill shot pointing in the direction of the cursor, with Irelia as the anchor point. You point your cursor somewhere, push R, a blade goes flying in that direction and will not stop nor have reduced damage. The one real downside? It does not proc on-hit. Bummer, though picking off hurting champs that are running away is not a bad use either if it nets you the kill. The skill costs 100 mana, more damaging skills (E, this skill is like your W: deals nice damage

Unfortunately

As for how to build Irelia, or the main damage comes from AP, build against AP. Same for AD. Note, however, that if the team is balanced in how the AP/AD threat comes from, build according to the most dangerous champ on the field. Teemo's the biggest threat? Build against him. You have AP Kayle? You know what to do. You have a Tryndamere and a Lux that just hurt? Decide who is the bigger threat to your team and let them have it (be careful with Tryn though as he has Undying Rage = No Death, and may be built for tons of Life Steal. Actually, though).

Irelia is very item dependent. You should not be too aggressive in lane, though I will finish offense first. Meaning, it would be more acceptable to be lacking in offense than in defense, though you really should have farmed enough to stay relevant, if you will. You should always be a serious threat to the carries, if for no other reason than that you can reach them, slow/stun them, though you should be doing the killing yourself at that point.

If you fall behind somehow, each game is different.

Also, but don't break the build for them as they really aren't all that worth it otherwise. A heart of gold isn't bad, nor is a philosopher's stone, but...just remember, those items only sell for half value instead of three-quarter value.

Counters: Unfortunately, especially here, /r/summonerschool

Note: Some people would argue that Irelia is still overpowered. I don't think so. Irelia is so item dependent that if you can keep her from getting her items, but that does **NOT** mean that she is overpowered. Similarly powerful is Teemo. A Teemo in a match-up means that the game will be hard, if the Teemo is decently skilled with that champ. He is all about the damage, like Twitch or Veigar, and that poison will get you. He is designed to be that way. And Teemo's flaw is that he is incredibly squishy. If he is kept in the open in a teamfight, there will be a nice soot stain where a Teemo used to be. Basically: A built Irelia is a happy Irelia. A starved Irelia is pathetic.

1333863568.0,ryx95,The Cliff Notes: Counter-jungling.,,27,3,12,"THE LINKS ARE BACK

So, camp stealing and Lv. 1 invades.

**Buff stealing.**

Now most of you should know that there are two neutral buffs in each jungle. These are the blue (golem) buff, which gives you a slow on your autoattacks and a small DoT. These buffs are used for totally different things, with the red buff usually going to the jungler to aid in ganking whilst the second blue goes to the AP mid. But uses aside, they're both very valuable, and should be hung on to at all costs. But, even more rewarding is stealing the buffs in the enemy jungle, because not only does it give you the buff, denies the enemy their buff. 

So, I'm gonna cover in the 'Lv. 1 invades' section, but the buff that they started at will come up for the second time at roughly 7:20, and again at around 13:30. If you keep the timer on it, there's more of a chance that you'll be able to contest it and hopefully steal it. 

When should you steal buffs? Well, or a jungler like Olaf, Yi or Fizz, do your very best to steal it as they're all quite reliant on having that mana regen.

**Camp stealing**

In the current jungle, big golem), so stealing these can really hurt the opposing jungler. Juiciest of all is the big wraith as its located closest to your jungle and has the least health out of all the large creeps. If you have a gap-closer or any ability capable of jumping over walls, performing this steal can be quite easy as the wall between wraiths and the river is jumpable by most skills.

**Lv. 1 invades**

The level one invade to contest their first buff can be greatly beneficial to your team whilst being just as detrimental to them. However

First, its great to have CC and a lot of early game damage. Janna is a very potent champion to invade with due to her tornado, Shyvana and Riven can put out a lot of damage, and Cass's output can be huge. Now, you should probably look at their jungler too to see what buff they are more reliant on. Amumu, for example, is a very common jungler, however

Think that's it. On another note

www.rakalakalili.com

Hi guys! You may have seen my posts about my lessons the last few days

I've gotten a lot of positive feedback about what I'm doing

I'll update the home section blog with my plans for streaming sessions and random thoughts. Some things to look forward to soon:

1) Guides! I'm planning on writing guides about things like: landing skillshots, etc Look for them soon.

2) Replay organization! I think right now I'm going to have a link to a google doc file that lists all the replays, champion, position, and a link to the replay. So down the line, when I have something like 100 replays (I hope that happens :D), you can use that spreadsheet to sort for high elo mid games, or low elo kassadin games, etc. I think this is going to be the easiest way to do that.

If you've been a fan of my videos so far, subscribe on own3d, and help me improve by giving me some feedback about what I can do better!

Thanks a lot

Truth is, you lose the freedom to venture out and ward all the spots you normally would. Why is this? Simply because you are not as safe as before. Everyone has experienced trying to venture out and ward only to get completely wrecked. 

So here's my short piece of advice: when behind, ward something. Even if you literally cannot walk outside the steps of your base, drop a ward over each of the big walls of the base.

**Backing Off**
 
One very common mistake that I see a lot when watching Lower ELO gameplay is that players do not know when to back off after:
 
 * Securing objectives,  Enemy Inhibitors

&gt; Reasoning: After taking these objectives, so the most ideal moment is to back off, take your advantage and work from that. Gree will get you killed and you will lose your advantage if that happens. This is most prevalent after taking an enemy Inhibitor, for you are generally low on HP and if the enemy respawns in time, he/she'll have full HP to take your out and essentially clean-up.
 
 * Teamfights

&gt; Reasoning: Although very situational, i.e. No Ace was given, you should back off at that time. Use the advantage of a downed person to secure other objectives. 
 
 * Pushing lanes:

&gt; Reasoning: Again
 
 * If an ally gets caught and dies.

&gt; Reasoning: Obvious one

Hope you guys enjoyed today's mini-guide, so hope you all are ready for that!

* A gank is not only successful if there is a kill -- If The jungler comes in
* Every time a jungler comes and waits for a gank that jungler is missing out on farm-- so when they leave, understand they are just trying to stay in the game
* Make sure you know where your jungler is before you ask for a gank-- If the jungler is close, make sure you give them time to get to you
* If your lane opponents use their summoners/ults
* if you use your summoners/ults
* If you are losing lane a little bit
* If your lane is BADLY lost
* if you get ahead feel free to roam and gank yourself-- just let your jungler know so you can coordinate ganks or he can farm your lane.
* If your jungler just walks into lane

* LAST BUT NOT LEAST if your jungler pings for a gank, that way no time is wasted and terrible ganks can be averted

1360879333.0,18jiv0,A bit of support advice regarding warding in the early game:,MedalsNScars,28,4,3,"There are 4 key spots to ward in the early game:

1. Blue side tri-brush

2. Dragon

3+4. Both lane brushes

Typically you'll want to ward based on how pushed the lane is.

For blue side:

If you're at your turret have wards at Tri brush and near lane brush.

If you're mid-lane, and on dragon.

If you're pushed to their turret, try to get the entrance to your jungle near mid warded. If you just have tri warded you won't have time to react to ganks from it.

Purple side:

At your turret

Mid way, tri.

At their turret

Now that the basic locations of ideal wards are

1. If they have a support that harasses (Zyra, don't waste your pink on it. Wait until they re-ward and clear that out.

2. If your opponent pinks a strategic location (tri

3. If you have a pink and a sightstone and your opponent has a pink, you just made them waste a pink, since you can now clear it.

Disclaimer: The above trick doesn't work if they have it warded and are attentive enough to see that you didn't ward. A way around this is to stand in one spot for about 3 to 5 seconds. If you had warded where you were standing they wouldn't be able to see it behind your icon.

That's about all I can think of right now for early game warding. Mid-late game warding gets a lot more complicated based on generally how the game is going,False,self,t5_2t9x3,False,,,t3_18jiv0

1355444657.0,14tcvd,How to get a succesfull gank in your own lane and help your jungler set up the kill!,Rastamus,28,4,7,"Hello there, and make him go all in when in fact you are just baiting him. This means you want to do these things in the mindset of the enemy

- Tell your jungler when he can gank and get a kill

This means that you should do some preparation to before the gank. a shyvana forexample wont be able to gank mid lane very well if the lane is pushed towards their tower. So what you need to do is to make sure the lane is in a proper spot

1 - by shoving fast(anivia, and their minions will start moving towards your side  of the map, opening them up for a gank. It may take a few minutes to do it before the lane has been reset so the minions are in the middle of the lane again, so don't do this right before the gank, do it in good time to avoid having the jungler come up to your lane when minions are under tower.

2 - If the enemy is a champ like karthus

*Before setting the lane up for the kill

I also said that you should not ""ask out of frustration that you are losing the lane"" this is because that far too often i will see a lane spamming for someone to gank their lane, and has no cc to help you out. Instead of doing this, ask the jungler to hold your lane, or just recall without, and ask them to gank when you get back to the lane. This way you wont have you or the jungler die, expecting you to be able to help him out on the gank.



Those were ways to put the enemy in a position open to a gank


- When the jungler is about to gank the lane

This is because that some champions will simply just jump away when they see the gank comming

To avoid this, the time when people go in for a trade is when the enemy steps into a bad spot, you want to make them think you just made a bad step, you want to get them into a position that makes them voulnerable to a gank. Examples could be:

1 - Stuns: The enemy has a skillshot stun, make it look like a mistake. Then when they shoot it, you dodge, ping and go in for the kill. Your jungler will now be able to rush the target instead of having to dodge a morgana binding on the way.

2 - Leaps: If the enemy has a jump, akali, diana or jax. These champs can use the leap to avoid the jungle gank. Get them to jump closer to your side of the map, making them more open to ganks. To do this you need to know the approx range of the leap, and put yourself in a position where you, in the mindset of the enemy, would have attacked all in. Then the instant they jump you

*For all of the above tactics where you get them to attack you, and you still kill them, it was most likely worth it! An assist is 58% more gold to the team.*

- Zone the enemy!
If you want the enemy to get in a position closer to your jungler

Example for mid lane is if i want the enemy karthus to get closer to jax in top river brush. i then move down below my minions, and are forced to go upwards. When they do that, jax jumps out and stuns them, allowing for a quick and easy gank.


 - And to end it of i want to just give some good tips on how to keep the lane more gank friendly.

1 - Keep an eye on the enemy wards. Did they just ward the tribrush
If you don't know if the enemy has placed any wards, and comes back to lane, see if that number has changed. If it went 1 down, he just warded somewhere from where he came from, you can often guess exactly where.

2 - Keep a note on when he warded

3 - Pink ward a side of you lane if you want that side to be open for the jungler to gank

4 - Keep an eye on the enemy jungler

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/ashe ""Ashe"") **Ashe


Best kiting champion in the game. One of the best initiate abilities there is. Decent damage with incredibly good sustained DPS over the course of a fight. One of the single best carries to learn positioning with because she's autoattack dependent rather than ability dependent. Best champion to learn to kite with as well as chase with thanks to her infinite slow.

Masteries: 21/0/9

Runes: 9x flat AD reds, 3x flat AD quints. Standard AD to prioritize last hitting, taking as little harass as possible, and having better MR for lategame.

Summoners: [](/flash) and any of: [](/heal)

* [](/cleanse) is great to have against a heavy CC team
* [](/ghost) is awesome for a second escape and even better kiting than Ashe's typically extraordinary ability to do so. 
* [](/heal) for baits and staying alive. 

Skill order: WQWEWR or WEWQWR, E for vision. 

Item build: [](/bootsofspeed) + 3x [](/healthpotion) -&gt; 2x [](/doransblade) / [](/berserkersgreaves) / [](/vampiricscepter) -&gt; [](/bfsword) -&gt; [](/zeal) -&gt; [](/infinityedge) -&gt; [](/phantomdancer) -&gt; [](/thebloodthirster) / [](/lastwhisper) / defensive. 

[](/thebloodthirster) if the opposing team isn't building armor.

[](/lastwhisper) if they are.

Early [](/negatroncloak) if they're heavy on the magic damage (after [](/phantomdancer) works for this)

I like building [](/zeal) before completing my [](/infinityedge) because the added attack speed combined with Q is really nice for any fight you might run into

General tips:

* Try to catch someone important with your arrow if at all possible. It's not going to be very helpful to your team to hit that Mundo with it. I know, try to make the best of your ability to aim skillshots.

* When in fights

* Remember your hawkshot. Doing dragon and don't have vision of the entrance to river from their wraiths? Hawkshot it. It's a very handy tool for giving vision while going for any objective or if you feel the need to check an area. Just be careful since it's on a minute-long cooldown

* In lane, but Q is capable of making you incredibly frustrating to lane against since you're so hard to run away from.


*--by this1neguy*

[](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/blitzcrank ""Blitzcrank"") **Blitzcrank


Blitzcrank! My all-time favourite support. Blitz doesn't have much of what most other supports have; he has no heal and no buff for his ADC. All [](/blitzcrank) has is godlike initiation. Landing a Rocket Grab can turn a game around completely

Rocket Grab is a line skillshot that pulls the first enemy hit towards Blitzcrank. It has very long range and stuns the target as they travel. This is the cornerstone of Blitzcrank. Learn to land your hooks. I would really recommend trying him out in a bot game or two first

Skill order Q E W Q then Q&gt;W&gt;E&gt;R, a 500 damage AoE nuke + silence on a low cooldown is brutal.

Fairly standard support runes/masteries. If I want the early game burst I have been known to grab magic pen in offense, MR/Level blues. MS is really strong on Blitz because it lets you close the range for your grab just enough in so many situations.

Build wise, lots of burst = HoG. HoG fits in better with Blitz's bursty nature. You can get one or both, it depends on how well you are doing in lane. Both Shurelya's and Randuin's are solid items on him, so they aren't useless to you. If you are doing well in lane, a Sheen can really help you snowball the lane, but I would advise against it if you are losing. 

After that, Negatron should be fine for MR but you can go into FoN if you can afford it. TriForce really helps him dish out some damage, but you would only get this in games where you are really far ahead.

Late game you are the initiator for your team. Ward up, you have really good peel or dive, depending on what your team needs. Power fist makes it impossible to miss hook, so you can tie up bruisers for a little while. His ulti is great against a lot of mids, and basically hard counters Katarina. 

Practice the hooks. Believe in the fist. Every time you hook there will be a glorious moment of anticipation, especially blind into the fog of war will make you look like a badass too. This comes with lots of practice.

Blitz is banned a lot in draft because of how easy it is for him to win matches

Very strong champion, but you can do some harassing and get easy kills if your lane opponent lets you.

Summoners: Ignite/Flash

Masteries: 21/0/9

Runes: MPen reds, flat AP quints. Best bang for your buck, yellows and blues depend on your lane opponent.

Passive: Soul Siphon - 10/20/30% spell vamp when using abilities. Makes her a pain in the ass to lane against.

Q: Dark Binding. Does good damage, lets you do very good harass pre-6 if you can Q-&gt;W-&gt;autoattack, allows for kills once you hit level 6.

W: Tormented Soil. AoE damage

E: Black Shield. Every jungler's nightmare. Absorbs magic damage and blocks CC. Remember that it doesn't block physical damage

R: Soul Shackles. Nice little spell. Does damage while casted as well as slowing its targets with a stun at the end. Flashing into fights to use this on everyone will allow you to do very good team-wide damage

Skill build: QWWEWR

Item build:

Boots+pots start -&gt; 2x Doran's Ring -&gt; Zhonya's -&gt; Deathcap -&gt; situational. The only time I wouldn't start Zhonya's is if you're sure there won't be any teamfighting, WotA for ridiculous spellvamp, DFG if you want that bit of burst.

Remember to push and roam whenever you can

Riven is built as a strong hypercarry or tanky DPS in the top lane or the jungle. She is very mobile with her skills, CC will shut her down quite fast as she will not be able to combo her skills fast enough.

Runes:

* Marks: Flat AD or Armor Pen

* Seals: Flat Armor

* Blues : Flat/Scaling MR or Flat/Scaling CDR

* Quints: Flat AD

Masteries: http://solomid.net/masteries.php#1300430410010030101304001000000000000000000000000

Summoners: Flash/Ignite

For skilling, but feel free to put points in E if you need a stronger shield from harass early game. After that max either Q for damage or E for tankiness. E is a hard-scaling shield. A general build is to go Boots + 3 Pots, then Double Dorans into a Bloodthirster. From there, get Guardian Angel and Last Whisper/Frozen Mallet, and whatever tankiness items you need. In the laning phase try to last hit, but you can go all-in on certain champions at level 1, you do a ton of damage throughout the laning phase but can be caught in a compromising situation extremely quickly.

Quick Tips:

* Riven gains damage from autoattacking in between her skills

* Her third Q proc will slightly knockback someone

* Having her ult up increases her AD

1348338685.0,10b2b8,[Math] When to buy Banshee's Veil versus Force of Nature for tanking magic damage,lustigjh,30,5,15,"**Why make this comparison?**

While Force of Nature gives the most straight magic resistance, Banshee's Veil actually gives you more capability to tank magic damage.  This guide aims to show the point at which Force of Nature becomes the better item for tanking magic damage.  To make things more objective and straightforward, I have ignored any bonuses from the two items besides pure defensive stats.

Here are some abbreviations I will use and their definitions:

- BV: Banshee's Veil

- CE: Cost efficiency (a measure of how expensive an item's stats are in units of stat/gold)

- Eh: Effective health (an averaging of the next two terms aimed at approximating the total amount of damage you can tank)

- Emh: Effective magic health (this is the actual amount of magic damage required to kill you)

- Eph: Effective physical health (this is the actual amount of physical damage required to kill you)

- FoN: Force of Nature

- H: Max health (for the sake of this post

- MR: Magic resistance

I have divided this guide into four sections to cover four different scenarios that might matter:

1. When looking solely to gain the most Emh

2. When looking to get the most Emh out of your gold

3. When looking solely to gain the most Eh regardless of cost through one of these items

4. When looking to get the most Eh out of your gold through one of these items

On to the math and the questions at hand:

**If I want to tank as much magic damage as possible

The formula for Emh is as follows:

Emh = H(1 + MR/100)

Since FoN gives 76 magic resistance but no health

Emh = H(1 + 76/100) = 1.76H

Since Banshee's Veil gives health and magic resistance

Emh = (H + 375)(1 + 50/100) = 1.5H + 562.5

To find the point at which the two items give the same amount of Emh

1.76H = 1.5H + 562.5

H = 2163.46

So

**If I'm only concerned with building magic resistance

The answer to this question is found by dividing the formulas from the previous section by their respective item costs

CE = [H(1 + MR/100)]/C

Again trying to find the point at which FoN is a better choice:

(1.76H)/2610 = (1.5H + 562.5)/2715

H = 1700.40

Since only a very small handful of champs have a base maximum health of less than 1700 at level 18 and since none of those champions benefit from building tankiness over damage, BV gives you more Emh but each point of Emh will cost more than it would have if a FoN was purchased.

**Since BV gives health, when should I buy FoN?**

This section is a bit less accurate because we have to assume the damage output by the enemy is perfectly mixed between both physical and magic damage, an average of Emh and Eph):

Eh = .5[H(1 + MR/100) + H(1 + Armor/100)]

Eh = .5H[2 + (MR + Armor)/100]

By solving for H in the same manner as above

H = 3605.77

This means that at a max health of more than 3605

**If I want to take both the Emh and Eph offered by each item into consideration along with cost and buy the item that provides the most cost-effective overall tankiness

Dividing both sides of the previous equations by item cost gives the following answer:

H = 2526.70

So

**TL;DR/Summary:**

When to buy each item depends on your max health. So:

1. If you want to tank as much magic damage as possible, buy a Banshee's Veil.

2. If you want to tank as much magic damage as possible but only want to buy the cheapest stats

3. If you want the most overall tankiness from your item, buy a Banshee's Veil.

4. If you want the most overall tankiness from your item but only want to buy the cheapest stats

Keep in mind that the max health (H) you should consider will be your max health when you need the item in question

Some of these concepts might be confusing so I will be happy to clear them up and show specific examples in the comments.",self,t5_2t9x3,False,champSyn,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/10b2b8/math_when_to_buy_banshees_veil_versus_force_of/

Hi, so don't be to harsh on me... ^^ I wanted to think about smart casting and key binding problems.

**What is smartcasting?**

Smartcasting provides much needed speed and reaction time when playing assassin/combo-heavy champions like Annie, Talon, Veigar ... (generally all casters) Though it is possible to smartcast with [Shift][Q], I think smart casting should be FASTER and EASIER than normal casting. The difference to normal casting is: You don't see range indicators and you don't have to click to use the ability. Key press -&gt; Insta Use. After I played up to Level 30, I decided to give smart casting a chance. I smart cast every ability on every champ, just so that I don't have to remember which spell was smart casted when switching (tools for that can be found using Google), but other people like to see indicators for certain skill shots

**Rebinding keys**

I rebound smart casting to the standard QWER keys
I did the same for items

Any thoughts and/or other suggestions on how to improve smart casting / key binding for new players? 
Me thinks if you begin earlier to smart cast

**Note on rebinding/displayed keys**

You can rebind the keys by changing the text-file 'Riot Games\League of Legends\Config\input.ini'. Tutorials/custom bindings are available on the internet ^^.
If you rebind [Shift][Q] for normal casting, is to assign [Q][Shift] to normal cast's secondary key. It doesn't work, but gets the 'Q' displayed.

Clarity: ""clarity is bad. learn 2 manage mana, but Clarity will let you spam more and lane like crazy. Lots of people say ""don't waste a spot on clarity, take blue buff!"" I agree blue buff is awesome. But it’s not always viable to get (especially if your jungler is stupid  or needs it). And calling Clarity a “crutch” but saying you need blue buff? You’re just replacing a crutch with another crutch.

And along that same line of thought, because having a teleport is nice. But seriously people it’s a 260 second cooldown. Yeah you can reduce it to 245 seconds, but that’s still 4 minutes. Ridiculous CD, short teleport, and if they have flash also (which they do, because everyone has flash) it was useless. Most common argument I see is “Flash helps you escape a gank if you’re out of position.” Well you could say “learn 2 stay in position, noob. Crutch flash is crutch.” I’m not saying that

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I believe the core of the support playstyle is to do as much as you can with as little as you can. You have no tanky items, the most important person on your team. While the rest of your team provides the damage, the two of you enable the situation to produce that damage safely. Take the difference between support Zyra and mid Zyra. Both support and mid Zyra can initiate, but its risky. If support Zyra dies, it is of little consequence as she likely got off her initiation and your team can follow up, along with the added bonus of the enemy wasting burst on you. But if mid Zyra dies, the initiation is completed likely

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the purpose of warding, I ward both sides of the river (sometimes a little further out) so that I can play extremely aggressively without fear of the jungler coming when I'm diving. When you have a Lux or Ezreal on your team, warding their blue lets you steal it easily. *Supports carry games by enabling their teammates to make educated decisions on when to make plays.* If you have their whole jungle lit up, you can gangbang their ADC when he's catching up on farm with wraiths. But if the map is black, all MIA, you wouldn't dare go in there. If you have red warded and you see their jungler giving the ADC red, that's a free dragon/bot tower or baron/top tower, I want to advertise my favourite ward spot in the game: mid lane. When the towers go down, especially when people group mid for no reason as they do quite often in silver and gold. If you have poke

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Vision control is something you may hear about, is to establish an area of control on the map. When you pink the lane brush in bot lane, you are in control of that bush. When you have an oracles and sweep around Baron, you are in control of Baron. They're forced to either cede the Baron, or do some risky reconnaissance. When you have vision and vision control, you do almost anything you want. You can get more vision, you can gank anyone, for some of you in bronze or silver: sometimes you buy oracles and you see *nothingggggg*. That's fine

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As for learning how to learn how to support, you buy philo, sightstone, mobility boots, and oracles, and spend the rest of your money for the rest of the game on wards**. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How does this help you learn to support? Easy:

* You have no items

* You have no items, or a ward in the crook of the wall inside the pit. You have enough wards to practice all these spots.

* Mobi boots lets you ward everywhere, but mobi boots makes it easier. 

* Oracles lets you ward safely and expand your area of control. You don't want to ward their jungle without on

1374819535.0,1j2zek,A few tips about map awareness in mid-late game:,wakawakaching,29,6,4," * You always need to be asking yourself: Where will I be most useful next? The ability to ask yourself this question automatically can be trained: Play whole games with a champion you're familiar with consciously deciding to ask that question. Do that enough and you'll start getting good at it. This is especially true for mid/jungle as they are the two that end up roaming most in midgame/the transition to late game. The kinds of things you want to look for to make those decisions are mentioned a lot on this subreddit. If you're mid and there are four bot and one top
These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about when deciding where you will be most useful.

 * If you don't know how to play jungle, and what is useful for a jungler. You can learn this really quickly through trying out jungling. You learn how useful it is if bot lane clears wards for you, or top pushes their lane to let you gank through the lane bushes, or mid lets their lane get pushed. This will help you understand how to work with a jungler and what the jungler feasibly can/cannot do.
 * Objectives objectives objectives. Objectives win games. Begin to look for unprotected objectives or opportunities to easily pressure a tower. If you kill 4/5 of the enemy team and only lose two team members, or even take dragon if you're fed enough or it's late in the game. The global rewards for taking objectives far outweigh your individual farm or getting another kill. I don't remember where I heard this on here, but ""Kills snowball lanes, objectives snowball games."" 
 * Lastly, even if it's briefly. I can't tell you how many ganks I've been saved from by a teammate alerting me of an incoming lee sin or zac. This is especially true when you're really focused on farming or trading: You won't move your eyes at all from your action most of the time, so you'll miss things you would normally notice.

It is NOT the junglers duty to match the amount of times the enemy jungler has ganked your lane. If the enemy has ganked your lane 3 times, you are over extending, or you keep staying in lane with low health.

It is not the junglers responsibility to call ""MIA"" for the enemy jungler (seriously). I've had this a few times where I didnt tell a lane the jungler was coming (I am not joking) and it was ""my fault they died"". Yes

Do not think you are ""owed"" the buffs in the jungle. The common one is mid thinking they are entitled to blue buff. If the jungler knows what he is doing, accept you are having a bad game and attempt to change that.

Do not keep asking for ganks if you are behind in lane and have no kill potential. You will waste the junglers time

This is quite uncommon but it has happened to me, and very very toxic, so they took it upon themselves to inform the enemy in all chat where I was in the jungle. 

Do not rage at junglers when they take a few CS after a gank, when a laner isnt really going to miss a few CS here or there. On the flip side if the jungler is taking the piss, feel free to shout at them to get them to leave.

Do NOT rage at a jungler when he is freezing your lane until you get back to lane from base. He is not ""stealing your farm"" nor is he ""pushing your lane"". What he is doing is of benefit to the both of you, and the lane doesnt get pushed to your tower and your tower takes damage/you lose even more creeps due to your tower.
Again this has a flipside



To summarise, or during it for that matter, because all the jungler is going to think is that you're a toxic moron who isnt worth his time and chances are you'll receive even less help from him. The jungler is there to help your ENTIRE team, not just you, he is there to help you snowball, and secure objectives (among other things) but he is not to blame if you lose your lane. You were in the lane with your opponent, not your jungler.

Remember

1371175277.0,1gb7xn,What I've learned as I've climbed from Silver 5 to Silver 2.,luckyboyblu,27,4,16,"And when I say Silver 5

1. Do not fight Riven from levels 1-3. She will beat you hard. The only person I've lost to as Riven in those levels is Jax

2. As an ADC

3. If you are a support like Leona

4. If you notice everyone is coming for you

5. End a game as fast as you can. Don't try and get kills for fun. I've lost games where we were up 40 kills just because we gave them the chance to catch up.

6. Stop arguing with people. Even if you are losing

7. If your support isn't warding

8. If you lose a game

9. If you are getting camped

10. Don't just counterpick and assume you'll win. If the person is good with their champion

11. On the otherhand, and I regularly beat people who pick Renekton, Jayce, Teemo, etc. into me because I know how to play against them.

12. Don't say gg in champion select. I had an Irelia freak out because we had no tank and we would definitely lose. We easily won that game

13. The game is not over until the Nexus explodes. I've had two games today in which we were down by a large margin, people will probably throw. If they overextend, pick them off.

14. Look at your advantages and expand on them. Is the enemy top laner scared to cs because of you? Only attack the creeps when they have a tiny amount of health to freeze the wave and deny them more. Zone them from it. If they are gone

There's a lot more, but it's helping my friend get out of Bronze (started Bronze 4, now in Bronze 1 promos to Silver!), so I figured they might help others.",,False,self,1371175714.0,t3_1gb7xn

---------------

Anyway, instalockers, and what have you that will keep the player in question away from their true ranking. Blanket Ninja and I have been playing in Bronze Elo for the past few days, and we have experienced these individuals firsthand for most of our games. Let's have a look at the offenders we've found down here!

* **""WTF I called [x]!""** Probably the most common dude down here, leading to some silly consequences in game like having to duo top.

    *Example:* 

   [WTF I called [x]!]: adc pls

    goodfeel: mid

   Lunatyco118: top

  A Purple Marmot: middle or top please

 FearWarrior: adc

  [WTF I called [x]!]: WTF DUDE

  [WTF I called [x]!]: SRSLY

  [WTF I called [x]!]: im picking twitch

  [WTF I called [x]!]: idc

    **How to deal with:** Instacalling in Bronze is the norm and both teams have to deal with it. You as a player do not have a disadvantage in regards to the other team because your team has a WTF I called [x] - chances are

-------------

* **""0/4 in 5 minutes feeder""** A lot of players complain that one of their teammates went into lane and played very poorly

  *Example:* [This horrible A Purple Marmot person goes 0/5 top lane and feeds Lee Sin!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MggcORAah50)

  **How to deal with:** Hey, don't tell them they're doing bad or anything, because chances are they already know. A little encouragement and help will go a long way.

---------------

* **""WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!""** This guy is almost as common as WTF I called [x]. You'll see him raging at anyone whose score is negative and saying ""gg"" if the enemy team gets first blood

  *Example:* 

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: fking junglr camping me

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: no mia from noob bot gg

  [WTF U SUCK AT VIDEO GAEMS!!!1#!]: noob bot is y im not diamond

  **How to deal with:** Mute them. Most of the time

--------------

* **""Oh crap, or they might not. You never know - it's like a surprise!

 *Example [this actually happened to me]:*

  [Oh crap

  [Some guy]: LEAVE HER OUTSIDE U FKING USELESS PIECE OF $#@^ MAOKAI

  **How to deal with:** Stuff happens! It's frustrating to deal with an AFK player, but know that emergencies happen all the time.

  But sometimes you'll get the guy who goes 0/2 in lane and flat out ragequits. It sucks, play passive, farm up what you can, and report the ragequitter in the post-game lobby.

-------------------

* **""gg they have [x]""** This guy will complain when you don't ban Amumu/Shen/Malphite/Blitz etc., but when you're behind, all he'll say is ""gg didn't ban [x]"".

  *Example:* 

  [gg they have [x]]: PCIK SHEN
  
 [gg they have [x]]: WTF they got shen

  **How to deal with:** There are reasons why certain champs are considered OP in certain ranks. Malphite, so people ban him because they can't counterplay him. Besides saying something like ""Shen isn't that OP"", all you can pretty much do is encourage your team to engage in counterplay - maybe gank Malphite more to shut down his farm, or tell your teammates not to stand on top of each other, or pick Janna to reset a fight.

----------------

That's about all I can recall off the top of my head. If you have anyone to add with details on how to deal with them

Cheers and have a lovely day!
