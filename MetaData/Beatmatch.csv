1371507030.0,1gjmtm,Why I'm not going to listen to your mix or leave feedback.,omers,156,25,78,"EDIT: Please visit [&lt;modpost&gt; How should we handle the posting of DJ mixes in /r/Beatmatch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gk5tu/modpost_how_should_we_handle_the_posting_of_dj/) - created by /u/djscsi.

I spend an awful lot of time on this subreddit and its sister /r/DJs and I often feel bad looking at the number of mixes looking for feedback with absolutely no comments but as soon as I click on them I nope right out of there remembering why I don't listen to them.

I am only one person and not a very important one at that but I hope by sharing my reasons for ignoring your mix it might be similar to the reasoning of others and that it might make posting your mix easier so you can get the feedback you need.

My reasons in no particular order for ignoring your mix:

- **""My First Mix""**: If you want to know what you can improve on your first mix the answer is everything. All I picture in my head when thinking about someones first mix is poor phrasing, poor musical programming, and a host of other problems. I have never clicked on a first mix and been even remotely impressed. Posting your very first mix and looking for feedback is the same as posting ""how do I DJ"" without the mix so it's a waste of time. Practice a little more.
- **""[Electro Bangers/Dubstep/Trap]""**: I'm not one to judge people on their musical taste and I even like some Electro House ([*this track*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUnCwZhkIgQ) is epic) but the problem is that every single Electro/Dubstep/Trap mix is the same tracks just in a different order. I am so ridiculously sick of Deadmau5, Zeds Dead, Zedd, and all of the other chart topping producers I can't even begin to explain it. A track list like that says to me that you haven't found your musical niche yet and you're still living on charts and there's nothing I can do to help you with that.
* **""[House]""** I'm a House/Tech-House DJ
* **When I do comment many people don't reply.** When I take the time to listen to a mix and type up feedback it's not something I bang together in 5 minutes; I actually listened to your one hour mix, being ignored so many times has put me off the whole experience.
* **I'd like to see more information in your post.** Since almost no one on here posts video I can't tell what you're doing and my feedback to someone using CDJs is not going to be the same as it would be to someone using VirtualDJ and a mouse. Post some details about your setup
* **You're not active in this community.** This goes back to people not leaving replies and my fear that the mix is just mix spam; when I check your post history and it's all in /r/Pokemon and there is nothing in /r/Beatmatch or /r/DJs it makes me suspicious. Take the time to comment on some other mixes, start the ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" movement.

So in short you need to get active in the community, post something we haven't heard 100 times, and say thank you when others take the time to try and help you.

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening DJs! 

I see a lot

----

1) **Insufficient time to become properly acquainted with the music.** If you have to cram to get music for a gig because you don't already have any for the style needed you will not have a sufficient amount of time to get to know the songs

You could easily be caught off guard when a song that skipping through sounded lyrical but actually had some really gritty drops for example.

----

2) **Insufficient time to build an adaptable library.** In a short time you will not be able to acquire enough tracks with enough variety so that if the crowd isn't feeling what you're playing you can switch it up within the same genre. 

Most DJs within their genres can create dozens of completely different sounding sets without leaving the base genre... Cramming for a gig will not give you enough variety to adapt to changing situations at the gig. Seasoned DJs do not stick to a pre-planned set if the crowd isn't feeling it

----

3) **You're taking gigs away from people who could do them better and eventually the same will happen to you.** 

If you play House as an example

Karma is a bitch.

----

4) **Not all music is created equal.** Although the technical side of mixing is generally fairly consistent among related genres (4x4, the way you actually mix the genre to get the proper feeling and do the genre justice will vary considerably.

For example

----

5) **Just because it's popular with other DJs online or on Beatport doesn't mean it's popular in clubs.**

I can give you my Top 10 House tracks of the moment or of all time but that doesn't mean my Top 10 will be crowd pleasers so asking other DJs for musical advice isn't always the best way to build a library. Further

Knowing the scene in your city and the type of music people go out to see is paramount. It's not possible for a single person to follow every scene in a city which is why we tend to specialize in a smaller number of genres... 

----

6) [edited in] **If you're new

Every DJ has bad nights but stacking the odds against yourself for the reasons above seems counter productive if you're new to gigging and you're trying to make a name for yourself. Until you have some recognition and are booking gigs consistently you shouldn't be doing anything that could make you look bad on stage. It's far too easy for new DJs to fade into obscurity if they don't leave a good impression early on.

As a promoter

**Story time:**

So I was looking for a DJ to fill an opening slot for an event I threw a few weeks ago. These kids got a hold of me begging for the slot. They didn’t have any mixes online but I needed to slot filled so I let them open. Boy

When they started, they kept going in the red thinking the problem was on the tech side. They sounded like shit for the rest of the set (with the exception of a few songs I know they got off of dubstep.net). If I had another DJ to finish their slot, I would have kicked them off in a heartbeat.

**A message to new DJs:**

I realize that getting music can be rather costly when you add it all up. When pirating is right around the corner it’s hard not to do it. But I will tell you as a guy who hires DJs, it just shows me that you don’t want to be taken seriously.

This also applies to making a mix to send out to promoters. If I am listening to your mix and the quality keeps changing throughout it then I am going to delete it and move on to the next one.

When it comes to getting a lot of music, subscribe to the Beatport email list. They regularly give out coupon codes for 10-20% off a purchase. ~~If you are seriously strapped for cash then at least look at the file that you are downloading. If it isn't at least 256 kps then delete it.~~ Edit: Read bart2019's comment.

I made the decision last night after my little rant about mixes blew up to start a series of posts covering some of the topics that I think need a little more focus. My plan is to create a new post every few days and possibly include some videos at some point down the line on topics that I consider to be ""questions that should be frequently asked.""

Part of my rant yesterday included the fact that a lot of the mixes around here contain very similar tracklists so I am going to start this series of posts with some tips on digging for music in the digital age. We'll also go over a number of different sites where you can find music and touch on some of the free options like Soundcloud.

**A Quick Note on Piracy**

I do not condone the piracy of music for the purpose of DJing

**Where to Find Music**

There are a lot of different sites these days where you can buy music, some supplementary links, and I am going to tell you which sites I use. 

* **Digital Music Sites**

* **Acapellas**  
http://www.acapellas4u.co.uk/  
and many of the sites above.

What I use: I use a combination of Beatport.com

**How to Find Top 40**

I am including this because it comes up an awful lot that someone has taken a Top 40 gig and has no idea what Top 40 even is. Top 40 literally means the Top 40 tracks on a given chart but it has also come to mean the majority of commercial music that sees play time on big radio.

You can find the current Billboard Top 100 here: http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 and the pop only chart here: http://www.billboard.com/charts/pop-songs. You should also supplement Billboard charts with charts from your local radio stations which should be available online so as to ensure you get any geographically unique chart toppers.

You can actually get the Top 40 music from pretty much any of the record pools above and a handful of the digital music sites including iTunes and Amazon. On some occasions you may even be able to find Top 40 bootlegs on Soundcloud or even official mixes from artists like Jump Smokers who often release free tracks.

**How to Actually Dig for Music**

Digging is a term that goes back to the vinyl days when we had to dig through crates upon crates of records in actual stores to find the absolute must have tracks because things were expensive back then and you couldn't just buy everything. These days the honest truth is that digging often means digging through the crap to find the music actually worth having.

I am going to tailor my examples to Beatport.com but they apply to most sites with any sort of breadcrumbs (that will make sense in a minute.) I am also going to focus on Electro House to appeal to the largest audience on this subreddit but it applies to all genres.

* NOTE: I highly recommend that you install [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) and click ""View Images"" at the top so you can see the examples inline.

1. Start by opening http://www.beatport.com/ and then clicking the green ""GENRES"" button followed by ""Electro House""   
http://i.imgur.com/bBQH00u.png
2. There are four helpful sections on the first page of any genre, the new releases which will show you some of the newest stuff available, and the staff picks which sometimes has some gems in it.
3. Take some time to explore the Top 10 and DJ charts and find something you really like. I personally really like Martin Garrix - Animals (Original Mix) so I am going to use it as my jump off. First I am going to add Animals to my cart by hovering over it and clicking the green ""+"" and then I am going to open Martin Garrix and Spinning Records in new tabs (both are links right on the chart).  
http://i.imgur.com/cYj3vFW.png
4. From Martin Garrix's page I am going to go through his personal Top 10 looking for anything else I might like and open some of the other record pools his tracks are found on in new tabs (Tiger Records
http://i.imgur.com/88VfEq8.png
5. On the track list for an artist you will see that everything is clickable so if an artist has collaborated with someone or remixes someone else's music you can open that artist into yet another tab. From Martin's track list I added Julian Jordan to my list of open tabs.
6. As I finish on Martin's track list I am going to close that tab and move on to the next open tab which is the Musical Freedom record label page and go through their Top 10 and popular releases adding more things to my cart and opening more artists into new tabs before continuing on to the Tracks list for the record label.
7. On the record label tracks list I am going to sort the genre by Electro House so that I don't have to see anything else as I'm only digging for electro right now and then I am going to go through the first couple of pages previewing tracks and adding things to my cart. All the while I am opening yet more artists into new tabs.  
http://i.imgur.com/SFBxGKc.png
8. From this point on you continue to close tabs moving on to the next open tab and continue the same process of listening, and repeating until you have found a suitable number of tracks. Keeping in mind that everything on Beatport is a breadcrumb (link) to similar content.

Tips:

* Every artist and record label has a blue ""Follow"" button on their page. When you follow an artist or label you will get periodic emails when there are new releases from that person or group.
* It is extremely important to use tabs when digging for music and a browser like Chrome or FireFox is the way to go. 
* If you like a particular song always follow the links to the artist(s) and label because you're likely to find similar content.
* If the preview is not long enough try searching YouTube for the song name and you're likely going to find it there.
* This process works for most digital music sites as breadcrumbs are common practice.

**Finding New Music With YouTube**

Many record labels and artists these days have YouTube channels with promotional releases. For example Spining Records from the examples above has a channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/SpinninRec and you can hit play on one of the playlists like the ""Exclusive Previews"" playlist and just let it go in the background while you do other things. If a song catches your attention write down the name to look it up the next time you go digging. 

**Who the Hell is Omers?**

My name is Nick and I have been playing clubs, Hard House, and these days play House &amp; Tech-House. I maintain a weekly residency at a gay club and also play all over at raves and club nights along with festival appearances during the summer. 

I have also written two articles for DJTechTools.com which you can find here: http://www.djtechtools.com/author/omers/ one on Record Pools and one on taking gigs outside of your comfort zone.

This: http://i.imgur.com/t2tJ9.jpg

When I am looking for mixes to listen to I like finding them on YouTube where there is an actual video and I can watch what the DJ is doing. Too often you see people practising at home with their eyes glued to the screen because there is nothing else there to engage them. This bad habit is hard to break so when you practice for hours on end at home always looking at your screen it will happen when you get in front of an audience. 

Here are some ideas to help you break this habit at home so you can break it at the club/at parties.

- **Put a mirror on the wall in front of your setup.** It may seem narcissistic to watch yourself when you DJ but it really does help having something moving/alive in front of you even if it's your own mug. Not only will this give you something else to focus on but you can also see your form/technique from a different perspective and you may notice things like the fact you touch the knobs way more than necessary that you can correct.  
- **Face your setup towards a TV and find a video of people dancing.** This might sound even more lame than the mirror but it's another thing you can focus on instead of the screen and you can immerse yourself more by imagining the dancers on the TV are grooving to your beats.
- **Face your laptop away from you except when you're picking songs.** Find one of those spinning platforms used in the center of the dinner table and stick your laptop on it

There is nothing more depressing than a DJ who spends an entire set staring at their screen (except maybe a DJ using sync who's staring at their screen... seriously... what are they staring at?). Breaking the habit will help you engage an audience more which will set you apart. Audiences like a DJ who is engaged and who is dancing around; if your feet are planted in the same spot for a whole hour and you're not looking at the crowd you're doing something wrong...

Take them how you want. Fellow veterans

1. Practice – Stop being lazy

2. Stop with the micro-genre madness – Successful DJs rarely get booked if they list themselves as only playing “micro-step wobble house.” - Diversity can be your best friend.

3. It's the operator, used equipment – they managed to make it work, you will too. That $1,400 mixer will make your weak mixes sound like a Hi-Fi weak mix.

4. You are NOT a unique snowflake - You are semi-skilled labor: the market for club/party DJs is generally saturated – expecting promoters to seek you out is a surefire way to assure you never get out of your bedroom. You are also not an artist

5. Don't anchor yourself to the scene, why would you carry someone if they aren't willing to put in the work that you have?

6. Track selection - People are tired of hearing the same tracks over and over

1345242172.0,yef9z,On DJing at Gay Clubs (Mostly for Heterosexual Males) [xpost from /r/DJSetups],omers,42,7,17,"It was suggested I post this here for those of you who might be interested in a residency at a gay club.

Where I live it's amazing. The two gay clubs are the only places that consistently play house music and can get away with housier remixes of the necessary top 40. I have not had to play a radio edit ever. We also have a monthly House/Tech-House night with zero top40 even in remix form (It's called 'We Are Not Pop') which is part of the regular programming and people love it.

Now

There are a couple gotcha's that are fairly universal to gay clubs thought that anyone interested should be aware of:

- Drag queens still play an important role in much of the gay scene so you may be called upon to stop everything and play something unusual for a drag performance at peak hours depending on the club. Our club doesn't do this but I know clubs that do.
- In the same vein, Florence and the Machine, and so on in to your mix when they request it (remixes of course).

There are also some things straight men need to be aware of if considering a gay club as a potential venue or residency:

- You will probably get hit on by guys. If you're a dick about it you'll be the one out the door not the patron. Just say 'sorry
- If you have a lot of straight female friends that normally hang out with you in the DJ booth like many 'straight club' DJs
- You will see shirtless guys
- Don't bother hitting on women (if there is female clientèle that is as some gay clubs are almost exclusively male) even if there are straight women there which inevitably there will be (fag-hags and such) they expect to be left alone at the gay bar.
- Gay clubs are a lot more sexually free than most heterosexual clubs. You may be asked by the owner to play up your looks by DJing shirtless or things of that nature (this isn't always the case but it may happen). 
- Also along the sexually free track

1363506184.0,1ageut,Your hearing is important! Take care of it with these few tips!,kelvinyap9,36,2,20,"Hey /r/Beatmatch!

I'd like to share my thoughts and tips on protecting your hearing. I couldn't really find anything similar to a post like this in this sub-reddit

Your ears are extremely important to you

-----

Some people think your ears can heal from being damaged. This is **NOT** the case. The hairs inside your ears do not recover if they have been damaged. Once your hearing is gone

-----

**How do I protect my hearing?** - Here are a few things I've learnt over the years:

- The obviously one is to turn down the volume of your headphones/speakers, it is.

- Don't turn up the volume of your music if the train you're in is too loud and you want to drown the outside noise away. This is just adding more volume to the already loud enough noise outside

- Try not to expose your ears to a noisy environment. For example, try to keep away from them, or even cover your ears (make sure it's safe to do so!) until you're far away from them enough to not feel any pain in your ears.

- Go clubbing often? Don't be one of the retards that stand next to the blaring speaker with a drink in their hand

- Get some musician's earplugs! This is going to be one of the best investments you'll ever make, and I highly recommend them. You should definitely own a pair if you haven't already. 

    I suggest getting these: [Etymotic Research ER20](http://www.etymotic.com/hp/er20.html) and they claim to reduce sound by 20dB, you want Standard. If you wear Medium/Large sized earphone tips or above, you want Large.)

    You can get custom ones done

I see this time and time again. Levels, Skrillex, and all of the billion Clarity remixes out there.


**BORING.**


You see


You need to expand your library. Branch out from the Porter Robinsons and the Aviccis. This doesn't mean you can't play the same style of music


A neat way to look for new/unknown tunes is to [look up the various genre subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/musicsubreddits) Occasionally, **YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.**


That said


Also, and Dubstep. Maybe some Psy-Trance or Breaks to keep things interesting? Or how about some Swing House for that classy yet fun feel? Branching out from the norm will not only will help you stand out from the crowd, it will also help you master your DJ skills.


Sending out a mix to promoters that consists of mostly “unknown” songs shows that you actually give a fuck. You spent the time searching for songs instead of just downloading the top 40 chart on Beatport or iTunes like every other person out there. While this isn't a guarantee that you will get hired over the other DJs (since sometimes it's a popularity issue)

It's been pointed out (and I agree) that banning mixes is drastic.  I wanted to propose it as an extreme to provoke discussion.  Alternatives include:

* No change (The easiest solution)

* Making all mix posts be self posts (that require OP to describe what they view as strong and weak points)

* Having a time limit on mixes shared here (All of Song A --&gt; Transition --&gt; Swift fade-out of Song B)

* Requiring users to give feedback before getting it (In a weekly thread similar to /r/edmproduction)

* Better moderation of rulebreakers (deleting all posts without tracklists/transition times)

* Require all posts to have tags ([Mix][Gig][Discussion][Speakers][Controllers]) for easier sorting

Assuming I keep with the 3 hours a day the whole way through it will take me almost 9 years (if my math is right) to reach that goal. I've been doing this for about 6 months now and some of the things I notice about it this kind of practice is:

You stop sticking to any kind of genre after awhile. It honestly started to get boring for me playing the same kind of music all the time. I started to expand my taste and mixing genre's together simply because you will run out of music that will interest you.

Which brings up the next point. It will force you to keep finding new music. If you're stuck mixing the same thing over and over you'll lose your mind so you start looking deeper then most people do and trying to find anything that will work.

You'll try new things. Before I started doing this I never used effects and if I did it was always the same ones. But you start to really learn the in's and out's of your stuff and start to play around more and more.

I'm not saying all of this to brag about it or to say this is what you have to do. I just wanted to point out this 10
The 10,000 hours using an effect to master it. This means that I will never truly be a master of djing. There will always be something I can improve on.

Reasons: I played violin for 8 years of my life, if you're a beginner, you just don't know what you want. Here's my favorite example of just go with it and learn, as told by a tale of three bases.

 
~     


1.) When I was first getting into bass playing, cheap, with a lame ""police line, do not cross"" strap and a matching red cord. 

This is most people's initial instinct when buying something, and I thought that bass would be perfect for my little alt. rock band my buddy started. 

This bass was perfect for my needs at the time, not a pick, and this bass was more pick inclined. 

I preferred booming low end bass and the pick ups here weren't very good


~    
 

2.) My second bass I bought from a friend of a friend for what I'm pretty sure was an attempt for drug money. It was a black bass, and had an active drive. The bass was amazing and I thought I had landed on my dream bass guitar. 

It wasn't flashy, and as my skills improved and my tone became more important, my low end mattered less and an overall good sound was more important. 

That and I realized I didn't like the look of my bass


~ 


3.) Bass 3, something that I liked the look of, and a bass that had a clean, but solid low end. I found it, I bought it, and loved the bass every gig after that.


~


Beginners: buy something you like, cdjs, controller, brand, software/no software you want. Just get something inexpensive, make sure you like spinning and can enjoy it and have fun learning what your style is and as you learn you'll start realizing what products best fit it. 

This is something you wade into, sit at your computer with headphones on and just see what you like. If you love it, great, if you don't? friend or pawn shop. Don't overspend and don't freak out about it, just get SOMETHING and learn by doing. That's the best way to figure out what music you like and what to get to facilitate that the best.

tl;dr just buy something cheap,False,self,t5_2syix,1339607331.0,,,t3_uzyvu

At this point I just liked listening to the music and this was back when you had to buy the CD's not just listen to it on youtube or beatport. I remember listening to the same songs hours on end

Fast forward lets say 4 years to when I was 15. I get my first computer and a few months down the road I torrent a cracked version of traktor. I could barely get a song to play in the damn thing let alone get these huge mixes like on the annuals. I was clearly upset

Maybe a year later I was back listening to songs, today was the day! What followed for the next few hours is something I hope no one ever has to hear in their life. I didn't know the first thing about beat-matching or dropping the song in on time or even fading for that matter. It was a complete train wreck, however I could actually get a start on this program and I think one transition I faded. I had a taste and even though I knew I was horrible I knew for the first time in a while that I could maybe do this again.

For the rest of high school I just played around on VDJ very sparsely. Maybe once a fortnight on average I would have a little play around then  realise I was horrible and quit out. After a while though I realised that I could keep time. I watched many tutorials about dj'ing but just figuring thing out by myself was the way to go. As time went on I found my self spending a whole evening playing on my laptop trying to match up beats and do a little fading between songs. I could never make more than one transition without stuffing up but it didn't matter because I was beginning to have fun. This was a big turning point because now I was getting in practice

Late in my final year of high school I made my first mix tape. It had 12 dub step songs on it and I made 3 copies. I gave one to my girlfriend

The next year was my first year in university. I hardly touched my songs at all because I was so busy adjusting to the lifestyle (Read: Drinking) I completely forgot about it. I could see my real life career coming for me now and so nothing else mattered.

Something needed to happen to get me back into it, but it was worth it! I remember going home that night and downloading every song I loved over the past 2 years. I was like coming back to the door crying and begging to be let in. Suffice to say that I have been to every festival that has come to my city from then till now.

I practiced my heart out and made some short 10-20 min mixes that were getting pretty good. It needs to be said that I was very shy and not many people knew that I was into this and did it as a hobby. I slowly mentioned it to a couple more people when we were on the topic of music and said I would do some mixes for people if they wanted. 

One year ago is when the ball really started rolling. My friend came to me and said he tried doing a mix for this party he was going to but couldn't do it and wanted my help. I pictured myself struggling in the beginning and could imagine what he was going through and agreed to help. He gave me the songs and we sat there all night getting 2 mixes perfect. They were 20 minutes each and were pretty close to flawless when I had finished them. He thanked me heaps and I asked him to judge the parties response to the music and give me feedback. About a week later he came back to me and said everyone loved them. He said they wished it was longer. I was ecstatic!

Up until this point I had been worried about really spending money on anything because I wasn't exactly great at sticking to my hobbies (Seriously I still have a $600 telescope that I used like once). I knew that to move on from this stage I had to get some hardware and learn on that. I knew the basics but that was really all

I stalled a little with the new learning curve and I would still go back to my VDJ a lot because I could't do something on this new fancy machine that I just bought. I almost gave up again

It was about this point where I read a book caller ""Outliers"". It is all about what makes a successful person different from an average person, practice make perfect, but for some reason that made it seem achievable. I thought, all I need to do is play on these decks for 10,000 hours and I will be a professional. I would spend every spare minute just to run over to my decks and just do a quick fade because I knew that was adding onto my 10,000 hours. I quickly got passed the stall and moved on completely from VDJ realising all the potential I now had with this new controller.

I went to my friends birthday party about 6 months ago. We all went to his house for some drinks then got on one of those party buses that took us into the clubs in town. We piled on to the bus and the music started. I was dancing for a while and then I noticed that I knew the order of the songs. It was the mix that I had first done for my other friends party. I asked him where he had got it and he said how my other friend had handed out the mix to pretty much everyone who would listen and they all really enjoyed it. I felt great at this point

Over the next few months I kept up my practice

2 weeks ago I get the call, all the horror stories from DJ's I had read came flooding back. I made mixes so that if I was struggling I could just chuck one on and be safe for 20 minutes. This was all about survival not reading the crowd or anything like that!

The day finally comes. I rock up slightly early and begin plugging speakers in (also the first time I had encountered PA systems but I had done my research so it all went down fine). I booted everything up and put a 16 bar loop on the intro to a song with just the kick drum. I got the levels right and eq'd the amp properly then dropped out of the loop. 

I knew I had about 3 hours to play

I was thanked and got a big cheer from the crowd. I couldn't stop smiling my dream had been realised at that moment. The principal of the school came to me and said if they have any more events or socials that I would be their first choice and next time they would pay for sure. I thanked them probably way too much

Hopefully you can take something from this story and apply it to what ever stage you are at. Remember that everyone starts at the first hour of their 10

Sorry it turned into more of a life story but take what you can from it and I would love to hear what stage you are at

My biggest tip would be to make some mixes and give them to people

First off

So I've come up with an idea that will help improve the skills of DJs here new and old and have fun while doing so.
The Mix of the month competition is great for getting feedback, instead you should try your own adoption.

Challenges will vary from mixing techniques to song selection, shaking things up, etc etc. To enter, simply attempt the challenge and provide the audio recording (Some challenges may require video). Audio / Video shouldnt exceed 5 minutes, but ideal duration will be upto each challenge. The point is to keep it short and sweet though. 

The judge is you! There will be no winner of the challenges but when you submit, even if you just use a Keyboard and mouse.

I'm also looking for moderators of this sub to endorse this thread to help get the exposure and promote DJs here to participate. As well as a section on the side bar.

Stay tuned becuase the first challenge will be released soon after Christmas! (So you can try out all your new DJ goodies)",self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/159g15/fortnightly_challenges_have_you_got_what_it_takes/

1.) Which songs should I play? it would be really easy to play straight bangers BUT because I'm there to warm up the crowd

 2.) Should I play my own music? I have over an hour's worth of my own productions that I could play

3.) How long of a setlist should I go for and should I plan ahead for it? I know that the club I'm mixing at will have a specific amount of time they want me to shoot for, I have about 20-30 minutes of the set planned out from the start of the mix, and then I fill in the rest of the hour or so with tracks on the fly. I guess what I'm really wondering is if I should plan out the entire thing, or do what I usually do?

Anyway, any advice/tips would be wonderful.  Thanks :)

1331576747.0,qt80t,The Camelot Wheel and key matching.,DerpWY,21,1,30,"Hey DJs

Just wanted to introduce everyone to or remind everyone about using key matching when you play your sets.

The reason this is important is when you're overlaying one track on another, each track that you have will be in a specific key -- say, A minor for example. That key corresponds to a numeric code (in this case, 08A) on the camelot wheel, which you can find [here](http://mediacontender.com/images/posts/HarmonicMixing_CamelotWheel.png). From looking at the wheel, you can see the two keys that would mesh most naturally with A minor: 09A and 07A. You don't have to stick with just one move to the left or right on the wheel though, the numbers just indicate which keys have the most notes in common with each other

One downfall of this program is that it can be hard for DJs that are just starting out to get an indication of what key their tracks are in. Thankfully, you can always search out tracks that you have gotten elsewhere with their website's search, to see if they have the key info. If you have tracks that you have gotten elsewhere and you can't find the camelot wheel info on beatport, you can break out your synth (or a synth app on your phone, for that matter) and work out the key from there by playing scales and listening for what sounds right. A good resource for finding out what piano keys correspond to which scale can be found [here](http://www.pianoworld.com/fun/vpc/piano_chords.htm).

Key matching isn't necessarily the golden standard for mix DJs, can help ensure that you never play two tracks with clashing keys over the top of one another.

**TL; DR: If you don't already

1st thing is make sure you can beat match by ear

2nd. Don't use preplanned sets spend some time learning your music so you can mix on the fly

3rd you probably have access to a lot of alcohol

4th have fun with the times you are given, use that time to experiment and get better especially if the place is slow.

Welcome to the first Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  We are taking some cues from /r/edmproduction here


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Hi /r/beatmatch

This topic has come up several times in the last year or so, that there is not enough feedback given, that this isn't really the right place to post your new mix, etc.  Some of this is currently being discussed in this post by omers:  [Why I'm not going to listen to your mix or leave feedback.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gjmtm/why_im_not_going_to_listen_to_your_mix_or_leave/)

TL;DR: If you don't want to read the rest

So we feel that we have a few options as to how to proceed:

1)  Relegate mixes to a weekly (or monthly) thread so that people can listen and give feedback all in one place.  People who are interested in listening and providing feedback would participate in the thread

2)  Create a new/separate subreddit for mix feedback.  This could be combined with option #1

3)  Leave everything as it is

4)  Ban individual mix posts altogether.  People can use the month to work on their skills and submit something to the MotM contest.

Since this has come up a few times I thought I'd include links to some previous discussions in addition to the thread omers started:

* [Is this subreddit for posting mixes or for general questions/answers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/pw8io/is_this_subreddit_for_posting_mixes_or_for/) (1 year ago)

* [Why not ban the posting of mixes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/17m22b/discussion_why_not_ban_the_posting_of_mixes/) (4 months ago)

So we would like everyone to please comment in this thread.  If you have posted a comment previously in another thread, we can make a more proper survey with SurveyMonkey or something.  If there are any questions/topics/options you think should be included on such a survey, including demographic info, please make those suggestions.

Basically, any other problems you see, any ideas we missed, or any other general opinions/complaints.  Feel free to politely debate people who disagree with you and upvote the people who most succinctly agree with you.  Hopefully there is some sort of consensus so we can come to a decision and get back to playing music :)  ",,False,self,1371607906.0,t3_1gk5tu

I simply cannot do without performing music

I know there's tons of different controllers, some have both. Some are just pads you can hit. I really can't decide what style is best suited for myself. Do I have to have the scratch wheels? Will it make me less of a DJ if I don't?
I have DJ'd one party of a friends with a very ghetto set up which included my Axiom 25 Key controller

What I do know, high passes, delays, reverbs: The effects. Simple to use, and I'm sure I've only scratched the surface. But I know that I really enjoyed manipulating the track, setting the mood, and the like. I'm definitely a 'digital dj' as I've heard, and is most affordable.

I've been practicing DJing for about two and half years religiously with the intention of making it my career. I've done quite a few house parties and have a (very) small fan following on Facebook. I will be turning 18 in a month and it is my dream to get a residency at a club. I know this will not be easy however so I've come to you guys for advice and hoping you can answer a few questions.

1. How do I go about getting club gigs?

2. Is there any legal things I should get sorted out before sending my stuff off to clubs/playing at them?

3. I have always used Turntables with wax or Traktor Scratch but I am fairly competent with CDJs. Will it be a problem if I bring along my laptop and hook it up to the club's turntables or should I just become proficient in what the club's gear is?

4. If not nightclubs where else would you recommend me starting out in the industry?

5. What is the best way to approach venue owner's/club managers etc.?

6. What sort of attitude should I approach people with?

7. How long do you recommend I make demo tapes go for? I was thinking of making hour long mix tapes for each genre I'm interested in and then sending those CDs off to clubs which specialize in that genre.

8. Email? Letter? Phonecall? In person?

9. How to avoid any common fuckups?

10. Best ways to promote myself?

1364153180.0,1axehb,So....my Traktor S4 has spoiled me and I lost beatmatch skills from years ago...need some help!,Spork2000,14,1,14,"Hey guys!

So long story short

Then I got a DJM 500 mixer and fell victim to the dreaded BPM counter. My mixes got exponentially better but any 'natural' beatmatching skills I developed started to fade.

Then I moved on to Serato

Then I moved on to CDJ-1000's which I again used digital means to beatmatch with.

About 7 years ago

Last year I bought a Traktor S4 and never even bothered to reestablish any of my beatmatching talents because I could beatgrid and master sync.

I always thought to myself

Last weekend I'm at a house party with my friend playing. I hop on the decks just to mess around and his setup is just two CDJ MKIII's with a random mixer with a BPM counter.

Even with the BPM counter I could just NOT get my shit together. Traktor has spoiled me and now I'm what I used to hate most. Someone who relies on technology and cant 'kick it old school' so to speak.

So now what I'm looking for is kind of a 'workflow' on how to beatmatch naturally. Sorry if I use outdated terminology below but I'll attempt to describe what I attempt to do. I'm starting to realize I'm having difficulty picking up the 'ear' to tell if I need to speed the track up or slow it down. I'm having a big issue with telling which baseline belong to which track so I cant tell if the queued track is ahead or behind of the live track.

So I'm playing typical house music with a 125-132ish BPM. 

Track A is playing live through the monitors (let's assume 128 BPM).

Both tables are set at a 0.0% tempo slider so they are both at their 'stock' BPM

I que up track B to the first beat and then let tracks A and B run through my headphones.

I count down the end of the 32 bar measure of track A and get ready to play track B (not live

so I count down 5,8 and on beat 1 of track A I hit play on track B.

This is where all hell breaks loose (obviously lol)!

Now I'm in the middle of a train wreck in my headphones and I need to get the tracks beatmatched then go back and redrop track B on Tracks A's '1 beat' to have them matched and in phase.

This is where I simply cannot tell if track B is ahead or behind track A because there is just SO much going on.

So I try trial and error.

The first step...is assuming possibility they are already somewhat close to the same 'natural' BPM and I may have just played track B too early or too late to coincide with the 1 beat on track A.

So I spin track B's side platter ahead slightly to do pitch adjust and see what I got. If that makes it worse

If they just can't seem to get in phase

So I'll slide Track B's Tempo up +1% and repeat the process of dropping it on the 1.

I'll do the same platter spins and see what I get. If not then I'll repeat the process but with track B's tempo now at -1%. Same deal with the platters.

I'll repeat this process going 

+2%/-2%
+3%/-3% etc etc

This is wayyyyy too much trial and error and is just taking too much time. I know conceptually what I'm doing will work...but when doing a mix it can be a crunch for time so I need to figure out the error in my workflow process.

So what am I missing here guys? Obviously practicing

1356276551.0,15btlk,Not sure how much anyone cares but here's the story of my first time playing out...,LB2475,17,4,22,"I was asked to play an end of the world party Friday night with two other dj's with me being the last to play. I got there hella early with dj #2 to help set up

So skip forward to like midnight when Dj #2 is gonna get on. He was only going to play for 45 minutes as a kind of transition from the first guys 140 bpm trap down to me being able to start with some moombah and work my way into the faster trap and dubstep stuff. Unfortunately like 20 minutes into his set the cops show up. One of the hosts goes outside for a few minutes and talks to the cop and we have to turn it down. Dj #2 got pissed though because he tried to keep playing when the cop arrived and someone killed the fader he was playing through on the main mixer(DJ #1's djm900) so as a result of him getting angry he said fuck it unplugged all his shit and set it back behind the booth somewhere. 

I hurried in pulled my laptop out plugged it in, and dj #2 throwing a hissy fit bummed everyone out. I played as much popular music as I could but could only get 3 or 4 girls dancing and a few of the ghetto dudes screaming OOOHHHHH when I would play a song they got off to.  I had a bunch of people that kept asking for ""black people music"" so I'd let them look at my playlist of hip hop and rap, they'd pick a song I would play it they would keep coming back. Fucking annoying and dj #2 was supposed to keeping people from back behind me but he was off drinking himself into a stupor in a fit of anger. 

Anyways I got them off my back and got to play what I wanted for about 15 minutes or so and a guy comes up and wants to ""freestyle"". He was the hosts cousin or something so I was forced to oblige. He said he wanted a futuristic beat like dubstep to rap over. O.o I'm like da fuq?! so I give him a minimal house loop which he said he liked and he started trying to rap over 128 bpm house music. He lasted all of 30 seconds before he started getting boo'd and I said fuck it and played mercy because everyone likes that I guess and I needed to go in another direction asap. So he was pissed because I said it was a ""wack"" beat even though I had let him listen to it in my headphones before playing it and he said he liked it. Wtf.

After this is when shit really hits the fan. I got all the assholes out of the booth and was prepping another song when DJ #2 comes up and asks for me to hand him his laptop. I look behind me and his laptop and mixtrack pro are fucking gone. Literally just bare wall space where they'd been less than an hour before. He flipped shit. Dj #1 came up at this point and said to kill my music and lets find his shit. So I did but first I took all my stuff to the car because if someone was willing to steal once they'd do it again. I come back in to dj #1 playing fucking hardwell or something. He just wanted to play again and kinda tricked me into giving up my set. Whatever I'm over it. My ride home was dj #2 and when he gets pissy he's an asshole to everyone around him. I just wanted to get the fuck out of there without getting jacked. haha.

Whatever. we get the promoter to get on the mic and make an announcement. He offers a $50 gift card to a local club to anyone who finds the laptop at the very least. We stick around for maybe an hour after that trying to find the shit and it never shows. We say fuck it and while we're trying to turn around in his car to get out of there his car gets stuck in the mud with the tires spinning. Fuck. So I spend the next 30 minutes trying to get people outside to help push this dudes car out of the mud and we finally get a group of guys. it's like 4 a.m. now and dj #2 and I are pissy

Okay that whole last paragraph was just a rant about shit but whatever. the night was wack. I had a great time though even though the homies stuff is long gone. Wish I'd gotten to play more and hadn't gotten harassed so much to play rap. Whatever. awesome shit.

I'll make some more vids this weekend and post them here for you guys, but in the meantime here's my reply to what the volume fader allows you to do. A nice 2 1/2 minute mix from one track to the other. 

As for the fader thing

http://soundcloud.com/djkennyfox/kenny-fox-live-8-26

Listen from 6 minutes on and try to hear what I'm doing. Keep in mind I'm just describing mixer controls and loops here

Track 1 is called shook up

6:00 - shook up is playing by itself
6:20 - shook up's breakdown begins
6:34 - I begin using volume slams to add in a bass beat to the buildup of shook up. This happens till about 7:07
6:55 - really chopping up the bass beats of pizzicato you can hear the adding in best here because it's slightly off
7:07 - both tracks are now playing
@7:49 or close - begin using a couple bass cutouts
8:27 - catch shook up in a one beat slip loop. When loop cuts out after looping part
8:35 or so - fade shook up out as pizzicato builds
9:03 - only pizzicato playing. 

Keep in mind I've been using loops to extend the mix the entire time

So about five months ago [I posted this in this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/wbaym/urgent_newbie_needs_to_be_able_to_perform_in_five/)

Through the next five months, but also where I would need to go after that. I looked up tutorials on youtube, djtechtools, and I would quite often come across tips from people asking the same questions here that I was wondering myself. Whenever I got stuck I would ask a question here or in some of the other djing/production subreddits, and you guys were always quick to point me in the right direction

[This is a picture of me at the dance.](http://i.imgur.com/bQIRE.jpg) For anyone confused

The ""DJing"" schtick was more just a way to add to the atmosphere of the night, so there was no way I could screw up.

At least

As it turns out, when I ran out of pre-mixed sets (I had only mixed 3 and a half hours), I used my APC40 with Traktor Pro to perform the last bit of the night live, ending with Mariah Carey's All I Want is You. When I wasn't using traktor, all I was doing was just layering on effects (not TOO heavily, just every now and then) and pressing buttons/twiddling knobs that were macroed to nothing in order to fool anyone watching.

----------------------------------
**anyways** *(if you're disappointed by anything you've read skip to this part)*

----------------------------------
What I got out of this night was people having lots of fun. A song would come up and everyone would light up and yell ""OH MY GOD IT'S THIS SONG!!!"" They'd sing along, they'd socialize, they loved it. And I loved it.

For the next dance the local fandom has, but because I love the feel of feeding people music and them having a good time as a result. **I love DJing.**

The scariest part of the night was pressing play. The rest was just fun.

I couldn't have done this without the help and support of everyone in this subreddit. You guys are awesome. Merry Christmas.

Well,  more like telling you my story:

I recently decided to do a new mix (so I can get some feedback etc)

**Might it be that I'm not using them with efficience yet (due to me only being a sprout in this business)? ** 

I just use these cuepoints to know where to start the next song; a cuepoint in the end of the song is like a flag that tells me ""in 4 beats you should press start on the other song"". And then I got another cuepoint as the starting point of the other song (before a ""drop"" for example). 

When I recorded my mix I just sat, EQ and rais the volume at the same time. I guess that I prefer to just choose a couple of songs and mix them together by ear and with the guts, it makes me get that little nervous feeling and that adrenaline that makes your whole body tickle.

---------------------------------
I'm a resident DJ at a club and due to people quitting and availability I'm DJing by myself 1 sometimes 2 nights a week. DJing alone for 6 hours sucks like you can't imagine. 

The only person i know, he'd have a job.

I know at least 1-2 other DJs in my position and i know it happens. Go out, don't hound them for a spot, just casually tell them if they ever need someone to open, you'd gladly help out to learn from them.

Trust me, he asks us what we think.

The guy i have right now only knows how to DJ using serato itch, except a few EDM places which only use CDjs. If you own a serato box, it literally takes 2 min to set it up and go about your set.

For good DJs looking for a main spot. Make sure you don't come with a 200$ controller and a laptop. If you're not dedicated to buying proper hardware, every good DJ i know is using turntables or CDjs -- generally with ssl.

**edit on controllers**


Paying $2000 vs $200 is much more of a commitment that less people are willing to make. Generally those who do, you're better. I've seen a guy DJing with only a sample-board and tracktor with 4 decks and he did an awesome job. I've also seen people with turntables who think they can scratch and made everyone's ears bleed. 

Hope this helps some of the guys out there trying to get in. Make friends and know what you're doing. Keep showing up at the club and it will happen for sure.

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

So what is stage presence exactly?  Well to put it simply it's your ability to connect with people and put a ""face"" to the music.  Freddie Mercury, Prince - these are all guys with incredible charisma on stage.  They don't just sing their songs, they OWN them.  They convince you that there's no one on this planet who can deliver their song better than they can.

Now fine.  ""But these guys are singers

Fun fact - some of the most renowned DJs today have great stage presence.  I personally get a lot out of watching guys like Carl Cox, Araabmusik... I'm sure there's plenty of good examples.  Now a lot of that doesn't necessarily have to do with their music.  I don't enjoy Skrillex in the studio too much but his concerts are totally nuts.  And yes, he has a million dollars worth of visuals and lights and stuff, but anyway...

Stage presence is important and it will help you stand out from the 20 other DJs (who are just as capable) that don't have it.  That's the bottom line.

So how does one get a stage presence?  


**Step 1: Know what you are doing** 

It goes without saying that you have to be very good at what you do before you can even think about what you look like.  I can say from personal experience that thinking about your mixing


**Step 2: Believe in yourself**

If you don't have confidence it can be very difficult to look like you do.  Maybe you're Michael Cera


**Step 3: Connect with people**

You are a DJ.  You are playing music FOR PEOPLE.  If you pretend your audience doesn't exist 90% of the time they'll pay a lot less attention to you.  Aphex Twin is the only performer I've seen who can pull off the arrogant

Now these 3 tips aren't the be-all and end-all but they're a really good starting point for building your stage presence.  Have fun with it - recognize that what works for some DJs or genre of music won't work well for others.

All of the columns above are able to be filtered to include or exclude any selection that you may want.  Say you're working on a techno mix for a gig where you are the opener.  You decide that you really only want to play techno so you filter out all house

All columns are able to be sorted from big to small, say, a song without scrolling or going through endless filters.  I've also included a spot that calculates the average BPM of whatever BPMs you have filtered.  If you have your whole library open it tells the average BPM of all your tunes.  If you only have banging dubstep tracks selected it changes to show only the selected ranges BPM.  Maybe this could be used to pick a good set tempo.  Also, anything new that you add to any field will be filterable or searchable after it's entered.  So when you add new artists or genres, etc. you can filter or search for it without doing anything extra.

It was a chill party which would have a lot of freshmen and probably no dance floor so I just brought my laptop equipped with Traktor. When I got there they sat me at a table and I felt like I was tabling at a fair or something. There was a 2.1 computer speaker system which was fine; I wasn't expecting anything better. I started off playing some lower BPM (~100) tunes and felt alright. 

One of the party hosts who I didn't know too well immediately started requesting stuff which would have been all very well if she wasn't so patronizing about it. She asked ""Don't you have X?"" to which I responded that I had a set list prepared and everything. To this she said ""Well, but when I gradually increased the BPM, people started swaying a bit but I was really frustrated because everyone just seemed super awkward (freshmen!) and more like they were preoccupied with impressing each other than having fun.

The computer speakers didn't reach to the living room (I was in the dining room/kitchen area, so I did, but still no one seemed affected by my music.

My friend had moved his Top 40 back to the kitchen, and several people seemed to be actually dancing to it! There was even a painfully awkward freshman couple grinding. At this point I got kind of pissed off and just left the party because it was a lame party and I wasn't getting paid anyway. At least a couple people seemed disappointed that I was leaving.

Oh well. Better luck next time? D:

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

([Previous thread - Week of 7/1/2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1hfj9j/weekly_mix_feedback_thread_712013/?sort=new) )

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  We are taking some cues from /r/edmproduction here


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Unfortunately

The first time it went into protect mode, because I turned the receiver off and back on, then turned down the levels a bit and it worked like a charm. The second and third time it happened, I was trying to make the drop in the last song louder, and my plan backfired :( But thanks to all of you encouraging each other how to troubleshoot gear, I was able to get back and running without the manager helping me with the unfamiliar sound system :)

Not gonna lie, hit play, and let it roll. I kind of had the nervous shakes for the first few minutes, but the manager (also my boss because I work there), brought me a drink and it helped loosen me up. Another one from a coworker who was there to party, and the shakes were gone for good! I started mixing at about 10:30 or 11, and went until 2am when the bar closed. All and all it was a good set (minus that damn protect mode issue)

2. Say you have two tracks and you've adjusted the tempos to be v.close to eachother, but how do you do that DURING a mix without the audience hearing the 'galloping' beats. Or are you just supposed to line it up perfectly before you start mixing and hope to finish the mix before the difference in tempos becomes apparent?

I have a question about mixing

I'm thankfully at the stage now where I'm DJing at a few more venues these days, where-ever you find a set of DJ decks, you tend to find what's called a 'booth monitor'. This is simply a speaker in your DJ booth which is used when you're mixing, so that you can more accurately hear what the mix sounds like).

Now, and at one other event. Every other time, I've not had one. This isn't necessarily a problem, but as many DJs will understand, it sounds reaaalllyyy weird when you're DJing behind club speakers or when your booth is far away from the speakers. 
So, in these situations, I tend to always keep my headphones on and not monitor at all. This is pretty bad isn't it? Is it possible that when I'm mixing purely on my headphones, it can sound good on my headphones but awful on a bigger sound system? 
Is the best way to judge just by simply listening to the 'weird' mixing behind the speakers?

I hope experienced DJs understand me when I say it sounds odd mixing from a different angle compared to the actual speakers!

------------

So a little while ago this group i was with was holding a party. I don't know if any of you read homestuck but this group (of over 400 members) is based around that comic, if any of you guys listened to a song or two there, you probably didn't hit the &lt;10% of the songs that are decent at a dance, and probably hit the other &gt;90% that kind of kill the mood. Seeing this, i jumped onto the laptop and played music from my ipod and watched the crowd. I played fast dance music when the energy was building, slow when i saw people getting romantic, fillers when people were out taking a breather, but better than leaving homestuck music on shuffle. There was speculation that there would be another dance in the winter

--------

My plan is to learn how to be a semi-decent DJ by December and use ableton live and a MIDI pad controller to create an awesome time for everyone involved. I am serious about DJing in general, if i'm still serious about this in a few months.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T9O60Q/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER)

--------

**What i know (or think i know)**

I can count beats. I can follow the Camelot wheel. [I've made a shitty mashup with the worst ending ever.](http://www.thebackalleys.com/dump/player.php?f=9692) I've been messing around in virtualDJ but i want to switch over to Ableton Live 8. I've been doing a lot of tutorials in Ableton to figure out the program

--------

So here's what I need. I need to know how I can move forward, anything i should know about ableton, basically all the info I can get. Maybe a critique on my shitty mashup if you'd be so kind :]

Finally here are a few questions that have been bumping around my head:

1: Why are there sometimes two people at the DJ stand? What does the second guy do?

2: What are some good sites for instrumentals and/or acapellas? I know about acapellas4u but that's about it

3: How do I transition to songs with different keys or tempos?

4: How do i transition songs in general

5: [Is this legit at all? It seems legit](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/how-to-digital-dj-fast-cb/)

Now

Option one: Mixes are no longer allowed as straight submissions. If you were to post a link to your soundcloud/mixcloud mix it would be removed. There would be a weekly feedback thread somewhat reminiscent of r/edmproduction's where we post comments with our mixes inside the thread.

The major downsides I see to this option are increased moderation and weekly feedback thread drama. In [/r/EDMproduction](/r/EDMproduction) people will occasionally downvote all posts but theirs so they gain more exposure. While this probably wouldn't happen in r/beatmatch, we would most likely need another moderator due to real life constraints of the current ones. Small issue, but w/e.

Option two: Keep it as is and allow mix submission. Purely self-promotional things will still be taken down

3) I am correct in think that when I get my actual equipment that this wont really be an issue? Will I be able to listen to one thing and make the loop while the other song is still playing to the audience?

4) Is it good to learn with VDJ before buying equipment? Taking into account the questions above.

5) Are there any good youtube tutorials? Which do you reccomend?

6) What is the major difference between using the crossfader as opposed to using the 2 volume slides right 
above it?

7) Currently, then just doing my best to match and play smoothly, even if I am just cutting from one song directly to another as long as the beat is constant. Is this good? Is this what I should be doing to practice?

8) After getting down the previous questions

9a) On several videos that I watched, and lows. My Virtual DJ does not have those, I tried to get the skin (i forget the name atm) but it would not let me load it. Is there away to get around this aside from buying? 

9b) The video showed the DJ looping a beat and matching using just the base to match. This seems VERY important to me. Am I correct?

10) In my mind, and it is not obvious on how to do this looking at the VDJ UI.

11) Is there a program like VDJ that would replicate a drum machine? Is there a way to link the 2
I think that is enough for now

12) I did record the 2 songs I put together. I tried to upload it to soundcloud to share with people I know and to post on here for advice but when I uploaded it said it violated copyrights. Is soundcloud kind of the standard method of sharing

Here is a little background on myself to give you a little idea about where I am coming from. I am sure not everyone is interested in this so if you don't care just skip this. I grew up in a musical family and played music through out my childhood through my young twenties. I have played everything from Piano, but most extensively drums. I was raised by MTV and actually watched ""Video killed the radio star"" on it's first live broadcast. I was glued to MTV until it became more reality tv than videos. I am all about the radio (of any style) and have ""studied"" top 40 my entire life. Why it took me until the age of 34 to get started DJing is beyond me. In my mind right now there are several different styles of ""show"" that I want to do. I want to mix rap and dnb (with the though being ""Fixing current rap songs""), mix 80s and 90s Dance and House, then this other over the top thing that involves DJing, but is more of a stage show. I figure mixing Dance and House would be the best start for me to learn about what is going on and explore what kind of DJing I want to do. In the long run i want to write my own beats, but I understand that is something I shouldn't worry about right now. I have used a drum machine before and I have a little more of a clue with that. I have actually wrote music before, I understand how to read music

I want to thank you guys ahead of time for helping me out and answering my noobish questions. I don't know any DJs so this is really the only place I know of where I can ask these questions. I really appreciate all the help and I will do my best to make you guys proud.",self,t5_2syix,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/lbelz/first_beats_matched_now_i_have_a_million_questions/

[Hopefully this will work](http://soundcloud.com/beep-boop-deet-deet/forp-the-macroeconomics-of)

I've had a copy of Virtual DJ for about a year that I monkey around with in my spare time. I'm well aware that it's kind of ""baby's first DJ software"" but I haven't taken this any more seriously than just something fun to do so I haven't looked into other software too seriously.  However, rather than just the consumption (where most of my experience lays), of mixes would have to say.

For controls, but that I would probably do well to learn how to use jogwheels and other useful things at some point if I were to get another midi controller.

And then you have me: My passion is EDM: Trance, House, Ambient, Hardstyle; pretty much everything not heavy dubstep. Recently I've even acquired a taste for Old School Rap and Drum and Bass. These are all genres nobody wants to listen to. Historically I'd play the first hour or so at my own house parties, tell people who complained to fuck off, its my house or that I'm new, and once the party started going hand things over to some friends who play popular dubstep and rap. The crowd for my set is ""this is alright I guess (maybe)"" to ""whhhaaaa

I could play the popular stuff

([Previous thread - Week of 6/24/2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1gzcub/weekly_mix_feedback_thread_6242013/?sort=new) )

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  We are taking some cues from /r/edmproduction here


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

the third was well timed and I think the best in my mix.

the fourth worked but wasn't really good.

At the fifth the two tracks didn't really work together very well.

the ninth was a bit aggressive maybe.

Text (~~Optional~~): &lt;====Not optional anymore!!

Hey guys I put together this mix today to show you my skills in beatmatching and fading

Trans - 3:54 - 4:21

Bombs Away - Party Bass (Krunk Remix)

Trans - 5:25 - 5:40

Lucky Date - I Want You (Vengence Remix)

I thought my mix flowed well and there weren't any frequency clashes. 

[End Post]




As the OP I put a lot of work into my submission text which shows I am willing to put in effort to receive feedback

You don't actually have to give me feedback this is just an example (you can if you want to practice giving feedback) but I think this could set a new standard for quality submissions.

Of course my mix was only very short and power mixed together but from those 5 or so transitions you can already judge my skill level and help me improve. Of course you don't know if I can play for an hour or 3 but if I take these basic principles and just practice then I could play forever

So let me know your thoughts on this and hopefully the mods will weigh in with their opinions. 

I love all you guys (No homo) :D

Some of the links are dead, so you can see what is there first.

Who should use these as they are: CDJ spinners who only have limited BPM range for Beatmatching because of deck limitations (no keylock

I noticed several with poor fidelity

They are good for a listen though

I don't think there's anything here that can't be done in traktor with tracks live. These are the kind of tricks and dramatic changes we're really striving for

It had never even occurred to me that someone might use cue points in that manner; in the odd cases where I have more than one cue point in a track (99.99% of my tracks only have the first beat cue pointed) I've put the cue point on some vocal or musical riff in a track so that I can use it like a sample. For instance

In my mind using cue points to tell you when and where to start mixing in another track or line up another track removes all spontaneity from DJing. So

One big complaint that we've heard about mixes by newer DJs is that they only play songs by the big name artists.  A major part of DJing is data digging (crate digging in the modern area) and it's time to develop that skill with this month's challenge: Small Fry.  You can ONLY play songs by artists whose pages have less than 5000 Facebook likes.

Here are this month's rules:

 * Your mix can be no longer than 15 minutes
 * You must tag transition times and songs on the mix itself (doesn't have to be mix cloud this month
 * You can ONLY play songs by producers whose Facebook page has less than 5000 likes - Please include links to their facebook in your submission
 * Submissions close at 10 PM Pacific Time on Tuesday July 23rd
 * You will be required to leave feedback on 2 other mixes **in the voting thread**

Voting thread will be posted shortly after submissions close.

1366431224.0,1cq2c5,Two beginner questions about phrase matching (examples inside),kneeMonster,7,0,7,"Hi Beatmatch (to skip the intro go to paragraph 3ish for actual questions)

I recently purchased a novation twitch and for the first week or so I spent most of my time playing with slicer mode, and (as to not get overwhelmed with options from the get go) reducing my electronic music library down to a more manageable size (from ~500 songs to 53) so I can focus more on actually knowing the songs compared to ""liking"" the songs. Also I am using serato Itch instead of traktor because the default traktor mapping isn't quite to my liking and I would rather keep it simpler at the start (although I really do miss the dedicated filter knob, it is was too much fun to play with).

Anyways, to learn with and hopefully come up with some interesting sounds. The problem I noticed was that even though in my head what I'm doing should work, the mix never really sounds right. 

After googling around and searching this and other forums for beginners I realized that I don't have much of a clue about phrase matching. I spent a good chunk of time today reading up on it, this is just what I've noticed after a few hours today).

The two songs I'm talking about can be found in /r/elctrohouse vol 24

1. Youtube - [Better Wipe that Up (Revolver Remix) - Lazy Rich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58nJJ5gZDLw)
- Thread to dl - [Link to /r/electrohouse vol 24 compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/lysc7/relectrohouse_volume_24_is_here/)

To me it sounds like the first phrase is 8 bars long and ends around the 15 second mark. The second phrase then seems to be 24 bars and end around 1:00. Everything I've seen suggests phrases are in the vein of 4, and 32 bars. Am I counting this wrong, is this song a rare exception, or is that rule more of a guideline?

2. Youtube - [Party Bass (Reece Low Remix) - Bombs Away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BgbezbK4v8)
- Thread to dl - [Link to /r/electrohouse vol 31 compilation](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/13k2lm/relectrohouse_weekly_compilation_31_14th_21st/)

For this song the first phrase sounds like 16 bars (0-:30), it sounds like at the end of a lot of phrases the sound begins to subtly change so it flows into the next phrase smoothly. Does that sound correct?

I apologize for the wall of text and what I am sure are pretty simple questions

Feel free to post any helpful hints/tricks you have learned while working with phrasing while you're here.

Would really appreciate some starter help/advice.  Deets inside.,Dont_PlagiarizeMeBro,12,3,10,"* Jump down to the next bullet point if you don't want to read any bullshit.  plz and thx.

Alright so a brief history.  Pretty much since i heard my first Svenson &amp; Gielen track about a decade ago i've been a fan of edm.  i only say this because edm has been blowing up on the east coast recently and i don't want you guys to think i'm one of those 'omg skrillex and lmfao are da bomb i wanna be a super fist pumper like pauly d and get all da bitches'.  not that theres anything wrong with that i guess.  but i come from a place of love for the music and have a sense of belonging since ive been in the scene (or what there was of one) for a while and was mostly ridiculed for listening to trance/electro back in high school and shit.  

Originally I wanted to get into producing music rather than dj'ing because i always wanted to create music instead of playing someone else's.  So ive been making music for pushing 6 years now and just love it.  Now i've seen some of the creative things people are able to do with mixers

Unfortunately I don't run in a crowd that is into djing or anything creative musically so i'm looking to you fine passionate people for help.  


* alright enough of that shit.  heres the deal.  

Out of the blue i was talking to some randoms at a party and was able to pick up a djm 800 from a guy for really really cheap.  at this point i had done some research and when i found out he would sell it to me for $400 i jumped at it.  

So... thats where i'm at right now.  

my question to you fine people is what my next step should be.  i'm not trying to jump into playing clubs i just want to start mixing music and hopefully remixing songs if possible.

i'm totally overwhelmed by all the products out there and don't even know if my djm 800 purchase was a wise one.  

so should i buy some turntables?  cdjs?  what kind of software is recommended?  

i have an opportunity to pick up some cdj 1000 mk3s for about $1200.  anyone have experience with those?  would it be a good purchase?

any and all information yall are willing to provide will be greatly appreciated.

So, it has two...fake? turntables that each can have a cd or memory stick loaded into and you can fade between, adjust pitch, cue, scratch, etc.. He really enjoyed playing with it, though both of us sounded like a couple of idiots on it. I can't find it on their website, or what it's called. Anyways


I come to you now, will want him to start on a couple turntables, but is that the only approach? Would this electronic setup, or something similar, be a decent way to start out?

Thanks in advance!

I want to start this post by saying that i've searched the forums

My setup currently consists of Traktor kontrol S2, so i will have to invest in a laptop quite soon.

I would be interested on people's personal experiences who have bought laptops for DJ purposes during the past year or so. 

So many things have changed with laptops since i last looked at them


When i look at the traktor specs

Specs:

Windows 7 or 8 (latest Service Pack, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended) 

Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8 (latest update)
General: Monitor with 1024 x 768 screen resolution, high-speed internet required 


I am on a very low budget here


Necessities i've gathered from other posts:

1368 x 768 resolution minimum

4gb Ram.

Windows 7

Decent amount of hard drive. (is SSD A good idea?)



How about the touch screen ones? Has anyone tried using them? Do they work in Dj'ing? I am quite keen on getting away from the touchpad.

Currently none of my gear needs firewire

Is ASUS still a good brand?

How about toshiba/samsung? (i can see some decent looking options in one of the local stores for less than 400€.

I am under the impression that many say that any laptops will do

Macbook, and will become a fileserver whenever i can get myself a macbook.

It is highly possible that i have screwed up something while searching the forums

Welcome to the Weekly Mix Feedback thread on r/beatmatch!  This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.  Mix posts that are not in this thread will be removed.  If you submit your mix


These threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.   This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   

Rules:

* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.

* [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, be sure to include a tracklist.  

* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn’t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions.   Feel free to also link to a few instances where you provided someone else good feedback.  Being active in these threads should encourage more people to listen to your mix.

Currently I have some super basic CD decks (Numark NDX400s) and a very basic 4 channel mixer (Numark M6). I mess around on these to work on the basics, etc. I got these as a starting point to learn basics

However, I want to start building for the future. Like many folks, I never have a ton of money at any one point. Outside of the laptop, I've been looking at more accessible ways to build a setup that I want, while still keeping my options open.

Now, putting together layers, acapellas, etc. It certainly doesn't have to be exclusively this, but it's what has me most interested right now. That being said, I've also become more interested vinyl, as a medium. A out of town friend has a pair of Tech 12's that he isn't using

Basically I'm wondering if others have a similar type of setup, and would like to include Ableton at some point along the way.

/
/
/

The gear ideas

Laptop: MacBook Pro - Birthday is coming up and this is tops on the list. Looking at used ones. Aiming for 8gb of RAM, but would settle for the 13"" for now. Don't think the Retina screen is a necessity. Thoughts?

Mixer: Numark M6 - Basic, USB. Already have it, no need to upgrade from here yet.

Controller 1: Traktor Kontrol X1 - This would be my deck controls, does what it needs to. Will likely get this to get me started and become more intimate with the Traktor program and controls.

Controller 2: Novation Launchpad - With the unlocking of the Remix decks, customizations. Added bonus of getting into the production side of things, coming with Ableton Intro, and doubles as a controller with that.

Audio Interface: NI Audio 2 - Basic, as I will likely buy a Kontrol X1 new.

/
/
/
/

From here, all for something around ~$200. If I enjoy the vinyl thing, I could pick up something like a Z2, although that would go more into the ""larger purchases"" category. I could add a MIDI Fighter or something similar if I wanted to do some finger drumming, or go with an APC40 if Ableton becomes my thing.

Adding a MIDI keyboard is also an option

Upgrades along the way would likely be to the mixer

If I end up playing out (which I do aim to do) I wouldn't have to bring a ton of stuff with me, I may only need one of them. I've also looked into doing the mobile DJing thing a bit, more so as a means for income to do the shows that I WANT to play.

Anyways

Is it with the track lists? He has very good tracklists that despite some Cringe worthy transitions (not common place) his sets are nice to listen to
Can someone shed some light on that over powered bass that is in his live sets?

The first transition went pretty good i think. 

The second one was a bit messy. 

The third and fourth were a bit too sudden. 

During Return Of The Funk the reverb just randomly popped to 70.

The fifth transition worked pretty good because of the same sounds.

So my question for those who have experience with it is: how often is are they a defective product, how long does it last? Is there a manufacturers waranty? How likely is a local music store to provide warranties? Are there other controllers worth getting in my situation (budget up to $150 for just controller)?

I'm fully aware of the mistakes but I need you guys to point out some obviously correctable mistakes so I can continue practicing with the right techniques and mindset. 

Some obvious mistakes are when I was tempted to switch back to the previous song because I don't have a midi controller or splitter to preview the other deck. This a bad habit I've developed to make up for the lack of sampling and I need help correcting it.

Some key things that I noticed: 

* **0:00** - Kinda lame intro
* **7:23** - I was freaking the fuck out here because I cued Mode too early. 
* **17:00** - I jumped back to Lunar by accident.
* **18:20** - Realized jumping back to Lunar would be awesome
* **20:00** - Pretty freaking bad
* **21:59** - Was this too sudden?
* **23:03** - Wanted to jump back to Red Line
* **30:12 - 31:18** - Was really unsure of how I wanted to mix in Bass Cannon
* **44:00** - Not proud of that mix-in.
* **44:38** - Should have transitioned 4 beats earlier. Throws the mix off for the next 2 minutes. 
* **48:50** - I don't even...
* **53:40** - No excuse here. That was just unacceptable bad.

If there's anything else

* **I will add more as I re-listen to the mix.**

1373114859.0,1hqvl7,Beginner aspiring Bedroom/Party DJ looking for advice,The_Ion_Shake,6,1,16,"Hey

I'm completely new to DJing and want a bit of advice as to what gear I need. Now I apologise in advance for how n00bish and possibly unrealistic my expectations or thoughts are. Now, and this is probably going to sound a bit douchey, but I would like to be able to DJ to impress friends and be a bit of a hit at parties and 'show off' my music more than just sharing it online, as well as playing popular 'club' music. Once again, probably a bit douchey but I've been inspired by Skrillex to give it a go, because I hear his story was that he managed to do it just using Ableton and not really being a DJ before. 

So, you can DJ using an iPad and basic decks now, right? A CDJ would be a little excessive for what I'd want to do? They're $1000+. Plus there's probably an app for a beatpad so you wouldn't really need the controller, yeah (although it looks like it'd be really helpful for Ableton)? I don't want to pay a boatload of money and then realise that i'd never really use it and it'd be a passing phase of mine, or I'd have equipment worth far in excess of what I'd need. I'm more interested in the performance side of it so I'd be after something that looks cool. I'm aware you can probably even do much of what I'd want with just an iPad these days but try telling people you ""DJ a bit"" and will DJ their party, and show up with just an iPad and they'll think you're having a laugh. This sort of thing looks like what I'd be interested in: http://www.americanmusical.com/Item--i-PIO-XDJAERO-LIST?src=W1107DJBE1107DJA&amp;utm_source=djbooth&amp;utm_medium=homepagebanner&amp;utm_campaign=product especially with the ability to use your phone as a bit of a remote. 

But at $1000 it's far too much for me right now at this early stage. So really, and a laptop with Traktor or something), something I can mix with that has decent enough features and something that is respectable and professional-looking and not a 'toy"" where I have to actually do something more than press 'play', but yet something that is pretty cheap. 

Also, for cool points....they usually just have a laptop open playing an iTunes setlist so having a dedicated decent DJ for free would be a godsend in their eyes), is it possible or a bit unrealistic to expect to be reasonably good enough to be able to perform live by then with a bit of practice and determination?

Lastly, so like one song's lyrics with the music of another, and bits of the two, but from what I read it sounds like just playing one song, and then seamlessly playing a similar BPM song after and really you need to make the songs using Ableton etc beforehand and then piece it together at the show to make it seem like you're not just pressing 'play'. I don't want to be the gimmicky guy that just remixes the 'hits' but I don't get how to make your own thing using DJing rather than Ableton. I've tried ""mixing"" similar sounding songs on my computer and it just sounds like two songs playing over the top of each other. I just don't get how you do it. And since songs have different structures obviously one chorus is going to be a different length to another song's, so they won't line up when you switch them over. Is the reality that you just have to use two very similar songs, or can you mix the beat from The Next Episode with California Love or something? Is it a lot easier to just choose songs without words or one with

The second song on that album (time lapse) is listed as 87bpm which sounds correct if I change my metronome to be 8/8. It also sounds correct of I double the bpm to 174bpm. 

This is probably more of a music general question but is an 8 beat measurement at 87bpm the same as 174 at 4/4?

Is there a reason the songs are labeled differently in their bpm?

Doing this live at a party or something would probably be boring and I'd be better off playing just a prerecorded set if anything. 

So my question is, etc.). Anything that's different than just bringing in a new song as one kind of dies out and playing with the volume/crossfader.  How can I keep my mixing dynamic and exciting, especially for doing something live? When I try out something new (for example, setting a cue point through a song and jumping back to that cue point a few times quickly, it sounds okay, mediocre at best, but overall just not that great). Any suggestions/help on improving? At this point it feels like I'm just choosing songs and putting them into one continuous mix, but if I wanted to mix at a live party

I don't want to have to hold the button down to play it through, but if this is the only way I can, then fine. This all seemed a lot simpler with sample decks, with the new remix decks I've no real idea what I'm doing.
* Any tips for using samples in an interesting way? What sounds the best? Do you use them? If so, or what should I *not* do?

I will definaly apply these to my produced tracks. However when I comes to a DJ mix that I just output as a .wav file straight out of Tracktor: Before uploading to the internet is there any essential things that people do to the track just to make it sound that little bit better? Normalizing? Adding steroscopic effects? EQing? 

It feels this after-editing is considered cheating but obviously I want it to sound the best as possible on a wide range of systems.

So I can get a Traktor Z2 for $650 with a hookup at Guitar Center, maybe a little more.

I'm not what anyone would consider a great DJ (yet!), it seemed way too easy and in my opinion I'm not learning how to properly beatmatch and focus on the basic art of dj'ing. I really want to learn the ""traditional"" way.

I know with the Z2, that alone would be another $450 ish on top of the 42 if I wanted to use traktor. The thing that is attractive about the 42, is it's 4-channel (not 2+2), so down the line I could learn mixing four way, and maybe think of getting at least one CDJ to learn that for club-mixing (I have that opportunity already, just am not super comfortable with my skill level).

Going further down the traditional route, and probably will learn scratching hip-hop for fun, but that's not the kind of music I produce or DJ. For a non-laptop setup, I think the Xone 42 would blow the water out of the Z2 as far as sound quality and hardware effects. (for the type of stuff i spin, effects aren't used too much either probably)

Should I wait and save money? Buy the Z2 now? Maybe buy the 42

Soundcloud link: https://soundcloud.com/slowbrohime/february-s3rl-mix


Tracklist and approximate transition times:

    00:00 Same Never Changed (feat. Tami)
    02:00 My Lucky Star
    04:55 Less Than 3
    07:12 It Went
    09:15 Here We Go
    12:08 I Live for the Bass
    15:05 Say My Name Bitch
    17:10 Martinis &amp; Mixed Feelings
    19:15 Space Invader
    20:58 MTC
    22:53 Bad Boy
    26:02 Feel the Melody
    28:05 Snow White Line


My thoughts on the transitions (using the transition times):

2:00

* Overall pretty good
* I think the actual move from Same Never Changed into My Lucky Star was pretty spiffy.


4:55

* One of the best from this mix.
* I may have killed My Lucky Star a tad too quick; I was afraid of some vocal overlap.


7:12

* Another smooth one. Possibly the best in this mix


9:15

* Also pretty smooth.
* I should have killed It Went before the vocals came back


12:08

* A little vocal overlap at 12:15


15:05

* Also pretty good.. the initial introduction of Say My Name was a little choppy against I Live for the Bass



17:10

* Smoooooth as a really smooth thing. No complaints!


19:15

* Again


20:58

* A bit awkward with the vocal overlap.
* Killed the mid to minimize the overlap; I should have kept it going until the bass from MTC came in.


22:53

* Confession: I've used this exact transition before in the past and it was well-received.
* The beats were off by a tad


Side note: 25:40; failure to transition. ABORT!


26:02

* After I fixed the beatmachin'


28:05

* Actually moved into this song way too early into it. I wanted to end with *part* of this song.. not all 5 minutes.
* A bit of dissonance between this

around 40 seconds into this clip a slam transition is demonstrated:

he has a cue point set up for the new track but I just can't quite get down the seamlessness of the cut.  I am able to make very solid slam transitions if I line up the end of the previous tracks 32 count with the beginning of the new tracks 32 count because the song makes it so easy for me to know when to switch.

however

are there any specific tricks/techniques to make these seamless?  Should the second track actually be cued up so that the beat you are trying to hit has just passed?

+ Club-Standard or very close to it

I'm trying to build a budget DVS setup, or buy a cheaper scratch mixer only for scratching, like the new DJ Tech one I've been hearing some good things about. The innofader in the Xone 42 would be the same price as the Dj Tech mixer with an innofader already in it.

Ideally I'd like just one mixer

EDIT:I'm adding some more information.

My budget is $350 for a mixer
I was hoping for 3 channels (I want to do the Jeff Mills thing eventually with 3 turntables) but two I guess would be fine for now.

I was looking at the Behringer Nox303, a Pioneer 707, or an old Vestax mixer, which all go for under my budget in my area.

I'm primarily a mix DJ but I also want to scratch. Should I buy a scratch mixer to learn to scratch and mix on it or buy a mixing mixer and put in an innofader and scratch that way?

After having been techno/house fans for a very long time

Now we're searching eBay and the like for two players and a mixer so we can start our thing.

Problem is, and we are mainly checking out older/used Pioneer models - such as two CDJ-900s with a DJM-700 in between, because Pioneer seems to be a good brand.

Thing is this - I'd love to actually do it live

Only thing with doing it live is that I don't want the recording of the mix to have my talkbreaks, I want to offer a download of the mix without the interruptions for later listening.

So one remedy for this would be a setup where maybe the mic is plugged into a mixer, and this would be lost.

So I had this idea (also the**TL;DR**): Is there a way to record not the audio, etc (this is all done on the S4 with the browse button etc), such that the mix could be ""rendered"" later? This would give me the best of both worlds.

Like the title says I got my camera out and put together this video instead of just posting the mix so hopefully you might be able to pick up a technique or two. This way we all can learn :D.

This was my first real recorded mix with large BPM changes (128-&gt;174-&gt;120) which was quite challenging but good fun.

There was a bit of manual beatmatching to be done in some parts which makes it interesting :D.

I know the timing of Satisfaction went a little out about 5 seconds after I pressed play. I have no idea why but I tried re-recording and I still couldn't get it perfect. I think Rollup had a beat change during the transition :(.

I think all the songs are pretty fun (You get that with top 40 I suppose) and danceable. Feel free to download it too if you like.

I didn't do any crazy mixing and let the songs play out to really let the listener fall into the vibes of each song.  I tried to have it start off a bit darker and deeper as it builds into some more pounding beats with the Aaron Camz remix
