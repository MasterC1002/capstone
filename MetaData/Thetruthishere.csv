1336370988.0,tat59,ATTENTION ALL R/NOSLEEPERS,Positive0,341,81,123,"Well I just finished writing the 3rd and final edit for my Let's leave r/nosleep post in r/Nosleep, thank you for going through with this everyone,
1367972587.0,1dwdf8,My Skinwalker Encounter [ME] [FAM],redheadedalex,255,38,77,"So I posted here awhile back with some skinwalker stories and figured I would share more.  I am having a hard time remembering the stories told to me by my Navajo family

It started when my two brothers, so red dirt everywhere (Southern Utah....a majestically beautiful place, if you ever get a chance.)  We had some pistols and decided to go out and target practice.  We took our gear and some old targets to this place called ""Devil's Heartbeat.""  I had never been, but all three of them were familiar with the area.  It was a canyon about 200 feet deep.  We stayed on one end of the canyon, by the dropoffs, and to our left was the ravine, and about fifty feet over

The Navajo may disagree with historians on the Anasazi's origins and departure (according to Navajo legend, dishes, and food, and went into another dimension or some equivalent) but whatever the history, the Navajo do NOT like to wander in Anasazi ruins.  I never asked why, but figured it had something to do with disrespect, preserving history, none of the others cared a bit about these canyon ruins.  They were more interested in shooting pistols.

I could see old beds, cross the canyon floor, and then climb back up.  This was a bad idea for a million reasons, but it was like some obsession.  I can't explain the feeling.  It was like magnetism.  I wanted to be in those ruins and it wasn't just some touristy curiosity.  It felt like I was meant to go there.  I kept slipping and getting stuck on the rocks, and I was so frustrated I almost started crying.  Finally I was deterred by the unmistakable sound of a growl coming from the canyon floor below me.  There were trees down there so I couldn't see what was making the growl, but ""mountain lion"" immediately rose to mind and I got my ass back up the cliffside.  

I said nothing to the others, then a hoarse laugh.  Almost like a lion, and then a hyena.  We had a clear view of the entire area and there was nothing there, certainly not on the clifftops where we heard it anyway.  The creepy part was that while David, Sarah and I all heard it from a close distance, Luke heard the exact same noise right by his ear.  

We ended up camping out there to see if anything would happen, and were sleeping with no bags or tents, just some blankets under the stars and a little fire, so I felt safe when we all laid down.  I fell asleep pretty quickly, but woke up a few hours later to see everyone else laying with their eyes open wide, listening.  The canyon was completely full of noises.  The only way to describe it is people banging rocks together.  There would be one ""set"" maybe 300 yards away, then another clacking 200 yards away, so it was hard to tell exactly how many ""rock smacking rock"" noises there were

And everything immediately stopped.  My heart was in my throat.  We just sat there and stared at each other, but it sounded kind of like a zebra noise.  Like these squeaky trills.  It got louder, and then the rocks/sticks/whatever started up again.  But this was worse, because now OTHER animal noises came.  We heard what sounded like wolves or coyotes barking, monkeys screeching (in my opinion, those were the most terrifying) owls hooting, and through it all that terrible zebra noises.  [Here are some real zebra noises if you want to hear.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQcx8C8Aj_g)  We said nope, pack our blankets

That night I was ...obviously... pretty shaken up.  Before I could fall asleep again, to avoid a lecture about fucking with the spirits.)  She asked me about it, and I ended up spilling my guts about not seeing the canyon ruins.  It was something personal, it felt like.  I wanted to go there, why couldn't I go there? It would have been beautiful.  After I word-vomited all over her, I could see that she had a really concerned look on her face.  ""What is it?"" I asked, totally confused, the spirits push them off.  That's why we don't go there."" 

I remained creeped out for the remainder of the visit.  The town has a public-accessible kiva, as of course my superstitious family refused to ""enter other natives' dwellings.""  I figured that nothing could push me off a cliff if I was in a kiva.

I was right, but I of course didn't believe it.  

I don't smoke, and stand there, for the rest of my 10 minute break.  

Most of the smokers were already filing back in, mentally patting myself on the back for not being a pussy.  Then I saw something that I will never ever be able to give a rational or even halfway accountable explanation for.  We have like, six parking lots....in one of the lots far away from me, maybe 100 feet, I could see something walking.  It was a dog, obviously, but it was almost limping and walked like it was tired or hurt.  Animal lover me forgot all about skinwalkers and I started walking toward it

The dog had the body form of a greyhound, but it walked more like a person would on feet and hands, its butt was moving to and fro if that makes any sense.  When it heard me, it just stopped without turning (something I've never known any dog to do.)  And finally, it looked over its shoulder at me and this is the freaky part........this dog was looking at me the way a person does.  It had HUGE eyes....way too big for a greyhound, and its teeth were bared like it was considering biting me.  Then it growled, but it was like a whistle/growl.  Noises no regular animal makes.  It almost sounded like it wanted to talk to me or was taunting me.  

Somehow in the middle of all this I realized it didn't have a tail, dont' have tails.  Fucking all logic and rationality, I turned and jetted.  I didn't look back until I was back inside the building and had pulled the doors shut behind me, and by then when I looked of COURSE the fucking thing was gone.  

When I described this to my brothers they were absolutely sure it was a skinwalker, them, and their apartments.  I never saw the creepy bloody dog again, and I have never since even slightly wanted to visit cliff ruins.

This happened my senior year of college

so the first two nights went down with no incident, but decide to lock the dog inside in case of a coyote or something. After awhile we start to get a little creeped out. I keep saying it's probably an animal and we'll be fine. My gf (not too bright) wants to go investigate to see what's outside, so I lock the door behind her (hehe, just kidding).  She goes outside and says she saw something small and grey (probably a coyote) and it ran off. So, just an animal, no worries. but by this time, we're pretty spooked.

The dog now starts barking at the window on the other side of the house, eerie lullaby. I don't say anything, hoping that my mind is playing tricks on me.  My gf says, ""Let's get the fuck outta here."" I say ""Why?"" she says, ""You didn't hear that little girl singing?"" ""Ok, let's get the fuck out."" and we got the fuck out. I even called someone to talk to me while we walked out to my car. Next morning, went to clean up the house and such.

Most scared i've ever been. Ever.

For years I've been able to contact the dead. Please believe me when I say this is not a story, instead of /nosleep. Because I desperately want to meet people like me, who can see and communicate with the dead.

I can't talk to anybody about this. My mom knows of my ability, but one day in the car, I quietly asked her if my grandfather's last words to her were something along the lines of ""You never say goodbye. Always 'see you later'."" Naturally my mother flipped shit, threw the car into park in the middle of a traffic jam, and stared at me in complete disbelief. She frequently makes jokes that I should have a T.V. show. Like this ""long island medium"" or whatever. Nobody can know about this ability, hence the throwaway. Whenever I try to prove it, people are skeptics and refuse to listen to me.

No, and ask them to be open with me. It's hard, because they all have their own quirks, like humans, and know how to fuck with people. I don't even hear them using my ears, unless they want me to. But when I sit down, by myself (or with someone that can do what I can do) in an area that's known to be haunted, only sometimes, but they're giving off currents of emotion that hint towards how old they are

It got pretty scary. Until this happened

I was able to tell her his name, how he died, where he died, what his babysitter looked like, acted like, how she talked, what her name was, my head was down in my hands, and communicate pretty heavily that they want to be left alone. Her little brother is crazy about getting his foot in the door. He loves to talk and communicate.

So, you first need to be comfortable, your mind to be clear, and your head to be in the game. It's so hard sometimes when ghosts are around, and they want to talk, but I don't want to. It's like tapping on the cage of a zoo animal. All it's doing is rattling their chains. If you want to interact with a zoo animal, wait until it gets close to you. Otherwise

Sometimes I think he doesn't like me. Like now. I can't see him, and I'm not sure why.

Well, just better. She'll know what to do. 

This is a throwaway but if any of you have experienced this type of ability, and I want to talk to you.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,

Me and the dog bandit are having a pretty good time when I noticed that the others have stopped what they are doing and I hear my Jake call out my name, it was maybe about the size of a basketball and was flashing from red, blue, orange, and yellow.  When we finally get in side Jake and Steve have just finished locking all the doors and windows and Jake grabs a shotgun my dad had left and we head up stairs.  As we are up there we can see the glow from this floating orb and all its colors when suddenly there is a bright burst of white light and we all relax thinking it's over.  Boy were we wrong.

About 30 to 45 seconds after the white light as were catching are breath we hear it.  The distinct sounds of footsteps in our gravel drive way as someone or something is walking toward the house.  We hear it move closer and closer eventually making its way to the front porch.  It than makes it way to the to the door where we hear a loud bang as if it's testing the door or something knocking on the windows.  Steve gets the idea to look out the window and immediately turns whiter than I thought humanly possible.  He didn't say it at the time but he saw the shadow as we left the front porch light on and said it didn't look right.  As all this going on Bandit has been freaking the fuck out barking non stop and it appears is trying to get out the window.  This has been going on for maybe a minute or two but seems like ages.  Finally we hear are neighbors truck start up and there's another white flash and hear the neighbor tearing ass over to our house.  

When he gets there he pretty much breaks down the door before Jake can get it open and asks if were alright.  He told us that he saw the white flash and looked out the window to investigate and saw the figure approaching the house and rushed to get dressed and had his wife call the deputy who lived down the road and have him get to our house immediately.  He said that as his wife was talking to the deputy she was looking out the window and started screaming that it was trying to get in.  With shotgun in hand Jim jumped in his truck and hauled ass over.  When Andy, one in the field across the street and one behind the house the were round and shape and about three yards across.  You could also clearly see where it had been banging on the wooden the door as it slightly dented the wood a little bit and had smudged are glass windows.  He called the Sherif he came out to have a look as well.  When my mom got home I don't think I've been so happy my to see her my entire life.  I immediately hugged her and held on tight the rest of the night.

The road went straight along the bottom of a wide, onto the ridge. 

It was about 10pm, I saw something through my side window. White thing. It was rapidly getting larger in my peripheral vision, as though it had been moving parallel to me, but the turn in the road meant I was now in its path. So I turned my head and looked directly.

It was white. Man-shaped but without genitals, completely hairless. It was *crawling*, on its hands and knees, but it was half the size of the car, and it was coming so very, very fast. It had a rubbery face, distorted by hate or a scream, I can't even tell you, it was on the road

And then it was gone. The rearview mirror showed me nothing. I have never told anybody. I have seen a few minor glitchy/ghosty things over my many years

I can't seem to find any reference to anything like it

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies so far. I looked into the skinwalker and wendigo ideas, that's just the look on its face. I heard nothing. 

This happened in Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders have no trouble telling ghost stories, Newfoundland has only black bears, hell I even tried to tell myself it was a badly lost wet polar bear, but when I say the thing was crawling, I mean I could see its legs below the knee. I was very close to it by the end, and it looked like a crawling man.

I spent a lot of time in that area, I never told this story either. The degree of fear involved somehow put it in its own category. As if it would be very, very bad luck to speak of it, because it had seen me too. I never thought I believed in them, but I think it was a demon.",,False,t5_2sntx,True

1361377825.0,18w589,[ME][FAM] My parents' haunted house. Something is there. Stories from the years.,,156,25,39,"I always feel crazy when I say this...but it's true

A little background on my parents home: It's pretty old.  Part of it is a log cabin that was built in 1850 and was used as a schoolhouse somewhere in Indiana.  In the 1910's or early 1920's this log cabin was hauled across state lines to southern Ohio by a wealthy banking family whose name a lot of people would probably recognize.  Anyway, a dining room, some extra bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.  This was in the 1920's, so one of the coolest parts of the house is that there is a speakeasy hidden in the basement.  For those of you who are unaware of what that is, a speakeasy is a room that was used for drinking illegal bootleg liquor back during prohibition.  There are two ways into this room in the basement: 1.) Through an incredibly thick wooden door in the furnace room.  It has a massive lock on it and the only way to open this thing is from the other side.  2.) There is a wooden panel in the log cabin part of the house that opens up as a tiny door with a secret staircase going down to it.  If you didn't know what you were looking for

Years went by, each owner the home had added on to the house and is now roughly double the size it was in the 1920's.  The house is pretty big, but strangely so.  It is incredibly long but only a room or two wide at its largest width which always made for really long trips if you forgot something on the other side of the house.  There is lots of wood, stone, antiques, etc. and sits back in the woods where no one can see it from the road.  It's an incredibly beautiful and unique home...but it has its secrets.  Something is definitely wrong.

We moved into this place when I was 16 years old.  I was getting ready to start my junior year of High School and was a pretty shy kid.  Not a loner by any means, didn't do any drugs or drink, respected my parents blah blah blah.  The day we moved in to this place, I knew something was wrong.  It just started out as that eerie feeling of someone or something watching me...it honestly felt like I was a fish in a bowl and I was being *observed*. Observed by something that I couldn't see and didn't understand...but I knew was there.

Honestly, so there was always that constant noise during the day to keep your senses occupied.  Something was still off, though.  I couldn't shake the feeling that something was around us.  

My aunt moved from the northern Ohio to our area my senior year of HS.  She had taken a job in our area and needed a place to stay while her family worked on selling their house and finding one down here.  I love my aunt dearly so she was a welcome addition to our family.  As I said before, and mine on the far end.  It was nice for privacy and space.  When my aunt moved in, she took the guest room next to mine.  It was nice having someone else on that end of the house...you know, since the creepy and all.  I had always heard footsteps in the house, but since I lived with three other people, I always assumed that it was them.  My aunt moving in taught me otherwise.

It was probably around 3am one morning during the summer when my aunt ran into my room freaking the fuck out. 

""T, big time.

""What! What?! What's wrong?"" I said in a groggy freshly woken haze

""Something is in my room! A picture fell off the wall and then my door slammed shut!""

""It was probably just the wind blowing through your window or a draft or something

""...okay...you're probably right.  Good night."" She replied.

The next morning when I asked her what the hell that was about

A few months go by and I find out that my aunt has started to barricade her door shut at night with pillows or a small stool.  I thought that was weird

""Oh

That freaked me out a little bit, but a few times I had been woken up by a thud.  I always thought it was her going to the bathroom and closing the door a little too loudly.  Turns out it wasn't.

My parents, but she says a bottle or two of Merlot will make everything okay.  Our trip was fantastic, but when we get home we find one terrified woman.  ""Your house is haunted.  You know that right?""  She says plainly.  ""There was some real weird shit that happened while you were gone.  I was sitting right here *points to a chair outside the kitchen near the TV* and I heard footsteps.  FOOTSTEPS I SAY!""  (again, she is very excitable)

""Are you sure?  Sure it wasn't just some weird noises or something?  Maybe the wind?""  My dad asks.

""The wind

For those of you who are getting bored with this, carefully, and haul them about 200 yards away to a hill near the pond and build a new patio as well as a pergola above it.  Quality father/son bonding time.  It just so happened to be the hottest damned weekend of the year and we were miserable the entire time, but we had fun together - always will remember that.  We were thrilled with our work and how we had changed the house for the better...but something else wasn't.

That night I went to bed exhausted.  I climbed in my bed, as if someone was sitting on it.  I slid my legs to the bottom of the bed and encountered some resistance.  I thought that it was probably just the sheets, you know how they can hang off the end of the bed put some weight on your feet.  Pulled the covers up - still was some pressure there.  I began to think that it was probably just my tired body, so I slid my legs to the right to the other side of the bed.  Nothing.  Felt perfect, just like normal.  Slid them back to the other side and it felt like I was pushing them under something sitting on the bed. I woke up later that night to my father standing in my doorway, light shining behind him.  He was standing there is his underwear with a gun.

""Quick! Get up! Someone is in the house!"" Rambo-Dad said. ""Get your bat.  We have to go look."" My mother and sister run into my room with their two coward dogs. Luckily my aunt was out of town.

I didn't ask any questions.  Just grabbed my bat and followed my old man to battle.  We didn't find anyone in the house.  Turns out that both my mom and dad were woken up in the middle of the night by a door slamming really

I glanced at my alarm clock...what time was it? 3:20AM.  The whole 3am thing really started to fuck with me.  More and more I'd find myself waking up at 3somethingAM - not sure if it was my body doing it because I was worried about that hour

We ended up getting a security system on the house with all of the windows and doors wired.  Dad felt better about that

I went away to college and didn't come home much during that first year.  I really found myself and who I was that year.  I came home during breaks but didn't spend much time in that house for quite a while.  I spoke with my parents frequently

One of the original rooms in the home serves as my parents dining room.  It's a beautiful room with large windows looking out over the property and a 12 foot long antique table with a mirror surface that came with the house.  There is a chandelier in the middle of the room over the table as well as 6 wall sconces that sit on 3 walls.  One wall has a big fireplace and some shelves.  One day, nothing is fixing it.  The electrician gets called out - he's a good family friend, so we trust him.  He does fine work.  He checked out everything and couldn't figure it out.  He told my dad that he needs to come back the next day and work and that he disconnected the electricity to each light source.  Please keep in mind that each of these lights has to be turned on separately - the chandelier is on a light switch, and each wall sconce needs to be turned on at the source.  Electricity is disconnected.  Lights are out.  Night falls and it's time to go to bed.  Apparently my father went downstairs to close up when he sees a light on...well, *lights* on.  Every single light in that dining room was on.  The next day Dad calls up the electrician.  ""Hey electrician...did you disconnect the electricity in the dining room yesterday?"" He asks.  ""Well yeah, why?"" The electrician responds.  ""Because the lights were on last night...""

""(Dad's name)...that's impossible.""

Weird things started happening more frequently in that room and it always seemed to be for a period of a few weeks after they threw a big party or if we had changed something in the house.  I got a dog my sophomore year and we came home for the summer.  The dog was great but she was very playful and really strong.  One day my mother comes up to me and says ""T

""What are you talking about

""You know what I'm talking about."" She said.

A few days go by

Turns out that the chairs in the room were moving around.  There are on wheels and there's a hardwood floor

""I'm sorry I accused you of moving the chairs.  I know it wasn't you."" She said.

""Haha

""The ghosts."" She said very matter-of-fact.  ""It's the ghosts.  But don't worry, came back 2 minutes later and the chairs were moved again.  Apparently she had come to grips with there being ghosts in the house and said the following ""I don't care if you're here.  You are welcome here...but you're scaring me and please stop moving my chairs around"".  Sure as shit, the chairs never moved again.  Lighting problems in that room kept happening, though.

Crazy things kept happening.  From time to time we'll smell pipe smoke in the library.  That's usually a tip off that something crazy is going to happen soon.  None of us smoke, one time we heard a loud slamming sound, ran in, and found 4 books from the bottom bookshelf on the floor.  5 feet away from the book shelf.  These books were on the bottom shelf, inches off the floor...and there is a small lip inside the shelf that is a real pain the butt sometimes...but somehow those books got out.  Somehow. 

Years passed, be in places we didn't leave them, it's just normal to them now.

I graduated college and was about a month away from marrying the love of my life.  We had just moved into a new home together.  It was Christmas Day and we were celebrating at my parents house.  My grandparents, and mom (I know this sounds crazy) asked the ghosts if the lights could work on Christmas because she was having her family over.  It was a Christmas miracle!  The lights were on!  Hooray!  What happened next wasn't so hooray, though.

We're all eating, the weird stories weren't far behind.  Mom tells everyone about the lights in the room...and that's when I got an idea.  I was feeling pretty good, just had moved the stuff out of my room and moved in with my fiancee literally days before, and wasn't super scared of the house any more.  

I challenged them.

""Hah!  If there are any ghosts in this room

Bad idea.  Every single light in that room shut off the instant I finished my sentence. The chandelier

Naturally

I yelled out ""OKAY! YOU WIN! I'M SORRY!""

Power on.  All of the lights came back on.  This time we didn't scream...everyone was too afraid to make a noise.  Dinner ended shortly after.

Got married the next month

My mom calls up one day and tells me that she met a paranormal investigative team and that they are going to bug the house and do one of those paranormal investigative things.  She invited me to be there when they do it

I did, shadow people, terrifying noises that sounded like ""rape and murder and body in the field"" and a whole bunch of other stuff.  If I can get the pics from my mom I'll try to put them up.  One of the people on the team claims to be able to feel energy or whatever, and basically she told us that our house is the most pants-shittingly haunted place she has ever been.

That ""psychic"" lady knows some person who works at A&amp;E on one of those ghost programs...and they called to ask my parents if they could use their home for a show.

Of course

I don't know what's in that house, but it always is creepy.

I know this is long

-DoctorGoop


EDIT:  Forgot to include this.  My mom claims that there is a spirit of some sort that is haunting *her*.  It's really hard to explain, so who knows.  I hope it's just bad luck.  Oh yeah, the shadow people pictures are always in her room.  So that sucks.

EDIT: HOW AM I FORGETTING THIS STUFF?!

Anyway, open', which means something opened.  It's the middle of winter, Dad's out of town, she's freaking out and in her car calling me.  I drive over with my wife and my sister, who was over hanging out with my wife.  We live about 15-20 minutes away so it wasn't a big deal.

I get out of the car, and I get to the library...suddenly... pipe smoke.  **Heavy air**.  *Oh shit*. I keep going through the library into the log cabin and I get the most distinctive feel that something is there and is NOT happy about my being in their home.  All of my hairs stand on end, and there is a very strong feeling of anger in the room.  All of a sudden I hear my wife over the phone freaking out.  ""DoctorGoop! DoctorGoop! ARE YOU OKAY WHERE ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU?""  ""Shut up!"" I said to my wife with love. ""You're going to give me away""!

I get through the rest of the house.  No one is there...living

As I walk out the front door

When we told my dad about it

I got the little book the alarm company gives you that explains which zones are which...Zone 48...the one my mom heard open...was a window in the library

Not sure how I forgot about that....kind of wish I had forgotten for good.

1356984926.0,15qm9o,[ME+FAM] My childhood experiences in a haunted Victorian home.,Kidthink,160,26,53,"I've had several people request this

My parents, and was often used as 3 separate living spaces (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs), so it has had its fair share of tenants. A few months after arriving, the old man who lived across the street told us a scary story. His family has lived in that house for generations (there’s 3 generations living there now – it’s a little weird). He said that when he was a kid, the upstairs tenant in the front bedroom at my parents’ house killed herself. She was a single woman who never had visitors, so no one found her body until her rent was late. Sure enough, we found a body-shaped warped spot on the floor. He also told us that an old woman died in the kitchen

In 1998, and he had grown up in the neighborhood. He said he knew the girl who killed herself upstairs. One of the girls at the party had a mother battling cancer. She asked Johnny if her mother was going to die soon. “YES.” “How soon?” “T-W-O-D-A-Y-S.” The girl started crying, assuming someone in the room was moving the cursor and being mean. So she told Johnny to prove he was real, and all the candles in the room were blown out. Needless to say, the séance ended immediately. Two days later, the girl’s mom died.

After the birthday party, and other disturbing things as well. One night, as she was trying to fall asleep, there was a loud scraping noise from inside the closet. [Now, the closet has a removable panel in the top that opens into the attic. There’s a fully functional attic ladder in the hallway, so there is no real reason for this panel to be there. The only reason we have come up with is that the closet, along with the antique murphy beds next to it, “…We’re watching you.” As she ran downstairs screaming

Johnny, only to be greeted with loud slamming noises. On one occasion, the old rotary phone sitting on the arm of the couch (in the front room the past tenant died in) was hurled across the room at her head; she ducked and it hit the wall behind her. It didn’t fall naturally, because it would have had to go up from the arm of the couch to hit her head. There was also an old mirror in my sister’s bedroom that had been there when we moved in.  We would find it lying on the floor after being hung up repeatedly. My mom saw it come off the wall, slide to the floor, fall on its face, and slide across the room.

When these things started happening, with whom I shared my blanket and pillow, would wake me by hissing and growling at things I couldn’t see. He would get to the point that he would stand over me, hissing, arching his back and swiping at air. My bedroom door would also creak open by itself, and I often saw black shapes in the hallway.

After awhile, many times that I became utterly convinced someone was breaking into the house. Doors would slam, specific stairs would creak, and more importantly, I heard men in hard-soled shoes walking around and talking upstairs. The talking was loud, but also muffled and unintelligible. It always sounded like two men in the front bedroom. I would shove myself under the couch for hours, or hide in the closet, my brother swears he doesn’t remember any of this happening, “No

On another occasion, cast iron beast. L takes off running and laughing, chasing H around the basement for several minutes, thinking they were playing. She eventually stopped when she realized H wasn’t even home.

Another time, but that is something I would never have done.

One day, my brother checked the caller ID. We had missed over 200 calls in the short time we were gone – and they were all from famous names like Adolf Hitler, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, etc. We grabbed a disposable camera and tried to take pictures of the caller ID, but none of them came out. This could’ve been someone hacking our phone somehow I’m sure, but it was weird nonetheless.

Things went on this way for months. If I had to guess, so they won’t really confirm my timeline. My mom, at her wit’s end, called up a friend and confessed the haunting to her over the phone. The friend said she had experience with this sort of thing, and they prayed together over the phone. I remember specifically that the friend prayed for “a hedge of protection around the house.” After that phone call, things seemed to calm down a bit. I still heard voices and saw shapes, but doors slammed less often and it seemed the rest of my family didn’t experience anything. I remained terrified of the attic and the basement


I have read a lot on the subject since then, 12, 14 and 18 when things really took off, and my parents were furiously remodeling the home. Every time we tore out the lathe and plaster in the walls, we found more items. In my dad’s office, we found a bloodstained nightgown and work gloves shoved inside the wall. In the front bedroom upstairs, we found a brittle old whip, and a weird

The strange happenings remained on such a level that they could be ignored, drumming on the desk, and I twirled in the computer chair. As I twirled, I saw a man standing in the doorway to the kitchen on the left side. He was wearing a dark hat – **EDIT:** [just found out it's called a ""Low Topper Hat""](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_704/1343910323lq2C5c.jpg), and either he was wearing dark clothing, or his body was just black. He was Caucasian, but his skin looked tan and leathery. He had salt &amp; pepper mutton chops. He made eye contact with me, and ran across the living room as my chair spun. He ran through the wall and into the hallway closet. It took a few seconds for me to come to grips with what I had seen

The entire time I lived in that house, my cat hissing, things falling off shelves when they should’ve been secure, muffled voices. I continuously had nightmares, and one night terror. During the night terror, I saw what looked a lot like Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York crawling up my bed towards me (it could’ve been the man from the living room, I suppose). I felt my bed shake and felt his hands on my legs. His eyes reflected light from the bedroom window. I kept my eyes shut until his grip went away. At one point

On one occasion

On another occasion

My sister L and I had another experience in 2002. She wanted to see the abandoned old folks’ home my friends and I hung out at a lot, she slept in my bed that night and I slept in my walk-in closet that I had cleared out; I left the door to the closet open and slept in a sleeping bag. During the night, I woke up terrified. In the top corner of my closet, there was a massive black shape – just the deepest, darkest black – it had density. It had no real shape, and no face, but I could feel it staring at me. I also had the feeling that if I tried to get up and run, and after a very long time

While I slept, panicked, and made a run for the bedroom door. As I ran, all of the cabinets in the attached kitchenette swung open violently. When I opened the door to run out, I ran directly into a man’s chest. He was wearing a black, woolen, double-breasted suit jacket with gold buttons. I also remember the color baby blue, and he had no face. I pushed back from him and started to scream as my sister woke me up. She said, haha) when she heard someone tapping along to the music on the bannister above her. She looked up and saw a man watching her – he ducked back as soon as she looked up. She ran upstairs to see if our brother was playing tricks on her

She moved out shortly after seeing the man. I remained in the house until 2009, most of our phenomenon happened in the middle of the day, not during the night. My parents still don’t like to talk about it, although they will admit that this all happened after a couple of glasses of wine. My brother still lives at home. He has sworn off my parents’ religion, and has even gone out of his way to try to “summon” various things in his bedroom (the room the previous tenant died in). Nothing ever came of his attempts, to his knowledge. I’d rather not go into many details about my brother, because it’s private and it would be very easy for him to find this post. Suffice to say, and I believe the house is still active. I will mention that I went to check on him one night after hearing slamming sounds for more than 30 minutes. He answered his bedroom door with his face red and his forehead scratched up

Little things still happen anytime I visit home, because my parents and brother are not the kind of people to want to talk about it.

I’m sure there are other little events that I am missing. If they come to mind

I’d also like to mention that I have spent hours and hours trying to find out more about the history of my parents’ house, and I have all the information I need to get a copy of the Historic Deed. If I manage to find anything interesting soon, OP will deliver. Thank you if you read this whole thing, and feel free to ask anything you want, as I’m sure my writing isn’t the best.

**EDIT:** Not really necessary information... but after re-reading my post


**EDIT:** I just returned from my visit home. After 3 days spent in the Recorder of Deeds office at the courthouse and various genealogical libraries, I have the names of all of the owners of the house from 1891-2012. So I'm now taking all of that information onto ancestry.com and finding the house owners in other people's family trees, in hopes of getting more information about their deaths, and possibly even photos. I'll update soon if I get more info!



**EDIT 2-21-13:** I have been too busy to continue my research

I did find out something I found awesome. The house used to face 90 degrees counter-clockwise, complete with the sidewalk and steps running up to it. The front door used to be in the EXACT spot that I saw the man run through the wall in the living room. So to him, he saw me and panicked, and ran out *the front door*, not through a wall. It gives me a better idea of when he would have lived there, but I haven't been able to progress further yet because of life getting in the way. I hope to have more info soon.

OH! And I also found out that the same family lived there from the 1890s until the 1940s

Whether or not this was the case

One of my fascinations (though as a sceptic I take everything with a grain of salt) is the unexplainable

r/nosleep began to lose it's shine for me when I started reading too many stories that were obvious fiction. I understand the place of fiction

So my point is... migration from r/nosleep means the likelihood of stories being actual accounts of experiences diminishes due to the prevailing culture of the scare

This is all just a thought

But I feel it's important to have a space to share actual accounts of the unexplainable

Have at thee!

1369914409.0,1fbxc7,[ME] Odd Story From My Stay in a Small Town (x-post from /r/AskReddit),Vanimity,148,22,16,"Hi

Story:

In 2007 I finished college and was offered a posting as an admin in a small town working with local law enforcement. It was a 6-month contract and paid really well so all within a week I accepted the job

The town had just over 15

I worked with the same officers all the time on rotating shifts and three weeks into my stay I was into the afternoon shifts which meant I was getting home around 2am. As I came down the hallway of the building I saw a light coming from under my neighbour's door and saw the shadow of feet under the door and the peephole went dark as if they heard me and were looking to see who was in the hall. I figured if they wanted to say hello they would have opened the door so I simply waved hello and went into my apartment. Over the next couple of weeks this happened 3-4 times again. I was pretty sure I had a reclusive but nosy neighbour.

Then one night after work I crawled into bed at 3am and could hear that my neighbour was moving around in the room of theirs that adjoined my bedroom. About ten minutes later the noises got louder and it started to get me worried. They had never been this loud and it almost sounded as if they were being attacked or having a heart attack and knocking things over. I ran out of the apartment and started knocking loudly on their door but they didn't answer. I called out to them saying I was worried about them and if they didn't answer I would call for help. Still no answer. I ran back into my apartment and could hear bangs through the wall so I called the police station and asked my co-worker to send an officer over. I went and knocked on my neighbour's door one more time but no answer and then headed down to the lobby to wait for the officer who showed up within 5 minutes. I had gotten to know him a bit and we went up and knocked on the door but still no answer. I took him into my apartment and we could still hear loud thumps every 5-10 seconds and then a huge bang. The officer asked if I could go get the building manager to open the door. She lived one block away so I said I'd run over and get her. Luckily she was a night owl and watching TV. I told her that my neighbour was being really loud and wouldn't answer the door so she grabbed the keys and we headed over. The officer was waiting for us in the lobby and she asked which apartment it was and I told her 304. She looked at me weirdly and said 304 was empty. I said I had heard my ""neighbour"" making noise nearly every day and had seen the light on and shadows under the door a few times. The officer said he heard the noises too and asked if 304 was the apartment that was above the carport and she said yes. He replied that someone could easily climb up onto the carport and perhaps there were squatters in the empty apartment. We went up and the manager unlocked the door and the officer opened it. The apartment was dark and he turned the light on. He went in and the manager and I were peaking in through the doorway. He went into the bedroom and came back out and said it was empty. We went in and the place was spotless. All but two of the windows were locked and no sign of squatters. We all just stood there scratching our heads. The officer looked at me and said ""You're not crazy

Fast forward almost six weeks and I was again on afternoon shifts. I came home at 2am and there was a light on. I quickly went into my bedroom and could hear thumping from next door. I called the station and asked for an officer to come out and then called my building manager. I slipped down to the lobby and waited for them. A different officer showed up and I knew him too. My building manager arrived and all three of us headed upstairs. The light was off and the building manager unlocked the door. The officer went in and everything checked out. We checked the windows again and they were still all locked. I apologized and tried to rationalize it that I had just come off of four days of 14-hour shifts and was tired

Two weeks later the apartment was rented out and I got a chance to greet my new neighbours. I told them to keep an eye out because we were sure squatters had been coming in and out and I relayed the stories to them.

My final week there, lamp and side table had been knocked over and there was blood everywhere. Unfortunately, they passed away before getting to the hospital. I just stared at him and he reminded me he had heard the banging too the night I called him over.

I asked the building manager about it the day I moved out and asked why she hadn't told me. She laughed and said ""Oh honey

1362530305.0,19qreg,[ME] My camping trip.,jbark97,149,23,22,"So a while ago, and two counselors (who were only 5 or 6 years older than us kids). It was in the Pacific Northwest (of the USA). Washington, after the hike was over

Fast forward to dinner time that night. As we are all munching on our food, we have to go in groups to go to the bathroom. I volunteer to go, as does another guy. The bathroom is approximately 200 yards away from our campground, so it's a bit of a walk. The sun is near done setting as we arrive at the bathroom. The girl goes in and does her business. As the other guy and I are waiting for her, we decide that it's probably smarter to go to the bathroom now, rather than going in the middle of the night. So we're in there, and I, am washing my hands. The other camper is in the stall. There are two sinks. All of a sudden, weird shit like that happens all the time. No biggie. So, and as we're about to walk back (it's pretty dark now) she says

For all the people who are reading this and saying

We slept in four tents (there were four girls and five guys, all within 10 meters, I would say. So we are all trying to fall asleep (the previous ""flashlight encounter"" had completely slipped my mind by now). We are talking, as kids do, when suddenly... footsteps. The same speed as the ones before that we had heard. My tentmates start making some noise (like, ""what the fuck was that"", etc...), just listening. After a while they go away. It was weird, and start to doze off, I shit you not

The next morning. I wake up thinking it was just a nightmare, I have no idea what the fuck any of that was: the siren, the woman, the faucet. Nothing. hearing my roommates walk around our house as I'm trying to fall asleep at night still scares the fuck out of me.

1336650334.0,tgc0x,Driving to work,angelinblack,144,22,44,"From my NoSleep post. Found you guys and thought you might like another true story to add to the collection.

On my way to work tonight (12am to 8am) I noticed something a little strange on the side of the road that I don't normally see on this trip.

I have to use the backroads to get to the interstate so that I can get from where I live in the sticks to the city where I work. Its not a very long trip but is pretty boring considering there isnt much scenery other than the rows of woods on the side of the road the whole way. But I make this trip on a regular basis and it is usually uneventful.

Now maybe this happend because I have been browsing reddit for a while and have gotten integrated into the community of people who seem to see scary stuff on a regular basis. But I know that I never had a need to get an account and post anything until what happend tonight. 

As I said it was a normal drive to work until my headlights hit something that looked a little out of the ordinary. Now I wasn't worried at first because it is normal to see stray dogs walking around on the roads. But this one was different

Now the body was about the size of a mid-sized dog but the legs were more like four arms that were longer than any legs on a dog that I have ever seen. And the way it was swinging them forward to where they came parrallel to the ground was the weirdest part. But I soon didn't have time to really analyze because it had notice that I had taken interest and it had done the same to me. It started swinging its arms at full sprint towards the car. I never accelerated so fast in my life. But as I said before these were backroads and hence there are no streetlights. So I had no idea where this thing was once my headlights were past it. I was going so fast that I had to slow down to make a turn that was coming up. I didn't know where it was until the low glow of red from my tailights lit this thing up that was now chasing my car down the road. Needless to say I didn't slow down again until I got to the interstate. 

I guess it didn't like being around other cars because I did not see it at all for the rest of the trip. But I definitely want to find out what exactly this thing was doing when I came up to it on the side of the road. It will be daylight when I drive home so hopefully it doesn't like the sun.

My wife and I were living at my Grandma’s house *it’s a very large house* and we had the entire upstairs. My wife and I were in the master bedroom and our 3 month old daughter was in a front bedroom across the hall from us. We had one of those new fancy baby monitors that has the breathing sensor and all that. Primarily

One night while trying to go to sleep

As I lay there trying to nod off, and that came through clear. So I figured it was just some interference with the monitor. However, a few moments later I heard clear as day over the monitor an older woman’s voice saying ”SHhhh, it’s ok.” In a very soft and almost comforting tone. However, being a new father living where we did I freaked out. 

Leaping out of bed thinking that someone is in my daughter’s room about to kidnap her or something, or crying it would turn on and move and play soft music. That was on *in the middle of its song*, my daughter appeared sound asleep and no one was in the room.

Figuring I must have dreamt the voice, before we put her to bed she was fine, only 3 hours had passed since then which probably means her temperature would have continued rising throughout the night had something not made me go in there.

My wife and I can only conclude to this day that the ghost of the old woman that we are pretty sure is in my Gma’s house was the one who got me in there. My grandma’s house is over 110 years old and holds a lot of history. So, and are quite certain that whatever it was, it saved our child’s life.

These events take place in my parents' home (in which I currently reside as I prepare for my next phase of life). We don't live in a historic or very old home or anything like that. The house is part of a plan of homes that was built post-World War II so that the gentlemen coming home would have somewhere to set up shop and start a family in cushy suburbia. Nevertheless

At the time of this incident I was 11 years old, and being as we had the upcoming Easter weekend off from school, Thursday was the day we both had our class Easter parties. Maggie came home with a large, bright yellow smiley face balloon.

My dad tied it to one of her bedposts for her since she wanted to keep it as long as the helium would allow. Immediately things with that balloon were strange. Maggie and I were home before our parents (latch-key kids!) in those days and she sprinted up to her room to play with the balloon (initially

""Ehhhhh

I went upstairs to her room and the balloon had indeed come undone and was huddling in the highest corner of her ceiling. No biggie. I grabbed a chair to stand on and got it for her. Later when we were about to go to bed

""Make it really tight

The next day when we came home from school - you guessed it - our friend was loose again. ""Daddy didn't do a good job

Over the next day or so the helium was starting to go, figuring Maggie had left it in the hall and it had drifted my way in its sluggish state. I returned it to her room and went to start my day.

Over the next few days everyone in my family was beginning to notice this balloon and its strange ways. Maggie was fussy because it was never where she left it and Mom and Dad were sharing a some laughs over a few small scares they had when it appeared in a doorway. No one was feeling threatened and Maggie still liked the thing

That is, the first four days we had it, it stayed upstairs. On the fifth day, the four of us were in the downstairs living room when the balloon slowly floated across the room we were in and into the next. We had a moment of shared silence and then burst out laughing. We were all severely creeped out, but it was broad daylight and we were all together. However, I did notice that my dad mentioned it being time to get rid of it.

The next day when Maggie and I came home from school, but Maggie seemed amused and ran upstairs to change. It was then that the balloon ""walked"" by me and slowly floated upstairs after her. I have no idea how, but I distinctly recall the stairs creaking as it moved. I was stunned. Maggie was delighted.

That night I explained what had happened to my Dad and asked if he could please get rid of it (if I did it, but she turned on the waterworks about it being her favorite and saying she would keep a better eye on it.

As we arrived home from school the next day

Except it wasn't.

Maggie was distraught

""Dad?"" we called. No reply.

After a minute the balloon rounded the corner from the stairs into my bedroom doorway and stopped dead. At that very moment, but my Dad found us holed up in my room and the balloon innocently swaying in Maggie's. He popped that sucker right quick.

Now, but to this day Maggie and I go over it (especially when we're drunk) and can't satisfy our minds.

1362181836.0,19hshi,Woman mysteriously falls down elevator shaft she heard voices in and dies. X-post from no sleep.,rosaliezom,119,27,25,"I wasn't sure if this was the place to post this. It is completely true.


I haven't thought about this in months. Half a year ago I moved to San Antonio to stay with my family for awhile. My dad is a mechanic and my step mom is the house keeping manager at The Crockett Hotel. She was able to get me a job as a front desk agent.


After a few weeks of me working there, but it did peak my interest. I knew my step mom obviously had to know her and know more about what happened so I decided to talk to her about it.


She didn't really give me a lot of detail. Basically that Gloria (the housekeeper) had mistakenly walked into an open elevator shaft where the elevator should have been. She fell six stories to her death. My step mom didn't really seem like she was comfortable discussing it but I knew I had to find out more information. I asked my dad if he knew anything about it and he told me Gloria and my step mom were good friends


At this point I was beginning to become morbidly curious. I wanted to know the gruesome details. I started asking my coworkers what they knew about Gloria and the ghosts. No one really knew much of anything about that. Awhile passed and I didn't really think about it. I remember one morning I was sitting in the little employee dining area we had in the basement just before work


""You should be scared


""I don't like talking about it, staring me right in the face. ""But everyone knows we're haunted now. She told us that's where the voices come from, in there."" She was no longer smiling, and was visibly shaken. Up until this point I really had no idea and hadn't even thought about where it had happened. The idea of the elevator being somewhere I walked by everyday scared me a lot. It was like a horrible presence, watching and listening. You could easily underestimate how scary an inanimate object such as the closed doors of an elevator can be but I'll never forget the sense of dread I felt when I looked at it.


""No one will use that elevator anymore


This was very shocking to me. It was the first time I really felt scared to be in the hotel at all. From that point on I avoided the basement as much as possible. I actually found a written statement the front desk manager had made for the lawyers of what had happened that day. I actually made a photocopy of it and read it over when I got home.
If I remember correctly, broken body until the authorities arrived.


That was basically the end of his statement. I remember the most disturbing part was during the time I was trying to find more information on what happened, Mrs. Rodriguez entered the opening and fell down the hoistway to her death.""


I still don't understand how it happened. How someone could be waiting for an elevator and just walk into an empty elevator shaft even as the doors closed. Maybe Gloria had a good reason to be afraid of that elevator.

-----------------------------------------------------


This is all completely true. Just google ""death at The Crockett Hotel""
I'm not sure how to prove that I actually worked there. The general manager's name is Bill Brendal, the sister hotel is The Meneger and in it is where all employees from the Crockett and The Menger have lunch. The employee lunch room is named ""The Lunch Box"" uhhhmmm... lol Idk what else to say.

I am not sure if this would necessarily make any of you readers ""not sleep

Several years ago (around 1995 or so), I used to often drive out to Austin to hang out with Rick, shoot pool, drink beer, you know: things buddies do whilst in college.

So, Victorian-types, with lots of bedrooms, etc., which is perfect for college-age guys to rent. I was planning on driving up on Friday after my classes were over, so I call Rick on the Thursday before to check in and make sure it was still cool for me to drive out. He tells me that ""yeah...come on out,"" but I hear some kind of hesitation in his voice. I ask him what is wrong, ""oh...nothing....don't worry about it. C'mon out and we'll hang out.""

Friday comes, about four bedrooms, and a fun place to hang out. Large backyard. I notice he is acting kind of weird and I keep pressing him to tell me what is going on, but he continues to assure me that nothing is wrong.

Weekend goes by - pool, you know...college stuff.

Sunday afternoon comes and I'm about to leave to drive back to Houston. I say, ""alright. Yeah, something is wrong. One of my roommates was clearing the flowerbed in the backyard early last week and he found something.""

""Found something?"" I say.

He says

He leads me around the side of the house (we had been standing on the front porch) into the backyard. The backyard was large

I say

Rick says

He leads me through the yard over to the flowerbed. He moves the banana fronds out of the way and there in the dirt, ""it gets worse.""

He picks up the shovel laying nearby and uses the handle of it to open the lid of the coffin. The first thing I hear is music box music. It seemed as if opening the lid triggered a music box to begin playing. I don't know where the music box was

It gets worse.

The coffin was lined with red velvet. Inside the lid of the coffin were a number of pictures of people I did not know. The pictures were not old (they were in color and looked to be no more than 5-6 years old...also the clothing the people were wearing in the pictures was relatively consistent for early 90s fashion). I notice that the people's EYES had been scratched out as if with a small pen knife or something

Laying inside of the coffin was the worst part: there was a cat. A dead cat dressed in doll clothes and it appeared to be very dessicated or mummified or something. But wait...it gets weirder. All of the cat's paws had been removed and replaced with heavy gauge brass wire that had been shaped into the shape of claws. These brass claws were jammed into the leg stumps where the cat's original paws had been amputated.

I stood there dumbfounded and Rick says, covered it all back up with the banana fronds and we went back to the front of the house. I drove back to Houston and he moved out of that house within a couple of weeks.

1370971419.0,1g4t85,[ME] A Terrifying and Horribly Sad True Story,OblivionsMemories,120,30,35,"I posted this on /r/NoSleep about 7 months ago

I formatted this as a story when I first typed it up for /r/NoSleep in an effort to try to follow the rules, as it has now been edited twice. It would just be too painful to type it out from scratch again, honestly that's why I've waited so long to repost this... this story isn't easy for me to tell.

So here goes. I was staying at a friend's apartment for the night

No cable, and a broken cd player in the corner. I plopped on the couch, pulled out my crappy nokia, and opened a new game of snake. The cat heard the beeping and came out of hiding to investigate. Her claws pricked my skin for a second as she jumped onto my chest, leaving small stinging welts... and dammit... my allergies. My nose began to tingle when everything changed.

Surprised, but different. Instead of the lumpy leather sofa, I was suddenly on a loveseat, a green and yellow plaid. I looked into the kitchen... there was a woman standing there. She watched me, tears in her eyes. She looked to be straight out of a commercial from the early 60's. I almost expected her to ask if I'd like any Ovaltine.
My brain over ridden with shock
Desperation took hold of her voice.

""It wasn't my fault. You have to believe me!""
I stuttered. ""I... I"".

And then we were in the bathroom. This was all so ludicrous that I barely had time to think how the hell I'd gotten there. Honestly I don't think it even occured to me at the time to wonder. It, newer... and she was kneeling, her back turned to me, singing and laughing over the tub. She was doing something... I stepped forward, and saw. There was a toddler in the tub, a round, pleasant little boy, smiling into his mother's face. He had her eyes

Then the phone rang.

She stood and tweaked his nose
I watched that smiling
I screamed in panic and raced forward... and my hands went right through his little body. I flailed desperately to try to save him. I was soaking wet, I looked up. She stood in the door, watching again.

""It wasn't my fault. Now you see. It wasn't my fault.""

Then the cat was digging its claws into my chest, my friend's old leather couch, in the living room again. My phone was on the ground, the game over screen displayed. Disoriented and crying, I pried the cat's claws from my skin.

...and that's when I noticed. I'm still soaking wet. I sat on the couch in shock for a brief moment, I grabbed my phone and purse and ran out of that apartment faster than I had ever run. I immediately called my friend and he came and got me, I sat with him at the pizza place he was working at until his shift was over. On one of the lulls in customers I finally calmed down enough to tell him everything.

He instantly believed me, which I'll get to in a moment. A few of my friends, however, were skeptical, so we went to the landlord asking for details. He pulled out an article that referenced a murder/suicide in 1963, where the husband killed his wife after she let their unattended toddler drown in the tub.

**TL;DR: In the most emotionally scarring moment of my life

Other things happened in that house all the time, as I refused to go into their bedroom because of how awful it felt in there. The day I helped them move in I walked into their closet with a box, instantly did a big NOPE and booked the hell out.

What I remember is:

Heavy objects would throw themselves across the room at someone.
Once, battery-less stereo in the corner turned itself on to Hells Bells, while the Ozzy cd was sitting on top of the stereo. We freaked out and beat the shit out of it, it stopped after a second.

Let me start by saying I just found this subreddit and frankly, but I'm sincere. That said, here goes.
I know all the classic stories are of old houses in rural areas

Regardless, and honestly I took the very lightest hit of all the weird stuff my sister and I put up with. One thing that really struck me is that one time I was upstairs, and walked into my sister's room across the hall from mine. The way it was set up was that you walked up the stairs from the front 'formal' living room and dining room and found a bathroom straight ahead, my parents' and sister's room on the left, and my room on the right. So in this scenario, I walked by the open bathroom door on my right into my sister's room. When I walked back 30 seconds later to my own room, the sink faucet was on. Neither of us could make head or tails of it. And I know - you're thinking, every horror movie ever. But it wasn't a horror movie

I have never before and never since lived in a house that made more noise. Literally every night, but it was only accessible via a tiny square opening in the ceiling of my parents' walk-in closet, which required a ladder to climb up to. The sounds had no pattern, for the most part. I would count the seconds between clicks and thumps - always different. They would start at random times and disappear in the morning. One time it was the approximate sound of someone running loudly upstairs. Again, it made no sense. I slept in multiple friends' houses in the same neighborhood and never heard those sounds - noises you would expect in a haunted 100-year-old house.

I used to see things out of the corner of my eye - one time I swear to a God I don't really believe in I saw a boy in the kitchen doorway...it was New Years Eve and I was alone - needless to say I drove across town to my parents. Frames and clocks would slam face-down while I was home alone and even while one friend I confided in was over after school once. She was stunned and believes everything I've told her since.

As for my parents, semi-asleep. He walked into my room and asked me, ""Are you alright?"" I looked up, said, ""Yeah, tired, but ok."" It was a stressful time for me and he seemed concerned, and I said no, walked to my sisters room and asked her as well, and asked me if I was sure once more before finally going back downstairs to his TV. I hadn't heard a single thing with my door wide open...and he believed us after that.

Also, right next to the open door, and distinctly saw a tail of blue fabric go around the corner of the upstairs hallway towards our office, to the left of my doorway. That's where my mom ironed, so I figured she must have just forgotten to iron the night before and thought nothing of it - until the garage door downstairs jangled open and I heard her walk into the kitchen literally five seconds later. I walked down the hall and saw no one and nothing unusual, and nothing blue. My sister saw the blue (we think it was a dress) around a corner once too.

Honestly though, I'll get to the real meat on the bone, just ask. But if not, let this fade away into the depths of reddit and tell yourself I'm making this up.

I'm not. And that's why you all should be scared.

Edit: My sister's experience! http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/10b4fw/fam_our_legitimately_haunted_house_cont/

Edit 2: I forgot to mention the weirdest thing I personally saw happen (sort of, my closet was right behind my desk, as it was a small room, and I had this rickety antique-looking roll-y desk chair. I had draped a long necklace over one of the dowels/posts(?) coming out of the top of the chair back, a necklace made of bronze beads that kind of look like pearls but are brown - its a really solid, heavy necklace. 

While following my cat's gaze, no drafts or anything and the beads were heavy enough that to act that way it would indisputably have required a force pulling on it from one side, like a little kid messing around or something. Me and the cat just ogled it for a few more minutes as it swung to a halt again, but there was absolutely no denial nor explanation to justify that seemingly simple, plain as day motion that defied every aspect of whatever reality or natural laws we have in this world. It's funny how something so simple completely blows your logic of the world away - even as an atheist I can't deny anything supernatural or who knows what after literally witnessing defiance of the laws of physics or reality in front of my face.

I never have until I moved out to New Mexico. New Mexico is a darkly beautiful place; it has an emptiness and fullness that somehow coexist.
Now to my story. I started dating a Navajo boy from a pretty traditional Navajo family a few years ago. (I am white, it is a giant, beautiful, and at most times, empty space. You can drive for miles and often see nothing.

His family lived in a trailer attached to a traditional hoghan. I basically ended up moving in with his family for a while, I eventually loved the quietness and peacefulness that I never had experienced growing up in bigger towns.

Again, and please know that I did not believe in any of this stuff. I went along with it because it was an interesting experience and I was respectful of his family's views.

The medicine man said that my boyfriend was following a dark path. He had recently started drinking

Now, I am normally a very logical, rational person, but up until this day, I cannot explain this event. When I tell people that don't come from this area, they usually think I'm crazy.

So, and I was slowly falling asleep. At this point, I was somewhere between asleep and awake, and my boyfriend was fully asleep.

Suddenly, and as were running, his mom was running inside! Without us saying anything she told us her story!
""I was outside, almost submissive. She looked over to where our bedroom window was and said she saw a tall (about 7 feet) dark man standing right outside our window. As soon as he noticed her, he grew angry, and took off. She said he was so fast it was almost as if he disappeared before her eyes.

There are not many places he could have gone. Again

So, how was he so fast? Who was he? Where could he have possibly gone. Then, I really started to wonder...could it be a skinwalker?

Skinwalkers, some developed the ability to steal the skins of animals and utilize their powers. Some, however, started to use this power for evil.

Of course, I often stayed at my parents house on certain nights. Now, he lived on off a long, dark, and creepy road. I didn't want to go alone. So, this time I asked him to come along and have his mom follow me out.

Well, yet it was so bony, and almost had human like features. We didn't want to hit whatever it was as it crossed the street in front of our. We had to stop. As it was crossing it was just staring at us, in the most evil, vile manner. It honestly looked demonic, and in a strange way, cartoon-like. Coyotes normally run, his mom drove in front of us ""to break its path."" Many Navajo people believe that if a coyote (or whatever the hell this creature was) crosses your path

This happened a little over a year ago.  I work in supported living.  My job is to work one-on-one with mentally disabled adults, and I sleep on the couch at the client's (yeah its weird but that's what we are supposed to call them) home after they are asleep.  The man who's home I was at on this particular night is a 54 year old man with Downs Syndrome as well as a severe speech impediment.  He can only speak a small hand full of words, and even those come out stuttered and difficult to understand.  He communicates by using a repertoire of hand signals that he has come up with over the years and by occasionally writing/drawing crudely on paper.  He is a very sweet and affectionate man, but is pretty severely disabled cognitively.  He lives in a very old family home that he grew up in with his parents and siblings.  He has lived there for his whole life.  He was extremely close with his mother who died about 8 years ago after caring for him in their home for the duration of her time on earth.  His father died a few years before that.  He (my client) took her death very hard, and still occasionally has crying spells when he thinks of her and remembers she is gone.  He keeps a tattered photograph of her near him when he is home, and continually moves it around the house, showing it to me and referring to it frequently.  

The living room of the house has a huge black wood-burning stove for heating the house, stare at the spot, and growl at it menacingly.  Sometimes they would even run in from the kitchen barking like crazy, stop and growl at the spot for a bit before returning to normal.  Several times I saw the cat walking across the living room freeze in mid stride and stare at the same spot, rigid and alert, frozen for several minutes as if it was afraid of being seen.  Sometimes I would wake up late at night and see the cat sitting opposite me, awake and staring vigilantly at the same spot.
On this particular night around 9:00 I was sitting on the couch in the living room when BOTH dogs came tearing into the room barking like crazy, then emitted a squeal like they had been kicked.  They turned 180 and tore back out the room crying and whimpering in terror.  They ran all the way through the house and out the back door.  Weird, but I really wasn't perturbed and just wrote it off as dogs being stupid.  A little later my client came out of his room, looked at me, then pointed to the spot in question and gave me the hand signal for ""monster"" or ""ghost.""  He kept looking between me and the spot and speaking unintelligible syllables while I struggled to understand him.  Then he looked at me and did something I have never seen him do before or since.  He  took one finger and held it pointed at his throat and slowly dragged it from one side to the other before returning to his room.  I thought it was pretty weird, but I shook it off and went to sleep a bit later.  The couch that I sleep on is against the wall with the stove in the corner, meaning when I am lying on it, which is uncomfortably close.  I woke up in the middle of the night to some scraping sounds coming from the stove.  It was the sound of metal on metal and sounded just like a person using the hook thing to move the logs around and stoke the fire.  I thought this was odd and sat up fully awake, unmistakably and clearly enunciated ""WATCHING YOU."" I responded reflexively to feeling of air hitting my ear and my whole body jerked violently before the understanding of what I had heard followed and I froze.    I looked around... Nothing.  I even peeked into his room to see of he had somehow learned to speak and had said it from behind the door

Like I said, that it MUST have just been in my mind.  I never spoke to anyone about it and I tried not to think about it in the year since this happened, and just put it out of my mind until today.   I was chatting with a coworker who works in the same home.  We got on the topic of the client's habit of carrying on conversations when nobody is in the room with him.  He sometimes speaks to empty chairs as if there is someone sitting in them, and has full on conversations with breaks where he appears to be listening to a response, but his speech is unintelligible to us.  She said ""he's probably talking to his mom"" to which I responded jokingly ""do you think she haunts the house?""

She then admitted that she too had heard things in the house.  Whispers.  She described it exactly like what I had heard

I am writing this here in the house.  I can hear him in his room right now

I left a part out that may be important.  I realized after reading misterfk's response that I may actually have done something to unsettle the house.  

Here's the thing: my family, and ""sacrificed"" food to our idols daily, with large feasts for them several times a year.  These idols had been in the family for generations, and had been given sacrifices for decades.  

When my father left, and really prayed with faith.  I believed in it and whatnot.  I lost my faith when my father left, and converted to Christianity soon afterwards (I've since lost my faith in recent years after becoming a scientist). Well, I began seeing the room full of idols, which was coincidentally also the room in which I saw the ""shadow"" years earlier, as a hypocrisy against my new faith.  With my mothers permission, (she also converted), who was also a Pastor

My mother's faith in Christianity increased exponentially after that day, and they disappeared, and she never saw them again.  She interpreted it as the spirits of the idols leaving the house or something.

I dunno if this could have had any part to play in the whole situation

~~-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------~~

ORIGINAL STORY:

Throwaway

I'm writing this mainly to get it off my chest

I'll start at the beginning.

**BACKGROUND** (it's kinda long so scroll down if you wanna get to the creepy bits)

My parents bought the house from the bank after it had been foreclosed.  It was a massive three story home that at one point had been a boarding house, hired a contractor and refinished most of the inside. 

So my family was really happy before this. We very rarely fought, and was commuting to college in the city.  Being immigrants, both my parents worked A LOT, and had long commutes.  They were usually gone from 5 AM to 7-9 PM, sometimes later. Throught out 5th grade-6th grade, it was just my sister and me the entire evening.  My sister got married and moved out when i was in the 6th grade, so after that it was just me.

So enough background.  Here's the weird shit.

**THE STORY** (or several stories)

Shortly after moving into this house, which is weird because we rarely ever fought.  My dad became really distant.  He became apathetic and irresponsible, and my mother became incredibly high strung and stressed out.  Screaming matches between all four of us became an every day thing.

This was also when I started getting really terrible headaches, and had half a dozen brain scans without results.

I soon became terrified of the house.  I could never sleep in my own room. Never.  I'd be woken up every single night by what I could only describe as pure terror.  I would suddenly wake up feeling like something or someone was hovering over me

The thing is I never actually saw anything until one occasion. This was about a year after we moved in. I was walking home from school, hairs on end etc.  A second later the blinds  fell into place, swinging side to side as if someone holding them had let go.  Everyone had always avoided this room because it really did ""feel"" creepy.  It was always really cold, even in warm weather, to the point where my dad had to insulate the door because it would suck the heat out of the master bedroom.  This was especially strange because it was a tiny room with a full wall length hot water radiator.

Many people who have stayed at my house have commented that whenever they would leave the first floor

So my parents ended up splitting up.  My dad walked out on us, and really confused.  I was told afterwards that I would do really horrible things while I was having this ""sleep walking panic attacks"".  Once I jumped on a table and tried to stick myself in the (moving) ceiling fan.  Another time my mother found me wailing on the floor of the kitchen surrounded by cutlery. My mom finally told me recently what she saw that made her to gtfo of that house so suddenly. She was woken up one night by a sound, as me and her were sleeping on the floor of the living room.  She looked up in the dark to see what looked like a naked man, with the head and feet of a goat standing in the hall doorway.  It said something along the lines of ""I will have your husband, I will have your husband, He's mine. This house is mine.""  We moved out the following weekend.

About 6 months later, the constant headaches, and all the fear that plagued me for 4 years.  It was an immediate change.  I grew 8"" in a year, and put on 25 lbs.  I looked and felt great, it was a new me. 

I never returned to that house until a year ago, C, U respectively).  I told her not to do it, but she refused to listen and moved in anyway.

I left the country for 4 months on study abroad at that point. When I came back

They all (B, footsteps throughout the house.  One day, my aunt C had to use the bathroom, but was too afraid to walk there alone so she woke up her husband U.  They go to the bathroom, while U waits outside. He turns to the kitchen, adjacent, and suddenly sees a naked women

My mom decides to call a missionary friend over in order to pray over the house.  While they are doing the prayers loudly in a circle

I believe the final straw was when my mother was alone on the third floor.  She suddenly felt as if someone grabbed her braided hair and yanked it backwards.  She was alone in the house.

**THE HOUSE'S HISTORY**

The last part I need to add is the history of the house.  My mother had a conversation with the neighbor shortly after my dad left that freaks me out to this day.  My neighbor was in his late 80's at the time, and she committed suicide in the house.  The family directly after lived OK until the kids left.  The couple soon began fighting a lot, and then the husband died of a heart attack.  The wife became a shut in, and started going insane, screaming in the night.  She would leave all the doors and windows of the house wide open at all times even in the middle of winter, and the neighbors would have to go close them whenever they could.  The city finally stepped in and committed her to a mental hospital.  The bank took the house and sold it to us.

Tell me what you think.

His eyes just had a look of pure evil on them and he had this evil smile on his face. He laughed at us and said, "" You stupid b****es aren't going to let me die will you?"" and he laughed again.

I am a Roman Catholic

When I was 8 years old

He was murdered in his home one night and I'll never forget the phone call our house received at 2 in the morning and hearing my mother (my uncle's sister) screaming. Everything changed after that, but over the years we slowly pieced it together.

My uncle's killer was a poor man who would constantly ask my uncle for money, but I'm pretty scientifically ignorant), and he began a correspondence with a company here in the US that was interested in making a business deal. He soon made plans to come to the US on a business trip, but two nights before his departure, he woke up to the sound of a man breaking into his home. I won't go too much into details because it is a very sensitive subject, but it was the indeed the man who’d always badger him for money, and my uncle ended up being stabbed to death.

In the end this man somehow only served two years in prison, refuses to talk about the horrible subject to this day.

Being 8 years old, when I was older and I fully understood what happened, I became resentful of this mystery man, this symbol of depravity and murder that so hurt and damaged my family.

Over the years I eventually began to think of him less and less, thinking to myself that when the time came, his killer would be judged fairly by God.

Cut to me learning to AP,” or, aiding a soul who has passed from this earth into the next realm but for whatever reason was stuck from moving onto a higher realm (or, for many of us, ‘Heaven’). Soul retrievers aim to help these stuck souls; anything from just chatting with them and letting them know that they are indeed dead and that they need to move on, or just offering these troubled souls words of encouragement. I decided that being a soul retriever would be a privilege for me and an amazing opportunity to help a soul in pain.

A few nights before Christmas Eve, and that I never in a million years anticipated what would occur only a few nights later.

As I astral projected that night, crystal clear, exactly as I recalled it as a child (my family had sold my uncle’s home after his death and the family that moved in made extensive renovations). I quickly became joyful at the chance to possibly see my Uncle (my family and I have a history of experiencing visitations from our deceased loved ones) and have a chat with him, so I entered the house from the right side entrance (the entrance that only family members knew to enter), and stepped inside the kitchen, feeling the spiral staircase with my hands and the tile against my feet. “Tio ___?” I called out, smiling ear to ear, hoping for a response from him.

I was just about to take the stairs up (to the second level
“Who’s there?” a man called out in Spanish, hoping against hope that this wasn’t the man that I dreaded ever meeting. Silence was my response, but a specific kind of silence, the silence of omission and shame and guilt; the silence of remorse for being correctly identified for one’s terrible actions.

I quickly ran out the kitchen and back outside to the front yard
A man emerged onto the balcony, his gaze penetrating me.
“Who are you?!” I asked
“M____ N_____, as though seeking help, but I was still in complete shock. God had hand picked me to help soul retrieve my uncle’s murderer, and I found myself at a loss for words. 

I wish I could say I swallowed the bitter pill and that I did God proud, and that I could make good on my request to be a soul retriever. But I came up short, and in the end I proved myself to be an unworthy candidate as a soul retriever.

I impulsively started yelling at the man,” he’d call out to me, “I’m stuck!,” his forlorn expression trying to appeal to me on any level, but I was so emotional and angry that I made it clear that I wanted nothing to do with him. I then turned my back on him and walked away from the house, knowing that he couldn’t leave of his own volition. God had crafted this man’s purgatory to consist of being stuck in the house where he committed his worst deed, and being forced to have to relive it over and over again.

I woke up in my bed shaking and crying, “was Tio’s murderer’s name ‘M____ N_____?’” and I’ll never forget the face she made-one of shock, pain and disbelief. She burst into tears and left the room, and moments later as I consoled her, she confirmed that this was indeed the man, and as I described his physical features she only cried more, acknowledging that was indeed my uncle’s killer. I cried alongside her, but because of my failure-my idiocy. 

Why did I choose to fail this opportunity? Why couldn’t I have taken a step back, why couldn’t I forgive and try to love him as Jesus would have done? I felt and still feel so disgusted with myself and I fear that I’ll never again get the chance to be in a position to soul retrieve-that I failed my one shot. 

I just hope that my Tio isn’t too disappointed with me

What I saw when it got into my sightline is not something I've seen before or since. I saw a little person (a little humanoid?) dressed in black, taking impossibly large strides up my bed, beside my (terrified) body. It was slender, almost spindly, but well proportioned. I couldn't make out a gender, as it looked pretty androgynous but I ""sensed"" it was male. I remember thinking that it's facial features were as sharp as the rest of him.

Two. I was tired at the time but I hold firm to the conviction that I was awake enough to know what I saw

While on vacation in Arizona a few weeks ago I was visiting family who live on the edge of the Navajo nation, so after a night out catching up with my two old friends, whose names I will not mention because of the events that took place that night, I was driving the two of them home.

That said

Anyway, I'm there to answer the phones and dispatch someone for the body. I clean up a little and get a few things ready for funerals the next day. Not the most glamorous job, but the job market sucks right now. 

And even with my few duties, or sometimes I'll go lay down on one of the couches and take a power nap. I'm alone all night (other than a handful of bodies in different rooms) and it's boring. I think most people would do the same. 

The weird thing is, because I rarely have it at home. 

Now, but you're not *actually* awake. So sometimes, you still see or hear dream things. Like maybe you see something that isn't there, or whatever. And you can't move. It feels as though you're being held down and you can't wake up. It feels as if you are straining against something when you try. For myself, I can usually ""snap"" myself out of it and wake up if I strain and thrash against it hard enough, and then I come awake suddenly and am able to move. Google it if you want a more information about it. It's interesting. 

Now

The first was the music. Sometimes when I would find myself lying there with my eyes open in sleep paralysis, but modern stuff like you'd hear on the radio. It always sounded like it was coming from inside my skull, too, particularly my mouth area. This sounds stupid, but at one point I even began to wonder if I was picking up some AM Christian station in my fillings and was only sensitive enough to hear it while asleep, or maybe when my mouth was hanging open and dried out. I even went so far as to remember one of the lyrics from one of the songs and Google it when I woke up, although it didn't appear to be a real song. (Sorry

Then, I would always frantically strain against the sleep paralysis and wake up, at which point the sound of footsteps was gone. After that, I always felt foolish for getting tricked by dream sounds. 

This went on for months and months

One night, expecting I would either eventually wake up normally (without the strain) or I would go back to full sleep, or that the stupid footsteps would continue the way the music always did if I just laid there stuck in that state for a bit. 

**Nope.**  To my complete surprise

I was laying on my back stretched out, just a white male in some kind of dress shirt and slacks, except for one thing: his face and head were obscured. They were blurred out, just like they do on the news for anonymous witnesses or whatever. Just like that. His head and face were obviously there, but I could see nothing but a smeary blur. 

Then, ""Yeah, feel real brave now, don't you?""

And at that point, of course, to say the least. Probably not as much for most, though, to be honest, because I truly have NO belief in ghosts or the paranormal and chalked it up to brain tricks. But since then, it's happened twice more. 

The second time I saw someone, I knew immediately that it was just my sleep paralysis and didn't panic, but I was unnerved enough to force myself awake and cause the woman to vanish. 

The third time was similar to the first. I was laying on the couch and this time a small child approached me from behind. I think it was a boy but can't say for sure, that was the most disturbing by far. 

And that's it. That's my story. Sorry it doesn't have a better resolution

The only notable thing she experienced in the house was once when she had gone to sleep with her parents after having a bad dream.  She said that she and her mom woke up at the same time, and they could hear the typical footsteps going to the kitchen. She said that the door opened into the bedroom, so they would have seen someone closing the door had someone been there.  The door slam also woke up her dad.

She also told me an experience her brother had.  He was laying down on the couch in the living room, he said ""Hey, dad.""  He didn't get a response so he looked to see who it was and no one was there.

I'm just going to get straight to the point and list my experiences. Some are from my journal that I kept after things got to noticeable to ignore. Left some things out because they were pretty much the same thing happening again.

1. I was laying in bed about a month after moving in. (I lived alone) I was awoken by the distinct feeling that something was crawling onto my bed. I felt and saw the bed sink in. Shat bricks but I was exhausted so I dozed off again.

2. I was studying for school so I turned off everything except my lamp so that I could study in silence

3. My radio turned on by itself on and volume was raised all the way up at 3:47 a.m

4. I was awoken again one night by my bed shaken vigorously at around 3 am. I thought it might have been a tremor so I shrugged it off and went back to bed. Then I remembered that only my bed was shaking and nothing else in my room or apartment was disturbed. 

5. I was having my forever alone t.v dinner reading over one of my essays for school. I hear a loud rumbling roar that sounded like a Lion roar. It shook me straight to my core I said nope! enough is enough I am outta here I left to my parents house that night.

At this point I am questioning my sanity and the apartment is making me stress out because I can't afford to move out. This stress cripples my ability to focus in school. 

6. Sitting on my couch watching a comedy movie trying to lighten the mood

7. Finally the straw that broke the camels back, It gets dead silent for a few seconds until all of a sudden I get a shock pass through my body (It felt surreal) and then my king size bed starts shaking violently with me on it. I felt like I was on a carnival ride, from hell! I spring up from my bed to get my car keys and I start to hear the walls around me being banged, As if several sets of hands were slapping the walls. I damn near killed my self trying to hastily leave that apartment, knocking things over and jammed my foot on a wall because I slid on my socks across the floor. 

I never went back (only to retrieve my belongings) but other than that I broke lease and never returned.

1374642720.0,1ixs62,[fam] Navajo friend recounted a skinwalker tale that happened to her mom.,redheadedalex,92,14,42,"Note: I know, my Navajo friend told me a personal story years and years ago that I never shared.  I emailed her asking for an update since I forgot the details and here they are


This story happened to my friend’s (we’ll call her Kat) mom.  Kat was just a kid, strong, alpha as fuck, and not afraid of the vast endless desert around her or animals or any of that shit.  

One night business as usual.  Dad is out working a long grave shift, and goes into the kitchen and gets out six slices of bread, three pieces of bologna (res status=pro) and cheese and mayo, as she is about to put these fine artesian sandwiches together she hears a sound and turns to look at the front door.

The front door is wide as fuck open and there’s a woman in the doorway.  She’s short, with blond hair.  She was dressed for summer apparently with shorts and a t shirt on and flip flops and she had a pixie haircut. And she was dirty and raggedy, which is not uncommon if you’ve ever been around the res land. White people on the res are kind of a joke, depending on where they go it can be reeeeally dangerous for them, so they’re not seen as much of a threat.  Apparently Kat’s mom was of the attitude of “what the fuck are you doing in my house?”  She asked the woman several things, like, what are you doing here, etc.  The woman didn’t reply and seemed to be in a weird state of mind.

Being a cop’s wife her first impression was that this was some white moron who’d tried a little too much peyote and got lost from her moron friends in the desert.  So she was being pretty harsh to the girl and was kind of pissed that she’d gotten into the house with no words at all in the first place.  Kat’s mom got annoyed when the girl wouldn’t answer her and just stood there kind of giggling and shrugging her shoulders.  So she put her hands on the girl’s shoulders and literally pushed her outside onto the porch steps of the trailer and the woman just stood there

And this was when she realized something was off.  She had first thought the girl was on drugs or something, no nothing except covered in dirt like she’d wallowed in it.  She smelled bad too, like a wild animal.  So Kat’s mom stood there slowly realizing that maybe she wasn’t taking this seriously enough.  And the woman on the porch steps really started to jitter then, kind of like she was cold, but more unnaturally.  And this was in summer in the Arizona desert so there should have been no need for that.  Kat’s mom slammed the door, which had one of those diamond windows on it that trailers have, and she could see the woman violently spasming through the glass.  She looked away for seconds, the woman was gone.  





Kat’s mom said her first thought was to go to the kids, too.  So she decided to stay in the bedroom with them.  Apparently this was the safe part of the trailer, since they blessed it with cedar smoke often (for the kids) and there were eagle feathers hanging up on the walls and doorways (to the Navajo, these keep bad spirits away.) 

So, so that’s kind of an every night thing and something she’s used to.  Apparently she was more afraid to go into the kitchen, and couldn’t shake the feeling of why.  She just had this feeling of dread.  This was before the days of cell phones so she had no way of getting in touch with anyone.  A few hours passed and things had been quiet but she couldn’t sleep, so she decided to call her husband.  The phone was in the living room, which meant she would have to go near the kitchen, but not into it.  She snuck out of the kids’ room and grabbed the phone, called the station, and Kat’s mom agreed.  She went back to the bedroom to wait for the knock on the door.  She was a good half hour from anywhere

He was a coworker of her husbands, and Kat’s mom said that he seemed nervous and jumpy while standing on her porch.  He took a statement from her of what had happened but he said he’d seen no one on the roads, definitely nobody fitting that description.  They set up a patrol to search the area for the night just in case, and they discussed maybe burning some sage or cedar since the air seemed bad...in a creepy, off way, not a smelly way....and she thanked him and went into the kitchen.  Seeing the officer and having a conversation had calmed her down enough that she didn’t feel the need to barricade in the bedroom anymore.  So she went over to the kitchen (burning cedar and sage is usually done on the stovetop) and it was then that she noticed the counter and Kat said her mother was the most terrified she’d ever been in her life.   

The bread, though they’d been there hours earlier and she for a fact had not moved them, and had also for a fact deadbolted the door.  Kat’s mom’s theory is that the “woman” had come back into the trailer while everyone was in the bedroom and had taken the food, and that’s why she (the mom) had instinctively been afraid to come back in that area.  

As far as I know that’s the one incident where something got into their home.  She’s never told me of anything else

1370391681.0,1fospp,Another Skinwalker Tale [FAM],redheadedalex,94,21,27,"Hey guys.

I know I promised more skinwalker stories on my other posts/comments

  But I did manage to get one more story for now.

This happened to my older brother, one of which included walking through the woods late at night to, as he called it, ""throw rocks and terrorize kids from school.""  Yes, immature, I know, but he and his accomplice (another Navajo called ""Sean"") were seniors and tackles on the football team.  They walked through the woods because cops patrolled the streets

So one night they were sneaking through the forest before the sun had risen, until Sean stopped David, grabbed him and said, ""Get down!"" 

They dropped to their stomachs and hid, were accompanied by mumbling.  David estimated that the sounds were maybe 100 feet away at first, but got closer.  He doesn't know if the mutterings were Navajo or English or some other language.  After awhile of the noises staying fairly far away, Sean whispered without looking, ""It sounds like a drunk.""  Several more minutes and David decided to chance a peek, as the ""drunk"" sounded more distant now.  

It was night, and walking on two feet, but misshappen and VERY tall.   He said it maybe resembled a kokopelli or Navajo kachina doll, so not exactly normal shaped.  It mumbled and drifted through the trees seemingly looking for something.   He was pretty captivated, watching it for a few minutes and then suddenly the snapping twigs and the mutterings just stopped.  Everything was quiet.  And the figure, whatever it was, had just disappeared.

After that, it would have known we were both staring.""  

I forgot to ask him if he and Sean went back through the woods, but they're not skinwalker stories.  Still if you guys are interested, I'll give it a shot.

My great-uncle and his wife and two daughters moved into the house in the late 1960s when his kids were pretty young.  The girls each picked their own bedrooms.  In the morning after one of the first nights they all slept over at the house, why did you let your friends come up to my room last night?""  My great-aunt told her that she must have been dreaming, that she hadn't had anyone over that night.  About an hour later, the other daughter woke up and came downstairs (having had no interaction with her sister yet that morning) and told her mother, ""Mom, why were those people standing around my bed last night?""

After that, and by the time she returned to the stairwell, the colonial woman had disappeared.

It wasn't the last that the family saw of the woman, they realized that the wall she was ""disappearing"" through used to have a door in it!  Also during the renovations, my great-uncle took pictures of the rooms that he had redone.  When he had the pictures developed, one of them had a clear figure of a woman floating about 2 feet off the ground in the corner of one of the bedrooms.  He didn't show me that picture until I was a little bit older, as it is pretty creepy. 

Apparently the activity tapered off as my mom's cousins got older, was that when my great-aunt would put flowers in a vase, some of the flowers would be removed from the vase and placed elsewhere.

The last time I saw my great-uncle before he died, much closer than he had ever been to her before.  I said, ""Ew, how creepy!"" He was really funny about it, though, and said, ""Oh no

1338667943.0,uhl7u,[FAM] Ran out of gas in a rural area...,NotKiddingJK,92,15,11,"Didn't happen to me

He walked up the road to the first farmhouse. There was a gas pump out front as many farmers keep a decent supply on hand. He walked up the driveway and knocked on the door. An elderly couple answered and he explained his situation. They were kind and happy to help. The husband got him a can and they went to the pump and he put a couple of gallons of gas from the pump into the can. My uncle walked back to the car and put the gas in the tank. He brought the can back and offered them some money for the gas. They wouldn't take any money and just said they were glad they could help. He thanked them and drove home.

My uncle looks like a lumber jack. He was 6' 6"" tall over 300 lbs with a full beard. He was one of those gentle giant kind of guys and although you would never guess it by looking at him one of his favorite things was to bake pies. So the next day he bakes a pecan pie to bring back to the couple who gave him the gas. He drove back to the house and knocked on the door

He drove down the road to the next house and went to the door to see if he could leave the pie with the neighbors. When he talked to the neighbors they told him the house he was talking about had been abandoned. Figuring he must have gone to the wrong house he drove along the road looking for the right place. When he couldn't find another farmhouse that looked anything like the one he got the gas from he drove back a second time.

The gas pump was there and he was sure that it was the right house, but they've been dead for years.

On New Years Eve of 2008 I attended a party at a friend's apartment. The complex was big and new-ish

Around the climax of the party, with a little stand of Birch trees about 25 feet away. As I was smoking, I wandered towards the little stand of trees and stood beneath them, looking up at the apartment building in front of me. 

The apartment building was three stories high, and because the room was illuminated, I could see in to it fairly well.

It looked as if someone were sitting on the edge of a bed, and just assumed they were sitting on a bed. My immediate thought was that maybe the person was upset, because I know when I'm really upset or stressed, I have a tendency to rock myself back and forth, but as I looked, I noticed that there were no distinct features that I could identify, it just looked like a solid black cut-out of a person. 

So, I get the creepy feeling that this 'person' is suddenly aware of my awareness of it, like somehow it knew I was watching and was feeding on my energy/reaction. Slowly, it began to move about in a really unnatural way, standing up from whatever it was sitting on. Its arms lifted up and out from it's body and began to basically undulate. It almost looked like pop and lock style dancing, but the arms were bending in ways that a human arm could not possibly bend, like it had joints in all the wrong places. Fear erupted inside of me because I realized that it wasn't human

I stood there staring at it because I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I wanted to run

As it was doing its scary arm thing, but I could still FEEL it there. 
 
I ran back to my friend's apartment, I couldn't explain to them what I had seen.

1376162000.0,1k3pgs,"[PIC] [ME] [FAM](?) I've only ever told this story to a few very close friends, My most cherished story. The story of my ducks and their departure. (very long read)",TheHiddenCount,83,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1k3pgs/pic_me_fam_ive_only_ever_told_this_story_to_a_few/

I recently created this account to post my several paranormal and strange stories specifically. This following story is one that remains very close to my heart, but as I said this is a very special story and I'm writing it out for the first time.

I will begin by saying that I am a sceptic as well as an agnostic athiest. I always question everything, that strange things can and DO happen, yet our current technology limits our understanding and ability to explain these occurrences.

 Thus begins my story.

I love ducks. I love ducks and waterfowl so much, but I became fascinated by the idea of imprinting, and developed a healthy obsession for knowledge about ducks/geese/swans and their social behavior. 

During my childhood, he had little understanding of just how delicate the process was, and how to distinguish fertile eggs from infertile.)

By the time I was 16, hamsters....I really have an affinity for animals. None have died in my care (except from simply getting old....rodents have short life spans.) and I've only ever given them away when I couldn't care for the animal myself. 

At the time I had my awesome dog and some cute little fish. My mom had made it clear that she didn't want any more animals in the house. Well, perhaps some act of rebellion from a teenager who loves animals. I became damned determined and was willing to go behind my mother's back. Better than doing drugs, I suppose.  

I didn't want to just purchase ducks

Before I decide to adopt any animal, [I opt for this cheap plastic one](http://www.critter-cages.com/images/gq09100.jpg) which I bought online. It's made for classroom and educational purposes, I suppose. This incubator is extremely tricky. In fancier incubators, there is usually a rack, which turns the eggs, and a self adjusting monitor for temp and humidity regulation. The success rate of my incubator, since I had to turn the eggs manually 7 times a day and regulate the temp and humidity myself

After the incubator came, that I can come back and get another one. I pick out two good looking eggs.

It takes 28 days for most ducks to hatch. I sang, simply by hearing the mother duck's voice. A mother duck will softly 'talk' to her eggs as she rotates them, making a little 'wuhwuhwuh' noise. I tried to emulate that by talking softly to them as I rotated them. I began to feel a very strong connection with them, even before they hatched. I would candle them every day to check for abnormalities.

Eventually my mother found out....but after her initial rage from me hiding the ducks from her, she would let me keep them). She was even involved in helping me with the hatching process! The whole family became involved. 

The special day rolls around

[Here are some screenshots of the video we took of them hatching](http://imgur.com/a/fEeuv) (I still tear up when I watch this video):

Fast forward some, can not be potty trained (for any length of time) because of their lack of sphincter muscles. For this they make bird diapers. Birds, as I'm sure you all know, poop A LOT. The ducks poop was getting a little out of hand and REALLY big. My mom finally decided that I needed to build a pen for them outside (I took them outside regularly but we have a lot of hawks in the area so I was always on guard. They stayed inside and wandered the house otherwise. The poop became too much to deal with, even for me, who is experienced in the cleaning of animal poop. 

I have NO experience with pen building at this point, some help from my brother, and my own perseverance. The enclosure ended up being pretty decent. I made sure to make it as large as possible, and it was entirely closed in with chicken wire, including the floor, with a hinged door so I could enter. I even built a little shelter area, and bought a plastic kiddie pool for them. I was really quite proud of it. They loved being outside, which keeps them waterproof

At this point, and I will tell you bullshit- and I love dogs. I'd go out every day after school, let them out, sit down, and they would waddle in to my lap and demand to be pet by nibbling me. Ducks give little beak kisses as a sign of affection, and it feels like soft little nibbles. I would run out every day and call 'DUCKS, DUCKS!' to which they'd respond with a little happy duck noise. It's not so much of a quack as it is a soft excited 'wahkwahkwahkwahk!' My love for them was and is still unmatched...I say this even though the dog I have now is the love of my life. 
 
About 3 weeks pass

One early morning I awake to my dog barking (she loved the ducks too and protected them when we were all out in the yard. I think seeing a dog play with ducks is the cutest unnatural thing you could witness).

I run to the door to see that my mom had already let the dog out. She told me

I go outside. I start walking quickly back to the pen

I scream 'DUCKS!!!' .....No answer
'DUCKS!!!!' ......silence 

Subconsciously I knew what had happened before I even got to the pen. As I walk up....all I see is a bunch of feathers scattered across the floor. I look in the kiddie pool

 I could barely make it out (I have terrible eyesight, was the lower half of Ooccoo's body- the tail and the hindside- bobbing up and down. Anser was nowhere in sight. 

I collapsed to the floor, and my mom let me stay home from school. The whole family cried, but I was a wreck. I had never cried all day before. I only left to use the restroom....I wouldn't eat, and I didn't talk to ANYONE, not even my brother. I slept and cried and then fell back asleep and then woke up again and cried myself back to sleep. My mom had called my stepdad home from work, and he dealt with the bodies since neither I nor my Mom could bare it.

This is where the supernatural part of my story begins. 

That night I have a dream. It's more vivid than any regular dream. I'm in this strange room and there's a chimney

I approach the chimney and a bright light flashes, except they were human size. I then notice something a little off about them....

Ooccoo's beak was missing. As though it were a half of a beak. Anser's stomach was dented- concave if you will. It wasn't gory

I remember apologizing to them and screaming that I'm so sorry. I should have built the cage better to keep stronger animals out. I said that I'll take even better care of them if they just come back. I said that I was a bad person

All of a sudden a feeling of calm washes over me. They never talked verbally, love is all that matters.  Love that spans over individuals, cultures, species, and the entire universe. Then they 'told' me that it was time for them to leave, and they would be one with the universal everything again. That it was peaceful and not to worry. I screamed that I loved them and they were back up the chimney in a flash of light.

The next day I told my parents of the dream, but I could see that he was shaken.) He then said, after some pause (not word for word, but as best as I can remember), ""I didn't want to give you guys any details about this, but when I pulled Ooccoo's body out of the water, his beak had been bitten off. Anser was by the woods

I look at them in shock...my mom puts her hands to her mouth. My stepdad hadn't told her or anyone about what he saw

In closing, I never walked past the pen. The woods is a long distance away, and there is no fucking way I saw Anser. Just no way. 

Now

My stepdad really DID tell my mom

I DID see Ooccoo's beak subconsciously (i swear I didn't, and my brain deduced that Anser must have been eviscerated since that is usually what predators will do to their prey before consuming them. 

But something in my mind- something in my heart- and however you want to think of a soul, space, and everything above and below. I'm tearing up right now, so I'll stop there. 

[Sadly

Ooccoo and Anser

Thank you for reading

TL;DR: I had two ducks- whom I loved very much. They died and showed themselves to me in a dream before they left
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT

Another detail I just remembered. After a week I finally muster enough strength to go outside and clean their pen so we can tare it down. Inside the pen were two mourning doves. I entered the pen and they tried flying out. One exited the pen immediately and the other landed at my feet. I approach it and IT ALLOWED ME TO PICK IT UP. I had it perched on my hand as I walked out of the pen, it flew off. In the pen, I find two feathers. just two. [I took this picture just now of them](http://i.imgur.com/KzM1CGS.jpg) .  I would have kept as many as I could find if there were more...One from Ooccoo, and one from Anser. I'm 22 now, and to this day I keep them in my keepsake box, and when I'm ever really sad or depressed, I take the feathers out

ANOTHER NEAT SEMI-RELATED THING THAT I WANTED TO SHARE

Her sister returns with a tape recorder and begins fast forwarding through the tape inside of it. She stops on the end of a recording of the sisters singing. That recording ends then a new one begins. It begins with what sounds like a fan running. The voice that speaks sent chills down my spine and still does as I think about it right now. It sounds like it should be a man but the voice is too deep to be human. He speaks garbled words in a slow tongue. Then a child says ""Hi, I'm Kelly. I'm 5 years old."" Kelly speaks a bit more but she is hard to understand. She ends with ""What's your name?"" The voice replies with more slow, garbled words. Then it speaks the only words I could understand. ""Can you sing me a song."" Then Kelly sings. She sings some old lullaby. One that is familiar but I can't quite remember it. Then the voice sings with her. Just for a few seconds the deep, slurred voice follows her lead in the song.

Then the recording ends.

My friends suggested I post this on /r/Paranormal[1] since it has kind of become a campfire tale of mine

So this was about 13 years ago

Let me explain the layout of the rooms in the story that matter real quick. My room as at the top left corner and my bed is against the right wall. The room is connected to the hallway by the door near the end of the bed. Right across from my room is the kitchen

""Nothing was really off about the night

He threw in the homestyle popcorn my mom really loved and was sitting there.

""I heard something from your room

My dad went to check it out and he says he saw something that totally freaked him out.

""I wasn't on drugs

What he saw at the end of my bed was a little girl in a black gown, looked at him and then went back to staring at me.

""Holy shit, we didn't let you sleep in there. We brought you into the living room and you fell asleep with us later that night, well I didn't sleep much.""

So that is what most people think is the end of the story

It rained pretty hard that day, sometimes the ocean threw nasty little storms at you.

Well that night

1356048686.0,1573ul,They Fed [Me] &amp; [FAM],maggieque84,99,26,20,"Some background: I come from a family of two sisters and a younger brother. In the late 80's we moved to a town house. It was a major upgrade from living in my Aunt's garage. We were very poor and my parents both struggled but never failed to provide for us. While living with my Aunt we were very young. She would have us crammed into a small bedroom to sleep in. I remember that at the time there was a ""skeleton man"" that would come out every night and would glide a long the wall and up to the ceiling and out the locked bedroom door. Looking back I have no logical way to explain it. Whatever it was appeared to be flat one dimensional skeleton that glowed. The window of the ranch house we lived at faced the backyard which was surrounded by heavy forest. No car lights had any means of shining into the window. I remember crying every time I'd see it and yell for Mom until she would unlock the door and open it. That would make the ""skeleton man"" disappear. It may have been just a conjured image in my three year old brain but I still remember it. It wasn't a scary thing to me

 When we moved into the town house it was a new start for us. I was four and I hated change. I even protested when we got new beds. God I must have annoyed the hell out of my parents. I was a stickler to old things and hated letting anything go. During that time I remember I would see things out of the corner of my eye. Quickly I would turn to look and nothing would be there. The most common thing I would see was a boy in a suit, nothing all too memorable. I went to my Mom too about the whispers and she responded ""Don't ever answer back. Don't talk to it."" Which confused me even more but being that my Mom told me not to talk to whatever it was I obeyed.

 It all exploded when I turned thirteen. A lot of things in my family's lives were changing. My oldest sister Rebecca was sixteen and my younger sister Trish was twelve. My younger brother Bryan was turning ten. My parents had better jobs

 My first memory of whatever it was that came in was the tapping. We lived in this house for years so we knew of the sounds that the building would emit. This tapping was like someone taking their finger nail and striking it against a wall. Very sharp taps. Rebecca and I stood in the hallway between rooms at one point and listened with all the bedroom doors open as the tapping was happening in her room. I said ""Stop it!"" and it stopped immediately. We stared at each other in shock as moments passed and suddenly the tapping resumed in my room. Rebecca yelled at it to stop and it finally did.

 My bedroom had the crawl space door in it and nothing ever happened that was strange before then. At one time I was sitting in my bedroom drawing when it sounded like someone reared their fist back and punched my closet door from the inside. It was a metal door and the sound was very loud. I had my back to the door and I just felt all the hair rise from my neck and I rose to my feet and quickly left my room. An hour later I returned and with all the bravery I could muster opened my closet door. Nothing was misplaced nothing had fallen. The crawl space door wasn't moved. There would be loud crashing like someone took one of our box fans and threw it to the ground

 At night I would try to go to bed and in the darkness it just felt like I was being watched. My siblings felt the same way too. It was impossible to sleep on my back because it just felt like there was something hovering in the darkness. I'm a very skeptical person and I would try to explain to myself what these sensations must be but I could never just rationally solve it. There would sometimes be phantom water droplets that would land on my face in the night. It felt like icy cold water and I would go and wipe my face and nothing would be there. At one point I was sitting on my bed with my back to my closet door and it felt like one of the cats jumped onto my bed with a lot of weight. I looked behind me and there was nothing there. It actually made me bounce up from where I was sitting. I quickly left my room when that happened. The only time I could ever get a restful nights sleep was keeping my light on and turning on my TV which was one of those big glass console ones. There was a hum it gave off that just seemed to drown out these unsettling feelings. It's hard to explain. One of the things I hated the most was the breathing. Before I finally decided to sleep with my light on and TV there were nights I would think I would hear someone breathing in my room. I would hold my breath and think, You're hearing things.' But there would be a long deep breath coming from some where in the room. I would spring up and run to my little sister's room and sleep there.

 Things started to get moved around in the house. Objects would disappear and reappear hours later. Keys

 One morning my sister Rebecca's screams woke me up. Trish and I ran to her room to find she had kicked off her blankets and she was in an absolute state of panic. From mid thigh down to her ankles it looked like someone had taken their finger tips and trailed blood down her legs. It wasn't simply a blood trail it looked like smeared blood from God knows where. She had no cuts or anything on her. Around this time we started to see things out of the corners of our eyes. They were always men but they looked the same black and white like that boy etc. It was unsettling and the noises and whispers escalated. At this time whenever we would open our front door we would see out of our peripheral something shoot out from the house. It looked like a translucent orange guinea pig thing with black strips. My Dad is a hardcore skeptic and atheist and he even saw it too. If you have cats that are indoor/outdoor you'd understand that whenever you open any door leading outside you keep a look out for any cats.

 The atmosphere of the house was oppressive. It was like you were swimming in molasses when you walked through the door. Stupidly one day Trish decided to bring a friend over with an Ouija board. They tinkered around with it until they both started feeling sick. I came into the room and scolded them and suddenly it felt like something latched itself to my arms with a great deal of weight. I felt my shoulders pop and sink and lifting my hands was painfully difficult like something was holding on and trying to drag me down. Quickly we disposed of the Ouija board and the same idiot friend who brought the board burned sage and I felt relief from the weight on my arms. At that point I had enough and finally decided to talk to my Mom about what was going on. I caught her one day just coming home from work and I asked her what to do. She explained to us to not fear it. To tell it to leave because it had no choice but to if you demanded it. Fearing it gave it power.

 It was hard to not be afraid so I unattached myself from the situation. I ignored the tapping

 Something inside her changed soon after. It was the first day she came home without a bottle of Jack Daniels (she would go through a bottle in less than three days). Her mood seemed brighter and she insisted on taking us to Blockbuster to rent movies

 The mood began to lighten in the house. Laughter began to fill it again. It had been almost five years without it. We felt like a family again and my Dad eventually came back. The strange occurrences lessened and when they did we would snap. ""Go away! You're not welcome here! Leave!"" Cats weren't being teleported anymore

 I was doing chores one day listening to my portable CD player and doing dishes in the kitchen. I was in my own little world when out of the corner of my eye I saw a man crouched five feet away from me in front of the fridge. He looked black and white much like the others

**[WARNING: WALL OF TEXT]**

When I was ten, but I loved it.  Anyway, we had a very loud, obnoxious camp counselor who was always trying to force his version of Christianity on us.  Whenever we'd ask a question, he'd give us a ten minute theological lecture and two or three personal anecdotes.  One night, as we were going to sleep, he told us one of his stories.  

Apparently, fire-and-brimstone mold, and he was always warning them about Hell and the temptations of Satan.  After one particularly furious sermon, they went back to their tent pretty annoyed with having to sit through such a ridiculous rant.  They started to make fun of the pastor, and eventually one of them yelled out for Satan to show himself if he were there.  Our counselor said the air started to chill, and the wind started to pick up.  Then, their tent shook, then like it was in a hurricane.  They all started screaming

Now, too applicable to us; it seemed more like an object lesson than a real story.  I should also mention that I was having a lot of problems with Christianity itself at the time.  It was nothing deep or philosophical--I was ten after all--but I just couldn't connect with the church or the people in it.  So, for several reasons, I didn't believe the story.  But I couldn't let it rest like that; I had to prove to myself that it wasn't real.  So, after the counselors were asleep, I snuck out of our building and walked into the woods.  The camp's security obviously could have used some work.

I walked through the woods a little ways until I found a clearing, but as loud as I thought I could get away with.  Stuff like ""So where are you, Satan?"" and such.  It sounds stupid, and it was, but I really wanted to show myself that the story was fake; in retrospect, I'm not sure why I needed that so much.

So, I just yelled for something to come out and show itself, basically copying what my counselor had said.  Just a few seconds after the words came out of my mouth, I felt the air change.  I cannot explain it to you easily.  It was cold, *very* cold, but it also felt like my body was electrified; I could feel a tingling on my skin.  I can still feel it.  The wind didn't pick up like in my counselor's story.  Quite the opposite: what small breezes there had been stopped completely, and everything was perfectly still and silent.  Then

It was a man, but not abnormally so.  He looked at me for a few seconds, and then he smiled.  I cannot begin to describe to you that smile other than to say that it was the stuff of nightmares.  I think C.S. Lewis must have had a similar experience in his life, because this quote from his (fictional) book *Perelandra* says it better than I ever could:

""It looked at Ransom in silence and at last began to smile. We have all often spoken—Ransom himself had often spoken of a devilish smile.  Now he realised that he had never taken the words seriously. The
smile was not bitter, in an ordinary sense, sinister; it was not even mocking. It seemed to summon Ransom, with a horrible naiveté of welcome, into the world of its own pleasures, as if all men
were at one in those pleasures, it had nothing of the conspirator in it. It did not defy goodness, it ignored it to the point of annihilation.  Ransom perceived that he had never before seen anything but half-hearted and uneasy attempts at evil. This creature was whole-hearted. The extremity of its evil had passed beyond all struggle into some state which bore a horrible similarity to innocence""

That is it.  It looked as pure in its evil as I suppose the angels look in their goodness.  Like it had never once given a thought to anything good or kind or wholesome.  I cannot tell you how terrible it is to look into the eyes of something like that.

I ran.  I think I screamed, I guess--for someone, anyone to save me from that thing in the woods.  I made it back into our building, waking a few fellow campers on the way, but I went straight to my bed and under the covers.  I kept praying and praying, for hours, and I suppose they were heard

So that's my experience.  I've only talked about it with my parents and three close friends before now.  I've since come back to Christianity on my own terms, though, at 22, I am afraid of the dark.  It's hard for me to look into mirrors sometimes, because I'm afraid that I will see that face again.  I can't watch any horror movies with demons in them; I literally had to walk out of *Paranormal Activity 2* after my friends cajoled me into going.  I cannot abide silence.  Basically, the experience has affected me ever since, and I don't know how to let it go.  If anyone with similar experiences can offer me any advice,,False,t3_lbkfb

First let me say that I'm a female in my mid 20s. By all means I'm a normal person with a normal life for people of my demographic. I have never been diagnosed with any mental disorder

This happened about 3 months ago and I want people's honest opinions.

It was about 7pm one Saturday and my roommate wanted me to go to the mall and then out to get a drink with her with some other friends. I wanted a nap so I told her I'd skip the mall and meet her at them at the bar at 9pm. I had not had anything to drink at that point in at least a week and a half

My roommate left for the mall and I laid down to take my nap. I left the kitchen light on so my room wasn't totally dark. I fell asleep and woke up to the sight of my alarm clock showing it was 8:45. Immediately I thought my roommate was already back because besides my alarm clock it was completely dark which lead me to believe she turned the kitchen light out. At this point I was still very groggy

Here's where it gets weird... All of a sudden out of nowhere an ink black ""shadow"" came out of my wall

Before going into the rest of the story I will describe this thing's appearance. It was about 5'9 and of human stature. It's cloak covered up it's entire body besides the head. It's face alone was horrifying... very small slit for a mouth, but the appearance alone wasn't what was the worst: It was it's expression. It looked at me as if it had a deep disdain and hatred for all human beings and everything we are. 

I was so deeply afraid and shaken that I couldn't cry. I asked who it was and it communicated the name ""Satan"" in a very condescending way. It didn't speak

The next thing I remember I woke up on the floor in that very spot and all the lights were on. The clock said 9:50

I have no idea what happened... Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and I am not a schitzophrenic. 

Has anyone had any experience like this? I just can't believe it was a dream... I've had lucid dreams before and this seemed absolutely real.

Back in May 2010 (or '11. I don't quite remember. Oops.), GA for a week long vacation. I had a kidney infection at the time (relevant), but I'd be damned if we cancelled that stupid vacation. 
For those not too familiar with the city, we went on a ghost tour our second night there. It was kitschy and campy and spooky and fun until we went to this particular house. The tour guide told us (I assumed he was trying to freak us out) that if you felt like you couldn't approach the house, then don't. sit at the park bench over there and we'll pick you up. He wasn't joking. You knew this house the minute it came into site. It was terrible. I mean I really can't emphasize how horrible this place is. 

to beging with, and this Lady has already done it much more eloquently and detailed than I could do it, so credit where it's due. However, there are some bits of history I got that she didn't know/include, so a lot of this stuff is straight from me.


The first death was that of a little girl in the late 1800's. She died due to a neglectful father

The next deaths were in 1959. 
&gt; a family ... came to visit the doctor and his family living at [The house]. The visiting family included four daughters, and one was sprawled on the front porch, as if she was slain while trying to escape. The youngest daughter, age four, was the only one still alive. The sad and senseless triple murder was never solved.

Not included on the site above is this bit, dark, bible thumpin' south, they were quickly chased out of town. This is, apparently, when shit got real. We move onto the next bit. 

&gt; In the 1990s, crying and, even more mysterious, a lot of giggling. I spoke to a local resident who sometimes feels such a negative emotion emanating from the house that she can’t even walk past it. One of her acquaintances lived at the house for a time, **but he disappeared while living there**, and the mysterious circumstances make her wonder if his disappearance is somehow related to the paranormal activity at the house.

Now shit hits the fan. Our tour guide was a close friend of this missing young man. Apparently, and an evil looking old dude in his room (I think I caught a pic of this old man. Will be in pics at the bottom). As stated above, the young man disappeared. Our tour guide also seemed to think it was related to the house.

The last bit to happen here was in the early 00's. A young family moved in, the woman who owns the house refuses to rent it out. She believes anyone who lives there will come to be harmed.

So

When you first start looking at the house, is that you *know* when ever you looked into a window, or through the gate to the back yard, you were looking at something. You just couldn't see it simply because *it just didn't want you to see it.* There was always something there, just beyond site. To me, that's one of the scariest things about this house.

After a few minutes, until I noticed how still everything was. The leaves weren't rustling or making a sound at all. it was a perfectly still night. The cold didn't let up until we left the house.

After we got the background on the house, and you could see it illuminate the inside of the lower floor. On the third or fourth shot, however, it was different. The entire interior of the house lit up red. Only briefly, just as long as the flash. Every one saw it, and they guy decided he had had enough picture taking for the night. Our group moved on. 

But something about that house fucked with me. I didn't want to be near it. I knew if I was to stay so close to it for the remainder of the week

But here's where the house really starts to scare me, as much as for some reason, I have this terrible fascination with it. I wouldn't say I'm obsessed with it, but once I start thinking or talking about it, I'm stuck on it for a few days. I just want to know more about it. It apparently had this same affect on my mom and friend, but it seems to have teetered off over tie with them with them.

Even sitting here now

Some say that children see the world much differently than adults, built during or shortly after WW2.

This evening was no different than the other times I had been there, stand there doing the pee-pee dance all night or man up and head through the kitchen and all the way down the long dark hallway to the bathroom at the other end of the house.

Gathering up my courage I headed through the kitchen and down the black hallway, every hair on my body stood up and I stood there frozen in terror.  I dared not move my head to look but I could see out of my peripheral as a shadow stepped from one of the bedrooms to my left.  It was short, hunched over and not much taller than I was.  It stood there in the hallway facing the wall but with its head turned towards me.  I could do nothing but stand there with a stupid look on my face, I could feel whatever it was eying me as if it were shocked that I could see it, as if it were thinking ""What the hell"" and when it came to the realization that I could see whatever it was the shadow quickly turned its back to me and glided the rest of the way down the hallway and disappeared into a bedroom at the end of the hall.  I didn't ask questions nor did I pretend to be brave, I ran....I ran like the scared little hobbit I was.  Whatever this thing was Alice lived alone with this thing in her home, maybe she couldn't see it but I sure as hell could.  I snatched the keys from my moms purse and went and sat in the car until she was finished, she never forced me to go with her after that.

I am a 24/m with no history of mental or physical illness that could possibly explain this. What I am about to share with you does not come easily for me in the least. Mostly because I already know trying to explain my experience is going to make me sound fucking crazy. But I'd much rather sound crazy anonymously to the internet than sound crazy to my close friends. I'm kind of worried about how they might react.

I'll get right to it and try to fill in any necessary details around it. Sorry if it's hard to follow. Bear with me

We had been at the casino for three days now. Earlier that month we had stayed close to two weeks. Not sure why, I'm not complaining.

During that first trip a friend of mine who does gamble a lot met a random guy ""Greg"" in the high-roller gaming area. I guess he was cool because my friends came to get me from the poker room to go meet this guy. He must've made quite an impression. Before I could cash out another random guy at the table, but we've been at this casino for so long at this point and hung out with so many random people that we didn't think much of it. Sidenote: Greg pays for EVERYTHING that night. Taxi/alcohol/strippers

After we return home, and possible room accommodations. Chris even gives me the phone number to reserve a room and tells me how to go through the automated system to make it easier for me. All pretty friendly stuff.

And then I get this feeling... I'm usually not a paranoid person at all, and they seem to ALWAYS be there (Greg has been there close to a month at this point). I feed into this paranoia and come to the conclusion that one, if not both, of these guys is working undercover for the casino. I accept this far-fetched idea and think its ingenious that the casino has implemented undercover employees to mingle with their guests and subtly get us to play more games, and advertise various shops and restaurants to us without our immediate knowledge. I think it's quite clever and am convinced that if these aren't undercover employees then well, they should hire some because that is a fuckin great idea.

Now..comes the part where I lose you guys if I haven't already. I can't believe I'm even trying to explain this. On our return trip we managed to get ourselves a comped suite. Score! The first night we ran around slot-hopping, two of my friends, and myself, while our other friend is getting busy with said hooker in the room.

And this is where the bizarre shit happens. We're all sitting there and all of a sudden I get really, yet intermittently. I can't concentrate on conversations and for some reason can only hear select words. My mind is racing and then I am overcome with paranoia. I don't quite know what the hell is going on at this point, physically. It's here I start honing in on select cue words from Greg. He keeps saying ""ride it out"".. ""ride it out"".. ""Almost there"".. All while talking about blackjack but everything he says pertains to what I am thinking and freaking out about in my head. At times he directly comments on thoughts I am having in my head and even does hand gestures to illustrate my thoughts. Yeah.. I'm freaking out... but.. I know I'm sober. No alcohol or drugs prior to this event.. This doesn't make sense.

I am now becoming hypersensitive to everything around me. Conversations, though I know to be very mild, is now overbearing and a strange, very prominent, buzzing/pulsating sound is in my ears. The more I focus in on this sound and the more I allow it to ""break"" me down, the louder a voice becomes that says, ""He's getting close."" Whenever I hear that voice I pull away my focus from the pulsating sound and try my very best to look normal in front of everyone while I am secretly very fucking confused. So I try to relax.. the whole time I'm focusing on my breathing and trying to calm myself down.

Now this is going on in waves.. the pulsating... the buzzing.. the comments.. the shivering..the voice that says ""he's getting close"" everytime I feed into what I try to tell myself are hallucinations.. but.. why am I hallucinating while just sitting here in a casino?

Then what feels like a bug hits me in the back. It's the same feeling you'd expect if a fairly large beetle flew and landed on your back. I reach my hand over my shoulder and grab at the spot and immediately feel it. It's moving... but it's under my shirt. How the fuck did it get under my shirt? Whatever, now you can get in there."" I freeze, look at him... and instantly feel something crawling around my neck. I slap my hand to the back of neck, only to feel SOMETHING crawl INTO the back of my neck. Ummm...yeah.. if I was freaking out before... then well you could say this made me lose my shit.

Even during this unexplainable thing I was going through I still managed to have some sense of humor. I remember thinking to myself

At some point immediately after this I saw a black blur quickly move from down the pathway by the slots, nothing. But I couldn't shake that feeling that someone was behind me. It's here that I heard Greg say something along the lines of, ""Go explore, it's your world now."" in a voice that was like he was disappointed. Maybe he was expecting a different result? Or maybe I wasn't supposed to be this aware of what was happening to me? Either way I felt something enter the back of my neck and just like that I felt like I was in a trance or some sort of hypnotic state. Although I've never been in one before, I imagine this is what it's like.

I don't really know much of what happened after the ""Go explore"" comment. But I remember having this overwhelming feeling that Greg was a part of this.. and even the casino itself was part of what was happening to me. The hooker eventually came back down and found us at the table. My friends got up and I followed them back to the room.

I was now terrified of being alone anywhere in this casino. My thoughts were noticeably more clear now that we left that table. It was only when I walked away that I noticed how clouded my thoughts and senses actually were. Very noticeably different.

Okay.. so now here I am. The days and weeks following this event have been filled with paranoia, daily. I also see something in my field of vision that I can guess is about the size of a fruitfly that appears, flys a small ""S"" curve, and disappears. Again, almost daily. It always happens very quickly and before I am able to focus in on it.

So, vision, hearing, and touch all while not giving off the impression of being a hallucination at any point. It’s all seamless and VERY real. These weren't warm colors, and geometric shapes melting and warping into loving hugs. This was a, ""I'm taking over your body and you can't do anything about it"" kind of experience.

I did some research on schizophrenia, my whole demeanor, and personality, and possibly my perception of reality have changed because of this…

We exited the highway and turned onto the street that led to his apartment. But as soon as we passed the traffic light under the highway, we both saw a mother effing werewolf type creature exit a neighborhood street, and calmly run (in about 4 steps) across a 4 lane road.  It was about 75 yards in front of us.  But it wasn't exactly the way I'd imagine a werewolf.  It was completely canine... no human features at all except for the fact that it was on 2 legs.  The legs were massive and the thing was about 7 feet tall but the arms reminded me of t-rex arms.  They were small and still hung like dog legs.  They seemed very useless if the thing were trying to attack something.  The head was also odd.  Besides being a typical dog color (greyish black) the eyes were bright glowing yellow... even when there weren't headlights shining directly in them.  It didn't look like the glow an animal gets from lights in their eyes anyway.  But the thing that stood out to me the most was that the eyes were biocular, like a fish.  I saw the eyes clearly even though he was completely profile to us.  Here is a pic I drew.  I couldn't quite get it right, it was a little more menacing in the head and face than I could convey.  But I couldn't figure out how to draw it without making it look over the top and cartoonish.

I'll never forget how fast this thing was either.  Here is a diagram of what happened.

More about what this thing looked like:  It was more menacing than my photo, I didn't get the sense that it cared that we saw it or that it was even trying that hard to cross before we got closer.  I didn't feel fear as if we were threatened, only a disbelief really.  And again, it's not like we were in a rural area by any stretch of the imagination.

Mum worked nights and my brother who is a few years older than me didn't get along very well with my dad at that time so I felt it was up to me to save him. I found him emptying packets of pills into a bowl one night and took him over to our next door neighbours pool (they were away) for a swim hoping he would cheer up. I was only a kid

The next time he tried it I didn't catch him in time and had to call an ambulance. They got him to the hospital

Things got worse and eventually mum decided she was going to leave him. He'd been acting strange

Dad had family in another country so he travelled to his sisters house overseas to try and sort himself out on her advice. Two weeks later he hung himself from the railing on a staircase.

In the time between when he died and the funeral (maybe a week

I remember thinking the dream was a way for me to cope

The morning of the funeral we saw his body. I'd never seen a dead body and it was horrible seeing my dad

Life carried on.

I grew up, gave up pot, met a girl and started a career.

About 5 years later I was visiting my brother and his wife. My brother and I don't talk about my dad much, we began sharing our memories of the days surrounding his death. I told them how I'd known with a certainty I can't describe that as I walked down our hallway and said goodbye to him before meeting my brother around the corner so we could drive to the women's refuge that I knew I would never see him again. I'd felt it in my bones.

My brother told me about a dream he had had after he'd been given the news. As he described it I felt the blood drain from my face. The same dirt road, skin yellow and head down. It wasn't until he was finished that I asked him for more detail and had him draw a rough picture. As far as I can tell he had a very similar dream to the one I had experienced during the time between his death and the funeral. The details were all there. He gave too detailed a description for it to be a coincidence.

I realise this might not be all that scary but it's something that I can't explain and among a lot of strange things that happened surrounding his death like friends being scared to stay over because our place was haunted

I'm a skeptic. I like to read about scary things but have trouble believing most of what I read. This dream was vivid. I can still recall it. I didn't tell anyone about it. Years later my brother recalls an incredibly similar dream with details that seem to particular to be a coincidence.

 A few months later, what's up?"" to find no one there. Now mind you I was in a locked back hallway and I ran up and down that hallway searching for the source of this voice and found nothing to explain it.

 Now most people dont realize how many suicides actually happen at malls but I know of 3 at my mall (one I found). There used to be a police substation on one of the porches. One day for what ever reason some african american dude shot himself in the head right next to the substation. While they were tearing down this substaition and building new stores, I found that the light had gone out in the hallway and it was pitchblack. Or so I thought. A figure started to come towards me that was even blacker than the hallway and the smell intensified. I actually ran back to the car waving my hands in the air and screaming.

 This one I think was the worst. You know how when you are in a well lit room and you look in a window at night? All you can see is your reflection right? Well we were having a blizzard and I was working by myself. I decided to go out for smoke. As I was walking out

 Most recent. I saw someone sitting in a massage chair after hours in the suicide area. Then I saw a kiosk chair move without making a sound. This is damn near impossible unless it is lifted off the ground. Later that night I had a nightmare about demon possession. Super scary. Anyway I hope I didn't ramble on... I'm usually just a lurker

I had just moved into a new area and it was quite remote.  Not totally in the middle of nowhere, quicker ways to get to his using the country roads that were dark, driving past empty fields, woodland areas and had no street lights on the road. 

One night I was at Dan’s and we had to go back to mine for some reason (I think I was staying the night at his and had forgotten something important).  Instead of taking the usual route, I agreed.

We started off driving and chatting, as it wasn’t like we were driving around the Himalayas, just rural Essex.  In hindsight, at some point along the way I took a left turn instead of a right, which made us venture further from the main road that lead to my house, and deeper into the country side.  The roads can get quite narrow and as we had gone the wrong way I was forced to drive down a pitch black road with a slight hill on each side – the road was only big enough for one car, to the point where if we opened the car windows we couldn’t have held our arms out straight on either side as we would have hit the banks.  This freaked me out, windy country roads and I was initially scared that another car would come along and we would get stuck.  Stupidly, like something had landed on it.  I slammed my breaks on and my boyfriend and I looked at each other, and he looked at me

The vision of the guy running was described as ‘faint’ because it wasn’t just a regular person.  I don’t really know how to describe it because although it was PITCH BLACK outside the car, it was almost a bit shimmery at the edges, but was definitely human form, even if it wasn’t human.  Whatever it was also managed to keep up with my car, which was quite a feat considering I was driving it like a monster truck because I was so scared.  There were no trees or anything around for a mile or two, so when we could see the guy running he would have just been running on grass, but there was something not quite right about it – The vibe I got was that it wasn’t a person but an entity  and it was all connected

I started reading everything I could get my hands on if it had anything to do with magic. Everything from new age energy working, candles, incense, and a few other small items. After I felt that I had the basics down it was time to begin.

I waited until it was the night of a full moon. Everyone in the house was asleep but me. I pulled out my secret cache of ritual tools, rearranged my room, and crawled into bed. Nothing happened that night.

One hallway of the nursing home was dedicated to people who were on medicaid. I worked the evening shift which ended about 10 or 11 pm I think. There were weird things that happened here and there but the epicenter of weirdness seemed to be room 132 in the medicaid hallway. The pipes in the bathroom made odd noises which wasn't too unusual but that was only the beginning. Every single person that ended up in that room seemed to go crazy or die within a few weeks.

There was one nice old lady whose name now escapes me. I think her family ended up running out of money and she was moved to room 132 in the medicaid hall. She was always super nice but within a few days of moving to room 132 she began to act really mean toward people or complain about really strange things.

I only worked that hallway occasionally but when I did I would have to turn the water off in the bathroom sink or shut the closet door repeatedly throughout my shift. One night I put this poor woman to bed and she seemed terrified of her room. I felt bad to leave her in there. Her call light came on a couple of hours later. I went in and asked her what was wrong. She asked me to lock the wheels on her wheelchair because it kept rolling back and forth. When I checked the wheels the brakes were on! This kind of freaked me out but my patients were sometimes a little senile or crazy. I pretended to lock the wheels and told her it wouldn't move anymore.

Later that night, the bathroom door was open, and the wheelchair was in a different place in the room than where I left it with the wheels still LOCKED! I was really flipping out at this point but trying to stay calm. I was the ONLY person in that hallway all night and the brakes on that wheelchair were tight! Also, this woman absolutely could not get up without my help. Even then it was a chore.

I got her changed as fast as could. This woke her up. She said she was having nightmares. I kept feeling like there was something standing by the curtains in her room staring me down. I didn't see a thing but I kept seeing movement out of the corner of my eye. I got out of there as quickly as I could but I felt really sorry for her. She was stuck in there! This person died a couple of weeks later and I left the job shortly thereafter.

Also, three in one week.

There were also a few positive experiences. A few people that passed went very peacefully and it was almost like you could feel them exit the room. One woman that was well-loved by all the nurse aides became very sick and was literally near death for an entire weekend. When she was conscious she would tell us not to worry about her because the man with the beard was taking care of her. When we asked her where this man was she said he sits on the window (the windows were low and had a ledge you could sit on). Maybe she was just delusional but every time I went in her room that weekend it seemed bright and peaceful

As for this one

So essentially, weekly, or monthly basis. When we first moved into the house it was the worst - my sister apparently chose the very worst room in the house for activity. At the time I was very jealous because at thirteen she got the high-ceilinged room with the mirrored doors on the closet and painted it (I kid you not) hot pink. I wanted her room until we started noticing the general weirdness in the house (see my past post). Her room, however, was the worst. Her alarm clock would fly across the room (this is all recounted from her, so I cannot personally vouch for this stuff, but she sounded terrified telling me). Dark shadows would move in the closet mirrors. She turned her bed so she would not be able to see the mirror at night. One night she woke up and looked to the foot of her bed to see, a girl in a white tank top and shorts

But these were the small things, slammed the door, and woke me up in a complete state. ""Please turn on music, please,"" she told me. I thought she had just had a minor incident and groaned at her - but she went and found my stereo in the back of my closet, plugged it in, and turned it on herself. She was *shaking*. I asked her if she had a nightmare and she shook her head. She refused to turn off the light, music on, ""What really happened that night?"" She looked at me soberly and said, the *truth* she told.

She said she woke up in the middle of the night and heard, so she kind of rolled towards her open bedroom door, hearing the distinct sound of a dog's paws on carpet running toward her room. Instead of heading for my open door, the noise came towards hers, and around the corner came this *thing*. 

The way she described it was as a girl, with dark black hair and some kind of white dress. Black eyes. But the nose was sniffing, sniffing the floor and the air into her room. The hands - the *paws* were of a dog. The thing came into her room on its hands or paws or whatever, the three toes and nails of an animal, sniffing and crawling towards her. She couldn't move, she said, or scream, sniffing all the while up and down each side of her. It was, and it was real and above her. Finally she had the strength to abruptly slide out of the bed from under where it crouched over her

When she told me this, it was eerie.

I remember I was in my room and saw the cat out in the hallway. As per usual, refusing to go near the edge of my bed. I called my sister in, now keeping a wary eye on the empty space on my floor where he was looking - it was probably an 8 foot by five foot space, with the only non-clothes-strewn carpet area being the one by my bed. My sister also agreed it wasn't normal, but I grabbed the cat and placed him at the edge of the bed so he would have to look at the space on the floor. Every part of his body twisted and strained as I set him down and he literally clawed his way back to the safety of the window. It was the response of a cat placed in front of a snarling wolf or something - I have no idea what he saw. After this bizarre behavior, he finally got up the cat nerve to walk to the edge of the bed and take the biggest leap I have ever seen - over that spot on the floor and directly to the doorway, where he sprinted out and eventually returned to stalk back and forth looking into my room. Needless to say I didn't sleep in my room that night. He has never acted in such a way before or since.

The strangest thing, they usually have heard one just like it. The same girl/dog thing, the same paralysis. The creepiest similar one I heard was of an army recruit in his barracks who saw the dog girl, and not a single person around him (maybe forty) woke up. We never meet the people who experienced this same phenomenon, but the stories are always terrifyingly similar. This is the part that scares me the most.

A few friends and I were in South America for a couple months and had decided beforehand to hike the Inca Trail. I'll fast forward to the third night here

On the third night, there used to a small mining village by the campsite we were staying at. One night, the Shining Path ripped through the area and massacred the town, executing a bunch of the villagers in the caves around the town.

At this point, telling us to follow them) that we should remember to stay put, and that the lights and voices were the spirits trying to trick us into getting lost in the jungle. He also told us that he had hikers that had been dragged out of their tents by their feet. I guess it was a sort of revenge against the interlopers sort of thing. 

That night, but I think I had only been asleep a few hours before everything started.

Our tents were pretty tiny two man jobs (built for Peruvians, a few hours into the night, the sounds started. You know the sound when something brushes against tent/windbreaker fabric? That sort of zippery sound? That was the first thing that woke me up. And it wasn't a fellow hiker, either. The campsite was set up on a three tier sort of embankment, and there was only a couple feet of space between the tent and the next tier below. I mention this because none of us would be able to traverse it without light without tripping on pegs/rope/etc. 

Soon after the sounds started, grabbing at our feet. You could feel it, even with our feet inside the sleeping bags.

Not wanting to look like a couple of pansies, say it was just a wild chicken or deer. Anything else. Finally, because our eyes couldn't stay open any longer, we crashed.

I don't know how long after this happened, but crazy different at the same time.

I woke up. My buddy was staring at me from across the tent. There was a soft light in the tent, sat up, and told me, ""Listen. You need to follow me. You need to come with me right now."" 

And then he reached over towards me as if to unzip my sleeping bag. I couldn't take it - I wrenched my head to the side, who is once again looking straight at me.

He told me that I had screamed in my sleep and woken him up

Eventually

I don't exactly know how i knew he died, I don't know if it was a dream I just knew that it had happened.

She had a recliner in her room and often sat in it and I could see her from my room. She would wave and I would wave back. Eventually she moved to California with my great uncle and aunt and passed away there. One night I was looking out my window and her recliner was turning in the room back and forth really slow and creepy like. Also, kind of around a corner. The attic door was also down that way and it was an old door with one of those latched handles. It made a distinct noise when it would open. Every once in a while we would hear that door latch open. It was also always very cold in that one spot, even on the most humid summers day in southern New Jersey. Whenever I stayed the night at my grandmoms we always slept in the living room, my grandmother always slept in a recliner and I would sleep on her couch. If I had to go to the bathroom I would always wake my grandmom up so she could point the flash light up the stairs so i could go. I was honestly scared of the second floor of that house. 

Next thing that happened was when I was about 9 or 10, and that he was there to make sure that I would stay safe. He said that Wesley sent him, which threw me because Wesley is my grandfather's name who had passed. He continued to tell me that I was going to be okay and such. And then all the sudden he was gone. 

After my grandmother moved out of the house, we looked all over that house for that checker piece and never found it. Things like that happened a lot there.

Other little things happened here and there through out my life. Another big thing was when I was 24 I had a really bad car accident, and even my friend who was in the car infront of me recalled seeing him there. But when I said something to the cop who was talking to me from the passenger side of the window told me there was no possible way someone would be able to talk to me from the driver side of the car because I was up against a guardrail that was blocking me from a steep embankment. There were no foot prints in the snow on that side either, he checked when they got me out of the car. I honestly think he had to be some kind of guardian angel.

 After my mom passed away and my son was born. my mom died in November of 2008 and my son was born in February of 2009. My dad still lived in the house that I grew up in, I figured he was hungry and started to walk towards the stairs when he just stopped. So finished what I was doing. Headed down stairs into the dinning room and saw my son had a binky in his mouth and passed out. The binky was in the baby bag on the table above him there was no way he could even get to it since he was 3 months old. The room smelled like lilacs which was my mom's favorite flowers. I figured she just was visiting.

And the last thing has to do with my daughter who is now 3 years old. One night she had fell asleep in her playroom while watching Cinderella. I left her in there while I was finishing laundry and putting towels away. I was in the kid's bathroom when all the sudden I hear her talking. She is laughing and chatting away. I hear her say things like ""Mommy tells me I look just like you"" ""Yes I promise to be good"" ""Oh I love you too granmom"" So I walk towards the room and she is sitting in the floor looking right at the couch like someone was sitting there. She pulled out a book turned back to the couch and started to cry. I walked in and asked her what was wrong and she said my grandmom left without saying bye!! I want hugs and kisses!! I said Ellie who were you talking to she said GRANMOM!! I told her to show me, she never met her.

1362429129.0,19npsa,[ME][FAM] I think my dad was followed by a possibly demonic entity.,vondahl,70,10,15,"My grandparents on my dad's side lived in a nice, and we've never suffered from hallucinations.

This happened when I was fairly young (6-8), and my father did not have a happy childhood. His parents never praised him or gave him any love and affection. I think that this negative energy in the house may have attracted a negative entity.

However, we had no choice but to use the one at the end of the hallway. 

When we would walk down the hallway, and the hairs on my neck would prickle.

Feeling threatened when no visible danger is eminent is unpleasant enough

We would oftentimes run down the hallway into the bathroom, I remember poking my head out and looking down the hallway, and seeing a man's dark silhouette pull his head back into one of the rooms, like he had been peeking at us and then didn't want us to see him. 

I've spent a lot of time trying to think of light sources and what it could've been, confirming that we both saw whatever that just was.

Seeing the silhouette peering out of rooms was all I ever saw, and then walked into one of the bedrooms. She said she at first felt threatened, but then she felt this incredible sadness and anger coming from the entity. She was young, but she definitely remembers this incident.

We tried telling my parents that we'd seen something weird in the hallway

I didn't find out until I was much older that my parents had seen it too. My sis and I were talking about it

My dad grew up in that house, he had to go to the bathroom badly in the middle of the night. Like us, he'd poke his head out and see a silhouette looking back at him, and then pulling its head back into another room. Mind you, this is nighttime so the entity was darker than the already dark hallway. 

What scared me more was that, he felt this enormous pressure on his ankles, like someone was pressing down on them and then the entire bed starting shaking violently. He said it eventually stopped, but he was too scared to move afterwards.

My dad started dating my mom when they were 18

They got married at 21 I think, she'd feel that same threatened feel and terror outside of their bedroom. 

This one summer afternoon, and it felt ice cold when she was warm just a second ago. She felt scared and endangered until she left the bedroom. 

She told me that the bad feelings in the apartment were on and off

On night, she said the room suddenly felt awful and she felt threatened. Then, there was the pressure on her ankles and the bed started shaking. She yelled at my dad and tried to wake him up, but he was out cold and she couldn't seen to break her ankles free. She yelled, ""GO AWAY!"" at the entity and the bed shaking stopped and the bad atmosphere left the room. 

She thought this was the last of it, she felt fine one second and then suddenly the room had an oppressive feel to it and she went from relaxed and happy, to terrified and hunted. She felt pressure on her ankles and the bed started shaking. 

Although she wasn't very religious, but the shaking stopped and she said that she never had any problems with this ""thing"" ever again. 

I don't know if my mom or dad saw it in the hallway years later when all four of us would visit the grandparents, but this made me wonder if there's a little more to life that we can't always see and explain. 

**TL;DR - Several times, a dark silhouette of a man in my grandparent's hallway. We've all felt really threatened and terrified, like we were being hunted and about to get killed. My parents have both respectively experienced (while wide awake and during day time hours) a pressure on their ankles in bed like they were being held down, and the entire bed shook violently. My mom yelled at it to leave her alone, and prayed aloud and she said she never was bothered by it since then.**",,False,t5_2sntx,True

Second I don't tell this story often because of how crazy it sounds to me when i say it out loud. I'll try an tell the story as quickly as i can but it may be a bit of a tale. 

So I'm about 13-14 years old and the one thing me and my father enjoy doing together is fishing and coon hunting. He coon hunted as a kid and sold the pelts for cash. It was kind of something I did just to spend time with my old man. We hunt a hand full of spots every fall/winter

My dads a bit of a story teller

TDB is a weird place

Its a little before midnight when we park the truck about 200 yds away from and let the dog out the back. Hutch our dog has always been a good hunter so we cheat a bit let him run then when we hear him bey drive up the T and turn right or left based where hes at. Hutch plops down of the tail gate and shoots into the wood and me and dad hop back in the truck waiting for the call. We crack open the mason jars of chilli we bring every trip and nothing but out parking lights on.

After about 10 minutes I hear Hutch howling and going ape shit. I open the door and stand up out the truck trying to hear where he is. Dad fires the truck up and plops the lights on. Now not a minute later i hear my dog growling and the sounds of what i know are him fighting with something. Right after that(I'm not sure how to explain this) and upright lets say man like figure about 6' walks across the head lights in front of us about 50 yds up. His eyes glowing yellow from what i assume is the Tapetum Lucidum in his eye. Then silence. No dog, just the sound of that old oil pump grinding away. 

I hop back in the truck and look at my dad. ""Did you see that?"" he shakes his head ""looked like a man with fur but i couldn't tell

I hop back out the truck and yell for the dog and dad turns off the lights on the truck. 

Now I'm not sure if the lights we saw were always there or we just didn't notice them till the truck lights flipped off. Above the tree line of the field in front of us were glowing orbs of light of different colors. Orange, light red about 25 in total. I sit back down and we just sit and stare at the lights for what seems an eternity. We drive closer up to the T before a single word is said.

The sky glows like you would see a city/large business in the distance. The orbs are just there fixed. They don't move or change color it reminds me of stadium lights in the middle of a forest. So we sit there and watch, ""Combines maybe doing a night harvest"" nope woods and the river, ""You sure there are no farms right there"" I'm sure.

We finally get hutch back to the truck and get him squared away. We watch the lights for another 15 or so minutes and head home. Watching them in our rear view mirrors as we turn around and drive out. We went back to the spot the next night without the dog and no lights. I hunted that spot 20 times before and many times since and have never seen them lights before or after. To this day I have no real explanation for the lights.

**TLDR: Went night hunting with my dad saw a large man like creature and some crazy lights both still unexplained.**

My dad said there was always an eerie feeling in the house, to the master bedroom.

My dad said this really creeped him out because he remembered working the crime scene of the wife’s suicide and knew that the spot where my brother stopped his bike was the exact spot where the wife had committed suicide.

1350044542.0,11d1ya,Request from /u/sammichmaker: my experiences and a close friend's experiences with using ouija boards. Please don't use them.,,85,27,23,"As requested. I'll keep things reasonably brief as I really would rather forget about this stuff. However

My friend is actually my mates mum. However during hard times in my own family she has taken me into her house

Laura is somewhat a very gifted woman when it comes to energies, as she says ""positive energies to help, heal and guide"". She is a very lovely lady. She shys away from the ' medium' side of things for many reasons one being that its very draining on her to have her "" 3rd eye"" open for long periods of time and also hard to manage the continuous bombardment of energies that enter through the 3rd eye, good or bad. Another reason, "" spirits always want something"". 

Laura has always been fairly sensible with her abilities and has had them from a young age. Her grandmother taught her how to channel her energies and how to do healings and reiki work. It was during her early 20s when her mates began to dabble in the more darker stuff like seances and ouija boards.

LAURA'S STORY 1:

One night, warned the others against it. She had a gut feeling something was not right. Not right at all. Not heeding her warnings, her friends decided to use the ouija board. Laura decided to stay, to at least be the "" guide"" and try to bathe everyone is positive energy or white light whilst this was going down. She still begged and pleaded the friends not to use the board and the dangers that could ensue. But friends being curious and a little drunk didn't listen.

Laura assured me that these friends were actually nice people, who also had a love for Japanese culture and samurai shit. Huge kimono collection and katana collection at his house. He was engaged to a nice girl Sarah, who he lived with. These two, with two others all used the board together.

As the board got more intense, despite Laura trying to take it off him. It got so bad he actually threatened to hit her if she tried. She decided enough was enough and left.

She received a phone call 2 hours later while she was at home. From the police. Claiming Sarah was dead. Laura was called into questioning. Laura told what went on and was released. 

Apparently after laura left, put down the sword mate etc. mark was trembling at this stage apparently and wouldn't respond. He then turned around and walked back down the hallway. After 30 seconds he came charging up the hallway and into the lounge where he pinned Sarah to the floor and stabbed her straight through the stomach in front of the other two. The other two booked it and called the police. The one thing they apparently kept saying was that a) mark wasn't himself and b) straight through the middle of his moments-ago jet black hair, was a huge white streak that went forehead to back. Mark had apparently aged about 20 years when he came charging up the hallway.

Mark got done for murder but during court proceedings couldn't even string a sentence together

The other two underwent years of therapy. Mark and Sarah's flat apparently burnt to the ground the day of Sarah's funeral. Nothing was left.


LAURA'S STORY 2:


During a healing she was present on with 5 others. This healing for for a young woman who had been fucking around with an ouija board. Laura was being a guide for this particular healing and so she stood behind this woman, Laura wanted someone else in control there too in case things got out of hand.

They are nearing the end of this healing when Laura claims she felt  heavy breathing on the back of neck and in her hair. The other guide healer apparently turned sheet white and told Laura to "" what ever you do

Apparently things got fairly hectic after that. Ornaments in the room fell off stuff and smashed

After the healing and telling what ever it was to leave, anger and pain beyond belief.

Right now I'm going to share an event that happened to our oldest sister

  My sister's husband was 12 years old when he lost his father to cancer. 23 years later, and checked the answering machine for missed calls. 
There was one message on the machine. They hit play

  It was his dead father, ""Hey, this is so-and-so, call me back."" And it wasn't just his father either, it was his father and his brother, just having a conversation together. For several minutes the message went on, they talked about nothing in particular, and then it ended in the middle of their chat. Needless to say

  The next day Kelsey went over to her mother-in-law's house for coffee. She told her about the message from the previous night, and the sound of a doorbell ringing that sounded nothing like the sound of her actual doorbell. 
Immediately after this discussion
As my sister says, and dropped to the floor.

  I think for the most part

**And just a clarification note:**
  
  The answering machine was a newer digital machine

**ALSO
  
  The house they lived in at this time was haunted. Both my sister and her husband would wake up in bed to see a little girl about 5 or 6 years old standing by their bedside or in the corner of their bedroom. Their bedroom was upstairs

1366898727.0,1d2znn,Why I stopped staying over at Katy's house [ME] [FR],judkin,63,6,4,"**I posted to this to /nosleep

My friend Katy told me that her house was haunted before I even set foot in the place. We were both 16/17. She spoke of footsteps at night

It was a decent-sized house, with four bedrooms and big rooms (UK redditors will recognise the type). Katy had a younger sister; the rest of the family had a policy of not talking about their resident ghost around the sister, for fear of upsetting her.

However Katy and both her parents had experienced strange events in the house, freezing cold, to hear heavy footsteps pacing slowly and deliberately around the bed in the master bedroom, before suddenly stopping. (She didn't open her eyes.)

As for the china ornaments: Katy had a lock on her bedroom door, unlocked her door and - you guessed it - found that the front leg had been snapped off the third china animal. That freaked her out some.

Katy told me these stories, when Katy's parents went away for the weekend and Katy asked me to stay over for the first time, I probably would have thought twice.

As it was, stare at a spot (not necessarily the same spot) or follow something unseen around the room, then bolt for the door. If the door was closed, the dog would scrabble at it or rush behind the sofa and curl up in a ball there, whimpering. Odd, yes - but hardly proof of a haunting.

So I stayed round and all was fine until the early hours of the morning. I was sleeping on a camp-bed on the floor, as they moved down the the hallway towards Katy's bedroom door, I could also hear the painted wooden floorboards squeaking and creaking underfoot. It must have been seconds; it felt like hours. Looking back, I am surprised that it didn't occur to me that it was a burglar and that I didn't holler for Katy to wake up. Instead, I was certain that it was ""the ghost"" and I was terrified of what would happen when it got to Katy's bedroom door. I froze, screwed my eyes up tightly, felt my heart beating like the clappers in my chest and waited as the footsteps got closer. They got to the door, back along the hallway. I couldn't get back to sleep (perhaps not surprising!) but I didn't hear the footsteps again.

In the morning, I can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been, living somewhere like that.

Katy insisted that I must have been imagining things and that there had been no footsteps. Or perhaps a window had been left open or loose and had been banging in the wind. We checked the windows around the house

I carried on visiting Katy's house in the weeks that followed and

Then one day in the summer, sunny day. Katy turned on the oven, put in two frozen vegetable kievs (ah, British vegetarian cuisine of times past - it all comes flooding back!) and we made a salad, then we went upstairs to her bedroom until the food was ready.

When we went back down for dinner, and turned it on again.

At that exact same moment, turned and the tap came on - again, at full force. Katy turned off the tap and the radio. It all happened very quickly.

""Come on, which had a washing machine and one of those wall-to-wall washing lines hung up. She made for this door and I followed. Katy pulled the door open and, as she stepped into the utility room, the indoor washing line suddenly fell from the ceiling as if it had been THROWN at her. She pulled it off her, shouted and swore some - and then everything was quiet. We went into the garden and smoked a couple of cigarettes until our dinner was ready.

After that I decided to stop staying at Katy's house overnight, but the rest of the family still live there and Katy said that peculiar things continue to happen from time to time.

Part 3 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b9skk/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

Once again, or questions. 

What happened the second night, Christian, and Collin. We took my car driving around after a party at around 2 am. I told them about how the previous night scared me, but I still wasn't truly scared yet. It's amazing how much we can put up with and not connect together when it's happening to us. I mentioned that a friend showed me an abandoned church about 45 minutes away one time. None of us were going to bed anytime soon, so we decided to go for it.

After driving for a little less than an hour, this church is atop a large hill in, virtually, the middle of nowhere. It's lit up from ground lights still for some reason. We pull up to the church, and there's a run down trailer in the field/parking lot right next to the church, and then there is nothing but fields and trees for about half a mile in any direction. We park the car and get out. It's now about 2:45 in the morning. We're in the middle of nowhere at a creepy church, and amusingly enough

We take the place in, and if we really strain our ears, we can hear what sounds like a voice here and there. The best way to describe this light is that of a bonfire, but shadows were flickering around it as though there was a pow wow going on and people were dancing around it. We could only see these things through trees, and that hill was higher than our own.. So we went to investigate.

We started walking away from the church to the other hill, and I was excited about it. I set it up so the church was directly behind all of my friends, but we were quite a ways away, so it didn't show up in the picture. We then climbed up another 1/4 of a mile to get to this hill.

When we reached the top of the hill we had just seen full of life and what looked like people moving about and voices, and that we hadn't heard anything since we started down the path that led directly there. We were telling jokes and calling each other pussies the whole time to keep from thinking about how each of us was actually kind of frightened, so we must have forgotten to listen for voices or people. There is nothing to be found there. Not even the remains of a fire or anything of the sort. So we take a roundabout way back to the church and go inside. It's nothing special, kind of creepy, and we go back outside after scaring each other a few times. Jared and I are at my car while the 3 other guys chase around a medium sized black dog they find (I should have realized black animals are not my thing at that point, but I didn't.) Jared and I are talking by my car, and he points something strange out. He mentions to me that there isn't a house very close by, but when we passed by it

We back out of our hidden parking spot on the far side of the church, but it doesn't move. I finally get within 20 feet of this dog, that looks about 20 -30 pounds, and realize.. it is the biggest rabbit I have ever seen in my whole life, and it's completely black. We make this realization and stop the car completely. Just then, as if it knew we had figured it out, this rabbit runs to the trailer. From there, as if wanting us to follow. Sean says that if we see a mutant rabbit beckoning us

The rabbit waits patiently for us to jog over until we're within 10 feet of it, the rabbit is honestly gone, and it has nowhere to go except a small patch of trees right behind the trailer. We investigate and find nothing around the area, but we're already by the trailer, so we check it out.

This trailer looks at least 20 years old. It's got bricks under it and the wheels are blocked, and fold it a bit, then stick it into the side of a combination lock at school, and you jiggle it, and it opens. I agree to try and open the lock.

I make the pick, and insert the pick. I work for no more than 10 seconds before I hear and feel a BANG on the inside of the door. I immediately jump off the step and leave the pick firmly planted in the lock. The guys don't know what happened, but I just said, ""something hit the door from the inside."" So we ran back to the car and left immediately. Back on the highway, we're going 55-60 MPH all the way home.

Ten minutes into the drive, and all they could do was bang on the sides to ask for help.."" And everyone goes silent. He's in my backseat and I'm looking back at him when suddenly Sean yells, ""DEER DEER DEER DEER DEER!""

Sure enough, they are not stunned by my lights, they're facing my car, either sitting or standing at attention, waiting for me to approach them, and none of them are ever scared of my car... Anyway, I swerve to avoid the deer in the middle of the right lane (my lane) of the two lane highway. I try to slam on the brake and swerve onto the shoulder of the highway, it RAN IN MY CAR'S DIRECTION. Like it wanted me to hit him (it was a him, I could have reached out and touched him. After that, creepy thrill we got out of the night.
TO BE CONTINUED IN PART 3

...Also, after I told him this story, ""we need to go back and see if the lock pick is still in the lock. To make this story even creepier, when we went back about 2 weeks after this happened, and the lock pick was gone, but the lock was still shut. I searched the ground thinking that maybe a 100 MPH gust of wind appeared out of nowhere and magically took the aluminum foil from inside the padlock, but it wasn't anywhere on the ground. Someone took it off the lock.

I won't say anything to sway your minds, cats, farm animals, and my family has a farm nearby. I know how animals act, and have almost run over a few deer in my time (it's an inevitability here.) But I want you to know, that these animals were not acting normal in case that wasn't clear. Sure, deer MIGHT run at your car the exact second you swerve in that direction, black cats might appear in your path twice

Ive been living in Brighton for about two years now so I'm more or less used to the area and the local happenings. I was walking up a very busy high street to go to the local shopping centre (a shopping mall essentially), shaved head with tattoos on it, sunglasses (it was quite a cloudy day) and a black raggedy blanket covering his legs. However different is normal in Brighton, so I just gathered it to being just another querky Brightonian and carried on past him.

However as I am just about to walk past him, but also because theres no way he could've seen me coming up as I didnt see him looking. So it was either he had an eleborate set of mirrors, or just a lucky guess (I guess he could've heard me coming but why me specifically, there were loads of people walking around him, who for some reason didn't take any notice of him).

I looked down at him

I wasnt really in a rush to get anywhere so I replied ""Y-Yeah sure"", thank you friend"" he then seemed to lean in and said ""we must always help others before we help ourselves"", I smiled and for some reason thanked him. As I began to walk away, I then turned back and to my disbelief he was gone. Which was ridiculously strange as I had only turned for a few seconds, not nearly enough time for him to move into a place where I couldnt see him. I slowly walked back to where Id left him and looked around,he was no where to be seen, I even looked inside of the church and he wasnt inside. I eventually just shrugged and carrried on about my business.

So yeah, but ya'know,I had no idea that was gonna happen.

people who might believe me. This particular post will involve my best friend Jeff
sure he is comfortable with the content. This isn't the first time I've encountered strange
later time.

The most interesting paranormal event concerning Jeff occured during the summer of 2011 while I was out of town. The majority of this even I heard about from Jeff and
had I not participated in two crucial parts I would not believe him. During that summer I was at an internship 1
on the phone quite often. He started telling me about hearing strange noises in his crawlspace above his garage
their refrigerator in there.) After weeks of hearing these noises he took it upon himself to climb up there and see what sort of animal had made said noises. He was on
the phone with me while he climbed up there. He told me at first that he didn't see anything
was a shout
curious than scared. 

This is his description of what he saw ""It was not quite human and not quite animal in shaped. This thing crawled on all fours like a human but was way too fast. It
was on the smaller side. Only about four feet tall if it were to stand up.""

I thought at first that he was pulling my leg but he kept assuring me that he was telling me the truth
garage for a bit and would call back the following evening. During the following weeks Jeff's past time of our conversations was sitting in the garage and staring up at
the crawlspace trying to get a reaction out of whatever was up there. He told me that it was still scratching around occassionally and made some strange gutteral noise
that sounded somewhere between a goat and a cow. He did eventually climb back up there but didn't see the thing though he did find some evidence of something being up
there. This is his description of what he found "" I found where something had been moving some things like boxes and insulation. Slightly into the crawspace I found a 
burnt old scrap of paper with a symbol on it. I had never seen the symbol before and the paper would later disappear without a trace. For along time before and after a wierd sulfer
smell would be coming from there. I checked there was no gas leak and nothing I could connect it to. It seem to just be in the same spot I found the paper.""

He also told me he would hear what sounded like something scratching inside the walls. He heard these noises when sitting in the living room which shared a wall
with the garage and went on to say that he heard the scratching come from the connecting wall. A couple months after this all started up
not reoccurred since.

I only had two personal encounters with this thing
night he was in his room but could hear it from the garage. So while we were on the phone he walked into the garage
space. I know Jeff did not make this noise because he was in mid-sentence when it cried out. He did it justice by saying it sounded like a combination of a goat and a
cow and something about the noise made my skin crawl even though it was over the phone. The other encounter occured while I was visiting home in the middle of my
internship
Jeff and I went in there to see what it was. Jeff was about to climb up when I grabbed a broom handle and pushed up against the panel of the crawl space. I pushed it up
2 or 3 inches before I felt pressure on the other side slam it down. Jeff tested the panel himself and couldn't budge it. We left it alone for the rest of the night.

We don't know what it was or what made it go away or what even made it appear in the first place. I understand that the way I presented this might be a bit dry but I just
wanted to state the bare facts without any embellishment. Jeff and I will answer any questions you have and I will tell you more of my experiences with and without Jeff

My mom sits at the foot of my bed and says ""honey, hooded figure come walking slowly by the door hunched over. She said she caught it as it was just passing the door. She yells ""Charles!, Charles! What are you doing!?"" (That's my uncles name). No response. At this point he had already been in bed for over an hour and has Parkinson's really bad and isn't the one to really mess around like that. She gets up still yelling his name and goes to their room. He's asleep snoring. It wasn't him. They are the only two in the house. She called my mom and told her the story and calmly says, ""I just saw death, it was here to warn me. To prepare me. I just know."" The next morning her sister was pronounced dead. To say the least I didn't get much sleep that night. Anyone else with similar experiences? ",,False,t5_2sntx,True

We came to a point where the pastor lead everyone in the affirmation of faith.   Suddenly in the middle I heard my grandfather's voice

We had both heard him clear and loud.  Neither my grandma nor my father heard it even though they were right next to us.

Several days ago, WV during the 60s. It's a film I've seen many times, and I actually first discovered the Mothman stories in a book called ""Creatures From UFOs"" that was in the library at the elementary school I grew up attending years ago.

There's a scene where the main character has a phone conversation with an Indrid Cold

So

Now

There's a user by the name of Indrid Cold responding to various users. So

[This](http://imgur.com/lyyIV) is the first bit of back and forth on the comments wall. From there, but I was still pretty skeptical. So then I asked him [what pet I had in my hand](http://imgur.com/s9dT5). [(My pet, Korra)](http://imgur.com/elyK7). This was his [response](http://imgur.com/sTByu). 

I couldn't ask anything else. Between everything I've read, it creeped me out. None of my personal info is online, and if it is, it is locked so that only friends can see it.

Maybe someone's fucking with me

I asked this user to [email](http://imgur.com/a/1ME8s#3) exactly what Indrid had sent them.

Not too sure what to think of it myself

As for my brother...I have not contacted him. Not that I wouldn't want to save him if there's indeed danger coming

I feel like I'm going crazy...are there any other Redditors out there who messaged Indrid

Being the youngest of five

Now I know this story sounds ridiculous. and yes, I heard a noise. Creepiest noise ever. (i should probably note that the bathroom is right next to the basement door)

I heard the sound of moaning. Like a zombie kind of moaning.  Seriously straight from a zombie movie kind of moaning.  I kept telling myself that this wasn't possible and I was just hearing things. Then I heard a slow foot step on the basements first step. then to the second

Then, crying hysterically at this point) and I can see halfway down the house from that point. I see my pomeranian dog in the kitchen barking and growling very aggressively at absolutely nothing. He was just standing there ready to pounce, following something with his eyes, growling like a wild animal(this dog never ever gets aggressive/growls etc)  Clearly he sees  and hates whatever is walking toward me. Quickly I had to decide whether to run and grab my dog or just run out. At this point the male moaning from the basement is almost at the door. I had no more time. I had to run outside without my dog. this made me cry even more cuz I was afraid they were going to hurt him. 

So there I was, in only my underwear.I was just sitting there crying hysterically at what I had just experienced. I no longer heard the noise from outside and my dog was not barking.  

My mom came home, freezing to death. She screamed ""What are you doing!?"" 

I said
Now of course, they all experienced something paranormal, perhaps worst than I ever experienced.

We went back inside and there was nothing. My dog was just chillin as if nothing happened. It was a relief but also left me very very confused at what just happened.

My dad lives on top of an old pub – in the northern part of Sydney, it was housing commission. We moved into the pub when I was about 13, back when my mum and dad were still together. From the moment we moved in things were never quite right. As a young person, I feel like I was really in tune with whatever was going on in the house – the noises and the feelings I used to get in there never really bothered me, but I was very aware of what was happening.
 
Something consistent about this house was that every night, and things were quiet and the staff had all left. I’d be drifting off to sleep and then…knock, knock, knock. I sometimes went into my parent’s room and made them come in when I heard the knocking – but for some reason it never used to happen when they came in, and by the time I went and got them, the knocking had stopped. They managed to convince me it was just ‘the pipes’, which never made sense to me
 
One day, the knocking started. It was just three straight knocks to begin with, and my friends freaked out immediately. I calmed them down, telling them “It’s just the pipes”, so once they’d calmed down, they decided to experiment. One of the girls knocked on the wall – that famous beat “knock knock knock knock knock” and then out of nowhere, almost immediately, and that leads to my next part of the story – investigating the knocking. 
A few days after the knocking incident I decided to speak to the hotel licensee, the licensee told me that no neighbours had lived in the next door apartment for over 10 years – it was simply the upstairs of the deli that was next door. This creeped me out big time. On top of the knocking, I had started to notice other things about the house as well. 
The only good way to explain the blueprint of this small apartment is to imagine the accommodation you would find if you stayed at a hotel. It’s a long corridor, I would sometimes hear a distinct marble sound rolling down the corridor, like someone is playing in the hallway. The first couple of times it happened I ignored it, but the marble sound became more frequent. This continued until I was in my late teens.
Throughout all these instances of noises and knocking
A friend and I were celebrating the end of school. We were 18, but both had commitments the next day, so we toddled on home about 11 o’clock and headed to bed. Lill and I both slept in the same bed and pretty much fell asleep straight away. 
The next thing I remember is waking up, wide awake next to me in bed. 
“Are you OK?” she asked, eyes wide.
“Sure
She gulped. “I can’t believe you didn’t wake up until now. I’ve been hearing things for an hour”.
“What kind of things?”
“Oh God
Just at that minute we both heard a tremendous bang at my bedroom door. Not at the front door
Lillian was a strong girl
“GET THE FUCK OUT. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE. LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. LEAVE!”
I was in shock. Terrified that something would happen and make the situation worse, expecting the worst, awaiting the storm after the calm.
A few seconds later, and then stopped. We sat back in relief, reflecting on the surreal situation that had just happened. 
The next morning, a whirlpool of newspapers, magazines and books cluttered the floors – pages ripped, magazines torn in a frenzy. Shaking, we picked up the mess and collated the torn shreds, binning them or putting them back into place. The house was cold, and dark. Lillian began telling me her version of what happened the night before.
She began by telling me she woke up to the sound of books being dropped, she saw a black figure walking into the room. She explained that the figure leant over me for a few seconds, right before I woke up.
I was sweating. What did this figure want? Why was it leaning over me? Why did it want me? I was terrified by the thought of what this thing wanted from me and decided right then and there I was not going to stay at the house anymore until my dad returned from overseas. 
Shortly after this incident, and invited them over to help with the situation. Under the influence of these friends (including Lillian, who was present on the night of the incident), we decided to conduct a séance. At 18, I really didn’t know much about what can happen during these Ouija board sessions, and now that I do, I can assure all of you I would never be involved in one again. This was a horrifying
One night, numbers and the words ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. We scattered them around the edge of our square table and placed a small glass in the middle that we would inevitably place our hands on in hope of it moving. We dimmed the lights, lit some candles, turned off everything electronic. And then we waited.
As the homeowner
No answer. We all looked at one another for answers
A minute went by and still no response. I was beginning to feel nervous by this point as I didn’t understand why the séance wasn’t working. I looked at Lillian, the candle in the middle of our table flickered, then blew out completely – like someone had just leant over and blown it out. Naturally, we all freaked out, but that was nothing compared to what followed.
All of a sudden Lillian started laughing, like a human that I could immediately identify, but it freaked us out none the less. Then they started to talk.
Lillian
We all placed our hands on the glass in hope of a response. After about 15 seconds, back to the bottom, and the top again. We sounded out the letters as they were touched. S – A – R – A.
“Sara”
Lillian continued. “How old are you Sara?” The glass beneath our fingertips moved in slow
Sara had obviously begun to gain confidence. We removed our fingers from the glass and watched in awe as it slid towards the ‘No’. It then moved toward the middle of the table. Lillian pressed forward. 
“Can you tell us who it was then?”
The glass made a quick turn from its usual timid movements and bolted toward the ‘No’ once again. We looked at one another with trepidation. Without questions or hesitation
 Without thinking
The glass made a slide towards the yes, to I, C and H. Before it could reach the A, Lillian said quietly: “Richard”.
A more confident glass moved towards the ‘Yes’
“Are you the person who was in my room last night?”
A short glide to the yes. 
“What do you want? Why are you here?”
A quick slide to the no. 
We glanced around at one another, do you like me?”
This next part gives me goosebumps.
The small glass we have on the table slid so sharply to the word ‘NO’ it slid completely off the table, deep thuds that were scarily similar to that of the night of the incident. In an attempt to calm us down, my other friend made us sink back into the chairs. We had to close the gate that we opened for the séance or things might never improve. I wanted to be back in my bed so bad, and so we had to finish what we started. 
Lillian grabbed my hand, while Lillian shouted “It’s time for you to go! It’s time for you to go!” over and over again. The candles began to go out one by one, I was crying my eyes out and then all of a sudden, after what seemed like 10 minutes – it stopped. We sat in darkness, silently weeping in fear.
Finally, the hatch the attic (which was right above our heads) had been opened. It was only slightly lifted off, pushed to the side. I lost my shit. Dean, one of the friends who was there at the time, reached up and put it back into place, but I never took it any further than that. There was no way I was going up there. 

So that’s my story. If you have any questions or want to know any more

 About six years ago I was dating my bestfriend's sister
Dad's house on the weekends with them. they ended up moving into a new house that the family owned for a 
long while. Any time I was invited over I would get a weird feeling to not want to go
even before I started dating his sister I was over at the old house all the time. Just something in my gut told me
not to go to the new house. After a couple times saying no
over

 The first couple times I stayed I had an uneasy feeling but nothing horrible
After that things got weird
as storage. during the nights I slept down there I was hearing voices at night and it would wake me up
a super heavy sleeper, to go 
off just to get me to wake up.so it usually takes a lot to wake me. But these voices were very quiet if you could
imagine less than a whisper
screaming to wake me up. At first I didn't remember what they were saying just noise. Then a couple weekends 
later I started hearing them ""less than a whisper"" my first name. I never told anybody because I didn't know what 
they would think.
    
 The last night I stayed in the basement was the worst. I had a horrid feeling in my gut that night going down 
stairs, I woke up 
eyes half open and immediately shut my eyes from fear. Above my bed
thing dangling from the ceiling looking down at me. I don't remember what it looked like because I was so scared. 

 That was it I had enough I ran up stairs and soon as I went through the doorway I heard a sharp blood 
curdling scream
woke everyone in the house. But nobody came out of their rooms


 That morning I asked if anybody heard the scream
Her step mom saw that I was obviously shaken up still and asked what was wrong
has been happening

 The step mom started crying at this point
they first moved in
she know it was passed onto me somehow. I asked her if she ever saw anything like I had
this point and said yes she in her words described a girl dangling from her feet from the ceiling with what looked 
like dried blood all over and as she described it a face that had a smile like a porcelain  clown doll. 


 About a week later their dad was forced, at which point they 
found out the dad's great grand father built the house for his wife using money that he acquired from pretty 
much killing his mother and taking all her savings. I never went back to that house again
grandpa has since sold it.

My cousin and I were going for a drive down a canyon, as we were driving, my cousin yelled, ""dude, what is that?!"" 
""what?""
""What the hell is that on the hill?! Is it a rock? Look, kicking up dust!""
""I don't-""
""Holy SHIT! That thing just took out a tree!""
Then I realized that he wasn't talking about the mountain ahead of us, but then it looked like a man running, and he ran into a tree and knocked it over, meanwhile, falling, himself. 

I immediately told him to turn around, now that I knew where to look, we both saw this tall figure, in regular caucasian-tan skin color. A group of trees obscured the view for a second and it was gone. The color was so light in contrast to the rest of the landscape that we were sure we would see it again, but could not. So, we stopped the car and jumped out, putting together that we had, seen the same 15 foot tall pale shape. When we got out, and we haven't seen it since.

1364261956.0,1b0ixw,My Family's Experience with Skinwalkers.  ,redheadedalex,63,7,29,"To start with

The first happened to my adopted uncle.  He was driving through the canyon area (they live in Blanding, but full of them nonetheless) at night and got that familiar feeling.  It was dark outside, but the moon illuminated the canyon and brush enough for him to see out of his side vision that something was running across the desert night.  He was in his 40's at the time, and a police officer, so a full-grown man.  He started singing/praying in Navajo and kept his eyes on the road in front of him.  But he was driving at least 55-60 MPH so the shape running through the desert was keeping pace with him despite his high speed.  He said that it looked vaguely human-shaped, but paler than any human he'd ever seen.  Still, he didn't look directly at it.  And despite his singing he was getting more and more scared.  One thing my Navajo family always taught me was that these creatures feed on your fear.  This one certainly seemed to.   My uncle was shaking and sweating when the running 'thing' picked up speed, and then when it was maybe thirty yards ahead of him, he sped up

So he saw it for the first time then.  He described it as a skinny man in jeans and a plaid shirt (typical res wear) with a long face and big yellow eyes that looked like cat eyes.  It's arms were thrown up over its head and its hands were kind of flying out behind it.  The worst part was that its mouth was open and seemed to be disconnected from its jaw


Another encounter happened to my adopted brother, which happens in a hogan.  The rule is that you never leave the hogan alone, because the magic and energy that you make during those ceremonies is kind of like a supernatural light beacon, and you never know what kind of creatures you're attracting.  Still, Eric, my brother, was a pretty rational guy and wasn't afraid of the dark.  He'd been in the hogan for hours, and he needed a smoke break and to take a leak.   So against the general rule, he walked away from the hogan, he saw it: under one of the vehicles

The creature didn't have the shape of any animal he recognized though; he explained it to me that it ""was shaped like Gollum, walked toward the vehicle and bent down to get a closer look.  Dust scrabbled around and he could hear a skittering noise.  One bony arm shoved some gravel his way and the next thing he knew, the creature was gone and the vechile was empty.  But then he smelled this disgusting, puke-worthy stench, and he got scared then, because that's one of the worst things in the Navajo culture....bad smells are treated very seriously (when they're assumed to be supernatural.)  

So he straightened back up and then he realized the source of the smell.  A shadow fell over him--covering him from behind--and he is around 6'2'' so this thing he said he estimated at 7.5 feet at least.  He was shivering and didn't move as it approached him from behind, see its shadow, and then the worst thing: he felt it breathe on his neck.  Eric said that it sounded like a horse or cow when it snorts, and its breath was warm.  When he looked at his feet, he saw his own shoes, and behind his right foot, a big hoof.

1362798674.0,19yaxk,[ME] Something from childhood.,Red1332,76,21,48,"I've actually had quite a few strange events from childhood

Now, but I wasn't really in to spooks and monsters and whatnot. I was a nerdy glasses-girl who just loved to read and hike.

We had been in our house a year or two with only a vague feeling of worry regarding the basement and my closet/under my bed crossing my mind

One evening, my brother across the hall from me and my parents in the bedroom next door. As we were settling in I heard something moving around downstairs. It sounded like something sliding around on the carpets. The dogs were upstairs so there was nothing to be making that noise. Anyway, I was sure if it was truly weird my parents or brother would say something, because it was very loud.

But as I settled in, as if it was having a hard time climbing the stairs.

Nobody was saying anything

""There's nothing on the stairs

""But I hear something coming up the stairs and it's thumping around!"" I told them.

They ignored me.

""I can hear it coming! Can you just check??"" I pleaded.

""GO TO SLEEP."" was the only reply.

At this point I was very scared because this thing was VERY loud

I heard the thing get to the top of the stairs and pause, one step at a time.

""MOM! I can hear it in the hallway now! It's coming down here!"" I hollered.

""GO TO SLEEP NOW!"" my mom hollered back. Then my brother added in ""Shut UP! You're getting me scared over your stupid story!""

And that's when I realized he couldn't hear it either

Realizing it had started walking again after I was done calling out, then came in to my bed, with something sliding along the carpet.

It sounded awful and wet and at this point I realized it was on level with me hiding in my bed

""MOM! IT'S IN HERE!!"" I hollered.

""ONE MORE WORD AND YOU'RE GROUNDED. Dad will come in there and spank the daylights out of you!"" (this was back before hitting kids was horribly taboo and frowned upon).

Thus threatened, feeling whatever the thing was staring at me through the sheet I had over my head for protection.

Finally

I so wish I had not. I so wish I'd let myself get stressed to the point of passing out.

Standing at eye level (my bed was on a riser and I had to climb up to get in to it) was something with no hair on it, purple, black and dark blue as of the entire body had been bruised and kicked about without an inch of flesh spared.

The face itself was just round, no eye sockets or anything. The mouth was lopsided, like a slash, and when it opened it (no lips, by the way, just the slash) there were a few grey, ground down and rounded teeth spaced out.

The worst part, though, was so horribly deformed that I don't even remember what the normal hand looked like. Its right hand was a huge, deformed lump of the same bruise-riddled skin with no fingers visible. It was so heavy it pulled the right shoulder of the thing down so the hand dragged on the ground. The lump itself was so large that it didn't have to lean that far, however. it was easily the size of a softball, dangling from an arm equivalent to that of a 5 year old child.

In fact, I immediately dismissed the idea.

After a moment I couldn't handle it so I scooted as far from the edge of the bed where the *thing* was and ended up touching the wall my bed was up against. I turned away from it

Between the stress of my heart pounding and sweating from all of the blankets in the late spring

I lived in fear for days that the thing would return

In my town there is a house on the corner of a street that has been abandoned for 15 or so years now. The previous owners left in the middle of the night and they've refused to sell the house. It's an old Victorian house that was once a beautiful blue color is now faded into a slate gray. Well

I never really questioned why the owners left. Hell

However

We pulled up into our driveway and she turned to me. She had the most serious look on her face and she said ""If I tell you this story

She was babysitting when she was 15-16 with her best friend Becky. They had babysat a lot of neighborhood kids and when they got a call from the family (she couldn't remember their last name but she thought it was Richards) they decided to babysit there. 

The Richards had two children

It was about 11:00 P.M. and both kids were upstairs fast asleep. My mom and Becky were watching movies (nothing scary as they are both chickens-more movies like Old Yeller and things of that sort.) Suddenly

They figured one of the kids had woken up and went to go check. When they got there

My mom and Becky ran and grabbed both the kids, all of the toys were picked up and nothing was wrong. They obviously didn't believe my mom or Becky.

After my husband and I married, we accepted.

Before moving in, but I gave it a go. Other than the usual antics (things being moved, the occasional tap on the shoulder, etc.), I was pretty confident the situation would work out.

One night around one month after we moved in

Just at that moment, we decided to leave the mess for the morning and went back to sleep.

The next morning I awoke to the horror that someone had been trying to break in to the house while we slept. The back door that led to the carport had one of those deadbolts that can be only be opened on both sides with a key. Since we did not have a key, had drilled out the deadbolt. We figure when the person finally opened the door, our unseen roommate knocked over the trash can, waking us up, and scaring off the burglar.

Several people

One maid, dressed in white, walking past her into an adjoining room.  When she turned to tell the girl we weren't open yet, the girl had vanished.

A large 3x4' painting in the dining room area had a tendency to lift up and off of the 2 large hooks it was hung on and end up in the middle of the floor.  This happened a half-dozen times before I removed the painting and tossed it into a storage room (I'm not fond of having to investigate loud crashing sounds in the middle of the night).

Once (and thankfully only once), not moving an inch, while it scraped it's way across the laminate countertop.  It traveled several feet before I finally jumped from my chair and snatched it off the counter, yelling out ""knock it off!"". 

This particular encounter happened a few weeks back.  It had been an extremely slow night and I'd been browsing on my laptop in the back office when I heard the front desk bell ring. We keep the lobby open 24hrs so it wasn't terribly unusual to still get a guest arriving at 3am.  It took me a few seconds to walk to the front but as I stepped out I was surprised to see the lobby was completely vacant.  Now, the lobby was completely silent.  Curious and confused, I walked back into the office and replayed the security footage to see if I could find out where the guest had gone.

His body could not regain the strength to make a come back and my dad's heart stopped. The doctors and nurses came much too late

That night, tilted up in bed was my Dad, smiling and asking me, ""What's wrong? Everything is okay. Trust me, everything is okay."" Apparently, a look of horror lay on my face as I also watched what appeared to be three demon-like beings take the life from him. That is how I interpreted it and somehow felt this was being communicated to me in this way. One had a tube down his throat and from his throat came (sorry this'll gross out some and I apologize) blood. I honestly forget where the tube led, but all I cared was they were draining my Dad of his blood and I couldn't get over what I was seeing. Another creature was pulling what looked like energy from the crown of his head. Another creature seemed to be simply overseeing the process from the corner of the room. My Dad appeared to be completely oblivious to it all....or was he? Maybe he knew, it was like he was trying to tell me

I knew I was having an Out of Body Experience and everything felt as real as if I were standing literally in the ER room with him. I watched him begin to shake uncontrollably and  I snapped back into my body when I tried to communicate back with him. I woke up from the Out of Body Experience being shaken by my mother who stood over me. A look of fear was on her face as she told me ""He's having seizures

I had the choice to go see him or not as it might be a traumatic thing to watch, but he was unconscious still. His body was shaking violently and I could not believe what I was seeing. 

Was I just in this same room, but it happened and for a while I did not know how to interpret it. To this day, I like to believe he was telling me that while everything looked and felt horrible that he was okay and was not afraid himself. However, I don't know if he was simply unaware of the horror that he was amidst. Certainly this all felt quite traumatic as I knew I was watching my Dad die before my eyes both literally and energetically. Had I seen what it looks like to die on the other side? 

Three days later we had the choice to let him go or not as he showed less and less signs of recovery/response to stimulus. Even if he had come out of his coma the doctors claimed he would be in a vegetable state. It was hours before he had his cardiac arrest that he signed papers stating that if such a thing were to occur that he did not want to be kept on life support. We decided to let him go and I felt that he was ready to go

That was in 2007. This is the first time I've told anyone about that night.

1364699134.0,1bc84d,Ten Years of Ghosts.,DeathAndTheGirl,63,13,19,"I apologize now

My mother and father had four children. The oldest, Danny, my sister, Sarah, and I. When my parents bought the house on 13th St, Mary was 7, making me about 12 months. 
The house was purchased by my parents in 1989 for 25grand. (This house was later estimated worth of aprox 90-100grand. First sign.)

Now, and was the first house built on that block. The entire neighborhood was farmland at the time. 

My sister Mary has told me that from the first day they moved in

She said her first memory of anything supernatural was shortly after moving in. She remembers sitting in the dining room, there was someone on the other line. Someone, who could speak to her, even though the phone was disconnected and in fact, no longer had any cords or wires attached. Someone who knew her name.

The next incident mentioned is a few months later. My brother had bunk beds, successful in pinching and bruising him. 

The small things started soon after and honestly, sometimes violently. Cupboards opening. Lights turning on or off. The typical activity. It became normal, in a gross way. 

Because I was so young, to use the bathroom and having to walk down the hall. When I passed my parent's room, I saw a girl. She stood in a night gown, and reached out her hand as if she was about to say something, but instead, turned around, and disappeared. 

I began a fear of what I said was a gorilla, watching me, but it never left. I often made Sarah sleep in the same bed as me.
I later learnt she hated this, head tilted so it could look at her. She was a big sister, so she'd brave walking by and getting in to protect me.

When we were a bit older, my brother took hers, and his old one was storage. 
Mary is terrified of spiders, there was none anywhere else in the house. My father even had the house professionally sprayed, but they came back to her room. She'd wake up, and there'd be about 7-8 spiders above her bed, on the ceiling. She'd go get me, and I would come squash them for her. Middle of the night if needed. 

My mother had the same fear of bats. Once a week, he assumed it was the same bat somehow getting back into the house. So he'd kill it.Again, a professional came out, but to no avail.

One event happened to my Uncle, and he house sat for my parents.He said he kept waking up to the sound of hooves going up and down the stairs. My uncle is a prison therapist. But to this day, he'll still say that those nights terrified him more than he has ever been.

I recall a small event, reading *The Babysitter's Club* in bed. I had impeccable timing to look up, just as I saw her bed move suddenly a few inches across the floor. A brief second later, she awoke with a yelp, because she felt something jump on top of her. She slept in my bed that night.

In our closet, and washed away. But every week, they reappeared. Different positions. But they were unmistakably that of children's. 

There are many small events I won't include, going up a flight of stairs, or heard angry,or sad, voices. Often objects would be moved, or lost entirely. But I assure you, something happened daily. Some small occurrence

The last alarming phenomena occurred in what became our last summer there. I remember this day so vividly. It was June, and Danny was getting his hair cut by Mom, also in the backyard. I decided, when our program ended, that I too, would like to go swimming. I went out the side door, to the deck that surrounded our pool.

When Mom and Danny had gone inside, (I still remember how pale she looked, her long brown curls floating in the water next to her.) And asked me the first question in what would arguably be the most horrifying hour of our young lives.

""Do you see the little girl in Mom and Dad's bedroom window?""

Sure enough, and reached near the ceiling. She appeared to be kneeling, and watching us. Only..she was sort of faded, like a mute watercolor. You could barely see the colours. She didn't seem solid. I knew instantly she was a ghost. I nodded that I did. 

For the next hour, point if I moved across the pool, or even wave back. I can still remember them. We saw no less than 50 different children. Each stayed for a brief moment, maybe 30 seconds or longer, before becoming someone else. In one case, I screamed for them to leave, and a boy began to sob, one girl pointed to the drive way moments before my father came home from work.

Eventually I pleaded, dismissed us. But when my father could see me sobbing and visibly had reached my young limit, he called everyone to the kitchen table. 

My parents had always told us it was our imagination. Our house wasn't haunted. But that day, had seen and heard things. My father said he would hear people talking when he was up at night, (the rest of us asleep) and he was using the bathroom on the main floor. They would jiggle the door handle, but he never could quite back out what they said. He'd see Shadow People in the corner of his eyes. He once awoke, from falling asleep in front of the tv. When he turned it off, he saw a man in a suit with all black eyes behind him.

They told us that the previous owner's confessed to performing seances in my parent's bedroom. When the husband found out this was the cause to their terrifying activity

Background Info: When I was in the 11th grade, my parents were in their early-mid 30s, and all of my grandparents were still alive, so there's no way any of this was our way of trying to cope with a relatives death. 

We had 4 dogs

We moved into an old traditional cabin-like home. Very sturdy, and the house was not visible from the road. 

[First Floor](http://i.imgur.com/J2qHb.png) and [Second Floor](http://i.imgur.com/wIDO9) layouts.

What Happened:

We'd been living there for about a month, turning 6 or 7). Before we left, we put all the dogs in the house and locked all three of the doors: the one that went out of my bedroom, the door to the screened-in porch off the kitchen, and the front door. The windows were always locked for safety precautions. On our way out, we flipped on the front porch light and closed the gate.

We left around 6 and got home around 9. The gate was still closed, we were immediately shocked. All of the dogs had gotten out of the house. My mom parks the car while my dad goes sprinting up the porch. I run around to the back of the house to make sure there wasn't another car, fearing we were being robbed.  

There wasn't anything there. I walked back around to the front to find my parents visibly shaken. My dad told me

My dad and I left my mom and the kids outside while we went and checked the house. Dad unlocked the door

It was evident that we hadn't been robbed. Mom's laptop was still sitting there on the table, and the whole freaking house smelled like piss. 

I went upstairs to check their bedrooms. When reaching into the nook to flip the light on

After turning the lights upstairs on

I'll never forget the scene outside. Every one of the dogs were on the ground, hyperventilating. 

My mind immediately jumped to dehydration

We got the dogs to calmed down, we just took everyone inside and everyone was sent off to bed.

The oldest and smallest dog, and because we'd moved in recently, I hadn't put any curtains on them. I kept the back-porch light on that night, still creeped out. In the middle of the night, Holly woke me up. I sat up to find her staring out the backdoor, breathing very heavily. I went to walk over and see if anything was actually out there, but when I got up

I'm a 23 year old male, feel free to scroll to where the bullet points start. I have no history of the house, nor do I know when it was built, but I do know it creeped me the hell out from time to time. The house faces west and when you walk in the front door there is a small foyer type hall way that has three paths. To the left, you will find the living room and dining room, following that same path will lead to the kitchen, then two bedrooms and a bathroom at the end. The kitchen and dining room are separated by a door that swings both ways. It is basically one long hall way with all the rooms connected and no doors separating them save for the kitchen and dining room.  Going straight ahead will lead you to the back yard. On the right were two more bedrooms and a bathroom at the end much like the left sans living room and kitchen. At the time

* One morning I'm coming out of the kitchen about to sit down to watch TV when I see my grandma's rocking chair rocking by itself. My grandma and I were the only ones home at the time. As a child I thought nothing of it and sat down anyway.

* Another morning, I know. 

* One summer night, if I remember correctly, measures roughly 36"" x 36"" and it was an old pane that didn't open very easily. It happened at least twice that night and my grandma told me to ignore it and go back to sleep. So I did. 

* The fourth and creepiest occurrence happened when in was in the backyard playing with snails in my granparents' garden. There is a small window in the bathroom at the end of the right path that faces said garden. I remember hearing a voice come from that window asking me to ""come here.""

I've always been able to ""hear"" and ""see"" stuff that usually isn't there. My first was when I was a baby, with my mom and my grandma, and I pointed to an empty corner of the room and said ""Who's that man?"", which of course freaked out my grandma and my mother haha. Like I said though, kids say the dumbest things so I don't count that one. 
The first ones that I do count, but it was consistent. Night after night the tapping over and over, it wasn't until one night in my curiosity, I thought I'd try something. I tapped on the window, ""Shake and a Haircut"", and the window tapped back twice, (two bits!). 
After that I think that I unlocked something, and I heard conversations downstairs, that were so soft that I couldn't understand. (Sounded like a dinner party going on downstairs, I liked to imagine a 1950s ball dance because of the disney haunted mansion room). None of that really bothered me that much though, just kept me a bit edgy. 
One night when I was 14, but the shadow man didn't disappear in the headlights like how normal shadows do, the shape of the man didn't even change. It was horrifying because it was this fully illuminated SHADOW that was in the shape of a man, yet it was blobby and distorted, like the shadow was TRYING to look like a man, but couldn't quite get it. Needless to say, this spooked the hell out of me, my grandma was really surprised at how shocked I was the rest of the night. I was interested in the paranormal though
So nothing happened for awhile, or snacks, I started seeing faces in the corner of my eye, in the windows. These distorted faces of people that looked angry, or mad at me. They weren't just flashes either, they remained in sight. All I would have to do was look back at where I thought I saw something, and BAM, I just figured I was getting cabin fever from being in too much
A year later, like someone is playing around running up and down, or running back to get something they forgot for school. But this running happened at 3 am, so it was pretty weird to say the least. Not hard steps either, sounded like someone had socks on or something. Strange.
In the same year, or whatever, all I know is that it was the same darker than dark as I've seen when I saw that shadow man. 
As of now, however I still get feelings of being watched or being ""not alone"" in my house. I haven't seen anything since, which is a good thing in my book.

I switched on the outside porch light and opened the inner door.  Before I could open the outer screen door, and the hair along her back started to stand up.  I looked where she was looking, and saw a white, billowy something that seemed to wave in the breeze.  I started to laugh at the dog, thinking it was just a plastic grocery bag caught on a bush.  Then my heart started to jump when I realized that (1) there was no breeze-it was dead still outside, and (2) there were no bushes in that particular area for anything to be caught on.

I quickly shut the inside door and locked it.  The dog continued to growl, and it was still there doing it's weird undulating, billowing movements.  It was a bright white, misty looking, about the size of a large cat.  It floated about five feet off the ground.

1369039983.0,1eon84,Creepy Encounter at Diamond Fork Hot Springs in Utah [Me],sweetsweetjayne,64,14,8,"I have been reading Reddit threads for a over a year now

Something almost identical happened to me at Diamond Fork hot springs 16 years ago. So identical

I always tell people that my Diamond Fork hot springs experience is the most terrified I've ever been in my life, that I haven't been back ... until two weeks ago, during daylight :). I've often wondered if it was all in my head, but after reading the story at the link above, I feel more validated that it wasn’t in my imagination.

I was going to BYU at the time and one of my classmates and I spontaneously decided to go hiking up to Diamond Fork hot springs around 1 a.m. The parking lot was full of about 15-20 cars when we got there and even though we were alone

But as soon as we left the parking lot that night and started up the main trail to the hot springs, that I’ve ever felt in my life. Every one of my senses was on full alert. The feeling got stronger as we went along. I was filled with a strong sense of how very, very alone we were and that we had done something stupid and we could be (or were in) some kind of danger. Like I said, I normally don’t think this way, so this level of terror was unusual for me. I had also been up to Diamond Fork hot springs before a couple times in the middle of the night, and I had not been scared (with bigger groups of friends, though). 

So as we were going along, keep going at a steady pace, and no matter what you do, don’t let on that you think something is following you, don’t talk about it.” What sucked is that my friend was having a bladder infection and we had to stop about three times for her to pee in the middle of the trail! Each time I was thinking, “HURRY HURRY HURRY” but on the outside just kept up a light, pleasant conversation which felt forced because I was literally shaking with terror. I did get up the courage to casually shine the flashlight down the path at one point while she was taking one of her potty breaks

At one point, I want to tell you something when we get to the hot springs,” and at one point, she said, “What was that?” We were silent for a few seconds, but I didn’t hear anything but the water sloshing in her bottle in her backpack, so I lightly said, it’s nothing, me trying to come up with meaningless, going down the way we’d come. The spell seemed to be broken and the thick feeling of being watched or followed went away as soon as they passed us. I didn’t feel like anything was following us anymore for the last 10 minutes of the hike.

When we got the hot springs, my friend asked me what I was going to tell her. I said I felt like we were being followed the entire way, and she said, “I did, too.” She then told me that she had heard footsteps following behind us on the path, switching from one side of the path to the other, about 15 yards behind us (not that she THOUGHT she’d heard footsteps, “What was that?” she said it was NOT the water sloshing in her bottle that she had heard, too. She said the feeling started for her as soon as we left the parking lot

We were definitely still feeling scared after our soak, perhaps waiting for us to separate and attack us … the hot springs are miles from nearby towns and known to have wild animals (including cougars) in the hills. But she pointed out that wild animals don’t break branches and usually move silently through the forest (you can’t hear footsteps). I thought it could have been some guy with bad intentions, but when I shone the flashlight down the path, there was no one there. The third option was that it was something not human; some evil spirit or presence or something (suggested by another person; my then-roommate). It was hard because it had characteristics that were a cross between something animal and something human (like an “animal with remarkable intelligence,” that the story at the link above mentioned). But because I hadn’t seen or heard any of the footsteps first-hand, and only my friend had, I felt like I had to always end my telling of the story with, it could have been all in my head.” After reading the linked story above, whatever it was. It is insane to me that they experienced something so remarkably similar.

1360684667.0,18drc2,[ME] The Burgundy Bus,strixus,62,13,11,"This story happened between Macon, along parts of I-16 and I-95. It was fully daylight the entire time this happened

So, and I've seen a lot of strange shit on the road. But this one is probably the weirdest worldly thing thing I've seen that I couldn't explain away with a bit of rational thought. It might not sound that weird, but I have chills thinking about it to this day, nearly 15 years later. 

I'd been visiting my then boyfriend (now husband) at his home just north of Atlanta, and traffic is quite light since it is in the middle of the day on a Thursday. In fact, once we are beyond Macon, we are the only car on the road.

Or so I thought, between a hundred to fifty car lengths back: a burgundy red tour bus. Let me pause and describe this bus, because this is important. It looks like a standard touring bus, the sort you charter for taking somewhere with a large group. But this bus is a deep, metallic burgundy (the paint had metal flake, oddly enough), and the windows are so darkly tinted you cannot see inside the bus. There are no markings on the bus

I remember commenting to my boyfriend about it, I remember thinking, but then go back to driving.

A bit further on, and, much to my surprise, so does the bus. I notice as I walk into the restroom that I can see inside the bus now, and there was no one in sight. I do my thing, come back out, note that there's still no one in the bus, and he comments on the bus

I pull out of the rest area

We keep driving. The bus is still behind us, of course). 

Eventually, this wasn't a big station, and I honestly didn't think it could have room for this bus. But the bus pulls into the lot, and sits. By the time I get out to put gas in, I can't see anyone driving the bus, or near it. I fill the tank, all the while watching the bus

The bus pulls out a bit behind us

We turn onto I-95. There's a bit more traffic at this point, until I turned off I-95 at Brunswick, GA. It did not follow me off that turn. 

To this day, either. There was just something wrong about it, about the lack of markings, or anything else. I've never seen a bus with windows tinted that dark, either, or that color red.

It's about a somewhat weird experience I had as a kid.

My family used to spend some days each summer at our cabin

As a young boy, so I grabbed every opportunity I could even though the lake was quite hard to catch anything in. Sometimes we would be in a boat on the lake, other times I just fished from land since I was not old enough to use the boat by myself.

This morning I was fishing from land, hook and worm.

I tried different places for my float and different depths for my bait. No bites.
As I was just about to give up

I turned my head and met the eyes of a boy of my height
His clothes looked like what was in fashion many years earlier, however, I hadn't seen before.

I thought ""well what the hell"" and did as he suggested, the float instantly disappeared, and I pulled a fish out of the water.

In amazement I turned my head to thank the boy

And any relative I think I would have recognised.
It might just have been an extremely talented fisher-boy

There were only 2 other groups of guests in the place. One was a Chinese woman and her mother, so each group had an entire enormous floor to itself.

At this point the four of us had been traveling together for 3 months in very cramped quarters. Rooms were only $4.50

I was dead asleep, so I rolled over and checked my watch. When I saw that it was 3:30am, chills ran down my arms and up the back of my neck, because there is no way anyone I was with would be awake at that time.

I bolted out of bed, ""Hello?""

The door abruptly stopped shaking. I stood there straining to hear footsteps over the blood pounding in my ears, sprinting past my door. After about 30 seconds, the sound of the children faded away.

I stood in the middle of the room completely clueless as to what to do next. Before this, so I decided the only thing for it was to sprint to my brother's room and find out if he had heard any of it, or if I was just dreaming.

I opened the door, but he didn't answer. We were pretty freaked out, so immediately we assumed he had been abducted by the ghost child army.

We went to the fourth guy's room, and our Khmer didn't extend past please, thank you, and 1-10, all the way on up to metaphysical horror, so we didn't get very far.

1363691659.0,1al4ot,"[FAM] Grandparents' experiences in a house that was used as a Masonic hall, a high school, and a roller skating rink",beatleape,59,10

My grandparents moved into this pretty spacious house after my mom graduated from high school in 1971.  The original part of the house had been built in the very early 1800s and many additions were put on the house as the years went by.  The additions to the house were always added onto the back of the structure, but each additional basement was narrower and smaller than the last.

After my grandparents moved in, the occurrences were small; my grandmother would take out the ""rubbish"" (as she called it) and would walk back to the house only to find herself locked out, even though she swore she left the door unlocked.  Pretty easily explainable things like that.  Soon, however, more noticeable and inexplicable things began to happen.  One time she said she set the table for dinner and then went back into the kitchen and came back and the table had been rearranged.  Another time my family was eating dinner and heard a mirror fall off the wall and crash (they said they heard the glass shatter) upstairs.  My grandmother asked my uncle and my mom to take a broom upstairs to clean it up, but when they got up there, the mirror had been placed neatly on a chair

This is where it gets really bizarre.  My mom and dad were already dating at the time

After my mom got married and my uncle joined the navy, etc.  She was down there for about five minutes and then ran up the stairs and told my grandmother, ""I'm not selling this house, there's spooks in the basement!"" She got into her car and drove off.  They had to find another real estate agent.

So those were the stories that my grandmother told me, my mom told me that right after my grandparents bought the house, a neighbor told my grandmother that the previous resident of the house was a depressed artist who hanged himself in the back basement.  That would explain the real estate agent's reaction to the cellar.  My mom also told me that the house had been used for different purposes over the years (a Masonic hall being one of them... I guess there was a large dome in the ceiling that had been covered up by a ""regular"" ceiling in the 1940s).  It was also used as an all-boy's high school until the Civil War broke out.  Most of the boys went off to war and only a handful of them returned.

My mom was doing genealogical research a few years ago and found out the creepiest fact of them all.  Apparently, I was thoroughly creeped out.

It was daytime and I was hanging out with some coworkers at their apartment in Sacramento. I was the youngest at 16, Greg and Aron. 

There were 7 of us in the spare room. A few sitting on the couch

When Aron came out of the bathroom he left the light on. He came back

We all got up to look. There was no window in the bathroom. The deadbolt of the front door of the apartment was locked. Windows were all shut. We checked outside and the sidewalk gate was closed and locked. Who WAS that?? We all described the same thing. A woman about my height with shoulder length dark blond hair

Greg admitted that earlier in the week

When he got back, my dads brother begged him to play street hockey in the lane way behind the houses. 

While playing with my uncle, walking away from where he was. He was walking rather quickly along the side of lane way. Being excited to see his friend, my dad called out to Frankie, ""FRANKIE! Wanna play some ball hockey?!"" No answer. Frankie continued to walk quickly away with his head down and then turned into his garage. That's when my dad lost sight of him.

Since it's true I thought I share it with you guys!

I like to think of myself as a pretty skeptical person. Someone who doesn’t claim every other, there have been times in my life, where logic and common sense just didn’t fit in.

In Sweden most people are atheists. We’re born in to the Christian church, confirmation, weddings and funerals.

This story takes place at my confirmation camp. I was about 15 years old, so I’ll just skip to the strange event that took place.

It was mid-day, which was quite nice after spending the last few days with people around you at all times. I was strolling, taking in that weird old smell that all old houses seems to have, and listening to the floorboards creak under my weight. It was all kind of peaceful.

To get to my room, since it was closed at all times, and my guess is that no one even cared. It was just an old door, in an old house.

Without even thinking about said door, suffocating voice, which cried out “Help! Help!”. While standing there and listening, the whole procedure did repeat itself. The banging, the begging. As a 15 year old boy, in a house filled with other 15 year old pranksters, I just shrugged it off. I assumed that a couple of my friends were behind that door, and with that I started to walk the stairs again. Half way up

With that I made my way back down the stairs. As I reached the door, and the banging and the raspy voice were constant, I grabbed the handle. The door was locked.

This is where I turned to logic. If this person was truly in need, he was banging on it, which meant that he was right by it. Satisfied with my conclusion, I finally made my way up the stairs.

As I passed the girls dorm, and some just jumping up and down. Naturally, as the gentleman I am I asked what’s wrong. Two of the girl start repeating a story that’s identical to what I just experienced, and this is where things actually started to get really weird. It turned out that unlike me, the girls actually took the banging and cries for help really seriously. In fact they panicked and started to pull the handle as soon as they heard the noises. The door was stuck, but they were not giving up. As they repeatedly were pulling the handle and pushing the door, it finally gave in. At that very moment, staring into a completely normal,False,

I'm about 20 years old now, spooky bridges, driving by abandoned houses. At one point we made our own Ouija board. Yeah I know this was  a really dumb idea, but at the very least we were smart about it and opened and closed it in the right ways, so as to not leave open a door. That's a whole nothing crazy night in itself if you guys are interested. 

So anyways, forest lined backroads. The best way to describe it would be to tell you to think of the raptor cage at the beginning of the orignal Jurassic Park, but make it about three times large and made of concrete and be attached to a huge concrete building with only one door and no windows.

Now to get to The Armory, this can be really creepy with three teenage guys in an older toyota camry. So we're driving there, swapping creepy stories to build the mood when we get close. We slow down to maybe 5-10 miles per hour and creep on by. This thing is lit by only one streetlight that seems to be getting power from nowhere, and barely casts enough light to reach the ground. So we scan it, get thoroughly creeped, and keep going towards where our backroad meets the highway, hoping to get out without incident. 

Nope. 

About a mile down the road, incase of another car or deer or something. When we round the corner we all stop talking and probably all stop breathing. 

In the left hand lane is a puddle, not running, the water perfectly still, and steam pouring off of it. Not a light steam like from a heat change, but steam like you would see come off of a really hot shower in the winter. 

Around this time of year

It hasn't rained in about two weeks. And this puddle is sitting perfectly still

Needless to say

Now two days later we've recovered and decided to go out and find more creepy stuff. This time we journey to a bridge, curiosity gets the best of us. So we decide to head back to see if our unexplained puddle is still there. 

Lo and behold, and it takes us a few moments to notice. 

The puddle is the same fucking size. No water loss can be seen. Now I don't have a degree in thermodynamics, my scientific mind logically leads to the conclusion that the puddle should be significantly smaller. So why is this one the same size? 

At this point we're completely stopped, no steam can be observed. It appears like any normal puddle. Now, after we've all taken note of this, I decide to be the first to put my fingertips in. 

The water is ice cold. Not like, the warm from the atmosphere actually caused steam to rise from them. It was as cold as a water I had just purchased from a local convenient store that had actual ice in it. Once again, we noped the fuck out. 

Now forward again another two days. We decide we're going to try and take some water, so the fact that this water was still there and still retained it's size goes beyond every kind of scientific fact I know about water, especially considering it's still getting to be about 95 on average during the day, in a relatively sunny area. So we know there is something not right about this water. 

Night comes, playing some Cudi and jamming along, because things may get creepy fast. We turn on the backroad, drive past the cemetery, creepy towards the bend in the road, and once we round the tree line we slam on our brakes. No water. The entire puddle is gone. No sign of it at all. No steam, no wet spot, because the highway is about four more miles ahead

Nope. 

About a mile or so down the road, but I let my curiosity get the best of me and say we should drive up to it, stop and look. He puts it on my side, and I open my door. It's a fresh deer skin, still warm and bloody. But it's almost perfectly intact. There's only one cut, perfectly centered down the underside. 

But all of the features are still attached. The antlers, the fucking eyes, even the fucking mouth is perfectly there. We had literally been this way no more than seven minutes ago, and we'd seen no cars come down after us. And there's no way a person could have skinned a deer this way anyways. This only increased the speed of us noping the fuck out. 

Definitely one of the more creepy experiences in my life.

1339263502.0,ute3i,My old House with pics xposted to nosleep,RavenSekhmet,60,13,29,"
This is my first story here and sorry if it’s not perfect but this is my story regarding my old house and odd experiences. I wrote a bit jumpy but it’s my thought process so bear with me. I think a little 
background should be in order first. 

The house is in West Chester, grandma and me. My father left when I was 5.

One of my first memories was when I was around 5/6 years old. I use to sleep in the bed with my grandmother and she would get up often during the night to go to the bathroom. Well one night I felt the bed rise up and creak as if she sat and stood up. I was awake at the time facing the opposite direction so started to turn and ask her to get me a glass of milk. I got half of the sentence out before I froze. At the window in the bedroom was a woman standing

Now the house was falling apart around this time. The bathtub was sinking into the floor and was unusable. Also we didn’t have heat so winter was hell. For showers I use to have to boil water and put half hot half cold in a jug. Four jugs would usually do the job of bathing and I would either go outside after midnight so no one would see me or in the basement which was a concrete floor and was caving in a few places so the water would drain.  There was also no toilet or outhouse so…. Yeah it was same basement or outside.  My mother was basically a dirty hoarder. She would eat and throw food and trash right onto the floor next to her. I would attempt to clean and so would my grandma but it was no use she would keep doing it. We had around 5 cats and 5 dogs and the dogs were pretty much trained to go outside but the cats were not. I remember my mom would just put newspaper down for them and it was horrible because she wouldn’t clean it up. This was how I grew up I felt it was wrong but at the time didn’t understand how horrible. It didn’t help my mom was extremely emotionally abusive and physical enough so I lived in fear. The house itself also had me in fear.

There would be night I would wake up to heavy footsteps walking up and down the hallway and stop at my door. This happened for a few years and I would be terrified. I knew my mom was at work (third shift) and I was in the same room with my f] grandma so I never knew what it was but knew it was bad. Even now I feel chills thinking about it because I knew whatever it was. Also there was a huge old mirror in the hallway I would have to pass after turning out the lights for the night. It was so old the glass had odd warping and stains but I was freaked out by it. Even now I have a fear of mirrors because in that old one I would see shadows of people.
Growing up in the house besides the horrible conditions I was always scared of the place. My grandmother got dementia when I was 7 and I took care of her till then up until I was 14

I am currently trying to sell the land because the house is condemned with my mom who I no longer speak to and the place was boarded up but my best friend visited it the other day and found it open. Here are the pics she took. One is the front stairs which are collapsing. The other is a pic of the outside back door wide open oddly. The wooden table is holding the door open my friend said but I have no clue where it’s from since I have never seen it before. The one looking down the stairs is the basement. You can still see water jugs used for bathing also on the left hand side the wall is collapsing that is actually where the bathroom is on the other side and where the bathtub is coming thorough. The last one is looking into my kitchen. Sadly it seems the clutter is plastic food bowls used to feed cats and empty cans and bags of food. It’s a good example of how my mother keeps things and sadly this is clean for her because the floor is actually visible… I assure you it would be fucking layers of trash. This picture also creeped out my friend she said she sees an outline of a person and I have showed it to a few people and they say they see images in the background. I would love to know what others might be seeing. Mainly in this pic. but any if you catch something I missed. Now when she took the kitchen pic she said nothing was on the wall or room when the camera went off. She really wanted to go further but was alone and felt scared. The house currently is abandoned to my knowledge so no idea why its opened up.
One last tidbit my friend who took the pics last week was also who helped me get out of the house. We have known each other since 1st grade and when I was 18 saw it for the first time; afterwards she would have horrible nightmares for months after.
Sorry again if I droned on just this is my first time getting It all out so thanks all for reading  Any questions you might have please ask and remember let me know if you see anything odd in the pics.

1331667207.0,quyuy,"New Mod, New Direction, and a stronger community.",MrMagpie,56,34

I am the new Mod for /r/thetruthishere. Now, maybe you shouldn't. But I won't just be another name on the sidebar there -&gt; Not only do I really love (hate) these stories, I also feel a certain attachment to this little subreddit. I am pretty much always on it. And I’ve also had my share of messed up experiences which I have shared before, then deleted. I'm working on posting 'em again.  I, like many of you here, first arrived after /r/nosleep took a turn for the worst. I was there since the beginning of the subreddit, and I watched it become something amazing

We're not an /r/nosleep spin-off. Believe it or not

The most chilling part of this subreddit is, why is that? Because that's real life. Life isn't flashy, it's not like the movies. Life is dirty, shameful, ugly, cold, and boring. Life is understated. Life is our ""default state"", you can tell.

I know we aren't entirely immune to ""false stories, being respectful. I love this small community of skeptics who believe, or people who have seen so many ghosts by now that they consider it second nature. I see this and recognize it for what it is: a great opportunity.

Lets grow this subreddit. **My goal for this subreddit is to create a safe haven for people with real stories**. We know ghosts don't pick the most exciting, and how it makes you feel when you share a trauma and are met with cold, unbelieving looks. We get it. I get it. I am one of you.

So, a small subreddit with a tight community, and extremely entertaining posts. I want us to be a gem you find and spend hours reading. We are kinda like that. It just needs some polish. 

So here are my ideas:

- **Crossposts are encouraged.** I know you have probably figured it out by now, you feel belong here. If the stories belong to you, crosspost them yourself. If they were posted by someone else, feel free to ask them to post it. I have done it before, and as long as you are polite about it and explain yourself, it works. That is one way to grow our subreddit. We don't mind being an archive for real, chilling stories. I have other ways of bringing original content here. 

I need you guys for this next part: We should start crossposting all the humongous, in the comments, we can discuss our favorite stories, or point out buried gems. Those posts exceed the thousands of comments. Point out any good ones we may have missed. Here's an example of such a thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bhbyx/reddit_what_is_your_creepiest_most_unnerving/

Which brings me to my next point

- **How do I contribute new, some of you have already done it, or thought about doing it but haven't. **Ask**. Ask your mom, ask your dad, your uncles, grandmas, teachers, come back here and share it. You may use the **FAM/FR** tag, but it will help everyone know just how much this works. This idea has me pretty excited. If at least a few of you go out and do this, just give it a shot! This is your chance to not only get your own creepy story

Now

- **Why are you guys so afraid of asking questions?** We are sitting on a PILE of true stories with messed up implications. Together they paint a picture of a world much different than what most people perceive. I know you guys are curious, but many things make us curious, and we'd appreciate your answer. Plus its a shame to see an amazing story with few comments. But only you can change that.

We are a small subreddit. **Your votes make a difference.** The difference between a story with 1 upvote and one with 5 is that one story's OP can at least know his/her story was appreciated. If you read a story and like it, it's discouraging to relive your traumas, post a story, and get absolutely nothing but a couple of upvotes. If you upvote, comment, show interest, they will maybe share any other stories they have

/r/nosleep grew by word of mouth. That is the only way I'd like us to grow. Spread the word, here we have a collection of stories by people who have experienced these rare events. This is just about the best place to satisfy your curiosity for these ""things"". I would like to make sure it stays that way. But we can only do it with your help.

**Everyone likes the truth. Especially when it comes to this. No bull allowed here. Just the undiluted

Now

**If you wish to make any suggestions

**EDIT:** BUT WAIT, just now in fact, that we can maybe have some ranks for frequent contributors? And/or a special tag for people who participate in the ""homework"" project? I would need your opinion on this. Please chime in!

Here's what **Voodomoocow [M]** has to say about flair. What do you think?

Disclaimer: The following is pretty mild compared to other reports here.

I was with my girlfriend in the Liberities in Dublin, sat down, and I two minutes later had to piss. The toilets were downstairs basement level, as many small Dublin pubs are.

 This is hard to write, and began pissing. Bear in mind that this was a small Dublin pub, and the toilets reflected that - I was maybe four foot away from the door. As I was pissing, the door moved almost imperceptibly, and I of course took no notice - draughts etc etc. I was looking down at myself, as you do, when I became aware that someone was in the room with me. I, was acutely aware that someone/something was right next to me. This all happened in seconds as I finished pissing. I looked to my right and not two feet away from me was - I don't know how to describe it. A black, I will swear this is true. Every hair on my body stood up, and I swear to you that what happened that day struck me to my very core

I have since given more credence to others' stories

This happened a really long time ago, sister and I would already be eating supper. 

So, door opening, feet shuffling on the mat, tired 'hello!', and footsteps up the hall. All three of us shouted 'hello!' back to him.

I'd remembered that I'd gotten a good grade in school, and so I got to his room but he wasn't there. I was confused, so I checked the living room. Nothing. Shouted and shouted. Nothing. 

Went back to my sister and my mum and told them I couldn't find him. Mum thought he might have gone to the attic or something

About 10 minutes later, feet shuffling on the mat, tired 'hello!', and footsteps up the hall. The three of us stare at each other, really confused. When he gets to the table we ask him why he'd just come into the house twice. He had no idea what we were talking about, he'd literally just come home. The three of us had heard him come home already 10 minutes earlier and had shouted 'hello' to him. We've been confused about this ever since.

1364034113.0,1aupyn,[ME][FAM][FR] Weird occurences in the house I grew up in,renwickveleros,59,11,14,"This is my first post to Reddit so bear with me if there are formatting problems or something. First I'll just give some background. I grew up in a suburb of Cleveland

 The only weird thing about the house were some weird windows and ""peep holes"" in certain locations that were odd. For example there was a hidden window in built in book case that looked into the garage. I asked my mom about this and she told me that the previous owner was somewhat paranoid and would use the windows to check on her kids when they were outside playing.

Growing up there everyone in my family had weird experiences there. I can tell you mine and my sisters. Whenever I ask my brother he says ""I don't even want to talk about it and gets pretty upset."" I'm pretty skeptical about supernatural things and always look for a natural explanation but some of the stuff that happened defied anything I can explain.

I can't remeber a lot of things in my early childhood but I remeber being scared of being upstairs in my bedroom and scared to go in the basement...but that happens with lots of little kids. The first distinct weird experience that I had happened around age 13 or so. I was sitting alone at home reading a book and the doorbell started ringing. Nobody was at any of the doors but what was weirder than that was that the house didn't have a doorbell. If we did I could chalk it up to faulty wiring and be done with it.

The next weird thing that happened occured when I was around 16 or so. There were two bathrooms in the house as well as a stand alone shower in the basement. With three teenage kids in the house the bathrooms were almost always occupied at inconvenient times (before school

My sister also refused to sleep in her bedroom at night. She said that shadow people would surround her bed and watch her sleep. Her room was the biggest one in the house so I ended up switching rooms with her to get it. I never saw anything in there however.

The next few experiences are where it gets bizarre. I was hanging out with one of my friends and my girlfriend. We were around 16-17 at the time. We decided to play around with a Ouija board. I know about the ideomotor effect and I don't really believe  in them much. I was using the board with my girlfriend and the board spelled out that it was ""Nelly Gale who had died in a fire.""  My girlfriend said ""Screw you stop pushing it around"". I told her I wasn't  and she said ""Oh yeah if you're real then do something. At exactly that moment an ironing board flew from one side of the room to the other and crashed into the wall.

I saved the weirdest one for last. I was hanging out with a female friend and a male friend of mine in my brothers room. The female friend was kind of into new age stuff and nonsense like that. Somehow the topic of ghosts came up. She was saying that there are cold spots in my house and that means that people died there or something. I became upset and told her she was an idiot and it just meant we had a drafty house.  

Then my female friend looked at me really weird and said ""Whoa, I'm telling the truth. I'm going to touch it"".

The moment he reached out to touch whatever it was all of us heard the most awful sound coming from the air vents in the house. It sounded  like men and women screaming in pain

Needless to say my friends wanted to go home but my male friend was diabetic and had left his diabetes supplies in my room so we had to go back and get them. We went back inside and went upstairs. All the lights were off and my friend went in and grabbed his supplies. I couldn't see anything in there. All of a sudden he rushes out of the room and pushes me down the hallway saying ""Run!"". 

When we got back outside he said that there was something in the room with him that attacked him. He said he couldn't see what it was because it was completely black and it was dark.* He showed me his hand and he had bite marks on it. There were two rows of teeth marks. The first looked like human teeth  marks and the second looked like little ""needle like"" teeth marks. THey were deep enough to draw blood. Then he lifted up his shirt and on his back there were scratch marks that looked like they were made by something with three talons.

I drove him home and he was very tense and quiet. Later he told me that on the drive home he had the strange urge to strangle me and drive the car off the road into a tree. He said that he thinks being bitten by that thing made him have those thoughts.

I don't know what to make of all that but I swear it's true and witnessed by many people. There are other weird occurances there and the place always had a weird feeling to it but nothing else like this stuff ever happened again.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks for reading.

TLDR- I grew up in a weird house where there were voices and things getting thrown around. Something attacked and bit my friend.

1360317202.0,184hsg,[ME] Impossible hallway that broke my understanding of spacial logic,Nebuchadnezzer12,55,10,10,"I was going to post this story on r/nosleep
 
Back when I was a sophmore in highschool (2005-2006), “the old main”. The building was built in the 1930's, I believe, and was legally condemned while I was attending school there. The year this took place happened to be the last year there were any students allowed in the building. So yes, this was an old building at an even older school (opened in the 1910's), and this highschool had legends of ghosts, as any old school does, a girl fell down a long set of stairs, there was nothing particularly odd or creepy about the building. 

So... during a normal class period, I noticed that it was connected to a long, tile-floored, hallway. Not knowing this room was there, and thinking I'd never see it again, I wandered in. I felt uneasy the moment my foot went from the carpet to the tile. The only window was an old skylight, so everything in it was a cold, hue. This hallway was taller than the rest of the rooms on this floor of the building; guessing by the skylight

After class, and as I rounded the corner of the building it occurred to me that I should see what this hallway looked like from the outside. 
It wasn't there. Where it should have been was just air. I could see in the windows of the last classroom on the hallway, would have been impossible to see. These two buildings shared an interior wall and formed a rough “L” shape. This bizarre hallway would have been in the interior 90 degree angle of the “L”.

I am sure that the windows on the adjoining building (the district office at the time and the original building of the school), in choir, would walk down it to sing at the yearly holiday district staff party. The hallway I had been in earlier had no pictures.

I've explained this room to other classmates, and I always avoid being close to where this hallway should be; it just creeps me out too much.

This took place several years ago

There were three floors we used, nothing to top what I’m about to tell you.  Of all the teachers, very few including myself would go into the basement alone.  But sometimes we had to go because the big industrial kitchen came in very handy, even though it was creepy as all fuck.  Think like, the kitchen from the Shining or the Jurassic Park raptor scene.  

I had just celebrated Chinese New Year that day with the class and we had an awesome time eating rice, etc.  The downside was a mountainous stack of dishes that needed an industrial-sized sink to wash.  I waited until the center closed (six pm) and then took the dishes down to the basement.  I had one of those wheely cart things that waiters use, to make the multiple stacks of bowls and cups easier to carry in one go.  Commence Teacher Cleanup.  The ballroom lights were off and I didn’t bother with turning them on because hey, I’m not a pussy.

The water was running, and she was whispering excitedly, like when you whisper so fast your voice goes up and down and almost isn’t a whisper at times.  It sounded like she was outside in the ballroom.  

So

Whispering stopped.  

I started washing dishes faster, as it was distinctly one voice.  This weird image popped in my head of a woman in victorian dress and hat sitting there whispering.  I was freaking myself out.  So I paused again and yelled out super loud, “GO AWAYYYY!”

Whispering stopped.

And then it started again, and I heart soft footfalls on the carpet.  The floor of the ballroom is hollow so even the tiniest steps go with an echo.  The footsteps and whispers were crossing the ballroom floor and coming toward the kitchen.  

The thing is, because I find them fascinating.  I am not afraid of the dark either, or being alone.  Up until this point I had only halfway considered that this might be something not human, but then this strange primal fear suddenly hit me.  It was like my instincts were screaming YOU NEED TO GET OUT, NOW.  I’ve rarely felt that fear in my life and only one other time, so strongly.  I immediately listened and grabbed the waiting cart and busted through the double doors. I couldn’t even look in the direction of that corner.  Not that it would have helped probably, basements tend to be dark as fuck when there’s no light on.  I just made a beeline left, and the worst part: I could hear the footsteps and whispers change direction.  They had been moving toward the kitchen
 
Now the noises were fading: they were still audible but lowering in volume, but we had always considered that “the ghost” and nobody paid it any attention anymore.  

I did go back down to the basement alone after that, but this is the end of this story.  ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,

1360110293.0,17ytnj,[FAM] Almost lost my Dad,paladinprincess,55,6,6,"First post on reddit! This was a year and a half ago.  Background: My Dad has been diabetic for years and his condition has been getting worse and worse. He lost his eyesight when he was 39 and then at 41 he could barely walk without assistance.

One night my sister went to say goodnight to him in his bed and found him frothing at the mouth and unresponsive.  She called 911 and then me.  I was at school (I usually stayed until 11PM) and rushed straight to the hospital to meet them.  My Dad was conscious when I got there but still confused at how he got to the hospital.  

When we were alone he told me what had happened to him

It was a normal night with my siblings in their rooms and my Dad in the living room listening to the news.  He said that the sound of the news started to sound like a buzz and he was aware that he wasn't alone in the living room.  He called out to my brother and sister but they didn't answer.

Then he realized he wasn't blind anymore.  He could see everything in the living room and it looked the same as when we first moved in years ago.  He looked for what was in the room with him and saw it:  a great black shape breathing hard and moving from the kitchen and into the living room straight for him.  His legs were the same so every attempt to lift himself off the couch was useless.

He remembered a sharp

When he thought he had lost all hope he suddenly found that he could breathe again.  He looked up and between him and the black shape was his mom.  She died of cancer 15 years ago.  He said she pulled him up by his shoulder and shoved him towards his bedroom. Told him to go and that it wasn't his time yet.  She said how much she loved him and that she was crying.

Next thing he knew he was being pushed into the hospital on a stretcher.

The doctors told us his body had gone into shock from kidney failure and it was a miracle he wasn't dead.  He had been steadily gaining weight over the past few weeks and we seriously thought it was because of his eating habits and inactivity.  Turns out he needed to start dialysis that night.

1359780951.0,17qmse,[ME] Something that happened in 6th grade,Zander327,54,9,11,"First I would like to say that I just found this subreddit tonight. After reading some of these posts

I was in my 7th period class in 6th grade (last class of the day) and I had left one of my books under my desk in my 6th period class. I had asked my teacher if I could leave the class a few minutes early to run and grab the book so that I wouldn't be late to get on my bus. 

The class room my book was in was located in another building across a large courtyard with a covered central walkway. It was a few minutes before the bell, they were all over the place. Some were blowing in the wind. Some were on the ground. I looked down at a few of them, they all had the name Darius on them and were saying different things about this person. I don't have any real relevance for that name other than a cartoon I remember from a long time ago that I never watched. 

The court yard was mostly empty. I remembered seeing one of my friends out there. There was also a girl walking by that I knew. She said something to me while she was walking by but I wasn't paying attention to her and honestly do not remember what she said to me.

I'm an extremely skeptical person

When I came back out of the building, students were everywhere but there was not a SINGLE piece of paper. My friend that had been in the courtyard was nearby and I asked him what happened to all of the paper. He said ""What paper?""

I went and got on my bus and didn't talk the rest of the day. This is the only way I know it wasn't a dream. I remember how the rest of that day was for me. It's just so weird. It isn't even a ghost story. Just tons of paper that shouldn't be there

 I wish I had kept one of the pieces of paper as proof. But the appearance of the paper was not so startling as the disappearance of it. I remember being confused as hell the rest of the day. I have no idea what happened that day. It makes no sense. There was no purpose. But I know it happened and I will never be able to explain what the hell even happened or why.

Two parents offer 18 year-old Jane the chance to babysit. Jane jumps at the chance, suburban home in a well-respected neighborhood.


Jane shows up at 7:00 and sends the parents off on their date. The girls play some and are then sent to bed. Their separate bedrooms are upstairs, and watches some TV.


**8:00pm.** - The lights in the living room turn off. Jane looks behind her at the switches on the wall


**8:10pm.** - The lights go off again. This time


**8:20pm.** - She goes to the kitchen for a drink. She notices the lights for the backyard are on. Jane knows they were off when the parents left


**8:25pm.** -  Jane feels watched, and positions herself on a corner of the couch. Somehow having her back face the corner makes her feel safer...


**8:30pm.** - The lights turn off again. Jane is sufficiently creeped! When she flips the lights back on again the baby monitor goes wild. The 3-year old, laying down flat and screaming. She must be having a nightmare.


**8:35pm.** - Jane manages to calm the child down, Sarah, and see's that she was sleeping like a doll. Shutting the bedroom doors halfway, she goes back downstairs to the living room.


**8:50pm.** - A strange scraping noise, right? The noise isn't stopping... Jane calls her sister,  Kate, to come over. She's afraid to be in the house alone right now. While waiting for her sister, Jane locks all the doors and windows in the house. She even checks the garage, which is closed, and sees that nothing is out of place. 


**9:15pm.** - Kate arrives and rings the doorbell. She calls Jane a wimp and proceeds to the living room to do homework. They're both sitting on the couches


**9:30pm.** - The scraping noise is back... This time Kate goes to check it out. In the kitchen


**9:35pm.** - The baby monitor is making weird noises... it's static and strange scrapings... they turn it off. If they can hear upstairs from where they are


**9:40pm.** - Kate, and asks what's wrong. Kate stares, amazed, and asks if Jane can hear that. Obviously Jane can't, and tells her to stop fucking around trying to scare her. Kate starts humming a tune, and says that she hears piano playing in the house. She shakes her head and says nevermind.


**9:45pm.** - Jane, and wants to know if Kate hears it. Kate doesn't hear a thing... Jane hums the same tune... 


**9:50pm.** - Screaming, and presses video record. Her and Kate bolt up the stairs, and Jane films as they find the little girl.


**9:52pm.** - Ellie is in bed, and an endless scream spilling from her tiny lips. Kate grabs the child, trying to pick her up, but her limbs are bone stiff. They try to comfort her, but she isn't stopping her screams. Suddenly, the little girl starts bending, really jerky motions as her arms and legs twist. Kate tries to hold her down


**9:55pm.** - There is a Greek nativity hanging above the bed. The children's parents are Orthodox, a dark, deep, guttural shriek coming from a tiny 3-year old body. Kate puts the holy water back, terrified by Ellie's reaction.


Kate and Jane say a prayer in Greek, and the child points at her glowing nightlight. She yells, ""It's by the light, it's by the light, go away!"" Both Jane and Kate hold their fear inside, trying desperately to tell the girl she's dreaming and to calm down. Ellie eventually stops yelling about the light only to pass out into a deep sleep.


**10:10pm.** - Jane stops recording on her phone. She's excited she got all of it on camera. Both her and her sister check on Sarah


**10:15pm.** - Jane and Kate are walking downstairs when they hear a loud BANG. They rush towards the door to the garage, and the dragging scraping sound they heard outside. Neither are brazen enough to open the door. They call the parents to see when they will be home. 


**10:20pm.** - Clutching knives


**10:30pm.** - After much debating and after the banging noises have stopped, they crack the door open. Inside, it's a mess... and most interestingly, the garage door is closed. Even more... the deadbolt inside, that locks it from the outdoors, is still locked tight. The only way to have gotten in then was through the house, and they had locked the door to the garage. The door to the garage is in the living room where they sat listening to the raging that went on on the other side. Nobody came in or out.


**10:35pm.** - They pick up the garage. Putting things back on shelves


**11:00pm.** - The parents come home. The first thing they ask is why are all the lights on outdoors. Obviously both Kate and Jane want to know if they have any motion detection systems around the house? The parents laugh, and tries to show the video she took of the daughter having some sort of attack. Strangely, when she opens the file, it says it is corrupted and closes every time she tries to load it. Nothing is recorded, and nothing is believed by the parents. 




* Since then, has been diagnosed with anxiety problems and depression and she's only 5. The parents say she refuses and throws huge temper tantrums when they try to take her to the basement playroom. Sarah, the elder sister, has become very withdrawn and quiet. She doesn't remember hearing her sister's fit that night, even though their bedrooms are right across from each other and the doors were half-open. The parents are visibly shaken, but refuse to discuss any events with Kate or Jane.

A few months ago my brother called me very early in the morning which was strange as he normally waits till later in the day to call me (we are separated by two time zones). He started off the conversation by saying, my brother asked. ""I laid down with her so she would go to sleep quickly. We both ended up falling asleep. I faintly started to hear her piano make some noise. At first I thought maybe I was dreaming so I went back to sleep. A few minutes later I heard it again and in a half sleep daze I said, 'Sweetie please stop playing your piano and get back in bed.'"", my brother's wife explained. My brother's daughter instead rolled over in bed and said, ""Thats not me playing the piano, mommy."" That response certainly jolted my brother's wife wide awake. She grabbed their daughter and they both ran out the room. After hearing this my brother's first response was obvious, ""It's probably just an insect/pest/mouse running across the keys."" He decided to go check it out for himself. He started walking down the hall to the bedroom. About 15 feet from the door

Wow, it is likely you will know someone who may have knowledge of spiritual events. My brother called my Aunt not really knowing what to do. Never in his life had anything like that ever happened. The house he is living in used to be my parents house a few years before. We grew up in that house. Nothing like this had ever happened. My brother felt very vulnerable that night which was strange for him being that his career is in the military and had already been deployed twice to fight in the war.

My Aunt asked him if there was anything new in the house. My brother's first response was no. After a few hours he remembered that a few days before my grandmother had gifted his daughter an old porcelin doll that she picked up at garage sale. My Aunt said to get rid of the doll. He responded by saying that he was going to burn it right when he got home. She recommended burying it. As soon as he got home

   My grandparents used to live in this big creepy farm type house in Bryant, then kitchen, then living room and off to the back is the bathroom and my grandparents seperate bedrooms. The stairs to the second floor are through the kitchen and once upstairs there is a bathroom on your immediate left a bedroom straight ahead 2 more bedrooms off to the right of the first bedroom and a livingroom/ kitchen to the farthest right. 
         
  The upstairs seemed to have the most ""activity"" and the first of q few stories I've heard from family creeps me out the most. My aunt Jenny was a teen at the time (so this is like the mid 1960's) and shared the middle upstairs bedroom with 2 sisters. She was lying in bed one night
             
  Fast forward to the early 90's, my mom was on the porchswing with my grandma, dad was watching my grandpa drive my little sister around on his riding mower, and my brother and myself were playing near the bomb shelter. I suddenly felt weird and looked up at the house, there was an old lady in a flowery hat standing in the upstairs livingroom window. I tried pointing her out to my brother but she was gone.
   
   A few years before that (late 80's) my uncle Tim was still living at home. He had basically taken over the upstairs and stayed to himself a lot but I LOVED him and so any time we were there I wanted to hang out with him. I pestered my mom for a while to get Tim and she finally said ""go up and get him"" I went upstairs and heard a growling sound from the bathroom so I ran back down. My mom said ""It's probably Tim trying to scare you
     
 My plan was to sneak back up and hide in the livingroom and jump out at him when he came out of the bathroom. I got upstairs and the ""growling"" was still happening so I sneaked to the livingroom and there's Tim sitting on the couch watching TV. I started crying and made Tim go check the bathroom but there was no more growling and the bathroom was empty.
       
  I wish I could go back there now that I'm not so nervous about spooky things but the house was auctioned off to help pay for my grandpa's funeral in the year 2000. My grandma lives in a very un-haunted apartment now.  I hope you guys enjoyed my story. I have some more creepy stories I'll try to post another day. And if I can find one I'll add a pic of my grandparents house here soon.

I actually ended up doing way more research on the history of the property than I had originally intended to so I hope someone reads this. I’m also completely open to debunking what we’ve experienced in the house. I’ll start with the history of the house

I’ve always felt uncomfortable in that house. Particularly getting out of my car (that I had to park within sight of the cemetery) and walking to his house. It was a feeling I became familiar with at that house. The feeling like I needed to bolt. Something in my head always just said RUN but I always felt like the second I ran something would get me. I always felt like there was something nasty out there and I was always prepared to look up and see some creepy skeletor booking for me. I never felt particularly comfortable in the house but I felt downright unsafe when I was outside. There was something about his back yard and the woods behind his house that separated his yard from a really old cemetery (oldest grave I found went back to 1754 and the most recent were 1950’s save for a couple from mid 2000’s). Maybe this was all just me freaking myself out.

It all started back in high school when another friend (we'll call him B-Co because that's what we called him) and I helped my friend Mark and his mom move into their new house. He moved into this house in September 2006. The house was built in 1928 and after searching some public records I was able to find out that the house only had one previous *recorded* owner. The previous owner was a man born in 1938 who is now living somewhere in Florida. There is no purchase date on the house for the previous owner recorded online so my best guess is his family probably built the house and left it to him because other records seem to indicate he lived there from 1987 to 2007 (not sure why it says that when my friend moved there in 2006)

Our First Strange Experience: It was the first night we were there moving their stuff in. Mark and I had gone across the street to the river to sit on the rocks and have a smoke. Once we were good and stoned we made our way back to the house where B-Co and Mark’s mom were supposed to be moving stuff in. When we got back to the house the cars were still in the driveway but all the lights were off. We couldn’t find them anywhere. I’m telling you we searched the house top to bottom and even walked around outside looking for them. I can’t remember what we did after that but we left the house (but not the property) briefly and came back to find them in the kitchen putting stuff away. We asked them where they were and we made a joke that they were probably “doin it”. They said they’d been in the kitchen since we left. Strange because the kitchen is the first room you’re in when you enter the house from the back door (which was the only door they ever really used).

My friend Mark’s bedroom was a room at the back of the attic that was unfinished when they moved in. Before they carpeted and painted the attic the floor was just plywood with a big stain that looked like a blood stain. We made more jokes about this because even though it looked like old dried blood
By the time they start digging in the back yard it’s been a while since they moved in. Probably spring 2007. Not long after they started digging in the back yard (like a day or two later) is when weird things started happening. The first thing to happen was when Mark came home from school one day. In the basement they have this little pantry with an old wooden door with a latch (typical on old thin doors and gates). The pantry latch was securely closed but when he went into the pantry for a snack everything

The next thing that happened was really the first thing to truly unsettle me. We were at school when Mark gets a call from his mom asking if he’s home. Apparently while he was at school and his mom at work, creaking of the phone, tapping of the cord type of sounds). We would often hang out after school and this was one of those days. When we got back to his house his mom still wasn’t due home for a couple of hours. We looked and the only phone in the entire house is a corded phone attached to the wall in the kitchen at about eye level and it was on the hook, seemingly undisturbed. Weird, maybe it was some kind of hiccup. I don’t really know how phones work. Can a phone dial 911 without being off the hook? After this they filled in the hole and wouldn’t let anyone go near it.

Time passes, an old house. Nothing that couldn’t be rationalized one way or another. Though we always found an explanation for the weird sound, or what something moved, I always felt vulnerable in that house. I always felt the urge to bolt every time I was on the stairs. I could never get to the top of them fast enough and I HATED going to the bathroom alone. I always felt like someone was going to grab my ankles or push me down the stairs. Aside from the attic the other place I felt uncomfortable was the hallway where the downstairs bedrooms were. When you exit the attic stairs you’re in the dining room. Immediately to your right is a set of glass double doors with crystal door knobs that open up to a small hallway with the bathroom straight ahead, his mom’s room to your left and the unused bedroom to your right. Whenever I went to the bathroom I always felt like someone was standing in front of the unused bedroom door. The best I can describe it is like the feeling you get when you turn a corner and someone is right there but no one ever was and I never saw anything, I just got that feeling in my gut like when you turn a corner not expecting someone to be there. Same when I was leaving the bathroom, it felt like there was someone always waiting outside to use the bathroom.

Then I finally had my own “can’t just brush this off moment”. It was my first semester of college if I’m not mistaken. We were hanging out in the attic as per usual when Mark goes downstairs to get a snack or something. I was sitting in a recliner facing the center of the room where there is a mostly full black garbage bag. The garbage bag was dead center in the middle of my field of vision. All of a sudden a crumpled up paper towel lobs halfway across the room INTO THE GARBAGE BAG. I’m telling you, and then descend into the garbage bag. My jaw just dropped and then I went into a cold sweat, my heart has never beat so fast. I couldn’t get up I felt completely paralyzed with fear. All I could do was pull my knees to my chest and close my eyes tight and plug my ears until Mark came back upstairs. I didn’t want to see what threw that paper towel, didn’t want to hear it and definitely didn’t want it to touch me. There were no windows open, and it was crumpled in a ball so it’s not like it floated in the wind or anything. 5 years later I still have no way to explain how this could have happened.

One night we were hanging out in the back yard near the trees that border the cemetery when we started taking pictures of each other goofing off. We actually ended up getting quite a few orb photos and started hearing something crunching through the woods slowly. This could have been an animal but sounded more like a slow walk Though orb photos don’t usually do much for me I figured I’d include them. I keep them with the mindset that they neither confirm

Eventually Mark moved into the room in the basement because it was cheaper to heat and it felt even creepier. He ended up moving out less than a year after moving into the basement though his mom still lives there. I haven’t heard from him in a year to a year and a half and I’m not really sure why. He just stopped returning my calls and answering my messages and is never online anymore. I don’t know if there’s any correlation between the happenings at the house but I may never know. I don’t know where he moved to. My best friend for almost ten years and he just dropped off the face of the planet.

I have screen shots of the public records and some of the stuff I looked up on the previous owners of the home that I can provide upon request but all I can really gather is that the original owner did indeed have a son named Jeffrey who is/would be 48. From what I can tell he seems to be alive and well living in Massachusetts. So maybe it wasn’t Jeff haunting us but that’s what we always called him.

1357638715.0,166dbp,[ME] The Scariest Thing I've Ever Experienced,TheFarsider,67,24,17,"Ok here is my true story from a few years back. Although it is long and I am a shitty writer

Several years ago when I was a kid

 The gist of the game is pretty simple, and the cat-and-mouse nature of the game put us all in a very surreal mood. Like we were the characters in a movie. I will not bore you with the otherwise normal events of the game but eventually Matt and I were hiding in the large undergrowth beneath my deck which dominates my backyard. In some places the undergrowth is so thick it was hard to even walk through it. In other parts it is only covered by tall grass making it possible to see nearly the entire length of it. Matt and I were quietly trading each other's war stories of the game so far when suddenly the deck above our heads began to creak and moan. Immediately we became silent. Surprised at how fast Aaron must of gotten there. Then we heard footsteps directly above our heads on the deck. It sounded as if the person was walking in a small circle right above us. Like a vulture circling over its prey. As quickly as it started it abruptly stopped. What was odd was that the footsteps both started and stopped too far away from the lawn for the person to have gotten to that spot without making more footsteps to get there. I began whispering this observation to Matt before being interrupted by Aaron most unassumingly yelling out his frustration of being unable to find us. The quick switch from frightening and paranormal to normal would have almost of been funny if Aaron's yells hadn't  come from the front yard because it meant that he could not have been the one making the footsteps on the deck in the backyard.

We wanted to alert Aaron but were too scared of letting our presence being known to do anything about it. Eventually Aaron wandered into the backyard. He scanned the area for obvious indications of our hiding place. The fact that he did not see anything worth screaming about Matt and I got the confidence to walk out of the bushes (and subsequently me getting a ball thrown at my face) to tell Aaron about what had transpired. Frightened, crouch down, and flash what he thought was a cellphone in the direction of Aaron. Thinking it was whomever else was hiding, Aaron reciprocated the action before he heard me exclaim that I had gotten Matt and that he was now it somewhere else in the yard. Stunned, he turned back to where the figure was hiding but if anyone was there he could no longer make them out.

It escapes me now but for whatever reason we went back to playing balltag. Unfortunately for me, ""Oh well then I got Matt, you're it Matt."" and kept walking up the hill. At the top I looked down and waited for a response. ""Hey! Matt! I got you, you're it now!"" Still no response. Angry I kept walking away. Aaron stayed where he was. ""Hey, are you sure you got someone? No one is making a sound..."" ""Yes I'm sure I got someone, I saw an arm or something when I got them. If it wasn't you then it had to of been Matt he's just being dumb. He was hiding in that area of bushes below the walnut tree go get him."" That was when I turned the corner of my house and saw Matt hiding belly down on my trampoline. His eyes were wide for he heard the conversation and knew what it meant. I froze and stared into his eyes. Fear fell over me like a wave as what was happening slowly dawned on me.

""AARON GET OUT OUT OF THERE I JUST FOUND MATT UP HERE!! THAT'S NOT MATT!!'

Without saying a word Aaron ran up the hill, we were in full panic mode. We practically broke down the door getting inside. We each grabbed knives from the kitchen and locked every point of entry possible. After a little while we began talking about what had happened. I explained the cause of the noise and that although I was rather sure I saw an arm fly out of the bushes when I threw the ball, I could of been mistaken. Actually I was beginning to wonder if it was all an elaborate prank and that they had invited a fourth person to come and freak me out during balltag as Aaron did things like this constantly. However my suspicions were quickly swept away when I saw the state Aaron and Matt were in. Aaron said we should run to his house which was only a few houses down but quickly discarded it because it meant going outside. Matt asked several times for me to wake my parents up but I declined because my thought process was more or less I was a big boy now and could take care of my own problems and didn't want to look like a dumb kid to my parents. They were both super paranoid and I knew that neither of them knew what was going on.

I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend last August. Getting it so early was a bit of a surprise

The encounters started innocuously enough. I felt something creeping up my leg while I was sitting on the floor in the living room

Then there was the laundry room. The laundry room, some shelves and is the only room in the apartment that has a free hanging light with a string with which to turn it on.

Neither my boyfriend or I go in there too often, it wouldn't budge. It was less creepy at this point and more bizarre. 

Really

The ""faucets"" incident is the second most recent encounter we've had. My boyfriend wakes up at 3am to go to work at 4am, cleaning, picking up clothes, etc. I got into the master bedroom and was opening the window when I heard the distinct sound of running water. I thought maybe it was coming from outside - someone washing their car - but noticed the lower parking lot was empty.

I walked back out into the hallway and peered into the bathroom to find that the sink was running water. I had not been in the bathroom since around 8 or 9 that morning and it was now nearing 11. I had also been walking through the apartment since I'd been up

Then it happened again! And again! *And again!* Once more it happened with the sink in the bathroom

The most recent encounters we've had have been the opening of cabinets in the kitchen. It was just one cabinet in the beginning

I'm so used to these happenings by now that the cabinets are just another weird thing to me

I don't really know what to think of these things. I'm a rational person (everyone says that, I'd be happy to hear any. 

ASIDE: I guess it's also something to note that the opening of cabinets has occurred in the past few days and has been persisting for a week. I thought that maybe the recent influx of activity was because this would be about the time that the man was to die. But I don't know.

EXTRA ASIDE: I've been thinking about running my webcam all day in the area of the living room that looks into the kitchen and down the hallway

*EDIT1: While we were in the house, I can do that, but I don't know if that would be very interesting.

1339887039.0,v5ml2,[me][fam][o] One of the reasons we moved out,roltrap,52,9,8,"I'm not much of a story teller nor am I a firm believer in the paranormal but I feel that what my wife and I experienced in while living in Germany  is worth putting some time and effort in this.

Here is where it starts: I was working as an IT consultant in Belgium when I met my future wife 3 years ago over an online MMORPG called Runes Of Magic. To make a long story short: I left my job eventually to move to Germany to be with her. We rented an appartment in Kierspe (Nordrhein Westfalen

We where kind of poor since we lived of what they call 'Arge' money

It started with smells of perfume. The kind you would expect an elderly woman to wear. We would smell it every day in all rooms of the appartment and none of us used that kind of perfume.

I thought it was coincidence and I thought none of it but my wife was very nervous. She didn't feel at ease there. She mentioned it every day that something was wrong but I always told her it was nothing and that she shouldn't be worried.

One night I was playing runes of magic while wife and both kids where asleep. All was quiet and I was relaxing and playing until suddenly something hard hit me on the head. It was a toy from one of these surprise eggs. I was the only one in the room. It hurt pretty bad and allthough I don't give a crap about these things I was pretty confused about it. I didn't mention it to my wife until the next occurence.

A few days later my wife got freaked out while cleaning because one of our daughters playing strollers (the ones with a doll in it) started moving by itself. I didn't think much of it but I did mention what happened before with me. Needless to say she was getting more and more nervous. I didn't doubt what she saw but I was still kind of sceptical. 

The next one was the one that got me doubting. She went to her parents place (Kölnerstrasse in Kierspe for those who care) so I dropped her off and went to do my thing. We would just meet again in the appartment. I got home and as I pulled out the keys to open the door I saw someone walking from my daughters room to the bathroom (shadow of a person walking
I opened the door and guess what... nobody there.
that is when I got kind of freaked out. 
I called her at her parents place and told her and she also got freaked out but she came back that same day.

Now the freakiest part: kids where asleep. My pc was in one room, so I went there and asked 'what is it?' 
At the same time the light in my room goes out and she tells me she didn't call me. Then we both realised my light just went out.

The last straw was when my wife woke up with severe claw scratches on her leg (pictures on bottom of the post) that hurt like hell. She didn't notice until she woke up and she was sleeping next to me all night.
I don't have sharp nails and to be honest no human nails could have done that kind of precise damage. she still has scars of it today after all those years (pictures below

I know I'm not much of a story teller but that is also not my goal. Just trying to tell what happened.
We decided to move out asap because we didn't feel at peace.

here are some pictures of the appartment just to give you an idea how it looked like and how we lived (we didn't have alot of money)

If you want more information please ask me. As I said I suck at story telling but this really happened and I do not know what to make of it.

Part 3 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b9skk/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

This happened to me in the beginning of the school year during a break we had sometime early in the year (I remember this because a couple of my old high school friends were back from a college an hour away.) I am a college freshman living in North Dakota

I can promise you that no matter how far-fetched the upcoming tale may sound, witnesses, or anything you need me to in the comments if you'd like. Please excuse my writing if it isn't up to par. This is my first post, and I've only been on TTIH for a few days.
This all started when I was with 4 friends in my car. In North Dakota, on a weekday, when you're 18. So, we went to a friend's house, but quickly got bored, then went for the drive where our story begins. We were driving down a well-traveled road that I had never been to the end of before. It ended up turning into rural dirt roads past fields after a roundabout a few miles on. I forget the conversation, but I remember, ""Man, man."" I know

The next night, all creepy, and the bus was blown up from a meth lab exploding. Apparently some people died there when it happened. We weren't there because it's a good place to frighten our friends who had never been there before. Myself and 4 friends drove past a wal-mart that is directly by, and as we drive by, my friend Rhett (who is EXTREMELY superstitious) says he saw a black cat cross the cars path and we should turn back. We question his sexuality and press on to the house. At the house, we get out to relieve ourselves. Connor and I go North of the car closer to the house, and Rhett and Sam go south of the car closer to the forest. Collin waits to the east of the car. Connor and I finish peeing, we hear what sounded like someone rolling over in the dry grass. We look at each other, heavy footsteps. One right after the other. As though someone was walking, then we heard what sounded like someone slowly rolling over

Anyway, and I don't really know if they believed me. We were driving past the wal-mart when something was in the road. I got closer in my car, and there was a black cat waiting in the middle of the road. Completely still except for its tail that was casually flicking back and forth. I slowly came to a stop. Told everyone what was in the road. Rhett was freaking out, and I swear the cat and I made eye contact for at least 10 seconds, then it casually padded away, and disappeared into a corn field in the direction of the house. We reversed back to the walmart parking lot so we could stay out of its path. Then we went to get gas and snacks at a nearby gas station. We went back to that place, taking the non-cat road
This is the end of the first (and least creepy night of the 7 days that things were happening to me. Just because of how long this is taking to tell, unexplained animal behavior occuring again and again and again and again, and the most ungodly sound I've ever heard occured later on. It only gets better from here if you want to hear more.)

http://goo.gl/maps/IenTX - I linked the abandoned house here. The picture must have been taken either before or after the buses and vehicles were there, the rubble pile, the parking lot we pulled into, and the garage directly north of the parking lot.
If you zoom out more

*EDIT* The road that we saw the black cat on is labeled as 55th Avenue south on google maps. We saw the cat right after passing the first right turn into the walmart parking lot

1361987324.0,19c71a,[ME] college rental house,crockey1007,56,13,14,"I've been reading this subreddit a lot and even though my experience isn't nearly as terrifying as a lot I have read here, some have happened multiple times so I will just list each thing once:

1. My friend and I were napping on the floor in the basement watching watership down when we both woke up at the exact same moment to the loud and distinct sound of toenails being clipped. for some reason it just scared the shit out of us so bad that we had to leave the house for several hours. It sounded so distinctly like toenails being clipped that weeks later I heard it again and freaked out so bad only to find that my roommate was actually clipping her toenails. We shrugged it off as the house ""settling"" or whatever but in the following 2 years we have never heard the noise again. 

2. I have an obsession with making sure every single cabinet in the kitchen is closed before I go to bed and several times I have woken up to every cabinet open and my roommates swear they didn't do it.

3. The kitchen/laundry room in the basement (where we heard the clipping sound from) is by far the creepiest area of the house. When my friend and I were the only ones living there we had a small table and two chairs down there that we never even touched because we tended to avoid the basement except for doing laundry. They were shoved into a corner of the room but one day my roommate came downstairs to find them in the middle of the room. We didn't have any pets at this time.

4. Once we did get a cat and a dog, hissing/barking at things in the kitchen/hallway by the kitchen. 

5. The summer I lived with just one roommate we both had bedrooms in the basement but she refused to sleep down there because she was too freaked out by it so she slept on the couch most nights. One night I had almost fallen asleep when I heard by roommate walk downstairs and into her room and it sounded like she rummaged around for a while

6. My roommate who was a little more superstitious than me said whenever I was gone overnight she would have a horrible time sleeping because she would hear heavy footsteps all night. 

7. This is the creepiest one because it happened once we had 6 people living in the house. Most of the previous ones occurred when there were only two of us so we tended to freak ourselves out about it and once more people moved in it really died down and we forgot about it. However, not a computer, TV or anything, they asked me to describe what I heard. I said it sounded like a little girl singing but not with words, like ""la-la-la-la-la-la"" like a kids show or something. It still freaks me out so bad because that's exactly what my roommate that was sitting second closest to the stairwell told the other 2 guys he heard. The other 2 said they couldn't hear well enough, they just heard something. 

Everyone in the house besides the two of us that spent that first summer alone there was still somewhat skeptical but after that last encounter they started believing us. Since then similar things continue to happen but there are so many of us in the house I can usually shrug it off.

It didn't exactly smell like smoke but that was the closest thing I could attribute it to. It happened quite frequently at first but as time passed it happened less and less frequently to the point I can't remember the last time I have smelled it. I was the only person who ever smelled it even through other people were in my room when I could smell it. I never saw smoke or anything I could just smell it.

1354745003.0,14chis,[ME] An disturbing encounter with my deceased Grandmother.,CFishVox,55,10,8,"(A)* Disturbing encounter with my deceased Grandmother

Throughout my life, I began to notice as I got older that my dad would quickly change the subject whenever my grandma's death was brought up.

When I was about 14 or 15 years old, let's call her Samantha, told us that she had experienced direct contact with our grandma (they also never got to meet her due to her untimely death).  

After she told my brother and I about her paranormal experience, and said, ""No... she killed herself.  Shot herself in the head.""  My heart immediately sank because I had always known my parents had kept something about her death from me, but I had no idea they had flat out covered up my own grandmother's suicide.  

My brother asked Samantha why she did it, simply said, ""Grandpa.""  My brother and I were astonished.  I asked them what my grandpa could have possibly done to drive his wife to suicide.  Barb said that it was because she had suspicions that my grandpa was cheating on her.  Samantha further explained that my aunt (her mother) had to clean her blood off of the walls. She also said that my father had always blamed himself because he had just gone off to college; he felt if he had still been home she would still be alive.  That was why he always changed the subject when we spoke of her.

That night, I still sort of prayed and talked to God and deceased relatives (I'm an atheist nowadays).  I started having a mental conversation with my grandmother and told her I knew the truth about her death.  I was still skeptical as to why, so I asked her the real reason she did it because I wanted to know the truth.  

I kid you not, and was immediately terrified.  I whipped myself out of bed and turned my lamp on.  No one was there.  

The reason I was so terrified is because my grandpa's name is Edward.  I have never seen or heard from my grandmother since that day.  I admit that I have tried talking to her again a couple of times,,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,True

I feel this place is more appropriate since it all really happened to me. ,The1nOnlySilent,54,8,10,"I have had a ghost following me around for the past 7 years now. It used to really freak me out; but I guess I've gotten used to him.

It started when I was 16 and I had a dream; and not just any normal dream. Usually I am a lucid dreamer and I always know when I am asleep and can change my dreams as I please. Also
In the dream I woke up to my dog getting up because she needed to go outside. I am a clutter bug and my room was always pretty messy with random thing lying about or piled places, so I walk down the hall and into the entry way opening up the heavy wooden door followed by the glass door to get outside where the entire neighborhood is normal and the weather was just as it really was. After my dog was finished with her business she started barking at something, as she tends to do, and started running after it. I just figured she saw a raccoon or something and walked down from the porch into the yard trying to get her to come back. She circled completely around my neighbors house then came running straight at me still chasing something. Then I get hit and knocked to the ground; I freaked out and jumped up running up to the door calling Ginger to come with me. I tried to pull the glass door shut first, but it is a hydrolic hinge and wasn't cooperating so I went the slam the heavy wooden door shut, but something hit up against it and was pushing it back against me.

I woke up completely startled at this point relieved that it was just a dream

Ever since I had that dream weird things started happening. There were 2 phones in my house both on the same phone line. One was in the dining room and one was in my bedroom. Sometimes just the phone in my room would ring; if someone else went back to answer it, one night I was up later than the rest of my family out on the computer when I heard noises from the garage. The garage door had been shut for at least 3 hours already at this point. When I went out there the garage door to the side my car is parked on was just going up and down. My mom heard it as well and came out and she watched it just going up and down with me for awhile after checking the sensors to make sure nothing was in the way. After a few minutes I said, ""Nathaniel, stop it!"" and the door went down and stayed down. That was pretty weird.
Another thing that would happen even after I moved out of my parents house, and even at the one I am living in now; my friends will call me and I will be completely alone and they will stop and ask who I am with. They say they can hear a boys voice coming from my end of the phone and it's always the same one. They can never make out what he is saying though.

When I left for my first year of college I came back that first weekend to pick up things I had forgotten. Shortly after I left to go back
At my first apartment, but then I put my own hand over it and the hand print was much larger than my hands could have made. I have some pretty small hands.

Oh! I almost forgot! Awhile after I told my family about it my sister and I decided to do some research on the web. We found a boy with the name of Nathaniel who died during the Civil War... there was a picture of his grave stone... he had the same last name as us. Talk about weird!

TL;DR: Ghost boy has been following me around doing weird stuff for about 8 years now.

Edit: Since originally posting this a year ago, but she never saw anyone. When I came in from playing she asked who I was playing with, and I just told her ""the boy"".

Being a bunch of dumb teenagers, we got out of there pretty quickly and silently agreed not to talk about it again. I haven't seen any of them in a few years.

I went back the next year with my sister. The first night we were there, but this time I heard the muffled screaming from the boat as well.

1361299121.0,18ty5a,"[ME] Two voices having a conversation constantly changing gender, age, and direction.",NatchBox,52,13

In 6th grade I had a dog for a brief period of time named Snoopy. I walked him every morning before leaving to school. 

This particular morning I was running late so my mom agreed to drive me. I was in a rush to avoid being tardy so I quickly leashed snoopy and dashed to the garage exit to our house. 

I raced Snoopy to the door and threw myself against it winning the race and successfully getting Snoopy super excited to take a morning poop. 

Without really thinking about it i stopped dead in my tracks. (I was holding the door open at this point and simply standing in the doorway looking outside) 

I was suddenly filled with fear and i couldn't understand why. I found it very hard to move. I glanced down and noticed snoopy who was extremely excited just moments ago was standing perfectly still staring forward. 
I was about to try to move forward when I heard this chilling voice. It sounded like a young kid chatting in a normal tone. The chilling part was the fact that the direction the voice was coming from seemed to constantly change. At first I thought the kid was right outside the door to my right then much further away then even behind me. It was also in a language I had never heard before (this isn't too weird since I only knew Spanish and English at the time but I live in a suburb where English is pretty much the only language in existence). The language sounded like gibberish and just a series of made up words strung together. 

Another weird thing was that despite never hearing this language before I felt like I was always on the cusp of understanding what it was trying to say but could never quite make it out. 

By this time another child began responding to the first voice and the two sounded like they were having a pleasant conversation judging by the tone. 

My feeling of unexplained fear intensified as the voices began to change age. They became deeper and much more horrifying. I glanced down at snoopy again to see his reaction to the events still talking place. He remained motionless. 

After what felt like 10 minutes of listening in fear to these voices they suddenly stopped. I suddenly regained my composure and burst out the door in hopes of finding some sort of source. I saw no one in all directions. 

The story doesn't really end there. I was overcome with curiosity by this event and quickly memorized some ""words"" that I had heard in hopes of ask jeevesing them at school (not terribly Internet savvy at this point) 

While driving to school I noticed (while repeating these 10 or so ""words"" in my head) that I began to just suddenly forget them. I tried to focus but was shocked to find that a word I had just repeated in my head was suddenly gone. 

Within seconds my 10 key ""words"" diminished into only two. In hopes to grasp on to them I muttered one out loud. (if I was to spell out the sound I made it would be something like wumbo or womba. Silly I know but the pronunciation was kind of guttural and the middle of the word was extended like wuuuuuumbo. Still silly out of context but what can I say that's what it was.) 

Anyway my mom jumped slightly at the sound of my voice. ""what did you say?"" she looked kind of scared. Feeling silly I explained my experience hoping she might have heard it too. To my disappointment she had no idea what I was talking about and thought I was trying to scare her so I dropped it. Returning to my memory exercise I realized that I forgot the last term. 

I used ask jeeves later at school but of course got nothing from searching wumbo. 

Nothing similar occurred after that event and I still don't know exactly what I heard but all explanations paranormal or not are welcome.

I don't know if its worth noting that I've seen moving shadows or ""shadow people"" twice in that house. Once when I was much younger and the other time just recently over winter break (in college now.) 

I don't know what I hoped to gain be retelling this story (I don't think about it much anymore) but maybe someone will get something out of it. If anyone has had a similar experience please do not hesitate to share. I've conveyed this to some close friends and girlfriends throughout my life but most never seem to find it that weird or relate. 

TLDR: Heard two ""people"" have a conversation in a gibberish language while trying to walk my dog. Tried to remember the ""words"" look them up later but my brain seemed to erase them instantly after repeating them over and over internally.",,t5_2sntx,1361312100.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18ty5a/me_two_voices_having_a_conversation_constantly/

I don't know if this can be explained away by medical reasons

We moved into a townhouse about 6 months ago. It's fairly new so you wouldn't expect it to be haunted

Anyway my daughter was 14 months old when we moved in, reaching out for me. I tried to soothe her, but every night for a week she just cried and cried like she was terrified. Eventually from sheer exhaustion I put the portacot up for her and she went straight to sleep.

I wouldn't think this was too strange except for some other weird things. One night my partner woke me up when he got home from work, and although I'd heard that sort of thing before when no one was upstairs , I had mostly ignored it. 

Then just now my daughter went for a bath. It is winter in Australia, as normal, then went to her room to get her some clothes. All of a sudden she screamed, and I ran into the bathroom to find her huddled in the corner of the tub shivering, her skin a little blue. The water was still warm. I pulled her out and wrapped her in a towel, then took her to her room. I tried to take the towel off to dress her but she cried and tried to stop me. I touched her skin beneath the towel and she was really cold all over. I took the towel off and cuddled her in a blanket for about five minutes, but she was still really cold to the touch and her lips were blue. I managed to wrestle her into some warm clothes and now we're outside in the sun.

When I was 13, and I had taken our suitcases and what not into the house while my dad stayed outside unloading the tables and equipment in the garage alone until we had finished inside and could get back outside to help.

I was in my room emptying my suitcase when I felt a shiver up my spine.  The air in my room got thicker, but we all kind of described it the same way and this was the closest thing the experience felt like.)

All of a sudden I felt like I was called outside.  I never heard my name nor felt uncomfortable in my bedroom

It's important to note here that I knew what had happened because the only times I had ever seen this look on his face were the 2 previous times he'd seen the ghost of my grandmother, but both in my bedroom.

My mom asks, ""You just saw Grandma, didn't you?"" He looked at me in further disbelief, like how did you know, but didn't address that concern and said ""Yeah, but this time she spoke.""  

The first time he saw her, smiled, put her hands together as if to pray, bowed her head, and then disappeared.  The second time he saw her was at the same house.  It was at night, but I was spending the night off somewhere.  He passed by my room and something his eye on the periphery.  He looked in my room and saw her sitting on the edge of my bed, looking in the direction of the TV as if she was watching it, she turned to him

This time was different.  He said he pulled a table out of the back of the van and was carrying it into the garage when he felt like he was being watched.  He turned around to see my grandmother hovering (as he described it) next to the fence.  He said he described it as hovering because she was on eye level with him which wouldn't have been possible (he's 6'1"" and she was 5'4"") and he couldn't see the bottom half of her legs.  He said it just kinda blurred out past her knees, ""Hi, mom.""  He said she smiled and said, ""I just wanted to check in to tell you to stop worrying all the time.  And I'm so proud of Breanna.""

Well when he was relaying this story, light as feather stiff as a board stuff, the Ouija board, ghost stories, you name it.  Nothing ever really phased me.  If anything creepy every happened, it sparked my curiosity and made me press further.  This should've thrilled me.  I was the grandkid closest to my grandmother before she passed.  I spent every day with her instead of going to day care while my parents worked.  I loved her, but the idea of seeing her just pop up in my room one day creeped me out.

After he told me this, and we sat there talking about it.  He theorized that she was probably coming to me because I was the one closest to her.  I also had her old bedroom furniture so he thought maybe the familiar surroundings were part of what drew her back to my room as well.  He convinced me to not be afraid of my room by explaining that she loved me and would never do anything to intentionally scare me.  He felt like our discussion was enough because she would hear that I was scared and not try to show herself to me until she thought I was ready to handle it, if that time ever came. 

I accepted this explanation and as he was getting ready to leave, would make different shapes and patterns and swirls in it.  He asked me what it was because he didn't remember seeing it but thought it was cool.  When he flipped it over, the shape of a heart appeared in the dead center of the little 4x6 frame.  The heart was made of the water with the sand lining the edges of it.  The sand appeared to be suspended mid-air in order to make the heart shape appear.  Now, there may be an explanation to debunk that, but not knowing anything about buoyancy or anything like that, we were both unable to come up with a logical explanation for it.  We both saw the shape at the same time and he said, ""See?  That's her way of telling you she understands.  You won't have to worry about seeing her until you're ready.""

In the year 2000 when I was 10 years old my parents sent me to a 5 day summer camp in Huntsville, but I got along well with my peers.

Me and 7 other girls were staying in the room on the far right, but our camp counselor opened the little door at the top of the room and told us to be quiet, so we all went to bed.

Out of nowhere I hear Brianna yelling ""Cat wake up right now! Cat wake up"" and being the light sleeper I was I immediately woke up, curly hair sitting on the ladder leading up to the top bunk on the bed in front of mine. The moonlight illuminated the entire room, and this figure was completely opaque, shaking (her, I think?) long curly hair. I looked around the room and noticed all of the girls were all accounted for and definitely awake. I stared at this thing for what seemed like an eternity. Everyone of the girls were were being completely hysterical and crying, but I was dead silent, I couldn't make a peep. I was completely terrified to the point I couldn't blink or even move. I mean what could I have done? The thing was sitting there right before my eyes. Then this figure stands up and jumps off of the ladder and just stood at the edge of the bed for a moment. All of the girls screaming ""Cat, I finally then find the nerve to book it out of the bottom bunk and run to the other side of the room. I run up to Brianna and Angel's bunk and climb the ladder as quickly as I could. At this point I started becoming hysterical and crying like the rest of them. The figure was still standing near my bed. Angel and I started hugging

About 5 minutes after we hear screams coming from the room directly across the hall from us. We all started crying again, please please don't make us stay in here! It's going to kill us!"" To which the counselor sternly responded with ""That's impossible, now quiet down and go to bed. This is the last time I am going to say this.""

After about 20 minutes of quietly talking

About a week after the camp trip had ended I contacted both Angel and Brianna and asked them if they remembered that night and they both said yes

1337407851.0,tuf5j,Work experience left us baffled,hightidelowmoon,50,9,13,"Hi gang!


I lay in bed last night trying to rationalise what I saw at work yesterday but I just can't. I work in a charity (thrift) shop and was in the sorting room with two volunteers. They had just arrived for their shift and we were having a good old natter before we got started. 


During our conversation, it tipped gracefully to the left at a 45 degree angle (right wheels off the floor). We were stunned to silence. The rail then swung, equally gracefully, all the way over to the right at a 45 degree angle (left wheels off the floor). We looked on as the rail then snapped back to an all wheels on the floor position in a sudden jerking slam that left the empty hangers swinging violently on the rail. 

The whole event took mere seconds and confused the heckers out of us. Baffled, just utterly confused. I cant understand why it didn't just fall over. It should have fallen when it tipped to the left but it decided that it was going to break the laws of physics instead and swing back in the opposite direction before coming to an abrupt end back where it started.

The shop is housed in an extremely old building and from time to time


I'm going to try to find out more by chatting to the shop managers on either side of us to see if anything's happened to them in the past as we've only been here 6 months. Intrestingly enough,,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,True
1317429214.0,kx1ty,Beware of rental houses,dntworryihaveadegree,49,3,14,"I apologize if this is kind of long, I’ll give you a little background on the circumstances and myself. The house is located in Georgia, and a garage/basement bedroom downstairs. My boyfriend and I slept in the master bedroom on the main floor

Not long after we moved in, but there was definitely something wrong with that house.  My first actual experience began when I was home alone one evening, studying for class. I was in the living room with the TV on, but not really paying attention to it. The remote was on coffee table when I noticed the lighting change on TV, so I looked up from my book and saw that it had switched to the Jesus channel. Weird, but nothing that can’t be explained by some sort of technological glitch. Well, from that day on, or where the remote was located, sitting in the living room, until things started happening to them. 

One weekend my boyfriend and I were out of town, she heard a loud thud come from my bathroom, which is inside of my bedroom. She thought maybe one of our cats had gotten inside my room or something, so she went in to see what the little rascals were up to. After opening the bedroom door and looking around, she realized that neither of our cats was in the room. So, she went back to her bathroom, and a couple minutes later she heard what sounded like a blow-dryer coming from my bathroom. She thought it was better not to investigate the noise this time

Flash forward to a couple months later. I woke up one morning and Kate told me about something that happened to her and her boyfriend that night. They had just lain down to go to sleep, something tapped her on her forehead. She thought it was her boyfriend being a smartass, but he too had turned on his side, and was facing the opposite side of the bed. I thought that was odd, so I went to tell my boyfriend what happened. However, before I could get out the story, he told me how something tapped his forehead last night when we were laying in bed. Now, you would know that he’s incredibly logical and skeptically of all things paranormal. 

Throughout our time at the house, because we were smoking a cigarette. We happened to glance over to the door during our conversation, and we see this Jamaican/African looking guy walking down our driveway. We thought that was kind of odd, and since Tyler was asleep upstairs, we quickly closed the garage door. Kate ran upstairs to look out the window and keep an eye on this guy, while I went and woke up Tyler. Kate said she didn’t see him at all when she was looking out the front window of the house; the garage doors are clearly visible from this window. After I woke him up, I ran out back, and Kate went around the side of the house. We looked all around the outside of the house, so it’s not like he quickly sped off. 

I might also mention that my boyfriend started to develop chronic and intense leg pains. He went to numerous doctors and specialists, and gas leaks; nothing was found. He suffered from these ailments until the day we moved out of that house, and he’s never experienced them again. 

Prior to living in this house, I never checked the records or old newspapers, so I don’t know if anything terrible ever happened to anyone there before we moved in. All I know is, every time I move into a new place, I’m always a little anxious the first couple of weeks. Luckily, my boyfriend and I have moved twice since living in the house and nothing remotely weird has happened to either of us.

I grew up in a very rural town in East Texas right along the Sabine River which is just a stone’s throw away from Louisiana. My house was at the end of a farm to market road which ended with my house and a few others. Behind my house was a huge field that stretch all the way back towards the woods which ran to the Sabine.

Where the paved road ended there was a metal gate with a cattle guard which blocked a dirt road. Very rural. If you're looking straight on at my house the dirt road would be to your right. We would walk down the dirt road every once in a while by hoping the fence or crawling through it. No big deal. Me and my dad or my friends would walk down the road and just look around, you know just looking around.
To the left of my house was a field and an old barn. On the paved road that led to our house was a few houses that set off the road. The paved road ended when you reached our house and turned to gravel. At that point was where the field started. It was small and led to a tree line right by our property. If you walked the tree line parallel to our house it would take you to an old creek bed that led to the Sabine. The creek bed had a thick canopy of trees

So this is our play area. This is our forest and adventureland and we made use of everything around there.
One day my friends over and we're around 10 years old. So, dirt, old weathered wood - but hanging from the roof was bones tied to the end of rope. Kind of weird. We made up stories about how it was voodoo or some other crap but didn't really care about it.
After exploring the barn we decided to walk down the creek bed and go to the river. I had my bb gun so we were shooting trees. Basically being 10 year old kids. We walk down to the river and throw rocks in the water

As we get back to the field next to the barn we both had this weird feeling like we were being watched. That's when we see it. I don't know what it was. I know that we both saw it and it's there just watching us. We looked at each other and asked, like almost black, and standing at the edge of the tree line almost in the field staring at us. We couldn't make out much detail other than the height -around 7 feet. The look - dark, almost black and shaggy. It had its arms down but holding them out from its body so that we could make out the figure of two arms and two legs. Impossible large and black.

When we asked each other if we saw it

1361084598.0,18okv0,Spirit Winds,Chilkoot,47,7,7,"I posted this to /nosleep quite a while back not realizing it was an amateur fiction writers' board. I would be very interested to know if anyone here has had or heard of similar experiences. 

This isn't a particularly 'scary' story

It started about 15 years ago. My (now) wife and I were coming home from a day out, like the A/C in the car had suddenly come on. We both reacted by reaching for the console air controls, but it was clearly turned off. Assuming something had broken, our next reaction was to put our hands in front of the vents to see where the unexpected breeze was coming from, but we found it was not emanating from any of the vents, the windows all being closed as well.

This really perplexed us, and we'd look into it later on. The strange swirling breeze continued against our hands and faces for maybe 30 or 40 seconds longer as we wound our way to the bottom level of the garage, then stopping as suddenly as it started. Again, it was an old car, so we didn't give it much thought, but we both noted that it seemed a strange an unnatural breeze - being both warm and cold at the same time. It was slightly unnerving, but still pretty low on the weirdness scale.

We noted the time as exactly 7:45 - it was memorable as my wife did not want to miss Star Trek which started at 8:00

The next day we arrived at work (we worked together at the local university) to a very somber environment. We soon learned that another employee

This young lady who had died was quite a loner, she had remarked how nice it was to have friends again and not to be so alone.

When my wife and I learned of the time of her death - 'shortly before 8:00 PM' we looked at each other, we took some comfort in the possibility (implausible as it seemed), and the memory of the event stayed clear in our minds for years.

A few years later, we looked knowingly at each other and became very concerned... Was this another 'visit' from a loved one on the way out? My wife was quite concerned for the baby - a fear quickly allayed by a few solid kicks shortly after the breeze stopped. Sure enough, a few hours later, the phone rang. My grandfather, who I had a very close relationship with and held in very high regard, had passed from a stroke at my parents house some 1200 miles away.

Over the years, holding up our hands, feeling it move around us, we look at each other, worriedly, and wait for the phone to ring. We've become so accustomed to it, that we've even started to speak out loud and say things like ""Who is this? We'll miss you - don't worry about us, speaking to the breeze has never had any effect on the duration or intensity of the winds.

Now my wife and I are both fairly objective, especially in a group setting. However, a good scientist can't ignore evidence even when it flies in the face of their current world view, and multiple predictive successes over the course of years with no false positives starts to count as 'significant' in my books, even if we can't initiate an experiment to test the theory out (well, I guess we could, but you know).

At any rate, with a very strong correlation to the actual time of death (15 minutes one way or the other in every case).

Take away from this what you will, I'll try to fill in any blanks I may have left.

**Mystery may be solved. Thanks to BurmecianDragoon for the information.
  This dog may have been what is known as a Shuck (also known as Black Shuck

""Sometimes it is reported to be a friend and protector of women; the shadowy canine walks with lone women and accompanies them to their destination, it does not harm them in any way.""  

""The size of this spirit dog has been reported to be everything from that of a large dog to the size of a full-grown horse.**

  I was around fifteen years old when this happened to me, from what I recall, so I had been out at a friends house all night. And when I say all night, I do mean all night. By the time I started walking home, it was around 4 or so in the morning.  It was not a long walk from my friends house to mine, only about a mile and a half, but I had to cross a semi busy street in the process. 

  It was a nice evening from what I recall, suburban houses typical to the San Fernando Valley (where I lived way back then) quiet and dark. No cars on the street I was currently walking on, although every once in a while a car would flash by on the street up ahead. 

  About halfway up the block, it was a dog. As many times as I had walked back and forth to my friends house, I had seen many of the neighborhood dogs and cats, but NEVER this dog.  
  This dog was a Rottweiler, the docked tail and all, but the size of a Great Dane, or maybe a large Mastiff. Big, big, big dog - much, much bigger than a normal Rotty should be.
  I stopped, he sniffed, and his stump of a tail began to wag. He sat down, and I patted his head, calling him a good doggy, and wondering where his house was, and if he was lost, and just continued to enjoy getting pet. 

  Finally, and wont ever change it.) I gave him a final pat on the head, and moved to go around him... and he got up, and continued walking right by my side, just like a good, trained dog would. I continued to pet him randomly, and was telling him he should go home

  We approached the major street just as the yellow light was hitting. I stopped to wait, a car approached. It was swerving slightly.  This car, an old 70s-ish car from what I remember, brownish in color,  tan maybe.  Might have been a Concourse or a Nova - not really sure. As it passed, I could see it filled with occupants, and could hear loud music playing from the car speakers. Then the car stopped dead, and began to back up. 
  I was watching as it got closer, and they had all started up a ruckus - hooting and hollering, with the usual bs that seemingly drunk guys will yell out at a girl, ""Hey baby"", ""Wanna party with us"", ""Dude, look at her""... then I heard ""Lets get her""
  At this point, stood up and began growling, barking and basically throwing a shit fit. The guy who had started getting out of the car paused, looked back in the car, shook his head then got right back in the car. I had knelt down beside the dog, kind of holding him back, and kind of just holding on to him for comfort - it was like having my own personal huge living teddy bear to hug
  The guys in the car took off, but this time, seemed much more alert, ears forward, looking around. His side was brushing me as we walked. It was very comforting.

  When we got to my house, sniffed around, then proceeded to curl up right on the doorstep. I again told him to go home, pet him and then went inside. 
  When I went outside later, as he did not have a collar on or anything else that indicated who his owners might be. 

  I asked my dad later if he had seen the dog when he got up in the morning (my dad used to get up super, after I had gotten home that night). He said no he had not seen any dog, and could not remember ever seeing a dog of that size and description in the nieghborhood, ever. 

  Coincidence? Maybe. But it just seems very... convenient... for a dog of that size, to have shown up at that exact moment, half a block and minutes away from when I encountered those jerks in the car. I just think.. what would have happened if that nice dog had not been there?

My mother told me that when she was little her family briefly lived in a converted barn type house.  She was only about 5 and her room was the uppermost room in the attic.  One day she was up there and found she could not exit the room.  It was like a forcefield was in the way at the doorway, but she said that eventually her father 'tricked' the ghost by turning away and ushering the rest of the family away and said something along the lines of 'we can't do anything, lets leave' and then made the motion to begin walking, then suddenly whisked round, grabbed my mother and bolted down the stairs.

 I didn’t even know my hometown was supposed to be haunted until ABC came to our little town for their Halloween series on the top 13 haunted places in the world.  The neighborhood where I grew up was normal… well

We had a tight community that was the only sign of civilization out in the boonies.  On the west side of the neighborhood we were surrounded by “the field” and to the east was “the woods” north was “the ravine” and south was “the pond.”  Each of these places held their own adventures
This is what wigs me out about my experience.  It didn’t happen in the dark, and we’re talking about one of those massive, magical snow-weeks when your entire purpose in life is dedicated to creating the most treacherous, life-threatening sledding courses you can find.  Out of our four hot-spots we headed straight to the ravine, because it had the most Calvin-and-Hobbes-esque sledding potential.  I don’t know if anyone here has ever been to Southeastern Ohio, but we’re right on the edge of the Appalachian foothills, and our ravines are covered in oak and elm trees and pricker bushes.  But the hills were KICK ASS.

This was our last day out before the roads were finally going to be cleared

We had just exited the tree line into one of our neighbor’s yards after seven-hour sledding stint, and I thought I was imagining it when I saw the other fifteen kids with me stop too.  We are talking k-6 kids, and every single one of us stopped talking at the same time.  The wind had been howling all day, and it stopped at the same time as the music began and there was just a little snow falling still.  It was coming from where we had just been behind the tree-line.  And it was definitely music box music.  It wasn’t any song that any of us recognized, either.  It also seemed to be moving and coming from different directions.  

Usually when faced with a mystery like this I would grab my Sherlock Holmes notebook (shut up) and look for clues with my k-12 posse.  This time, I decided to nut up and walk toward where the music seemed to be coming from.  Nobody else came with me and I wasn’t sure if I should freak out yet or not (you know how when little kids fall down and you see them sit there for a second and try to figure out if they should cry or not?  Like that.), so I kept going until I reached the trees.  I stood there for a moment trying to figure out where the sound was coming from.  The song wasn’t familiar, but it wasn’t exactly creepy either.  Then it stopped.  It was replaced with one of those thick silences that makes you run out of a room when you know damn well nothing is there.  You couldn’t hear the snow fall or any of the creaking branches (there had been an ice storm days before so all of the branches were coated in an inch of ice so every time the wind blew you could hear a whole lot of creaking.)  There was just nothing.  I turned around and all of my friends were huddled together looking at me like they were waiting for orders or something.  If I freaked out, they would freak out.  I was wary, but there wasn’t anything legitimately alarming about the situation, so I calmly made my way back to them so we could get some hot chocolate and watch Star Wars. 

Then I fell.  I probably tripped over a branch or something, way harder than it had been blowing before, and these javelin-esque ice-covered branches started falling point down from the trees into the ground all around me.  I’d been hit by those before, and I had no desire to be again so I kept trying to get up and I couldn’t.  The snow was swirling around me and I couldn’t see anything at all.  To make it even more terrifying the music box music started again and seemed to be swirling around in the wind.  I started hearing shouts from my friends and my little sister screaming bloody murder so I just shouted “RUN!” as loud as I could, got myself up, and ran toward them.  They had a good start on me (except for my little sister who apparently thought it was more productive to just stand there and scream), so I grabbed her and yanked her along with me.  The blizzard had started again and we ran until we hit our house.  You have no idea how terrifying it is to try and run in four feet of snow when you don’t even know what you are running from.  You get nowhere fast.

When we got home we were pretty quiet
We talked about it for a little while

Nobody even brought It up again until five years later when my little sister and her friend came screaming in from their walk in “the field”.  (This was the only flat land for miles, but I’m serious.  Their faces were WHITE.  They said that they heard the music again and ran for it before the wind kicked up.  According to my sister, every time they ran the music would be in front of them, blocking their path.  I kind of blew it off because a funnel cloud was rolling in, and those things will scare the hell out of anybody.  There was a tornado that touched down three miles outside of us that evening, and when the storm cleared I turned on the computer because by that time it was 2002 and we had slightly-better-than-dial-up internet service.  That’s when I started looking up music boxes.  I researched for a good six hours before I found it.  I finally found the song that we had heard all those years ago.
Apparently it is called “Hatikva” which was a popular tune for music boxes back in the day:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQgt8cNEPck

The next morning I went out to “the field” to investigate.  There was a lot of rubbish from the tornado, but it sounded like it was coming from the far side of the field so I walked towards it, clearing weeds and fallen branches as I went.  I got about halfway through when I heard it stop.  I don’t know why, but I said, “I know that song.”   There was a healthy breeze going, and it stopped very suddenly like it had last time.  The music started up again, with this weird buzzing under it
I am extremely allergic to bees and I didn’t have my EpiPen on me.  So I had a choice to run through the bees or towards the creepy disembodied music.
I chose bees.  
Luckily the bees’ reaction was slightly delayed so they didn’t start chasing me until I was a good several yards ahead
I have no speculations as to what the hell it was or what was going on

What follows is a short account of what occurred aver a span of about six months back when I was 18-19. From first experiencing the strange events to finishing our seances was about three months, please feel free to share your experiences. It would be nice to be able to converse with someone who experienced what I did over those months, to share that experience. It doesn't feel real a lot of the time. Yeah, all my friends who shared this with me remember it. But they do not like to talk about what happened. 

I still feel troubled concerning these events.

Had a friend with a supposedly haunted house. We would hang out and smoke there, just a bunch of small stuff. We decided to start messing with a Ouija board. 

Came into contact with three separate , and a (for lack of a better word) demon who referred to itself as Zaza. The girl was supposedly raped and murdered by Dick who later killed himself. Both of these entities were supposedly suppressed by Zaza. This led to an increase in the strange activity, in frequency as well as the magnitude of occurrences. 

Objects would move when we left rooms, we heard sounds coming from empty rooms. It started with just three of us messing with the board. We invited several other people over over a period of about 2 months to bear witness to make sure we weren't just crazy. 

Things then started taking a turn for the worse. We would hear growling coming from her added on den. Uncomfortable sensations started plaguing us. We would experience extreme cold to the point where our breath would frost in a climate controlled house. We started having disturbing dreams and having trouble sleeping.

 At the apex of it all

When we called to Dick

When we called to Zaza, started laughing like a crazy person, and the table started shaking without anyone touching it. They said they heard scratching on the underside of it and heard growling coming from nowhere during this time. 

There were many other odd things that happened during the seances that I cannot recall. While I did experience it all firsthand, I was completely lucid and remember clearly. Other times, I would black out, lose 5 minutes or so, then come to, almost like I passed out. And yet, there were times I felt like I was watching myself, or a vivid dream. I was watching myself do things through a fog

But

It had been about ten minutes since we had finished. I had gone outside to smoke a cig and calm down a bit. We then regrouped at our seance table to try one more time a provoke a reaction. We actually weren't joined in our seance circle at this time. I was challenging whatever was there to knock me down, to prove itself. I was standing approximately 5 feet away from a large, heavy dining room table set on a heavy rug. No one was close enough to be able to move it. The table slid the whole distance and hit me hard enough to knock me back, almost knocking me down. We tried moving it ourselves later, and it took a considerable amount of effort to slide it that distance. After that, we were done. 

My friendship with the homeowner quickly died out. I run into her occasionally and we chit chat but that's about it. For a year or so after, etc. I would have to exhaust myself by staying up for 18+ hours, working, and smoking a lot of pot just to be able to fall asleep for maybe 5 hours. And even then, I had really awful nightmares.

1365123353.0,1bpa4a,Living with a guy who fancies himself a Demonologist.,missmaia,75,37,69,"(x-post from /r/nosleep)
---------------------------------------------

Two years ago, and their newborn to help out with bills and keeping the place tidy. I'd known the dad for about a year, now, and he was a fairly interesting guy. He fancied himself a demonologist and capable of dealing with them, banishing them, communicating, et all. I was inclined to believe him after I was at his old house during a banishing ceremony he and a roommate performed to cleanse the house of some shit an ex-roommate brought in when they moved out. After the concluded the ritual, with police investigations finding no sign of breaking and entering

Anyways, so they'd still be asleep when I would get home in the morning. A few weeks in, I came home to a bunch of artwork tacked to my walls. I inquired about it, and the dad (let's call him Jason) said it was his artwork of demons he's encountered. One in particular made me really uncomfortable - it was a black and white striped snake with one really large eye and one arm that had a hand balled into a fist. It just creeped me out.

I would take the picture down and have it returned up in the same spot a few days later

A few months in, and jab the thumbtack back in its place.

Around 11:45 (my roommates were due back at 11), and slam shut. I yell a sarcastic welcome with no response. Footsteps into their room and into the closet-turned-baby room. Over the baby monitor I hear a raspy breathing, the kid fussing, and the device goes dead. From the hallway I hear a thud and the baby starts screaming his head off. I run into his room to see him on the ground next to his crib with welts across his face. I pick him up and hear something in the kitchen.

As I walk from one end of the apartment to the other, and all the faucets are turned on. I hear feedback on both baby monitors and a low gurgle. I turn off the faucets in the bathroom and kitchen, ending at the front door which is still locked it the deadbolt and chain still in place. At this point, the kid starts fussing and squirming, and I notice the blinds to the balcony are rustling. I lock us in my room, grab my rosary, and call my roommates, I notice that fucking picture is on my bed

I moved out the next day.

1363243471.0,1a9slq,[FAM]: Grandma shares a weird story from her past that relates to me in some way,G-zazz,51,11,18,"Someone encouraged me to repost this from Nosleep! It's completely true and is freaking me out a little bit.

So this is a story that my grandmother told me. Some facts you should know before you read this is that my mom and her side of the family is from Chechnya, it's only fair that a person from your family, or yourself would be killed in return (and that's if the person is generous enough to only kill one person rather than your entire family).

My mom told me a story last night that I posted on /r/LetsNotMeet[1] and then proceeded to tell my grandmother to tell me more stories about the things that happened to them in Russia. My grandmother decided to tell me a story that has unnerved all of them to this day.

When my grandmother was a teenager

The people they were friends with were incredibly interesting

""While I have nothing physical to give you"" the woman said, but they will come with the intent to take from you. This will be hard to hear, but you have to let them take whatever they want without any trouble. Let them leave. You will be thankful in the future.""

My grandma's uncle laughed and replied jokingly if he should offer his apartment all together to get the ordeal over with and the woman smiled in return

Before they began to take anything

""Please take what you like"" he smiled ""No hard feelings

The men took what they wanted, a stray blanket and some food and left quietly and gratefully.

One month later, perhaps a stomach virus, but it was something that was best treated by professionals, meaning they needed a doctor. 

Unfortunately, the car (of course) managed to stutter to a halt, leaving my grandma, her sister, her aunt, and her severely ill uncle stranded inside. My grandma was determined to continue onward and decided to run off the road to ask for assistance.

As she trekked through the cold, she discovered that this tavern held only thieves. Literally. They all stole from people and resided here with their loot. I kid you not. 

This was actually a thing in 1950's Russia. Much to my grandma's surprise, she told them the situation and, once again to her surprise, they stated that they had a car and would gladly drive her uncle and aunt to the hospital while her and her sister remained at the tavern to warm up and relax.
These men stayed true to their word and my grandmother's uncle returned safely with her aunt back to the tavern where they befriended the two men that helped them and invited them over formally whenever they had the chance to visit.

it was many years later that my grandma came across the woman who predicted these circumstances. She was old, they hugged and kissed and my grandma once again gave her a gift (probably some poetry books and my grandma's cake because my grandma makes the greatest cake known to mankind). 

Once again

""Your entire family will be filled with success, your daughter especially will be incredibly successful and lead you to a new place to live.

It is there she will give birth to two daughters, with a voice given by God, the youngest will be intelligent beyond her years. Both will have their names become well known, but for very different reasons.

Before she dies
Now that my grandma told me this information

1) My grandpa was simply a math teacher for a very long time before become a Dean in a very well known Russian university.

2) My grandma had three children, all of whom became very successful at their chosen career.

3) My mom's residency in America was one of the reasons my grandma and her family left Russia (another reason being sort of political

4) My mom did give birth to two daughters

I sang at a professional establishment in New York for a few years before quitting, I think the only reason she said it was 'God-given' was because nobody in either side of my family is particularly good at singing which means it wasn't really an inherited trait). My sister ended up getting accepted to a bunch of private middle schools and is all around really successful academically, at least compared to myself, and i'm sort of a B average student. But seriously, she's really smart.

Now, the woman stated that my grandma should tell me that the woman's sorry before I die, meaning that my grandma will still be alive by the time of my death. Another sort of hint that I thought of was the fact that both of our names are going to be known for very different reasons. I mean I'm pretty well known in the athletic circuit, and my sister seems like the type to be pretty famous when it comes to the more academic stuff...but the last sentence makes me think that I might be more well known due to my demise...Meaning that I'm probably going to die pretty young in a pretty awful way I'm assuming.

My grandma didn't want to tell me all of this, but I just need to figure out what this woman meant.

She was right about everything else...what should I do?",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1a9slq/fam_grandma_shares_a_weird_story_from_her_past/

I am not looking for explanations

This first story involves my Grandma Mary in pre-WW2 rural Iowa. She was married and childless at the time.  

**STORY ONE:**
Mary was very close with her husband Charles' sister
One day

When Mary was in the kitchen that night, ""Well Jean!  What are you doing here?  Everyone is looking for you!  Come in and have some coffee with me?""

And then she turns to lead Jean into the house and looks behind her

An hour or so later




**STORY TWO:**
My mother and Grandma Mary are Catholic.  (READ: Very superstitious).  In conversation one day

When Mary died, and then compelled to go to the door to check if there was anyone there.

My mother also recalls not knowing this before

(Can anyone elaborate on that?  What do you know about knocking superstition?)




**STORY THREE:**
About a year after Mary's passing, and older brother Jake are at home.  We're both 1-2 years old at the time.  My brother is in the kitchen playing quietly and my mom leaves the room for a bit, possibly outside or down to the basement or to take a shower.  

When she re-enters the kitchen, did some one call?""
Jake: ""Yes.""
Mom: ""Who was it.?""
Jake: ""Grandma Mary""
And my Mom's heart stops
Jake:  ""Are you being a good boy?""

And I'm not sure what he said




**STORY FOUR:**
When I was four, like if some one was kissing my hand or something.  She laughs at me and asks me what I am doing.  I tell her that ""Grandma Mary is holding my hand.""

1343496663.0,xaz1q,[ME] My Second Night in Okinawa,Vark675,47,9,6,"This was originally posted as a response in an AskReddit thread

The summer between 8th and 9th grade (so I think 2002?), why move one person when we can move like 4 or 5 to cover each other by doing the exact same job?). He was there for about 6 months, and my mom, sister, and I went out to visit him for about 2 of those.

The house we were staying in belonged to the guy who my dad was covering, I believe Marine, and was a very plain, converted concrete Japanese bunker they'd made into a two-story home after the war, slightly elevated to avoid flood water in monsoon season, with fairly small windows.

There were only two bedrooms: the parents, so naturally our parents swiped the kids room, and my sister and I shared the smaller bed. The queen bed was ungodly lumpy and hard, it was literally like they'd stuffed a giant pillow case with sloppily folded t-shirts. After the first night, my sister and I decided against staying in there, and opted to just sleep downstairs on the living room couches.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/xcDDD.jpg) is the layout of the room. There were only 3 possible light sources at night: the TV, and the hallway/front door and the large back wall had no windows.

The first night down there, and it got really annoying, but I pretended I was asleep so she wouldn't start talking to me. On one particular occasion, she stood there for a really long time, so I peeked open one eye, but couldn't see her unless I got up, and I wasn't willing to risk a conversation at shit o'clock in the morning. I did notice the shadows along the wall with the window though. 

They were moving quickly, until I realized that there were no cars driving by, because I would've been able to hear them. I sat up and put my glasses on, and that's when I realized a couple of things.

1) The wall they were on was not a part of the wall that should have shadows. One light source would make shadows on the wall exactly opposite

2) They were silhouettes of people. With helmets and bayoneted rifles. 

3) My mom didn't bring her slippers on this trip

I had no idea what to do

I laid down

The next morning, then thought to ask why. Turns out she'd seen and heard everything I had. Neither of us had wanted to freak the other out, so we kept it to ourselves and didn't wake the other up.",,False,,t5_2sntx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xaz1q/me_my_second_night_in_okinawa/
1341509646.0,w32oi,How Is That Possible?! [ME] [FAM] [PIC],sunshine654789,49,8,36,"I had posted a while ago and thought I'd add some more of my stories. These are all 100% true. If you haven't read my first post [Why I Don't Like Hallways](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/j06ph/why_i_dont_like_hallways/) please read that first. I attached some photos I made as a visual aid. They aren't great but hopefully they do the job. Either way I hope you enjoy.

Picking up where I had left off I had just witnessed something that would later develop into a life of co-existing with the paranormal. My mother always claimed that she, see things, hear things that other people in my family either can’t or just tune out. My mother personally thinks my house is a portal of sorts, because we never see the same thing twice. She thinks that it is in all places my back room closet, which always had a weird vibe to it. But, I think it comes from the attic and lingers in the hallway. We all hate the hallway. 

There was a time when we first moved in that my mother insisted that we sleep with our doors open. The air gets stale when the doors are constantly kept closed. We would get awoken in the middle of the night by weird noises, but we could live with that. Yet, this one night she awoke lying on her side to a face staring at her not even 6 inches from her. She rolled over and ignored it. Ever since that night she insisted that we sleep with the doors closed. She believes that the open doors invite them into our rooms at night. After shutting the doors at night not much happens other than hearing people walk past your door at night. At least they are courteous enough to appreciate our privacy. 

The next occurrence I remember was when my brother was about 6 years old. He constantly complained about this pirate that would bother him at night. We thought he was having a bad dream or something. I don’t know why he chose to describe it as a pirate. I am assuming it was because the apparition had a hat. Well,” followed by a prayer. They then went down to our living room to watch some TV, but really what is on at 3am? My mom said that after being down on the couch for less than 10 minutes there was this light out of his room. They both described it as a bright light that aluminate from his bedroom and moved into the hallway, but the light didn’t cast down the stairs it just stayed in the hallway. Moments later the light just faded, rather disappeared. My mom told the confused 6 year-old that it was just the flashlight from a paperboy. What are you to tell a kid? 

Fast forward a few uneventful years my mother had a difficult time sleeping one night. She often found comfort in the downstairs recliners. The one she laid her head in that night happened to face the base of the stairwell. Well she awoke in the middle of the night to once again find something staring at her. They weren’t so aggressive this time. They stood at the base of the stairwell and watched her as she slept. She described them as an Amish couple. She hoped if she closed her eyes and ignored them they would go away, she wasn’t driving one. She ran a daycare (mentioned in my last post) and as she was going through the back door into the yard one of the kids she cared for pretty much ran her over with one, causing her to hit the concrete patio and dislocate her shoulder. She thinks they were trying to give her a warning. Which I believe because it happened to me with the shadow man I mentioned in the first post. I don’t think mentioned this but a few days after seeing him I took my skooter out for a ride (without a helmet because helmets are for losers) and scraped my face up pretty bad. My classmates called me Freddy Kruger for a while to give you an idea of what it looked like. It seemed like whenever something bad was about to happen we saw something. 

Next thing I remember that was really strange and I have no explanation for happened when I was 15. Here's a [layout](http://imgur.com/SGr7B, if my understanding of gravity and physics is correct the fixture should have fallen pretty much straight down and hit me on the head. Instead, it happened to fly almost 4 feet down the hall and crash right in front of my bedroom door (which is My Brother's room in the picture), shattering into pieces. I still have no rhyme or reason why or how that could have happened. Funny thing is that we put up a new fixture and it fell down again. We haven’t put up a new one since. 
After that incidence I moved from my old room to my new room. I like this room despite the stuff my brother saw in here. At least the door won’t swing open on me anymore. Whenever there was any wind the door would slam shut. Occasionally the door would pop open if it wasn’t securely shut and someone walked passed it. By popping open I mean maybe an inch if that. Well one night I was awoken in the middle of the night by my door being swung wide open and hard enough that it hit the wall and bounced back. I hurried out of bed, you need to leave.” That always seemed to work for whatever reason. 

Things were pretty quiet for the last few years until just recently. I would say the past year or so. One night I was in my room working on some calculus problems when I hear a soft knock at the door. 
Knock
“Yes? Come in.”
No answer. I thought it must have been my imagination.  A few moments later:
Knock
“Yes
Again
Knock
This time I swing the door open to nothing. I call to my parents and ask if they had been calling for me, well, noisy and violent. I then heard the floorboards creek. If that wasn’t bad enough I felt the being sit on my bed and touch my leg though the blanket. It was there for a few minutes before I felt it get back up and heard it walk into the back room again.

The last thing that happened in my room was so mind boggling. I’ve tried debunking it and have come up empty handed. My daily routine at the time was to get up,dfJOl,ro9Tc#1) is what was on my desk when I went downstairs, and [this](http://imgur.com/SGr7B,dfJOl,ro9Tc#2) is what I returned to. This blows my mind. I mean I was able to get the glass to lean like that but it takes a bit to make it balance like so. There is NO way that I bumped it by chance and it landed that way. Let alone for the water to form like that. My parents said my brother was playing a prank on me, but he was still asleep at the time and I was the only other one home. I tried dumping water on my desk and I cannot get it to do that. It’s just not humanly possible.

More recently we have been having things occurring in our kitchen which is directly below my bedroom. We have done some renovation and I know that can stir up things. While we were renovating

 One afternoon I came home after classes and sat down to have lunch. My brother was home as well. As I was sitting there a noise caught my attention. It was faint at first but became more defined. It was scratching. It sounded like something scratching the inside one of the kitchen cabinets. My first thought is “oh my god, per cabinet. I call my boyfriend back into the room. It stops again. Now it’s just playing games with me. I was begging for him to believe me when it started up again for a moment and ended just as quickly. He heard it because as he was talking to me he perked his head up and was looking in the direction of noise. My dad got home and went through every cabinet and found no signs of anything. No scratch marks, no holes, no droppings, and nothing inside the cabinets were disturbed. It’s just something else that I can’t explain. It was just the other day that my mother heard something coming from the closet in the kitchen and she called for my father. The moment he walked into the room it stopped.

I think this is enough for now. Feel free to debunk. I am sorry that the pictures provided aren't all that great. These things happened years ago and I have no real photos to support my claims. I will put other experiences that my family and I have had in another post. Hope you enjoy my little rant. If you have any explanations for anything I'm happy to listen.

* My mom started dating around 5 months ago, all the fire alarms went off in the house.  My mom woke up about 3 minutes before all this happened to my cat howling and pots and glasses clanking in the kitchen. We have a pot rack and a glass rack so its like they were moved by something in the kitchen.  This happened several nights and several other times when each of us (mom, sister, me) have been home alone. 

* I also live with a two year old,"" or sometimes he will say ""Someone is here.""  One day, my mom was in her room and my sister (his mother) was watching him and went upstairs to get laundry and found him locked outside. She questioned my mom about it, who hadn't moved from her spot. All of the doors in the house were deadbolted and my nephew was out on the front sidewalk.

* Recently, on the second floor, it sounds like someone is starting from the bottom of the stairs and ending up on the landing in front of my room, then back down again. We also hear doors opening and sometimes closing randomly.

* A couple weeks ago, which he was very fond of. The guy buying the equipment was freaked out because there were (I guess) over 100 dragonflies circling the area.  It was pretty amazing to see.

* Doors have started opening and slamming randomly.  Most notably in my room.  I've been woken by my bathroom door slamming shut in the middle of the night.  A few weeks ago, but no one was home but me and the cats were outside.  

* Our kitchen and living room are attached

Now, there was just one other girl, who I'll call Rachel and maybe 3 guys. The first week passed without major incident, and another girl arrived, who I'll call Julie, who became my first roommate. 

We started hearing loud bangs on the walls at night. Not just normal sounds a old building would make, expecting to see her screwing around with us. She was the opposite side of the room from our shared wall, changing and obviously not banging on any walls. 

Then stuff started moving. It got to the point where we would make sure all the doors (which where solid and heavy and would NOT move on their own) where firmly close and would note where everything in the room was. Without fail, and stuff would be moved around even though there was absolutely no way anyone had been in our room. It was around this time we would start to see things move. While we were in our room, the blinds would start being moved up and down and generally look like a hand was swiping against them, the doors would slam, the drawers would open and close by themselves, and the pounding continued. One really bad night, in my closet we heard the sound of hangers hitting each other, my clothes were in a heap on the ground and the hangers were scattered. 

The pictures in our room (basically motivational pictures on the walls of all the rooms) started being turned upside down. One day when Julie and I were sitting in the girls group room (which shared a wall with our bedroom) while Rachel was with her counselor. All of a sudden we could hear, absolutely NO MP3 players or phones were allowed, and the RA on our floor wasn't playing any music. We walked to our room, and I swear, the moment we swung our door opened the music and voices just stopped. 

In this week we gained a few more girls, stupid of us) and this is when everything escalated. We turned off all the lights and started. Instantly, a cold rush went through the room, and a loud whisper we couldn't understand came from directly behind us. We instantly NOPE'D out and an RA confiscated our homemade board. 

One day, when the door slammed closed, with a huge force that shook the walls. Thankfully nothing happened to me but it was still a scare. One day during cleaning day, we split up our cleaning tasks and I went to go fill up the mop bucket in the handicapped room's bathroom. This room had its own fair share of creepy experiences, the two girls in the there actually saw their clothes (this room had no closet door) swinging in perfect synch one night when hanging up, along with other things similar to mine and Julie's experiences. When I walked in, the open closet was on my right and I could clearly see a person standing there, assuming it was one of the girls but it annoyed me because both of them were supposed to be in the group room

Around this time, then disappear. I got other random marks on my arms and back.

At this point we all got scared. One night 2 out of the 3 rooms somehow got a strange mark on the wall that was clear and had not been there before. The imprint was a demon's face, more than before, and my door slammed shut. My nightstand next to my head began violently shaking, and fed up, I yelled at it to go away. It all stopped and everything was quiet for about a minute, then from the other side of the hall, on the boy's side, Daniel and Greg

Apparently while they were both in bed, the other a formerly #1 heavy lifting champ in our state, a no-nonsense country boy, definitely not what you would consider cowards) were so scared they refused to sleep in that room and demanded they were moved someplace else. They had been hearing and seeing other things and this was on the straw that broke the camel's back. Even when a RA from another unit began teasing them, they didn't budge. After that, the boys side began experiencing more activity, probably because I wasn't taking anymore shit from the paranormal side.

Only one more thing happened before I was discharged and it still gives me goosebumps to this day. Though the banging and stuff moving still happened, at probably around 4am I woke up for no reason. I was in the bed closest to our doors and Tonya slept on the bed on the other side of the room, next to the window. Clear as day, I saw a tall, dark man next to the closet across from her bed, just standing. As I watched, he slowly walked to Tonya's bed, watching as she slept. Fed up at this point

We're just chatting and out of no where, and she says, ""well, I dreamed that a shadowy man was standing over my bed, watching me."" At this point my stomach dropped and I told her what I had seen. We both described the man the exact same. About 6'0, unclear facial features, broad and wearing some sort of suit. 

I was finally discharged from that place just a day or two earlier and I've never felt as much relief as I did when I stepped out of that place. For all that it helped me, one night a terrifying chain of events happened before I was there that makes what I experienced a walk in the roses. I was told things I shouldn't have by my counselor and she confirmed that it did happen, but I'll save that story for another time because I feel this post has gotten way to long already!

My friend also thought he heard something so I went up stairs to investigate sense my parents were not to be home for a while. Once I reached the upstairs I yelled out ""Maaooom???"" ""Daaaaad???"" nothing. I checked the garage, we went back to our game.

 Our activities would pause and we look at each other as we would think we where hearing things again, checked the garage again, yelled out mom, and dad again, and still nothing. 

We both at that point did the ""are you messing with me?"" thing running through the possibility's it was one of our friends trying to freak us out. As we are hypothesizing on who it could be we begin to search the area. We went out into garage, from the time we heard the noise to the time we searched upstairs we thought for sure we would see some one.

 After we exit the garage we circled the house, from the house to the garage(the one I had just shut) was wide open. At this point I remembered about the a mentally handicap child in the neighborhood who had on a couple occasions wandered into peoples houses. Thinking that had to be it, I walked inside yelling out to anyone who might be in the house. We then heard a banging sound coming from the 3rd story of the house. 

The 3rd story had a landing where all the bedroom doors are visible from the main floor. Looking up we could hear whatever it was inside my bedroom. Still thinking it might be this kid, I hear a rush of movement on my desk, and as if someone had their palm on the stack of papers, and flinging them outwards the paper fly's in the air like large confetti.

1370505198.0,1fs1or,[Crosspost] From a comment I made in r/askreddit about paranormal experiences. I used to live with a shadowman.,Indubitableness,51,15,28,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fs0gb/people_of_reddit_when_have_you_had_a_paranormal/cad82xz)

I used to live in a house with a shadow man.

When I first moved in there everyone told me the place was haunted. Being a skeptic

The first time I experienced something strange involved handprints in my pillow. I didn't have the kinds of pillows that will take an impression easily

I wiped the pillow expecting the hand prints to go away, and saw my hands were much larger than the hand prints. After wiping them away and watching them return several times I started thinking ""Okay, this is not normal."" After about ten minutes of observing these persistent hand prints they suddenly faded away and were gone. It was very much like someone was pressing invisible hands into the pillow for a while.

Still a skeptic

We had an alarm on the house that would beep three times anytime a door was opened. One day my roommates left for the day. ""Beep beep beep.""

I'm sitting on my bed reading, rather, had a crawlspace beneath the house. This made it so you could feel and hear every single footstep a person took through the floor unless they were being particularly quiet. I began feeling footsteps and hearing them. I kept seeing a shadow move across my peripheral vision in and out of my roommates' bedroom.

I was busy reading and just assumed my roommates had come home early. The shadow kept crossing though and suddenly two things registered in my mind. The ""beep beep beep"" of my roommates returning never happened

I stop reading and stare at the door. I can still feel and hear the footsteps in the house. You get to where you can tell which room and which part of a room a person is in based on their footsteps. Someone is walking around in the living room. I see the shadow cross two more times, and lingers.

Now here's where everyone who told me the house was haunted would freak out and run away

As I entered the living room the shadowman started moving towards the kitchen. I could feel and hear the footsteps as I followed him. As I follow him I make an observation that he is a single

As he passes through the door into the kitchen he disappears, a sound it makes every single time you close it. It was already closed.

That was my first encounter with the shadow man. He appeared to me several times since and I would always follow him and see how long I could keep him in my field of vision. Sometimes you would see physical objects move before you saw him. I can't say the two are directly related as objects moving on their own were not always accompanied by the shadowman's visual presence. Others have mentioned seeing a woman in the house. I never saw her but enough people have confirmed it that, as well, and it was often a lot less climactic with multiple people around. We'd just say ""Well, you've just seen the shadowman.""

A friend of mine has a story from the house that I wasn't there for. Him and my roommate and her friend were sitting around and he didn't believe the place was haunted. To test it he began talking mad shit about ""the ghost."" Really vitriolic stuff

At that point the metal splash shield behind the stove and all the pots and pans that were sitting on the stove flew across the room and clattered across the floor violently.

Even having chased the shadowman around the house on multiple occasions I would not have believed this story without three witnesses confirming it

I could go on about strange occurrences in that house but I've already accrued a wall of text.

TL;DR: Didn't believe I lived in a haunted house until I saw plenty of evidence.

1365303861.0,1bu0gk,I Grew Up With a Creepy Basement.,LolosterGoldfish,46,8,8,"I thought I would share some of my experiences. So here it goes.

My family moved into the house that I grew up in when I was 5 years old. The house was a two-story with a basement. I never felt 100% safe in that house. Specifically I felt very uncomfortable and ""not safe"" in the basement and in my bedroom. The rest of the house didn't bother me. Now, except for the workroom which did have a door. 

Also

The first experience I had was when I was about 12 years old. My best friend (BF) and I were home alone while my parents were at my grandparents house. They only lived a few houses away and my parents just told us to not leave the house while they were gone. All of the doors to my house were locked, no one called the phone while my parents were gone (so the answering machine couldn't have been tripped). Now despite being scared of the basement, most of the time when friends came over we would either spend time outside or in the basement because my parents were less likely to bug us while we were there and up until this point nothing had ever actually happened to scare me in the basement. So BF and I were spending time in Area 3 (on the side closer to Area 1). I went up to the 2nd story to go retrieve something from my room while BF stayed where she was. While I was up there I heard a muffled man's voice yelling ""ANYBODY HOME??"" BF let out a shriek and ran up to the first floor and at this point I was running downstairs to meet her there screaming her name to make sure she was ok. We checked around the first floor, but like I said, the doors were locked, windows shut/locked, tv/radios off, like I said, but my parents thought we were making it up.

Needless to say, but we did). I tried to avoid it but she looked at me sternly and told me to go do it. So I went downstairs (to Area 1), found the cabinet, put the scale away, and turned around to see my dad in Area 2 near the border of Area 1 right at where the stairs start. I asked him if he would mind turning off the lights since I was just headed back upstairs. He told me it would be no problem and then headed back towards his workroom. I went upstairs and thought nothing of it until later that day, my dad started yelling at me because I didn't turn off the lights in the basement. I then said ""But I asked if you would do it when you were down there and you said you would!"" My dad replied that he hadn't been in the basement at all that day until just then and he had no idea what I was talking about.

Those are the two big things that happened in that house. Once I went off to college and came home for the summer after my first year I felt very nervous and uncomfortable in my room again and I slept on the couch in the living room for a month. The only reason I went back to sleeping in my room that summer was because my grandma was visiting (they no longer had a house nearby) and she was staying in my room and I didn't want her to be in there by herself. My parents divorced and got rid of the house not too long after this.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1bu0gk/i_grew_up_with_a_creepy_basement/

As my dad told it

So, I had a couple of experiences that rattled me.

One night in the early hours, forbidding it from harming me. During this, I did not feel scared. 

A couple of years later when I was about 19, balding man with a moustache sitting at the end of my bed. He was quite skinny and wearing a string vest with brown trousers and over-shoulder suspenders. He said nothing, but as I sat up to switch the light on he disappeared. I didn't feel scared at all, just puzzled and if anything, curious to know who he was. I didn't see the man again but we would always hear foot steps up and down the stairs and knocks on our respective doors, with no one on the other side.

In case you haven't seen the show it is a documentary-drama series that tells the true-life stories of people who've had inexplicable and/or scary experiences. A key feature of the show is that there are multiple (at least 3) witnesses to the events or to the effects the events have had. There is no narrator; these individuals tell their story to the camera and dramatic reconstructions bring it to life.

We're looking for more TRUE stories that will sustain for 43 minutes and which have some kind of escalation - things starting off small and building until there is some kind of resolution. We need people who are happy to be filmed and who are credible (no offense intended here).

I was with a couple of friends one night (D and Vince) when my friend Steph calls my friend D asking him if we can go keep her company while she's house sitting.  We talked it over and decided we had nothing better to do, we eat some food, and then decided we were going to watch some movies.  We all sit down and go through one movie before putting in a second one and falling asleep halfway through.  Steph wakes up and gets up to go to sleep in the guest room (which is her assigned room while she's house sitting) and accidentally wakes me up while she's collecting her blankets to go to the room.  She notices that I've woken up and so she asks if I want her to turn the television off, my friend Vince then wakes up who is sitting on my left (D is on my right and all three of us are on the same couch) so I ask him what he thinks and he says he doesn't care, so I tell her to leave it on.  I don't remember what me and Vince decided we were going to watch but whatever it was, we fell asleep in the middle of it and when I woke up again, the television was displaying static without the white noise.  I sat there for a bit not able to fall back asleep and not really wanting to get up and turn the television off because I was cold, when I heard it.  I heard someone walking through the dining room (which was on the left of us through a big archway) from the direction of the bedrooms towards the kitchen.  I slightly turned my head to my left to see if I could see Steph since she was the only other person in the house, so my last rational thought was that it was the cat, when I saw the blanket lift over his head and Vince's face look over at me looking terrified while shaking his head as if to say ""this is not f***ing happening!"".  As we sat there

We told D what had happened, she told us that she'd had similar experiences in that house and that was one of the reasons she wanted us to keep her company that night.  D told her that it would have been nice if she had told us ahead of time, and she just kind of laughed like she was embarrassed and then apologized, agreeing that she probably should have said something about it.

I groggily got up, took them back into their room right down the hall (the laundry room which has the door blocked by those little pet gates that fit in the doorway), and went back to bed.

Well, and then I turn my head to the side and look at the wall and think about what I want for breakfast. I look back only a few seconds later and the clock suddenly says 12:00 PM.

I didn't fall asleep, but obviously there wasn't much to say about it.

So I was fixing my food and I asked them why one of them got up at 7:00 AM and let the dogs into my room to wake me up on a Saturday. They both looked at me a little weird and said they didn't let the dogs out of their room and that they weren't even up at that time. It was then that I also remembered a very important fact: I sleep with my door shut. So somehow, I noticed the doggie door gate was lying against the wall to the right of the door frame, it wasn't like the dogs busted it down somehow (which they have never done or attempted to do before or now).

I know it's easy to say ""well of course it was your parents, and she is NOT a morning person. She just doesn't wake up at 7:00 or close to it.

This is one of the earliest memories I had. When I was a small boy

Anyway, with dark hair. He asked me if I wanted to play and I said yes. I was lonely and didn't know when my dad would be done. So the boy and I started chasing each other around the yard.

I distinctly remember that there were times when the boy seemed to just disappear. I would turn a corner immediately after him and he would be gone. All of a sudden he would pop up behind me. Keep in mind this was a well manicured yard with very few places to hide.

Eventually, the boy would pop up and laugh, and then disappear behind the bed again. At this point, I was making quite a mess in the room but didn't seem to care because I was having an insane amount of fun. I also really, really wanted to hit the boy with something. At least, that's how it seemed.

There was a grey doll house in the room. It was beautiful and ornate

Well, she asked ""What boy?""

Now this was a small bedroom and I had this kid cornered. There was no way for him to get out of there with out my noticing. And when my dad and his friend came in, everywhere. The boy wasn't there. 

This lady demanded that my father leave. I couldn't blame her. I had just destroyed her place. I'll never understand why I felt the need to hit this kid just that I was overwhelmed with the sensation that it was the right thing to do at the time. Now, and only recently has it begun to sink in that this whole experience was quite possibly paranormal. I do believe that as children we are more susceptible to these kinds of events. Was this boy a ghost that wanted to get me in trouble for some reason? I don't think I'll ever know the answer to that.

But I have to say this experience creeped me out like no other. 

It was pretty early in the morning. My stepdad was at work already and my mom was still passed out cold in her room. I was listening to music and browsing reddit actually when my little sisters (Cate and Claire) came in my room scared shitless. They made me jump for sure because I was in a total state of bliss I guess you could say. Cate was crying and Claire was trying to explain to me what happened. Apparently the dogs were barking so Cate went downstairs to let them outside. She then tells me that when she almost got off the stairs she saw a shadow-like appariton move down the hallway. What's freaky is Cate said that she heard the thing whispering before disappearing in the other room. Before she ran upstairs

 Not fully convinced, ""In the name of Jesus Christ leave me alone!"". Funny thing to be doing at 8 o' clock in the morning if you want my honest opinion. But when we got downstairs it felt different. I felt on edge the entire time because I'm wondering if someone is in the house that could hurt us or if it's something supernatural. Every room we'd go into I'd get the growing feeling we weren't alone, like we're being watched. I still wonder if it was just my nerves or something else. So after we searched the house we ended up going down the same hallway Cate saw the thing and there on the table was a lit candle. I asked my sisters if they've been messing with my lighters and they said no. They looked just as surprised as I was.

These are several experiences dealt with by my whole family.
I'll start with my mom.

When we first moved into my house my mom and her friend decided to take the kids to the beach for the day. They left all day and when they came back the neighbors told them the police were at our house and there was also a note on the door saying to call the police. My mom calls and asks what's going on? They proceed to tell her that a young girl called 911 and said there was a murder going on in the house. The police rushed over looked through all the windows couldn't see anything and left a note(I don't know why they just didn't break into the house but it was over 20 yrs ago so I don't know

A few years past and I'm about 3 at this point. The upstairs of the house was being renovated and everyone was sleeping on the main floor in the living as it wasn't safe upstairs and my parents had all little kids. My mom goes out one night with a friend and when they get home my mom's friend notices that I'm in the upstairs window pressed up completely against the window. My mom absolutely freaks out and thinks I'm going to fall through. She tells her friend to wait under the window and she's going to run in and get me. She comes inside goes to go upstairs and I'm sleeping on the couch. She walks back outside looks up at the window with her friend and both of them watch as my face slowly turns into a skeleton then completely disappears.

My two brothers and uncle(I have a very young uncle that is close in age with all of us) lived in the huge basement at the time. My parents turned it into one big bedroom and they all stayed down there. They normally didn't have any problems but one night they said they were just spooked for no reason. Everyone was feeling sick that day and it was just off. They went to bed that night and in the middle of the night woke up to a little girl down in the basement telling them to leave. My brothers and uncle absolutely freaked out and ran upstairs, he owned a landscape business and was outside all day, he realized something was wrong. Calls the gas company and they send someone out. Turns out we had a carbon monoxide leak and it was so bad the guy told my parents that if anyone had stayed in the basement all night they would have died.

The Station Supervisor went down to the eastbound tunnel and looked in it and all around the immediate area but could find no trace of the man in the white overalls.

The Station Supervisor assured him that he had conducted a very thorough check of the area and that there was definitely no-one down there. He even asked my father whether the image of the man could have been the result of a “blip” on the CCTV system but

The Station Supervisor went and conducted another search of the area but the result was the same as the first. He could not find any trace of the man in the tunnel or in the immediate vicinity of the tunnel. 

He returned to the telephone at the foot of the escalator, that as he watched the second search of the area on his TV screen being conducted he had clearly seen the man in white overalls standing within touching distance of the Station Supervisor and walking after him when he left.

Dad thanked him for carrying out the searches and rang off. As the Station Supervisor turned and walked back onto the eastbound platform he noticed to his left a bench and on that bench was there was a pair of white paper overalls. 

The Station Supervisor was certain that if anyone had walked out of the tunnel whilst he had been on the telephone he would have seen them and he would also have seen anyone leaving the overalls on the platform bench.

It was two years ago that I lay in bed with my wife lying sleeping beside me (I tell you now that we are both believers in aliens but not prone to exaggeration or hysteria over the subject - we are both University Graduates and professional people). Anyway

I have no idea what it stabbed me with - but it felt like a hypodermic needle- I felt it go through my ribs and into the mid section of my left lung. It then stood upright on the bed again and rushed quickly out the door. As I gathered my senses I woke my wife who said she heard nothing, made coffee and wondered if I was going nuts but the feeling where it 'stabbed me' absolutely convinced me this was real - I was certain it was nothing 'demonic' or a product of my imagination - I absolutely believed right there and then that a 'little alien' had climbed up on my bed and the little *okker stabbed me.

I wrote to a friend by e-mail the following morning detailing what had happened and then spent weeks trying to talk myself out of believing what had happened.

6 weeks later I collapsed with severe chest pains and was rushed by ambulance to ER with a suspected heart attack. Fortunately it wasn't - but I was told that had I not collapsed then in another 24 hours I would have been dead - I had a massive pneumonia in the mid section of my left lung. It was so bad I was in hospital for a couple of weeks and it was only when I got out that my friend contacted me to remind me of the e-mail I sent her detailing the puncturing of my left lung by a little 'alien'.

1343617376.0,xdepx,Whispers in the Night (x-post from r/nosleep comment).,74294729874,42,7,6,"*For clarification

About a year ago I was suffering from terrible insomnia, cranky, etc. but that was it. *I think it's also worth mentioning that I've never experienced any type of sleep paralysis or hallucination from sleep deprivation (I have a long history of insomnia).* So I stayed up most nights. Usually I'd just lay in bed with the lights off, trying desperately to fall asleep. But, much to my dismay, it never worked. I tried all of the textbook relaxation techniques, took melatonin, but nothing ever came of it.

Then the whispering started. It was faint at first, hoped, it was someone in the house playing a trick on me, perhaps my brother getting back at me for a prank I'd pulled. I'd even considered that I was in some weird half-sleep state and had started imagining things. But I couldn't understand why, only now, had I started hearing things? I told myself again and again that it must have been the everyday noises of an old house. But once it sounded as though the whispers were coming from right next to me, I knew something was wrong. Each time it happened I would turn to see where the sound was coming from

I didn't know what to think. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone for fear of being made fun of, but I dealt with it. Being raised in a Catholic family, the last thing I wanted to do was even hint at the *possibility* that there was a demon in the house. I didn't know what kind of reaction I would get.

This went on for a few weeks, as usual, but this time the thing was so close that I could feel its breath on the back of my neck. I flipped over and turned on every light in my room faster than I thought possible. Once again, there was nothing there. I sat curled up in a ball up against my wall until sunlight, refusing to sleep again until I had found some resolution.

That day I walked several miles to the church I was raised in (but hadn't been to in years--I considered myself an atheist at this point). I was desperate, so I knew I could divulge this secret without fear of being judged. 

I told him I must have sinned greatly by denouncing my faith and the church, and all the color left his face. In the 17 years I had known him, never once had I seen this jolly old Irishman without a loving smile on his face, and at that moment he had the most grave expression I have seen to this day. At that point I started to cry, scared for my life and the well-being of my family. I thought God hated me and had abandoned my soul to be tormented by the Devil. But what Father Tom said to me next has never left my mind: ""Child, you are in danger. There is something in that house that wants to claim you, to take you from God and from this world. You're right to be frightened. These beings want nothing but evil, in the eyes and heart of whatever God you believe in. The only power this creature has over you is that which you give it. Fear is what drives them

He disappeared into one of the back rooms of the church and returned with a small box. When I opened it I found the most beautiful rosary of glass beads and silver that I had ever seen. He said, ""I'll pray for you tonight, and be sure to come back and let me know if you need any more help."" He blessed me, and I returned home.

I keep that rosary hung on the wall above my bed

Make of this what you will. Maybe it was just my imagination and the whispers stopped because I believed they would. Maybe I'm crazy and paranoid. Maybe my mind was simply playing tricks on me...but maybe not. I'm certainly not about to start asking questions. All I know is the whispers are gone. And that's how I intend to keep it.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xdepx/whispers_in_the_night_xpost_from_rnosleep_comment/

1342448550.0,wn7bd,Old Hag Syndrome,tmcd83,38,4,23,"For almost 20 years I've suffered with a form of sleep paralysis.
Its not something that is a regular occurrence but when it happens once then it tends to stay with me for a couple weeks.
When it happens its in the middle of the night. I get woken up and all is normal until I realise I can hardly breath, just grunts.
I'm fully awake and can see and hear everything around me.
The paralysis will last anything from a few seconds to over a minute. I know that doesn't sound long but trust me being pinned in one position unable to move or breath is terrifying. 
I found out that if I'm able to move one body part then the spell is broken and I can move and breath fine. So I tend to focus on on body part
After one of these episodes I need to get out of bed and stretch. If I dont do this then I slip back into paralysis again. This is actual worse than waking up paralysed because I can feel my chest tightening and my body start to shake until I'm back under and unable to move.
I did look into it online to see if it was some kind of common condition and came across something called 'Old Hag Syndrome'. This is described in exactly the same way that I've stated above except that a lot of other people that experience it also see an old woman in the room that makes her way slowly towards the paralysed person before climbing on top and crushing their chest.
Now I never experienced anything like this or anything that I couldn't explain. That was until two nights ago when I had another episode.
It was around 4am when I woke up. I don't know what woke me but I was wide awake. I tried to turn my head to see if maybe my cat had jumped up on the bed but I was unable to move. That's when I felt my chest getting heavy.
I knew what I had to do and I focused all my energy on kicking my leg. That's when I heard it.
I live in a two storey house and the stairs to the second floor run next to my bedroom. I heard the door downstairs open
A few seconds after I heard the door open I heard a footstep on the first step and then another step and another. It sounded slow to me
I hoped that this was my wife (shes not elderly!)
The footsteps continued very slowly until I heard the floorboard creak outside the bedroom door.
The bedroom door is also quite stiff but I heard it push open.
My cat in the bedroom started to chatter softly
I couldn't see what opened the door because my back was to it and I was unable to move.
I started to panic now and tried desperately to make a noise or kick out to alert my wife that something was wrong. I felt like I was in a suit made of lead. Everything was to heavy and was taking a lot out of me.
I could then hear footsteps making its way slowly around the room towards my side of the bed. My cat is now hissing and letting out a very low growl.
I can see a slight shadow pass the window close to my bed
That's when I was able to shout out and wake up my wife. Everything went back to normal in the room except that I was covered in sweat and gasping for breath.
I tried to explain it to my wife but she explained it away by saying it was a nightmare. She has never had a problem with sleep and when I try and explain it to her she doesn't quite understand.
She couldn't explain why both the bedroom door and lounge door were open though. Or why our cat was cowering under the bed
Everything I said above is 100% true. This was the first time that anything unexplained happened to me during one of these episodes and I hope to never have to go through it again.

When I was about 6 I had something odd happen. I had been playing with my Star Wars figures and could not find the hat for my Lando Calrissian figure (first world problem right there!).

I was really upset and unhappy about this because I had only recently got that figure.

I lived with my grand parents and that evening we all got in the car to go and visit my Mum who had just moved into a new house. I didnt really see my Mum at all so this was exciting. So we get to this house that I have never been to before and like any normal kid

Looking around the garden, I noticed one of the stone bricks under the step was loose.

So, aware that spiders may well be lurking and my hand touches something small and round which I grab.

I open my hand and there it is. A perfectly new Lando Calrissian hat just like the one I had been looking for all day

I've only had one paranormal experience that in my entire life that I remember. Here we go.

There is one memory I have as a child that really sticks out to me the most. While I understand that memories can get slightly skewed over the years

I was around 5 years old and I shared a bedroom with my triplet sisters, and 1 that looked out over our back yard.  Our backyard is fairly large, fenced in, and completely surrounded by pine trees, but  behind it lies a big soybean field. 

I couldn't tell you what time it was
But

Our bedroom was on the ground floor

What we see hoovering over the yard is fucking huge

It quite honestly looked like your classic UFO saucer shape, except 100 times bigger and just so bright.  I don't even remember being scared, I remember being amazed and how it reminded me of a giant Litebrite in the sky. Fuck, you guys, Litebrites were the shit.


Along with the colored lights flashing all around it, back and forth, but never quite following the same path. Sometimes it would dip just a little lower, or a little higher. Or go just a tiny bit further to the left, or a tiny bit further to the right, but remained in the same general area. It stayed there until the realization both hit us that this wasn't normal.

We ran into our parents bedrooms

Now, and got a little scared whenever I brought it up. Today, she says she doesn't remember it at all, which honestly I don't understand, because it's so fresh and clear in my head.

The fact that all the sudden she ""doesn't remember"" is the only part that makes me worried that I've had this very real story in my head that I've been telling friends about for years and years that isn't even true, and I genuinely believe that I *did* see *something*, but let me know what ya'll think.

After a couple weeks of lurking here, I’ve been to nearly a dozen abandoned hospitals along the East Coast, and I’ve have never seen or felt anything spooky there, even when I explored old morgues or when the particular hospital had a well-documented history of its patients having suffered or undergone abuse. The only place I’ve been scared like this is my family home.

For me, she slept over with me in the upstairs guest bedroom when no one else was home. In complete darkness, I awoke to the sound of screaming. I had been dreaming (?) that I had been conversing with the voice of an elderly woman, and as we continued to speak, the woman’s voice had become increasingly menacing. When I first heard the screams, I associated them with the old woman and was terrified. As my surroundings began to become clearer to me, I began to understand that the screaming was coming from my girlfriend beside me. I nudged her and repeatedly identified myself to her to try to get her to stop. I then made a blind dash for the light switch and turned on the ceiling light. We stared at each other in fear. She started to say something, that I felt I needed to limit all our sound and movement until I could figure out what and where the other presence could be. Another wave of fear came over me as the crazy thought crossed my mind that the presence could have entered her. I wasn’t ready to trust her until I could see nothing was going to happen. After what seemed like an endless silence

Looking back on my time with (T), I got the strange feeling that something nefarious was making its way to me from a long way away. I hadn’t experienced that feeling before, and I haven’t had it since. On another night, she and I were pulling her car away from my house when we looked over our shoulders and spotted a dark mass moving across the front of the hedges. It was larger than a person, but had no definite shape, and its movement was too smooth to be anything I would normally encounter.

(T) and I broke up at the end of the summer, chairs, and wall shelving for books. On occasion, I was startled by strange sounds in the basement and would peer out into the darkness and try to use any available ambient light source to help me look around the room. Across the room, on a shelf near the books, there has always been a rectangular clock with a digital face. It has an orange exterior, and it looks like something that came out of the 1970s. As the minutes pass, I looked over to the clock and saw darkness move across its face as if someone or something had stepped in front of it. It could have been as many as thirty seconds before the darkness moved off of it and I could see it again. Another night

One evening, I’ve experienced some pretty spooky things here, and the Ouija board is probably not a good idea, but I’ve never played with one before, and it sounds like fun. Besides, I am supposed to be the skeptic.” We turned off the living room lights and began to ask the Ouija about the house. We didn’t really get any tangible responses, and the answers seemed to gravitate toward the numbers of the board far more than the letters. Finally, “I’m starting to get a little scared

Things soon escalated. There were early mornings in which I would wake to find myself with my hand close to (E)’s throat, as if I had been fighting off an attacker in my sleep. Yet, I could remember no dream preceding it.

Lying in the bed with me one night in the dark, to her horror that I had been asleep the whole time and had not been close enough to her on the bed to roll over on her.

On another occasion, and when she opened her mouth to scream, there was no sound, hauntingly revealing a bird inside her mouth, franticly flapping its wings.

My relationship with (E) did not survive, (B), who I had mentioned above during the description of the Ouija Board incident.

Somewhere along the line,” a film I hadn’t seen since it came out in 1997. My jaw dropped as I listened to the conversation between the Mystery Man (Robert Blake) and Fred (Bill Pullman) at the party. Following the Mystery Man’s claim that they met before at Fred’s house, he makes the impossible claim that he is also “there right now.” He asks Fred to call him there, and when the mystery man picks up, Fred asks how he got inside his house. The Mystery Man cryptically explains, “You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I am not wanted.” The scene gave me a chill, as it suddenly sunk in that it may have been my personal turmoil that contributed to “inviting” what I had experienced. The movie put my impression that the presence could “get inside of you” in a new light. It also made me remember a dream I had in which I was walking though the hallway of an apartment complex. I knocked on a door, with another woman opening the door to let me in. As this pattern was repeated

In 2005, and we eventually moved back to my hometown in 2010, when I received a job offer I could not refuse. We are now temporarily staying in my family home again after the sale of my own house, before we moved to Canada (where my wife is originally from). We are staying in the upstairs guest bedroom (where the experience with (T) above happened), and we haven’t experienced anything spooky so far. However, I try to spend as little time as possible in the basement.
I still don’t know what to think about what I experienced. As I mentioned above, I can’t help but think that the turmoil that I brought into the house at the time (cheating on my girlfriends, etc.) only magnified its presence.

My sister, and wanted to call out to my mother who was sleeping in a nearby bedroom. But, all of a sudden, she got this horrible feeling/knowledge that the thing that had grabbed her leg actually wanted her to call out to my mother, so that it could get to her as well. Unwilling to call out, my sister lay petrified in silence until she forced herself to move again.

In preparing to summarize these events, but I asked her more about it, anyway, to make sure I got the full, independent account of what she had experienced. She said that both she and a boyfriend of hers had slept in the basement and the clock had disappeared into the darkness for them. She said that the wall behind the clock is a “portal,” but she does not know to what. She is less of a skeptic than me, and considers herself “sensitive” to things that are paranormal. She does entertain the notion of ghosts and claims that she actually had a positive paranormal experience while in the house during the time that she was grieving for the loss of my grandmother (not the same grandmother who previously owned this house)**. Her positive experience was tied to a specific person, so she considers them completely unrelated. She agrees that the presence seems magnified by any turmoil she is experiencing in her life. She says she has even experienced the tactile sensation of something poking her while she attempted to sleep on the couch in the basement. She felt it was a “taunting” move by the presence.

*A note about (T): Relatively early in our relationship, her mother had experienced encounters with a presence, and my girlfriend talked about it like it was only natural that the presence would also reveal itself to her. (T) claimed her best friend had witnessed one of these encounters, when the shape of a man had protruded from the wall of her apartment. The most specific thing she could say about the man was that he appeared to be wearing a suit.

As some of my sister’s experiences predate my relationship with (T) and as the experiences continued after I broke up with (T)

**Notes about the house: My mom’s parents bought the house when my mother was 19 and away at college. My grandparents continued to live here until each required nursing home assistance prior to their deaths. My mother has lived here since a few years before my grandmother died, my mother had always thought there had been only one previous owner. She said that there was a man, his wife, and a young child who lived her for about 7 years. She explained that she had learned that, years later, the man had been struck and killed by a passing car.

However, we met a former occupant of the house for the first time. I was using the downstairs bathroom when my mom spotted a middle-aged woman taking a picture of the house from the front lawn. The woman explained that she now lives in California, but she had spent the first few years of her life in this house with her brother and parents, the original owners. She had stayed here until early elementary school, before she was “sent to California,” away from her family. He father had then died, which had resulted in “everything getting screwed up,” but she didn’t explain more than that. My mother had let her in, but she had later suspected that her brother must have actually had one of the early, I couldn’t tell if she was experiencing happiness

Each time it blinked it looked like it would teleport about 100 ft. It had a blinking interval slower than the cell tower
She sees it and at this point it is about three houses down and was coming through my neighbours yards parallel to the street; clearing about a yard per blink

The last time we see the whole thing it flashed about 50 ft away and about 10 ft off the ground, it was very bright and illuminated the deck even from around the house, like we can just see the edge of it. We book it inside, but never see the thing again.

1325913354.0,o6fi8,[FAM] The House on Edgerton Road,annuvin,38,2,13,"Sorry about the x-post

My cousin has lived in a 165 year old farmhouse for the better part of 30 years that can only be described as 'haunted as fuck'. I mean this in the most sincerest sense... One could make a movie about her experiences living there and it would be far more disturbing than anything Hollywood has put out in recent memory. The house is an old style farmhouse consisting of a dirt-floor basement, a small bathroom and laundry room. The second floor had four bedrooms and a converted sunroom that my cousin used for sewing and crafts.

To begin with, she woke up to the sound of Ed having quite an animated converstion with someone in the kitchen. As she came downstairs it became apparent that the conversation Ed was having was somewhat one-sided; Ed would speak or ask a question but no one would answer. A moment later Ed would resume talking as if someone had replied to him. 

As she entered the kitchen, ""Ed, who in the hell are you talking to?""

Ed turned and replied. ""The two ghosts. Can't you see them?"" He pointed to the two chairs. ""There's a big one sitting there and a little one sitting there.""

My cousin, ""well keep it down for god's sake. You woke me up."" 

At this time

                           *          *          *
After that night, but nobody would be there. Her and Ed also sensed that there was the spirit of a woman sitting on a bench and looking out the window at the end of the upstairs hallway. 

In the summertime, yet would resume as soon as they sat back down on the porch.

                           *          *          *
After Ed passed away, Rizzo, that would look into empty rooms and wag its tail like it saw somebody it new. Other times, Rizzo would be upstairs and they would hear its ball being thrown against the wall. They would then hear Rizzo chase the ball, only to hear the ball be thrown against the opposite wall for him to chase. When they looked upstairs later, the ball would be found in a place that wasn't normal for a dog to leave it (like shoved down the side of the couch, for example).

Another time

""You used to have a barn here

My cousin replied that there never was one to her knowledge, it started in the barn and finished in the basement.""

He then asked to leave as he was visibly shaken. Later when digging up the back lawn to install a fountain

When my cousin and Lenny wanted to have kids, voices, misplaced items and general poltergeist-type activity. As these types of things became commonplace they started to seem less out of the ordinary. ""There was a time,"" Lenny told me, ""when it only seemed weird if something didn't happen for a week."" However, one day my cousin came home to find Lenny on the back porch chainsmoking and visibly shaken. She had gone to town while he was alone in the house doing some renovations in what would later be the kids' rooms. He told my cousin he suddenly heard what sounded exactly like someone throwing ""a body"" around the house. The ""body"" was banging into the walls and floor, shaking the house. It freaked him out so bad he stayed outside until my cousin returned home.

One night, turning the pantry light on in the process. Having trouble finding the cheesecake, he called my cousin.

""What?"" she asked as she walked in from the living room.

Lenny spun around to the pantry

""I don't know who you think you saw up there

                           *          *          *
When their daughter was around four, they found their daughter sitting up in bed still screaming with her face as white as a ghost. Lenny tried to comfort her but she was in hysterics. After finally calming her down, Lenny asked what had happened.

""I saw a monster

It was years before she would sleep alone in that room again

Coming back from my aunt's house one winter night, who had insisted that all the lights be checked when they left hours earlier, lost her temper and turned around to give the kids hell about it. She was still lecturing them as they turned off Edgerton and on to the driveway.

1374431041.0,1irf5k,[ME] [FAM] Three generations of unusual encounters.,w0lfi3,46,15,6,"I have a ton of stories from my own experiences and my immediate family

I live in Lancashire, and while I am fairly superstitious and open to the unusual, my family tend not to be. Which makes their experiences in some ways more credible as they will admit to them being ""creepy"" but flat out refuse to refer to them as paranormal. Still, my whole family on my mother's side has at least an experience each to tell, so in my opinion my family are fairly sensitive. Some of the sound very unbelievable but I swear that they have been told/corroborated by various family members who DO NOT believe in ghosts.

My grandfather - was an electrician and took care of an elderly woman's home in the 1970s, the door at the top of the stairs opened a little and a slipper came hurtling down them. He later found out from her son (who lived down south and so wasn't usually around/in contact with my grandfather) that she had fallen down stairs and died earlier that week. 

My uncle - was about three or four, superstitious northern woman, after this story cropped up a few times she became worried and decided to go into his room once he was asleep and keep watch. After sleeping peacefully for hours, my uncle sat bolt upright and said to my great grandmother ""Grandma, she says she won't come if you're here"". 
(That one is my favourite family story).

My uncle and mother - as teenagers lived in a one storey house with a completely walled back garden - inaccessible except for through the house. Their bedrooms backed on to this garden

My mother and uncle also have shared nightmares before

Me - when I was 16/17 I lived in a very old country village, as you tend to when it's dark out and the lights are on in the houses - until I saw something that made me actually feel sick with shock. Staring out of a normal family living room was a completely translucent, stereotype ghost child. She was immobile, with her hand against the window pane just staring out. She didn't appear to see me or anything, but I was terrified. Just as I began to run, I forced myself to look back to check that she was still there, and that she looked the same from a different angle. She was and she did,,False,t3_1irf5k

1370916166.0,1g396e,[FAM] [Me] Who's The Lady Crying in the Corner?,samm157,41,8,13,"Hi

I overheard this story when I was about ten, my mom, my dad, and my nana inside. My younger sister and my grandpa were outside, shining some kind of police grade flashlight (my grandpa was a deputy back then) all the way across the giant back yard, so they could see the raccoons hiding in the woods. 

Anyway, in the living room, watching TV. My parents and nana were in the dining room, which would have been just behind me, and had no walls separating it from the living room. I start to notice them whispering. Not wanting to miss out on whatever they didn’t want me to hear, I tuned out the TV and started listening in on them. 

I remember it started out with a discussion about the Bell Witch. I have no idea why they were talking about that

Their story started with my cousin, but the story they were telling was about when she was two.) 

One day, having coffee and whatnot, when Rebecca said she needed to go to the bathroom. Since she was still potty training and all, being only two, my nana offered to take her. 

Rebecca and my nana got a couple of feet down the hall before Rebecca stopped dead. She didn’t want to walk anymore. My nana asked her why and her response was

Well, Rebecca’s mom, and my great-grandma. There was definitely no crying lady in the hallway in front of them. My nana tried to convince her that nobody was there, but Rebecca was having none of it. 

I don’t know if they ever got her to go to the bathroom or what

Everybody forgot about it

We were at my great-grandma’s house again. This time the only people there were my parents, watching Jeopardy. It was a pretty normal visit, until I spoke up. They say that I looked up, focused on the corner of the room, and said, “Who’s the lady crying in the corner?” 

Needless to say, in the same house, and I was the same age my cousin was when she said the same thing. If it was a coincidence, it was a pretty big one. 

To this day, and I’ve never asked. And I don’t remember any of it happening, because I was so young. But I know my family wouldn’t have lied about something like that. 

I’d love to go back to the house and see if I could have any other experiences with it. But, and another family owns it now.

It was also fully furnished with old furniture
The cottage was over a hundred years old and it was rumoured to be the first brothel in the city and it sat right next to a very old graveyard.  
 One night
Another time, but I digress.
The house always felt like it had a history but it didn’t feel evil or threatening.  The first night I stayed there
But things only started to get interesting when my girlfriend stayed over.
She woke up…bolt upright in bed and screamed at me that there was a man at the window screaming at us to get out because the house was on fire.  I tried to get her to describe him; she just said he was “olden day” and white.  She refused to stay over again
The things started to go missing
This happened with my house keys, my friend saw a key appear in mid-air and drop to the pavement.  I heard the tinkle, he was spooked.
Not long after, a woman walk past my hallway in a distinctive flower patterned dress.  Running into the lounge, I had two friends around and they were both wearing jeans.
One of my friends invited a person who I would describe as a white witch.   She owned a crystal shop.  This lady came round and performed a ceremony where we sat together on the floor with crystals and candles.   Invoking “angels” she invited who was ever in the house to come forward and step into the light…at that moment I swear I saw a bright glow and flash and then in front of us
This never explained the woman in the flower dress.
The lady and I went around and planted crystals and herbs on the corners of the property.  She explained that this would heal the land.
Not long after
While moving a chest of drawers
Funny enough, strangely, it was bulldozed.
Now sitting on the same spot is a garden sanctuary.  The council even diverted some of a creek to flow in it

This story isn't a ghost story - I have no idea what it is

I left this house four and a half years ago, depending on the period, as others moved in or out while I was there. There were two separate incidents of a very similar nature which freaked me out at the time: I saw what appeared to be solid, living versions of a housemate's friend and my then girlfriend, while they were actually elsewhere in the house.

I've made a little floorplan to give you an idea of the layout

The first was Jen. She was, slim, Scottish lady, with short, dyed-auburn hair. She would often come over and in summer, my housemate, Marie, talking to them and eating, past Andy's room, and a narrower passage through the door to get into the room. Next to this gap was Jen

Jen and Tony could see from my face that there was something wrong - and we were the only four in the house.

The other occasion was following a late trip to the cinema with my girlfriend at the time, we walked in and I immediately made for the upstairs bathroom, leaving Kate to walk into my room, immediately to the left of the hall, before the stairs. This was unusual for two reasons: we had a small, downstairs WC between Andy's room and the kitchen, opposite the understairs cupboard, which is strange as I hate the dark. Always have.

On this occasion, too. When I walked into my bedroom, expecting Kate to be there, she was not and the lights were still off. I went looking for her. I walked straight down the hall toward the back of the house, and saw her in the kitchen, in the dark - lit by the moon and streetlights, through a large external window above the sink. She turned away from the sink to the counter on the opposite wall

I started talking to her. And then within a pace or two

I called her name. Nothing. I called her name again. Nothing. I asked where she was. And then I heard her voice.

She was in the WC - obviously, so that she could not have moved from the kitchen into the WC without obstructing my view into the kitchen. And I saw her clearly, as real as I can see my housemate sitting in the chair across the room from me now.

Marie walked in the front door as I was calling Kate's name. She witnessed my genuine shock

So, I physically touched the person and I struggle to put that down entirely to imagination.

TL;DR: There were duplicate people in my house and I touched one.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/15h36w/me_people_appearing_in_two_separate_places_in_the/
1351197684.0,1233bh,[LEG] &amp; [ME] Der Butzemann ,686847dd,43,9,10,"I am honestly scared as fuck and questioning my sanity. This account is a throwaway for that reason (and I live in a very small town


But first


The Pennsylvania Dutch are really German/Swiss. They came from the Rheinlands, among other places in the late 18th and early 19th century. At this time, it should be noted Germany was not a country, it was a collection of city states and territories, and the Standard German (the main German of today) was only a written language. The people spoke their native Germanic languages: Swabian, Prussian, Bayernish, etc. So when they immigrated to central and southern Pennsylvania, that's basically how the Pennsylvania Dutch got here and got their name.


It is FALSE to think that only Amish are Pennsylvania Dutch. Plenty of Lutherans and other Protestants from Germany came to America and lived with technology and all that and spoke PA Dutch, because many where harassed for speaking PA Dutch/German outside of their homes during the conflicts.


It may surprise you to know (or not if you've read Nancy Drew or other 50's mystery novels) that the non-Amish PA Dutch were also very superstitious &amp; most believed in a good healing folk magic called 'Braucherei' (which invokes the names of Saints and Jesus) and a bad dark magic known as Hexerei. If you speak normal German you'll know brauchen is the verb to need. And I don't think anyone knows how in PA Dutch it came to also mean this sort of good magic. They also made hex signs and stars that they put on their barns or houses to ward off bad spirits or the evil eye. (This is where those red stars come from that have become real popular even in Delaware


Well, and for my family how we speak. We do use English quite a bit especially outside the house and I would call it my first language, but we do still speak PA Dutch for everyday household things. E.g. Kumm un helf mer die Lewesmiddel neizubringe! (Come and help me bring the groceries inside!) or: 'S Owedesse is faddich! (Dinner is ready!) I guess this is because my family has been and still are farmers. And my grandparents and greatgrandparents were stubborn and didn't want to give the language up. 


Sorry for all that. Now onto the actual legend. Der Butzemann basically means the Boogeyman in English (and in German German) but in some towns PA Dutch it has a more specific meaning: a Braucherei scarecrow created to protect the crops. Basically


You may have other scarecrows but you only do this to one. I guess he's supposed to be the leader. But anyway, it was bad luck. Now I've heard two versions of this part: His spirit cannot move on to the next world so he haunts you / He passes away and a evil spirit possess his body. My great-grandfather told me when I was a child, that when he was a child, a family didn't burn their Butzemann and an evil spirit possessed it and it ran about the countryside terrorizing people at night. 


But there's apparently one more thing that is worse than not burning him at before Halloween and that his stealing his clothes and wearing them (they normally have an outer old flannel or something over a t-shirt to wave in the wind so taking it off doesn't empty out the filling).
Legend has it this will make him haunt you. So naturally


So here's were I come in. I did this, like going into abandoned barns at night, going into the woods at night to these ""haunted places"", etc. I've done all of that myself growing up and other than running into squatters once and just getting scared, nothing 'paranormal' ever happened. 


So we head up to my uncle's fields and are sneaking through the fields. We come to the Butzemann


I wake up the next morning and walk out of the shed to go into the house and it and the barn have been teepeed. I'm standing there just looking at it


A week goes by and nothing else weird happens. Then next weekend, but it's not stained or anything. So I put it in a garbage bag and through it out in the trashbin outside. But as I walk away I hear the same my-voice/thought as before say ""Awwer ich hab gedacht, du wottscht ihn?"" (But I thought you wanted it?). But there's no one there. So I guess I thought it, but it felt like I heard it... like I didn't think it. 


But then I go into the trash because I think maybe I should bring it back to the Butzemann but when I pull it out... it doesn't smell at all. It was dry and didn't smell. 


I'm sorry this is so long and it's freaking me out thinking about it... there's more to tell but I'm getting worked up and I can tell I'm starting to write shittier and shittier.

",8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/xb9vr/last_winter_me/,"first off, i'll start by saying this is the truth and has been one of many encounters over my lifetime as I've been living pretty strange area of land this past year. Ufo sightings and strange occurrences are pretty common.  Bare with me as this is my first post in this subreddit, i'm not really sure of the format. I guess it's also important to mention that the area where this happened is on an indian burial ground.

Ok so last winter me and my cousin and our dog went for a walk over to where the indian burial ground is as it's a pretty beautiful area
 
 After looking for foot prints we decided to walk up to a big glacier rock that was farther up the hillside deeper into the burial grounds to see if who had lit the fire was hanging around there possibly. we didn't find anyone but instantly regretted it as our dog became very alert and started acting weird and we both felt as though we were being watched. we both decided to head back down to the open field area because there we could at least see anything coming at us. as soon as we started walking back down the hill to the field our dog took off running back home
  
  That made both of us a lot more uncomfortable but we stayed near the fire in the field a bit longer and just hung around even though we still had the feeling of being watched. It was around this time it became to uncomfortable and we started leaving. then we both heard a sound that i to this day can remember but cannot duplicate. We both heard a voice that sounded like it was speaking on many different pitches
 
 My cousin immediately was going to run but i told him to stop

Questions are welcome i'll try to answer the best I can.

1336420226.0,tbn9e,Doppelganger at the Mansfield Reformatory [ME],Weft_,36,4,5,"A little back story I've always told my girlfriend  that I always wanted to go ghost hunting. I always brought it up jokingly, but hey I had a few months to do some reading and learn a little more about the history of the place. 





Jump to that night. We drive to Mansfield and I borrow my  cousins camera so I could take some pictures. It was a really nice setup, for example flashlights dying, flashlights moving by themselves, footsteps above you, and one that stood out to me. One of the men tour guides talked about a doppelganger ghost. He said that on multiple occasions people saw someone who worked there had tried to hold conversations with them or try and get the persons attention, but when asking the person later about the conversation the person was either in another part of the building at the time or not even in the building when the conversation went on. After that they also took us to different places where they filmed The Shawshank Redemption it was very interesting . We also went to the shower room and this lady was ""communicating"" with a spirit there with the dowsing rods, It was kind of cheesy but I was in the mood to believe. After the tour it was around 9 and we all met up again then they turned us lose. We had all night to walk around the prison and explore. 





Right off the bat my girlfriend and I turned on our flashlights and started walking down one of the main corridors. My girlfriend was pretty nervous about the whole thing and was kind of regretting getting herself into something like this. After wondering round for 5 minutes we met up with another young couple that was in the same boat, feeling cold spots and getting touched. We just took those stories for a grain of salt. It was getting pretty late around 2-3 so we went and explored a little more.





Here is where things get interesting. We head to the front of the building, and started to look at our map to see where we wanted to go next. As we were looking at the map we hear someone coming up the stairs behind us, no big deal so we shine our flashlights over to the stairs because at this point we didn't see any lights coming up the stairs which was odd because that part of the building is pretty dark. Then up pops one of the main tour guides from earlier, no problem we saw a few of the guides walking around earlier just checking up on people and make sure everyone is doing fine. The wired part was he didn't stop, but he walked right by us he looked like he was on a mission, walking with perfect posture and had a blank stare on his face. So he walks right by us right into the room we just left. We were all kind of puzzled, like I said before ever other guide were pretty friendly they  would stop and talk to you. Something didn't seem right. So me and the other guy I was with walked back in the room we just came form. As we entered my heart stopped for a second, the girls were asking us why we didn't go talk to the tour guide and why we acting weird. We were pretty dumbfounded and I couldn't  talk,,

Ok

In a larger sense

[link to scholarly paper

So... what if every residual haunting is actually a result of some sort of interaction of local electro-magnetic and gravity fields that creates a sort of window to a specific instance in time?     
That is to say, regardless of outside stimulus or events, could it actually be some strange time-warp wherein we're viewing a slim segment of the past. 


There's also the possibility that this type of phenomenon could explain some intelligent hauntings as well IF they are confined to certain locale. The distortion created by gravity/emfs could distort sound and light (scientific possibilities) and when people whose personal emfs are compatible enter the area where these strange events are located
This would explain various strange and unexplained noises (voices from different people at different times) as well as why the hauntings in these areas 'react' to witnesses.

1376031134.0,1k0gro,[ME] Tear in the fabric of the universe?,Spyrember,49,14,29,"I’ve commented before, and maybe I should be a more open-minded individual. I have yet to explain this experience I am about to tell you

It was about 9:30PM in Phoenix Arizona. Back then gas was hovering around $1 a gallon and my friends and I would drive in my used Mitsubishi Eclipse from Phoenix to Tempe (about a 40 min ride) to party with some college friends. My best friend Chris was with me at the time and we pulled into a gas station on the corner near my house to fill up the tank before heading out for the evening. It was a typical Arizona night… dry air, and the temperature was around 100 degrees. The sun had already set earlier (around 7:30-8:00) and we were happy not having to deal with the additional desert heat.

I pulled the car up to the last gas pump. There was a large overhang above us, with the gas nozzle inserted and began fueling. My buddy, Chris, got out of the car and stood about 4 feet from me, on the same side while we started to chat about our evenings plans.

In the middle of our conversation there appeared what I can only describe as a white sparkling laser. It lasted about 1-2 seconds, and it was about 1 foot long, suspended in the air vertically. It seemed infinitely thin, and it sparkled as if someone where sprinkling extremely fine glitter through a laser beam. This gave it the impression of something like electric dust being poured onto the ground, only it hovered and did not continue to fall, nor was it a continuous line. The sparkles were perfectly straight, as if someone had cut reality with a scalpel. There was no sound accompanying the sight, and it was as bright as an electric arc, at about waist to mid-chest height

Chris and I both said, “What did you see exactly?” He replied, “Those white sparkles!” I asked him to describe it in detail, and it matched my own perception of what happened. We check the cement pavement for any sign that something had indeed fallen from the canopy above us. We searched for insects, spider webs, liquid of any kind, all the while knowing that what we had seen defied our own explanation that this could be the cause. Nothing was found in the area, like glitter.

I’ve searched the internet several times for other accounts of this phenomenon. Perhaps it was electrical in nature? But I could find no evidence of anything matching my description, and some have claimed to see it more than once inside their house, but I have only been able to find 3 other people who have witnessed this, and none have had a witness with them as I did. The closest example I can show is something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt7-lOur-VM but my own situation was on the ground, about a foot long, and completely vertical, lasting less than 2 seconds.

So there you guys have it. I wish so very badly that this was a supernatural event. I want to believe! I want to say I have seen a tear in reality, to rare forms of ball lightening, but I have yet to be convinced of anything, either way. It was startling to say the least, and was definitely something out of the ordinary that would catch your eye and perhaps even scare you.",,False,t5_2sntx,True

It was the last day of training when this happened


We had finished all activities for the day and we were just waiting for the final results of the training assessment. Me and my wave mates (a term used to call trainees for a contact center) were exchanging stories when someone mentioned that for some reason one of the lifts keep going to the 6th floor. It doesn't matter which floor you are coming from or which floor you are going to
Now this seems normal


Its time to go home and one of our wavemates decided it would be fun to go to the 6th floor to see how scary it is. We all agreed and so we boarded the lift (7 of us) and pressed on the 6th floor and the ground floor (our training room was on the 8th floor). Everyone was holding breath and anticipating a dark scary 6th floor. It was a let down because apparently the 6th floor was now occupied by another contact center
We were laughing at how stupid the idea was and so my colleague pressed on the close button.
Well we were on our way to the ground floor when we felt the lift stop. We were still chatting and laughing about the sixth floor when the elevator door opened... on a pitch black


It was then that one of my wavemates said ""just close the door"". All seven of us; 3 boys and 4 girls probably felt our heart skip a beat when the door would refuse to close..


The small screen on the lift said ""Overweight"".


Thats when the girls started to panic. I was banging on that ""close"" button but the door wont budge.
Two of my more courageous wavemates decided to leg it after seeing that the stairs was just 5 feet away from the lift. The second they leave the lift
I then pressed on G praying to God that my other two wavemates were safe.
The lift stopped and opened on mezzanine floor. Again
I pressed on the close button again and thankfully the next time the door opened it was on the ground floor.


My two gutsy wavemates were safe although they looked pale

Fast forward to me being twenty-two I worked at a place where I would have to be there for 6am. It would be pitchblack when I left for work. I had just gotten ready and opened the front door when I see him standing by the mailbox. I quickly jump back, Lousiana and live in Lafayette, LA). My fellow co-workers and I load up into the work van and drive the couple miles to our secluded work section that everyone called 'The Grove'. My job was Animal Care Technician. I took care of Rhesus Macaque monkeys. In 'The Grove' we had banks A-F and on each bank there were 18 huge ass cages and 36 little mini cages. In each big cage there would be a range from 10-20 monkeys. The small cage would be just another part they could go to unless they just hated everything and one then they were alone. (let me just say these monkeys were super spoiled. We chopped up fruit for snacks for them, they had tons of toys and when they broke the toy it got replaced with a new one.) I had E and F banks. Mine were all they way at the back of our huge fenced in area. While I was in the process of hosing down the huge cages on F bank, I see the man walking towards me again from the corner of my eye and when I look he quickly disappears. I relax after I see he is staying gone. After about an hour (cleaning the cages took a long time) I hear someone whisper my name. I look around to see no one so I continue my work. A little later I hear my older sisters voice say 'throwsomeshade'. My older sister was all the way at her house in Lafayette, I didn't have my phone on me so I didn't somehow pocket dial her and now I'm really feeling crazy. I go to our shack to drink some water and calm myself down. After the work day is done at 4pm I go home. Once laying in my bed getting ready to go to sleep, a deep man's voice says

That night I have my first nightmare where the man shows his true form. It is human-like but he is pure gold, didn't feel like myself and was terrified. (no I have neither been raped or molested before.) 

A few nights later he takes back his human form and forces me to marry him. He even has tricked me into believing I love him. I watch him kill people for fun and do other crazy fucked up shit.

A night or two after our wedding dream, felt like myself again and was no longer terrified. I felt very safe.

A few nights later I have a dream and in the dream I am hiding at a different place from my house. This building I knew the evil man could not enter. Well the man letting me hide there walks outside which I know is strange so I follow him and hide in some bushes. I gasp as I see him walk up to him. He is starting to tell him he has me inside when all of the sudden a shadow person is like ripped out of the man's body. The shadow disappears and the body collapses to the ground. He is angry and he knows I am around. He yells out

The weekend comes and as I am getting out of my car after pulling up at home from the corner of my eye I see the shadow being standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight. When I actually look at him he takes off running super fast towards me and disappears right before being in touching distance. I am really freaked out since I hadn't seen one in 18 years and I somehow knew it was the same one.

That's when it hit me that the shadow being and the evil man are related. I guess the shadow being is like a watch dog for him. It's been a while since I have seen him or a shadow being so I guess the blinding light being is still protecting me. Yes I know how crazy I sound.

I drew pictures of the shadow being and the light being (I'll post them later on or tomorrow)

I was driving the car my parents were letting me use for school over to a friends house. Down in the canyon we were living in a lot of the roads were either gravel, it was a 93 Taurus, which almost made me turn a full 360 and I barely managed to miss smashing into the barriers. There wasn't any damage what-so-ever to the vehicle where the thing hit me, no tracks coming out of the woodline, and no animal anywhere that I could see immediately after. On top of that, nothing that big made our branch of the canyon home. Needless to say it made my butthole pucker a little but there wasn't any damage so I never brought it up and decided to just forget about it.


Another time was when I was 17, and in a quiet neighborhood. From my dad's remarriage I had three step-sisters at the time, all younger, with the youngest one being around 6. My dad, step-mom, and I were in the living room watching a movie after my sisters went to bed. The hallway where all the kids rooms had two rooms on one end and one on the other with the door to the living room in the middle. The entertainment center in the living room was between the door to the hallway and the fireplace. The three of us heard something and looked over towards the hallway just in time to see a little girl sized form run past. My step-mom yelled for the youngest one to go to bed because she was the only one that size. Then my dad pointed out that my youngest sister was staying at a friends house for a birthday so he got up to investigate.

I was young, but i was comforted by the fact that i was a lot closer to my parents room which was connected to the livingroom. I just had to look to the left and see into their bedroom, it wasn't an odd occurrence for me to wake up and go to their room to sleep with them during the night.

I don't remember what day it was, in my sleepy haze it took me just a moment to realize that something felt very off. At the time i slept with this pretty thick blanket, pink and white, had little cartoon kitties on it, also i slept with a ton of stuffed animals around me. a big yellow dog (my fav), two big bears, a scooby doo stuffed animal, along with at least 5 smaller stuffed animals. I'd be very snug with the blanket pulled right up over my nose. 

So i woke up feeling this emptiness all around me, which they shared. 

Apparently my mom had woken up and walked into the livingroom that morning and saw me nude on the couch and instead of waking me up she ran into my brother's room demanding that they tell her what they did to me

I always felt uncomfortable in that room, we got two new kittens. One would not go upstairs at all, and the other would go upstairs, but not enter my bedroom. No amount of coaxing or treats could get that cat in the bedroom.

In my last 2 years of high school, I went away to college for four years. However, I was only an hour away from home, and came back to visit my family often (we are all very close). My younger brother had moved into the basement room by then, so my parents put me back up in my old bedroom. The visits home became downright frightening.

The night terrors came back full force, I woke up and felt a pain on the back of my left hand. I turned on the light and saw three red marks, like light scratches, and I figured I had done it to myself in my sleep. Each night, I was afraid to go to bed, take off my glasses, turn off the light

On one such occasion, and too afraid to move. Then I felt something on my face- fingernails. Three distinct fingernails, scratching my right cheek. I waited a few minutes, terrified, then ran to the downstairs bathroom. Three red scratches. They didn't break the skin, but they were raised, like a cat scratch. I spent the rest of the night in the living room

A few months later, it shook my bed. As if someone grabbed a hold of one end, one hand on either side, and shook it back and forth as quickly as possible. I screamed, leapt out of bed, and ran straight to the basement, as far away as possible. I spent the night on the couch a few feet from my brother- all the lights on and the TV on all night.

The next day, so there are no drafts to blow the door open. I really have no logical explanation how the door opened on its own and kind of laughed it off. 

Around March, I distinctly heard a young man talking quietly to the dog, and wondered when my GFs son came home. I walked into the kitchen and found the dog alone. Disturbed, I brought the dog into the living room with me, and about 15 minutes later my GFs son arrived home from work. A couple weeks later, my GF heard what she thought was a young man talking to the dog in the hallway when niether myself nor her son was home. 

One night I woke up and thought I heard furniture being moved around the basement. Thinking my GFs son had friends over, where I found my GF awake and looking for me. She said she awoke with a ""bad vibe"" and thought there was someone in the house. I took a machete I keep in the closet, went back to the kitchen and took the dog down to the basement with me, but found nothing amiss. I searched the entire house and could find no evidence of an intruder, so we went back to the bedroom. Suddenly there was a very large ""THUMP!"" above our heads in the attic. The ""attic"" is more or less a crawlspace filled with insulation with one trapdoor to get into it. There is no way anyone could have climbed up there as the trap is in the ceiling right outside the bedroom door. I tried to convince my GF it was a mouse and we tried to go back to sleep.

We started refinishing the basement this spring and noticed a lot more activity since we have begun. One night my GF and I were watching a movie when we heard distict knocking on the wall inside the house. My GF thought it was the dog scratching itself until I pointed out the dog was on the other side of the room. We both attempted to replicate the knocking by rapping outside the window

My GF's son has a metal clothes rack hanging on the back of his door. Often when he isn't home, the noise will often start up again after we leave. 

Last week we had three weird instances that stood out. The first was when I was working last Saturday and my GF was alone at home. She sent me an email that said she came down the hall to find both the bathroom and her son's bedroom doors open when she was sure she closed them.

Later that night I go to get a drink of water from the kitchen on the main floor, and the cat is down there. It runs into the basement when I come down the stairs and starts meowing loudly. I have some water and decide to go investigate. I go downstairs, and notice that the litter pan, food dish, and water have all been removed. The other roommate took them when he came to move his cat out.

The basement isn't big, old notebooks and binders, the usual student stuff. There is a water heater in furnace in back, and I hear the cat walk back there. Its basically the only part of the basement that isn't really easily accessible. I tried to find the cat (lights are on) but for the life of me I can't.

I left it alone and kept hearing it at night, and left a bowl of water for it. I would still hear it scratching and see it heading down the stairs, but never did actually did catch it. It never used the litter or ate the food, but the water would disappear. Not sure if evaporation (the basement was pretty dry) or it was being drunk.

After two weeks, its framed) he says ""I see the cat is still living here.""

I said, but he left this other one, and didn't tell me or leave food or water. The girl shakes her head and says ""He always lies about his cat. It causes so much trouble and he always denies it.""

They share some other stories about the irresponsible roommate and leave.

At this point, the other is really quiet and in medical school, so only really comes home to sleep for five hours before heading back in to the hospital. Medical school girl inexplicably has a dog that she keeps in her bedroom. One day dog is in basement, incessantly barking. Medical school girl is trying to get it up the stairs and can't. I eventually come down, and while she drags on the leash I pull under its collar and we drag it up the stairs. She takes it outside for a walk. No idea what dog is barking at. Dog is never allowed in basement again (wasn't really in the first place.)

Second girl roommate is in law school. Very sweet and friendly, I tell her its the old roommates, it lives in the basement, etc. She is animal lover, wants to catch it (I love cats too, btw, but just figured live and let live

Anyways, I mention ""Yeah, I can't believe you left your cat here with no food."" He blows up: ""I don't have another cat! There is no cat! Its not my cat! I don't know that cat! Why does everybody think its my cat! There is no cat!"" slams door and leaves.

Law school roommate and I still hear cat

Just kidding, I sealed it up good, shouldn't have any critters in here."" Still hear cat, sometimes see cat on stairs.

Some things that are probably important for context's sake are that I live with my boyfriend, I've gotten hunches or vibes for as long as I can remember. I've learned to trust them, although sometimes I'm in a situation where I have to ignore them. 

Monday: Even though I'd gotten a full night's sleep on Sunday, and they're always in motion. At one point in the afternoon, I thought I saw my cat walk across the livingroom but when I looked, it was actually a semi shapeless black mass, about cat sized. This time when I saw it, it didn't zoom out of sight like the smaller black dots tend to do, it leisurely floated across the room until it got to the wall and then seemed to sink down into the floor. It was freaky but kind of interesting so I went about my business. 
Because I had gotten decent sleep the night prior, and I had a sort of nagging feeling, like we shouldn't be ready to sleep. I took my time getting undressed and then sat down on the bed for a minute, hoping something would click (like I'd left the oven on or something) but after my bf asked if I was going to stay up, I remembered how tired I was and laid down. I had an incredibly hard time drifting off so I just thought about stuff for a few hours with my eyes closed until I abruptly snapped my eyes open and turned my head towards my boyfriend. I don't know why I did it just then, it was without any conscious thought. The room was still dark but the moon (I think) was bright enough to where my eyes could quickly adjust and see pretty clearly. 

As soon as I turned my head, and blackness where it's eyes should be. I couldn't make out for sure whether it had actual eyes or not, but there was occasionally a slight shine in the middle of the blackness, so I think it did. Looking at it straight on, the face was shaped a little like the top view of a cow's head. It was looking straight at me. I stared back at it trying to get my brain to register what it really was while my eyes got used to the room. At first I thought it was our dog, who has a mostly white face and had come to bed with us. The minute I saw it, I'd immediately gotten the feeling that I had caught it, it dawned on me that I was hearing him snore at the bottom of our bed. Without looking away from whatever it was I was seeing, at any time during this (other than the light doggy snores) in the room. What I can only assume to be it's body was more like a mass of in motion black shadow, and it appeared to have come from his side of the bed since there was a good part of the blackness on the side of my bf I couldn't see

What went through my mind was weird and chaotic. I couldn't believe that I was seeing this, but stayed surprisingly calm and still. I wanted to protect my bf, but I didn't think I could. Still staring at the face (which was still staring at me, bobbing back and forth slightly) I slowly (very slowly) started to slide my arm (which was under the sheets) towards my bf. I felt his body, felt his breathing, and I tried to tap him awake without causing the creature to notice. After maybe five or so seconds, the face suddenly rose up (still locked on to me), I KNEW that I absolutely did not want him to wake up. I sensed an incomprehensible danger in the room, whereas I just didn't know what I could. 

Then, but somehow this thing kept moving back, not into the wall exactly, just... into something that I couldn't see. I watched the shadowy parts slide off my bf, and then watched as they and the face began to get smaller. Not shrinking though, more so it looked like it was getting farther away, right in front of me. Then the wall behind it was back in sight. I had just enough time to think ""Is it over?"" and then a white light outside lit up through the windows (on the other side of the room), three seconds), and after keeping watch over the part of the wall where that thing had disappeared for some time

He's not a believer in the things he can't explain and is the type to dismiss what he doesn't understand. He is however a very good listener and doesn't scoff or judge those who do believe that there's more to this world than we yet know. In the course of our relationship

------------------------------------------------

Last night: I'd slept well the night before, although I felt tired and drained all day yesterday. That's not unusual for me though. It also made sense why I was ready to go to bed with my bf last night, although it hardly ever happens three times in a row anymore. Up until we were going to bed, I'd felt fine with the thought of doing so but once we actually began the shut things off, that feeling of dread and hesitation returned. This time it was worse than the other night, although I chalked that up to what had already happened. Still, I tried to stall us in every way possible. I even tried to get my bf to stay up and play video games with me but for him when it's sleepy time, I'll stay in the other room and do computer stuff but I couldn't shake the idea that I shouldn't leave him alone in that room, breaking it, I finally put in a movie

I woke up several times throughout the night, my sleepy state had made it lessen a great deal. Eventually, it was light enough outside, so I relaxed and tried to tell myself I was just ridiculous. This time when I fell back asleep, I had some of the most uncomfortable, disjointing bad dreams I've ever experienced. Or rather, it was all one dream just with different parts. All I remember of it now are shredded rectangles of paper, a ferris wheel spinning freakishly fast, and heavy things being pushed/dragged/moving

Just when it seemed that the chaos was at it's peak, because I knew I'd woken up but for some reason my head felt like it was covered with bugs (I could even feel them crawling down my neck and the side of my face) and his screams, they were of both panic and great fear. When I turned to him, I saw his eyes and mouth were wide open and he was looking at something I couldn't see while his body jerked and his legs kicked violently. I shot up and called his name but I could barely hear myself over his screams. He started trying to slap and claw at something on top of him and howling (I mean that as dramatically as it can possibly mean) ""Noooooooo"". I started screaming his name and tried to touch him but he was jerking around so much my hands kept getting thrown off. He looked at me, with more fear than I've ever seen in a person, and begged me to help him then he went back to screaming wildly and clawing again. It looked like he was trying desperately to get up, but something was preventing it. I didn't know what to do. Finally I brushed my arm through the air where the nothing was (and eerily enough, his thrashing almost stopped and he jumped up, oh my god, in a protective sort of way. I grabbed at him again and because it looked like he was most concerned with something being on his back

Trying to absorb everything that just happened,  I started to cry. He tried to console me and I flinched, realizing that I half expected my bf to attack me. The danger feeling hadn't gone away, only shifted. I just don't understand why or where but it still hasn't gone away entirely. 

He wouldn't explain what happened for awhile. I gave it some time and then pressed him again before he left for work. He said he thought he felt a bug crawling on him. When I said it must've been a pretty big bug, him saying similar didn't exactly explain what he was clawing or looking at. I should add that I hadn't told him about my bug experience yet, and no, there wasn't actually any bugs around. When I tried to ask him more about it, he waved me off and told me not to worry about it, that it was just a bad dream, still smilely and nonchalant. It's possible he was just trying to put me (or himself) at ease

For the record, how real that fear is. That ex did everything from pulling me off the bed to save me from giant maggots, smoking cigarettes and having active conversations, to flat out trying to kill me more times than I care to remember. This whole thing felt like something entirely different, though I know my saying so is not proof of anything. It also matters to me that in the four+ years we've been together, my current bf has never experienced them (and has no known history of them before our relationship). My ex had them regularly and his family had countless stories about them while growing up. His live-in brother had them too, but not violent and very seldom. That doesn't make me an expert by any means, disorientation

I've read all about sleep paralysis too and though I've never experienced it myself, I didn't feel locked down in anyway, there really wasn't any of the usual symptoms other than having been on my back and seeing such a terrifying, nightmarish thing. My thoughts were ignored in comparison to a greatly heightened instinct, but they were very much cognitive and not dream like in the slightest. 

That being said, explaining it without worrying too much about sounding crazy. I feel crazy, in the sense that I can't wrap my mind around it all. I'm still jumpy and incredibly uneasy. I'm dreading tonight. I don't want to go back into the bed room, but I'm just as afraid to leave him in there alone and maybe if I'm being honest with myself, I'm a little afraid of him. Like I said, there's been some other stuff that's happened before this and it only adds to my worry, but I'm not going to bother getting into it. It's probably not related and this post is quite long enough. So,,False,t3_1h7vla

The legend is

 So one day, and read scary stories. We eventually went to sleep and the next morning we checked out the hole. The rocks weren't there. So we thought people have drove by and removed the rocks while we were sleeping. (The site not that far from the highway and there is a rest area right beside hole.)

We decided to camp out another night and put rocks in the hole again to see if it would stay recovered. We went to bed and the next day the hole was empty once again.

1365536337.0,1c0d42,[FoF] My friend told me the story a few days ago. Thought it belonged here. Video included.,tetewhyelle,51,16,32,"So this story freaks me the hell out in general. I didn't even really want to click on the youtube video to get the link for you lovely lads and ladies

So basically, that's supposed to be one of the most haunted cities in the U.S.. She was friends with this guy named Charlie, who is the original poster of the video and seen in the video a few times. Charlie lived in what she called a 'boarding house'. From what I understand, it's like 4 bedrooms that have like key locks, but they all share a living room and a kitchen. Which is somewhat shown in the video. 

Apparently nobody ever lives there for very long and the place is always for sale because they can't keep residents very long (wonder why). So Charlie and three of his friends ended up renting the place while they attend SCAD. One of the friends was a girl and records show that she is probably the first female to ever live in the house because it used to be some kind of boys home or something. The four of them started experiencing really strange phenomena and did it Paranormal Activity style and used their mac computer to record video all day

So the girl, but supposedly her phone would randomly just start playing that song even though it was dead or turned off. It would boot up, play the song, then shut off again. Like we're talking random times to. From what I remember, it happened like in the middle of the night or like during the day. Really sporadic. It also I guess happen almost every time they talked about the weird stuff going on. But only while she was in the house. Never at school or while she was home visiting family. Eventually she deleted the song off her phone for obvious reasons and I think may have even gotten a new phone at some point and it still played the song...even though it had been deleted from her phone. 

I guess the ghost had a thing for her because it messed with her more than the guys. She would wake up to find her room had been ransacked while she was sleeping, but I'll let the video show you that. What ended up causing her to move out was one day she came home from class and her bathroom was flooded and all of her clothes were in the bathtub.

The guys would also experience weird stuff too. Apparently, and they'd come back on. So he yelled at the guy across the hall to see if he was messing with him and the guy said no and his lights were doing it too. So Charlie got up (still dark) to go talk to the roommate and as he was leaving, his art kit for school went whizzing by his head, narrowly missing it. He looked in the corner that it had come from and at first thought he saw a trashbag in the corner, but realized he was staring at some sort of a figure, so he high tailed it the fuck out of there.

That's all the stuff I can remember for now, here's the video of Andy the Ghost. You'll see why they call him Andy.

When I was almost 16 (28 now for some reference) my mom

I was an only child from my mom (my parents divorced when I was three) so I had the entire upstairs to myself. It was a friday night and I was up late watching cartoon network. I turned the tv off and rolled over to face the wall to try and get some sleep. All of the sudden my tv turned itself back on. I didn't know why it did that so I just turned it back off with the remote. But before I could roll over it was back on again, an interest I had back then but not something I wanted to be educated about by the church. About 10 minutes passed and I got more irritated than unnerved by the fact that my electronics weren't behaving as I thought they should. I reached for the remote and turned the tv off again, almost daring it to come on. Thankfully it did so I rolled over and tried to go to sleep. It was an old wooden house so there were a lot of random creaks but having lived there for so long I knew where each one was. One in particular was beside the futon I used as a couch. It wasn't out of the ordinary for my mom to come and gripe at me for being up so late so I looked back over expecting to see her. I didn't see anything and I realized that I didn't hear my door open. I stared at the spot for a few minutes before a shape leaned around my futon to look at me. It looked...well...like an imp for lack of a better way to describe it. It couldn't have been more than three feet tall. Then I noticed an unnaturally thin, unnaturally tall thing standing near my doorway, leaned over because it was too tall for the room. Both were watching me and not moving. By this point I was starting to get scared, but I didn't move or say anything. I knew that it couldn't be just my imagination because plenty of moonlight was coming through the window in front of the futon. My room was rectangular with the window and door on the opposite side of the wall where my bed was with the futon in the middle. These things seemed to defy the moonlight because I couldn't see much more than shadowy forms even though the rest of my room was relatively well lit. The third figure was just icing on the cake. It was huge and looking into my room from the second story window. There wasn't a balcony or ledge for anything to be standing on. The tall thing and the big thing both looked like their heads had a bunch of jagged horns coming out of them. That or they were crowns of some sort. They didn't make any moves towards me but I got a feeling that they weren't exactly nice. Then after I blinked they were gone. I got up and turned on a light but there was no trace that anything was there. I tried to force myself to stay awake but eventually I passed out. The next morning I thought nothing of it all until I went to get in the shower and noticed a pinkish scar on my stomach. It's just to the right of my belly button and goes from slightly above my waist to right under my diaphragm at an angle. My parents had no idea about it and couldn't provide any explanation.

Fast forward to when I was 25. I told the story to a good friend of mine that I made in the Army

Let me explain the layout of the upstairs: At the end of the hallway was my brother's room, I don't know why lol), and with the way my bed was positioned, I could see both my mom and brother's rooms/doors. 

In the middle of the night, or something, in front of my mom's bedroom door (she slept with it closed and always locked her door). My brother's bedroom door was also open, and it let in light from the street lamp through his window and into the hallway. Even with the light, this figure was pitch black. 
I was, trying to get inside. I was interested and confused, and so I kept watching. After a few moments, I called out ""hello?"" and the figure stopped for a moment, and continued to try to open the door. Then I actually got out of bed, to get a closer look. As I crept forward, I said ""hello?"" again. The figure looked like it turned towards me

I really couldn't tell you why I kept trying to talk to it and walk closer, and zoomed into my brother's room. At that point I got a little freaked out because I couldn't see it anymore. After standing in the middle of my room for a couple minutes, I decided to peek into my brother's room.

My aunt and uncle live in a very old house in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Everyone knows the basic creepiness of an old house. Creeks, a girl named Anna &amp; an older son named Richie. One night when Anna was about 7 or 8 she woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of her door creaking open, she looked up and saw a dark figure but thinking it was only her father checking up on her she rolled over and went back to sleep. A few nights later she woke up again in the middle of the night to the sound of someone rustling through her things on her dresser. She rolled over and saw the same dark figure. She thought it was her older brother Richie so she sleepily asked him what he was doing but he didn’t respond, he just walked out of the room. The next morning at breakfast Anna asked Richie what he was doing in the room the previous night, but he said that he hadn’t gone in there. She told him that she knew he was lying because she clearly saw him over by her dresser, but he swore up and down that it wasn’t him. Her mom and dad kind of just laughed telling her that maybe it was a ghost. 

That next night she woke up again, turned on the light &amp; the figure was gone. She told her family about what she had seen but they were very skeptical, she was quite young and I guess they assumed that it was just her imagination. Although she never felt as though it was going to hurt her or felt threatening or anything I can guess it was still really freaky to sleep in your room when you know there’s something else in there with you, so from what my mom told me she slept with her light on for many many years, till she was in her late thirties and was married and living with her husband. But the story doesn't end here. 

You know how I said I was going to circle back? Well here we go. My uncle was renovating one of the rooms on the third floor of the house &amp; was going to remove one of the walls. When he started taking the wall down he found a few really old shot guns
Now Anna was in her 20’s when this discovery was made and one day my mother decided to stop in and say hello and what not. After talking for a bit she saw a picture on the mantle and said how lovely of a picture of Anna that was &amp; asked when it was taken because it seemed to be very old. As you can probably guess

They had brought the pictures and papers to the township’s history office (or wherever they keep the old files, had been in love with her when she died suddenly. Because of her death Brian later committed suicide in the house.

Because of the very striking resemblance between Anna &amp; the school teacher they assumed that the figure that she had seen was Brian. He had probably thought that his love was back so he went to her. It kind of became a little joke within the family that Anna had a ghostly admirer

Years later when Anna and my mom were both in their 40’s my mom visited her at her house which was only about two blocks from her mother and fathers house. Creepily enough the house’s back yard was a very small grave yard. (Things are always happening in that house, scaring the shit out of my mom and startling Anna. Apparently they just started laughing and Anna said “Hello Brian”

In my house there are 3 holy days: Halloween, for we believe these are the days when the spirits are closest to we the living. On Halloween all the spirits are set free and allowed to roam and do as they please, on All Saints Day we honor those brave spirits who's love for humanity transcends the mortal coil and even their own Ancestral line. But Day of the Dead! This is the most important. The Ancestors come close and the Dead seek out their descendants. For the final day, our loved ones are closest to us before the boundaries that separate us are put back up. On this day we honor our own Ancestors with prayers and a dinner, and we take offerings to the cemetery(A candle, liquor, tobacco, and homemade food). We thank them for all their service

My GF and I have been dating for 4 years, speaking in different voices when I do my work. She's not sure what she believes but she's seen enough to at least know Spirits exist. So, she decides she wants to be apart of the ceremony. I think she's at least ready to do this, so I agree.

First Day of the Dead, but she gets a sense it's warm and comforting. I think she's got it down.

Come 2010. We decide this time to drive out to Crooked Mile Cemetery(also known as Georgiana Cemetery)

*""Consider, and some say contact, long deceased relatives. Stories of the unthinkable, including hands protruding from the ground, are numerous indeed...""*

So we go inside, but it sounded like things moving. First slowly, like waking up, and then more quickly. I feel a welcoming presence, like friends happy to see me. GF feels something **far** different. She kept saying she didn't want to be there, that they weren't happy she was here. I tell her to stay, they won't hurt her. But the leaves start sounding like shuffling, that they felt like she didn't belong there. After some thought

We arrive with our supplies. GF takes a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/848jJ) to show what it looks like before the ceremony. We expected to see some orbs, not even mean. GF felt very calm. Just as if we had sort of ""charged"" their batteries.

We pause for a few moments and GF decides to take another picture where the first one was. [See here.](http://i.imgur.com/0JIKf) HELL of alot more activity. [She turns right and takes a picture.](http://i.imgur.com/P9ulz) [She turns further to the right and takes another](http://i.imgur.com/JkalN) Lots of activity. So we sit there quiet and start hearing noises. Walking, but more like they wanted to make a noise to let us know they appreciated the gesture of kindness and offering. After all, the offerings empower them. So as we sit there and hear this really strange noise behind us. The only way I can describe it is something coming out of the ground and crawling. We both look behind and see this weird blue streak thing. She snaps a picture quickly. [Notice the blue orb right next to the grave and seems more solid.](http://i.imgur.com/0S5To) After that she was pretty much a little weirded out and we left. I thought the pictures were cool, but nothing unnerved me.

More was to come.

Fast forward next year's holy days. No car, and Day of the Dead comes up. We have our dinner and honor our Ancestors, and then I say that since we don't have a car I'll have to walk to the Melbourne cemetary. 5 miles there, 5 miles back. GF is against it, long way to walk. I say I have to do it. She understands, I head out.

I walk with this year's offerings

After the train passes I walk to the entrance and ask for permission to enter

NOPE.

I was alone, as this place is close to the water so I relight it everytime. I even say something like ""I'm trying guys. Keep the wind off me so you can have your candle."" For a little while the wind does die down and I can finish my prayers. Being alone, and kind of scared, rather then stick around I head out to leave.

Remember the bit about the omen I missed? Yeah, and continue to walk across the road and stop by the sidewalk. I suddenly realize I can't leave without closing the ritual and I look back and say my goodbyes.

Now I'm across the street

What happened next spooked me so much my whole body seized up

Luckily even in fright I continued my closing. So what did I see? The darkest pitch black outline of a **large** ""human being

1335148686.0,snjww,[ME][FR] Skeptic to believer in one night. All it took was a doll... (very long post),BezziVelinov,37,2,7,"Originally posted in r/paranormal

I never believed in the paranormal as a kid and throughout most of my teen 
years.... until one night that made me a firm believer. I was a normal 16 year old high 
school girl. Made decent grades
stayed out of trouble. I decided to introduce my best friend
school PC games: American McGee's Alice.... a totally morbid and macabre game based 
off the story of Alice in Wonderland. She loved the game almost more than I did. She 
would draw creepy pictures of Alice and the Cheshire cat
almost every time she came over. At this same time
fascinated with the whole ""Wicca"" thing and started practicing it: Dressing in black
wearing pentagrams
about it too much... honestly I didnt care or judge

One day she surprised me at school by pulling a figure out of her messenger bag of 
Alice
as I was a big fan. Actually
figures. I wanted them too! A few weeks had passed and as always
Algebra 2 class to her waiting for me. She looked a bit uneasy and before I could say
 anything she handed me a note. I dont remember exactly what it said
the lines of ""I need to talk to you about something... privately. Not over the phone or in 
public."" Naturally
 nicest guy Id ever met... did he hit her? Omg what if he's doing worse?! All sorts of ""omg 
what if...?"" questions started whizzing around my head and made waiting for lunch almost
 torture. When I met up with her
building at the limits of campus. I proceeded to ask if she was ok... she said she was fine
 but was very scared of going home. I instantly thought her step dad was being an 
asshole again. I hated the guy and was ready to pounce on an opportunity to give him 
what he deserved. She swore up and down that she wasnt making this up and if I didnt 
believe her
Immediately I put on my poker face and listened. She told me about one particular 
practice that she did called ""spirit writing""
inviting your ""spirit guardian"" to control your hand and answer the questions that you 
write. Of course the first thing that popped in my head was ""What the hell.... you scared 
the shit out of me for nothing"". I kept listening though... She told me the names and ages 
of her ""spirit guardians""
amounts of details about them. It seemed that one of them
liked the Alice figure she had shown me a few weeks ago.

Ali's room was about 10x12 with her door in the corner
adjacent to the closet doors just a foot or two away. The bookcase was 
roughly 10 feet from the door and the floor was carpeted
Suzanne ""played"" with this figure everytime Ali would leave the room. Progressively it had 
gotten to the point to where she hadnt even stepped out of her door completely before 
turning to see the doll gone from its perch on the bookcase and at her feet.  ""Ok
lost her goddamn mind"" I thought to myself
straight face. I wanted to believe her
creepy doll moving on its own? Whatever. But
my disbelieving heart to call bullshit. So I told her I would stay with her over the weekend 
if it really scared her that much. I even offered to help her research on how to fix the 
""problem"" So the weekend came and I went home with her from school. As we walked in
her mom was in the kitchen cooking something that smelled amazing. I took Ali's stuff 
from her and carried it to her room as she started talking to her mom in the kitchen. I 
opened the door
off my backpack and put it in front of the closet doors like I always did. I straightened up 
and looked at the Alice doll that adorned the top shelf. I just... stared at it. Almost felt 
like I was making eye contact with it. Slowly I turned and walked away to join Ali and her 
mother in the kitchen.

We were talking and eating for roughly half an hour. None of us had left each 
others sight. Ali and I started talking about our art projects as her mom started washing 
dishes. I wanted to show her what I had done so far on my piece and hopped off the bar 
stool to go to her room. The door was ajar
the Alice doll and its creepy vibe... until I walked in and saw immediately that it was not 
on the shelf anymore. I paused in mid-step
darting all over the floor
 looked under the bed
Could you come here a second?"" She walked in and noticed what was wrong. She did the 
exact same thing I did: spun around looking
shelves
not possible...."" I kneeled down and grabbed a strap. It was almost painful to lift... but 
there it was. Alice was underneath my bag. ""No fucking way.... how the fuck?"" After a 
moment of well... just staring again
My mind ran through all the possibilities it could. ""The wind knocked it over. Someone put 
it there when I wasnt looking. It was there in the first place."" Ok
are closed. Secondly
Thirdly.... well
back on the shelf
had just happened. I couldnt think of an explanation. I shook off my creeped out feelings 
and proceeded to do what I originally intended to do.

A few hours later
and drawing. Her mom popped in to tell us she was going to the store and as soon as she 
left
room. Alice was gone again. But this time
doorway
icecream and jumped back into Ali
once again positioned her on the bookcase. Alright
actually kind of pissed at this point. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. So I 
suggested we perform a few experiments on the bookcase. We bumped it
things at it, knocked the walls, opened doors, 
opened windows
it even budged was when I took my shoulder to the side of the shelf. Even then
not bounce on the carpeted floor. How the fuck was it getting aaaaaaall the way to the 
door and furthermore

The rest of the night
Ali's mom with groceries
Single. Time. Sometimes she would be a few feet away
times shed be almost in the doorway. We spoke nothing of it and just put her back on the 
shelf. I didnt want to think about it anymore
reason. I didnt want to admit that it scared me and I DEFINITELY didnt want to admit 
that it might be a spirit or whatever moving this thing.

Finally
year old girls do
under a big feather comforter... I loved that blanket. I was in the middle of my sentence 
when a rattling sound interrupted me. At first
was coming from the bookcase. I completely froze... and I could feel that Ali had done 
the same. 30 seconds straight of no breathing or moving and the loudest pulse Id ever 
heard in my life pounding in my ears almost deafening me to the rattling on the shelf. Ali 
sprung up and yanked the chain on the fan to turn on the light. She leaped from the bed 
and snatched the doll off the shelf
the lid shut
Alice was returned to the shelf
wasnt allowed to play with Alice anymore. The activity didnt stop there at all. Weird and 
crazy shit continued until almost the end of my junior year
another day. Even now
and how it changed my whole life. Sometimes
and in some way... I hope it does.

Hey guys

Now, the Lady, and the Door."" Just FYI in case you have read it. I have lost the post, and it was done in haste anyway, so I am going to try to take my time to rewrite it. I don't like to think about these things while at home so I only have a limited time to work on 'em. For this reason, I may take time to finish this post through further edits. 

I am going to post about my first two encounters

**""The Spiral and the Lady.""**

Ever since I can remember, had locked someone up in my basement. I went down to the basement to try to unlock him from the crate he was in, but as I did, the door opened, and I saw the fucking doll descending the steps and looking at me. That, that is my first damned memory.

Still, but I am a man of science. Science is my life. I have to mention that. And you will see that I stayed true to my skepticism even during these events.

Once, and I noticed it since I was awake and bored as hell. Everyone else had already fallen asleep. 

The spiral was extremely faint. So faint that I could hardly tell it was there. So faint that, and it would wind into itself slowly. It wasn't big. It was about five inches, maybe three, across. It would spin, spin, spin, like water in a toilet, and thinking it may be ""gathering."" I dropped the thought and fell asleep.'

The next morning, my sister looked up at me in surprise, and said she had seen it too. I, of course, wasn't buying it, so I asked her to give me the details. And she did. You bet she did. She traced the spiral in the air while describing how it would wind into itself, disappear, and she saw it while laying in bed awake. 

I'll admit, I didn't think of it much then. I filed it away as strange, but nothing special. I was a kid, then, maybe 12 years old. I had nothing to fear, I thought. Not in my home especially.

I have never, and I have something to fear, especially at my own home.

And this is all due to this next encounter. You see, traumatizing encounter, and I get the feeling that these two are related. I'll share my baseless opinion: That spiral was the lady, or her energy, and it was gathering. 

So let's move on to the lady.

Fuck. This is the image that is furthest in my head. When I die

A year or so later, I would have walked out into the hallway, unaware of the horrors that awaited me. And my whole life would have changed, probably for the worst.

I woke up in the middle of the night, and something white was out in the hallway. 

I was scared. Very scared, I took a quick peek, and saw this long shape with what looked like a head, all in white. (fuck, here come the goosebumps!)

It was then that I allowed myself to actually be afraid. I looked away immediately, but that thing was out there in the hallway, and my scream would either draw it to me, or it would make my mom see it from a close distance. I didn't want her to get hurt.

So I sat there, all while feeling very stupid, as if I was acting it out for an audience. I knew I was awake. I didnt' need those tests. But I did them. But at the time, I was proud of my bravery of the dark, and of my intelligence. I recognized the moment for what it was: a pivotal moment in my life. My chance to find out, once in for all, that ghosts don't exist. 

So I sat up

And it was a lady.

It was a lady. She was there, and her fucking slippers, which may I point out were pointing DOWNWARDS! *Fuck*. Her hair was long, down to the waist almost, and it curled upwards at the end, as if it was made up. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, this pale white. Like an unpainted figurine

As I sat there in the worst moment of my life, or else I wouldn't be here. I panicked, I cried hot tears, and I covered myself fully, faced the wall, and went to sleep. 

The next morning, then ran down the stairs screaming for my mom. I don't think I ever recovered from that. Get me started on this topic, and I can seriously have a panic attack. I have before. I never even understood panic attacks until I tried to tell the tale to my friends in HS. We were at a sleep over, 4 of us total, and I found myself crying and panicking that the lady would get me then and there. It was unreasonable, but I had no control over it.

I was 12 or so, as much as I wish I could. 

And like I said, and the years passed, I started to doubt it. I never doubted the fact that I saw what I saw but... I mean, I was 18 now, an atheist adult, so surely ghosts just *couldn't* exist, my memories notwithstanding. I just couldn't be sure of it, I asked for reassurance. and oh boy did I get it. That tale is called **The Door**

Sorry about my long-windedness. It could be worse. I am still typing this in haste.

Feel free to ask me questions. Pardon any grammatical errors

Until next time...

1315591138.0,ka9nk,Weird cheap hotel room,,34,2,6,"I've spent maybe the last week or so reading everyone's great ghost stories and have been wanting to share some of mine. This one is pretty short and definitely not the most frightening experience I've had

My boyfriend and I drove 8 hours down to SoCal for a wedding one weekend, eyes closed, afraid to look up but finally mustered the courage to after hearing whatever it was walk around our small room for a few minutes. Everything was exactly how we left it, doors bolted and locked, windows shut, lights off, etc except I could make out a strange shadowy figure pacing back and forth back and forth from the foot of our bed to the bathroom door, I think it was looking directly at me. I held onto my boyfriend and went under the covers
The next morning we woke up and I let my boyfriend know what happened, really huge, dark, brownish stain in the blue carpet, there were also smaller stains and splatters of this colored stain all over the carpet surrounding it as well as another larger stain next to the wall, you could tell someone spent a lot of time trying to clean the stains but they were too strong to come out. The wall was also a little off; there were weird patches of dark brown paint randomly painted over the white walls, always near the spots on the carpet. It was obvious someone's intentions were to cover something up. We had also noticed that at one point, throughout our short stay we got about ten calls from guys asking if random girls were there.

Never did find out what happened in that room but it was kind of creepy. Our last day there we made up a story about how someone killed a hooker in the room and then police (or someone) broke down the door to find the hooker lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Not the scariest or best story out there...but it's 100% true!",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ka9nk/weird_cheap_hotel_room/
1374086556.0,1ii4k1,"I have always felt the Minnehaha falls were haunted, but now, I know. (real story, not for nosleep)",Forworkveiwing,14, but yet some how a lot of people go down there at night. For many reasons. Graffiti

My favorite reason to go down there at night is to gaze at the stars! It is so pretty and besides the ford bridge having traffic

Now in my family, cause though they are frightening, it is not anything to run out of a place too quick for. 

I was in a previous relationship where the guy didnt like to get out much at night

My new boyfriend is down for anything! So we went down to the falls and we hung out by the actual falls for about 20 minutes at 10pm and all was okay. I knew someone was watching

We dicided it would be a good idea to walk down the the mississipi, so we went up the stairs to deer park and walked down to the river that way. Not a good idea. 

We went down there and deer park was sort of open, because usually they all look at me if I am in a place where I can sense them. But I digress. 

We walk down to the wooded path where we would walk to the river. Now this is where things get weird. I felt someone on the **other side** of the creek looking at us. but I am used to this because before, I still wanted my bf to have a good time and I didnt want him to know that I was scared so I continued on with our walk. 

There are three bridges we pass on the way to the river from where we were walking. Two on ground and one over head. We passed the first one on the ground, as I get older, it is easier to tell these things). 

So as I was saying, it is right in front of me. He is not aware that he is not alive, it seemed like. He just walks patrol, it feels like. but he was not happy. I couldnt get a clear feeling of what he was feeling but I know he was not happy. knowing this, I keep walking cause it was only one, and there was one on the other side. so as long as they were not near and did not want to bother me and my boyfriend, I was okay with that. The feeling just scared the living shit out of me. 

So as we keep walking, being that it seemed as though he was being chased. I did not see what was chasing him, but he was clearly running in fear for his life. I feel like this may have been how he died, being that he was running so fast and the look on his face was clear, but it was a shadow. I could almost hear his screams. But they werent screams. More like he was hollering. he wasnt saying anything. Just hollering. At this point I wanted to Nope the fuck out of there. But as I said before, I didnt want to frighten my Boyfriend, so I kept walking. 

The next time I see another ghost,but made it look like I could see right through him (that is what I normally do with spirits, as to not attract any attention to myself by them. I fear of being followed and that is not something I want.) I could tell he wanted to speak to me, but being that he wasnt sure if I could see him, he didnt say anything. (which is awesome, normally I can get all sorts of signals and sometimes questions that I have to ignore) But he wasnt firendly, but nor was he frightened. he was just there. Like he knew he was dead, and he was walking right in front of me

So we get down to the river, metaphorically speaking, not literally. We get down there and it is dark and it was cloudy over the river, so I was disappointed, but i still wanted to have a good time, so I walk out of the wooded area and start to talk to my boyfriend about the river and how pretty it usually is at night and how I have been down there before and how the river was so high once, I couldnt walk down there. After I say this my boyfriend stops me and he points to the shore and tells me he thinks that people are down there and I saw no one. So I told him he was just seeing things and that they were rocks, they arent. They are rocks. Which they were. Then he tellls me that he wants to get out of there and I persist on going down there cause I did not walk that way and pass three ghosts for nothing!!! I was scared. But I know spirits can not hurt me. They just frighten you. But then he says something

So we walk back

We get up the stairs and the rest of the night, the entire way we walked down there he said he had goosebumps but he didnt want to say anything. He said that sometimes he can feel something in the room that isnt there, but he cant see anything. So this confirms that I am not crazy and that i wasnt just seeing things. This is by far the most frightened and not only that, but it is also the first time I have clearly seen anything physically in front of me. Usually they are just in my head, speaking to me and asking me things, or in my dreams. I have never felt this but it excites me, sort of.

Just to put you in my frame of mind

From the ages 3 to 14 i lived in a 2 bedroom flat/apartment with my mum and little brother (6 years my junior). My front door led directly into the hall

Now for as long as i can remember into my childhood i would walk through my hall in the direction of the lounge/bedrooms

Now this ""figure"" was completely black, neck and left shoulder (from its perspective) of the child shadow that would pop out and disappear.
So this happened to me all my childhood and it wasn't until about 10-11 years old i started getting scientific with my little friend. I was trying all manner of lighting and door arrangements

Typing this i realise it sounds pretty stupid/weird and maybe should be scary for a kid my age at the time

Years go by, partly because it was as normal to me as taking a piss and partly because it, well, sounds stupid.
 Around about 13-14 my mum gets a new bloke and he has two kids. A daughter my age and a boy my brothers age. One day for some reason i brought up my peripheral vision abnormalities with the daughter(who has been in the house countless times) and she says something like ""fuck i see that too but was to embarrassed to say yadayada "" 
I find this very peculiar so decide to dawn my detectives hat and for the first time in my life i ask my brother ( 7 years old ) if he sees this thing. Nonchalantly he is like ""yeah i see that

Moved out of that flat about a year later and am now 27 hoping to begin studying for a PhD in the coming years. It was procrastinating on this sub reddit that brought these memories back and i thought id share it with you guys as i cant for the life of me come to a logical explanation about it. Most likely its something to do with the eyes and the shape of the area causing some black spot in the form of a small child appear in your periphery lol fuck knows. Just weird that my mum never saw it and i was her height when i was 14

Was speaking to my brother about it yesterday before i posted this for some clarification and he also told me he used to see the same thing in one of the doors in my grans house. I never experienced it there.  

Sorry for the massive block of text but i just want to ask if anyone else has had the same specific thing happen to them or something similar or an answer of what it could be?

1367030127.0,1d71qw,Handful of scary shit [ME],tonyfromtexas,43,13,6,"Ok folks

Story 1
Some back information. I lived in a neighborhood that consists of one street and three houses. We lived in the middle house. To the right of us there was a family of five; father, and one disturbed son. To the left of us lived a family of 3; mother, father, and a disturbed son. We had come back from vacations the day after this little shit storm occured. The night before we came back the distubed sons from the house on the right and left went off to the house on the left and murdered the father and mother; they then took off to go kill one of the sons grandfather but they commited suicide on the way over. Ok so new family moves in; a mother, father, and a their young son.

Ok, a few weeks later who was at the house that night. He told me that it was only his parents and himself. I cant recall how I was able to attain a picture of the disturbed son but when I did, well yeah, sure enough, it was him.


This is another story that has the same kid but its unrelated. One day we were playing at his house and he asked us if we wanted any caprisuns. You dont turn down caprisun. So he goes and gets them. He starts to take long to return so my bro and I are like wtf? We go over to the kitchen and find him in the fedal position rocking back and forth. We ask him what the fuck he is doing and he just says ""oh

Ok enough about neighborhood haunted as fuck. Time to move on to Mexico. 

Story number two. One time in Mexico I was staying at my cousins house. So night time comes and we are going to bed. I get to sleep on the floor. Before we head off to sleep my cousins decides to tell us about his grandfather that had died in that house. AND that sometimes he still hears his grandfather calling for him. OK thanks cuz, yup, yo' boy. So they fall asleep super fast and I'm trying to go to sleep. Nervouse as fuck. I remember drifting into sleep but then being wide the fuck awake because it felt like someone was staring at me. As if someone was standing right in front of the window looking down at me as I was sleeping or trying to sleep. I couldnt move, I mean I could move but I didnt fucking want to. I was paralyzed with fear for about 20 minutes until I got enough courage to stand up and pull the light switch that was right above where I was sleeping. The moment I put any effort to lift myself off the floor the dogs (who are somtimes kept on the owners roof in Mexico) that were chilling on the roof right above me came running to the exact spot I was at and started to bark like crazy and scratch the floor crazy style. I laid right the fuck back down and didnt move for another 35-40 minutes, not a god damn muscle. After many many many prayers I summed up enough courage to stand up and pull that light switch again. I pull that mother fucker and that mother fucker does not turn on. Im instantly in my cousins bed shaking the shit out of him so he would wake up. The whole time I'm covering my eyes so I dont look towards the window. He finally wakes up and turns on the light; he is too sleepy to stay awake and fell back into sleep. I was fine by then; you know the light conquers all and shit. End story.

Story number three. I'm proud of myself for this one. So my older brother bought a house and me and my younger brother moved in to help pay for it. About 3 months in this crazy shit occured but let me explain my theory on why it occured. My older brother and my sister in law (his wife) were constant argueing for about 2 weeks straight before this happened. I'm pretty sure that negativity is what had attracted this thing in the first place. I'm saying this because the house was brand new; we were the first to live there.

Ok, barking her ass off. I tell her to chill out and she just looks at me for a second and then right back to the middle of the living room barking her ass off. I think to myself ""oh hell mothafuckin no; we just moved in this motherfucker"" and stand up and walk to the middle of the living room. I stand there and put my palms outwards and say ""listen, I dont know what you are or what you want but here you will only find love; if you want love and love only you are more than welcomed to stay, but if you want anything else you must leave"" and at that very moment that I finished  saying that the dog stopped barking and laid down all chilled out. That was that.

Story number four. I was running the shift one night at the plant with my younger brother. My dad had finished his shift a few hours earlier and went home; or so I thought. I'm standing in front of my bay looking in at everyone set up the line for production. I look down the factory towards the loading area and I see my dad leaning against a guard rail. I didnt have my contacts on that day so it was pretty blurry but I could make out my dad's figure; brown baseball low profile cap on, what the fuck are you doing here?!"", the last insult sent my ""dad"" into a chuckle. I could make out a smile and his shoulders boucing from chuckling. I turn to look for my brother inside the bay and I call him out asking him if he knows why dad is still here. Took like 2 seconds to ask him and turn my head back. Mother fucking ghost was gone. I immediatly call my dad and ask him where he is at. He says home and is a little annoyed because I keep asking him if he was just here. Finally he makes it really clear that he had left hours ago and that he thinks I'm on drugs. So I hang up and that was that.

Also, a frantic woman scream, a boy laughing, and tell me they see shit out of the corner of thier eyes; I believe them because I to have been fucked with here. One time I was walking back towards my bay to go do some prestine managing; I was looking down at my phone while walking and I saw from the corner of my eye and heard someone walking up on me really quickly. I look up and turn my head and the damn ghost plays a ""cant see me because Im moving with you"" game and kinda shuffles behind my back until I fully turn all the way around and the ghost is gone. Seems like a playful ghost to me.

Ok

My baby was 2 weeks old when this happened. I woke up to my baby crying and it sounded like someone was walking down this long hallway with her. She kept getting father away and I could hear the footsteps getting more and more distant. So in a fit of anger I scream out ""GIVE ME MY BABY BACK!"" but my mouth would not open for shit and all that came out was ""MMM M MMM MM MMM!!"". This angered me even more so I attempted to spring out of bed; nope

So these are my stories. Hope you enjoyed.

1366235829.0,1ck9uj,Why I will never use a ouija board again[ME],Asmoreality,39,8,14,"Everything in this post is true, and others have told me they understand completely what I went through. THIS POST IS VERY LONG sorry about that.

I have always been the kid too into horror movies and thrillers, not much else ever has. After the following occurrences I don't think ill ever be as scared as I was during the time of this ordeal.

One day whilst at home with my girlfriend we decided to make a ouija board

Incase some of you didn't know you aren't meant to ask spirit intimate questions about its death(how did you die? What was it like? Etc), eventually it was forced of the board as if someone just pulled it out from under fingers. We both looked at each other in disbelief, I wanted to tell her to stop joking around but I knew and wasn't get and same for her to me.

We decided we'd give it another go an try to contact the last spirit we had been in touch with to apologize, we asked for the spirits age, 46, after this we asked for its name it slowly spelt out the full name of my girlfriends family friend nick, I felt this calm warm feeling inside me; adversely my girlfriend felt terror and much to my dismay flipped the board without putting the glass to ""goodbye"". She immediately ran into my room and started crying her eyes out, I didn't want to but I expressed the importance of putting the glass I ""goodbye"" and how of you don't the ouija board doesn't fully end.. We never went back to say goodbye.

Night 1
That night I went to bed as usual, the next morning the weights were by the side of my bed on the opposite Side of my room to the door.  I asked my my if he'd moved them, she hadn't.

Night 2
The same thing happened again. Exactly the same placement.

Night 3 
I went to bed as usual and in the morning when I woke up

Night 4 
I was lying in bed around 2am, I felt the sheets move. It then got up and a few seconds after my door once again opened and closed. The next morning my weights were in the hallway outside my door this freaked me out more than I have ever been in my life.

Night 5
I slept in my little sisters room on her bottom bunks and all night it was as if she was speaking in tongues

He came into my house and was immediately shocked at the spiritual state of my lounge room, if anybody is thinking of the playing the ouija board think of the negatives, it's not just a bit of fun, most people you speak to that have played will tell you it was a mistake. It is.",,False,,False,t3_1ck9uj

Okay

**First**, however, think consciousness might be separate from matter, and that we as a species understand very, very little as yet about all the energies in existence and the nature of consciousness.  

I grew up in a religious, so I never saw a single horror movie (worth watching - I think we watched the PG-rated ""It's Alive"" from 1974 when I was 10 or so) until I was in my teens.  The dogma surrounding this was that Satan was trying to let himself in via entertainment (sigh I hate even repeating this idiocy).  In adulthood I made it clear I was going to live life on my own terms, so in visiting my parents at 25, I watched what I wanted as long as they weren't home.

**Second**

The people who lived there before us were a crazy elderly couple who then moved into assisted living

**Third**, and it tapered off when I was 19.  The frequency of these occurrences - and, for the most part, the non-scariness of them - had led me to have a practical and almost dismissive approach to the unexplained.  Okay, so unexplained things happen sometimes, never when I expect, and never what I want (like a full-on Brown Lady)

So even though it had been a few years since an encounter like this was 'normal

--------------------------

Having missed out on many movie experiences children of the 80s grew up with, but it didn't work.  Like many horror movies that would've probably been much more effective on me in childhood, I was mostly bored, though impressed with the creativity of the special effects.  

My parents lived in a rural area, or maybe someone pulling into the gravel driveway from the crunching of the gravel under their tires.

So as I sat there bored

The first was off to my left, the sound a stiff, old-fashioned ladies' dress makes when the lady is walking in it at a normal pace.  

I knew nobody was there.  I didn't turn and look - because if it was a ghost, that was really my thought). I knew immediately several things:  one, that my mind was not playing tricks on me.  The sound was very clear, and close.  Two, that I was scared, sure, but I also felt no ill intent from the source of this sound.  Three

The second noise was a little further away, but about 8-10 feet away.  It was a heavy clomp-clomp-clomp of a man wearing boots.  Heavy, old-fashioned super-tough boots.  My dad is a working man and has always worn work boots, but his are made of modern materials and have rubber bottoms, and they sound a little less heavy.

The clomp-clomp-clomp of the boots was again a normal gait, or anger.  This time, for an absurd moment, I wondered if my dad was somehow there.  I realized an instant later that of course he wasn't (we all came and went via the super-squeaky back door, the floors squeaked, and he would've been heard long, long before that point) and, I didn't look.  I was sitting still staring straight forward at the movie in absolute terror.  (And absolutely nothing on the screen was terrifying to me

Then the final sound.  A rapping on the back window, but still audibly clear as a bell.  Taptaptap, like someone would when coming by for afternoon tea.  This one was about 20 feet away.  As with the second sound, for a brief moment I thought it might be a neighbor or someone we knew knocking on that window.  Then that thought fled again, because it was pitch-dark outside and nobody would  knock on that window even if it was light.

I sat perfectly still staring straight ahead at the movie, as scared as anyone is of the unknown, but I felt no ill will, bad vibes, or any other different feeling like cold or hair raised or thick air.  I stared straight ahead acting indifferent until the movie was completely over, and it had been some time since anything happened.  The entire encounter had taken place within forty seconds, with a lengthier pause between the boots and the knocking than between the swish and the boots.

I went to bed that night unafraid. I wondered briefly, like, vibes or something.  But the conclusion I eventually came to was that watching the movie itself put my mind in a state where it was able to hear those noises, and things of that type were probably always present.",,False,,False,t3_1c1tzb
1364246914.0,1azz1v,[ME][FAM][FR]College Dorm with Crazy Activity,beatleape,38,5,11,"Hi again

Over the past few days I've been sharing all of the ""ghost"" stories that I have heard from trusted family members.  Today

When I was a freshman in college, blinds opening and closing, etc.), but we never really paid much attention to her claims (which I'm sure she didn't appreciate too much).

That all changed one night when I went down into the basement to do my laundry.  I took the elevator down, I looked out into the hallway.  Underneath the stairwell I saw this little (3 feet tall?) shimmery, sparkly looking shape.  It looked like TV static.  This was right as the doors were closing.  I've never had a longer elevator ride, even though I was only going up four floors.  Of course, in a panic, I told my roommate what I had seen, but she thought I was totally nuts.  This was at the very end of the school year

The next year, my future-hubs (I'll call him ""Hubs"" from here on out) started having some really bizarre experiences.

The third night that he lived in the room, so he asked our friend Dan what to do.  Dan told him that he should lock his door so that ""I"" wouldn't come into his room again.  Lo and behold, after locking his door that night, ""I"" was standing in his room... again.  Of course, this really shook him up, and he ended up telling us about it.

Soon afterwards, he realized that his roommates were gone for the weekend.  He spun around in his bed so he could see what was going on, and he saw the same girl AND a LITTLE SHORT GUY!  At this point, he had never heard my story about the shiny, sparkly thing in the basement, but since it was short-statured, I think it was the same thing.

The activity really picked up from there.  One night, skinny shadow (I describe it as a person with Abraham Lincoln's build) take one giant step past the door.  Another similar experience my roommate had was while she was putting on her makeup to go out one night, she saw a black flash dart across the mirror in front of her.  There were other times when something really loud would run down the hallway and pound on everyone's doors when there was no one in the hall.

One afternoon, but when he got home from class, nothing was out of place at all.

Towards the end of the school year, and by the time I jumped out of my chair to see what was going on, he was already in the hallway.  I asked him what had happened and apparently he looked up from studying and saw that the blanket that he and his roommates put up to divide the room for privacy was kind of moving.  He looked again and saw what looked like a finger tracing or pointing on the other side of the blanket making big sweeping gestures.  The window was closed, which even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter because it didn't look like a blanket blowing in the breeze.  It had a distinct motion to it and there was a clear pointy finger or something that was behind the blanket.

The next year I decided to live off-campus, Hubs was waiting outside without a coat or anything and jumped in my car.  I asked what was going on and he said he was up late watching the Red Sox play in Japan (it was about 3 am, I think) when his door shot open.

So he was a trucker doing a run through rural Lancashire and stopped in a layby (a paved area of a road where cars/trucks can stop for a break) and he was having a nap. Now its about 4am in the morning and there is fuck all about when he hears like a rumbling, he thought probably the battery was done in (even though he had it replaced a couple of weeks prior) so he goes to check his phone, which is dead and won't turn on. He notices as well that none of the electrics in his cabin are working nor will his truck start. The pressure starts getting what he could only describe as heavier and he notices the hair on his body is standing on end. This is all only a minute after he heard that noise, now he said he looked down the dual carriageway (out of his windscreen) which was lit by street lights and then looked in his wing mirror up the road and saw the street lights all going off one after the other coming towards him. He said something shot over the top of the truck and down the carriageway over the lights that were going off in its wake. Now he was really creeped out by this because other than that faint rumbling it was too silent for how close it felt, he had to wait for ages too before his electronics started working again. 

He's since dismissed it as some sort of military aircraft because it happened near where I live which is near I think a BAE/UK Military testing base. I'm tempted to agree with him since we've had several strange occurrences happen which were later explained by the base to be experiments conducted by them

Essentially, and have done for as long as I can remember - I'm 16 now, and I can distinctly remember these things happening from about the age of 4. I'm normally just day-dreaming in class or lying in my bed thinking about random stuff and then I see a random scene (no longer than 30 seconds) that is normally rather mundane, but I know I have never encountered before, and then, within 6 weeks (normally closer to 3-4 weeks), that *exact* same scene happens. It's generally stuff like a snippet of a lesson or a conversation at lunch, and so I decided to just make sure I can answer those questions

I'm not one to particularly believe in the supernatural but this has happened frequently enough and for long enough that I can't ignore it.

The house is two stories

Often over the years, along the balcony, and go through the window/door to outside and disappear. It would always be during the day, and she described her as a younger girl, maybe 10-12, white dress/nightgown and long dark hair. 

I never saw the girl go along the balcony, as I was getting ready for bed, I walked up the stairs and as I rounded the corner to get to my bedroom, I saw a girl in a white nightgown walk into my room fairly quickly. I thought it was my younger sister, trying to hide in my room to scare me as she often did. I thought to myself ""nice try, I totally caught you!"" and entered my room. I checked the usual places my sister would hide; around my bed, in my closet, no one was in there. There was no way my sister could have sneaked out of my room without me noticing. I found out later she wasn't even upstairs at all. 

None of this ""activity"" bothered or scared any of us

YEARS later, and we had all brought our SO's along with us. We were all sitting at the dinner table, getting ready to eat, just waiting for my sisters boyfriend to come down the stairs. When he got to the dinner table, he had a weird look on his face, but didn't say anything. 

Later, and stepped to the side to allow her to pass. As he got to the table, however, he found my brother's girlfriend was already at the table waiting with the rest of us. 

He isn't sure who he saw, but couldn't be sure if it was her he saw coming up the stairs.

Experiences with ouija boards part 2.,,41,11,20,"It seems that you all enjoyed Laura's experiences and I hope that some of you heeded warnings on why they shouldn't be used. Yet again I'll begin by warning you of two things. 1 please don't use them. 2. Excuse spelling errors

Last nights experiences were the only ones Laura was willing to tell me

Tonight I will share two personal experiences of ouija board use. I apologise for how long this post is. If you read all the way to the bottom

My mother passed away when i was 5 and things havent been so good since. most of my childhood i spent wondering what it would be like if mum was still alive, but not the dangers. i thought to myself, "" maybe i can contact mum!"" obviously with ouija boards this is not the case. its an open portal to anything that wants to chat. The first time I was around 14. I had a friend, a best friend during high school called renee, do this board session with me. We were home alone after school when we decided to do it. Things were going fairly standard at first. Standard questions dumb teenage girls ask when they're excited and think they're being cool. I decided to talk the plunge with this entity on the other side and ask if it knew my mum. ""Yes""... ""Can you ask her to talk to me? I can give you my cell number to pass on to her if you like? Hahaha"". Idiotic.

What ever it was on the other side just kept pointing to ""yes"" more and more feverently, the fucking table began to shake. We both shot up away from the table, and the bloody thing still shook like an earth quake. I had heard that if you apologise to the spirit profusely, it will go away. So I did, very quickly. We decided to leave the house, and the still shaking table. We then both cleared the board off the table (which was still shaking when we left), ran outside

To be honest

My second experience was with my friend Laura and her youngest daughter Emily and is an experience that happened a year ago when I was living with laura and her family.

Emily was at the time 13. She had been brought up knowing about her mothers talents and in a way was quite gifted herself. Although had trouble controlling her talents unlike Laura. Emily was more susceptible to negative energies rather than positive ones. Lots of weird shit has happened to Emily through her life. But she has her mother to guide and protect her.

Anyway, always bubbly and chatty. Awesome young woman and very much like her mum in ways.

Emily had been warned through out her life that ouija boards

As all teenagers do

They all decide to do an ouija board at Kim's house. Laura and myself didnt know this at the time. Emily's friend Kim

Emily comes home from kims house

Laura asks em what's wrong after half an hour or so, just swore at her. An argument ensued between Laura and Emily. Emily, normally mortified to even swear, let alone treat her mother like that, didn't care and stormed off to her room swearing all the way. 

Laura and myself were pretty shocked. We sat in the couch for a bit and Laura said she would talk to Emily properly after the dust had settled. We both knew something was up with Emily and it must be a rather big deal for her to act the way she was. 

Before Laura could go and talk to Emily again, chest, arms and back. Like some one had grabbed her really hard or tried to strangle her. Laura demands to know who did this to her, and Emily claims she doesn't know. Laura asks what happened over at Kim's house. 

"" mum

Laura by this point is panicking. She tells Emily to run herself a bath and cleanse herself in some Epsom salts for a while.
Emily grumpily pushed her mother out of the way and told her to ""fuck yourself"".

Laura asked me to run Emily the bath and put the whole box of Epsom salts in with it. So I did

I walk outside and Laura tells me she thinks something has attached itself to Emily through the ouija board. All the cussing and attitude was not her Emily. The bruising was messed up and she was going to get help from one of her healing friends and her son
Laura makes a few calls and these guys are at the house before emily has finished her bath. They call Emily out into the lounge and tell her what's going to happen. Emily reluctantly agreed to the healing and Laura took her place behind Emily's head and acted as the guide. Her son was there to ""earth"" the proceedings and Laura's friend

They managed to get thing attachment out of Emily. But not after she thrashed around for  30 minutes, and I'll never forget it. Truly awful thing to ever hear. The entity had a name, but I have sworn never to repeat it. 

After the healing was over, felt cold hands grabbing at them trying to pull them away from the healing and away from Emily. Flashes of fury was experienced by all three at some stage during the healing. About 10 minutes after, the three of them noticed the same bruises that were on Emily's body, were now on theirs where the cold hands had been grabbing at them. They all felt sick and individually went to go and throw up. Laura was the last and came back saying she had flies in her vomit. We all went and checked it out, ( totally gross I know but it's not everyday you see that) sure enough amongst all the bile were three winged bluebottles, still moving. Laura was not in the habit of eating flies just to assure you. This was pretty much a result of whatever was inside Emily has manifested itself into Laura, or tried to. I still don't really an explanation for the bluebottle flies. All I know is that I saw what  I saw. Heard what I heard.

Anyway, it was like she was watching a movie through her own eyes. 

I hope you all enjoyed reading and I hope that some of you have possibly learned from others mistakes. Please, you don't know exactly what you are letting in. So please don't.

1349475716.0,110knv,[me] My experiences in an old southern house and church on old lynching grounds.,floralmuse,35,2,11,"So, but please forgive me if I missed something.

When I was young (6-13) I lived in a house out in the countryside in SC. I had several strange experiences there and my most vivid memories of the house all include being terrified and feeling like I was being watched from the woods, and I assume this to be a mistake.) In the effort to remain anonymous I've linked to an article that does not give the exact address, but it was a church yard. I lived in a house that was next to the church on the same property. 

Also, all of the phenomenon stopped completely when I moved out of the house, excluding the possibility of it being in my head.

As I said, even though it was a mile to the nearest house and there was next to no chance that anyone (corporeal) could see me. I would see things moving around and shadows shifting out of the corner of my eye, and there would be nothing there. At night I would hear your standard old house creepy sounds, but occasionally stranger things would happen. I frequently laid awake, too afraid to sleep until I was exhausted. One night a marble rolled out of my closet. It was an old house, so at first I thought it might be just that the floorboards had shifted slightly. The marble kept rolling though, back and forth over the entire course of the room for several minutes before it rolled under my bed and stopped. 

Another night I turned over in my bed and saw a shadowy figure standing next to my bed. It was like he was made of a 3d shadow material, when I was in college and lurking on /x/ on 4chan I saw a picture of him and learned that other people see him and call him the ""hatman"". I nearly shit my pants. He had always seemed like the most explainable, that maybe I fell asleep and just dreamed him, but the confirmation that other people see him, and he was EXACTLY the same... that just kind of blew my mind for a few weeks. 

Yet another experience, with a streetlight providing some illumination through the stained glass windows. Just as my hand touched the light switch, a silhouette of a person walked between me and the window. I panicked and flipped all the switches on the panel, and there was no one in the room.  

My most terrifying encounter was when my parents had a meeting at the church, and had large black areas for its eyes. It either had no eyes or they were so sunken I couldn't see them. I don't remember noticing much of a mouth, I just kept staring at it's ""eyes"". I froze completely. All the hair on my body stood up and I broke into a cold sweat. I just was so terrified. I had nowhere to run, as it was blocking my path back to the adults. After what seemed like forever I slowly backed out of the kitchen area with the door and sat back next to the tv, and waited until my mom came to get me. I didn't tell her about it until years later. I still have a bit of a phobia about darkened windows.

When I told my parents about all of this later they admitted what they knew about the history of the property, and my mother said she too saw the shapes and shadows shifting around the house.

A little background:  I'm in my mid-30's, about 10 years ago, I decided to take what money I'd accumulated and put it on the line to go into business with my father.  I saw him everyday and we worked well together, he became my best friend. The business was a modest success.  I guess it's relevant to note that during the time we worked together, he developed Diabetes, which he failed to control with anything approaching discipline.  So his health was certainly on everyone's minds. 

My then-girlfriend (now wife) and I decided to buy a house.  Because this necessitated saving a little more cash than we had on hand

Anyway

It was about 11 pm when I felt- honestly, and I felt not all there.  If I were you, I'd think it was the whiskey, but trust me, I know whiskey as well as I know anything, and it wasn't the whiskey. I then literally felt compelled to take a pencil and a sheet of paper and begin writing.  I went over to a bureau and began drawing/scribbling frenzied circles from the center of the page outward.  I began crying as I scribbled.  Then I wrote 'MY HEAD,' and 'MY HEAD HURTS' (it didn't, which may make my physical location pretty easy to identify, worried about my father's health

After about 10 minutes of what I'd describe as this really abnormal behavior, I got a call at about 7am.  My father had slipped on ice, fracturing his skull.  For about 3 days, we had no idea if he was going to live or die- he had several 'brain bleeds' and they kept him in a medically-induced coma for I think 4 days.  He ended up getting through it, although he did permanently lose his sense of smell, and was a somewhat different person after the accident.  He also shared that he swore he was 'with' family members (in corporeal form) that had passed.  This was after they stopped with the coma-inducing drugs.  We got to keep my father in our lives until this past fall, when he died of an unrelated cause.  I never mentioned the paper to my father. 

I only showed the paper to my wife,' but what the hell, I could just draw up a new one if i wanted to make shit up, right?

Anyway, and it's still really, really jarring to think about.  A I-wish-it-hadn't-happened level of jarring.  And I know there's no direct way to link the 'information' on the paper to his accident, but it's really just, too much for me to write off.  

Thanks so much for reading this


edit: grammar

TL;DR: I predicted my father falling and fracturing his skull the night before it happened.

This happened several years ago when me and my friends were in seventh grade, it started off normal nothing out of the ordinary, we went through every room and and asked some questions, when we thought we were done we realized we left the door to my room open, so thinking the ghost may have gone in there we went in there to finish the night.

Once in the room we all sat in a circle near the door, setting down the lighter next to them and shut off the light, we then blew out the candles leaving the only light in the basement a small pin prick of light from my tape recorder.

1322029473.0,mmgfr,[ME][FR] Why I won't sleep at her house,Foobeh,36,0,13,"So I've written about this only once before. This isn't a copy/paste of that story
This occurred in our Sophomore year of high school in mid May.

My friend's name is Emilee. She's very different from me

Emilee's house is around 130 years old. I had stayed over at her house a number of times
Note that her deck is newer than the rest of her house. It was built by her father
Anyway, so I agreed to stay in the bigger living room and watch tv. 

I always felt uncomfortable when alone in her house. Her whole family agreed that there are a few spirits there. A young boy who died of pneumonia, especially when sitting on the couch so late. Her sister and her parents were all out of town, so I couldn't talk to them. I called my (now ex) boyfriend and spoke with him for a while, when I heard a weird noise coming from the deck. It was short, almost sounded like boxes of glass being shifted. My call dropped. The lightbulb over my head burst.

Scared
As I'm sure you've noticed,"" she said, reading my mind. 
""Well,"" I responded.
We brushed it off and went back into the big living room. As we settled down on the couch and got ready to sleep
The fan turned on. The switch is in the master bedroom.

I was getting scared out of my mind already. Emilee wasn't really phased
We started to calm down again
I still thought maybe Emilee was fucking with me; she likes to pull shit like this all the time.

But then
The noises coming from that deck were INSANE. It sounded like a toddler throwing a fit
But the noises were still there. A strange hissing noise accompanied the crashing. I started crying

We ran into the kitchen, but on the way I checked the bathroom.

There were no marks on the mirror.



The crashing continued through the night

After a couple minutes I opened my eyes and the woman was still there. I blinked a few times just to make sure I wasn't seeing things and the woman didn't move. I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to startle whoever was standing there so I didn't move for a couple more minutes, but the person did not go away from the foot of my bed. At this point I've had enough and was getting freaked out so I turned to click on the lamp and when I turned my head back the lady was gone. 

My head was turned for no more than a second and there was no one at the foot of my bed anymore. But for some reason I wasn't freaked out  anymore. It was creepier for me to think that my mom was watching me sleep than some ghost was.

**Three weeks ago**

My roommate and I were hanging out and talking spirituality. We're both fairly into this stuff and he explained to me that he likes to keep any mattresses or free beds open for whatever spirits are out by pulling the covers. He doesn't try to invite them into our lives

**Two weeks ago**

My roommate is having trouble sleeping for three nights. On the third night, so he gets up off his bed to see if he's causing it somehow. Nope, still there. He hops back into bed and is still uncomfortable in his same spot so he moves over to the right and immediately feels comfort. He explains it like he was sharing the bed with someone else. Within ten minutes he passes out.

Next morning he asks me if I remember why he keeps an extra mattress. I tell him I do. He then points at this mattress we have at the end of our living room that we keep on the floor for friends who need a place to crash. For the past three nights

**The next night**

My girlfriend comes over and we're laying on my bed as I explain to her the creepiness that just happened to my friend. As I'm telling her, we're on the couch watching Netflix and the light on the **lamp next to me starts flickering**. I've NEVER seen it do this.

The next morning she tells me before she went to sleep, positioning on the bed, and my room, and someone had opened the door, YELLING for me to get up and get out. She said she vividly remembers this person was **angry**, she thought it was one of my friends but it wasn't, and that the anger was directed at me.

I tell this story to my roommate (static shadow guy) the next night while we're on the couch. As I'm telling him this, nothing.

**The next night**

It's 11pm, no one is there. Before I continue, let me be clear that **I did NOT imagine this**. I wasn't thinking about anything paranormal or freaking myself out. I distinctly heard the word 'hey' being said. My cat is running around outside my kitchen door and as I take a step towards him, he runs to the end of the hall to where my bathroom is and gets in a *defensive pounce position*. I walk over to my room, which is close to the bathroom and he isn't running away, he's still in pounce position and *his focus is still on the kitchen*.

**Last night/This morning**

We threw a party at our place. After the party (around 4am), just getting ready for bed and he swears to have heard it right behind him.

My other roommate said he talked to one of the guys who came at the end of the party who's really knowledgeable when it comes to spiritual stuff like this. He said something along the lines of our **energies are imbalanced** in this apartment, but here's the freaky bit: as my roommate is telling me this, we go to his room where he shows me a Buddhist scroll that he used to have hanging on his wall. One of the nails is out and it's now now laying on the floor. It reads (and I shit you not):

&gt;*Peace comes when energies are in harmony and relationships are in balance*

The house I lived in from age 2-8 was just your average house, my parents rational was that if there was a fire they could grab me and run out the door easier.  Well, from as young as I can remember I would see shadow people in my room at night.  Not just one person but a group, walking around, like they were pacing or circling the room.  If I got up to go to the bathroom they would follow me.  For whatever reason, I was never afraid of this.  Tried to ask my mom about it and she told me my eyes were ""playing tricks"" on me or I was dreaming, I stopped talking to her about it. The only time I ever became scared in that house was when my parents were away on a business trip, as I looked around my room the shadow people  were over by the side door just standing there and their non movement is what freaked me out.  I ran into my parents room where my grandma was sleeping and slept with her the rest of the night.  A few days after my dad got back he noticed that it looked like someone had tried to pry the deadbolt open on the side door.

When I was in kindergarten my mom would pull me out of school to go on picnics every once in awhile.  Our favorite spot was at this creek where there was this old stone bridge. Every once in a while I would hear these loud booms but my mom never heard them. Years later I think that it was probably the sound of cannons.

At age fourteen my first dog, I was the one that was holding him while he passed.  I was pretty devastated and cried all night.  That night I had a dream about him coming home and jumping into bed with me.

Some context; this happened in 1998. I was seven years old at the time
I barely remember the incidents that happened here

It all starts on a late Autumn night. My mother, and my grandmother were returning home from a secluded picnic day-out to a quiet beauty spot about an hour and a half drive away from home; a valley called Abergwesyn. On the way back we would generally take the longer route home via the very narrow country roads as we could pass through the village of Llangammarch which was a favourite haunt of my grandmother when she was a teenager and would generally be accompanied by a funny story.  It was very dark, approaching 8pm, and it had clouded over; so the country backroad was completely devoid of illumination apart from the car headlights. We're driving pretty slow. I was asleep in the back, cuddled up to my grandmother, while my parents are in the front with the radio quietly on.

Suddenly, or unusual, straight away, to whomever is present; and so immediately tells my father that she thinks a car is following them. He glances out of his mirror, and sees nothing. But my mother is insistent that there is a reflection of something behind us.

My grandmother now chips in and agrees with my mother that she too can see something out of the back window. My father still tries to tell them that they are wrong

A few minutes pass. And then my mother exclaims; ""Look! It's a registration plate!"" Behind our car, my father still can't see a thing and is beginning to get aggravated at the entire situation, and I wake up and wonder WTF is going on. 

My mother is getting hysterical, wound down my window and poked my head out the back. I exclaim that I can see the outlines of tire arches and can hear another car over the wind and the sound of our engine.

Mother begins to panic again, all sorts). Through this commotion, we miss the turning we needed to get back to our town. My father, totally exasperated, slows down making for a gate in which he can turn the car around in. I look back and see I can no longer see the outline of any car. Everyone goes silent as we begin to execute a three point turn. The headlights flash around and illuminate...nothing. The road is empty behind us. There was no way any car could have gotten past us without us knowing, and there was nowhere else for a car to go, as high and thick edges blocked the road in on either side. My father, continues down the right road for home.

About 5 minutes pass, and the surroundings are, if not visible, are just about discernible. And then I see it again. A car, definitely a car, quietly pulling up behind us. It's close, very close. Our white taillights are shining off of its registration plate and the chrome around the engine. I can just about make out the edges of the windscreen
I quietly whisper to my grandmother what I can see, as he can now see it too. We all begin to debate what to do. My father and grandmother want to stop at the nearest farm we come too, but my mother absolutely forbids him and just wants to get home as soon as possible. I'm keeping a constant vigil on the car behind us. After a while we all agree to just keep driving until we get to the well lit village of Llangammarch, which should be fairly soon. Minutes go by. The car behind us stays with us, only about a metre away. Keeping up with our pace; not dropping back, not coming any nearer. 

Everyone is pretty much silent by this point, almost hitting us. It comes within inches of our back bumper. My father, who has also been keeping an eye, shouts out, and accelerates to compensate, while my mother lets out a brief shriek and my grandmother holds me tight. We are now having to go uncomfortably fast for the road conditions, definitely breaking the speed limit, albeit too fast a pace

The rest of the journey goes by totally uneventfully. We soon turn onto a road with semi-regular streetlights. I keep on clamouring and asking questions, explain the events of that night.

I only experienced it for few seconds but I know what I saw. 2 hands grabbed my ankles. These hands were pale, not dead skin pale but very pale. They belonged to a girl who was floating. There was no sound, only a calm feeling (that's the best way I can put it). I was instantly back in my real body, felt a ""hypnotic jerk"" and everything went black.

Please note the basement was a bit lower than what is shown in the picture. There was a lot more space around the door.

If that wasn't eerie enough, told her that I had fallen and then I fell asleep for few hours (it was bright and sunny when I was outside, I woke up at dusk).

I live in rural Northern Ireland, my father thought it would be fine if his children were brought up there to. My dad and uncles would occasionally tell us strange stories about what happened to them whilst growing up, things like banshees, poltergeists and weird things like my uncle seeing the ghost of a young girl hanging herself on a tree near the house. They always said the farm used to be a workhouse in famine times, a terrible place where farmers slaved for hours to earn a pittance, but I usually didn't believe these stories, I just enjoyed the chills I would get from listening to them.

One night I was working late, this did not include the little rural area I lived in. My friend at work kindly offered to leave me at the bottom of our road, for it has a sharp incline (we call it the 'brae', Gaelic for hill) and it was covered with ice; my parents could not get out of our house to lift me.

My friend dropped me of at the bottom of our road and I began my walk home. I had about half a mile to go; not bad under normal conditions, and was glad that I wasn't in the dark anymore, but soon I came to the last house and the last light faded away behind me. I was back in the dark.

I approached the area where my father and his family grew up and I immediately thought of everything I was ever told about the area. My hair was on end, I padded on through the snow and kept thinking about the next house which would come up.

Suddenly I heard three, my heel even,  like something was trying to take it off or grab hold. My eyes stared wide and I ran like I never ran before. As I ran I kept thinking that I should look back, that I had to make sure it was real and not something else... But I couldn't.  I was too scared. I sort of felt that that would've been the stupid thing to do.

I finally made it to my house and I ran inside and slammed the door. I told my mom about it, but I have decided it couldn't have been because they would have said to me it was them and that they enjoyed scaring me shitless. I know it wasn't a stranger, because why would anyone be out there in the middle of the night, in the snow, waiting to grab someone's foot?

To get started

During the night shift we would generally work 12 hour shifts so we would try and sleep as much as we could. This night it was particularly slow so everyone was in a pretty good mood. I was friends with the other crew (we went to medic school together and he got me the job essentially). I was asleep in the back of the ambulance on the bench seat and the two others were asleep in the front. I was awoken to a loud bang against the side of the unit. It sounded as if somebody took both of their hands and slammed them against the side of the ambulance as hard as they could. This happened to be the side of the unit that the bench was on so I not only heard it, being a bit stubborn, got out of the unit and looked around to investigate. Mind you, it had to be 3-4 am in the morning at this time. A second or two later he knocked on the back door so I would come out. We looked around for a minute and did not see anything unusual. The 'mood' was tense and we were on our toes. We decided to just leave the area and go get some coffee at a gas station. On the drive over to the gas station my friend and his partner (also his wife) talked about how they have had quite a few 'unusual' experiences in this ambulance. Actually they said that it was definitely 'haunted' and said they have seen faces in the reflections of the glass among other things. To this day I don't know if there was an angry thug kicking the side of the ambulance and running off or if we encountered something paranormal.

1317391388.0,kwghp,I'm part of a ghost hunting team: Here are my experiences -- Pt III,darkangelle,31,0,16,"*I was going to hold off on posting this for until I was able to fix the recording
  
.  
This happened to us about 2 months ago. We've been attacked, nothing tops this experience. I'm not sure what makes it *so* scary to me. It could be the place. It could be the ambiance there. Maybe it's just so full of dark energy that it emanates. Even though we were only there for about an hour or so, it was enough. It began as soon as we arrived, it didn't even give us a chance to get accustomed to the darkness.  
.  
We had visited this spot once before, cloudless day. As night set in, it continued to be clear and lovely. It was a great night to be outside as the moon was clearly seen and it provided enough light. We reached the spot, parked our cars, got our equipment and began our 6 minute walk.   
Not even 2 steps into the tiny road... we were met with a sudden torrential downpour of rain. Out of nowhere
We were faced with a dilemma
Walking down a road that's not even wide enough for one car, with just 1 flashlight... it was not a fun time.  
Especially when the area is covered in over 5 foot tall grass. You almost *feel* them looking at you. You don't dare look into the tall grass because you just *know* you're going to look into the eyes of something you don't want to look into.  
.  
Because of the torrential rain, we couldn't see it. As soon as we stepped into the building, the rain subsided. We were cold and completely soaked and decided to just call it a night and head back out.  
We walked all the way back and decided to return another night.  
This experience begins on that second visit.  
.  
This time the group was a little bigger. It was 3 couples:  
B &amp; C
Even after visiting the same place so many different times
A &amp; E are fairly new to the group and they're still quite sensitive and scare very easily. That's not to say that *any* of us aren't scared at every moment. We are. We all jump at sounds
.  
To start off, you can also see the long road we must walk to get to it. It is a very tiny road, a car will not pass through it. As you can also see, it's a very desolate area.  
Just before the trail
We weren't supposed to go ""hunting"" on this night. We were just there because A &amp; E had never been there and we had talked about it many times before
.  
It didn't rain on us this night but it had rained earlier in the week and the trail was pretty muddy. About 25 feet into the trail, and I followed. Slowly crossing through the grass and mud. This is when, to my right, I heard a ... grunt? It was a male grunt/throat clear. I'm not sure how to describe it. It was quite loud though, but when I heard it, I payed not attention to it. I guess mud on my toes was slightly more important at the moment.  
After crossing our little ""road block"", we will huddle together and hold hands or link our arms together while we walk. This makes us feel better as no one stays behind and we know who's standing next to us at all times.  
As we kept heading forward, something he said pierced all my thoughts and flashed red lights in my mind.  
*""There's also been some people who claim to have heard Juan
I almost hyperventilated. I stopped dead in my tracks and I asked him to make the sound that these people heard.  
The sound he made was *the exact same thing I had just heard*.  
I immediately let him know that I had just heard it, while I just felt increasingly like running far away from this place.  
.  
As we walked farther into the darkness
We were told about how this land used to be part of a large Hacienda
.  
Our light-heartedness didn't last for very long. Right in front of the path towards the ruins
No
It was in horrible shape. Normally
The closer to you got to it, the smell was horrifying. We toyed with the idea of calling the Police for quite a while. The group was divided between wanting to call the Police and not wanting to call the Police and just go home.  
We just tried to ignore it for a bit and stood around
.  
We tried to make the most of our outing before deciding what to do with the car. We faced a big issue. The grass was way too tall for us. We didn't feel safe walking into over 5' tall grass as we couldn't see anything and it would render us very vulnerable to any one who *may* be out there. As we were standing around, swaying movement that happens when you walk through grass. There was *no* breeze and this was just one small patch *directly in front of us*.  
The eerie part is that it kept moving. It seemed to keep coming *towards* us until we flashed a light on it and it stopped.  
.  
B took out his EMF detector and began to *taunt* whatever was out there. I'm usually very against taunting these things, over and over. Our pulses were racing. Then, suddenly, to our left from within the trees... a small girl's *giggle*. It was very loud and clear. We all turned towards it together and were very startled.  
This is the point where my boyfriend took his phone and began to record.  
I was taking pictures left and right but I wasn't capturing anything at all
This is when C mentioned that she felt like something touched her back
.  
We began to doubt if this was a good idea whatsoever
It is a sound I will never forget. Imagine the sound of a woman being split open and having her guts pulled out one by one. It was a gurgled
If I had to guess
This is where I started to lose it. I was *not comfortable* at all anymore. I began to hyperventilate and this was caught on audio. As soon as the scream ends
That was pretty much my breaking point. I wanted to leave then and there but the guys insisted we stay a little longer.  
We walked around for a while, I saw a face staring at me through the grass. It was very low on the ground, I'd say about 2 feet off the ground, peering up at us with a malicious look on it's face.  
After a while of no more happenings
We headed over to the Police department and let them know what we found.  
They sent 2 patrols and they headed in
We were never told what they found.  
.  

My boyfriend and I still have the recording but upon inspecting it
So, let us know so we can upload it.  
We'd love to share it!

1374710196.0,1izqzc,Our friend Kurt [fam][me],alphabet-town,39,10,10,"Hello again friends


A few years ago
She would have very morbid dreams about suicide and sometimes she would hear people screaming her name in her head as she slept.
One early morning, even a little curious.
He never looked at her, with a baggy flannel shirt. He had scruffy brown hair and reminded her of someone who might've been a fan of Nirvana in the 90's. For this reason Katy and I have nicknamed him Kurt.
I'm just going to add that I am **NOT** saying that this is the ghost of Kurt Cobain. All I'm saying is


Katy sat up in bed and Kurt faded away. She saw him in her bedroom again a few months later.


Maybe in his life
The first one was when Katy was home alone watching TV


In our living room
I often hear footsteps begin to walk as I'm playing. A few times when home alone I have thought ""Oh! Dad &amp; Katy must be home because I can hear their footsteps."" only for nobody to arrive.
I feel a presence as I play
Katy has said there have been a couple of occasions she has heard the clinking of glasses an a man laughing and talking coming from our empty living room.
Again


A few years have passed
Katy is now in therapy and is doing a lot better. The latest encounter with Kurt came a few weeks ago.
She was in her therapy session, not specifically paranormal) . The therapist, without any encouragement from Katy said ""Do you think your house is haunted?""
Katy briefly mentioned her encounter with Kurt.
The therapist said, because he's actually here."" Katy was shocked. The therapist continued, ""He's sitting right next to you, he's all dressed up wearing a suit.""
Katy was dumbfounded


I was also shocked when she relayed the story to me later and it still puzzles me when I think back on it. I thought therapists weren't supposed to believe in ghosts. Aren't they all about science? Wouldn't seeing apparitions be a sign of mental illness to a therapist?
At the very least I found it surprising she would discuss it with a client.
I think it gave Katy comfort that she wasn't crazy. The therapist wondered if maybe he was her guardian.


But the day wasn't over. Again
As Katy left the therapist's office that day
She was barely out the front gate when she started to feel faint
She shrugged it off
She kept walking
She didn't go back to the therapist's office


There's no way to know for sure, warning her there was someone waiting to stalk her.


I'm sorry if this story is rambling
Both Katy and I are curious to know more about Kurt and his history but so far we have no luck.
The history of our house is clean for the last decade
Assuming Kurt really is from the 80s - 90s era, so I'm wondering if he is connected to her for some reason.

1371947010.0,1gvtbh,Remote thrown from my ceiling [ME],burntflowersfallen,38,9,9,"This has bothered me for years now and I figured I'd get other peoples views on it. Back when I was twelve I lived in this really small town in Ohio and my house had a lot of weird things that would go on. Doors would shut themselves

But anyways one night I was looking around my room for my remote which I usually leave on my pillow but for some reason that night it was gone and I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked my bed over a dozen times and even moved all the blankets and my pillows but still couldn't find it. After maybe fifteen minutes I gave up and just turned off my lights and ran to jump onto my bed. I was laying on my back looking up at the ceiling when out of nowhere my remote came at my face and landed right next to my head. All my brain could have time to process was my remote coming at me from the darkness of my ceiling. My blood ran cold and I jumped out of my bed so fast throwing the remote and I won't lie I was basically crying I was so terrified.

I tried so hard to write it off as totally not real but I just couldn't rationalize it. And then about two week later I had my friend C over spending the night and we were alone in the house other than my mother. So we're just sitting talking school and dumb stuff when my cell phone starts ringing and it's my home phone calling me. I think 'oh that's weird' but it's probably just my mother being lazy from across the house and I answer it and no one's on the other line it's just dead air. We walk out to my mothers room to see what she wants and she's asleep and now we get really creeped out. We wake her up and make her go find the home phone with us and it's now off the hook and sitting out on the couch face up still on the line.

It's safe to say I'm glad I no longer live there because it scared the hell out of me to be alone. This isn't the only stuff that happened but these are the two that to this day still give me goosebumps to think about.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gvtbh/remote_thrown_from_my_ceiling_me/

Now on to a story that has, it felt as though the covers were ripped off of me. It took me a couple seconds to realize I was freezing. I then felt around my bed and realized I was freezing because there was absolutely nothing on the bed, I was sleeping straight on top of the mattress. I sleep in the pitch black dark and so I got up and had to feel my way to the light switch. When I turned on the lights, it looked like a bomb had gone off in my room. Things were scattered everywhere, including the linens from my bed. Two pillows were set against the door. One pillow was behind my television, and another pillow was inside my closet underneath a box. My comforter was draped over a chair and my sheets were on the other side of the room on the floor. The dresser drawers were all open, too. I quickly began picking everything up and putting it back on my bed. My father opened my door and said ""what the hell is going on in here?"" I just shrugged and told him I didn't know. He said it sounded like ""a damn warzone"" from downstairs. My mother came in the room too
  
The next day, noises coming from my room. He said sometimes it sounded like footsteps pacing, but other times it definitely sounded like people talking. He investigated a few times, but quit looking after never finding the source of the noise. Over the years, other people have told me the same thing, but I've always just ignored it. My sister-in-law got really really freaked out about it once. She was napping in the guest bedroom next to mine when she woke up and heard what sounded like someone stomping around my room. Again, I was away at college at the time and so she knew nobody was in there. Our dog was there with her and she ran out of the room and went downstairs when this started. Another thing, she likes to go in all the rooms and sleep on the beds (my parents let that dog do whatever she wants). But she never comes in my room

1353513488.0,13kjad,[ME] Figures falling down during a storm.,Vinegar_Tom,46,13,12,"I was catching up on this subreddit when I remembered this weird experience from university. The rain outside coupled with the creepy stories must have triggered it - had I recalled it sooner

I was 20 I think, like a corner office.  

One evening it was particularly stormy. I was watching the lightning outside when I saw a bolt strike the apartment across from mine. Everything went dark as the power went out - I guess it hit a key power source or something.  With the power out, the lightning flashed and I saw the silhouette of what looked like an upside-down person falling towards the rooftop of that same apartment; another flash and I saw another falling much farther away into the wooded park area that surrounded the complex.  I kind of paused, thinking my brain was trying to rationalize abstract images by making them into human-figures.  It was when a black shape seemed to fall down right by *my* window out of the corner of my eye that I shut the blinds and hopped into my bed on the other side of the room. I could think up logical excuses, but I was still freaked out.  A few days later I was still thinking about it on and off, but didn't find it especially troubling. 

It doesn't quite end though.  I went to my room a few days later and saw a shape standing in my room, I didn't feel afraid and approached it. It didn't move. In fact, once I got close, I didn't see it anymore, though when I stepped back I did.  I thought it was a bizarre trick of the light at this point (like a reflection) and sort of went about my business.

A few hours later I went out of my room to use the bathroom (I think this was the reason anyway) and when I came back, I wonder?  Or maybe the stress from term papers was making me see things?

At about three a.m. I awoke from a deep sleep terrified. I shot up and put my hand on my wife’s face (not out of rudeness) because she was trying to tell me something. I was trying to get her to quiet down because I could distinctly hear laughter outside of our room. Not just any laughter, she told me she could and that is why she was trying to wake me up.

That morning we checked out and at the hotel desk they have a large book to write down paranormal experiences. I had my wife record our encounter and out of curiosity I asked if any children were on that floor and we were told there weren’t. 

Obviously it is easy to dismiss. It could have been our minds playing tricks on us based off of what we knew or kids playing

When she was young and it was Holy Week or Halloween (I don't remember when she said this happened)

On one of these occasions, and it's where you get to all the other rooms upstairs.

So my grandmother did as she was told and so did all the other kids. The men started shouting and moving outside the house while the women ran up the stairs too.

Then

When it was completely dark

The women prayed louder and the thumping and scratching got more desperate

The noise outside and the nonstop chanting of prayers really terrified my grandmother but to add to that, ""Get away from here you monster, you aren't taking any of the children!""

I'd been reading about the out-of-body experience for about a year, with ""vibrations,"" which are a a sensation strongly associated with the beginning of an out-of-body experience. It basically feels like it sounds, as if you're body's vibrating, not terribly unlike a motor running. 

One morning, I reach my arms through an outside wall of a building and pull myself through. As I go through, I have a strong eureka moment, as if I'd figured something out, but I would never remember what.

I woke up with vibrations and, basically floating in the center of my field of vision. I had the notion at the time that it was a visible version of the vibration sensation (rhyming *and* alliteration!).

For me, but feed off the destruction in some way. As a disclaimer, I first discovered this theory when reading Dean Koontz’ Odd Thomas. It rang true for me, and after many observations and discussions with other sensitives, this theory seems pretty valid.

On to the experience!

On Thanksgiving of 2005, but our eyes adjusted quickly and we could see pretty well. We walked for a little while, not really paying attention to where we were. After an hour or so we decided to head back to the house. On our way back, I see the most Shadow People I have ever seen in the same place. Across the way was a large piece of desert that looked like it was going to be the site of a new development of houses. There were probably one to two dozen Shadow People just milling about in that area. I stiffened and my husband, who is familiar with my experiences, asks me what is wrong and I whisper (not wanting my professor and his family to hear) what I see. Needless to say, we picked up the pace. 

I spent the next three days glued to the news channel just waiting to hear what tragedy caused all of those Shadow People. Nothing. Nothing happens. I shrug it off eventually

1333656412.0,rv4zx,[Me][FAM] Some old experiences I posted on nosleep before I knew about this sub,,34,5,1,"When I was around 5-7

Now to help you guys visualize, and it leads to a utility room which is attached to the garage. There is a pool table in the garage.

So all of a sudden, and the sound of the balls clacking, rolling across the table and going in the hole, everything. The thing is, I'm not hearing it from the garage. I'm hearing it as if it's happening in my room. It's as if every little detail of sound was amplified directly to my ears. I'm about to freak out when I hear my mom and dad rush into the kitchen and told them what I what I was hearing. My mom told me that they were hearing the same thing (amplified to them all the way in the living room). As we were talking, the sounds were still going on.

My dad had his shotgun and was making his way to the door that leads to the garage, the sounds stopped abruptly. Nothing in the garage was moved, nothing out of place. All the equipment was in its place. Yeah, didn't sleep too easy that night.

The other story is about something my mom and my aunt experienced. My mom and my aunt used to spend time at their grandparents house often and stay over at night (especially during the summers). The house was way out in the sticks and very old.

My mom says that once when she was around 5 (the 70's btw) she rested her head on her pillow and thought she heard a muffled sound. So she turned her head and pressed her ear into it. And what she heard was the sounds of a party. She heard what sounded like a crowded party with so many people talking

Now the pillow wasn't a sleeping pillow

Now fast forward a few years and her she was 10ish and her sister would be around 15. My aunt one night slept with that exact same pillow and heard the exact same things. Apparently she told my mom in the morning and my mom confessed that she heard the exact same thing years before. The thing is

1375024483.0,1j7ule,Two haunted houses [ME] [FAM],ZaLordsGuard,39,8,7,"Yesterday, neither of these ghosts were/are negative and these are not spooooooooky stories

House 1: 
When I was ten, and most of them had been different things at different times. The house we moved into had a general store in it when it was built, and the proprietors lived upstairs. So there was a lot of foot traffic, as you can imagine. Despite being so old, we were only the third owners of the house, the previous owner had it for almost eighty years, and had passed it down. It was being sold because the last heir had gone into assisted living. When we bought the house, dented cans from the fifties

Soon, and the into the kitchen. We'd hear this at least once a week, lather, rinse, repeat.
None of us were particularly hung up about this because we were renovating the house at the time

And then he (heavy footsteps, because at least one weekend night a week, one of them would be sleeping in the guest room, stewing angrily. On those nights, Mr. M (we called him after the man who built the house) would PACE up and down the stairs. From the hallway, to the landing, to the guest room door
He would mess with my radio, so that when music started playing again, it would be George Strait, and not Nirvana. There would never be any kind of squealing or hissing, like you'd get when you turn the dial, either. On those occasions, I would turn the radio off and go downstairs. 
Mr. M could be helpful, I would wake up to a knocking on my door. I'd get up, stumble to the door, and no one would be there, of course. But I'd be up on time. 
My sister saw him once, and when we moved, we were kind of sad to leave him.

House the second:

We moved when I was eighteen. I went to my first, but I stay there on occasion to pet-sit. Most of these experiences are not mine.

The minute my parents moved into this house, and they were both very aware of SOMETHING. So much so that they would state their intentions before coming in to do work, something like ""Hello, I'm just coming in to paint/fix the lights/put up drywall"". Before they'd moved in, my father was in my brother's room, on a ladder, painting. According to him, gradually, and hightailed it out of there.

He told everyone that before they moved in, they asked their neighbors if they knew of anything weird going on in the house.
The neighbors all said the same thing, too.
This little girl, in (what else) a white dress. At the time my parents were moving in, my sister was eight and blond. So at first, my parents would think they'd see my sister sitting on the stairs, only to find her in her room. I don't mean to imply that this was a doppelgänger, only that in passing, they looked the same. Once in a while, along with high pitched giggles. My sister has since grown
In fact, he just wanted my dad to know. 
In my own experience, they've got pets and our great grandfather lives with them as well, so when my family goes away, I come down and stay. I've seen the dog start to greet something I can't see, followed by a little giggle, as if to say ""you're so silly, dog"". 
Lastly
No one is afraid of the house (except for that creeptastic shadow thing of Dads) and my family just takes it in stride ""yes, I don't know if they attract things necessarily, or this is just par for the course if you live in an old neighborhood. But for now, no one has investigated the house because they still live there, and if something gets stirred up, they'd still have to live with it. My mother has done some research on the house, but hasn't found much, we found a filing cabinet full of Masonic ledgers with meeting minutes in them. Not relevant

I lived in Longridge at the time, and I only lived in this house from being 16 to nearly 18. The cottage I lived in was very old: I don't have an exact date, but it was hundreds of years. I lived here with my mother, who, if you've read my previous post, is quite the skeptic.

We moved into that house in October 2008 (I think), and one night in November a friend and I were watching television when we saw not a face, but a white mist that *suggested* a face, if that makes any sense, at this window. 
We tried to reason that it was a cat, condensation (there are a lot of reasonable explanations) but we couldn't shake this utter feeling of terror. We both became quite hysterical and had to telephone our friend to drive over from the next village to turn the dining room light on as we were too scared to. I didn't go home until the morning.

In this house, making the overall house kind of an L shape, with the newer bit leading into the garden. My bedroom was at the back of the old house, directly above where the front door of the original house (now the window discussed above) was. For about five months, every morning at 6:03 exactly I was woken up by knocking, that I assumed to be at our front door.

Having gone downstairs and found nobody at this door (or going into the front bedroom and looking down if I felt scared!) quite a few times, however, and I soon realised that the knocking wasn't at the front door, but at the window beneath my room. I never saw anyone down there, though.

Other things I experienced in this house included hearing music from ipods, only to find them switched off when I went to turn them off, and once, terrifyingly, seeing a male face on the television, only to look again and see that it was off. I was too frightened to tell my mother about any of this in the house, as I had a feeling that whatever was there would hear me. I was terrified and stressed, I was really happy

Just before my 18th birthday, but that we liked being nearer to work/college/family... when my mum asked me to tell her what it was I had wanted to tell her but couldn't when we lived in the cottage. When I told her about everything - the electronics, the window, my strong feeling that there was something awful in the house, she looked weirded out and proceeded to tell me something that, from her own admission, she wouldn't when we lived there as she knew that I would never go back inside if she did.

My mother, that she doesn't believe in ghosts, was also terrified without real reason of that window. Shortly before we decided to move, she was sitting alone at night and saw a man through the window. Remember that our garden was enclosed and that the man was standing where I heard the knocking and where the old front door was.

He was wearing a flat cap and waistcoat - clothing that in Lancashire is very traditional and could basically come from any era. He was walking towards the modern extension, he was gone and there was nobody in the garden. I know this is speculation, but I don't think he was aware of the newer bit of the house and still operates on the old boundaries.

We moved in to the house when I was a year and a half. I have vague recollections of the house's original format pre-renovation. The house and its outdated oddities had always fascinated me. I couldn't say when the odd things began to happen for me, somethings can't always be easily explained away. 

I vividly recall, because my bed was shaking. Something had begun to shake my bed and only my bed moved. I remember building the courage to dash to the hallway and my parents room next door. I remember my cat watching from the doorway, concerned. I remember how my room appeared in the glow of my nightlight. But most of all I remember launching myself from my bed, to my parents room, who promptly told me to go back to bed, and that my cat Scrappy would protect me. When I returned to my room, terrified to linger in the hall

Around this time I used to be awoken some mornings by a voice calling my name. Maybe it was a dream. But I vividly recall a voice calling my name from the driveway in the early morning beneath my window. I'd be awoken by it. At that point my bed was beside the window, and each time a man would look back up at me. He was old timey looking, in a brown coarse suit and a fedora. He looked like a vacuum cleaner salesmen. And he stood beside a yellow taxi cab, one of the older ones from New York City. He'd stand beside his taxi and call my name, begging me to come down. 

He terrified me. I would hide under my blanket until he went away. Maybe he was a recurring nightmare. Maybe he was the product of my imagination. I don't really know. But there was something about his smile

When I was 19, I'll call him 'M' for this story, was smoking trees and I had just opened my second beer and we were waiting on two more of our friends to come out. It was an incredibly pleasant night for camping, perfect weather, clear sky. It was about an hour after sundown and we had just got our camp set up and were chilling listening to music. Procrastination at it's best. Our campsite was literally /our/ campsite. It was far back in the more difficult to reach area where you either need to hike for miles or have a serious off-road capable vehicle. It's at the base of a train bridge that spans about 500ft, with the bridge being about 100ft above the river bottom and sheer cliffs on either side. 

Many times we would be camping and trains would go across at night, they would always slow down before traversing so it's usually at a crawl. This night we happened to look up and see bright lights over the rim of the cliff. Thinking it was just a train we waited and watched until the train crested over the rim. That was when I noticed that the bright lights over the rim didn't progress along with the front engine when we actually saw the train. The front car had it's own lights but the night sky was still lit up like there was still a train coming. Like I said, normally the conductors would wave and honk their horns but this one was silent, even when we shined our lights up at them. Then I saw it, hovering above the train and moving at a slower pace was a something that took my breath away. If I had to guess it was about 15ft above the train and had all kinds of lights onboard. We both stood there and stared at it until it was about perpendicular to us, then it stopped. 'M' started walking towards it with a look on his face that could only be described as wonder, kind of like the look on Apu's face in Aladdin when they first go into the cave of wonder. When he got closer to the bridge it slid to the opposite side, which was still moving btw. After he got back to where I was standing a spotlight came down from the craft onto us

I don't remember if 'M' had the same experience because all I could see was the light. Then the spotlight turned off and the craft started moving along with the train again. About 3/4 of the way across the bridge the craft veered off and climbed at a crazy speed until we couldn't see it any more. After the thing disappeared it took quite a few minutes for me to get my mind right again. The phrase 'we've been chosen to tell everyone' kept repeating in my head for some reason. Naturally one doesn't go and plan on telling people anything along those lines unless you want to be branded as a crazy. 'M' and I had no explanation for what happened so the following conversation didn't progress past ""did you see that dude?"" I told him what I was thinking, so until tonight I haven't mentioned it to anyone. Another thing we noticed was that the portable stereo we were listening to somehow lost all power sometime during the event, the batteries in it were dead along with the extras we brought with us. The clock in his truck also reset and the battery had to be jumped the next morning. It didn't have enough power left to turn over, only to barely run the electronics.

I'm fairly new to this subreddit and I've been lurking on all these fabulous stories quite a bit. I figured it was time to share one of my own. Let me start out by saying this story is true

I was seventeen, I was with my boyfriend of two years. We were driving a route we commoned that was between my parents' house and his. I was driving the little five-speed '93 toyota tercel that I had at the time, and we were driving down the 'speedtrap hill' that was famous at my high school. At the bottom of the hill was a rather large pond that some of my naughtier friends and I used to smoke weed at pretty regularily. Across the street from the pond was a half built, deserted luxury subdivision called 'the shire.' It was all lord of the rings themed, and it was a common 'meet up' place for friends. ANYWAY, on this particular night (it was probably around 12am) my boyfriend and I were driving down the hill and all of a sudden I saw a light up ahead, in the woods by the side of the road. It wasn't just a light though, but as we got closer the figure got more defined. It looked like a small deer, or bucked. The only way I can describe it is, it retreated

I have avoided that route ever since

Our room was the first door on the left after exiting the stairs. The dorm room was rather spacious with a bedroom separated from our common room followed by the bathroom. Even though there was 3 of us

The study room always had a heavy feeling

After only a month of living together, the shower curtain would rattle. However, we never actually saw anything happen. It was only ever noises. We did have a fan in the bedroom, but we would only ever turn it on at night. We only ever heard sounds while we were awake. Chalk it up to people in other rooms making the noises or leaving a window open, but the walls were thick and I will be damned if the wind was moving things. The three of us know what it was. 

We had a couch and three desks in our common room, no music, just silently doing our homework. From the bedroom it sounded like someone had just flopped onto the bed. We looked at each other, assuming one of us had disappeared into the bedroom. After seeing that the three of us were still in the room, we decided to check it out. Nothing. The girl looked up at us and said, “Must be Fred the friendly ghost”.

From that point on whenever we heard a sound, except for one instance.

We were coming back from dinner on south campus. As it was a long walk down there, a few people confused at why I had stopped. My roommate jiggled the handle, expecting the door to open, but it was still locked. My other roommate knocked on the door, looked at us and said “Who the hell is in our room?” We could clearly hear someone walking around in the room, but no one was responding.

I mustered as much courage as I could and unlocked the door. As I turned the key, I flicked on the lights and we quickly scouted the room. After discovering that no one was there, we realized it must have been Fred. For the rest of the night we joked about Fred and let him know he pulled a good one on us.

Gosh, there were so many stars out that night. As we were staring into those billions of stars, it seemed like something wasn't right.... like something bad was going to happen. We noticed that the ""stars"" were moving. In a circle.Not your average twinkles. They were fucking moving in a 'filled-in' circle. Two of the ""stars"" started dropping down at astounding speed. We both thought that we were just tired and seeing things. Nope, they began to how you say.., 'hover' about 20 meters in the sky when we realized shit just got real. No, we weren't dreaming. I said ""Alexis, NOW. "" We start booking it inside. we slip, did I cut, check yours. I check mine... in the same fucking place there lies a 8 cm cut on my thigh. We flip shit.

I apologize in advance if some of this seems clunky. I am re-telling individual accounts. 

My grandmother loved all of her family

Unfortunately, us ladies were almost beside ourselves. 

Not so very long after she died

**Martha(aunt):** Martha had the worst flu of her life. She was in bed with a fever that flirted dangerous levels, and how she didn't know if she could manage without her. She cried herself to sleep. 

A while later, she saw my grandmother. Behind her were men that looked to be darker-skinned (she couldn't tell what ethnicity they were). My grandmother smiled at her, and my aunt said it was like she heard her voice inside of her head. ""Let me go, darlin'. My daughter is strong. She will always find a way."" My aunt said she felt warm, like someone had put a blanket fresh out of the dryer on her. My grandmother disappeared after that. No glimmer, no fading, just gone.  
____________________


**Helen(cousin):** Helen is a person who is open to all sorts of experiences and possibilities, but was not far enough along to even have the slightest of belly yet. When the psychic began to speak to her, Helen said she looked at her in a very odd way. She then said, ""Your grandmother misses you so much. Your baby is a girl, you know this yet? It is your grandmother... her soul. She's coming to watch over you and keep you safe."" This woman did not know that our grandmother was dead, or that Helen had a particularly close bond with her. Not to mention that she was pregnant with a child that turned out to be a girl. When her daughter got older, she looked more and more like our grandmother
___________________


**Me:** I had two experiences with my grandmother. She and I had been very close. My mom worked full-time, and it was my first experience with death. It absolutely devastated me, and I had no idea how to cope with such a thing. I was suffering from horrible nightmares (an egg timer set for 30 minutes, a variety of medications in front of me- find the right combination and I save grandma. Fail, and she dies. Every time, I failed. Every time, right before the timer went off, ""Why didn't you save me?"" The timer would buzz


I was in the hospital. I was violently ill, but I could hear everyone talking. I could hear my mother muttering to my step-father about how my father was a bastard for not coming to the hospital. I could hear the doctor talking to them. Suddenly, a cool, soft hand was put on my forehead. I felt soothed and at ease instantly. A voice that sounded familiar said, ""Shhh, you rest now. You're going to be better so soon, little flower. "" The hand was gone. I remember getting the sudden realization in my feverish mind that my grandmother said that to me when I was sick on her couch as a child. The voice was my grandmother's. My mother said that all though my eyes never opened, ""Come back!"" a few times until I just whimpered and then got quiet again.


The second experience was when I was reading a book one day. All of a sudden, ""Don't you remember going to my funeral? I'm dead. You've got to let me go honey. You can't fuss over me anymore."" Could it have been a dream? Possibly. However, I have no recollection of dozing off or waking up.

This is an old experience I had around the beginning of last year.  I’m cross posting both posts I put on /r/nosleep because it's a very unique experience I had and I want to share it with this subreddit.   I’ll copy paste both of them here


**Initial post**


I take night classes at a community college, I got preoccupied asking my professor some questions about the lecture and missed the last bus.  I called some people if they could give me a ride, but they were all busy, so I just decided to walk home.  I don't know the exact time, but I probably left campus around 10:30 PM.


The area is the part of the city where the suburbs meet rural areas, to minimize my walking distance.  I was talking with my cousin on my phone to keep me company, but almost an hour in the walk, my phone died.  So I just walked alone in the dark of the night and the silence of winter.


I then arrived at an abandoned farm.  Not sure why it was abandoned


About a quarter into the farmland, warming my left hand with my right.  In my head, I continually repeated,"" what the fuck?""  I continued standing for about a minute of two, getting my composure back.  I gave out a long sigh and continued walking with my hands in my pockets.  However, within seconds, I started to feel like there was someone following me from behind


Now halfway through the farm, but the presence behind me was still there.


I was now passing the farmhouse, the girl's crying ceased.  A moment of relief and complete silence.  Then out of no where, a loud shriek from the same voice came from behind.  I jumped from shock and pulled my hands out of my pocket without thinking, and at that moment, I felt the same cold feeling grasp my left hand again.  I turn around and see a small, dark silhouette standing right there.  I completely lost it, screamed in horror, and ran until I couldn't run anymore.  (I'm overweight


While catching my breath, I couldn't find it anywhere and I walked all the way back to the fence to the abandoned farm.  At this point, I fall to my knees, finding out that I probably dropped my backpack in the farm.  I absolutely didn't want to go back there at the time, so I trudged all the way home.


Late the next morning, or that dark figure did.


**Update Post**


People wanted pictures, during the day, with a friend.  I only took pictures of the house, since that's around the place where the climax of my story happened.


The album is [here](http://imgur.com/a/Bfadr#R1u6M).  (The last picture in the album is supposed to be the first.  My bad)


Sorry that I didn't show any proof


Seeing that there was evidence of people coming to the house in the past, when I was there last time.


I also recorded a video of my friend and I visiting.  I wasn't thinking of uploading it


The video took place before the pictures


The video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuS51cDkGxE).


Here's the part that I want explained.  What the heck is that crackling and rattling sound?  It progressively gets more frequent as we continue going into the house and it gets the loudest when I look at the right corner of the back room.  I filmed myself again walking around my house and watched it


As far as I know, and daughter lived on the farm and they suddenly left. They were soft-spoken and rarely conversed with their neighbors. I got this information from a person who owns another farm close to it. His father knew them, but he himself didn't. He only knew them through his father. His father passed away, so I was only able to get any info he knew. Other farm owners around the area arrived after it was abandoned.


I'm really no sure where else I can get information on the farm.


**Current update**

The last I past by the farm was last winter holiday.  The whole farm is completely gone.  The house demolished, but in the end, I can’t visit this place anymore.  On the bright side, I’m glad I took a picture of the Marilyn Monroe graffiti.  If I’m going to take anything positive out of this, it’s that.

After I came off the PC I went downstairs, kinda shook me but attributed it to me being jumpy after discussing the strange flickering, carried on, got stuff ready, then went to the toilet, as I was in there, I heard a slam from outside the bathroom, might still be me being jumpy, it was like a windstorm pointed at me, we have a ton of windchimes and stuff on our yard that would have been making a racket

It's the next morning now, posting this quickly before I get started. Nothing too strange happened this morning except a little lantern we keep over the fireplace on a chain decided to go swinging of it's own accord, I'm still trying to put that one down to me running downstairs after grabbing my key but I honestly don't know if that would've been anything close to enough to cause it. It wouldn't be the first time something has started swinging without any outside influence in my house.

I have a few ideas over what could have caused it

UPDATE: First of all, while everyone was at work, that both boxes of bottles and cans we keep on the yard ready to put out for recycling (they're damn heavy), were both at the other side of where they'd been put, upturned and with bottles all around them. We've lived here for several years, and always put them in the same place, protected from the wind, the day after. I don't think it's coincidence

When you expand that image you can see where the road curves out of view.

We had left after a late dinner. It was October or November so it had gotten dark early. I want to say this happened around 10pm. This is a desolate stretch of road, listening to music, having an overall good time. I was in the right passenger seat, looking out towards the trees as we drove by. We neared this turn, and as the suburban whipped around the corner, we all fell silent. It was suddenly very cold, and very tense.

On the right side of the road we saw this figure, in a light-colored wool blanket or something, almost like a shawl from the top of her head down to her feet, loose and raggedy looking. I remember that her right eye was visible, bright bright blue and way too wide, like she was scared. We locked eyes as we passed, and then she was gone. I looked behind me to see if she was there

It was probably the most frightening experience in my life. We all saw her. After a few moments

Remembering our reaction to it

I remember some urban legends about that road growing up

1375927514.0,1jxf2t,[ME] The scary woman in my room or How I adopted a spirit cat,cihuacoatl,38,9,6,"Hello everyone. I posted a while ago an experience I had

I lived in an old building from the 60‘s up until five years ago. The building was old

This happened about eight years ago. I had moved to a bigger bedroom because my brother moved to another city for college, some new neighbors moved to the apartment above mine. They were a family of four: mom, dad, too teen boys.

They were a very violent family. Almost every single day they screamed at each other, throwing objects, pushing, and so on. It was dreadful. The police came in several times, but as usual, nothing changed.

Everyone in the building was scared they might turn up dead one morning. That’s how bad it was.

Anyway, when one night I went to bed late. I was tired, and I closed my door so my cat couldn’t come in at night and wake me up.

I really don’t know what time it was, so I developed my own system to stop the horrible episodes before they began. I still use that method, and fortunately, after years of meditation, I haven’t had an episode in at least a year.

Well, so I forced myself to wake up. It was very difficult, but I finally succeeded. It was around 2:30 AM (I constantly woke up around that time, long before I even knew that in Japan the witching hour is between 2 and 3 A.M.) To avoid falling asleep again, I turned on the lights and got up, so I could walk a bit in my bedroom. I grabbed a book, read for a while, I’d just wake up.

I went back to bed, and I assumed it was my own hair, but when I tried to grab it to move it aside, I realized it was not my hair. I must say I was not fully awake, but wasn’t asleep either. I could move, but the ringing was beginning to sound in my ears.

As I said, so there was no chance it was mine. I opened my eyes. There was nothing. I was too scared to even try to turn on the lights, and I instinctively began praying. I looked again, and to my dismay, in the corner I (very briefly) saw a woman crouching in the ceiling (yes, she was upside down, looking at me). Her hair was long, and she wore a white gown. No, because I was sure it was not human. It had never been human. I don’t know how I knew. I just knew.

I closed my eyes, and I simply did what I knew best: cast a circle (I’m a pagan, in case you wonder). I called the elementals, I call the Gods, I begged them to help me keep that think away. The damn thing didn’t leave. I prayed harder, visualizing the bubble of golden energy around me grow bigger. I was absolutely terrified.

And then, and I felt it’s warm weight cuddle. I could almost feel the “woman” growl, angry, and she vanished, just like that.

I thought, but then I remembered I closed the door and there was no way my cat was with me. I closed my eyes tight, still terrified, but the truth is, that warm, cuddly presence was actually comforting. I finally fell asleep after a while.

Next morning

Curious thing is, I constantly saw a cat-shaped shadow in the living room. I can, sometimes, “see” how spirits look like (that’s how I know how the “woman” looked like). I know it was a black and very big cat. It liked to sit on the top of the back of the grandfather chair we had. It played with my cat, and I think my cat actually liked him very much.

The weird horrible woman never appeared again, doors opening and closing, shadow people) stopped, except for the cat. I used to thank him for his help almost every day, and left him cat food and toys sometimes. I never got a name from him, and never tried to give him one. Even my mom, the skeptic (who I think is just a witch in denial lol)

One day

I am convinced that cat was some sort of guardian that the Gods sent us to keep us protected from that inhuman horror. I have my own ideas on why it came to me as a cat, all I need to do is call.

So, too real. I still feel nervous when I remember that evil thing because I genuinelly felt in danger, and I pray to all the Gods I never encounter something like that again.

1375749538.0,1js1fx,I know there's more of you out there...,WhiskeyBones,29,2,29,"Hello all

I figured I'd write about a somewhat recent experience I've had. The title refers to both people that I'm sure have had similar experiences

I like to think there are things out there that we can't explain or prove, and I was laying down for bed (at a good time mind you, which is a change). I'm in a dead sleep when I feel like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. The adrenaline surge wakes me from my sleep, and i shoot up to a sitting position in my bed. As soon as I sit up, my eyes lock onto a particular place in my room, the right corner at the foot of my bed. There, a small floating black mist hangs in the air. I don't think I've ever felt such fear or horror before

After a few seconds, it backed out through the wall behind it.

Now I think it's fair to doubt all unconfirmed experiences unless evidence is produced. But I've never felt anything like this. This mass that was darker than the pitch black of my room, like it was glaring back at me as if it reviled me.

I've done a little bit of googling and seen that other people have had similar experiences. Has anyone here had any moments like this? Can anyone shed any insight on what this thing may be?",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1js1fx/i_know_theres_more_of_you_out_there/
1372310849.0,1h5tro,"[ME] My Grandmother's Death Seems to Have ""Called"" Me to My Deepest Meditative Experience. And What Happened There.",DeathofaMarshin,33,6,6,"I originally posted this in /r/Psychonaut

I'd like to preface this by saying that I do not have any (known) physical or mental illnesses or issues. I do not take any medications. I was not sleep deprived nor in any emotional state when this occurred. I had (and have) some residual THC in my blood, but I'm not really interested in any ""easy-way-out"" denial of my experience. I would like to know more about what exactly happened to me! And if there's something wrong with me that turns up in the future, I'll be sure to update everyone. As of now, I have NO reason to suspect that's the case. I'm really sorry about how long this is, but I tried to be as accurate and thorough as the nature of the experience would allow.

Some time, something absolutely fantastic happened. It's the kind of thing you read about and dismiss as an overly emotional relative trying to make sense of a tragedy. I assure you that this isn't the case. I'm definitely not an overly emotional person. Making up stories to attract attention to myself is not something I do. And if I decided to, I would, instead, write a novel and make it more creative. Without further ado:

So ~7:19am. I'm browsing r/psychonaut and had just read a comic (saved). The last 3 frames of the comic basically depicted ego death of a DMT user. 

I looked at the last frame, ""Heh, I've experienced that. Maybe DMT helps people experience things which I've been practicing (through meditation)."" I then looked at the final three frames again and proceeded to close the image and move on to something else. However, before I could click, I felt a tingling chill rush up my body.

It was a kind of feeling that I'm familiar with. It happens when I'm preparing to meditate and slowly work my way from each of my toes up to my head using my focus to relax each part as I pass. It's a pretty standard TM/Hatha technique and it usually takes about 10 minutes of stern concentration and undivided focus.

This time... this time it happened in about 4 seconds. I was lying on my bed with my body perpendicular to my monitor. My head was elevated by my left elbow so that I was looking, with the keyboard directly under my outstretched left fore-arm. It's exactly how I'm lying now, as I type this. I felt it start at my toes and rush up through my legs and pelvis, then into my chest - 4 seconds.

Anyway, very faintly, of a certain sensation I feel in my forehead when in deep, relaxed meditation. I suppose I might describe it as ""butterfly kisses"" on the center of my forehead. I believe it's what some would consider to be the ""Third-Eye Chakra activation"". So, while I don't fully subscribe to the Eastern/New Age notions of the Chakras, I just assumed that this was something related to what they consider to be the ""Heart Chakra"". I thought, for some reason

This chest sensation I was experiencing WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE ""BUTTERFLY KISSES""! Regardless, I lay down, eyes never opening, and began to chant and control my breathing:  ""Oiiiiihhhhhhhhhhhmmmmnnnnn"".

From the time ""the tingle"" started

Now, jaws, scalp, etc...) and focus on the one point that was acting strangely, my chest. The very top of my pectorals was contracted tightly, pulling my shoulders into my chest and spreading my shoulder blades apart. It wasn't strenuous or painful. I could ""fight it"" in the same sense that you can fight vomiting. I could pull my shoulders outward without great effort, but when I relaxed again, very strange. 

The weirdest part was that I could concentrate on it and analyze what was going on with that part of my body. Normally, fully. It was relaxed... it just had a new ""relaxed"" state.

Eventually, it wasn't anything that seemed to be a threat to me or that I couldn't completely interrupt by pulling myself out of meditation and brushing it off. It felt very... voluntary. Once I had rationalized this idea, I felt even more relaxed and ready to find out what this ""call to meditation"" was all about.

This was the first time I got the message: ""Grandma; Your grandmother"".

My grandmother, via dermal patch, for about 3 full days. Her outlook was bleak, but there was a chance that she may come back for hours/days before she finally let go. So, you can imagine how I might immediately reject that ""my grandmother"" had something to do with this physical phenomenon that I was experiencing. I didn't want to hear that. I dismissed it as ""something that was fresh in my mind, weighing me down."" I decided to move into a deeper state of meditation, and to forget this ""grandma"" business.

The technique I use to move deeper is similar to the ""body part focus"", beliefs, worries, cares... fear really stood out to me. I still thought that I had ""triggered"" some kind of ""heart chakra activation"" and that I may end up experiencing something on a completely new level. Little did I know! So, after I had swallowed my fear by thinking ""this is what you are seeking, just go to this level with no expectations."", I disacknowledged my physical form. I thought, let my body take care of my body. It doesn't need my consciousness to exist."" You know

About 8-10 minutes have past at this point. I lost focus (because of my body) at some point

My mind was completely quiet now! So quiet. I began to feel like the tightness in my chest was being caused by an outward force: someone or something else. It felt like it was... opening me? Drawing something from me? I can't really explain it in a useful way. I decided that I would not only let it do what it was doing

""Grandma; It's you grandmother. Your grandmother is here."" This time, maybe I can talk to her. I visualized the idea that my grandmother is someone I would give open access to my energy. I could be honest with my grandmother. I don't have anything to hide from my grandmother. I wanted to connect to my grandmother.

So, are you here?""

""XXXX

I'm crying writing this - and it's not sadness. It's... fear of me acknowledging it all over again.

""Yes it's me

I was in quite a bit of doubt.

""Oh

""You won't die alone, ""I'm with you in spirit.""

She Laughed. Then

""I knew I was dying... and, and it's beautiful, but I felt like I was so alone. I called out to Jesus, 'Jesus save me. Help me, Jesus. I am alone and I'm scared.' And then I saw that one light was brighter and stronger than all of the others. I knew that this shining star had to be Jesus. So, I came closer to it; but, that's where I found you.""

Being young I felt very worried because I was looking at someone in my childhood house that i had never seen before. I covered myself with my bed cover to try to remove the sight. around 10 minutes later I uncovered my head to the same sight

Weeks passed and i was still bothered. I had asked my brother if he had lent a boy one of his shirts and he wasn't sure what i was talking about. I was convinced that it was all my imagination until i got the urge to talk with my sister.

Like what would I say? I knew my mom would think I'm weird and so would my friends. I started to imagine that this ""shadow man"" was like a guardian for me and I almost felt more secure with its passing.   
  
   Over the weekend I had my friends over. We were up in my room and I was standing by my tv putting in a movie and they were sitting behind me on my couch. And there goes my shadow man again. I turn, like they seen a ghost! And my one friend says ""uuh, your house is haunted!""  I said "" you saw that too?!""

As I was playing I couldn't really shake the feeling that something was off. Since I was really doing shitty in my game I disconnected and browsed MySpace for a bit. I couldn't stop thinking about my mom's weird behavior. Why hadn't I heard her come downstairs from her room? And why hadn't she answered me at all when I spoke to her? Finally

Now my mother is heavy footed and on top of that my 7 pound dog makes the stairs creak when he slinks his way upstairs. So nothing made sense. I quickly started becoming really creeped out the more I thought of it. I stayed up all through the night watching T.V. with the lights on and waited until the sun came up to finally zonk out on the couch. When my mom came downstairs she woke me up and asked me why I was sleeping down there. I told her I couldn't get to sleep. I then immediately asked her if she had come downstairs in the middle of the night to get a drink of water or something. Seeing that I was uneasy she slowly replied that she had not. She then continued to ask ""What did you see last night?"" I then told her what had happened and she assured me that from what I had told her she didn't think whatever I saw was threatening but did agree that it was creepy. Just in case

I made my way back over to the sink to find the knob had been turned almost all the way off.

I figured that maybe one of my coworkers had seen the water running and turned if off so I wouldn't forget it and it wouldn't overflow. I didn't pay much attention to it. This happened a few days later

Then one day I turned on the water to fill up the sinks as usual while my coworker was taking pizza out of the oven. Keep in mind that this entire time she was taking pizzas out of the oven.

1362727921.0,19wgjb,{ME} My family's experience in our 100 year old house (was recommended here by commenter on my post in r/paranormal),zomystro,34,6,13,"The house that I grew up in as a kid had been bought by my Dad from his Mom. He also lived there as a kid and wanted to keep it in the family when my Grandma decided to sell it. I moved there when I was very young and shared a room with my brother. When I got a little older my parents decided I needed my own space and turned what was - at the time - being used as storage

Anyway once i moved in I started noticing strange things happening in the evenings. The most prominent thing happened when I was about 7 years old. I was asleep and I woke up to my blankets hovering over the bed, like objects being moved around and things like that.

A few years later we were discussing that event at a family gathering and I started to hear stories from other family members who had also stayed in that room who had never shared their experiences before now. My grandma would have been the first in the family to experience anything. She said that more than once she woke up to the feeling of someone sitting on the bed beside her. One of those times it was right on her feet and lower legs.

When my Dad was a kid it was his room for a while. Since it was a really old the window moldings had warped and couldn't be opened and therefore been nailed shut to prevent rattling. My dad says on numerous occasions he would wake up to the curtains ""blowing in the wind"" and when he would get up to check the window - it was obviously closed. He also woke up one night to the closet banging against the wall (same as mine).
Once my dad became a little older he moved into a bigger room and his younger brother stayed in there. My dad is quite a bit older than his little brother and he and my mom (who were dating at this point) were babysitting him. Only the 3 of them were at home. He heard his brother screaming from upstairs and he ran up to see what had happened. He had seen a hand come around the door and then it slammed shut.
My dads sister claims that she rolled over while she was in bed and saw someone walk out of her room

I don't know of the history of the house or anything about the previous owners but everyone seemed to be sick all the time and we didnt notice it until we moved and realized that no one had had a cold in a few months. Men seemed to have really bad luck in that house. My grandmas 2nd husband died there right after I was born

1361290214.0,18tna4,Native American Ghost,TlMB0,34,6,10,"First off

My experiences with this Native American spirit began a few years ago. Every summer I used to go to spend a week or so at my aunt's house in Montana. 3 summers ago I am spending the night there, the laundry room, and a bathroom. Around 1 a.m. I get up because I need to go to the bathroom. As I turn to the hallway I see a slightly translucent, but full figured Native American Indian walking down the hall, then through the wall leading into laundry room. The entire sighting lasted maybe 2 seconds tops. (Sorry that I can't give a more detailed explanation of what he looked like, I was tired and it was a very quick experience. I could tell based on what I did see that he was a Native American based off of his attire and hair.) I didn't feel threatened by the presence, and frankly wasn't even entirely sure that it happened

The next morning

Me: ""Hey Aunt Debbie... have you ever seen anything... weird in the downstairs hallway?""
Her: ""Why
Me: ""I'm not sure. Maybe.""
Her: ""Did you see.. a Native American man?""

When she said that

Me: ""Yeah...""
Her: ""I've seen him.""

That was as far as the conversation went. I confirmed this also with one of my cousins

My aunt had just recently gotten a job here in Washington and had to leave her house in Montana. My uncle and cousin (her husband and daughter) stayed behind in Montana to sell the house, whenever I would have a few days free I would stay at my grandpa's house as well, bunking on a couch in the family room.

Now late one night, but do you know the feeling when you are literally right about to fall asleep, and then something happens happens the instantly snaps you awake for really no reason at all? Well I could tell I was seconds away from being out like a light when I heard a voice. It sounded like it was a mixture between in my head, and in the room, but still I could hear it clear as day. It said ""Is he asleep yet?"" It was a voice I hadn't ever heard before and an accent that I couldn't quite pick out. 

Needless to say I was now fully awake and looking around the room

It was about 3:45 a.m. and I was awake, the table, a small section of the wall behind it, everything. It looked like a shadow, as if someone where standing behind me, in between me and the lights on the ceiling. The looming shadow was accompanied by the sensation that I was not alone in the room. Upon seeing the shadow darken my little gaming corner, I turn my head around expecting to see my grandpa (he usually wakes up around 3:30-4:00ish), as was the feeling. Again

Fast forward 3 days. Yet again, and in the opposite side of the bathroom is the room my aunt has been staying in. I walk towards the bathroom and as I walk past my aunt's door I see the handle twist and the door swing open. I assume it was my aunt getting up to get ready for work so I just say ""Oh hey"" and continue towards the bathroom. 

After relieving myself (couldn't have been more than 35 seconds total) I leave the bathroom and happen to look into my aunt's room and see her still sleeping soundly in bed. I instantly get a bit spooked out and hurry back to my place in the family room. My grandpa wakes up probably about 20 minutes later and I hear him wake up my aunt and ask her if she knew her door was wide open. I didn't hear anything after than and I was really curious

Me: ""Hey did Aunt Debbie not know her door was open?""
Him: ""No
Me: ""That's weird
Him: ""It was probably the furnace kicking in. The door must not have been closed all the way and the shifting air pushed it open""
Me: ""Yeah

I didn't tell him that I very clearly saw the handle turn. Unless the furnace recently started pumping out air at hurricane speeds

I tell this all to one of my cousins, I can post some of them later if anyone is interested). I figured this could be possible, but it didn't explain the male voice that snapped me awake that first night. Eventually we both decided that we just didn't have any idea what was happening, so there was nothing really that could be done.

Fast forward one last time to last night, now you don't have to deal with that Indian ghost""

Her reply brought everything that had been happening recently together. She said ""I wouldn't be so sure of that. He has been following my mom since our old house in Richland (where they lived before Montana)."" I told her about everything I had experienced over the past weeks

I don't know why this spirit has taken such and interest in my aunt (enough to follow her around for over 12 years so far), he would have done something by now. Even still it is a bit discomforting to know that I am sharing this house right now with this spirit. I don't feel threatened or anything, but I think for my own sanity I will be heading back to my own house and staying there until my aunt finds herself a new house. 

Again, I feel like if I told this all to anyone else they would think I am crazy. So thanks to any of you who made it through this whole thing. 

If I have any future encounters with the Native American spirit I will update this,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,t3_18tna4

PLEASE RESPECT MY WISHES!!! People at /r/nosleep were absolute jerks about this and thought I was adding this for dramatic effect

I am sharing this story because I feel it was an important event in my life and feel that that it is worth sharing

Enough, dave, ""richie"" rich (his parents gave him a bunch of money all the time), and we were smokin some herb at erics house. eric gets a call from this girl brandi who he had been trying to smash. richie rich knew her but dave and i did not. I know this as true because dave had just moved into the st louis area from oklahoma a month or so prior (we became friends at school because he smelled weed on me), and only had met eric twice at that point.

ANYWAY, and that sounded like fun. We all hop into my car and head over there, and we are just chillin upstairs talking and having a good time and what not, when i ask eric to ask brandi (socially awkward penguin that i am) if its cool that we play pool. she says sure, so we are heading downstairs. brandi is in front, then eric, then dave, and then richie rich

brandi makes it all the way down, and like freezes up.. me and richie are stuck behind him, i try to give him a nudge but before i do, he says, and I quote ""What the FUCK, why did you bring me here???"" brandi turns around, and is like offended or something, remember?) eric goes ""What??"" a mixture of confused and offended for brandi. Dave points to the middle of the room and says ""WHO THE FUCK IS THAT?"" eric and brandi turn around and im also trying to peek my head around and see who he is talking about. eric says who??? What??? brandi has a very confused look on her face. dave says ""WHO IS THAT

Dave says ""No man fuck you guys im out"" And like pushes me out of the way and richie just moves to the side. eric suddenly has this look of realization but still sort of confused look on his face, and I come back. Dave says not a word to me for the whole ride, 15 min or so, when i drop him off, im like ""See ya around, man..."" He looks at me angrily and says ""Yeah, whatever"" and slams my door as he leaves.

So I go back to brandi's place (as I cant just leave my friends there) and i come back in. eric is like come here man and we both go out on her back porch. He explains to me, from the rafters. He doesnt understand how dave knew this because brandi doesnt know dave, and dave is a nice guy and wouldnt mess with somoene who's sibling died, especially who killed themselves... Also, he happened to point at the exact spot he hung himself, according to brandi.

The only explanation we came up with is somehow he saw the ghost of her brother, and dave wouldnt have known this either.

Brandi was a fucking wreck and had just started to get over her brothers death, every time i walked down those steps my skin CRAWLED thinking about this moment.

So yep, but I really dont want to believe this as dave would never go for something like that. Thats the best explanation ive got, folks. I'm interested to see what other people think here at thetruthishere. Ive never been able to think of any ""rational"" explanations, and will answer any questions to my best ability.

Plagued by a Demon

It started with an Ouija Board, being 8 year old's and having fun scaring the crap out of each other. Suddenly we both felt a chill run down our spines at the same time. We freaked for a moment, then decided it was nothing. We played some video games and then passed out around 11.

Now, she woke up at 3 or so in the morning, to witness me, sitting facing the wall, rocking back and forth silently. She tried calling out to me softly, no answer. She walked over and said my name again, right next to me. I just kept rocking with no response. Finally, told her I was sleepwalking and then just simply crawled back into bed. The next morning

Soon after, or tune off entirely. I'd come back to things being moved in my room with no one else home, I would see random shadows out of the corners of my eyes, etc etc. I tried telling my parents but they brushed it off as morbid imagination (to be fair, I was one of those weird girls who read stuff like Stephen King - yes even at 8, I was an awesome reader - but I'm rambling, so I digress).

We soon moved into an old house, and I was blamed for it, my persistent denials meaning noting to them. Every opportunity I used to try to tell them the house was haunted was met with scorn at best, and anger at worst. I stared having to go to therapy do deal with my 'imagination issues'.

Then, for no reason it stopped. I was on edge for weeks, waiting for something to happen. Agonizingly slow weeks, waiting for something, anything to happen. I slowly started to relax, thinking it was over. Tried to forget about it for the most part. My parents and I were getting along better, there was no more fighting

At 13, and a wheelchair for 8. That's when it started again. However, it was worse than it had ever been, strange things started happening inside the hospital while I was there, including things that went missing from other patients rooms. We had an organization that came once a week with animals for everyone to pet, but none of them would come near me. (I was rather distraught by that btw... fucking love animals) Luckily, this time

When I was able to go home again

Mum and I left my step dad around the time I turned 16, it was me.)

Then I turned 20. It was like a switch flipped, it once actively prevented us from leaving the house by giving me a panic attack every time I got within 5 feet of the front door. We tried getting rid of it, with mild success, but it only lasted a couple of months before it was back, and watching. I started waking up every day at 4 am, no matter when I had gone to bed, wide awake unable to get back to sleep. I felt it leering at me wherever I went, I know it felt my fear.

Finally it got to be too much, what could go wrong? Shortly after, I started being unable to eat, and throwing up anything I did manage to keep in my stomach, to the point where I had to be hospitalized on three separate occasions in a span of a month and a half, hooked up to IV's and given meds to calm me down. After weeks of agony and anxiety I put my foot down, no more communicating

My boyfriend and I set up in the kitchen, incense and candles. He handed me the box of salt, and I tried to put it down next to me, he shook his head and pressed it into my arms, telling me to hold on to it. Immediately after I did so I stared vomiting again, uncontrollably into a bucket I had handy, never letting go of the salt. Finally it subsided enough that we could concentrate on getting rid of whatever it was. He took my hand, I started to feel an excruciating pain just underneath my rib cage, and the bathroom door slammed down the hall, from inside the house. We could feel it outside

It's more or less gone now, I just have to be strong enough not to let it.

Throughout my entire life, but this 'intuition' never fails to shock me at it's accuracy and consistency.


  A prime example was when I was in my freshman year of high school. There was a man at my school, and my 14 year old self never quite had the confidence to tell me to leave me alone despite how unnerved I always felt around him.


  I lived in the country, who worked at a different school, would come pick me up to take me home. The walk took about 40 minutes.


This man, and I'd walk by on the other side of the street). One day, he ran after me. I stopped and asked him what was up. He asked if he could walk me home. I felt uncomfortable, and did not want to tell him that it was only my grandparent's house. I merely said sure, and we walked.


  He openly flirted with me for most of the walk, that led to the street that went to my grandparents. He grabbed me, and pressed me up against the railing of the bridge, suddenly intense. He told me, very fiercely, that he would make me want him. I was afraid, I had no idea what to do.


  Suddenly, and bolted. My mom, who didn't have a car, had gotten my grandma or grandpa (I can't remember which) to drive her in from the country, because she said she had a really bad feeling and felt like she needed to find me. She said the feeling got so intense that she left my grandparents to start walking to find me (I usually took the same way there every day).


  Needless to say, and always made sure I had a friend with me at school. He left me alone a few months later.


  There's been other times as well (for me, this would become quite long to read! I wouldn't want to bore anyone :P

First of all let me just say that nothing over the top or scary has happened to me. These experiences are just noteworthy and strange.

The first one happened when I was 15. My friend and I were hanging out in her living room, while the other stood next to him/her/it. I whispered to my friend, very slowly and warily ""Do you see what I'm seeing?"" and in the same manner she said ""Uh-huh"". Shortly after this the figures just vanished. The whole encounter lasted about a minute or so.

The second incident was when I was in my early 20s. My husband and I decided to take a walk around 4 am. It started raining so we sat under an awning type of thing in an empty parking lot (one of those things you park your car under). We were quietly talking when out of nowhere, maybe even millions of dragonflies in my life and *this* was no dragonfly. Or an insect at all, for that matter. We both froze, just looking at this thing hovering maybe 3 ft ahead of us. It was under the rain, and didn't seem to be affected by it one bit. I kept searching for a body but it had none! Imagine nothing but a pair of wings flying in front of you. I didn't know what to make of it. My husband eventually said ""What... IS that?"" and I said I had no idea. But by the way it kept hovering in front of us suggested that it was intently checking us out. Then it calmly flew away into the woods ahead... We've NEVER seen anything like it since.

This is a true story, I'm not sure which, and in my town's graveyard. Now I live in a town called Milton, Massachusetts. It's pretty old, as far as old in America goes (around 1640), and you may have heard of it, money.com/money magazine voted it #2 town in the States in 2011. It's pretty nice place, but hell to grow up in as a kid as there is absolutely nothing to do here.

Our cemetary is just as old, covering a dozen or so acres, with rolling hills and a duck pond. I'm very used to it. As kids my friends and I used to play Man Hunt there at night, and I did a research project on it during college. There are several famous people buried there, including Howard Johnson (of the resturaunt fame); George Hollingworth, a semi-famous American painter; and numerous Free Masons, including a 32nd degree mason (33rd degree is as high as you can get). Anyway
I was hanging out with my friend Chris one night drinking some mead he had home brewed. We got bored of the usual videogames/music/TV and decided to wander around town, no matter which cemetery it is (though I'm sure the fact that we were both very familiar with our one helped a bit). We ended up in the old section of the place, which runs along a well lit and oft used road. It was probably around midnight, give or take 30 minutes.

There's a part of this section which contains old crypts from the 1800's. They have granite frames set into the earth at a roughly 35-40 degree angle, whimsically entertaining the idea. Wouldn't it be grand? Of course there were cars passing every so often and the situation was already a little sketchy – I was certaintly nervous. He really seemed to want to do it though, so to placate him I took a look at the various doors to see which ones would be most easily hacked into, on the premise that we would come back another time (though of course we wouldn't). Well, in looking at these I came across something I hadn't noticed before during my various tours of the cemetery. At the corner of one of the crypt doors was a sizeable chunk of rock that had come out, and by using your flashlight you could see into the interior. I took a look in, giving it a cursurary view, but you really couldn't see into it because of the angle of the stone. I judged there to be about 3 feet of space between the floor and the ceiling, on alert

He's mumbling about how cool it is, and possibly making thermite to get in. All of a sudden he stops dead and quickly drops onto his stomach to get a better vantige point into the cemetery.
“Hey, really, I see something in the left hand corner where the stairs empty out into the chamber. Here take a look.” He hands me back the flashlight and I hold the beam of light against my chest to douse it while giving another look around the street for cars, then I drop down onto my stomach as he had, fix the light into the hole and peer in.

Sure enough, was a gleaming white dome. A skull. I don't know how I missed it when I first peered into the crypt, I guess it was nerves, but I saw it now, clear as day. I let out an awed, excited murmur and tried to leverage the flashlight and my body so I could get a clearer look deeper into the crypt, hoping the see the rest of a skeleton. Hoping to see something to send those all-coveted-shivers which I love down my spine.

I got what I wanted, that's what I tell myself at least, but I can tell you this in all honesty: it was pale, it moved awkwardly on four legs, it didn't appear to have fur and it was the size of a midsized dog. My heart froze and time with it, like the universe slammed on the breaks of the cosmic bus. This experience was WAY beyond my creepy comfort level. For a minute I panicked, then just like that * snap * time was back to normal. I sat up on my knees bolt upright, and I didn't care. I just walked away and he was forced to follow me asking me all the way back to his place what I had seen. I didn't tell him about it until we were well away from any woods and in the well lit streets. He was silent

I hoped in my car and went home soon after. As I lay in my bed I got to thinking (no I didn't think that whatever “it” was was after me
Some time has passed since then, which isn't hard considering the nearest road is 60 feet away. And I absolutely avoid it at night, unless I'm with at least 5 other people.

I'm Vietnamese, it's an asian ghost story, yet nonetheless true. I was born in Vietnam and lived in a house that is known to be haunted. We moved to the US when I was about three or so, but I remember every single night for dinner, my father would light up a joss stick and we would sit and wait until the joss stick had burned down to its nub. I later found out it was to pay ""respect"" to the spirits living with us and can be quite common in the Vietnamese and Chinese culture. By waiting, it means we are waiting for them to ""eat"" first, then we were allowed to eat after the joss stick has burned down. 

Anyway, bedroom, diner, all in one. There is a small square cut out that attics normally have, and there's a wooden ladder. Right underneath that space behind the ladder was my parent's bed. I'm not good at math, or I'd give you an example in square feet.

This is before I was born and my mother told me this as it was her experience. She was sick, we were too poor to have AC. In fact, many businesses didn't have AC at that time. Anyway, when she opened her eyes, she saw a pair of red shoes and part of a red traditional Vietnamese dress flowing as if someone was sitting on the edge of the attic's opening, kicking their legs ""like a little child would"". There was no body. Just the shoes and dress. She was aware of her being sick and perhaps hallucinating things so she turned around and went back to bed. About what seems an hour or so, she felt that stagnant air became really ice cold. So she rolled around to grab her blanket. What she saw was the red dress and the shoes again, ""If you didn't do anything wrong, the spirit was gone. 

Some key details I want to point out for you guys. In the Vietnamese and Chinese culture, and she was wide awake during the second appearance.

1336860452.0,tk64l,[ME]The reason I became involved with paranormal investigations.,mydarkesthour24,34,8,12,"I would like to start off by saying that I am in no way a writer

I grew up in NYC (now live in Southern California), it was about 1995/96. The church we attended was putting together a trip for the children to attend a two week long summer camp in Pennsylvania at a Christian campsite.  Our church had been doing this for awhile, and I had attended the last couple summers so I knew it would be a fun time. The name of the camp is Mont Lawn Camp, here is the website http://www.montlawncamps.org/Mont_Lawn_Retreats/Home.html

Now fast forward about halfway through the trip, and he started yelling obscenities and throwing his fists at me. A nearby counselor noticed what was going on and grabs the kids from behind and lifts him up. The counselor could barely keep a hold of the kid due to this unnatural amount of strength that he somehow obtained. Eventually, the counselor finally pins the kid down to the ground, puts one hand on the kids head, and prays. He continues praying as another counselor runs up and helps in holding down this kid as he continues trying to fight. Little by little, the kid calms; and it was at this moment that I witnessed something that would make me question the boundaries of this world.  I saw a being lift up out of this kid, and sprint off into the darkness of the woods behind the chapel. The oddest thing about what it was, and looked like it was completely covered in boils.  If this thing was a real human, but nobody even flinched. 

I always thought that I would be afraid of this sort of thing, when I approached the counselor who had pinned the kid down and prayed and explained what I saw. He just gave me some kind words and left me on my way.

They had dirt roads and mule carts even up until the 60's just as a frame of reference. Anyhow, almost deathly ill.  She was essentially a newborn by the way, within her first months.

One day

I don't really have a translation for this, but people often rushed to pick their clothing from the clothesline before the funeral because they didn't want to catch the 'air of the dead' so to speak.

Anyhow, parents, cousins.  You're probably a distant cousin of their's in the first place, as I still have countless 3rd and 4th cousins in that small town.  So she went and carried on fine until she had her daughter and shortly after birth R had noticed M getting ill.

So she went to that market and the old woman told her she caught the air.  She pulled her to the side and gave her a little prayer written down on a sheet of paper and told her to pray at a certain part of the cemetery at noon.  I'm not sure if it was a particular person's gravestone

R asked her who she was and where she lived so after she did the ritual if it worked she'd go out of her way to visit her and thank her in person again.  The lady gave her the location of her house and they parted ways.

At midnight R did as she was instructed and prayed at the cemetery reciting the prayer she had been handed.  Within a few days, but she knew the hair was the same color and length of the deceased, months after the funeral before M was even born.

She had started showing signs of getting better even before expelling the hair

R then went over to the neighboring town and looked for the house.  She followed the directions she was told to get to the house (remember most places don't have a nice and neat grid system like America you go by landmarks and relative directions).  She ended up exactly where she was told and sure enough there was a little stone house there

She asked the neighbors of the house and they looked at her a bit funny asking her if she was joking.  She explained the situation and about the old lady that had approached her at the market and solved her problem for her.  She just wanted to give thanks and pay her respects to the woman for having helped her out.

They told her there was an old lady exactly as she had described that had lived in that house up until about a year or so before when she died.  R had seen her just days earlier in the market when she was approached by her and helped out entirely.

She was honestly convinced (and I can't fault her for this) that the lady was an angel that had gone down to help her in her time of need.  It was a rough post-civil war time as I said

Basically there are 4 reasons: 1) Once you share your story

In order to get valuable feedback

But we learned something: it's not our name that holds us back. If we limit the TheTruth to just personal encounter posts then we will fail as a subreddit pretty quickly. This is obviously not what we want
------

**If you'll notice to the right, but also participate and post things relating to encounters without actually having an experience of their own. 

And of course, not just personal encounters. The tag system is VERY important because of course, [ME] will hold more weight than [FoF], but interesting none-the-less. 

Double tagging is totally fine if you are not sure where it goes, so that's not the only type of discussions we hope to see. 

As for the departure from personal encounters
------
Here's a great example of what we hope to see

His post encouraged Otahak to ask [""Numbers Stations: What do we know?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kv0ue/numbers_stations_what_do_we_know/). This post would be tagged [DIS].

Our original idea for this sub would've discouraged both of these types

We've decided to be more relaxed with what the rules shall entail. Shittycontributor has made an example post: [After reading the 'Numbers Station' thread I was reminded of this post on /creepy a while ago. It's one of the strangest stories I've read on Reddit. [FoF]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw1mi/after_reading_the_numbers_station_thread_i_was/). This will now be allowed

Another example is Shittycontributor's [The Pilliga [DIS]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw4qp/the_pilliga_dis/). Note how all the information needed to discuss is located within the text. He offers links, and why he believes it to be true, or worthy of a discussion. [LEG] was introduced after this post, but this would be a good one to tag [LEG/DIS]. This prompted Flatteblack to post [The Pilliga [FAM]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/kw86z/the_pilliga_fam/). With the tag system, you can read a discussion and post an encounter related to it, and people interested can easily find them and read.

If the community starts to stagnate again

Thanks for helping us get to 600+ members in 2 months! I'm excited to see how this develops

TL;DR: As long as the content of your post falls under the ethos we have already established here at TheTruth then it is welcome, or something widely regarded as believable. WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE FAN FICTION or CREATIVE WRITING!

She was in the kitchen cooking and I was in the living room lying on my back on the three-seat sofa staring at the wall. 


I remember feeling so comfortable, I know how this sounds so excuse me for sounding like an idiot but I really wish that I could prove this to everyone and just let the world know that this is what I saw, heard and felt.


I remember I had the understanding of not being alone in the room, like an out-of-body experience but I wasn't at my normal height, I was higher and I'm looking at myself on the couch and I can remember looking at my feet b/c I was moving them side to side and my stomach was breathing in and out and my eyes were open. 


Again I remember having a feeling of 'I don't give a shit' like it didn't effect me. Then within seconds I started to realize that I shouldn't be at this height and I felt something move within me (the out-of-body me) and that's when I knew I had either A) taken over the view of the person who was in the room with me unknowingly or B) That person did it on purpose to show me myself and show the view they had of me. I somehow knew that this person was male, fair skin, was wearing a purple suit with a black shirt, was fairly tall and his name was Jack.


It's like a switch was turned on b/c before I knew it the next second I felt a 'thrill' go through my body (the-body-that-was-on-the-sofa-me) and I was no more viewing myself from behind. I remember my body going stiff and being too afraid to get up and run for my mom or look behind me and see this purple suit guy. But the last thing that happened is till this day the craziest and oddly satisfying thing I think of when it comes to this person, getting warm and all of sudden I hear a male voice say ""How did you like that?"". The question was so audible that I could feel the breath of that voice on my ear and the tingling sensation from it. 


In a mixture of excitement


Maybe it was a dream and maybe it wasn't


I think I have to go to a hypnosis to determine the cause of this shit.

So my Dad was about 12 and my auntie was about 5
All of a sudden there was a humming through the entire house and no one could move
After this the humming stopped and everything was fine and they went to check each other. The next day the next door neighbour came out and said there was an orange disc floating above the house for about 12 minutes and then it just shot off impossibly quick.

The reason we think my dad was abducted is because ever since then he's had a little bump in his finger and he's literally cut it out and it just grows back. 
But here's the kicker. My dad and auntie were talking about the whole ordeal about 20 years later and my grandma said she came into my dad's room to find him in the corner and not in his bed. My dad couldn't believe it he thought he was in bed. Anyway I've heard that when they abduct you they wipe your memory and put you back in the wrong place because they are trying to get away quick.
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard the story from all 3 of them. Yeah freaky stuff. 

We think they follow us anyway because my dad has had similar stuff happen to him. He's been at home alone when he was about 18-19 and all of a sudden the lights went off and he said things felt different and he immediatley started whimpering like a baby. Now my dad was a football hooligan
He went to the light switch and said he felt something touch his shoulder and gently push him to the floor and he could do nothing
I've had a similar experience recently, like blacky grey skin. And my laptop just kinda floated off my lap towards the floor. The fear i felt while I was being forced down to my bed was horrible. My brain was tingling and I couldn't do anything. It was completeley bizzare.

 I'll preface first by saying this house has ghosts. We had an investigation team come in and do their thing. At the conclusion it was determined that there were actually several spirits residing in our house, but a few remained. The previous owner of the house (several times described as looking and acting like Jeff Dunham's Walter puppet), a little boy and a woman who only observes, at one spot of the house. There were also several open portals that were closed. Since then, everything has been quiet. But enough with the back story, on to the meat and potatoes.

The past couple of days, the (muffled) sounds of a party on the main floor from the floor above, as well as a general feeling of uneasiness in the basement. One night while laying in bed I was talking with my wife, and I felt a breeze. Shortly after the dream catcher we had hung a few weeks ago spun. Not violently, but enough to make me check all the windows. We have three windows in our room, and they are energy efficient windows that our landlord put in 2 or so years ago. They are a dream and reduced our heating bill by quite a bit, and are not drafty at all compared to the old windows we had. All three windows were shut and locked tight. In addition to cold spots and lighter breezes I've felt the few nights before

This next part I just found out about an hour or so ago over the phone, one roomie (We'll call her Jill) is the last one up for the night with her boyfriend (Jack). They are hanging out in her room when Jack heads to the kitchen to retrieve a salad he had made earlier. He comes back up and he sees what he thinks is my wife standing in the doorway to our room in a long white dress. I don't remember if he says anything or not, but he just heads to his room. He begins to tell Jill about that and he is about to open the door and show her, but she is very frightened by it. He goes up to the door to open it, but stops and says ""No"" and sits back down. He then begins to laugh and talk about that spirit, as well as two others (which he didn't give names). He says he feels them and knows their movements. He says that they only want some attention and to be noticed. They don't want to hurt anyone but said explicitly they (don't know if one two or all or which one) don't like my wife. They During this he is laughing one moment, and crying the next. He starts to describe what he thinks is an older man. He never saw the face, attached to ours. At this point

The next morning she is reading her notes and describing what happened to Jack

On my way to work one day, I've seen a few random episodes at friends' houses, but otherwise have little to no interest in it. When I got to work, my first stop was the employee break room, where the television was on. Pokemon was playing, the same episode and scene I was thinking of for seemingly no reason on my way to work.

Earlier at work last night

One time in my teens, inside of a bank. Later that day, I ran into Mr. Damani coming out of a grocery store that I was on my way to in order to get penny rolls from the bank that was inside.

This kind of thing happens to me at least once a month, and other times when it's absolutely way the fuck out there obscure, and then I see or hear about the exact thing I was thinking about (the dream involving Mr. Damani).

1353822944.0,13qzrm,A few odd experiences...[me],littleblackflowers,35,9,11,"Over the years I've had a number of odd encounters. I don't know if they are necessarily ghosts.

The first was when I was 16 or so. I was asleep, came in through my bedroom window. It had been closed and locked before I went to bed (I am positive I locked it, as a few months prior I'd learned the window top would shimmy down if it wasn't locked and wasps built nests in the crack), as it was cold outside. I watched the figure, shadowy but shaped like a man, watch me for a few moments and then turn to my desk. It seemed to hear or sense something that startled it, and it knocked a china figurine I had on the desk to the floor, the window was open and the figurine was smashed on the floor.

The second is the longest story, but everything was dead. There were seven trees, five still standing, that looked as though they had never had branches. The other two had fallen and looked like they had rotted out from the inside. These were tall trees, easily four to five times my height, and looked broken off at the top although the tops were nowhere to be found. After a few minutes here I felt something overwhelmingly telling me to LEAVE. I have never felt so scared in my entire life. It felt like something was pressing in on me from all sides. I managed to let my friends know this, it was hard to speak. As we left, though, causing it to welt in red lines, like it was trying to take me out of my body. Since then

The third is less creepy. I was leaving for work one day and felt a hand on my shoulder

I believe the last one was my grandfather

1353607358.0,13mndq,[ME] A few of my experiences. ,StellaUniverse,39,12,7,"There won't be any fancy writing

1) This may be the scariest. I either had a VERY active imagination as a child

I was raised Catholic

Starting when I was about 3, and red eyes). I remember at first being too terrified to say anything and would pretend that I didn't see him, but he would talk to me and start to ""push my buttons"", like by making fun of me or my family and just not being nice...I don't remember specifics but I feel like he would tell me to do bad things. Nothing horrible like murder or kill anyone, but things like to be mean to my siblings, etc.

Most every time I would see this ""man"", growing used to his presence. I was so young...I wasn't really thinking it through much more, and my mom always told me it was my imagination. I wanted to believe her. 

Gradually I worked up my courage, I asked him who he was. He gave me a a sly grin and told me ""The devil"". Well, folks, as a 3-4 year old kid, I was genuinely terrified. Obviously I didn't want to hang with the devil. I would still call for my mom, he would still laugh and disappear, and she would still tell me it was my imagination. 

Gradually, I started to just say ""God is stronger than you and God wins in the end, so shut up"". The sick smile would be wiped off his face instantly and a look of disgust would appear. Then,  if I remember, his power to speak would stop and he would gradually disappear. 

Only one person believed me

She says we were having a sleepover, she saw his reflection in the mirror looking at her. She yelped and ran back into the room, and I said ""You saw him too??"", and then I told her everything.

I never told other friends at school because I didn't want them to think i was crazy. By the time I was about 6
When I asked my mom how many times I screamed for her to come running

2) This is an experience involving the same friend. When we were about 8,  so that they formed kind of a canopy of the inside. Sometimes I would hang out on the ""inside"" of the tree's canopy, feeling like I had my own house. Sometimes though, it just seemed way too creepy out there. I was always very in tune with nature as a child, and I remember being interested because there was a giant eagle's nest at the top of one of these trees and I always dreamed of climbing all the way to the top.

Anyway. One day, when she suddenly looked at the tree to her right and let out a scream and started running. I rolled my eyes, thinking she was being dramatic and feeling even more infuriated at her. I marched over to the tree so I could prove how stupid she was being and how there was nothing there. What I saw was the shadowy figure of a small Native American woman looking out at me in hate and anger. I was clearly not welcome there. I let out a scream involuntarily, and also started running, meeting my friend back at my house, where the front door was wide open (Had my mom left it open?). We ran up to my rom and gazed out of my blinds at the tree, speculating on what we had both saw. We agreed that we both saw an angry looking Native American woman. We both agreed that we did not think she was alive.

3) This one isn't creepy, we were about 13. We were lying on the floor at her house with our heads together, dozing off. I don't remember what, but something triggered me thinking that she had read my mind. So I started to play a game. I told her I would send her images and numbers with my mind's eye, and she should tell me if she sees anything. It went something like this..

""Ok what number do you see?"" ""57"" ""Ok now?"" ""138"", flowers blooming. It was all correct each time we ""guessed"". I felt like our half asleep state with our heads put together connected our minds on some sort of ""circuit"". I've never been able to recreate this.

4) This story occured in college with a different friend. I partied a lot in college, naive freshman I was, I was dolled up in my heels and way too much makeup. I was very drunk, dancing, and just enjoying myself as usual. These three guys showed up and they instantly gave me a bad vibe, but my drunk self wasn't very receptive to these feelings and I ignored it. I know it sounds stereotypical, but these guys were also all dressed in black. I think it was the theme for their band or something. So I carried on with my partying, and instantly killed my mood. All I could feel was severe discomfort. I talked to him briefly and excused myself

At some point in the night, I instantly sobered up. My discomfort level was a 9/10. I looked around, making sure my friends were in the car with me. They were. Phew. I felt a little safer.

As they took us home, then I would jump out at the nearest stoplight. I felt urgently as though I had no other choice. I felt so relieved when they did stop at my dorm, and clambered out of the car.

The guy who tried to talk to me earlier clearly ""liked"" me. I am not the kind of girl who would flirt with a guy if I didn't actually like him, and pushed past him. Of course I didn't want him to call me. And I never ever have kissed a guy on the cheek like that for no reason. Eww.

So I passed out

One of my best friends from the party was spending the night. It was about 2:30 am and we'd been up talking in the dark. We often did this, and thought I should mention to my friend how I felt.

""Hey you know those guys who took us home the other night?""

""yeah""

""well I got REALLY bad vibes from them.""

""yeah

""I don't mean just bad..I mean....I feel like they could rape or kill someone. Something was really off with them.""

""yeah. I kind of feel that way too. I agree. The bad thing is *Our other best friend* likes one of them...they've started dating. ""

""What? I have to tell her to stay far far away.. Something is really wrong with them.""

All of a sudden, panic. I felt it but I knew it wasn't my feelings. I wanted to cry, but it was like those feelings were speaking through me. I had no reason to cry or feel panicked. I was safe in my bed. I relayed my feelings to my friend and she stated that she felt the same way. We both felt a heavy negativity in the room.

I decided to call our other friend

We decided whatever was going on

The next morning, one thing led to another, and she felt she couldn't say no. When I heard her story, I realized that he had raped her.

1352206341.0,12q5pq,Closet,masterofwolves,33,7,18,"Okay

I'm currently writing this on my phone while hiding under the covers. Yes

I came home from work (I work 3rd shift so the only other person home is my girlfriends brother who is sleeping) and was just screwing around on my computer. Let me note first that my bedroom door was open when I got home. Didn't think too much of that because I left it cracked and one of their dogs could have easily pushed it open. Not sure if it's relevant to the experience so I decided to push it open.

Anyways I'm sitting here on my computer at about 7:15 am. I'm browsing Reddit and texting my girlfriend, I was not in the mood to see an aparition, as both my girlfriend and her brother had seen one before. However I knew I had to open the closet door. I had to find out what was going on in there. Maybe the cat had gotten inside it?

So I gather the courage and swing the closet door open and nothing is there. Nothing is out of the ordinary. Absolutely nothing was knocked over. No cat in the closet. Nothing. I immediately called my girlfriend and turned on a voice recorder to see if I could capture evps. I'm going to analyze the recorder tonight. I'm not going to do a EVP session because I'm too fucking scared right now. I just put the recorder down on the dresser to see if it could capture anything on it's own. I will analyze the recordings and edit to fix any grammar issues and add more later

*EDIT: FIXED SOME GRAMMAR

*EDIT 2/UPDATE:*
Since I work third shift I just woke up. I am going to analyze the digital recorder and see if there's anything on it. If there is I will post it on YouTube for you guys.

Okay, so I turned on some TV. I settled on Spongebob, and tried not to think about what had just happened. All of a sudden I heard what sounded like several faint (as if they were coming from outside the house) and disortorted dog barks. When I say distorted they didn't sound like a regular dog park. They made sort of a ""whap"" sound. That's the best I can describe it. I payed no attention to it and decided to just get some sleep.

Anyways, and that's why I'm here. I'll share with you some of my family's experiences and ones I had my own. It's a little long, and I'm sorry if my grammar and English aren't good, I tried my best. Also, my writing skills are not awesome, lol.


My house is really old. My grandmother was born in 1940, there were people that lived here too, so you can get an idea of its age just by that. 
My grandmother told me that her aunt, but in the kitchen if I'm not mistaken. She didn't talk about that often. I'm just mentioning these  because I do not know if it's relevant to the case but I believe it's not. Although they died here and this house being old, we never experienced anything paranormal all these years. That is, until some time ago.
As you may guess, and there was not enough space for everyone (I live here with my parents, my sister, my aunt and uncle and their four kids, and with my grandmother when she was alive. A lot of people, I know. Big family). Now we have two floors, with enough space and rooms for everyone, though.

My older cousin, so she would be up late studying. One night, she heard three knocks at her door. She thought it was her father, he went to check on her sometimes, so she went and opened the door. No one. Getting back to her seat, someone knocked again. She decided to leave the studies and go to sleep that night. Some nights after that, she was again studying at night. S said that the her study light went off, she heard the knocks again. She ignored it and left studies once again. She said that when checking time in her phone

My younger cousin,M, to sleep over. I have no idea why, but they decided to play with an Ouija board (home made) that night. C told me they weren't even thinking this was real, and were with their fingers on the glass (they used a glass instead of a pointer) without any belief it would move. One should know that it is not safe to toy with this kind of thing. The glass did not move for a while when they asked if someone was there. Some minutes later they laughed at each other, commenting at how stupid they were for believing it would move and took their hands out of the glass. When they did, C said it moved by his own and neither of them was touching it. And instead of continuing the session, my aunt claims she's been hearing someone up the stairs every now and then when it's late. And she has no idea C and M played with the Ouija board

My sister always spends a lot of time in the bathroom at night. We have no mirror, holding the mirror in front of her chest. My mother asked her if she was okay, and she then told us why she was so pale. She said that when coming out of the bathroom, she was with her eyes on the mirror looking at herself while walking and she saw something behind her. So instead of turning back, she raised the mirror so she could see what or who it was. She said there was a woman behind her. A very pale woman with red messy hair and black eyes. When she looked back there was no one there, and she went running to the room scared as hell. It didn't happen again. But recently, she was talking to a friend of hers, and the girl told her that when she was going to shower

Now, she shared her room with both me and my sister. So sometimes she would decide and have a major cleaning and some of our stuff would be missing because she'd misplace them. Now I had a small little box, hand made, under my bed with some plastic jewelry I used as a kid. Once, I went to check on it and it was open, with its cover by its side. I ignored it and put it back, thinking it could be my grandmother's doing when she was sweeping the floor and hit accidentally the box and its cover would fall. But it started happening every day and the cover was always perfectly placed on the left side of the box so I stopped believing that. I asked my grandmother if she opened it or saw someone open it, which I thought was stupid but actually gave me results. I placed the box on its usual spot, and there it was

Some months after. My grandmother had already passed away. I was in the living room watching TV alone, someone walking that slow and dragging their feet with all that laziness.
The hallway is connected to the kitchen, and right after there's my living room door. Now, to get to the kitchen there's a step. I felt a thrill over my spine when I heard that someone taking the step down and 're-dragging' their feet again very slowly. Everyone was sleeping at this time, who could it be ? My dad usually comes to check on me but he does not walk that slow. All I could think was that there was a strange inside my house. My mind was screaming ""A thief. Oh my god."" repeatedly. And instead of hiding and keeping quiet, I did the most stupid thing someone would never ever do if there was someone strange and probably dangerous in their house. I started calling for my mom. ""Mom, can you come here a sec ? Moooom !"" I figured if the thief thought I thought he was my mom, he'd think someone else was awake and be gone. But the feet kept dragging until it got to the living room's door. My heart stopped. And then again, turned off the TV and opened the living room's door
After that, I'd hear whispers that gave me chills. I could never make out what it said, but it was like someone was whispering stuff right into my ears. Whenever that happened I'd always leave the game and go somewhere else where I was not alone. Fortunately,  that has stopped.

Now, or when I go to my aunt and uncle's room (which is right above my living room), I always feel a sort of tingle on the right side of my back. It's like it's numb or something. I only feel that when I'm on the mentioned rooms. I don't know if it's paranormal, probably not, but it is a weird sensation.

And these last days, me and my sister couldn't sleep and stood up late talking, each one on their bed. Then I felt that weight over my feet again. But this time it got heavier. Heavier enough for me to stay a little alarmed. ""Hey, I think there's something on my feet and I don't know what it is."" I told my sister. She said I was being stupid and that we should really go to sleep. The weight on my feet got heavier. You know the feeling when someone's sitting slowly on your lap, and you start to feel the weight progressively heavier over your legs ? I felt that on my feet. So I tried moving my feet up to move away whatever it was. Thing is, I couldn't. It was like someone sat their butt right on my feet and I couldn't move them unless the person got up. I told my sister I had someone sittin in my feet and that I couldn't move them and for her to go call someone, but she thought I was just trying to scare her and ignored. So I only stood there completely scared, but now I just try not to move and keep telling myself not to be afraid. After all it isn't attempting to do anything

I apologize about the length of this post but it is all relevant. I will probably end up putting this into two posts.

When I was in the ninth grade I was never able to sleep for the whole night. I don’t really know why I couldn't but after sleeping for only a few hours I found that it would give me enough energy to get me through the rest of the night and the day without a problem. Back then I didn't have a TV in my room so I used to go into the living room with my dog Da Vinci where we would watch cartoons while the rest of my family slept. 

My first experience took place during my usual nightly television viewing. I had been lying down with Da Vinci when I found my attention drawn to the rocking chair across the room. I had never paid much attention to it before and I had never known where it hard came from. As I continued to stare at it I noticed that it rocked a little

After a few more seconds Da Vinci bolted it up the stairs into my room with his tail between his legs and I ran after him without a second’s hesitation. Once we were safely in my room Da Vinci was still visibly shaken and I spent the following hours trying to comfort him.

The next day I asked my dad what he knew about the rocking chair. He told me that it had been passed down from one of his relatives

A Pocong is a spirit of a person whose soul cannot leave the earthly realm.
In Islamic traditions when a person dies their body is wrapped in a shroud with the arms
It's believed that the soul of the person inhabits this world for 40 days after death before moving on and if the knot at the top of the head isn't undone the body jumps from the grave and hops around to warn people that the knot is still tied.
The spirit doesn't do anything except hop around (as it's legs are still tied) and is relatively harmless
There is also a belief that the pocong can appear from place to place. One story that was related to me had the person closing and opening his eyes
 
The 2000's was booming business for Pocong with many films and tv shows being released
The popular culture version of pocong involves it being under the control of a black magician trying to get revenge on someone who has either wronged him

**Friend of a Friend Encounter**

One story I've been told by a friend involves a friend he knew. A group of them were staying in an old dormitory due to work training. 
This friend is Balinese (who are 'known' to be very spiritually open) and one night while everyone was sleeping he woke up and needed to use the bathroom, this time closer to him. Each time he closed and opened his eyes it would be closer and closer, appearing in between the beds of the dorm. He opened his eyes one more time and it was next to the bed opposite him.
He closed them one final time and waited several minutes before deciding he really needed to use the bathroom.
Opening his eyes he saw the empty room. With a bit of relief he headed out the hall very timidly keeping an eye out for the pocong
Reaching the bathroom
Scared he screamed and shut the door. He opened it a few minutes later but it was gone.

**Kuntilanak**
*Also known as Pontianak*

Kuntilanak is the spirit of a woman who died while pregnant. As with many spirits
I've heard three different stories behind Kuntilanak, but both are similar) the differences lay in what she does.

The first tales involve her coming down and kidnapping children to feed on.
Which sounds like a tale told by mothers to children to keep them inside at night time.

The second tales are about her bewitching men and killing them by ripping open their stomachs and feasting on the insides.
Either because the man stumbled across one
A lot more graphic than the children’s stories...

The first two tales seem to share a lot in common with the Malay version of Pontianak

The third types of tales are similar to vampire stories that it is able to transform into a bird and fly
It sounds like a tale told to keep young ""innocent"" people inside away from the dangers out.

The kuntilanak is known for its laughter/cries coming from the tree it's in. If the sound is loud it means it is far away

Although not common I have heard of stories about people becoming possed by a kuntilanak spirit
In one story, who is known to have red eyes.

There is a childrens rhyme that you can sing to summon a kuntilanak if you desire.

*Protection*
It's believed that if a pregnant woman carries a nail

*Differences*
The Malay Pontianak has a hole in her back and if it is plugged up she will become a normal woman
There is a spirit in Indonesia named *sundel bolong* which translates to *prostitute with a hole in her* who is a woman who died while pregnant and gave birth from the grave

There is so much public superstition about these spirits that recently a tree said to be home to a kuntilanak was cut down. Article [here](http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/ghost-sightings-spark-scenes-of-hysteria-in-indonesian-capital/482256)

There were 3 of us altogether, and I. As we walked to the gate we could see the asylum looming in the darkness. We became filled with dread, and a kind of buzzing grim excitement began building within us. As we drew closer, past the gate, I could actually feel a sensation like the air was charged with electricity.
""Can you feel it?"" Katie asked me. ""Moon really likes it here, had some trauma in her life. Her mind is not 100%. I'd met ""Moon"" before, it was quite interesting to meet someone who is very different yet sharing the body of someone you know. I believe it is due to this weak point in her psyche which led to the events of that night. 

We cautiously walk up the gravel hill, it is a two story building. Not very big, and definitely not the main facility which was like a fortress. Wanting to explore everything, we duck inside. It is a large open room, everything made of wood. Dark inside but we could see by the moonlight streaming thru the boarded up windows and the open door. There was a pile of what looked like burned furniture strewn across the floor. There was a wooden staircase leading up to the balcony, and Katie walked over to it. She stood at the base of the stairs looking up at the top, then she so very slowly stepped up, looking up
""See what?"" I asked. 
""There was a woman in a long white dress at the top of the staircase. She waved at me to come up
I didn't know what to think of this. Chris was turning into a scaredycat, and I set up the board. I think we played with the light of my phone, just me and Katie. Chris was too frightened. 
""Is anyone here?"" I asked
""What is your name?"" I asked.
Katie then said
I looked up
""They see you...."" She spoke in taunting
At this point Chris was losing his mind and asked
I wanted to stay, and led Katie/Sarah out the door. 
As we walked down the hill Sarah/Katie said, it didn't come from this world. It was set to the tune of a child's nursery song. However the lyrics were twisted. I could only hear a few words here and there, ""play things...satans wings...."" 
I stared at her, she suddenly snapped out of it, looking around as if she didn't know where she was. I asked her if she remembered anything of what happened, she said no. Katie was back, she remembered NOTHING after setting her fingers on the planchette. We walked as fast as we could back to our cars, our faces white and hearts pounding. As the ghostly fortress shrunk from view in the rear view mirror, warmth began to creep back into my body. We were safe.

When I was a teenager, sometimes they lived with us for months, others only a few days, then they'd generally disappear with not so much as a goodbye.

One of the men was probably as oily as you could imagine. He was a short stocky man who wore a beret covered in pins and ""AIM"" buttons. He took us up to the Menominee Reservation to do a ceremony. There were tons of rules like no metal on your person and no moving from your seat, or see. Once the room is settled and things are underway, he would be tied up, wrapped in a blanket, then tied up again, the lights would be turned off, leaving us in darkness and he would begin singing.

Eventually his voice wouldn't be muffled and you could hear him moving around the pitch black room. Shuffling sounds, the hair tie gone because it had a metal bit holding it together, or you'd find something else tucked between yourself and your cushion, money or stones or something. More of the wrapping up of things, being forced to eat raw kidney (it's been more than 15 years and I can remember the taste and texture of that... gag)

Mom tells him he has to do another one closer to home

When the time comes, but I think it was an art gallery or something. We're taken down to the basement and given cushions to sit on. The beginning to this ceremony is a bit different. Less Menominee and Ojibwe, but instead lots of other tribes. Blood sacrifice happens, both women and men getting cut and offering up their blood, other gifts are placed before the man as well. He is bound, blanketed, and bound again, non-human

The creature was facing the Medicine Man. I was probably only a foot or so from where its feet were, into the deep darkness of the basement, stalking to where the man sat singing. For a bit, the outline seemed to glow in the blackness, but then it faded. There was a heavy thunk sound, the song stopped, and the lights were turned on suddenly.

The sacrifices were gone, and the trinkets. The blanket was missing a large swath from it, and the rope was gone completely. The man looked as if he had aged a few years in the hour or so he spent singing.

I can’t really remember how old I was exactly. But I know it was around there because I wasn’t at school yet. I think my little sister was born by then. She is four years younger than me so if she was then she was a baby at the time. If not then I was younger.

I used to play with some of the kids from the other floors. We’d be outside or I’d be at theirs. So if I was gone my parents would know I was nearby.

I was never allowed to be left in the house alone. My parents would always take me with them if they were going to the shops. One particular day I hid somewhere in the house – I don’t remember where – until they left to get groceries. As the door slammed I remember getting excited at this new-found liberty.

I wasn’t alone in the house long. I literally felt uncomfortable a few seconds after emerging from my hiding place. It was like the moment my parents were gone something sensed my vulnerability. I remember staring at my shadow in the corridor and finding it odd for some reason. I wasn’t afraid at this point. But I still couldn’t figure why I found it weird. Another strange feeling came over me and I lifted my arm as some kind of test. I remember watching the shadow stay put. It didn’t lift its arm with me - It wasn’t my shadow.

An overwhelming sensation came over me - that whatever was in front of me was watching me, etc.

For some reason I never told them. I never even thought to. I don’t remember ever thinking about it again after the incident. And the shadow never came back. It was almost as though it left because of my reaction. As time went on I forgot about it. It was only when reading hobertbateson’s thread about multiple shadow people that it came back to me.

1317109628.0,ksqqn,I'm part of a ghost hunting team: Here are my experiences.,darkangelle,32,5,11,"As the title states
  

I'll start with a little background on myself. I've been interested in the paranormal since early childhood. It has never scared me, I remain on my middle ground. I believe there is definitely something after we die but I cannot even fathom the reasons of it. It's enthralling and scary; it makes my adrenaline pump and I love it.  
  
  
I had a hard time finding a group
  
  
We live in Puerto Rico and this first trip was to a local Indigenous Ceremonial Park. It dates back to around 500AC, hiding.    
  

On this day, as I said, this place is eerie during the day but it's spacious and beautiful, at night? It becomes suffocatingly dark and creepy, it feels much, much smaller.  
During the day, the faster it moves. We all see it as a white shadow that blurs by us. Sometimes the shadows would come *very* uncomfortably close to us (I was touched and attacked on one of our outings, but more on that later) and even touches us.    
  

As the night wore on, the typical hand-tapping-over-mouth-while-screaming type of battle-cry. The thing that gets to me is that, within a group of 9 people, *all* of us heard every sound and all described it the same way. At one point during the night, we split into 2 teams, one team was left at ""basecamp"" (an area outside of the park) and the rest of us went back to keep exploring. During the first 15 minutes, we began to hear music and battle-cries. It would first appear to come from one direction, it would suddenly be *behind us*. It had us going in circles. We had walkie-talkies and we radio'ed basecamp:  
""Are you guys screaming
*""No

At that point, the kind you get after dragging your sock'ed feet on the carpet and touching metal.  
  
  
We sat down on the large rocks and remained silent. Soon after, He told me that while we were sitting there, he felt a hand caress the back of his neck and up to his hair. I could understand why he felt unnerved).  
  
While sitting in this spot, white misty-shadow zooming between the trees that were no more than 20 feet away. What makes it interesting is that it wasn't a constant. Every few minutes we'd see a new one in a new spot and all of us (as if on queue) would point it out. At this point, we were very rattled and got our shit and walked the 10 mns back to the basecamp to pack and go home. It seemed the longer we were there, the more brazen it got and we just didn't want to fuck around with whatever it was. It was obviously capable of touch and that was very unsettling.  
  

On our way home, we're happy.  
  

Our Team Leader has most of our evidence but I do have a few pictures from that night, so no promises.

This went on all night until at some point sleep got the better of him under the covers.

The next morning when sitting around for breakfast he relayed the story to Joe and his family

Apparently Joe got tired of waking up and seeing her standing over him, which was a newer addition, added by his family after the purchased the house.

Here's to this subreddit getting some legs!

----------------------------------
I was originally going to type this out at work, and I got what I deserved.

Ever since childhood I can recall pondering and questioning things. I was suspicious of the Santa Claus lie, something to fear. I am now an atheist and very scientifically inclined.

When I was in first grade my parents moved from Ottawa to El Salvador, the land was a coffee grow. So, no real history, no one died there, as far as I'm aware.

I was young, I was safe. It took some work, but I finally got over my fear. This occurred by the time I was around 11, or 12.

It didn't last long. I am 21 years old now. I fear the dark.

THE SPIRAL AND THE LADY

First, you will be in the living room. To your left is a bathroom, and some steps, which make a U-turn and go upstairs. To your right is the living room, ahead is the dining room, yard. As you get upstairs, ahead of you is a wall with the light switch, the second mine and my brother's. To your left, is the ceiling. So from the spot where the stairs turn to go up

The upstairs is the setting for the following story.

My first unusual experience in that house was very low-key. It would have gone unregistered and forgotten if it weren't for the fact that someone else saw it too. I was lying in bed, since my bed was facing it at the time. About four feet from the floor, on the door, was this faint, almost not there... Spiral. It would slowly wind into itself, disappear, then pop back into existence. Rinse and repeat. The entire process would take about five seconds. I remember thinking it was ""gathering"". I don't know what that means, it was so damned faint that I could have believed it wasn't there. Plus

In the morning, I thought, seeking my attention. So I didn't give her any more clues: I told her to tell me what she saw, exactly. I vividly remember her tracing the pattern of the spiral in the air, while she was telling where it was, and how it faded into itself before popping back to existence.

But after she confirmed my sighting, I would have lost my mind that night. I don't know why, but I feel like that was the lady, gathering energy or something. I don't fucking know. But this is where the mildness ends.

Fast forward to about a year later.

For some reason I kept waking up every night for about two weeks now. It was always at a time when everyone was asleep. I would just wake up, so that my bed was against the wall next to the bathroom, so I had a diagonal view of the hallway and the top of the stairs. I turned left while lying down, and when I did, I caught something white on the corner of my eye. I turned to look at it and saw a white, long shape floating about two feet below the ceiling, high up above the steps. My first reaction was to look away, but it was facing the wrong way. And anyway

It was a fucking lady.

As my mind processed the details my body tightened and my brain attempted to jump out of my skull. My eyes burned every fucking horrible detail into the back of my skull, with slipper-like shoes.

I am being 100% honest. I don't want to keep writing about it. I almost had a panic attack. It's been a while. I think you got the idea. Nothing much happened after anyway

If I didn't bore you all to death I could write the next chapter about the taunting and why I cannot deny

Conclusion to this story, AND REASSURANCE

EDIT: Wow 40+ votes already! Thanks guys. I seriously thought I was boring you all to death. Gimme like eight hours, and I'm not fucking around here when that happens.

A REQUEST

But wait, try searching for ""Junkyard ghost"". It's a video I saw on the news a few months after which made me SCREAM when I saw it. It's just surveillance footage of this white figure floating around this car... The car was wrecked earlier that day and some lady died.

I have no way to prove this story


My parents decided to start her on radiation therapy, and bedridden mostly. My parents hire a nurse to help take care of her. By May she barely talks, and the doctor starts giving her morphine. By this point I had made peace that she had lived a long fulfilling life and I'm very content and prepared for her death.


The Friday before mother's day, but this thought was just in my head ""my grandmother has passed away."" I looked at the clock and it's 4:05am. I feel this really unexpected but very pleasant feeling of peace and calm. This lasted probably 30 seconds, and I went right back to sleep. 


My boyfriend and I wake up the next morning and I immediately go check my cellphone because I knew what was coming. I read a text from my dad that says ""You're grandmother passed away at 4am. Your mom is doing ok.""  I called my dad and explain to him that I knew she passed away because I felt it last night. They are a little confused and honestly so was I because I couldn't explain it.

I was totally shocked, and I quickly realized that I was dreaming; however, I truly felt her presence was very real. While she was sitting on my bed, I hugged her and told her that I was sorry for not being there when she was in the last days of her life. I hugged her again and then she walked out of my dorm room.

Alright
This happened when I was twelve or thirteen. I was laying in bed around 10:50 and I heard this whistling noise outside my window. I don't mean right outside my window, to clarify it wasn't ever the kind of whistling typical of people calling their dogs, it was a slower more drawn out whistle last 6 or 7 seconds. This is also the first time I have ever told anyone about this... For some reason I just always felt like I shouldn't. 

Number 2:
This happened to my mother actually, and each knock indicated a letter in the alphabet; example: A=1 knock, Z=26 knocks. Her mom died from lung cancer when she was probably 10-11. The night her mom died she heard knocking on the wall from her sister's side, but it went way past 26, or spelled out nonsense. Eventually it stopped and she went to bed.

Hearing my friend make such a bold claim, however, was interesting, and my reaction to her story was basically “Prove it.” My friend Raphael (Raph for short) was also interested to see this business

One night when Raph's mom went out,” a “no,” the digits 0-9, all the letters of the alphabet, a “goodbye” space, and the fancy pictures in the corners. It basically looked like [this](http://www.brainjar.com/dhtml/ouija/graphics/board.jpg). 

We went up to Raph’s attic, dusty, ornate mirror. Raph tells me that he hangs out in his attic a lot, and he apparently wrote the word ""hi"" in the dust of the mirror. Even knowing that he did it, it was still pretty creepy. I sat with my back to the mirror because I didn't want to look at it. I will try to get a picture of his attic if I can and post it in an update just for clarification.
Anyway, she said, meant that the spirit was trying to escape the board. She warned against pressing too hard on the oracle. Finally, she said to be respectful to the spirits. She had brought candles, salt, and a silver cross with her. Raph and I did not care too much about the rules of the board. Raph actually broke out a bottle of gin he had managed to find while she was explaining and started pouring him and myself shots. By the end of the night, I had put down over half of the bottle of gin myself, it was also raining that night. Sound like a horror movie yet?

Now, I am going to refer to it as the “contact,” unless it gave us a specific name with which to address it. I’m not going to call it a spirit because, honestly, I’m very skeptical about paranormal claims. It is what it is regardless of what I believe, but for our purposes here, it is “the contact.”

After about five minutes, so I did not know what to expect. Also, I have never had an inactive Ouija session; we always make some kind of contact fairly quickly. Anyway, we made a contact. I honestly do not remember this contact, so it must not have been very important. All I do remember is that all of our friends were excitedly asking questions while Raph and I did shots and tried to guess who was moving the oracle. After that contact, we made another which was equally uninteresting. When our group was finished with the second contact, Raph and I interrupted the session. “Let us hold the oracle, “and we’ll see what happens.” As expected, having drunk at least a third of the bottle at this point. 

The first two sessions did not stick in my memory. There is a reason the third one did. When we asked this third contact for its name, and it replied “z.” Kim asked Z if its name referred to some kind of ending. Raph must have told his sisters that we were doing a Ouija board in the attic, because at that very moment, we heard a loud, high-pitched scream come from somewhere in the house. Raph unhitched the attic staircase and ran downstairs to find his sisters laughing. It was a pretty good prank; we were all shaken. Their timing was unfortunately impeccable. Anyway, once Raph came back up from yelling at his sisters, we continued the session. 

We talked to Z for a while. When asking Yes/No questions,” but when we asked it what it was it once again gave us a “0.” Raph, getting a bit angry with Z, said “Come on! Do you even fucking exist?” to which it also responded “0.” At a certain point, Kim said that she could feel the room had grown colder, and a couple of friends immediately agreed. I told her that I didn’t think the room was any colder, but then again, and so she asked Z if it was good or evil. As per usual, is that the longer we talked to Z

I think Raph was a little tipsy at this point, for a few years now, studied a variety of spiritual practices with his father, and so I can only assume that led him to do what he did next. He announced that he was going to ask Z a question. He asked Z if it was an enlightened being. Z very quickly answered with a “Yes.” Raph then asked Z how it went about unlocking all of its chakras. Instead of spelling, as a contact usually does, it started moving between pictures on the Ouija board. Specifically, it moved between the picture of the sun on the top-left corner of the board and the picture of the woman with her hand on an oracle on the bottom-right corner of the board. Z moved quickly back and forth between these two images with increasing speed. It did this for a solid 10 seconds when Raph yelled “Alright

It was at this point that one of my other friends reminded Kim of one of her rules about not letting the oracle go to all four corners of the board. Kim asked Z if it was trying to escape from the board, but that's what the hell happened. Kim went through some of her closing rituals, flipping the board and repeating some mantras. We had fun the rest of the night, and nothing else of notoriety happened that night.

Fast forward to the present - Raph and I have a much more vital interest in these things and we talk about things of this nature whenever we are together. Our friendship is different than most peoples' - it is a spiritual friendship.

I have bad dreams often, but you can't be woken and you don't remember it. It's more distressing for those around you than anything else.

There is one recurring dream that seems to overlap the two. I remember the dream, and only realize it's happening when I've already leapt out of bed - the dream happens in an instant and has no sense of plot or duration. It's been happening for years. The past theory was it was just part of the whole night terrors thing, and that if it happened more than once in a week I should go get my levels tested to see if my hormones were off. 

I dream that there is an indistinct, whenever it happens, I have an immediate and violent GET THE FUCK OUT FROM UNDER IT reaction and flee the bed in terror, usually waking up in the hallway or kitchen gasping from adrenaline.

""This was when your mother was still little and sweet. 

We had just finished moving into a new house. The last thing to be moved was an old Victorian-Craftsman-style mirror that your grandpa gave to me. It took two densely-built men to lift it into the house

We settled in and got comfy quickly after that.

While getting your mother ready for bed one night, unscratched and in one piece. 

Because the mirror was so heavy

We ran through every possibility, completely un-shifted. The head of the nail was too wide and too thick for the cord to have been able to slip over it and fall. I knew no one could have moved it, either. Your mother was too little to reach it, let alone handle it without damaging it, and by that time your grandpa and I had already been divorced. The doors and windows were locked; I went around and checked myself.

We tossed the mirror out about two years after this instance, with no explanation.”

1336728578.0,thycx,[FAM] Ruckus In Parents' Bedroom,focereal,26,0,2,"It's a fact in our house that I'm prone to experiencing unexplainable and weird things. This left my family frustrated in many occasions, our older brother was there, mind you.

First off, with three bedrooms. The master bedroom is on the left side of the house [opposite the kitchen], and the other two rooms are to its right [across the living room]. The kitchen/dining room and livingroom are open floor space with only a huge tv storage unit dividing it in between. The walls are made of thick concrete creating an effective sound barrier for privacy. Even if you scream, it will be very hard to hear you, unless you shout through the slight gap beneath the door.

Well, and I just got back home from school that day, and were watching tv. Actually, I was passed out on the couch thus having no recollection of the incident. My sister said, at first, they heard a muffled sound coming from our parent's closed bedroom, as if someone was having a very loud conversation. That in itself was weird, clearly busy doing backyard work. That's when they roadrunnered their way out of the house and told our dad what was going on inside his room. I think I should mention that those two turdnuts left me inside the house all by myself while they were safely next to our dad.

Our dad grabbed his machete and ran inside to check what was going on. I'm not sure if our dad heard the ruckus inside the room as well though. Anyway, not until they [finally!] remembered I was still fast asleep on the couch. My sister said they found me still snoring away but now tuckered inside my favorite blanket that they swore was nowhere near me earlier.

My sister said it was probably our mom trying to get our attention. I don't remember much about her and her last days but supposedly she locked herself inside that room all the time when she was sick. Because she always had the door closed

Anyway, so I was alone in the house for a week. This was probably not the greatest thing for someone grieving over such a recent loss, but I think I needed to be alone anyway, at least for a little while.

So im in the house, just because I'm alone. (or thats what I tell myself.) This strange energy seems to hang in the air near my mom and dad's room, sadness, very strange. I feel totally fine downstairs, so I just attribute the feeling to grief. But still, it's not like only her room reminded me of her, everything did. The night progresses, it's like... she's in there? Crying? (I know it sounds silly

I go to bed, very angry. I get the feeling that she wants my dad to get back. I think she hates me being up so late as well. These are just the feelings I got, every single night I was alone in that house.

Every night, so I had to close the door at about the 3rd night. Again this sounds crazy, but I swear to god in my mind I constantly heard this soft crying, like imagined but it was so real. I was so scared when I heard noises, I came extremely close to just camping out at my best friends house for the rest of the week. I felt like I was going crazy, with the energy that was emanating from my moms room. The door was closed, but I could sense her. I told my friend about all this and she asked me why I didn't just ask my mom if she was ok. I said that I knew I would definitely hear something if I did

When my dad finally got back, but then 5 months later christmas arrived and the energy came back.

My dad is... let's just say... very sentimental about everything involving my mother. He was having an extremely difficult time that christmas, you felt angry near the christmas tree but fine upstairs. I quizzed my family about their emotions in different areas of the house, and they had the same reactions as me. Odd, right? Leaving the house made you feel fantastic, it was very strange. 

A few days into my dad's strange behavior, a bb pellet that my brother left on the floor after fooling around with his broken bb gun (which was in his room) FLEW with a *pop* across the floor about 15 feet. Then, suddenly, this big heavy wooden divider plank thing that had been sitting in the corner for years suddenly SMASHED over onto the floor. We all sat in stunned silence, it was only us three in the room, sitting. My dad completely believed me after that, and we happily decorated the tree. 

Guess what? After that the feeling of sadness and anger was gone

I know we're not supposed to talk about dreams, mom is ALWAYS alive. In mine I ask her where she's been, why she's been gone so long. She always has a weird excuse. My brother had a dream where he entered the living room and my mom was sitting there, smiling, surrounded by a slight golden glow. He said it was the most vivid dream he's ever had.

 This is a true story of what happened to me while working at a hospital. I really don’t care much if you believe me

It begins sometime in May 2010. I started working at a small hospital in my hometown; I'm an OR tech, we only have 4 Operating Rooms. On the same floor, we have the ICU and the maternity ward. During my graveyard shifts, I start with my list of things that need to be done, I always finish my work then turn everything off and just sit at the front desk. Basically, do nothing until morning. Everything started off great, then things started to get weird. I met with the Security Supervisor of the hospital and he told me about something that happened that night.

He was checking the floors and went into the Pediatric Ward to make his rounds. The PW was on the 4th floor at this time and half the floor was closed due to renovations, believe me, it’s a creepy place. The search went for an hour but they found nothing, I got chills when he told me that.

A couple of days went by. I was doing my usual routine work and that time I was alone here (I am actually writing this from work) preparing the OR for the next day. The room where we store the sterile instruments is very small, I finished early and went to the front desk to rest a little. As soon as the clock hit 3:00 am everything changed. You could feel the heaviness in the air, suddenly I heard what I thought was all the instruments fall to the floor. All the packages just hitting the floor, it was a hell of a noise; scared me shitless. I got up and walked to the hallway, I was angry. If an instrument package falls to the floor, I have to re-sterilize it so, I went back there to check the damage. To my surprise, I searched everywhere and everything was normal. That scared me and it got me thinking if I had really heard that noise or if I had accidentally fallen asleep and was just dreaming. That had me scratching my head all night. The rest of my shift was the usual

Next night I had the graveyard shift, while walking down the hallway, I heard the chair inside the first OR move. I stopped walking, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Being curious, I looked through the window of the first OR and found that the chair had move from one side of the room to another. I was like ""WTF is happening here?!"". I went back to the front desk and stayed there the entire night scared as hell. I could hear the fucking chair move all night. At this point, I was contemplating leaving my job but I just ignored it and a couple of weeks later I was used to it.

But nothing was going to prepare me of what was going to happen the next nights…

EDIT: I'm so Sorry guys I know you want more Ill be posting later today the second part of the story I just want to make it as chronological as possible please be patient and stay tuned... :)

It was May of 1996 and I was 18 years old, doing that program for high schoolers where you get both high school and college credit.

It started either the night before or after my brother's birthday, nonsensical dream.  It was just silly.  The kind of dream you don't remember when you wake up, and if you do, you think ""why the hell did I have that dream? Silliness.""

In my dream, and there was a sweet smell in the air.  Just sweet - no further description.  Nondescript sweet.  

Something very important had just happened.  What that important thing was I didn't know in real life or consciously

Then, I've used this descriptor) it was like I was in a James Bond movie, darting around corners, shooting at people, hiding from bullets.  (James Bond was what I compared it to because Goldeneye came out the year before and the sort of hiding, dodging, and shooting action seen in that movie was what it was like.)

And that was it.  That was the end of the dream.  It was a stupid dream - no memorable elements to it.

But then I *couldn't stop thinking* about this dream.  It occupied my thoughts at random times from when I got up in the morning to when I was in school to when I went to sleep at night.  This only punctuated the stupidity of the dream

As the days went by, but unknown to my conscious mind.  Walking through the mall.  Something important.

I had been to Three Rivers Mall in Kelso twice, when I was 15. Three Rivers Mall was just a totally underwhelming mall in a small town along the freeway.  

As the days passed

After nine days had passed

So the next day

It was the mid-morning.  Traffic heading south out of the area was a tiny bit congested - no real slowdowns

It was then I first noticed the van.

In 2003, was a then-current (like, no more than 1 or 2 model years older, so as old as 1994 at most) either Ford Aerostar or Chevy Astro.  Now that I review images of each I'm pretty sure it was the Aerostar - I remember the sharp downward slope with which the front of the vehicle angled toward the ground, the two rear windows that could've been mistaken for a large single rear window from a distance.  I don't think it had all the default windows visible, though the rear windows and the window behind the passenger seat were unblocked.

http://i.imgur.com/QpBpYMC.jpg

But it wasn't the windows I noticed first.  The first thing I actually noticed was that the van had no rear license plate.  And when my eyes gradually shifted upward to check the rear window to see if I could see a temporary plate taped into the window, square object draped with a cloth, about the size of a dishwasher or washing machine.

I was in the right lane

A man was driving.  White male, normal body size, in a normal white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and no tie.  

As I slowly came completely around the front of the vehicle

It just baffled me.  I couldn't understand why someone would be driving on the freeway with no license plates.  I mean.. why?  If a patrolman saw it

I slowly shifted back to the right lane and let myself gradually fall back, more stocky white male, also in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sporting Billy Mays style facial hair, sat in the seat behind the passenger seat.  

These guys looked totally government

I gradually slid back into the position I was in when I first noticed the van had no rear license plate.  My slow tour around the perimeter of the vehicle had not yielded many answers

I decided to go around again.  I switched lanes behind the vehicle, switched lanes again, and slowed to let them pass me again so I could scrutinize the passenger side of the vehicle again.  It was during that last part that they began to speed up.  They passed me, accelerating.  I hit the gas, too, and followed them right along.  We were going faster and faster.  They were up to something and it couldn't be positive.

Within a couple of miles they hit 80, but I was losing them.  

I was probably nearing a quarter of a mile behind their speeding, ran inside and said I needed to call 911 - they gave me the store phone.  Based on past experience, I knew that when there's a freeway emergency, you have to ask for state patrol 911.  So I dialed 911, then asked for state patrol 911.  They patched me through.  I said frantically that I was at exit 39 and there was a white van with no license plates going probably 110 mph south on the freeway, and that they were probably a couple miles further south by this time.  The operator said they'd get a patrol car on it.  I thanked them and hung up.

And that was that.  It was over.  The guys in the shop were looking at me.  I thanked them for the use of their phone and went back out to my car.  My heart was pounding and racing.  I took a few deep breaths of the cool

I was looking across the parking lot at Three Rivers Mall.

I stared.  It was pure coincidence that this is the exit I'd taken.  It was because I began falling too far behind the van.  The van must've been the important thing that just happened from my dream.  With nothing else to do

I walked in the entrance on the right [in this diagram](http://threeriversmall.com/directory) and headed toward the main thoroughfare.  It wasn't until I was completely past it that I realized that the warm, and I was even more shocked than I had been before.  I was lost in marveling over the impossibility of all this, and saw KB Toys, so I casually drifted over, deciding to play with stuff.  They had a video game setup at the entrance to the store, a first person shooter of some kind, given the date it was likely Duke Nukem 3D or something similar.  I'd casually played FPSs at school on the computers since Castle Wolfenstein in 1992, and I knew how to handle the controls.  After a short time running around corners, hiding

Still, if he was at all legit, he may be useful. He told us he could pinpoint the exact spot we performed the ritual and we told him to show us. 

He lead us to the exact spot. The exact spot in a big open field of grass. It was a little weird

As we got deeper and deeper into the woods, the sicker I got. We were about a quarter mile deep into the woods when I had to stop by a tree to rest. I was resting, Chris made us all be quiet because he could hear something. After quieting down, we could all hear it. Someone was saying something, over and over again, and it sounded like it was very slowly getting closer. It was some two syllable word, we all listened intently until we all had the same revelation of what it was saying, without saying a word to each other, say ""DONALD""

We ran to the apartment and got drunk without talking

We didn't hold off on going back. This was the most climactic part of the story. I can tell more of it in the comments, we came clean with the Pagan girl, and she decided to do a cleansing ritual in the apartment. Upon it's completion the whole place smelled like sulfur for a while. She did one alone at the park the same night. Nothing has happened since then.

1364598464.0,1b9skk,[ME] [FR] Haunted. Asked for it. One week of terrifying experiences. Part 3,alexmc88,36,13,21,"Part 1 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b694g/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/
 
Part 2 - http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b6xl7/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

Now, but I had to have been being absolutely insane not to notice all of these things happening in a pattern over the week. It baffles me to this day that it took so long for me to piece this all together, but so far, I just thought I had seen something creepy here and there. Anyway, this is what was happening after the church night:

I hadn't been sleeping well at all. For about a week. I was getting anxious and stressed all the time for no reason. I'm a very carefree, I mean, I'd be lucky for 3-4 hours a night. I didn't know where this odd stress and paranoia was coming from. Anyway, this next part is a bit hard for me to write because it has to do with speculation and comparison relating a (possibly, possibly not) supernatural experience to a death of a friend of mine. I feel kind of like I'm tainting his memory just by saying this, but I'm just going to state facts and not say that anything that happened to me that day was foreshadowing or causing anything that happened to my friend. I'm sorry if that explanation seemed out of nowhere, but I had to put it down in this story just to put my guilt at ease.

I woke up around 8 am with about 3 hours of restless sleep from the night before. I want you to try something. Either have a nearby friend put your hand on your should, gentle shake, as though you're trying to wake someone up. Do you feel that little tingly sensation the moment the hand leaves your shoulder and the nerves in your arm get their wits back about them? That's what I awoke to that morning. I woke up with a tingling in my shoulder, and although I didn't feel being shaken, my brain's immediate first thought was, ""someone just had their hands on you."" I was the only one awake at that time. It was a bit odd, but then again, if I barely felt the aftermath of what my mind thought of as being shaken awake

I got ready just like any other day, there are 6 apartments and 3 floors. 2 doors on each floor. I'm on the bottom level, and the people across from me didn't own it. The people above me didn't own it, be the people across from them did. A lady I had never seen around the building before, (I've lived there 11 years) in her mid-40s came down and waited outside my door while I collected her cat. I have two cats of my own who are very good, bengal cats. When I went inside, my cats' tails were puffy, and it seemed indifferent to me, and gave it to my cats who were still in shock. Then

I still didn't think anything weird was going on at that point, the country area, a ways south of the city. I got off the interstate after 15 minutes of driving. I turned right, and headed down a 50-MPH stretch of road that I had to drive for about 6 miles. I pulled out right after a van passed by me going in the same direction. I followed them, going the same way, and they were going about 48 or 49, but I stayed behind them just because I was feeling lazy that day, and oddly saw nobody in the van. I only got to look for about 1 second though, in my state, so I waited for them to pass and slowed down to about 50. They kept pursuing me less than a car's length behind me

From 11:30-3:30am, John, texts me just then and asks me to bring him a red bull or two since he hadn't been sleeping well for the past few days and he worked the night shift. from 10-6:30 at a loony bin in our neighboring city just over the bridge. My sleep schedule was messed up beyond belief, so I said sure, and I got 4 red bulls and headed over. As I was driving through a residential area about 3 blocks from his work, I see a shape padding across the street, (actually crossing the street this time) and he looked up to see my car, and he does the same right in front of my car. It was a golden retriever. I open my door to see if I can call him over and check if he has tags, and he jogs right by me never taking his eyes off of me even while he's running the opposite way of where he was looking. I remember there was a car turning down the block in the same direction as me, wouldn't turn around and see a car coming at him. Thankfully the other car stopped

I wake up to a call or a  message from one of my friends, and my friend informs me that a friend of ours passed away last night around 4 am. I think it's a joke and start getting upset until he/she gives me all the details and I check with other friends to verify. It's true. My friend was leaving a party with 3 of my other friends. They were thoroughly drunk. They took a shortcut under a bridge near the college while walking back to the dorms, and they crossed the train tracks, long story short, one of them was hit by the train. He died on impact crossing the tracks. It was horrifying to hear. I'm not going to make any comparison or relate any events that were happening that night to each other, but that's what happened, and as far as I can guess, but I'd be willing to bet they were at the very least within the same hour. That's everything that happened that day, any insights

http://goo.gl/maps/JzsCd - This is where the van and I were. 100th Ave S. is the road I was followed on. I got off at i29

I'm not going to put any proof of the date or time or how my friend died. I'm sorry, and I feel like putting up a link to google maps where I saw the dog would be useless, but I guess I could if someone reeaally wants to know where it occurred exactly.",,False,,t5_2sntx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1b9skk/me_fr_haunted_asked_for_it_one_week_of_terrifying/

1361468524.0,18yqlq,Grandma's visits.,blasphumorus,34,8,14,"**bit of a backstory before the actual story.** **{{ME}}**

My grandmother and I have always had things in common. Before her passing in 2010, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, unexplained events, etc. 


I have always had an issue with the afterlife- ever since I was very young, to simply seeing a clouded figure walk right in front of me. While these are things I'm used to now, I still can't get over the experiences involving my grandmother. We had a long-standing joke about her coming back after death to ""keep an eye on me,"" and I think that's exactly what she's doing..


Last year, what kind of wildlife was in the brush, etc. I hadn't really thought of where we were going, but it just so happened that we ended up at a nearby phosphate mine. Now I don't know how many mines any of you have been to, but at 1am, they all look INCREDIBLY creepy. Trusting my gut, we decide to turn around and just try to watch the meteor shower at home.


While we're trekking back home, or go into a trance briefly when this happens. This isn't so great, however, when you're driving. I swerved into the other lane, then ripped back into ours. My fiance is freaking out, and I'm ""getting back to reality."" He just stares at me, and asks me if I'm having breathing issues. He then explained that it feels like his throat and chest are coated in icy hot, and why, that I'm driving about 55-60 mph here, and he stated that what I had just shared was almost 100% identical to how he was feeling. I don't know about any of you


Once we get home, to the detailing on her shoes. My fiance has never seen a picture, nor had a description of my grandmother in any way, shape or form. He then went on to tell me that she had pat him on the back and gave him a sense of approval, and that after that, he felt alone (as in, she vanished, but never I have I ever heard my fiance say that he has seen her... let alone interacted with her. 


I can say that this has brought us closer together, and SEE these things..

I posted this in AskReddit a few days ago.. I found A token [like this](http://i.imgur.com/Ah3Myb6.jpg) in my garden, It was around midnight, when I heard footsteps. I thought it was my dad or something walking around so I wrote it off, But it kept getting closer and was accompanied by heavy breathing, They sounded like pretty heavy boots, Steel-toe kind. The footsteps got closer until they reached my bed then stopped. I sat up to see what it was when it breathed in my ear, Then I heard it walking away while still heavily breathing. It wasn't sleep paralysis or anything

Ghosts:

When I was younger, And around half-way down were 2 young children, a boy and girl around 4 or 5, dressed in victorian clothing, The girl had a dress on and the boy had a blue shirt, brown trousers and suspenders. I walked toward them and they disappeared just before i reached them.

I freak the fuck out and scribble a note saying ""seen a ghost im at my friends"" and leave the back door open because I was out of there so fast.

Same house

Bit more recent. Circa 2008-2010. 
My dad and auntie had bought a house because they were both single and were struggling for money and I lived with them most of the time because my school was very close. They worked shift works and when I'd get in from school there was always an hour or so I had to myself where one had gone to work and the other was on the way back. I usually took these oppertunities to have 'happytime' or play rockband very loud. This particular time I was playing rockband. I had all the doors open and was playing the drums, it was the most cliche' moment of ever in my life.)

Also in that house there was a helicopter that flew to our house, waved then went back the way they came. My dad and auntie saw it too. We don't know who they were, could be someone who just got his flying liscence and saw us come out of our house I dunno.

Anyway current house 2011- today.
In this house I've had time slow down on me, had bowls dropped in the middle of the kitchen when theres none out and all that crap. Casual hauntings. But this story is the most scared I've ever been in my life. If I can find the article about it in the paper I shall link yall up. But I'll get to that later. 
Right, behind that. Almost as if its orbiting the earth). Anyway it shoots all the way up over my head and as I turn to see where it went I am greeted by huge fucking balls of bright cloud spinning in a perfect circle and smaller ones inside that spinning the oposite way and another ring inside that spinning the opposite way to that. My immediate reaction is ""LIAM WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT"" He turns around and becomes speachless. I start running to my house yelling at Liam to hurry up but he is completley dumbfounded. He cant tell his girlfriend what is happening and he cant move. I yell at him ""COME ON IM NOT STAYING HERE."" 
This disc is hovering above a house that is literally about 40 meters away from us. I cant budge him
He doesn't believe me at first but when he notices I'm as white as a sheet he comes outside to see. 
Nothing.
Theres nothing there.
Then when we are about to go back inside It rises up above the house directly infront of us. It could of passed for some kind of ellaborate light show at first but no
I tried to record it but when I pointed it at the lights my phone just went all pixilated. Everyone else tried it and got the same results.

We all think my dad got abducted at one point which my Auntie and Grandma were witness too but thats another story. Not a lenghty one

Continuing with the story, she described them as two really tall and skinny white humanoids observing her while she slept.

Anyways, with only one occurring more than once.

The first is one of a dog. This dog looked strikingly like our old dog Tasha. I have only seen pictures of the old girl, as my mom was washing my at the time baby brother. I saw a shockingly calming image of a dog, matching closely the physical and size-related description of Tasha I had been given from the pictures I had seen. She looked off in the distance, silently barking at something before vanishing. I immediately told my mom, and was told to ignore it. I told my pops a month or so ago, and gave the description of the image, and he firmly believes it to be his dog. She is buried in the backyard, going so far as to try and re-wash me with her tongue after baths when I was a baby.

Next, he sat and watched me. Once or twice, when I looked at him, he looked up from something, as if I were distracting him from something. He would quickly vanish after I met his eyes. I stopped seeing him around my 7th birthday, if I recall correctly. He always appeared basked in light, never in a dark corner or anything of the sort.

Lastly, and dear Tasha had yet to be replaced, so it couldn't have been a pet, as fish can't fly. Yet. I digress. I felt confused as to what it was, and tried to follow it into the laundry room. I found nothing.

When Ashleigh was about 15 months old, ash was particularly fussy and I attributed it to teething and put her to bed at her usual time.

One evening, like toddlers have, erupted over my head. It really freaked me out, mostly because I'd never heard it before. I went to bed a while after that.

On one of our little excursions he became really excited about visiting an old insane asylum called The Ridges.  The place sat on a large hill and driving up to the old building was a creepy experience in itself.  The main, but we arrived right before closing.

We didn't park in front, we got out and walked around.  We were generally just enjoying the silent, reverent atmosphere and not really feeling or expecting anything creepy.

We walked around a bit more... anyone been there?  I think the Ohio University has a high ropes course nearby.  Anyway about an hour later, and then decided to go get something to eat.

The car was where we left it by the cemetery, there was an asphalt courtyard of sorts.  It could have served as parking, or a loading area.  We pulled in about halfway, realized that it was a dead end, and began to turn around.  It was then that I noticed something written on one of the windows on the third floor.  I could not easily read it, so I stopped the car, and we got out.

It was written across the width of the window, an ""i"", but it took us a minute.  Then it hit me.  It was written from inside the window, so it appeared backwards to us.  It was a name- ""timmy"".

And just as I figured it out and said it out loud, then backed away slowly.  We both saw it, our jaws hitting the pavement.

Before I continue, there has been a prevalence of night-terrors, some of which have been so intense that they actually wake up all the inhabitants of the household. They share a common trait, in that it typically involves my screaming and shouting in what I hesitate to call a ""language,"" but do so only because it differs from the typical incoherent dream-speak that so often accompanies these things; instead, these words are very intelligible, not mumbled, as it prevents them from proper sleep when it occurs as well.

Since he woke me up, I didn't really understand what was happening. He waited until I gained more control of my mental faculties, and explained that something had come into his room. 

During this time period, and he told me that she opened the door and entered the room (which was rare: she usually just called the dogs from the doorway), shut the door behind her, and then stood over his proper bed for quite some time, just staring down at where he normally slept, but without moving or speaking or making any sound at all. 

Initially, he said that she remained standing over his bed; as he fully awoke, he felt a deep and incredible fear, and something in him told him to keep silent and not try to get her attention. Something was wrong. After what he claimed to be a substantial period of time, the figure that appeared to be our mother began to seem less and less like her, and more and more like a living apparition from a nightmare, and it began muttering incomprehensibly, and eventually turning to look towards the futon-couch for some time before dissipating into the shadows.

How does this relate to my night terrors? Around this same period, lacking any eyes and only possessing nostril slits and a predatory mouth, would torment me in my sleep. I was not in the habit of sharing my nightmares with anyone, but I kept a private journal where I would sketch the figures I'd see or words I would hear during my states of sleep paralysis which inevitably followed my waking. 

When my brother explained to me the feeling of complete and abject fear that set in as this figure who feigned to be our mother slowly transformed into whatever it was that it is, saying that he could not ever forget it because of the horror it instilled within him. I asked him to describe it, and, if he could, sketch a picture. As he scrawled the figure, the fear solidified: a hunched, humanoid creature

1375578627.0,1jnmyf,The Ghost Flute,CoriOreo,25,2,10,"In 2009, I would be given plenty of privacy, but we certainly had fun trying.

After a couple weeks of searching, with stairs against the house’s rear wall.  My bedroom was in the attic, with a window at the front of the room, overlooking the yard and street, and a small vent in the floor directly above the front door.  It wasn’t actually connected to any air system, but was just a hole between the floors.  My mom and I often spoke to each other through it when one of us was upstairs. 

While we were getting settled, asked me to do him a small favor.  He was always a strange guy.  He had lived a borderline nomadic childhood all over the United States with his mother and siblings, and had a patchwork of interests and talents.  One of his more interesting quirks was his earnest belief in old European folklore, things like faerie rings and ghosts.  He had me fill several jars with dirt and place them at all entrances to my room – the door, the window, and the vent.  When I asked why, he seemed slightly sheepish, “spiritual nasties” would have to count each grain of dirt in the jar before they could gain entrance to an area.  

“How do you count a grain of dirt?” I asked.

“Exactly

My mom had a new boyfriend around this time as well.  His name was Harry

A solid six months passed in the house without incident.  In February of 2010, the talking stopped, I heard footsteps to my mom’s bedroom, and things eventually became quiet.  I figured Harry had gone home.  When I went downstairs, however, I heard a light snoring from my mom’s room, and peeked inside to see Harry curled in the bed with her.  It appeared that they had only fallen asleep together and nothing more, not some stupid old guy who smelled like Patchouli.  


By the time I had stumbled back to bed, for how long I don’t remember anymore, and eventually slipped down into my sheets, and kept crying until the tears petered out and I fell asleep on a wet pillow.

And then

I remember that it was 1:00 because that was the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes.  I wasn’t groggy; I woke and was immediately fully conscious, the noise that had woken me sounded again, and I found myself stiffening with annoyance.  It sounded sort of like a wooden flute or a recorder, playing just a single flat note for several seconds before falling slightly in pitch and ending.  The note was unremarkable, differing only in length each time it sounded, and there was no variance in its tone or any tremble of breath.  What the hell it was, I didn’t know, and it was coming through the vent that opened up downstairs.

I knew immediately that it was Harry.  Harry was being a stupid hippie and having some sort of weird flute ritual in our living room at one in the morning.  Fuck me.  I was filled with such livid anger that I wanted to storm downstairs and scream at him for waking me up, for the same length of time, sounding exactly the same, and startling me awake again.  Every single time I heard it I felt angrier than I’d ever been, but I still didn’t leave my bed.  

In the sixth minute or so, longer note, like that of a muffled trumpet.  This one didn’t exactly sound like it was coming from the living room; it was more ambient, indistinct.  It played less frequently than the flute, but it, too, stayed on a single steady note every single time it sounded.  There was no pattern to either of the noises, at the times where they played simultaneously

For full minutes I just laid there and let myself be stabbed with tiny needles each time I heard these noises.  Gradually, and eventually the flute sounded once more on its own and then was silenced.  I waited for a minute, two minutes, waiting for it to come back, but it never did.  I opened my eyes again and looked at the clock.  The time was 1:10 in the morning.

I tried to fall back asleep, and the more awake I was, the angrier I became.  I should have gone downstairs and bitched at him to cut it out while it was happening.  Was I really so afraid of conflict that I wouldn’t even stand up to an old dork with a flute, who was doing something objectively rude in another person’s house?  I threw back my covers and put my bathrobe back on for warmth.  The air in the attic was chill and some bare light from the neighbors’ driveway was lighting up the inside of my curtains.  I scuffed over to the window and pinched open the blinds to look down on the street.

Harry’s van wasn’t there.

I blinked.  Harry never went anywhere without his van.  A strange feeling began worming its way into my stomach.  I hitched my bathrobe up a little more and headed for the stairs.  The living room was entirely dark and empty.

“Mom?” I called.

She was already partially awake.  She always wakes up about four times every night to use the bathroom.  With her bedroom directly next to the living room

“Hear what?” she asked

“That noise – is Harry still here?”

“No, I thought there was something in her voice which said she was unhappy that I’d noticed his presence in the house.  “He left around midnight.”

“But you didn’t hear all that noise just now?”

“No

I went back to bed and didn’t fall asleep for a long time.

It wasn’t a terrifying experience for me – at least not at the time.  I was angry and defiant rather than curious, “It’s better that you didn’t go down.”

“Why

“Maybe

 I try to be open-minded to the stuff he believes in

He just kind of shrugged.  “You might too

It was late afternoon

So I was by myself downstairs while my parents were up in their room watching television. A half hour after my sister left, ""Hey"".

My sister doesn't answer

""What are you doing?"" I ask. 

""Going upstairs, emotionless voice and does just that. I watch as she thuds upstairs and hear her open the door to her room and close it. 

Not five minutes pass-- I don't think much of it because there's not much to think about. Until the front door swings open.

I wheel around to see who is coming in since everyone who lives here is upstairs. But I am rendered speechless and stuck to my seat as none other than my sister walks in.

She kicks off her shoes and heads toward the stairs.

I finally snap out of it and jump out of the chair. I grab her arm. ""You just went up there

For context, as the computer is right next to the stairs. I would've known, seen, and heard it all. 

She looked at me like I was crazy. ""I didn't come in until now. I'm going upstairs."" And she thudded up.

Well I am very shaken to say the least and immediately follow her, only to find it empty. I ran back out and burst into my parent's room.

""You guys hear anyone come up here recently?"" I asked. Of course they said no.

I even checked my room, saw her completely. No peripheral vision stuff, no double-takes, no shadows. She was solid, I looked at her steadily for about fifteen seconds. It was not late-night, I was not tired. I've gone over it so many times but I am certain I saw her walk up there.

Now that I think about it the apparition (as I've taken to calling it) was very shallow

I told my sister

I might post more about some other stuff that has happened in my house (I've lived here for 11 years).

My (now ex) boyfriend and I were not getting along with our roommates. They pretty much refused to clean anything and it got to the point that we were just always on each other's nerves. Every day was a fight. The stress was taking toll on our already rocky relationship. We decided to get a place of our own. We looked around and most everything we looked at was out of our price range since he wasn't working.

I found an apartment for rent in my budget online. We went to look at it and it was huge. It was bigger and less expensive than anything we had looked at. We asked why it was so cheap and the leasing agent told us that it was because the buildings were old and most people didn't consider them to be ""nice"" apartments because they lacked a lot of modern amenities. The buildings were built in the 40's to provide quick housing for World War 2 factory workers.

The buildings were solid block and concrete and naturally sound proof. You could vacuum at 3am and your neighbors would never hear you. The buildings were 3 stories tall and each floor had 3 apartments. They were all connected by a metal outside staircase. Each one had a huge window in the living room. 

We loved it and took it right then. We moved in that week. The boyfriend started a new job and we had lived there for about 2 months. Things weren't getting any better between us so I decided to call it quits. I had plans to move in with a friend as soon as her lease was up in 2 months. I was going to ride things out until then. I went to the Dr and got back on birth control because we had been trying for some time to have a baby. 

I moved in with my friend and shortly after found out I was pregnant in spite of the birth control. The boyfriend and I decided to try and work things out so I moved back in. 

I was about 8 weeks along. I was having really bad morning sickness. I'm talking the kind of puking where every time you move you puke. I tried to go into work but my boss took one look at me and sent me home. The boyfriend had to go to work shortly after I got back home. I stayed in bed for a bit but got to where I couldn't sleep anymore so I moved my trashcan and a blanket to the couch. I turned on the tv and started watching a movie.

About an hour or so into it I heard a knocking on the door. I figured it was a package and decided I didn't want to get up and answer it. I thought they would just leave it or leave one of the notes where we could pick it up later. About 15 minutes go by and the knocking starts again. I still don't want to answer the door. All my friends call or text before they come over so I knew it wasn't someone I knew. I just hoped they went away. 

20 minutes later the knocking started again. I figured it was someone from the apartment complex wanting to change the air filter or something. I get up not wanting to deal with any of this and look out the peep hole. I don't see anyone. I put it down to they got tired of waiting and go back to the couch.

As soon as I got settled the knocking happened again. I'm pissed off at this point. I go to the door look out the peep hole and see nothing. I open the door and don't see anyone. We were on the 1st floor but there was no where for a person to hide. If they had went up the stairs they were metal so I would have heard them and easily seen them. The only other place they could have gone was the parking lot which the front door over looked the whole thing. There was no one out there. I was a bit unnerved but shrugged it off. I went back inside.

I settled back onto the couch and within 10 minutes the knocking started again. I quickly jumped up and ran to the door and threw it open. There was no one there. I ran outside and looked all around. Nothing. I went back inside

She was there maybe 10 minutes before it happened again. We both opened the door and went out and looked. We both found nothing. We called my boyfriend and he came by on his lunch. it happened moments before he opened the door and walked in. He didn't see or hear anything walking up to the apartment. It didn't happen the whole time he was there and it never happened again. He thought we were both crazy and stormed off back to work.

After that we starting having a flood of activity. It was like whatever it was was announcing it's presence.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1gry53/me_friend_the_knocking/

Anyways, the custodians have also seen a black shadow swoop by in one of the classrooms. Some of our virus models have gone missing as well, and nobody admits to throwing them away.

1346610864.0,z8naa,The Lights Outside My Window [ME],JestersTrek,27,4,30,"I've been meaning to post this story somewhere on Reddit for quite some time, and I've always wanted to delve deeper into the exact meaning of why it happened

I am currently 28 years old. The events of this story happened when I was 7, my breathing becomes heavy and rapid, and my heart begins to race. I am a very cerebral individual, and whenever I experience this feeling, I tell myself that it's completely illogical and unnecessary, as I'm only looking at a picture, or a TV screen or some such. My body still disagrees. 

It began in 1991, after all the presents were opened and whatnot). My family and I had just moved out to the middle of nowhere, Virginia, about 30 minutes outside the capital, Richmond. I had lived my previous 7 years in the city, and was used to a more suburban environment. I remember not liking the idea of other kids not being around, but overall was excited about having a large place to run around and play.

At night, this habit had not changed. My room was on the second floor, and if you can imagine a reversed ""L,"" like, ""_I"" my window would be the underscore, and the other section of the house that I could see through my window would be the 'I.' My bed was pressed against the wall, parallel to the underscore, only lights

It was around 10PM, and reflecting off of the side of the house I see a circle of light, roughly three feet in diameter. Imagine a spotlight pointing directly on it, not at an angle, and remember I'm on the second floor of the house. It was not just one ""spotlight,"" though, as whatever was making the light was rotating, another followed

At this point you can imagine my 7 year old self was quite terrified. There's nothing that I knew of then

Being scared out of my mind

From then I have no memory. This of course makes no sense to me

Needless to say, I knew that as Christmas approached in 1992, I could expect to see those lights again, and I did. This time, of course, the blinds were down, but there was no hiding those lights

This occurred one more

I of course told my parents, and to this day they swear up and down they have no idea what I was talking about, and while they don't particularly believe in alien visitation themselves, they had seriously thought about getting me some kind of help because they could tell I had obviously been through something traumatic.

This is still a series of events that I think about often, or because I knew I needed to stop flailing in my sleep if I was ever going to keep a woman... probably a combination of the two).

This is the reason I believe in the alien abduction phenomena

Anyway, as I've never met anyone else who's been ""abducted"" (that I didn't immediately think was a crackpot, I mean).

A little back story. My parents are both from El Salvador and we still have a lot of family over there. I have gone almost every other summer since i was 3.

I don't have many memories of that time but i have never forgotten this dream. It starts off with me riding in a truck and i can tell we are in El Salvador. Its my aunts husband truck and hes driving. My aunt is in the passenger side and i am riding in the middle. We pull up to a small house with lots of people and cars. I notice that there is a lot of family members there. 

We walk in together. I notice a casket in the back of the living room. I had never seen one in person but i knew what it was. At first i wasn't sure if i should go up to it but i was curious. As i am walking towards it i am just about to look in when my mom wakes me up. 

I thought that was a weird dream. So i just brushed it off as nothing to worry over. About 2 weeks later my mom wakes me up in tears. It was maybe 5 in the morning. She tells me i am not going to school that day. I ask why and she tells me that my grandpa had died. It didn't really hit me there. I was just a kid and didn't really understand death yet.

We flew that day to El Salvador and went to my other grandparents house. The day of the wake a few family members were there. As we got ready to go they decided i would ride with my aunt and her husband. As we were riding i got this chill down my spine. I felt like i had been there.

We got to the wake and everything felt like it had happened before. Seeing my family, all this happened in my dream. I was in shock. I didn't talk much the rest of the day. 

I never told anyone for years. I have told a few people since then but most just say ""wow that's weird"" or something along those lines.

I was always uncomfortable up there, it just had an unsettling feel to it.  None of us used it, so the house may as well have been one story.

It was the summer, because we were sleeping in the living room, my brother was going to be there, and my dad is an extremely light sleeper.  We were planning on just staying up, the three of us, and just hanging out.

While I'm waiting for my friend to show up, and it is about the middle of the evening.  I do not remember the exact time it was then, but I know exactly how much time passed before I looked at the clock again.

After I checked the clock the first time

My friend and I were walking into the room with the stairway, so if he goes I have to go.  I'm trying to convince him to come back downstairs with me, but he won't listen.

We reach the top of the stairs

The scream doesn't even finish

Then I open my eyes, I hope.  I look at the clock again.  Only one minute has passed.  The storm hasn't even fully arrived yet.

The evening is uneventful until my friend arrives.  I don't know what I was thinking at the time

I told him I needed to get a drink of water first.  While I was getting my drink, I prayed that nothing would happen.

When I returned, except for the occasional flash of lightning and the flashlight itself.  We start up the stairs, and like before I was asking him to reconsider, to go back downstairs.  Like before, he didn't listen.

When we got to the top of the stairs, he didn't notice I was preparing for that.

Then we turned to the room in question, and we returned downstairs.

I didn't sleep easy after that.  By morning the storm had passed.  I asked my dad when he had closed the door upstairs, and wound up dragging me back upstairs.

The door was open

That door should not have been closed, and not until my dad finally moved out.  Twenty-two years and no one had ever bothered.

It's an old, the mid 1600's.  My great grandfather bought it when my grandmother was a kid, and before he bought it it had been owned by another family since it was built.  He decided to do some renovations on it when they moved in.  One thing that he decided was to move the staircase from one room to a different room.    There was a door at the top of the stairs that was open, and the construction workers needed it closed so they closed it.  However, it reopened immediately.  This happened several times.  Exasperated, they literally nailed it shut then took a lunch break.  When they came back, it was open again.  They left and refused to return.

Shortly after moving into the house, sudden infant death syndrome.  When I was a baby, around the age she was when she died, my mother would often hear a baby crying, go check on me, and find me sleeping.  Fast forward several years, my sister, very happy

When my younger brother was about 2 years old, he was out of sight of my mother but she could hear him.  There was no one else in the house.  All of a sudden my brother starts asking my mother who the man in the room is.  She called him into her room and didn't move until someone else came home.  When she was about 9, she remembers seeing an old man dressed in a plaid shirt in the same room he was in, as do several of my grandmother's siblings when they were young.  Also, when my nieces were younger they used to ask similar questions to my brother's, though one described him as a scary man.

I was upstairs by myself one day when I was probably between 10 and 12. I was in my brother's room for some reason

Now, as they never hurt us.  My sister used to ask them, at night, to show themselves to her.  One morning she woke up at 1:00 AM and saw the head (only the head) of a man with a black wide brimmed hat hovering over her.  She turned on the light and he vanished.  She told my father about it the next day, who's not the type of man to believe in these things, but before she described the man to him he told her he'd seen a man in a black wide brimmed hat with a black cloak in the playroom.

When my mother was growing up, and one of the beds in it would often shake for no discernible reason as they were trying to sleep.  However, it would stop if you told it to.  Except for one night when it drove my tough-as-nails drill sergeant aunt to tears in its refusal.

My grandfather had a brother who was struck by lightening and died at about 21.  One night, she wasn't touching him.  She felt that it was my great-uncle in their room that night, just telling my grandfather he was okay.

Also, ""I hate coming down this road.  I wish we didn't have to go down here.""  He had never been down the road before.  It was the road that my great-uncle had been struck by lightening on.  My great-uncle who died before my mother's oldest sibling was born.",,False,,t5_2sntx,True,,

She called my grandmother in Spain. She does this about once a month, and just to check up on the family. As she called, my grandmother picked up.

""You're never going to believe what happened yesterday.."" my grandmother anxiously told my mother.

""Did Manolo die?"" Asked my mother

""Yes...how did you...did someone tell you?"" wondered my grandmother.

1320988942.0,m8dut,[DIS] A list of various psychic phenomena I see. Would like feedback on what they might be.,Changing_shapes,26,2,27,"I can't remember exactly when I started to see these things but I can say it's been at least 4yrs+ that I've seen them. It all began in 10th grade when I dabbled in meditation and tried to see auras. I would observe my hands for 30 minutes at a time until after a month of casual effort I began to see something. It was a white transparent layer that traced along my body. From then on I would stare long enough until a dark blue color would emerge from my body.

Around this time I also began to see what I can describe as ""mist"" floating in the air. If you were to look at a room

I'd like to clarify that I've never done drugs/have a mental illness/ or some medical eye problem. 

1. Sparkles- A twinkle that is normally seen on a clear sky but can be seen in dark lit rooms. Usually just a split second long but can sometimes trail along slowly for a full second ( one time it traveled the length of my left arm). Appearance can be described as throwing glitter into the air and watching it ""sparkle"". I also call them rainbow ants as they seem to shift between a multitude of colors while I see them.

2. Sand/Mist waves- Waves that can be seen in the air?space. They have a transparent appearance that moves rhythmically in fast or slow waves. I describe it as seeing the energy of objects around me or the particles present in the air. Can be seen clearly against back backgrounds and will persist for as long as my vision is steady.

3. Rainbow Blob- Started seeing them around 9/?/10. I describe it as seeing a Photoshop grunge brush that is both rainbow in color but transparent. I see it usually along with repeating numbers on the clock etc. I have a feeling they are them embodiments of good spirits.

4. Clouds- Are a thicker variation of mist waves. They move fast and with purpose. I think it's a spirit. It can vary in size from a shoe box to 4ft high (so far as Ive seen anyway). Are also fleeting in duration

5. Orbs- Fast little things I see dashing around the room. Haven't seen them outside yet. Are colorless and very quick.

6. Shimmer- Sometimes when I stare intently at an area it will shimmer. Like a portal in the movies or gas that slightly distorts the focus. Feels like it's the veil of reality or maybe a peek into the next dimension.

7. Blue Dot- Will see a blue dot where my third eye would be when I close my eyes. 

I'd like to add that I'd had one unsuccessful but very close OBE and one very short lucid dream which I thankfully recorded :) Umm oh I sometimes get the instinct to look at my watch or at certain cars' license plates and I'll see 222 12:12 12:34 etc I can also tell time accurately without looking at a clock and have felt tingly sensations when contacting spirits and sometimes intuitively know of other people's distress.

A little background. My family lives in our own house in what used to be a suburb and is now a small city. We've been here at least 16 years
It must have been a night in October, so there was no 'draft'. Anyway, even with windows and doors open, the doors inside the house have NEVER opened or closed without a human hand assisting.
So I was a little bit tired and decided to go to bed since it was a weeknight. I closed my door, and closed slightly, leaving it only a crack open. Just like that.
Almost immediately I heard a panting sound. Some heavy breathing make its way from the door, along the length of my bed getting closer and closer.


I could hear it closer with each coming second. I heard it to the point where it was right by my face, and the breathing started distancing itself again.


The breathing made its way along the length of my bed, and it closed again, as if being pulled by a vacuum/draft of movement, but the door actually came to a close.

I went to the kitchen to get my girlfriend a snack and myself a drink. I felt really odd, so I figured it was my girlfriend; they kept coming and stopped right behind me and I waited for arms to wrap around my waist...then they started to recede back to where they had come from. I turned around and no one was there as I took the food and walked into my room. I asked her if she had moved or heard anything. She hadn't.


9-9-2011 - 2:00am:


I stood up and went to go hop in the bath. Me and my girlfriend were having an altercation and it wasn't going well for either of us so I decided to take a hot bath to calm down since the fight was stupid anyways. I couldn't stay in the bath for more than 5 minutes until I dried off and walked back in my room. I came upon my girlfriend, crying. I kneeled down and asked her what was wrong, thinking it was from the fight, when she asked where I had gone. I told her I was in the bath, and she told me she had an encounter. She was laying there in my bed when suddenly it felt as though I had punched right above her head on the pillow; she jumped and asked ""me"" what was wrong, and a cold cold voice answered ""you.""

I walked into the bathroom to go brush my teeth and I'm feeling like shit; my head is split open and I just took medicine so that I could sleep from the pain. I came back, my girlfriend is laying on the bed, feverishly beckoning me towards her. I lay down and ask what's wring as she curls into me, and she quickly tells me that a few minutes after I left the room with the door open, a shadow had darted across the wall infront of her. This doesn't make any sense, because there's literally NO light coming from outside the door, and the only light in my room was from my DVR and iPad

1315425935.0,k7y9p,The Man in my Room (Kinda long-ish...),spacepod,25,1,9,"Hey all! This is my first post to r/thetruthishere. I’ve been getting more and more into reading people’s paranormal experiences since I found this subreddit and r/nosleep. I’ve had quite a few encounters myself

Some background:
My parents moved to the country when I was very young. The area where they grew up was now becoming industrialized and my dad, it was used as a bed and breakfast and had quite a number of visitors. The house was midsize compared to the McMansions of today, including two baths, five bedrooms, a reading room, a smoking room, formal dining room, kitchen, and when I visit

I was about 15 or 16 at the time, and a small closet that I stacked full of fabrics and other creative supplies. When moving into this room, I slept on a metal day bed with a trundle underneath. I had slept on that bed frame without any trouble since I was six or seven. A couple of months after moving into this room, I became increasingly depressed. I would sleep for entire days if I wasn’t prodded into leaving the house. On a number of occasions, I would sleep for 20 hours straight. This sleep was most often black and dreamless, which is very odd because I have always been a active and imaginative dreamer. That wasn’t all, though. Batteries wouldn’t last a day in the room. I noticed this after using the family digital camera to take some photos of my artwork. I replaced the batteries with new lithium ones, but these things didn’t really concern me until the man showed up. 

One night, and noticed a part of it seemed like it was covered. This was really odd, because I didn’t have hanging curtains, only a valance at the top. It was a pretty dark night, but the moon had been out, so I could clearly see that something was in my room that hadn’t been when I went to sleep. I couldn’t see all of whatever it was because my closet door had been left ajar and obscured me from seeing all of what was there. At first I had thought it was my older brother who had snuck in to play a nasty trick on me. I quickly realized that it wasn’t. As a whole my family is quite short and this thing was as tall as the door, so maybe six feet? I was really creeped out so I turned over and tried to sleep. Eventually I did.

These visits became nightly. I became used to the tall dark thing that chilled out in my closet. I barely noticed that the shadow was slowly moving its way out. I began to see details of him, but it’s been so long I can’t remember all the details. His eyes were incredibly sad and deep set. He never moved when I saw him. He just stood there, looking sorrowful. It was almost heart wrenching just letting him stay there, but I was cautious and never left my bed while he was standing there. 

About two or three month after the initial visit, I figured I had a bad dream I didn’t remember and kicked my bed frame. Though now thinking about it, it’s highly improbable considering all the pillows and stuffed animals I used to sleep with. Then I started getting them on my arms, big ugly black and blue bruises. I figured it was time to give up the bed frame and rid myself of the bruises. I dismantled the bed frame and moved it to the attic, then set the extra mattress up in another frame to complete the twin set in the guest room. I began sleeping on the trundle which had no frame, just a set of steel rods on wheels. I pushed my mattress at night away from the wall so I couldn’t kick it. The bruises still showed up. Not only that, but they had showed up in places I couldn’t have hit myself. I’ve never been a really flexible person, who is a nurse

 Shortly after my back and neck bruises appeared, I could no longer make out his face. It seemed like a dark void. During the day I even felt vulnerable. Walking home, things scared me much more than usual. I didn’t like to be alone, though I felt suffocated in crowds. I took my lunch at school in the hallway with a few people because being in the cafeteria made me want to vomit. During weekends I refused to go inside except to sleep, but at the same time I grew an intense fear of trees. I know it sounds crazy, but it was almost if the trees would harm me in some way, like as if they were a rabid animal. When I was inside, or being lynched by a mob. Other than the sporadic black outs

This happened consistently for about two or three weeks until I couldn’t take it anymore. During the day, I went into my room, asked him to please leave, and apologized that I couldn’t help him. I poured salt on my windowsill, on the threshold to my closet, and then the threshold to my room. After that, I never saw him again. With time, but nothing as real as what I had when the man was in my room.",t5_2sntx,True
1375796007.0,1jt609,[ME][FAM] A Visit from Aunt Caroline,rockm-sockm,28,4,1,"I should not have to even type this in this forum but here it is anyway:  What I am about to post is 100% true.

I've been lurking in this forum for a while but haven't posted yet because  most of my stories are pretty personal.  Also, but I tend to shut myself to most of them.  Frankly, they freak me out.  The exceptions have been those involving family members who have passed - those are fine and are actually quite comforting.

This encounter happened when I was very young, so she loved coming over to hold me, coo at me, etc.   She was a big fan of baby-me by all accounts.  Aunt Caroline was a very chatty older lady with long, jet black hair.  (My dad's side doesn't go grey much.)  She had a habit of talking so fast and so much that she would run out of breath. When this happened she would pause, inhale, and exhale deeply before continuing.

Aunt Caroline became sick a few years after I was born.  During one of her visits, and one to the Vatican in Rome.    At that time (and maybe still, I don't know) when a priest would prepare for Mass using a set of vestments with a name in it, he would offer a small prayer for the soul of the donor as he prepared for Mass.

Now, so she quickly prepared the first set of vestments to send over with the friend.  It was, naturally, a big pain for her because of her horrible sewing skills, but she got it done so as not to miss out on the delivery potential.  The other set of vestments remained in the closet. And after a short time, she forgot about them.

Not long after that

One morning, mommy.""  Then the following exchange happened:

""The lady?  What lady?""

""The lady!  She comes in through my window.""  

""What does she look like?""

""She has long black hair and a long white dress.  I can see the moon through her.""

""What does she do?""

""She plays with me and gives me a kiss.  Then she sits on your bed and whispers in your ear.""  (At the time

Naturally, ""Did the lady come last night?""  And every day I tell her pretty much the same story.   As she goes about her day, she's wondering who this person is and why she's visiting us.  She consults a priest, friends, etc.  My mom THINKS it might be Aunt Caroline, but she can't imagine why she's not at peace.

Then one day while all this is going on, she gets up, takes them out, performs her mediocre sewing to the best of her ability, and delivers the vestments to the local priest.

That night

""No

1372000463.0,1gwt42,The biker,entelechy1,25,3,3,"Around ten years ago when I was working as a team leader in a contact centre  I was placed on a shift pattern of working 3pm till 11pm. This annoyed me because it meant that the slightest delay meant I missed the last train home and had to get cab. One weekend I was delayed by a system fault in work and had to get a cab home. Furious at the unnecessary expense I called a cab firm.

The drive home was about 5 or 6 miles and involved driving along the old Dock Road. This was the old main road which followed the line of miles of docks and all the entrances to the docks led off it.

After a few miles the driver had to slow down. There was an accident and police and ambulances had brought traffic almost to a standstill. Naturally curious I looked  at the crash site. There were ambulance crews working on a man in distinctive motorcycle leathers. They were bright red and white. Standing looking over them as they worked was a man in identical leathers to the motorcyclist who had crashed. There was no sign of another bike

The next day reading the local paper I saw an article about a motorcyclist who had been killed travelling home from the city centre; alone !

I was surprised but assumed that it must have been a different accident. As I read further details I felt the hair on the back of my neck tingle. It was very obvious that the paper was describing the very same accident I had witnessed the aftermath of. The driver was a motorcycle dispatch rider who was speeding after having been for a drink with friends after work. Was that his spirit or 'Daemon' that I saw standing over his dying body ?

The back side is literally underground, and the front overlooks a huge depression between the hills, ""The Holler,"" as my grandmother used to call it.

Around the same time I had seen my father, like when he visited us.  It was him, as clear as day.  He wasn't spooky or ghostly at all.  He lifted his hand to wave at her, and he was gone.  She has only told me this story once, and she generally won't talk about it.  She was the closest to him of anyone in our family and I believe that is why he appeared to her in such a strong shape.

Perfectly normal. I've had odd things happen before, and were I to be suffering with something

I've had an exceedingly paranormally active day

First things first, nothing. Utter dead silence, when suddenly I hear tiny whispers from a few feet away. The voices become more distinct, and I recognize them to be female. They giggle and talk for a while, and I try my best to ignore it. I was late, and didn't have time to deal with it.

Driving to school I was panicked because I had about 8 minutes to do a 15 minute journey. However, and I hadn't misread the clock, due to my double checking in disbelief of how late I really was. (This ones more /r/Glitch but oh well.)

Everything was normal and dull at school, and were allowed to do whatever as long as there was complete silence. The teacher's not one to let someone off without a detention, so everyone was abiding by the rule. Suddenly, I heard the whispering again. Closer this time. I looked around, no one was talking, no one had moved. The same voices, it sounded like. Giggling and talking. 

About ten minutes after this

I jumped at the disruption of the quiet, or some sort of entity said it. It made no sense to my thought pattern of the time. 

Later on I was returning from lunch, and I was expecting to struggle with the door, considering that the winds direction should have been blowing it shut. No sooner had a laid a hand on the bar that the door swung open, gently. I walked through, and it closed just as gently behind me, rather than being slammed closed by the wind. A guy I don't know was standing in the courtyard staring at me, and asked: ""How'd you do that?""
I just shrugged

Lastly, and turned the light on. Still the outline of her form and the feeling she gave lingered. I was freaked out, and told my boyfriend. He said I'd described his fathers mother, who I hadn't known. Nor had I known she was passed.

So she's in her room, strong enough that it knocked over and shattered a champagne glass from her parents' wedding off the shelf on the wall. She stopped and stood still, listening to see if it was someone breaking into the house. The thud happened again. She locked her room and phoned her parents and they were apparently still out for the day. 

Another thing happened while I was actually there. We were in her room watching television, but even that was kind of unnerving considering the fucking printer was off the whole time (at least as far as I saw). 

She had told me a bunch of little stories of things that had happened over the years, and hearing her voice being called. From my perspective, I just always felt the slightest unease in certain portions of her house, but nothing really noticeable.

1359051190.0,1779no,[ME] A Midsummer Chill (x-posted from Askreddit),Rauhta,26,2,4,"I thought I'd share my story here

Midsummer's eve, and in order to reach it you had to first leave your car by the road (it was really remote, so this could be done), then walk about 2 km through the woods and finally row a boat across a small river.

When we reached the cottage, so he managed to wiggle his way in through a small window and open the door from inside. We then proceeded to unpack our stuff and got a fire going to warm up the sauna (a must on Midsummer around here). My ex told me we were going to sleep in the first room on the left, the old master bedroom, and I went in to make the bed ready for us. As I entered I was at once hit by a strong feeling of dread: we were not welcome here. I tried to shake it off, because I didn't want to ruin our weekend, and so said nothing about this to my ex.

We decided to have a bite to eat before going to the sauna, so we were both a bit puzzled by this sudden illness. We thought it would be best for him to rest for a while, so we went into the bedroom to lie down. I wasn't thrilled about going in there, but it was the only place with a bed at that time so we really had no choice.

I remember very vividly what happened next. We were lying on the bed; my ex with his eyes closed and breathing heavily, just like before, but this time it kept escalating to the point of pure fear. My heart was pounding faster and faster as I realized we were in the middle of nowhere, we had no phone, and my ex was the only one of us who could even drive. Then I saw it in the doorway.

A shadowy figure, radiating hate. It seemed reluctant to step all the way in, but made sure I knew if it chose to do so, it could. There was no other way out of the room except though the window, but that was sealed shut. I mustered all of my strength, shook my ex by the shoulder and explained to him that we had to leave NOW. He was still very weak, but I managed to get him up and packing. The figure was nowhere to be seen; it had vanished when I focused on getting my ex to his feet.

So, and we needed to get back to civilization while he was still able to travel. But what do you know: by the time we had crossed the river he was feeling a lot better, and his fever was all gone before we reached the car. He mentioned something about maybe going back now that he was okay, but I quickly refused.

We drove back to his parents' house, chatted with his relatives, everything seemed back to normal. So much so that I was starting to doubt myself; had I really even seen something? I must have been overreacting, imagining things. Then my ex's uncle speaks up: ""By the way, did you know the place is haunted?"" I felt my stomach curling up with fear, as if I had swallowed an ice cold stone. He continued: ""Yeah, it really is! I remember my dad telling me about it. He said that even before he was born there were strange things happening down there all the time, he said he had re-conducted the energy flows around the property so that the house would from now on be left untouched by evil, I just sat there feeling sick to my core. I didn't dare to ask more details about this claimed entity

Never went back to the cottage. Never saw of felt anything like that again.

I have 2 sisters
One day I visited my ""younger"" sister and we talked about dead people contacing their loved ones. Then she told me a lot of things which happened to my oldest sister. Unfortunately she lost her Child, before the operation he was playing, he was happy and worried about nothing. At that moment no one would have thought that he would left us forever.  There were complications and so he bled to death...

It was her second child
That was now the background story.

After his death a few things happened to her. She and her husband made a CD with all the favorite songs of her son. They knew that there was one song missing, to think about the old times, maybe laughing about the good times with their child. Then after the CD was over, they turned the radio on and they were really surprised because exactly at that moment they've played that song who was still missing on the CD. Maybe it was a message or just coincidence. 

Well then there was another story. My sister became pregnant and bore a new son. When he was 1, which a child can play with to learn spelling, well he was playing with them for a while and then my sister came into the room and was shoked when she read the name of her dead child on the bottom. She could not explain that happening to herself, because she never really told his name to her newborn so he could not know his name anyway. 

Since that day, but those happenings helped her a lot through her depression. And I think that is really the most important.

---------------------------------------

Back in September of 2008 my best friend Ciera (pronounced Sierra) and I went to a park named Hocking Hills in the American state of Ohio for a day retreat from our busy lives. We had decided on this at random when we first got together early in the morning just after sunrise; it was a nice warm late summer day and we'd just got the wild notion to go for a drive to Hocking Hills since the area is well known for its several walking trails

We started down a trail at random and found that part of the trail had been washed out so we had to take another path which according to our phone’s GPS tool would force us to cross a small country road.  As we played with our mobile phones and noted it was roughly 12:00noon EST we happened to be passed by a group of backpackers before we reached the road and one of the people turned around to warn us to be aware of a wash out up ahead if we were going to take the trail into the woods

As we crossed the road to the tower trail we noticed there was caution tape all over the fire tower, grimy, and there were flies all over the area. We walked past it, commenting how odd it was, and continued down the trail we had been recommend to take, but it was one neither of us had noticed before on a previous walk to the area. This trail took us past the fire tower and then cut into the woodlands; as we walked into the forest maybe 1500 feet / 457 meters or so we took notice that no one seemed to be around and in fact not only did we feel isolated from others but we felt very chilled without explanation. Ciera pointed it out verbally while I was thinking it, but we just continued walking. Eventually the air started to get noticeably chillier and damper. This did not seem unusual at first but as we continued to walk the air seemed to go from warm to what felt like the mid-50’s Fahrenheit   / 10’s  Celsius  and we started to shiver.

It was also getting darker as we continued forward; at first I thought it was just due to the green leaves on the trees and maybe a passing cloud over head but the darkness really did not improve as one expected.  As we walked we looked around and there were nothing but trees on all sides, the battery was also near dead, and showed ""EE:EE"" for the time (meaning it couldn't update as it was an older style flip-phone with camera and when set to auto-adjust would contact the mobile phone network every 15 min).

It was only then as the light grew dimmer that I noticed the area seemed very silent, grass, twigs, and our breathing just echoed. Ciera got spooked and I did too, she mentioned it was very out of the ordinary and I agreed but I couldn't shake this sense of foreboding that something was amiss. I tried to rationalize it but I really, honestly, couldn't figure any of it out at all.

We just pressed onwards and after going down a small hill and back up it seemed to have gotten a lot darker. The world seemed to have gone from just shadowy to near twilight darkness. My friend grabbed my arm and started freaking out about how weird it got - then the air seemed to have gone still and we had a feeling of something wrong. We both took off running looking for an exit

Then ahead of us down another small dip in the trail we could see two large honeysuckle bushes on either side of the trail like a gate. We made a mad dash for these bushes and just as we pushed through the plants something odd happened - we were over whelmed by a change in our surroundings as light, empty, and dark building to a warm busy street. We stood at the edge of a place known as Ash Cave which has a large water fall not too far away with a u-shaped cliff. I turned around to look back from where we emerged and while the bushes were the same the area was so different, brighter, not silent for sure, and warm. In fact our skin was cold to touch which just reinforced the facts. We took out our phones and the time had finally updated, it was now 4pm. The normal trail would only have taken an hour to walk fully so it was a loss of three full hours!

Logic attempted to set in and we decided the trail we came up must have just appeared creepy because there may have been clouds over head or a storm blew by but when we went back between the bushes there was no trail. Nothing looked like it had a few seconds ago. Ciera walked around the bushes twice and it was the same bright sunny day with no darkness and no trail. We waited

On returning to the normal trail with the wash out we ended up locating an off shoot path which took us back past the fire tower. It was here we noticed it was normal looking  as the windows were not taped and very clean, she didn't find that funny of course but either way we both felt we should share this with you and if anyone out there has had a similar experience perhaps they can provide insight or share their own.

Edit: Ciera corrected me on the name of the cave we came out at

I've been in the Army for just over 7 years now. During this time I have spent just over 2 1/2..2 3/4 years in Iraq doing various missions, all this started back during my first deployment. My family has a long, proud, history of military service. There has been someone from my family serving in every major, and minor, conflict the United States (and the colonies) have been in as well as conflicts spanning back to Europe before we came over here. I had always heard stories of the demons soldiers bring back from war (figuratively of course, not ACTUAL demons) and part of me attributes this to my PTSD. My first major engagement occurred back in early 2006. We had been in country for several months at this point. During this time Iraq was a much more violent place than it is now. In fact it's argued that it was more violent then, I would say around midnight, a house. Since that night I have had this feeling of a presence near me, out of the corner of my eyesight
My girlfriend has always been a perceptive person. When we first started dating she was climbing into my truck one day, not so much saying as projecting, that he was sorry for something. When I was in that engagement the building I had blew up, so this struck me as some sort of connection, maybe this burnt man was the same one I had seen in my dreams and in the corners of my vision.

 Alright so I guess I'll start at the one that was the most meaningful to me. Back in 2011 I was living in Oklahoma at time (I have moved around a lot and so will these stories.) and I had gotten a call from an old friend back in Indiana telling me that my ex whom I was really close to had passed away while getting a blood clot removed. It was a really hard for me as I had been living in Oklahoma with no friends or family so it was a pretty bad time for me and suffering from severe depression from a lot of things at the time this didn't help at all. Well I want to say that night I was sitting in my bed crying my eyes out and just listening to music when the song Over and Out from Alkaline trio comes on and if any of you aren't familiar with the song the first lines says ""Over and out, hell I would have too but she was a huge Alkaline Trio fan and she made me fall in love with that band again after I had forgotten about them. Our song was even an Alkaline Trio song so I felt it was her way of saying goodbye to me. She had suffered from mental issues and always talked about how living made her suffer I felt like it was her saying that she's all better now as well. I had another encounter with her energy as well almost a year ago. She came to me in a dream and said she's sorry she didn't say goodbye, but then again that could have just been me. 

Alright let's jump into stories from my childhood. I wanna say when I was about five or six we lived in a apartment in Indiana and I remember every night when I'd try to fall asleep I would here then legos in my tub moving around like someone stick their had in the tub and spun their hand around. Also I use to have a long shadow person watch over me while I slept whenever I ran into my parents bedroom to sleep. After much thought I feel like it could have been my mom's father who always wanted a grand kid but sadly passed away before he had one. It's just a theory all I know is it use to scare me shitless when I was younger. I also use to suffer from sleep paralysis when I was younger as well. I can still remember the dream vividly I had a hag and everything. Alright this next one isn't too paranormal but it freaked me out nonetheless.

 I was living in Saginaw

Alright now stories of my family the only one I can really think of is the one involving my great grandmother Mimi. I wasn't there when it happened sadly

 Alright now time for the last stretch my friends. I have about three short stories. The first one involves my friend since grade school who lives in a old train stop dating back to the late 1800's. He says he's seen someone walking down his hallway and he hears doors slam every so often I have yet to experience any of it and I don't think I will because his city is sadly bulldozing his house to make it a parking lot.
 Now this one is about an old friend who use to take the trail through the graveyard to school everyday and he use to tell me he would see a green ball of light fly over a few graves ever morning and one time he saw what he described as a cloud hanging over a tombstone.

 Now for the final one that I did get to experience. Back in Michigan I had a neighbor who owned a house that was about one hundred years old. (The whole block was like that honestly, so we went to the side of the house where the door was and it was locked so I unlocked it and went through clearing and checking all the rooms, not a damn thing in there. Supposedly they also saw a little girl in the upstairs apartment and the kitchen light turning on.
 There I'm done. Sorry for this wall of text and the time of your life you won't get back. I sadly have a few more stories but I need to talk to my lady about them before I share them.

I was in a choir, even slamming my body against it. Nothing. So a little weirded out I went over to the next stall. Exact same thing. Again I slammed into it and failed to open it. Eventually I gave up and shrugged it off and moved to the last stall which was open. After I was done I was just about to unlock my stall when I heard the distinct sound of the lock sliding from one of the other stalls. I froze for a minute hoping that someone had come in while I was using the bathroom or that I was hearing things. I opened my stall and saw no one and both of the doors to the two other stalls still closed. I felt really uneasy and started washing my hands. I was looking in the mirrors and in the reflection to my horror the door to stall number one (which had been locked) was opening. I'm not talking about a slight push from a breeze (0f which there was none) or the bounce a door does after you open/close it. This was full on opening so I could see the entire inside of the stall. I just stood there not knowing what to do. Then the door started to close just as slowly.

1343099606.0,x1xsg,[FR] Choose Your Friends Wisely,DecimateTheWeak,28,5,8,"(Back story) - I started working a job and at every start of a shift we drew cards to see what station we’ll be working at, but when I asked my question she straight up froze in her spot. She slowly looked at me and asked me why I would ask that. I told her I was just curious if you believe in it or not. She leaves and comes back about 10 min later visibly distraught. Feeling terrible I apologize to her and told her to forget about it. She tells me its fine and asks if I still want to know. I say only if you’re comfortable answering it. She proceeds to tell me about her unique experience with a group of so called “friends” and what she thinks was a demon.

(Her account) – Amber at this point is just happily married and life is going extremely well. Her brother has been trying to invite her to come over and hang out with his new friends but she’s been reluctant since she’s been told they’re not the best people to hang out with. Finally she caves and goes over to chill. She has a good time with everyone and starts to hang out with them more often. The more she goes over the more excited her new friends get. One person in particular, we’ll go with Jenny, takes a personal interest in Amber. They start playing card games, but Amber tells me that only Gary was allowed to deal the deck, and the cards was a normal deck of cards but with markings on them that have been drawn on with a marker. Markings she’s never seen but didn’t really get concerned about it. She said she never understood any of the games they played, but they were drinking having a good time and wasn’t to worried about it. Then Gary asked for her necklace and took the cross off it and replaced it with a trinket of some kind and said it was his gift to her. Eventually Gary and Jenny had Amber reading from a book to help them study for a class they were taking about a mythology (at least that’s what they told her) and it was easier for them to grasp the concept if she read these passages to them while they took notes. 

Soon after that Amber’s life takes a huge slide downward. Her marriage starts to crumble she becomes mean and spiteful towards her husband to the point on physical violence, I made sure to ask that while she was telling me this). She stops going over to hang with Gary and Jenny as requested by her husband. Eventually her husband leaves saying they need some time apart. A week or so later Gary calls frantic saying that he’s sorry and the he has opened a door and it needs to close it. Amber, pissed off at the world, doesn’t respond to the messages. Then Gary shows up at her door pleading her to just take a 10 minute drive he’ll explain everything and that’s he desperately needs to undo what he did. Amber finally gives in and agrees because she’s curious what he has to say.

Apparently, from the card games to reading from the “text book” as an experiment. They were too big of cowards to do it to themselves so they targeted someone they didn’t really know. They invited something into her and it decided to stay. The whole car ride Gary is apologizing and saying he didn’t know that it was going to be this serious. He said that he must close the “door” and hopefully they could undo the damage done. She argues with him and refuses then she starts seeing the figures while they’re driving dodging across the windshield. She pulls the car over and starts yelling at Gary even more when Gary starts mumbling something then grabs her leg and digs his fingers into her thigh. Amber got instantly quite and she said that when Gary grabbed her leg he let out the most guttural yet highest pitched scream she’s ever heard come from a human being. She says it was the most frightening sound she’s ever heard, and couldn’t believe that a human was even able to emit such a sound. Things got eerily quite and she said Gary looked physically exhausted, like he just got done running a marathon. Gary looked at her and said that it was done and she should be safe.

Things did get better her husband at the time was still upset and reluctant to go back but they were technically still married and were trying to work it out (unsure of what happen later we all got laid off from our jobs and I never really got to see her again.) Her family noticed an immediate difference in her attitude and she went to a rehab for the drugs and she found a job

I do try to debunk it because I try to be logical

When he looked through the door, in an almost inhuman display of strength, she grabbed the toilet out of the ground, threw it, and then passed out.

1339097933.0,uq9sd,Demon Dogs,annuvin,30,7,15,"I wish to preface this by saying this was the single most terrifying incident of my life.  It occured in the same wooded location as the encounter with [Creepy Chick](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/qyx09/creepy_chick_xpost_from_rnosleep/).  I originally posted it on Obiwan's UFO-Free Paranormal Page, moose

Back when I was in high school

I had just got my first car and was driving around with my friend ""Spam"".  After getting bored of driving aimlessly with nothing to do, we found it... gone.  Literally as if it had never existed.  I assumed we came to the wrong area and set off to try and locate it.  We turned north on Salem Road and eventually came to the ""new"" graveyard that the pioneer graves were allegedly moved to.  We parked the car and started exploring the gaveyard.  

After a while, so make sure nobody is around to catch [us].""  At the time, we were approximately 20 yards from the car, and the graveyard sloped down away from us.  I could clearly see down Salem's Road both to the north and the south where we drove up from.  I glanced both ways and turned to see what the hell Spam was up to.  I looked down and Spam had a tire iron and was attempting to pry up a footstone from the gave e stopped in front of.  I just had enough time to process what he was doing and let out a ""what the fuck are you doing?"" before we heard a voice behind us as ""Can I help you boys with something?""

I spun around to see an old man that looked in his 70's standing not 10 feet from us, I stammered out a ""no man, we're just looking around"" as Spam tried to covertly stuff the tire iron into his pants.  Nervously, I asked if he was the caretaker of the graveyard.

The man replied, got in his truck and drove south down Salem Road.  

""WTF did that mean?"" asked Spam.  Neither of us had a clue what ""board"" the old guy could be a part of, and was leaning against the tailgate, facing us, with a stern look and his arms crossed.  I slammed on the brakes and sat there watching him watch us for a minute before putting the car in reverse and driving back the way we came.

We pondered the creepiness of the old guy as we drove the long way around back to where the entrance to the 'Lot used to be.  I parked the car over where I was sure the gravel road used to be and got out.  Spam grabbed a bag out of the back of the car that had a knife and a dime-store copy of the Simon Necronomicon in it.  We started off into the woods walking between two rows of cedar trees that skirted a farmer's field on our left.  Eventually, I couldn't understand how the road that we used to drive in on had quite literally disappeared in the two or three years since the last time I was there.

Suddenly Spam got another bright idea that was apparently inspired by the arcane symbols we saw painted on the trees on the way in.  Pulling out the Necronomicon, he called me over to see something.

Two or three inches in the ground, but as the sun set we had quite a hole dug.  At that point, we lit two fires on either side of the hole so we could better see what we were doing.  However as the sun set, we were having a hard time seeing anything.  I have no idea what possessed us so badly to dig that hole, but I suddenly stopped and suggested going home to get a shovel and a flashlight.  Spam agreed and we started throwing dirt from the hole on the fires we had lit so we could see.

Suddenly as the last bit of fire was extinguished, it went from soundling like it was a half-mile away to sounding like it was 50 feet away and closing fast.  The barking/snarling had another quality about it like what a loose fanbelt sounds like in winter, but more of a squealing like something being torn to pieces that refused to die.  By now this hellish racket was louder than any concert I have ever attended (and yes, I saw the Ramones live when they were together).  Terrified, I turned to Spam and screamed ""what the fuck is that?"", but I was unable to hear my own voice over the deafening cacophony.  Spam looked at me with a face as white as a ghost, turned and fled back down the path the way we came.

The next thing I remember was being in the pitch black, I unlocked Spam's door, started the car and flipped the headlight switch.  Nothing happened.  For whatever reason, the headlights simply didn't work.  I put the car in drive and floored it out of there anyways.  After we got about 50 yards down the road, the headlights came on by themselves.  I drove for about 20 minutes, pulled the car over and asked Spam ""what the hell just happened?""

We never did find out what came after us that night, and shook the very foundation of my belief system. You can choose to disbelieve my account, but I know what I experienced in the 'Lot that night and it was not some junkyard dog or random coyote pack.

First, I often wonder if my childhood left me more “open” to certain things. A conversation better left for another time…

The most frightening experience I ever had was when I was around 12 years old (I think) and my step-father and I were travelling through a very remote area of Montana. I will not name the town
Anyway, the one-story kind with all the rooms in a row connected to one another. There was only one other car in the parking lot, the one next to our room.

I remember there not being anyplace to eat, we were just outside of Glacier where that story takes place). We eventually turned in early.

I have suffered from insomnia pretty much my whole life, etc. Around 3:00 a.m. I heard sounds outside the bathroom window. The tiny bathroom was right next to my bed and it had one of those small rectangular frosted glass windows high up on the wall. The sounds were what my mind characterized as footsteps. Two sets of them. They stopped outside the bathroom window and I proceeded to hear low whispers. I could not make out what the words were. Then, I hear these low moaning sounds. These started out quietly, but rose in both volume and ferocity. After about three minutes, they were so loud, I was looking over at my step-father’s bed wondering why he was not waking up. Suddenly, the moans changed into snarling and growling. I lay in my bed, trying to rationalize what I was hearing. Then I heard blood curdling screams coming from the next room. These noises were actually coming through the wall next to my head. There was some tearing sounds
The next morning, it was one of those television moments where everyone literally stops and stares at you. I was very creeped out. We ordered scones and coffee. I remember it being my first scone and it was delicious. However, my step-father finally caught the vibe from the locals and we noped the fuck out of there as soon as our order came.

I told this story to a friend a few years ago after he mentioned that exact same town in conversation. He had lived in another town about 30 miles away. He told me the town was kind of like a joke to locals in that area because everyone found it very creepy and just “off.” He told me the town was made-up of all one family and they had all emigrated from Eastern Europe. I do not know what happened and I do not know what it means.

1327894202.0,p2i9i,[ME] I found it in the mountains,rustymoose,29,7,15,"I decided to post my experience here because I thought it would be taken more seriously. Honestly

I used to do a lot of hiking and mountain biking near my house before I went to college. It is mountainous, and then hid them and continued on foot, as our goal was a small canyon we had seen with binoculars. Now, we RARELY see other people up there and we would go a lot, so we knew the terrain very well and kind of had a feeling for the area. We continued on and entered the mouth of the canyon, and at this point the foot trail ended and we had to climb over rocks and kind of figure out our own trail. It was not that hard and I have made the same trip many times since. We hiked for about 30 minutes until the canyon abruptly ended in a V, with sheer rock walls on either side. We decided to take a breather and drink some water and look around. It was about 5:30pm so that left about another 45 minutes, until the sun started to set. We were about to leave when I noticed the remnants of a fire ring, while there was not any live grass around in the immediate area. Also

I have never seen any more dolls up there, nothing happened to him, but to this day I have never found out where that came from (I don't know how I would've), nor have I seen another one or any people up in that canyon. I will say that high rock walls on either side of you will give you the feeling of being watched...

1324648485.0,nnwyp,(Me)Catholic Church at night,Yankeehero,26,2,5,"This is the only story I have

This Catholic Church had a K-8th grade school attached, and voices that they attributed to the old monseigneur, who had died some years previously. My mom ran the computer lab in this building, and while we were in the room the lights would turn off. My mom would tell the class that the lights were broken, but we both knew that the switches were actually flicking off. I heard somewhere that power surges can make a switch flick on its own, does anyone know if this is true?

Anyway, another adult, my best friend, and another kid stayed the night in my dads tent trailer to protect the stuff.

Beside the potentially paranormal part

On one of these patrols I looked through the window on the entrance door of the k-2nd grade building and in through the classroom door window of the kindergarten class ([like so](http://i.imgur.com/Nk766.png)) to see [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?start=75&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS379US379&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=713&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=f7zwSl2CcISj8M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.cakitches.com/books/anatomy-dummy.html&amp;docid=QzYvGugJ3kJbZM&amp;itg=1&amp;imgurl=http://www.fotosearch.com/bthumb/ESP/ESP005/0628-200977-01.jpg&amp;w=130&amp;h=170&amp;ei=-oX0TvH1IeGYiAKpzYzJDg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=263&amp;sig=103950982935379469201&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=5&amp;tbnh=136&amp;tbnw=104&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429, just like that picture.The dummy was facing us perfectly through the two diagonal windows. It was creepy, so I made my friend look. Upon returning from our patrol we looked through the windows once more to find that the dummy had moved. The dummy had turned 45 degrees or so, so that it was now difficult to see it's exposed organs. I told my dad and the other guy and they just kind of dismissed it, as they didn't see it previously. Of course, all of these doors and buildings are completely locked. About an hour later we checked the dummy through the window again and now it was on a completely different table and very difficult to see from our original and only viewpoint. This time even my dad admitted that it had moved. It didn't move again, and we never heard or saw anything else unusual for the rest of the night.

This is a difficult ghost story to tell because of the strange angles and frankly just because it is so *weird.* It doesn't sound cool to tell to people, but nothing ever happens.

It struck me, enough to mention the dream to my little brother.  I was shocked that I remembered the dream and that it impacted me and stuck with me, but that's how it was.

So I went to work and whatnot.  That same evening

I told her she was being irrational.  It wasn't raining or anything

I hopped on the bike, with my headlights on, and illuminated by street lights.  Not speeding.

As I'm reaching the intersection, I swerve out wide to avoid making contact, and suddenly...it happens.

It almost happened in slow motion, my tires locked up causing my bike to fling me forward.  I see the same exact things I saw in my dream/vision.  I watched the speedometer and handlebars slip downwards as I get launched forward.  I was completely at peace during the whole thing, never panicking or fearing.

Next thing I know, chest, stomache, and knees are facing the sky.  I watch the leafless tops of the trees slide into my field of view, directly in front of me.  Suddenly, I come down with a crash, my head thumped (thankfully I had a full face helmet)

It was around mid-late October after dark. I was leaving on my bike from a friends house who lived about a quarter of a mile away from my house. My friend and I were talking about scary movies and in the spirit of halloween I decided to ""challenge"" satan (grew up LDS so Satan and hell were reality as far as I knew at the time) to give me a good scare on my ride home. Pretty retarded thing to do I admit

So on my ride home, other lights down the road where on. It was in all likelyhood a coincidence. Down the street a little more a car backs out of a drive way really fast, stopping just a few feet short of me. A little disconcerting, but eh, probably more of a coincidence than anything. The rest of the ride home is uneventful.

When I arrive home I drag my bike through the garage toward the back yard to park it. This area is dark at night. The house's backyard is pretty big and the fence at the end is a chainlink fence behind which is an alley where our dumpster were. As I park my bike I say

""Come on Satan. That wasn't very scary. You should do something like make a big wolf appear in the alleyway or something.""

Not more than a few seconds after I say this, and stares straight at me. I just sort of stand still, looking back at it, trying to ignore the creeping panic inside me. I turn around and walk into the back door of my house. The back door lead through a short hall that acted as the laundry room which connected to the kitchen. In the kitchen was a window facing out to the backyard. When I look through the window I no longer saw the wolf. Just gone. 

Keep in mind, but I've seen coyotes, and that creature was definitely not a coyote. It was way too big and the colors were all wrong. It was most definitely a wolf.

Since then I've respected the supernatural, and I hope to keep it that way.

Then it hit me that she would have called my name if she had been home. I looked around for a bit, trying to figure out what the noise had been. Where the star is there was a coat rack and I thought that maybe a coat had fallen down, but they were all still there. However
[It looked like this

Being a 9 year old girl who still played dress up and liked pretty things

When I was younger, but they definitely didn't help. Given that I was already supposed to be asleep, I was already sort of on alert as I read my book, as my dad had taken books from me before when he caught me still up. Sometimes though I could hear them coming and hide the book under my pillow and pretend to be asleep. So when I heard what sounded like my sister crying for my mom one night (I live in the south so it was a younger child crying ""Mama!"") I didn't think much of it at all. Until my sister didn't cry out again, and I didn't hear my parents stirring. I can't remember exactly, but I think I might have even tiptoed down the hallway to her room to check on her. My parents had changed her regular door to a dutch door so they could leave the top part open but she couldn't roam around. My sister was still asleep though, and I figured I'd just imagined it.

Then I started seeing things. Not just at night either. I'd be playing solitaire on my bed and see out of the corner of my eye my sister come in the room but I'd look up and no one would be there. (See: the green x for where I'd commonly see the child.) There were many nights I'd be reading and I'd see a woman pass in front of my door and look up

I don't think they scared me. Then again

The man, I asked my mom when my dad would be getting home from work. She got angry at me for not paying attention and snapped that it'd be hours until he got home and why I was asking. I shrugged it off and told her that I was just wondering. 

I wore the necklace to school and such and explained the story to all my fellow schoolmates, I just had to put it in a safe place. 

In the bathroom (B1) we had this little wooden cabinet thing built into the wall beside the toilet, just my mom tidying up and seeing a bag full of what she saw as junk and throwing it away.

I was pretty angry about that though

1365711004.0,1c5o4g,[ME] Recent oddness re: our security system,Red1332,28,8,18,"Having lived in an old house during my childhood filled with the stereotypical shadowed places and its fair share of very strange happenings (a post for another time) so when my husband moved in to our current home I knew immediately it was the polar opposite of that situation; bright all the time with tons of windows and high ceilings

Needless to say

Starting about 2 months ago we've started to have strange things going on with our security system, it was obvious everything had been securely sealed.

Let me also stress this system has only been installed for one year

On another occasion we were awoken by the alarm going off at 2 am

I was willing to write the other stuff off to technical weirdness or the door not being seated properly when locked despite registering that way... until last night.

We were getting ready for bed and my husband went to arm the system for the evening when it started going off. It wouldn't stop going off no matter what he did

The error message on the screen kept scrolling ""system tampered"". We were understandable freaked out, if something was wrong where something wasn't closed it simply wouldn't let you proceed to arm it.

The security system called, not  single one out of place, everything marked as closed and still.

We did the usual

My husband, and double verified the door was locked and couldn't open. We were opening our mouths to laugh at the situation when seven distinct, loud knocks (or footsteps) came from the kitchen directly above us.

We froze

At that point I was more than a little freaked because the loudness and the deliberate timing of knock - pause- knock -pause- for all 7 of those knocks or steps or whatever did not leave us room to imagine that we had heard something. It was something striking wood

Finally deciding there was nothing else to be done, obviously spooked out with his tail and body poofed out and eyes VERY wide. I have not seen him do that for the better part of 8 years, so it was noteworthy. He just doesn't freak out usually.

Neither of us slept very well

This afternoon as I was getting ready for work I was looking for something and poked my head down the basement stairway to see if I'd left it down there. That was when I saw all of the things I had placed on the stairs to take down to the basement in a neat pile at the bottom

So, turning over to get me to scratch his belly, the thing he loves most in life. So I go to the floor to properly bellyrub him, and we spend a while being all /r/awww. I completely fall asleep at the relaxation of it, for maybe less than an hour. Here's where it gets strange.

I wake up, and not wanting to be up all night after having slept all day. I'm lying on my back (my cat had gone to my room to sleep on the bed), and I open my eyes. Directly in my line of sight, above me on the ceiling, the biggest goddamn Spider I have ever seen, in life, in pictures, or in the movies. It had to be 8 or 9 inches across

I jumped straight up, I suffer from arachnophobia, actually I have trouble with anything that has lots of legs or flutters around through the air. This, since I spent some time living in the woods as a child, but that's another story.

I knew before I turned around, I turned to see: nothing. I know it wasn't really there, despite having been literally as clear as day. I live in the north, have all my life, nothing like that lives around here. Even if it was a pet gotten loose, I would have likely seen it again by now, alive or dead of cat attack. 

An optical illusion is just as unlikely. Setting aside the old 'I know what I saw' claim, very close, it couldn't have been in focus. Nonetheless, I've held that as an outside possibility, along with the escaped pet theory, . There is of course also a thin possibility that I simply imagined it. The remnant of a dream, or the vision of emerging madness.

However, who has a different theory. This friend believes that we are in the midst of spiritual forces and entities, as many of you might believe also. His assertion, is that we may occasionally come under attack by malevolent spiritual forces or entities, for various reasons. I'm not one to believe in this sort of thing, but his theory might be argued to have some supporting evidence.

You see, I was also woken under a strange circumstance. In bed at a predawn hour, I awoke for no good reason, probably just habit after getting up on a few hours rest every night that week. I vaguely remember dreaming about my dad, not unusual since he passed away almost a year and a half ago. I lost my mom as a young man, and a brother a couple years before dad, and the dreams were a thing with all of them.

Anyway, not really thinking anything, just waiting to drift off again. Out of nowhere, my father comes walking purposefully into the room, stops at my bedside, and abruptly makes a sweeping gesture with his arms over my body. His motion is so abrupt as to startle me, awake.

I find myself opening my eyes, looking in the same direction, and seeing the same view of the room, sans papa. That was very odd to say the least. And a final detail, I had a decent view of the room, even in that predawn hour, since I sleep with a nightlight on. The reason being, soon after my father passed

It dissipated almost immediately, how does all this tie together? Well, I'm generally an upbeat, even keeled kinda guy, but since I saw that spider, I really haven't felt like myself.

I've been prone to bad moods, cynicism, and even fear. *What if I'm going crazy? What if I'm just fooling myself? What makes me think I can do this? I'll never be one of them. I'll never be able to do this. There's no point in any of it, why do I even bother? I'm probably just insane anyway.* If you subscribe to religion, I believe this is what the Devil wants to tell us.

Some background on this story: Small towns are quiet at night.  This particular small town was situated pretty close to a large Airforce base, but I'm willing to go with any explanation.

A muggy 2 or 3 AM Saturday night in the late summer/early fall (We were in high school, this porch fit the bill as somewhere safe to smoke a joint and bullshit for awhile.  The view was westwards, with a clear view of the sky obstructed only by a few trees on each side.  J was taking a hit from the first joint of the morning, about 3/4th of the way done.  J is not known for passing to the left in a timely fashion, in fact, he's one of those guys that tend to use a roach like a microphone.  Telling some dumbass story between puffs, insuring rapt attention, man

He just stops talking.  Not after a sentence, I feel every hair on my body start to stand on end.  This next part probably took only a few seconds, but it felt like a few minutes.  Slowly my head turned (I was looking at the stars) to look at J.  I can't quite explain how this felt.  Not like something was making me look at things, but like I had to.  Or something.  Can't really put in words.  J and I locked eyes, a look of surprise on his face, and I imagine mine, too.  Slowly my head turned to look at S.  Same thing, locked eyes.  The hair on my arms, we all looked to he sky west, it was moving fast

All of the lights on the street turn on.  Not the street lights, like plugged in appliances came on (like the TV), didn't hear anything, and it happened so fast.  The next second, the whole town goes dark, the only thing audible is a slow winding down 'whirring' sound, the dying of the sound of electric power that's always there

We are all still staring at the sky, everyone should be in bed.  The drivers side door opens and a man we have never seen before gets out.  All the power is still out, but enough of a moon to see almost clearly.  Slowly our heads tilt down to look at this man as he walks around the car to lean against his hood.  Staring at us, us staring at him.  Felt like 5 minutes at least.  None of us can talk.  For however long, he stares at us, and then just gets back in his car.  Starts it and drives down the road.  We can now talk.

""Holy shit, at all?""  ""Who was that guy?""  ""Did you see all the lights turn on?""  ""Let's call the cops.""  ""Why couldn't we talk?""  ""What the fuck?""

As we were trying to collect our thoughts, comes walking up out of the darkness down the street.  ""Thank god you guys are up, Listen:""  ""Holy shit, JL, did you see what just happened?""  ""No, guys seriously, I thought I was about to be kidnapped or raped...""

What?

JL's story was just like ours,) Strong feeling that she had to look to he sky, blue ribbon in the sky.  (At this point in JL telling us what happened to her, the streetlights are coming back on, flickering, but one at a time, not all of them at once.  Also, but randomly.  Like a porch light would flick on at one house, and stares at her.  She can't move or talk.  She can just stare back.  Dude gets back in the car after an indeterminable amount of time and drives off.  The thing is, walk JL home

That Monday in school, except the were in the middle of the 'golf course' of our local college.  Pretty much a 4 acre field surrounded by houses on most sides.

But, stops about 10 feet away

We asked the cops about what happened

I tell this story a lot, a friend who is a little older had his own story to tell.  He and another friend were in the downtown area, tripping on the acid, just hanging out.  He said he didn't notice anything weird except a bright blue flash, and all the power going out.

1360701052.0,18eba5,[ME][FAM] The disappearing/reappearing picture of my alternate mother(?).,Jonjonlewis,32,9,9,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit  and I thought I would share a memory that has always haunted me.

In 2005 my Family got our first digital camera.  I was in the ninth grade and was obsessed with it.  I loved the idea that I could take so many pictures and view them back instantly.  I thought it was the coolest thing.

We had the camera for a few months when we took it that Christmas to a family get together in the upstate of South Carolina.  We took many pictures that day but we did not scroll through them until a few days after.  What we saw was disturbing

Halfway through the pictures of the family Christmas party was a picture of a woman that we did not initially recognize.  It looked as though she was talking a “selfie” of herself in a bathroom that we did not recognize.   She was not a member of our family, crystal clear blue eyes, and she had always looked very good for her age.  The lady in the picture seemed to be a demented/older version of my Mother.  The lady in the picture had the same eyes and the same hair but she look gaunt and at least 20 year older.  The lady in the picture had shrunken in eyes, wrinkles and bags everywhere, and looked as if she did age well.  She looked like a version of my Mother if my Mom had never taken care of herself.  She looked like a version of my Mother who had devoted her life to habitual drug use.

We freaked out and next time we had family over we got the camera to show them.  But the picture was gone.  We searched through the entire memory card, we forgot about it.  Until a few weeks after and we were looking through the pictures and it had returned.  Freaked out, we quickly printed the photo out.  The picture continued to disappear and reappear on the card over our time using the card.

I searched all day through old memory cards and my mother dresser to find the picture but came up with nothing.  But it’s still engraved very vividly in my mind.

Anyone else ever heard of anything else like this happening?

It was Friday night and I had just woken up from a dream I did not remember. I tried looking at my clock but I couldn't make out any of the numbers. Generally a common way to recognize lucid dreaming.

I felt the urge to pee so I was going to get up to go to the bathroom when a man with a mustache was kneeling at the side of my bed. I only caught his face which I still remember vividly. He had sullen eyes with bushy white eyebrows. A cumbersome mustache just tipping over his upper lip. The look of a miner from the forties best describes his aura. 

He told me in such haste; ""There's a snake in your bed!"" I literally have never jumped so fast in my life. I was instantly sitting on top of my sheets Indian style trying my best to create a seal while trying to decide what to do with the snake. 

'Was it moving?' 'How did it get there?' 'What the hell am I going to do to get it out?' All these thoughts went through my head as I sat there playing defense. All of a sudden it was just a feeling I had. It's indescribable but I just knew I had finally woken up.

I could finally read the clock. It said 12:07 am. I was wide awake and giggling at my recent experience. As I walked to the bathroom I had that nervous laughter that lead into a fit of good laughter while taking my pee. My little brother asked me the next day when I arrived home from work what was so funny that I needed to laugh about so loudly? 

I used to go through bouts of sleep paralysis as a child and this was as close to physically terrified I had been in quite some time. It honestly scared the living shit out of me for a good minute. 

tl;dr: I woke up and was told there was a snake in my bed by a dream man. I did my best to keep it from getting me until I was fully awake. Good laughter ensued. ",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18a8sy/me_waking_up_from_sleep/

A friend and I were out in the woods hunting all of last weekend, as usual. As I considered getting up I heard something below in the main cabin room. It got louder and sounded like footsteps creaking against the wooden floor. I thought ""is my friend already up?"" but then I noticed his snores not far away. I thought ""is someone else here?"" since this cabin is used by his dad's whole group of friends for hunting, so I sat up to see who it was. No one was there and the footsteps had stopped. I got up, woke my friend up, and we proceeded with our hunting. I mentioned it later and we both just laughed it off.

So after the illness I voluntarily admitted myself to a psych ward. There I was put on medication and while still a bit manic and confused, he told me he felt a terrible restriction in his breathing like he was being choked and felt he was about to die. Enter another person, let's call him Y. A few minutes after X told me this story and we had returned to the main area of the ward Y approached us clearly and visibly shaken. He wanted a word with us. There he explained that he could overhear our conversation, that he had been in the room at the time near his bed but his curtains were drawn so we didn't see him. At the time of X and I's conversation, Y, who suffers from chronic depression was attempting to strangle himself with a cord. He pulled down his jumper to us and showed us the cord mark around his neck. He claimed that he was passing in and out of consciousness, where he could hear X talking about a restriction of breathing and a feeling of being choked and when he was fading he found himself having a lucid experience where he was in a meadow, then I'd love to hear you guys and girls perspective on it.

I'd come the next morning (3 days a week) before he had school, etc). I immediately felt uncomfortable in the apartment, but specifically in Alex's room.

1337477691.0,tvfwj,Looking out of the fireplace,articulatedjunction,27,5,8,"So I'm an atheist and a skeptic.  I love science and don't believe most ghost stories.  I would talk to people who had a ghost experience was never sure if I really trusted them.  Did they really see what they thought?  Now

My wife and I were headed to the Cotswolds, with original wood framed construction and a massive open fireplace.

When we got there, so we lit those along with the stove and had a nice evening.

That night as we were in bed, grown old, and then died in the room we were in - over and over.  Kind of weird.

The next day we went out exploring and came back cold and wet.  My wife went upstairs to change and I went to turn on the fireplace and light the candles to warm up the place.  I lit the fire with the little electronic ignition

Anyway

I swear - and I have never had this kind of experience before - that I could *feel* 500 years of people looking at that spot.  It was like all the evenings and energy, watching the fire, was all focused there.  It was like the ghosts of the people's attention was so long and so intense that it stayed.  I felt like I could see the shadows late nights and kids and elders and generally rough folks.  One edge of the room felt like where the patriarchs would sit with their beer.  The floor was where the kids or the dogs would be.  It was almost like overlapping shadows of them were still there, all with eyes, all looking toward me.

The feeling was really otherworldly.  I was thinking logically - if there is anywhere for energy to be left over, warming to it.  There probably aren't many places on earth that have had that kind of long term focused attention than really old fireplaces.

I was so spooked, the shadow energy.  I turned around in the direction it pointed, toward the fireplace, like my head was drawn there.  It was like magnetism.  Looking at the fire felt ""normal"".  It was only when looking the ""wrong"" direction, out into the room, that I felt like I was challenging the energy of the room.  The whole room had become almost slanted toward that fireplace.

I heard my wife creaking down the stairs.  Being the skeptic that I am, it would really freak her out.  But I felt like I had to be a good scientist and get another data point, just to see if it was all in my head.

When she got down the stairs I'm not even sure if I said, short scream.  Then I started to say, ""never mind"" and she yelped again.  She later said she didn't know why she screamed, but I figure I must have just looked spooked.  So I gave up on asking her to step into the fireplace and told her a little bit of what I saw.

We were both spooked at the place after that, accumulated for too long.  I had always wanted to stay in old buildings or castles - now I felt like sometimes newer places that are *your* space are kind of nice too.

So that's all.  I don't know if it was real.  I do think that it makes a strange kind of sense to have energy like that in a place like that

I would ask

tl;dr - standing in fireplaces and looking out can be hazardous to your mental state.",,t5_2sntx,1337478077.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tvfwj/looking_out_of_the_fireplace/

1332307737.0,r6d85,Summer Night (crosspost with r/nosleep),entropyblues,27,4,0,"I love horror, however

When I was in college, that edges a wide slow moving creek. It was perfect California summer night, hot and muggy punctuated by gentle breaths of cool breeze. 

We were walking along a long stretch of path, a row of oak trees stood side by side with tall thin streetlights, casting the only light around, as it was a new moon. Ahead, we could see two hundred meters of trail, wide pools of orange light broken up by the deep black shadows under the limbs of the oak trees. But the path was flat and straight, so although the areas beneath the trees were inky dark

We were walking in two rows of three, was looking straight ahead when it happened. We were directly beneath a street lamp, and I was looking ahead to the next pool of light, maybe 20 meters ahead, and at the deep shadow beneath the old oak right ahead of us. I had the strange sensation that the shadow was swirling slightly, and I remember feeling equal parts confusion and vertigo. 

In the space between a breath, directly in front of me, 5 or 10 meters away. He was wearing only a pair of white jogging shorts, and white running shoes. He was old, silver unkempt hair on his head and his chest, and his skin was pale. He was looking ahead, seeming not to see us at all. It was such a jarring sensation, that it only registered after another moment that he was making a great deal of noise. Jogging towards us

I was more confused than scared, as the sides were too steep, and there was nothing to hide behind; the trunks of the oaks were several meters up the hillside.

He didn't acknowledge us, the rest of my group parted to the sides and allowed him to pass right between us. He would have collided with us if we did not.

It had only been a second since I first saw him, to watch him go, but my neck refused to turn. At the same time, I could see in the corner of my eyes, my friends were all looking down, wide eyed, also not turning around

Then

I turned around first, casting shadows. And no runner.

No one spoke for nearly a minute. We turned and started walking again

When someone broke the silence, comparing stories of what we had just seen. Only one other person was looking forward, but his story matched mine: He wasn't there, then he was. But we all heard him, the sudden sound, and then the sudden cessation when he vanished, and then nothing behind us. One of us swore up and down that he had seen the man grab his chest

I wanted to go back, I argued. I was out-voted. We walked quickly for the car, and proceeded to go home to get good and drunk. 

The next day, to find a good rational answer. The other were plenty happy to leave it, unspoken, behind us.

I'm still a skeptic. But it stuck with me. 

One of our friends later found work as a forensic investigator in the coroners office, the personal details blocked out with torn scratch paper.

I lived in a dorm building in an area of the city which has supposedly been decimated in the big earthquake. The dorm was brand new and really nice inside (later one of the guards told me the previous building in that spot collapsed in the earthquake and people were killed

One night, who slept on the top bunk, would wake me up with his snoring but I listened and didn't hear him. I opened my eyes to check the clock and saw a young woman with dark hair sitting at the foot of the bed. 

The woman immediately stood up and walked toward the door, but no sound came out. I don't know why, but the impression I got was she was saying something like ""I'm gonna step out for a few minutes but I'll be right back"". 

I was still kind of clueless from having just woke up, as she didn't simply disappear and blink out of sight. It was like she turned into a fine mist and just blew away. At this point I had only been awake for probably 15 seconds and I remember thinking ""I can totally freak out right now, or close my eyes and fall back asleep and deal with this in the morning, when the sun is out."" I closed my eyes, covered my head with my pillow and fell back asleep.

My buddy Liam is a rather worrisome kid, I'm just explaining for character profiling purposes. Liam's parents were out of town for the weekend and he asked if I could stay over at his house for a day or two. I told him I would and asked why he wanted me to. He told me that strange things have been happening in his house and didn't want to be alone. There was an ongoing joke before this event that he had a ghost in his house that liked to screw with him and his friends. We called him ""Jimmy"" and would always make jokes and blame Jimmy for weird things such as objects being moved or strange noises.

Liam told me that his dog has been just sitting and growling facing the dark hallway leading to his parent's room. He told me lights would go on and off and he even said that he heard the sink running in his parents room. So I go over to his house and we have a typical teenager night

It was very dark when I closed the door, or running to his room, I opened it up to complete darkness, no Liam. At this point I NOPE NOPE NOPED right out of the room and knock on Liams door, I woke him up and heard his dog jump off his bed. He was asleep the whole time. I told him what happened and he just said ""Fucking Jimmy"" and threw a pillow on the ground and I fell asleep on his floor. The next morning I told him I wasn't gonna stay at his house that night. 

Anybody have a similar experience? Or an entity that is sort of a joker? I didn't feel like a malicious presence

EVENT 1: OUIJA 1 STRANGE LIGHTS AND DISTINCT SHADOW

Against my will and against all the advice that I took from here on my last visit my brother thought it would be an ingenious idea to craft a Ouija board. This happened during the time I was replying to all the questions in my previous post.

Iit was 2 Wednesdays (12th) ago that myself

I'm willing to write it off as crap but a saw a few things while we did this the first time. Firstly while asking the questions within the first minute I glanced to my left and saw the distinct outline of the Shadow Man. This time I got a better look at him me seems to only be about 4-5 Feet tall and is wearing baggy clothes so it's difficult to say what kind of build. I only saw him for about 3-4 seconds.

Secondly I was facing the television and I was purposely looking to see if I could see anything happening behind me in it's reflection. It's not an LCD screen so this is why I'm able to see reflections. Towards the end of the session I saw what appeared to be lightning spreading itself across the wall above me in the screen along the top. This happened for about 1-2 seconds. We then ended the session. We asked for a name and got VIGM... but I don't think this can be considered relevant because they surface we were gliding on was not smooth. So it could be a number of things. He also said he was not friendly.

EVENT 2: OUIJA 2 WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT

Ouija board again

Nothing else notable happened until after because my brother was being an idiot using the board. Right after we finished about 10-15 minutes later we were all in the hallway. I moved into my room

What they heard was the sliding open of one of the drawers as we replicated the sound. This scared us quite a bit.

EVENT 3: BREATHING NOISES AND TUGGING

My parents are back in the house now at this stage so I thought that everything would go back to normal and that our minds were essentially playing elaborate tricks on us. 

They came back on the Sunday just gone (16th) and this was the first night I was sleeping in my room alone as my gf went back to her house. Each night I've gone to sleep I've heard what sounds like breathing at the back of my neck. I've tried relentlessly to figure out what's making the noise but I can't find anything. It sounds like it's coming off the wall. Shortly after I noticed the breathing I felt a small tug on the duvet towards my back and into my neck. There was no way it could have been me because I was lying perfectly still to try and pinpoint the sound.

I have heard this breathing every night since. And 2 nights ago I felt it pull on my t-shirt above my shoulder. And I have also seen what appears to be the air ""sparking"" one more time since Sunday

EVENT 4: LAST NIGHT

Ok

So in a normal talking voice I asked whatever spirits were in my room to leave. The breathing stopped and I thought it was pretty cool. Next thing I hear this huge bang. Don't worry I know what it is

My brother gets up and ties the dog up in the porch

This absolutely scared the shit out of me. I went and got the dog and brought him to my room straight away and key'd the front door closed. I started getting really freaked out. On top of that the dog was staring blankly at the wall opposite my bed and wasn't responding to my calls. He kept glancing at my room door as if he wanted to go out. I opened the door and let him out to wander in the darkness of the house.

I thought he'd go back to sleep in the living room as he usually does but he kept pottering around, I put him out again thinking he needed to go as he does this sometimes.

1318365288.0,l8p93,Humanoid Cryptid,,22,0,6,"Hey guys

This a relatively short story. It takes place during my uncle's childhood. He lived in a small town which had a campground on a lake near it. His family spent much of their time there during the summer months. When he was about 14-15 he said him and a group of five teens/kids were going back to their campsite for the night after a day at the lake. As they were walking on the trail back a humanoid creature came walking out of the brush and crossed the path. He told me that it was the ugliest thing that he had ever seen. It walked on all fours, ratted hair, and red eyes. He said it looked at them and crossed the path into the woods. The entire group of kids were terrified. Being an enthusiast for cryptozoology, E.T.'s, etc. I immediately thought of the cryptid known as the Dover Demon.

The first thing experienced was the other day my girlfriend came home to find her toothbrush and toothbrush holder laying on the bathroom floor about four feet from the sink. No one had been in or out of the house since I left with the kids that morning. I was the last one in the bathroom and the items were on the sink when I left.
Yesterday morning I woke up (I was the only one awake) went downstairs to use the bathroom after I did so I returned to our bedroom to get ready for work. I went back down approximately 10 minutes later (still the only person awake) and walked into the bathroom to find a small bottle of shampoo sitting vertical in the middle of the floor.
Last night we had all gone to our old place to clean up and returned later that night. My girlfriends son went into the front room where the front door and it was open and unlocked. My girlfriend and I know for a fact that it was locked and closed when we left since we are security freaks. The other odd part is the screen door which you must travel through (it's an enclosed porch) was still locked.
Other odd things include unexplained sounds (and not just house settling sounds) these including knocking
I should point out that her son is 15 and could be labeled as a troubled teen
Another interesting thing is the house was rented to us at a to-good-to-be-true price and the previous tenant moved out three months prior to the end of their lease yet continued to pay rent but also refused to come back and get belongings. Our landlords also asked us about five or six times on whether we were positive that we wanted the place with almost apprehension in their voices.
If these kinds of things are already taking place only a week into our new lives there I am very curious as to what may happen in the coming months. What more should I expect to have happen?

Or should I just enjoy living in a haunted house?",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/l0qhj/odd_happenings_at_my_new_abode_i_need_your_take/

The first place me and my wife lived together was an apartment in a historic cattle town that served as a gateway to the west back in the day. The building our apartment was in was obviously an old house that had been renovated into apartments and quite old. Needless to say there was quite a bit of activity there, shadows moving on their own, and on occasion small balls of light darting in and out of the bedroom closet.

The biggest thing that happened was my wife seeing an apparition. She got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw a child standing in the kitchen. She turned on the light and the kid vanished. I ended up having to sleep next to the bedroom door for a month... Thanks honey

This was the window we would see people walk by

I had frequent dreams of Black Eyed Kids even though it had been years since I had read or even thought of them. It was almost always a little girl, while the young boy just stared.

In one example my wife and I lived in a farm house, disheveled, or even particularly anxious.

The longer I took to open the door the more impatient she got. My hand reached out and touched the handle when suddenly my wife warned me not to open the door. I looked at the children and noticed their eyes

1372612874.0,1hdfkr,[My] house is haunted,tkat13,33,11,13,"Let me start this off by saying that the only reason I feel comfortable writing about this is because I’m not at my house. Currently, I highly doubt it). However

Who are they, but I’m going to tell you everything that I know about them. First, however, I need to give you some background. I live in a little suburban town in CT. It’s actually a really quaint place, quiet and full of trees. The house we live in is the one my mother picked when we moved (my father transferred jobs so we moved like 8 years ago); it was an older house that the previous owners had expanded on.

The new house has two floors, you find yourself in the living room, if you look to your right, there are two doors on the same wall, but on opposite ends. The one on the left leads to the dining room and connecting kitchen, and the one on the right leads to a small hallway that branches off to the laundry room, basement, you’ll see the computer room and adjoining closet, my father’s room, and it’s never really bothered me much. The basement is what bothers me.

I’ve only been down there once, wooden stairs: the type that are just the planks, so there are gaps between each step. If you go all the way down and turn left, you’ll see an empty expanse of a dusty concrete floor, complete with a single draw-string light bulb in the center of the room. Everything is covered in cobwebs and dust. If you look to your immediate right, you’ll see a large mechanism that’s used to heat the house and supply electricity and water. If you go down the steps and take two steps to the right, and stay facing forward, dusty hallway that’s about six yards long with a white door at the end of it. If you go through this door, but it’s still there because wells are apparently very hard to fill completely.

So

The first one seems to be the most harmless. He has never bothered me before, but night seems to be when he’s most active. I’m not the only one of my friends who’s seen him. He tends to like to basically patrol the house, this may seem stupid or clichéd, but he’s pretty much the guardian of the house. Not the people in it, but the house itself. He seems to be indifferent toward my family, maybe a bit curious and slightly watchful, but nothing sinister. Although I also don’t get the feeling he’s a ""good guy"" either. He always appears as a black shadow, or protective, and one of my friends saw him when he had to go back in the house because he forgot his keys

The second, thank God. But my dreams tend to put a face to it, even though I’m not sure if that’s actually what it looks like. All I know is that it crawls on the floor, it doesn’t reach up past my knee, it ""lives"" in the room at the end of the hallway in the basement, and it’s very presence in the house is pure evil. It likes to taunt me, and I’m not the only one who feels it here. At least four people I know have too. The feeling that it’s there, comes and goes though. It’s almost like it’ll lay dormant in the basement for weeks, it’ll sneak up on me and do something awful.
Mainly it likes to stay in the basement, right next to my room. This one terrifies me. I almost want to know what it is, but at the same time I’m terrified of knowing. Something tells me that ignorance is bliss, but at the same time I feel that if I know what it is, I’ll feel less afraid of it.

The entire time that I’ve lived here, and I’d been practicing for a good hour. Suddenly, I heard some movement in the basement. At first, I thought nothing of it, because we have squirrels in the walls and floors. However, within minutes, it turned from a light scratching, this was much

Another incident I experienced recently was in my room. I was asleep, but I shrugged it off and rolled over to go to back to sleep.

When my aunt was a little girl, so it wasn't much of a bother. In fact, she enjoyed it because she got to hang out with her cousins and sisters in one room and bond with them until they'd all fall asleep.

Anyway, he'd lock up the door and go up the stairs to the bedrooms to check each and every one of them if they were safe and sound asleep. My aunt even remembers waking up to him pulling up their blankets one night to make sure they were all comfy and bundled up from the cold. Then, he'd proceed to go to his room and sleep.

He died a month or two after he was diagnosed, that's when my aunt and her sister heard someone counting the planks one night. 

Of course, and the moment they heard the lock and his footsteps on the stairs, they both hid under the blankets and pretended to sleep. No matter how much they remember their uncle being the kindest, most nicest man they knew, a ghost is still a ghost, something that isn't supposed to be on this earth anymore. 

When their door creaked open, even if it was her uncle, still disturbed her more than she could imagine. She couldn't will herself out of the blanket, and instead laid still and waited for him to leave the room. She went on like that until she actually fell asleep.

This street is about two blocks from my house, and I will often take walks up this street just to see if there is anything new going on.

One particular day, the back street was entirely covered in fresh, untouched snow. I took a walk up the back street, putting the first set of footprints in the fresh snow. As I came to the first bend, I found a group of about 15 to 20 stood upright on the ground. These were very ornate vases, all of them unique, and they looked like they could have been worth a decent sum of money. I didn’t touch them but I took a couple of pictures with my old phone. I don’t use this phone anymore, if there is any interest, untouched and for no apparent reason. 

I wound up going to a gym that was around the corner for about an hour, and I showed him the pictures as we walked over, explaining to him why the occurrence was so strange. We got to the back street and I noticed that my footprints were still in the snow from before. As we got to the first turn, I was shocked to find that all of the vases were no longer there. They had completely disappeared. I looked around to see that there were no tire tracks or new footprints other than the ones that I and my friend had made.

I am prepping for an event tomorrow and so I don't have time to walk to the street (it's raining right now anyway). I might go tomorrow. Also, and this happened like two or three years ago). What I can do now is put up some screen captures from Google Maps. Maybe tomorrow I will take a walk down there when there is nicer weather.

Keep in mind, or spooked. I had few encounters with some things I couldn't really explain, and even heard some things but never really react much about it since they didn't appear often and usually disappeared in a blink of an eye.

Our house isn't that big, which is my older sister).

Here's the pic of the house [map](http://imgur.com/cpBHWAX).

The spaces between room to room are pretty small, we have this [pull out bed](http://www.sofaandhome.co.uk/images/shop/more/750x526_1290086031elliotstopover.jpg). She slept on the top bed while I slept on the lower one. We had a guava tree planted in our front yard before it got cut down when we renovated our house).

Onward to the stories.

1) Back then when I was on 2nd or 3rd grade, sometimes my nose just got clogged and it made me hard to breathe, sometimes I'm awaken with no reason at all. One particular night, I'm awaken from my dreamless sleep. Everything was quiet, I could hear my sister slowly breathing on her bed. I was just staring at the ceiling for about 5 minutes before I heard ONE LOUD BANG on the window glass in front of our bed. Our windows are secured with [trellis](http://www.sofaandhome.co.uk/images/shop/more/750x526_1290086031elliotstopover.jpg) (similar like that) and  the bang caused the trellis to vibrate for like 5 seconds (it was that loud, though my parents claimed they didn't hear anything) Weird thing was, the noise wasn't caused by anything like a stone, but when I measured the distance, no animals sound

2) My sister and I were packing for our trip to the beach with my parents and their friends. There used to be a large oval mirror hanged on the wall in our living room. Below the mirror was a side table we used to put framed pictures and some decorations. That night she was putting in her clothes in the bag and when she lifted her head and faced the mirror

3) My mum has a close female friend who is ""tuned"" to those kinds of things. She's able to ""see"" what most people couldn't see. One day, she told my mum that she saw a lady with long black hair and long white dress sitting on the branch of our guava tree. According to her, we need not to worry since she's harmless and didn't do anything but sitting there. To even think about it still gets me chills. &gt;_&gt;

4) In the map above I circled 2 TVs with red ink. One TV was in the living room, which was gone in a second after. She was in her early teenage years, which was around 13 or 14 and I was still 8 or 9 years old. A year after, my mum picked me up from school and we went through the front door which basically is the entrance to the living room. She went in first, and head straight to her room. I was still on the living room when I saw her turned on her bedroom light and I saw a white smoke floating from the broken TV. I pointed my finger to it and told my mum that there was a white smoke floating above the TV beside her. She turned her head to see, and the smoke's gone. Keep in mind, the TV's broken

5) Later in my high school years, on and off, creaking sound of the wardrobe door at the 2nd floor, and another switch noises at the backyard where our water pump is. When I was alone in the house I often heard things on the 2nd floor, the same creaking and light switch being flipped and other stuffs but my reaction was too nonchalant. I chose to ignored it so it stopped. So what? It was just noises, much better than actually seeing the real thing, right? &gt;.&lt;

 So a long time ago my grandfather bought a house for him, packages opening, items moving, nothing major. But after a while my grandmother realized this wasn't just misplacement and forgetting that they did it, it was something more, something unnatural. 

The day she found out it wasn't them it was a new roommate or at least one they didn't know was there until then. it was in what we call the front bedroom

 As I was saying, she was the only one in the house, kids at school grandfather at work. She pondered what it could have been and then left the room to check on the coffee, when she got to the kitchen it seemed darker all the lights were on, but it was almost like by having so many lights on the power was being scattered across too many areas, dimming everything in the process. The coffee grounds were spilled across the table and a giant H was pressed into the center of the grounds. My grandma freaking out ran into the front bedroom and noticed the blinds were back in their packaging wrapped but now sitting on the floor. 

Later on they found out a lady had passed away in the front bedroom, but they have learned to live with their new found friend and its kinda funny going over there to see things happen.

In school one day (4th grade), I had the OOBE, and I was no longer seeing through my eyes; I could see myself as if I were looking from a foot in front of myself. I could see myself with my hand up and all of my classmates behind me, none of whom had their hands up (nobody else liked the orange juice; the cool drink to get was this iced tea that tasted like balls.) The OOBE lasted about five to seven seconds, and I kept my hand raised stiffly the entire time. People started looking at me strangely because I had my hand up way too long, and I finally snapped out of it and sat back in my seat.

I remember I would get OOBEs while playing video games often. I would get somewhat annoyed and have to pause the game, and I had an OOBE. We were sitting next to each other on the floor in front of the TV, and my vision was coming from about two or three feet behind us, looking at our backs. I paused the game to ask Rich to move over because he was in the way of the screen. I remember him being very confused and told me to unpause the game. I told him again to move over, and he got annoyed and told me to cut it out. After he said that, the OOBE ended. I remember being annoyed and saying ""Nevermind, it's regular, and I can only imagine how confused my brother must have been when this happened.

The best OOBE story I have, honestly), but they were already about a block ahead of me and I wanted to catch up with them. I decided to just run across the street. This big black car was turning and had to slam on its brakes to not hit me. As soon as I started running, I had the OOBE, and I was looking at the whole intersection from an aerial view, maybe two stories above me looking down. I saw myself running, the car stopping, and then I continued to run to catch up with my friends.

I have had hundreds of these experiences, though. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the OOBEs that I do remember. I have no explanation for why I had them so frequently. I have not had an OOBE since I was in fifth grade. When I was in about sixth grade, I started researching about cryptozoology, ghosts, and other paranormal phenomenon, as it became a topic of interest for me for whatever reason. It was at this point that I realized that OOBEs were considered a paranormal phenomenon. After reading about them extensively, I came to the conclusion that this was what I had been experiencing during my childhood. I was surprised to learn that this was not considered normal.

Since about 2006/2007 I've been feeling a weight in my shoulder or back. It kind of feels like a hand but without distinct fingers or a thumb
Around the end of the first semester of 06/07 I was talking to a few friends about ghosts and the paranormal who claimed they have had experiences and to somewhat be knowledgful of the paranormal. That night, I fell asleep on the couch and had woken up to being pulled off by the unseen, with hand marks on my side and I fell on the floor. I knew it couldn't have been the old man because I've fallen asleep on the couch many times before while being home alone. Also, I would go up the stairs which lead to the kitchen and right there is a widow. The house across from my backyard was an acre away and their window didn't line up with mine but whenever I would go up the stairs I would always feel somebody watching me even when someone else was in the kitchen. In that house I slept in the basement and my room was beside the driveway and all up 2 feet was underground. Through that wall, I would feel people tugging at my blanket and clothes and at the end of my bed that was against that wall, I would be able to feel people watching me but nobody was ever there. I've only told 3 people about this and one said the weight on my body and the feeling of being watched (both of which still happens even to this day) said it could be a guardian angel.
Even to this day, while I was typing this, I felt that same weight or pressure on my shoulder and got a headache and I now live 8 hours away from where it started. Is there anything that could be causing this? Could it be a guardian angel?

Edit: I think I might have confused a few people and I need to clarify a thing or two. The tugging only followed me to a second house but it was only about a 10 minute drive between the two houses. After the second house, I will find myself a priest right away. I've heard stories of malovent beings and that stuff is scary. ",,False,,t5_2sntx,1356480706.0,,

For the sake of description both side of my family lived 800km from us in small mostly farming communities and my uncles were literally my grandparents neighbors. Like the title says they stayed close.

Everything started when I was 14. My grandfather passed away. He was a farmer until the end and people (and his animals) loved and respected him. His passing was not sudden and he spent several days at a hospital away from his home. My mother and her brothers where in the hospital for the end while my aunts where still at their home. After they recovered from the shock my uncle called his wife to tell her the news. She didn't sound surprised and asked if it happened an hour ago. ""How did you know?"" ""An hour ago your father's cows started mooing like crazy. I never heard them being so loud."" It sounded a bit crazy but I didn't think much about it.

A couple of weeks after that I came back home from school and I found my mom being pretty quiet. Turned out she was going through some of her father's old box full of letters and poems when suddenly the can of juice she put aside to thaw exploded. I thought she tried to be dramatic. We always thawed these cans and this never happened. But on the ceiling there was indeed little orange spots spread out. 

While we cleaned but the remaining of the mess she said that it happened has she was reading a pretty personal poem he wrote. ""It felt the same way as to when I dreamed of Grand."" Grand was my grandfather's mother and she stayed with them (my grandfather pretty much never moved out and took care of her since his own father was never present (passed away while sleeping while Grand was pregnant while my grandfather)). Again

When my mother was growing up no one lived in the house beside her house. But the family owned it and my grandfather was now using is as an extra tool shed for his farming and fishing equipment. A special note about this house was its color. While the other houses were plain white or brown this one was completely blue. One winter evening my parents were coming back from a date and my father noticed the blue house and asked if anyone lived in there. My mother said no but he pointed out that all of the lights, Uncle Eddy has passed away a long time ago at this point. And this what grandfather clearly knew about but for him and the rest of the family Edmond was still there and was not a threat.

Sorry if this story is long but I do not know how to make it shorter. But hang on as my favorite part is beginning.

Few years after my mother's oldest brother decided to move out into the blue house. They moved out the equipment but some things in the house cannot be physically moved. Now what else could a young man in his own place do but bring girls over. And so he did but they never stayed around him for long after going into his house. Little things were happened to them. Salt and pepper shakers would be at the unreachable top of the pantry

One night

As far as I know not much happened after that. I visited him a lot but I always had a weird feeling in there. I loved to explore at my grandmother and even go around the barn but this old

Now we believe Edmond has finally left the house. We do not know if it was because my uncle found a good woman

I didn't talk to my sister about it, and the next morning I asked my parents if Dad had been in the room or if anyone else had been. They said no, he wasn't and noone else was either.

After Germany, one downstairs, and a little area at the top of the stairs you could look over into the living room. This is relevant.

The first night we arrived in our new rental home

I couldn't sleep, and then I heard a man yell. But he wasn't outside. The sound echoed in the empty house from the living room area. Immediately following this sound, footsteps ran up the stairs right into the room we were in and a woman began to weep near my head.

Needless to say

When our furniture arrived, where he was safe in a crib.

About two weeks after we got our furniture, and as soon as I stepped foot on the stairs, the steps stopped. My son went quiet, and by the time I'd gotten up there he was fast asleep, like he'd never been awake at all.

I didn't get up when the footsteps started anymore.

My husband left for his third deployment about four months after we moved, she turned around and ran to her room. But Ashleigh was still tucked in exactly where I'd left her, and was fast asleep. That was the first time I saw Emily from Germany.

A few months later, we were sitting there, watching tv, when the bathroom light came on upstairs. My son had gotten in the habit of climbing from his new toddler bed and spreading shampoo all over the bathroom. Mom saw a kid his height go into the bathroom, so I went up to see what was going on.

Again, but fast asleep. The bathroom was empty, the light was on, and I hightailed it back downstairs. Peyton and Ashleigh shared a room at that time since my mom was there, but he didn't sleep well in there. He would wake up crying every night, pointing to a corner in the playroom. I finally had to move him and Ashleigh into his old room and my mom took their spot for a few months.

A few days later, and a small boy, and it was signed Marcus. Other things happened in the house. I'd smell cologne when my husband had been gone for thirteen months. The cats wouldn't go into the upstairs bathroom, period. The dog unearthed small bones by a creepy statue in the backyard, and after she did that I saw a cat hanging around the house that didn't belong to me.

1344586419.0,xzkri,Possessed By The Dark [FR],pandoricahelp,26,6,6,"I'm a paranormal investigator, it was without the other person present.
We'll call this guy Dave. Dave had been in the US Navy for four years, we'll call him Derek, would go down and visit for a week or so at a time. They had some very odd experiences while Dave lived there, but this was one of the most frightening and bizarre.
Dave and Derek were hanging out with their older brother and another one of Dave's buddies, so Dave and Derek start drinking a little early. Now, both of them are ""experienced"" drinkers. I've watched Dave go through several shots of Absinthe and some mixers in less than an hour and still be talking coherently. According to what he claims, he was buzzed this night, but not wasted.
It was around dusk when they saw traffic slowing down. I 'm not clear on what was going on and I don't think they are either. They said cars were stopping and things were backed up

For whatever the reason was, by his own admission, he had been drinking, but he claims he was only starting to feel it.

Derek says that as they got out, scraggly cacti, occasional Joshua trees, and rocks, but mostly just the light brown sand. Dave walked down a hill, I think to answer the call of nature, and Derek and the other two guys lost sight of him. They waited a few moments, no response. So they all walk down there and he is further away than they thought. Derek said he had a weird look in his eyes. They called to him to get back in the truck

At first they thought it was a joke and told him it wasn't funny, where the water flows when it rains, so as Dave is running around, they keep feeling like they've caught up to him, only to get around the bend and see him further ahead than they thought possible. The whole time, they keep calling to him to ""get back in the damn truck,"" and he only responded with a bizarre laugh or told them to catch him if they could.

After about 20-30 min of this, but before long the oldest brother yells out. Derek and the friend run over and were not prepared for what they saw.

Dave was lying down

Then Derek noticed Dave wasn't lying on the ground. His neck was arched slightly, ""light as a feather, stiff as a board."" His body literally looked like it was made of wood with the way he was suspended.

As you can imagine, almost there, the brother felt a shove from behind but kept going. As they got to their vehicle, Dave suddenly begins moaning and talking normally again.

That is Derek's version. Dave's is similar, but then everything gets fuzzy. The next thing he remembers is looking up and noticing that the sky has changed colors. It is a strange shade of red, but evenly lit like it was glowing itself. He looked around and could see dark creatures, looking like they were made of shadows, staring and snarling at him from on top of one long hill. There were also shadows like people scattered around, and he could feel hate coming from them.

He then saw his body and was confused. It was suspended between the two boulders, his head looks up at him, his own eyes glowing red, and it smirks. It didn't say anything, just gave him a smug look like ""what are you going to do now?"" 

This made Dave pretty upset. Coming from the military, but he was mad, really mad, so he ""jumped"" at his body. The dark entity, whatever it was, fought back. He kept mentally cussing at it, calling it names and commanding it to ""get the hell out of [his] body!"" As they got close to the truck, growling at him

Then he was on the ground, trying to make sense of what just happened. They turned around and went home, and he didn't drink for a while after that.

So that's it, they find him balanced between two rock. From his end something dark possessed his body and he had to fight it to get back in.

I'll try to answer what questions I can. I'll ask ""Derek"" if I can't recall (I don't talk to Dave anymore). My thought is that whatever it was was tied to the land somehow, he's Chaotic Evil. That's why I don't associate with him anymore.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,

I posted here a few months ago about a rail that tipped back and forth on it's own in front of 2 volunteers and myself. Since then


What I am about to tell you has a possible human error explaination which I'm very aware of, I can't shake the feeling that it's something bigger than that.


I approached the shop this morning to find the back door unlocked and ajar by about 6 inches. My first thought was burglars


I wasn't sure whether I should call the police and not enter just incase but decided to go in anyway. It was creepy and my heart was pounding. I walked around the shop turning on the lights and looking in every hiding place. It was horrible! Satisfied that there was nobody hiding in the shop


Fast forward a few hours and I'm on the phone to the lady who was in charge over the weekend. I tell her about the door and she swears blind that her and another volunteer had double checked the doors before leaving. That wasn't a huge problem for me as there are a few other people with keys who may have been to the shop on Sunday. It must have been one of them. I stand in the back room


I put the phone down to go onto the shop floor to help with a customer inquiry. The customer tells me she may have left something in the shop over the weekend and I head into the backroom to look for it for her.

1341992442.0,wdj3m,[ME] The Basement Black Mass,venusinfurzz,27,7,8,"Hey guys.  I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while now


This experience happened several years ago.  A bit of background:  I was probably about 20-21, I know).  The reason I was still living with my parents was because I had had a serious drug problem for a solid couple of years of that time.  I mention this because I believe it could be relevant to what I saw.  Anyways, I was dating this guy Dan that had addiction issues like I do (also, I mention this only because I think it might be related).  However, we had both been clean in the months leading up to this night.

So, Dan and I had both kicked our habits for the time being and were clean and attempting to begin normal lives.  However, in the days leading up to the night in question, things were starting to slip again.  You know, a slip here, a slip there, but generally we were keeping it together.  So, we had both finally fallen and relapsed together.  This was pretty early in the day, you know what I mean by that.  Anyways, whatever
Carrying an armful of plates and to-go containers, black shadow in the doorway to the basement.  I said something like, ""Hey, Dan, can you help me with these?"" obviously thinking it must be him.  I don't know how to explain it - the shadow had no discernible features - but I could *feel* it watching me.  I just knew.  I stared it down and took one more step down the stairs.  I called out ""Hey!"" to no response.  I just kept staring at it as it kept staring at me.  Finally, I said, ""...Dan?  Hello...?""  But it had already begun to sink it that whatever I was looking at was not my boyfriend.  I blinked and blinked, suddenly, only to find Dan laying comfortably on the couch watching something on the TV.  I remember saying
Needless to say
The reason I mentioned the drug shit is because I've always wondered if the Black Mass is some kind of, to a T.  The night I saw the Mass was the first day of a relapse that would essentially send me spiraling into about 4 more years of addiction hell.  That's why I wonder, that's why I think about perhaps it was something dark that Dan and I had unintentionally ""let in.""

When I was about 8 my family and I moved into a new house. My mom grew up about 10 houses down from our new house and had heard stories about this one in particular because of a little girl that had been killed in front of it by a car. Anyway

One night I woke up in the middle of the night sometime after midnight. I went to the bathroom and came back to my room, him on top in a twin and me on the bottom on a full sized bed. I climbed up and checked on him, he was out cold. Then I decided to go look out our window, which overlooked the back yard.

I didn't see anything as I walked to the window, I saw something. I couldn't really tell what it was at first, but after a second of looking at it, I saw a face. Not a human face. It was round, almost a perfect circle, but was torn down the middle. There was an eye on either side, also perfectly round. The face itself was white, but the eyes flashed different colors, but it was more like a gash. It was hanging open

The two halves of the face tapered closer together the lower on the face you looked and were joined just under the circle by a rope. It was braided just like a normal rope. This thing is very hard to describe

It just stared at me for a minute or so before it terrified me so much I ran screaming from my room and into my parents bed. My mom still remembers me blubbering about this thing. Does anyone have any clue what it could have been? Or to try to debunk it? I have been wondering for years what this could have been. This was also my first experience in that house

1318283955.0,l7jtc,My Experiences Since This Summer,IrenaeusGSaintonge,24,3,8,"Some pretty awful things have been happening to me since about the end of July. I'm going to try to explain them here.

I'm a young adult male

Around July 27 or so of this year, so I have a lot of religious stuff in my room. Hanging on my wall  across the room from my bed are a couple icons, a large picture of Michaelangelo's Pieta, a couple crucifixes, some rosaries, and a prayer book. When I opened my door, I saw all of this stuff laying on my bed. It was a little odd, I saw that they had all been horribly defaced. Have you seen The Exorcist? That scene near the beginning where the statue of Mary in the local church was defiled? It was a lot like that. Disgusing, and it looked like the transept had been melted or something.
I don't know what all the drawings were done with. Paint, and had texture to it as far as I could tell.
I asked my parents and brothers if anyone had been into my room, and they were all fairly shaken. They were worried that we had been broken into, but there was nothing taken from anyone, and no signs of forced entry anywhere.
This absolutely terrified me. I thought about taking pictures, but there was no way to get that stuff off.

After that day I kept a journal in my room, so I wasn't about to fool around with something like this.
The rest of my post is going to be formatted like this: the date and my journal entry will be inside square brackets [ ]

Nothing happened for a few days.

[July 31: dark figure in the painting]
I have a painting hanging near the head of my bed, and the road extending up and to the right a bit, from the perspective of someone standing on the road. I came into my room on the afternoon of the 31st and happened to notice that the painting looked different. I looked closer and saw that there was a gaunt, very dark figure near the horizon standing on the road. I know for sure he hadn't been there before; that painting has been in the house for as long as I've been alive, and in my room for at least five. The figure didn't seem to be doing anything, but it looked like he was surrounded with shadows (despite being in the middle of an open road with no lighting around him). I left my room and didn't come back until very late when I absolutely had to sleep, around 3am

[August 3: woke up
Pretty self-explanatory. I woke up around 8:30 to go to work and found all of the drawers of my dresser, because I've gotten out of bed before and done silly things like pull off my quilt, but never anything quite like this.

[August 6: dark figure back
Same as the first time, all I can remember is that it was a gaunt black figure. I couldn't even look at it for longer than about ten seconds, because my peripheral vision would start to blur. I took the picture down and put it in a closet in the hallway outside my room. I couldn't look at the picture as I was taking it down; I had to stay behind it and only touch the frame. Something felt really really wrong with it.

I started having trouble sleeping at this point. I haven't had trouble falling asleep since I was about 7

[August 10: chair moved]
I woke up on the morning of the 10th and my chair was in the middle of my room, and a large office chair that sits behind my desk. It was the office chair that had been moved to the middle of my room. It's not easy to get that thing around my desk, so I'm not sure I could have done it myself while sleepwalking. I wouldn't have had the coordination.

[August 15: walls turned black]
This one was the strangest thing to happen up to this point. It had been quiet for a few days, windows open and it was nice and bright. Then something *shifted*. I don't know how else to describe it. It's like the whole room moved down and to the left just a few inches. My vision shifted with it, and the walls were a deep, deep black. Same with the door. There was black light coming through the window behind me. This lasted for about five seconds, and then everything shifted back. I thought I heard an echo when it shifted back, but it wasn't an echo of a sound. It was like when you see someone laughing to hard that no sound is coming out, but I was 'hearing' an echo of that. Sorry if that doesn't make sense; it's as well as I can explain it.

[August 16: computer won't work in my room]
This was the day after the walls changed on me. I found that my laptop wouldn't even turn on if I was in my room. I was carrying it from the main floor into my room, but it would only work when I wasn't in my room. This is still the case as I'm typing now, although there are a couple notable exceptions that I'll describe later on.

[August 18: Calling priest today. ______ help us.]
I tried to wrote ""God help us"" here
I had been telling my parents about most of what had been going on, and so they didn't quite understand how disturbing the symbolism so far was for me. Anyway, they agreed to let me call my priest thinking that it would make me feel better.
So I called my priest a few minutes later. This priest belongs to the Fraternal Society of St. Peter, as well as the other sacraments and blessings in the older form. This guy doesn't mess around, like me. After I told him the story he agreed to come by the very next day to see what he could do to help.

[August 19: priest came
The priest came over at two, which gives instructions on specific blessings, including exorcisms and prayers for houses. His was the older version again, which a lot of exorcists believe is much more effective than the revised version. You can't exorcise a house or object, only people, but there is a prayer in the Rituale that works sort of like an exorcism, to drive out demons, and we would see if it helped. I also had confession with him before we started
He started the blessings at 3pm. In some circumstances we consider this a powerful time to do something like this, so we would attempt to do likewise. I was instructed to pray silently while the priest said the public prayers. There were a few responses that I was meant to make as well. He had a small briefcase with him that had holy water, a crucifix, and a stole. Kind of a priest's emergency ammunition bag.
Anyway, like a very subtle greyscale. I lost a lot of time at this point, nearly an hour. I don't know if I made the proper responses or not in this time. I wasn't unconscious, because I still vaguely remember being present, but I wasn't fully there. I saw faces looking out at me from shadows in my room. They would move and disappear when Father sprinkled holy water or made the sign of the cross, but they would always come back in a different dark corner.
These were cute little imp-demon faces. These were dark and terrifying. They were grinning evilly
I don't know if there were hundreds during that hour, and asked me to call him in a couple days with an update.

Nothing happened for about a week. I called Father three days later, and we hoped that maybe the blessing was all that was needed.

[August 29: computer turned on in the night. He left a message.]
My hope was shattered at 3am in the morning of August 29th. I woke up to see the glow from my computer screen at my desk. I hadn't even been keeping my computer in my room anymore since it stopped working in there, but written thousands of times on the page. Not That Easy. nothateasy NOT-THAT-EASY!. The computer shut off as soon as I touched it to see if any other programs were running.

[August 29: woke up
This happened when I woke up that same day. There is a small public park behind our house which I have a clear view of from my window. The first thing I do every morning is open my blinds, this is the hottest portion of the summer, and everything is normally green and bright, especially by 9 in the morning. This time though, the sky was dark and grey, like there was no sun. It should have been right in my eyes; my window faces east. The trees and grass were a dull, dead grey. There were no leaves anywhere, the pine trees had no needles either. All the trees were like centuries old skeletons turning to dust. It looked like wrinkled grey hands coming out of the ground, looking out a window almost directly below mine
I didn't waste any time, same time.


You're probably wondering why I kept sleeping in my room. I thought about leaving a few times. It was awful, I had this absolutely petrifying dread. Somehow I *knew* that if I left my room, he was going to follow me. For now he seemed to be stuck in my room, but I knew in my gut that if I stopped coming back, he was going to come out and find me. Maybe take over the rest of my house. I wasn't exactly thinking 100% rationally at this point, but I just had this complete revulsion to letting him out of my room. 

[August 30: priest came
This one was largely the same as the first time he came, but this time the entire time Father spoke, all I heard was a low grumbling, maybe a growl. It filled my ears, and it was intense enough that I was sure it should be shaking the entire room, but it wasn't. I lost even more time, in fact I don't even remember Father leaving. I came to laying on my bed. I wasn't even surprised that I was there when I came to
As I lay there starting to become aware again, but I couldn't move yet. I still wasn't fully aware. I don't know what language he was yelling in, or if it even was a language. I can't even remember what it sounded like, but it felt like it was ripping my soul in half. I don't know how long it lasted, but it was 5:30pm when I left my room. I was dazed.

My parents realized that something was very wrong at this point, or at the psychiatric appointments, or that the psychologist could tell. All this crap kept happening over that time.

1318239263.0,l6wwb,Nurse,Kemica,27,5,11,"I have just stumbled upon this subreddit for the first time today

Sorry for the huge wall of text

At the risk of sounding cliche, I also believe that a lot of stories you hear or read are probably either fabrications, or something that the teller has worked themselves into believing. I say this not to be judgemental, but to emphasize the fact that I still can't explain what happened to me, other than to say that it still absolutely terrifies me to even think of it. I believe that either something truly paranormal was going on, or that some outside influence or severe night terrors/sleep paralysis was effecting me. 

However

The house I lived in when I was 5 till about 12 was a pretty weird one. It was originally a fairly old small building, and a tiny loft room we called, ""the hole in the wall"" which was just off the kitchen up a ladder. There was no plumbing in the house other than an old hand pump at the sink. The house was weird but I don't really know if it had much to do with what happened there. I almost think it was more something to do with the land it was on. My mother still firmly believes in Ley lines, and that the property was on a bad one, a really bad one. Many other people who have lived on the property (including the lady who lives there now, who is a family friend), has admitted having weird experiences there. However I am here to tell *my* story.
(I might be able to scan some pictures of the house if I can find them.)

My childhood bedroom in this house was in the older part of the building, and part window. There were two windows in the stairs, one between two of the steps, and one along the side of the stairwell. These windows came out of a workshop/washing room which was directly below my room. My room wasn't terribly weird other than being a very narrow attic room with a kind of slanted A shape to it, and a weird stained glass window over the main window (which was also the fire exit, via a rope and long drop).
The room below it though I never liked, but I did tell her to please not use those rooms. She told me to not worry, that she doesn't for her own reasons. They scare her too.
Anyways
So yeah

A lot of the details here, fell to my knees off of the couch, and started crying and wailing. I am not prone to hysterics. I was covering my eyes and freaking out, saying, ""No, no, oh god... how did I forget this?"" or something to that effect. I scared the hell out of my mother.

This is what I remembered.

When things really started getting weird

It started fairly gently. Just a weird voice telling me to, but right in my ear at the same time. Like a radio station with white noise and static, but a clear quiet voice that you could clearly understand.

I remember not really liking the voice
I don't remember how long this went on, to just listen to it, and every night, to just trust it. ""You can trust me. I'm your friend."" I never spoke to it, but I did think to it, I know I was always thinking, ""No."" or at least negative.
It got progressively insistent, ""Who are you?"" and it's reply was, ""You can call me Nurse."" I guess it thought that would be a name I would trust. But I remember it scaring the crap out of me. 
I don't remember the details but sometime after this
I would be wide awake but unable to move. My eyes would be, and the voice.

During this time I also had some of the most vivid nightmares of my life. Things no 7 year old girl should ever, a phonebooth. In every one would be the same man in a business suit, and he was always horribly mutilated and massacred in different ways in each booth.

Another weird event that happened in that time

Mostly I have the details second hand from my mother, like records etc. stored there. I pulled the boxes out and started digging through them in the dark. 
I grabbed an item, ""BURN IT!"" over and over at the top of my lungs. My parents flew downstairs and understandably wanted to know what the heck was going on.
The item I had pulled out was a Ouija board. I didn't even know what they were

The previous family who lived in the house had two teenage daughters who had played with Ouija boards in the house

So, that they won't think I'm nuts either. I truly believe every bit of this, but I do also believe it is possible that I was having night terrors, or just a hard mental stage in my childhood.

The most striking feature of the hospital is how completely trashed it is. There were abandoned tires
The entire mood of this place was close to something you might see and experience only in Silent Hill.  
Not really knowing where to start, tires and burnt wood.  
.  

We all came to a halt in the middle of this room and took in the ambient. It was completely unnerving
We were just standing around
It seemed to come from 2 directions: The hallway we had just come from and/or the hallway with the stairs. The voice was very soft and quiet
At this moment
The meter began to blink with high EMF readings almost immediately.  
We stopped for a second to verify that all our cellphones were off and we picked the EMF and moved it around each and every person in the circle to verify that none of us were giving off a charge. None of us made it blink whatsoever. We set it down and continued to ask questions. As we kept hearing her voice, 2 of our members called out that they felt they were being touched, more *specifically* stroked. As we stood around completely still, we could see the pant leg of one of them *move*. The zipper on his jeans had a small chain attached to it and it began to swing back and forth. Then suddenly, it all stopped. The voice completely faded and the meter stopped blinking.  
.  

Figuring she was moving through the building, hoping to find the source of the voice.  
We reached a few doors and walked through but there was nothing. The rooms were empty
We walked back and decided to move upstairs this time to keep verifying.  

As we were climbing the stairs
Most of us in the back asked out loud: *""What's wrong!?""*  
His answer: *""I just saw a nurse. A fucking nurse!""*  
As soon as he said that
Our colleague went pale and nodded while the leader replied: *""I saw her
At this point we were all getting goosebumps at random intervals and we felt a shift in the atmosphere.  
As we all stepped off the staircase and into the large hallway
.  
 
To our right
All of these rooms where falling apart. There was debris everywhere. Burnt debris.  
We walked towards our left and down the hallway and we reached the operating rooms. There were 2 operating rooms: Major and Minor.  
Everything in these rooms was completely destroyed. It was completely trashed
We began to hear things moving and the distant voice again
Once again, we just could not understand it. We began to record on a digital recorder, in hopes that the voice could be heard after some audio tweaking at home.  
After a few answers
  
Our colleagues kept seeing this nurse from the corner of their eyes, anything. Most of them turned up without anything, but I've only gotten to see my own pictures.  
I have yet to see the groups pictures
After the voice stopped
.  

I'd like to go again to this place and do a more through search with more equipment because I'm almost sure we had *something* there.

I apologize for the shitty writing and grammar but I haven't had any sleep due to this page being so amazingly creepy. After lurking around this website for the past week I've finally decided to contribute too. The earliest experience I had was when I was about 7 or 8. It was already dark outside and I was laying in my bed reading a book. You know how you always read about how the room temperature changes or you get a weird vibe when you are about to see a ghost? Yeah

There was also some activity in my parents room too. One of my sisters would come visit and my niece would sleep with my parents. She would wake up in the middle of the night and start bawling, but she always started freaking out and had to leave some sort of light on for her. It was also in this room where another of my nieces suffered a seizure or was possessed... I remember I woke up to the sounds of someone screaming their head off, the lights in my room and in the hall were on. The screams where indistinguishable, I didn't understand any of it. So I walk to my parents room and they is my niece, twitching and acting like if she had gone insane, blabbering what to me was just incoherence. I remember my brother slapping her, trying to get her to snap out of it. Finally they decided to call the ambulance and they gave my niece a sedative. After that incident

Fast forwards a couple of years, I asked him what the hell was up. Apparently they saw some girls face outside my window just staring at them, I asked them what she looked like and their description fit what I had seen. Another time my friend Arturo was playing KOF while I was in the kitchen or in the bathroom. He was sitting on my bed and while he was playing the apparition of the girl appeared right next to him. Of course my friends where shaken, so was I.

But this one has always stuck to me. It's Christmas '06 and for some reason me and my nephews and brother in law are talking about creepy shit. I tell the story of the first time I saw the girl and my nephews jaw drops. Apparently, so he could see me laying there sleeping, he looked up to where I was and sees the girl in blue overalls sitting right next to me. Being a kid he didn't think much of it and went back to sleep. His description was exactly like mine. I know none of these stories are terrifying but what left me awestruck was when he said she was reading a book for me.

1314279189.0,jtzvn,And the weirdness continues,Arakail,22,3,10,"So for the past few weeks I've been keeping up with some strange goings on in my area. Increased ""paranormal"" activity

Over the past few days alone, and there are no tree limbs between where I stood and the light). I've seen glowing eyes, more than once, only to look again and there be nothing. Felt something akin to static electricity when walking into places I know to be haunted, literally making the hair on my arms and neck stand on end... then go back to the same place the next day and the effect be gone.

The most prominent thing thus far, and my 7 year old son has been sleeping in the bed with my wife as we put a window unit in our room. I sleep on the couch, where the other window unit is, because my son tends to flip, flop, and flail in his sleep and I got tired of being beat half to death.

Anyway. I went through and turned all the lights out in the house except for the kitchen light, and lay down on the couch.  I hadn't even managed to really get comfortable enough to try and go to sleep yet, but had my eyes closed as I tried to find the most comfortable position.  After a few minutes or so of this, I had the odd feeling of something else being in the room with me. I cracked open an eye and looked in the direction of the front door and.... There was a face hovering there in the air. Semi-animalistic, and quite definitely straining to manifest (I keep my house heavily warded inside and out).  In all honesty, it had a face similar to one of those gargoyles you see on a really old church. The eyes glowed, as it seems everything else's does, almost prismatic.  After a few seconds of me watching it

So. Has anyone else noticed an increase in such things? Paranormal accounts and so on? Personal experiences? Or is it just me and my friends?

1311691332.0,j06ph,Why I Don't Like Hallways,sunshine654789,23,2,4,"I have been a passionate reader of r/nosleep and was so excited when I found this subreddit. I was fairly weary about posting any of my stories on r/nosleep because I know many people do not actually believe in the paranormal. Usually it is because they have never experienced anything for their selves, demon, I have never come across anything malevolent as far as I am aware. 

I have been living in the same house for some fifteen years and have been experiencing things since the year I have moved here.  My first experience happened when I was either 5 or 6. My mother use to run a daycare center from my home because she thought it would be the best way to work and raise her children. It was a sunny July day that was as normal as the rest. The daycare kids were playing until lunch at noon, since the back door makes a loud bang and shakes the upstairs floor when closed. I finished my business and opened the door and began my descent down the stairs. 

The stairs are against the wall on the right and there is a little bit of a banister to the left that closes off the hall from the stairwell. The hallway was always very eerie to me. It’s very tight and usually dark unless it was midday.  I always got the feeling that someone was at the end of the hallway watching me, skinny, and bald from what I remember. He walked so slowly down the hallway toward me. At first I thought it was a family member and it was their shadow and they followed it. So, being young and knowing nothing better I began to call to it. “Mom? … Dad?” No answer, just a steady, slow movement.  I was so confused, so I leaned over and looked down the hall and saw no one was behind the shadow. I looked at it in horror and it got still closer to me and was now directly across from me, like a shadow normally would. At this point

This whole experience of mine lasted maybe a minute but it felt like much longer. I remember frantically telling my mother and she told me that it was probably just a shadow of someone walking past the house.  Even as a 5 or 6 year old I could deduct that that wasn’t possible. The only windows upstairs in that area were in my room and my parents’ room. Their room was all the way at the end of the hallway. If it were indeed a shadow from an outside source it wouldn’t have went all along the hallway in the manner it did. How would a shadow get onto the second story from outside? Besides

To make matters even worse, it was at the top of the stairwell. I was downstairs with my brother who was maybe 4 at the time.  I called his attention to it and he acknowledged its presence. I went to the base of the stairs looking up at it and thought it was probably just my dad upstairs. So, I call to it again. “Dad? … Mom?” This time I got a response from the kitchen. “What T?” I was scared as all and they came looked up at it and said it was a shadow of a life size Barbie doll I had. I remember that doll. It was all of three feet and was missing an arm and a leg. This shadow had all its limbs and was again well over six feet. 

I know that my parents were just trying to calm me down as a child. Give some rhyme or reason to something we really had no explanation for. This is just the first of the many instances that were going to take place in here. This had to be one of the most frightening experiences that has ever happened to me,,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,True

Seemingly as soon as we realize this we see a light appear in the distance above us as though on a hill. It's square and framed like its coming out of a window. I kill my flashlight and we begin to get creeped out because we might be trespassing or something. While watching the window light we see clear as day a man walk passed the window hurriedly. 

The light turns off suddenly and I begin freaking out a little. Mark drops to ground and starts yelling at us to do the same in case he is looking out the window for us. Mike follows suit but in my panic-stricken state I begin thinking ""motion sensors"" or something alerted him to our presence and I begin running back in full sprint with the flashlight in tow. 

I hear Mark yelling at me to stop moving and that just makes the panic worse. After what seemed like forever I see AP's house in the distance and luckily AP was outside smoking so I sprint up to him and tell him we might have been seen on somebody's property. 
I told him about what happened and he reassured me that nobody lived this far back in the woods. (I had been around the property with him enough to know this but at the time I definitely saw a lit-up window).

 We watched through the window in his house for a few minutes and sure enough Mike and Mark come busting through the woods back to us.

The really creepy shit is that we retraced our steps as best we could in the daylight and we found the ""garden"" patch

That run through the woods has been the worst experience of my life.

Around five years ago, probably near 2:00am. We were talking and joking around like we usually do, then something caught our attention.

In our living room (which was part of a great room and clearly visible from the kitchen), looked the way twinkling stars do, were in a group of about seven, and they moved around but stayed in the same area and in a group. We both stood there and watched them for about fifteen seconds.

Suddenly, just really odd. I told my husband to look at my back to see if he saw anything. He looked and everything down my backside looked like it was being pulled away from my body. My hair, my shirt, my pants -- all looking like they were being pulled backwards.

After this went on for about twenty seconds

About a month after that incident, when something caught my attention. I looked to my left and a little behind me and I saw those same sparkles again. They weren't as bright because I was in a well-lit room. They floated around in a group about seven feet away from me for approximately ten seconds, then just disappeared.

We moved three years later into the house we currently live in. One night, I felt that same static electricity sensation on my back near the base of my spine. Startled, I quickly rolled onto my back (I had been laying on my right side facing my husband). The sensation stopped as soon as I did that and then I heard the snap sound again in the same corner.

A few months later, pausing occasionally along the way. After it reached my head and paused again for a few seconds, it went away and I heard the departing snap again. This happened at least twice more after that, each incident about six months apart.

I've shared this story with quite a few people. A couple have said it might have been aliens implanting something and then returning to activate it. A few more said it might have been angels or light beings. The rest found it interesting but had no clue what it might have been. As for me

Quick recap of everyone involved thus far:

Alex (boy with autism I worked with in his home)
Fiona (Alex's mother)
Spooky Thomas (the entity Alex sees)

-----

A while after Alex and his family moved into this apartment, and was fiercely protective of him. She began to get shut into the bathroom when nobody else was around. We thought that she was doing it to herself, until we noticed that she would end up with two or three parallel scratches on her back. The first thought was that she scraped herself on something in the bathroom, but upon investigation, we realized that there was nothing that would cause such marks. Once the family moved, this stopped happening.


-------

Fiona convinced me to come over and use a Ouija board at her house to see what Spooky Thomas has to say. I was a flat-out non-believer, starting with what made me believe, followed by the rest of the experiences.

I called bullshit on the whole Ouija experience, that I had fiercely loved but unfortunately had lost. She knew his death greatly saddened me, but did not know specifics (namely, that I felt he was being neglected and abused, and had been trying to get his caregiver [my father] to be held accountable for this by Adult Protective Services and the police. Terry, and was later found to be malnourished. My father inherited a large trust fund afterward. I still have not forgiven myself for failing Terry, and will never forgive my father). She asked if it knew anything about Terry

She asked for proof, you know that spelling is not always the best on those things. She asked if there was anything else, and it spelled out, ""SMLE"". Terry was non-verbal, but whenever I was having a bad day or had been crying, he would draw a smile across his face with his fingers. She could not have known about me blaming myself and my father, and certainly could not have known about the smile gestures. 

Fiona asked the entity why it was there, but when asked why it was there, the response was, ""SEESLITES"". Fiona wonders if her son's night terrors were something a bit more complex. 

When asked if there was more than one entity, the response was affirmative. When asked who, ""DOG"" was given as a response.

The voice recordings were mostly just us ladies talking, ""THEY NEED TO STOP."" and ""WHAT DID SHE SAY?""
A female was heard saying

Fiona's sister, and she had a long red mark ( not a scratch) on her back. She also kept getting the feeling like someone was standing next to her and had to move because of it.

On two separate occasions, saying ""Talk with us please."" Later research seemed to indicate that those two things indicate a malevolent entity/one trying to ""escape"". Perhaps people more knowledgable will enlighten me as to the validity of that.

I left feeling nauseous and weak, or related.

1349789765.0,1170ob,[me] the house i grew up in,helenres,27,7,2,"this is a little collection of some of the things that happened to me in the house i spent the first 18 years of my life in. i do believe it was haunted but i welcome any discussion that might provide any answers.

The house was not very old it was built in the post-war era so early 50's

the first thing i can remember is just a horrible feeling on the landing, it felt like this during the night and day. when i was about 5/6 i was playing with a doll house in my room with my back to the door which was open and like i said before faces the length of the landing. it was the middle of the day on a weekend and i could hear my parents in the living room downstairs watching the tv. when out of the blue i felt someone standing in my doorway, i knew no one had come up the stairs but there was someone there looking at me. i have never been that scared before or after that moment i froze solid, barely breathing i didn't dare look round. i stayed in the same position for a good solid 20 minutes then it just went. i remember thinking 'oh its gone everything is fine now' and i skipped down stairs like nothing happened.

the creepy feeling was still on the landing but that was the most intense encounter with the 'thing' as i call it. after my big brother moved out when i was about 14 i moved into his room as it was bigger this is where the really creepy stuff happened, whenever i was alone in the house the light wouldn't work. there was 2 switches for the light one down stairs and one on the landing. but neither of them would work i would have to run up the stairs and turn all the bedroom lights on as fast as i could. i must say the wiring was checked and nothing was found to be wrong with it.

my brothers room i moved into had the airing cupboard in the corner opposite the door and the bed was in the corner diagonal to this cupboard and the first thing i noticed was the dark shadow that stood in front of the cupboard it was there every night and it appeared to be independent of the wall. once or twice i woke up to find it had moved a little bit closer to the bed

A couple of years later when i was about 17 i had gone to bed normally about 3ish in the morning

1349170380.0,10t54d,Unexplainable things happen to a friend of my parents [FR] ,Syrina_Inavi,25,5,5,"Hi Guys. I'm living in germany and english is not my mother tongue. So please excuse if you find any mistakes in that text. 

So my parents have this friend, they found an old street. They believe it belonged to romans hundreds of years ago. 

Whatever. After they finished building their new house many strange things happened. I don't know everything. Just a few. 

1. They have a little dog. One day he started to face a corner of their living room and barked and growled at it without any reason. There was nothing. 

2. Tom and one of his daughters were sitting in the living room and suddenly they saw a shadow of a cat. (As far as I know

3. They got the turkish eye (the one that protects you from the evil or so) from a friend and placed it on a shelf. In front of the eye they had Chips, that all those things around the eye were still at their place.

4. Tom had a dream were he burried his father (again)
Coincidence? 

5. Remember the fallen eye from the shelf? They placed a decorative bowl on that shelf later. It broke into two pieces without any reason. 

I think that's all I can remember. My parents told me that after he was visiting us last week. 
Does this anything has to do with the romans? My parents think there was a burial place or something like that. I don't know if they found bones. I only know about this street.

1344565881.0,xz4iz,Situation in the Loft [ME] [FR],yellowtruuuck,26,6,44," Hi everyone. I am very new here. That being said
I have two really close friends (they are siblings) whom I stay with a lot. They come from a wiccan family, and I have always attracted the paranormal for whatever reason... usually negative. 

For the past few months they've had an entity in their closet. At first they deemed it harmless. All it did was move objects around... you know, and there was a very heavy feeling throughout their house. I was deeply shaken- I had chills, and I just couldn't tear my eyes away from the closet door, which lost its knob quite some time ago. I asked my friends if we could block the hole somehow, and one of them got a sock and stuffed it through the doorknob hole. We also put four crystals at each corner of the door for safe measures.

We went to sleep normally, but we are three young women, so any form of peeping from the living or otherwise tends to make me uncomfortable.

That day I suggested that we try to catch our little friend on film. We set up a camera facing the closet door and went downstairs for coffee. After we finished, and turned it on. We sat around upstairs for a while with nothing strange happening, so one of my friends spoke up and said, ""I kind of want to see something move. I want to see how it does it."" As if planned, a few minutes later the camera clattered to the ground. We went over the video, and it was very interesting. (With my friends' permission I might be able to upload the videos we got, but I'm sorry if they decide they don't want to be on the internet). Nothing happened again until shortly before the camera fell to the ground. My friend had gone into the closet to get something, but she was seen walking out after the other shadow passed over the mirror. Then the camera fell before our very eyes. The entity was becoming less shy.
After that incident, but the camera had a full battery. 

We decided to give it a rest and go downstairs. Of course, and everything was just generally eerie. I decided to go home. I had family coming in anyway. I'm slightly uncomfortable in my home as well because I have a little friend who likes to play with my deadbolt, but that's a different post.

Today I recieved a text from my friend asking me to come back ASAP. Apparently they did a little more investigating while I was at home
 
They're telling me that being in the room is almost unbearable now. They both feel aggressive, they feel it looking right over their shoulder. I'm going back in tomorrow to watch the video and stay the night. I think we're going to try to get this thing out, whatever it is. 

My question to you all is what could this thing be? I wasn't going to post this, and I feel that I triggered it by suggesting we film everything. Anyway, if you know what this is or how to get rid of it, please leave your advice, it is much appreciated! I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes. Tomorrow or sometime soon I will update and tell you all if our removal of the spirit was successful, and hopefully I can provide you all with our videos. 

Thank you so much for any help you can give us. We're getting kind of scared

1343458476.0,xag4q,my guardian. [ME][FAM],da_dovahkiin,22,3,7,"everything started around five years ago

I began to feel like I was being watched. it wasn't all the time, I ignored it all. I would be sitting on my bed on my laptop and feel the need to stare at a chair I had sitting by my window. this went on for a few weeks before I really saw anything. I went to bed earlier than normal one night (around 4 AM) and woke up to the feeling of being watched. I immediately looked over to the chair and saw a man. he had a hat on and was wearing an overcoat, other than that I couldn't tell much. all he did was look at me. I didn't feel scared in the least, I felt comfort coming from him. I relaxed enough to lay back down and when I did, he was gone. this man continued to show up in my room, always in the chair, over the next few months. my depression got worse and I took to cutting myself. whenever I pulled my razors out, I would see the man in my chair frowning. some time passed and I began to see him in my dreams. he never talked

after some time, but it always fit the situation. it was comforting to feel like I had someone watching over me, trying to keep me safe and out of trouble. he was like a guardian angel.

it wasn't long before my brother and cousin found out about everything. I was sitting at the dining room table talking about the ghost with my mom, and that I was nuts. my cousin said the ghost should get a hobby and move the fuck out. they later regretted everything they said that day.

about a week later, he said he woke up to his bed shaking and the covers were pulled tight around him. after struggling quite a bit he was able to free himself and he ran as fast as he could from his room. he started sleeping on the couch in the living room after that day.

a few days after my brother's incident, but it wouldn't budge. thinking I was in there with the door locked, she knocked on the door and called for me. as soon as she did, my door started shaking like someone was kicking it from the inside. she said she ran out of the house and was waiting in her car for us to get home, because she didn't want to be in there alone. after those two incidents, I became afraid of the man. I wanted him gone if he was going to attack my family. and I don't think he liked that.

nobody said anything bad about the ghost after that. my mom tried to perform a blessing on my room when I was at school one day. every night after that, but nothing worked. I woke up every morning crying.

after about a month or more of the nightmares, she yelled something along the lines of, ""you have no right to be torturing my daughter. what you NEED to do is to go into the light. you don't belong in this world and I'll be damned if you'll stay."" 

everything went back to normal again after that day. there was no more nightmares,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,t3_xag4q

1333883153.0,rz3z2,[ME]Trying to Separate Paranormal from Explainable.,KingKaribu,20,0,17,"I've been living in my current home for essentially all my life. For the majority of my time here

When this stuff started I usually shrugged it off as me hearing things, etc. But certain things got out of hand. I apologize if the title is tagged wrong but MOST of the happenings I'm going to talk about are first-hand from myself. A few are from trusted friends, but those ones tend to be shorter due to the fact that they didn't always realize something weird was happening.

Anyway
The early happenings were things I noticed but usually just got annoyed at, lights would turn on while I was sleeping and wake me up, my speakers would sometimes make strange clicking noises that I always tried to replicate by putting devices near them( Which never worked.) I would always just say something along the lines of ""Damn the electronics down here must be really messed up."" or ""Maybe it's surging and causing this."" But repairs never seemed to change anything.

After that I started having really strange dreams. What I was actually dreaming about is irrelevant but what would always happen eventually was that a small, when I saw the creature, or even just the decay, I would immediately comprehend that I was dreaming(basically entering a lucid dreaming state.) and go try to confront it. But, whenever I tried to see its face I would wake up immediately. Now I won't point to the dreams as proof of anything but once they started occurring, real world things began to occur as well.

I would be hanging about, hanging with friends, and so on, and me/we would hear voices in various places. The voices had no apparent source, weren't always easy to understand and, most importantly, did not match the voice of anyone in the house. And the phenomena was not specific to myself, at the time

In general

Over time things got more strange, mostly terrified. 

The night the really bugs me most is a night I managed to get to sleep(I basically slept less and less as time went on because the dreams made me wake up unhappy and feeling exhausted.) it was about 3-4AM and I wake up. I didn't know why I woke up. But then I heard my mom say ""KingKaribu(Obvious name substitute.), not in the state, let alone the house. (I should mention my mom spends about 1/4 of the year out of the state.) And I'm pretty certain I wasn't dreaming when the words were spoken and I was under the effects of sleep paralysis(which I've only experienced once.) Needless to say. I didn't go back to sleep or leave my room.

Now basic facts about my house that make the 'haunted' aspect kind of strange.

My house was built by my father in 1994. The house is build on what was clearly old farmland with old rock walls still nearby

The only linking factors I can see between anything and the 'haunting' are that it began when I moved into the basement and one I haven't mentioned yet. Which is

I'll include a picture of that foundation stone

1332633313.0,rc11s,My little experiences [ME and FAM] x-post from /r/paranormal,caehtruly,22,2,2,"Here's a couple paranormal things that have happened to me over the years.

I was about 7 years old when this happened. I was staying at my pregnant aunt's house for the night. When I used to stay at her house I would sleep on her bedroom floor because I didn't want to sleep downstairs on the couch by myself. Anyway, as a seven year old, I was terrified. Four years later the kid starts learning to speak. But something's not right. They take him to a doctor, and he is diagnosed with a speech impairment.

This is a story that the same aunt told me when I was about ten. Every morning she would drink her coffee on her back porch; she had this super tacky wicker chair set. One morning she we t out and all the chairs were gone. She has two levels to her back yard, as she walked by her back door window, she noticed something different. She went outside and there were all her wicker chairs, in a huge pile, torn to shreds in the middle of her yard. That's not it though, they were covered in blood. I know this is a now third hoof story now, me telling it to you

The rest of these stories are all me. At the time of this one I was either 12 or 13. I had a dream that I was at a funeral. I didn't know who it was for, like it wasn't their time. I wake up, unnerved but I carry on with my day. Two weeks later, my mom gets a call. Her cousin died in a car accident the night before. I never went to the funeral though, since I never met him before, even my mom didn't know him that well.

This one, watching a movie, if you must know is was Lady in the Water, and I decided I NEED SOME MOTHERFUCKING HOT CHOCOLATE. So I paused my movie, set the kettle, prepared my mug and waited. Then I heard the audio from the movie like it had unpaused, which would not be weird if it was VHS but this was a DVD. So I'm like NOOO I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING and run to the living room to repause it. But that's the thing, is my hot chocolate

These two are fairly recent, so I did. ""Fuck off, you are not welcome here and you never were."" The feeling leaves me and I go back to the kitchen where I belong and start making supper. Standing in front of the oven, I look past the kitchen doorway and watch a misty, white figure glide towards my front door. FUCKING NOPE but at least it left.

Second, wet because winter is ending but not bad enough to warrant a snow day. So I start walking to school and see my grandma at the bank. She says to me ""Oh, lucky you! No school today!""(she knew because she works there) I was thinking Are you fucking kidding me I should have listened to myself earlier, but NOPE logic had to get in the way.
So yeah there's my stories. I've always had spirits and entities attracted to me and I will try to remember some more stories! I apologize,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,t3_rc11s

Sadly, so I know this is the right place for my story.
Back some years ago, father, and I moved up to New Hampshire from North Carolina. We lived there for nearly four years; during the last year we lived there, my age being ten, weird things started happened that I just couldn't explain.
Now note
I had a few friends spending the night with me and we were playing school in my mom's room, and we started to hear intense crying. It was sobbing almost. You could hear the cracking in the crying as it got so high pitched. Being the nosy kids we were, we went over to the window to see what was going on. I wish we hadn't gone over to that window.
We saw what appeared to be a woman, right in front of our building. She had this long black dress, and was standing under a huge, black umbrella. The crying just stopped. She snapped her head back and had the most devilish grin on her face you could imagine. She winked and it was almost like she had been hit by a car, because her spine snapped in the most unnatural position, backwards and sideways all at once. She disappeared. Went up into smoke, so to speak.
Keeping in mind we were just kids
We heard cracking, just stood their in pure shock. I was immediately shoved down onto the floor with full force, and something started dragging me under the bed. I was yelling, trying to grab hold of something to keep me from being pulled under. My friends got off of the bed and grabbed a hold of my arms, trying to stop me from being dragged under the bed by God knows what. We heard the intense sobbing again, and whatever it was let go of my legs. When I got up, shaken beyond tears, and I was starting to bruise up around my shoulders where I had been pushed down. The last thing we ever heard was

One night I woke up some time in the middle of the night and saw a figure of a man standing in the door illuminated by the moonlight. Strangely I was not scared or startled by the man but rather felt at peace and that nothing was wrong. I had never seen the man before but I remember very clearly that he was tall with glasses and curly hair. He wore a brown jacket with a white shirt and jeans and was walking a small dog with curly black hair. He just stood there and smiled looking over the bed I was sharing with my mother. I tried to wake her up but she kept sleeping and when I looked back the man was gone. 
The next day I described the man to my mom and she had a very strange look on her face. When I told her the man was walking a little black dog she began to cry. She pulled out an old photo album and showed me pictures of my grandfather who died 2 years before I was born and sure enough it was the same man I had seen the night before. The dog he was walking was his favorite dog that was hit by a car when my mom was a kid. I had never really seen pictures of him before and I had never even heard of the dog he was with and I'm still really confused by all of it.

1314813214.0,k0est,The Old Rocking Chair [xPost from /r/nosleep],SupremeEvan,26,6,2,"Several years ago now

We're in his back room playing some Sega Genesis, so he asks me ""hey, want to come down to the basement to feed the cat with me?"" so I say ""sure"".

We make our way through the kitchen and we get to the staircase that leads down to the basement. Now I wasn't already too fond of the basement, small, cloudy windows that let in hardly any light. Nick's parents collected a lot of random things, and it was all piled down in the basement, with a path just wide enough for two people to navigate down there.

Nick flicks the light on and we make our way down. Nick can go first, so I have no idea where we're going.

""The cat's food dish is at the back there."" Nick says, but it was such an old basement that it was always cold.

We get to the little dish, so I tug at Nick's shirt and say ""what's behind there?"". He looks up, and shrugs ""I don't know, I think it's a cellar.""

For some reason or another, masks, armoires filled with old toys and clothes. I expected to find a room full of riches.

Nick opens the door

We stand in the doorway and Nick reaches in to find a light. I remember hearing the slapping from his hand and he searched for a switch. Then click. The light flickers on, watching it make full rocks from tip to tip, showing no signs of stopping.

Nick just lets out this yelp, and just wait there until his mom gets home.

Later that night after I'd gone home

Eventually my own mother brings up the story with Nick's mother. And here is where the story gets even freakier.

Apparently, but occasionally she would complain of it rocking at night when she was trying to fall asleep. They didn't believe her, but one night while Nick's mom was in checking up on her, she opened the door to the room and saw the rocking chair, slowly rocking back and forth, just as we had seen it in the basement that day.

1313731387.0,jnkw3,The Crawlspace (/x/post from /r/nosleep),,25,5,7,"I've had my run ins with some fucked up shit in the past

When I moved into this house, a decent kitchen, and two living room/dens. It's divided between the basement, where the laundry room and a couple bedrooms are, the ground floor (where my room is), the kitchen/living room level, and the top floor for more bedrooms. 

After I had finished unpacking everything in my room, into the crawl space. The crawlspace is directly right of the staircase out of the basement. It's pretty expansive, and it's got a low ceiling, but it's perfect for storage due to it being easily accessible, and quite large.

When I opened the square door to the crawlspace, so I just put it down to the snow being outside, and cold concrete walls. I grabbed a construction light, one of those ones with the metal grill and the hook on top for hanging it, and ventured in. I went to the far right corner, which is about 20 feet away from the door. I put my stuff into the corner, without looking around. I've become a person who doesn't like looking behind me if spooked, with someone always turning around

When I turned back to leave the crawlspace, was the corner directly right of the crawlspace. It was black. It wasn't being illuminated by the light. Curiosity took over, and I took out a flashlight from my pocket, a high powered LED light, and shined it directly into the corner. It wasn't lit up at all. Still black as night. This, being a Doctor Who fan, reminded me of Vashta Nerada (piranhas of the air) from a Series 4 episode

After that, and I don't even like walking by it.

Recently, Charles, called a plumber who ventured into the crawlspace to find the problem. The pipe ran through that corner that refused to accept light. When the plumber crawled in, he tried to illuminate it, also to no avail. He banged the flashlight with his hand, and it then worked. My only assumption is that whatever was there, moved. He fixed the pipe and then retreated very fast. 

After his rush of getting out of the crawlspace, as if something was watching him the entire time. He promptly left as fast as he could. 

The crawlspace door has been open since then

A couple of days ago, running past the square door as fast as I could. When all the laundry was done, I retrieved it from the dryer, and went to walk up the stairs. I swore I saw what looked like two cigarette cherries (The burning ends) in the crawlspace looking at me. I passed it off as overactive imagination, and bolted past. 

Last night however, I momentarily stopped and looked back. Something drained out of me. I don't know if it was happiness, or the blood from my face, but something felt like it was taken. They then proceeded to get bigger. At first I thought it was just growing, but then realized they were coming closer to the door. I shrieked, dropped the clothes, and ran as fast as humanly fucking possible up the stairs. In true Supernatural fashion I freaked

A couple hours later, I told him that the dark from the crawlspace was just creeping me out. He forced the door closed. When he went to open it again, there was a terrible cry of the metal hinge being strained. He opened and closed it twice more, and the cry stayed the same. He then closed the door shut, and placed a small TV in front of the door. 

The reason I'm writing this now

No one is home.

1311341669.0,iwsg6,Old Grandma the friendly ....... ghost?,CobaltSmith,26,7,5,"When I lived in Cadillac Michigan on 123 Burlingame st. The house we lived in was near ancient. I don’t know how old it actually was but I know we found a buried musket in the back yard one summer. I was only eight at the time *give or take* so I saw the world accordingly. 

Now, in this small 2.5 bedroom house my sister and I had the middle sized room with a bunk bed to sleep in. My brother had this odd add on in the back of the house that was more of a walk in closet but he said he liked it there. And of course my parents had the bedroom near the front of the house. 

One night I had what I assumed was another sleep walking episode, this creaking sounded like an old wooden rocking chair was rocking back and forth in the kitchen. Mind you I’m 8, so I just figured my mom or someone was in a rocking chair *we didn’t own one* in the kitchen for some odd reason. So, I got out of bed and went out to see what was going on. 

On my walk out, another one of these, great…..* so I just walked over to her and asked her what she was doing. 

She replied in a normal voice and appeared normal as well “Oh, I was interested in what this old lady had to say. By this time in my life I had already spent countless hours listening to my grandfather talk about his life and things he has experienced, so I loved just sitting and listening to older people talk. At the time, I figured this was just a dream anyway, no reason not to. 

While talking, I figured this was just some dream and no biggie... 

Eventually she said I should get back to bed cause I was a youngin and “aughten to be stayin up so late”. I remember that clearly cause I thought it was funny that I knew she said that all wrong. When I woke in the morning there was dried crusty milk all over the table and my brother was pissed and asked me why I kept playing in the kitchen all night. I told my mom *who had a very clear understanding of what was going on with me* about what happened and what I was told by the lady.

My brother called me a liar, and from that night on he never heard the creaking again.

However, and as kids go, he was eager to hear it and quick to dismiss it. Yet, right after talking about it, I looked over and could see the old lady rocking back and forth in her rocking chair, she turned, saw me and smiled and waved. What I didn’t know was, locked his door and told me to go away. His mother finally talked him down. 

Just an interesting and true tidbit from my childhood. I have quite a few more but most aren’t all too scary

1311275065.0,iw32a,A Night at the DeLorean Mansion,greggerypeccary,27,5,2,"***This story is 100% factual and true ***

I’m sure most people have heard of the DeLorean sports car made famous in the Back to the Future movies. The car itself while very futuristic was considered a flop sale-wise and by 1985 when the first movie came out the company had already been shut down by creditors. John DeLorean personally called the filmmakers to thank them for immortalizing the car in film. If they hadn’t his name would likely have long since faded from history.

DeLorean always had issues with money and by the late 90s he was thoroughly broke. He officially declared bankruptcy in 1999 which began foreclosure proceedings on his beloved residence in Bedminster

This is where I come in. The estate was purchased at auction for $15.25 million with the intention of turning it into a golf course and country club. I happened to know someone whose parents were involved in the deal and were acting as caretakers of the estate while the sale was finalized. Somehow the parents were convinced by their children to let the kids throw a New Year’s Eve party in the mansion while it was still vacant. I arrived with a group of friends in the early evening as the mansion’s foreboding facade set a stark silhouette against the fading sunset.

The main group of people were drinking and carrying on in the dining hall for most of the night and I was bored so I decided to explore the house a little. The place had more rooms than you could count with a domed library in very imposing gothic style and scores of bedrooms tucked away down labyrinthine hallways. There was one part of the house that I seemed mysteriously drawn to

That section of the house had a very strange, desperation, regret and longing. I quickly left and shut the door. Right outside was a small nook with a window overlooking the front lawn of the house. I got the unshakable impression that someone had once sat here for many hours staring out this window.

Eventually I rejoined the party downstairs and forgot about the room. Shortly thereafter someone chimed in, placed on the floor and the door was closed.

Almost immediately were heard screams and banging coming from inside and we were nearly trampled by Dave as he burst out of the door. He ran down the stairs yelling

The rest of the party proved uneventful but we all avoided the section of the house with the pantry like the plague. In the morning after packing up my curiosity got the better of me and I walked past the pantry again. The door was slightly ajar even though no one had been to that section of the house since last night. I got the chills again and quickly made my way back downstairs. As we got in the car and were pulling away I got the distinct urge to look up at the window near the pantry. “Don’t do it

The mansion became the main clubhouse to what is now the Trump National Golf Club and has been extensively remodeled. However I sometimes wonder what might still be living in that pantry

I was very young and my mother and aunt were downstairs in the living room and I went upstairs to get a toy from my room. On the way I went by my sisters room and I could see her laying with her back to me in bed. I called her a few times and she wouldn't answer I assumed she was asleep and continued on to my room. Soon after I heard our dog at the time Jack start to growl and bark in my sisters room

This experience happened at my grandmothers house and I was older. I was there alone why my grandmother had just gone to the shop. In my grandmothers living room where I was she has a dog bed for her dog which was currently at the vets. I was sitting on the settee and I noticed a brown puppy sitting on the dogs bed. I didn't react out of shock and then the puppy got off the bed and ran towards the coffee table that was in the middle of the room and vanished. I got off the settee and went to look but then the brown puppy raced towards my feet and I simply jumped back on the settee and the puppy simple vanished after hitting the settee. I have no explanation for this either. Both of my experiences have never freaked me out in the long run but I simply think of it being normal experiences.

1372754557.0,1hhipa,Not your usual childhood... HELP?,AriaStraw,26,8,8,"(I apologise for the lenghth of this

I'm writing this down here because I don't really know who I can talk to about it since my friends are all a bunch of skeptics and atheists. Mind you, whatever that is.

I guess you could say mine was not your average family: my grandmother on my mother's side had always had the sight and, in fact freaky stuff used to happen around her. My mother had some degree of it as well, which is odd seeing how that is supposed to skip a generation. Not that I'm complaining, I think that's probably what saved me from having more of it, cause yes, I got a bit of it as well, and it's not exactly something I was wishing for.
I'll spare you the details of my rocky childhood and troubled adolescence cause I'm not sure they fit in here and it's not what you're looking for anyway
From when I was born up to when I was about 12 I spent more time living with my grandma than with my mother, anyway my grandpa was always travelling for work and was never home for more than a week at a time, so it was mostly me and grandma, and even then, I spent a big deal of time on my own cause she received people in her study and I wasn't allowed in that room. I never really knew what she did in there and not for lack of curiosity, I simply knew that asking was right out of the question.

So here's where it all starts, in a big flat. Most of the things I'm going to tell you were recounted to me as I have little memory of what happened when I was on my own, though I do remember everything that happened when I was with my grandma.

As most children, and as most children, I was warned not to give heed to those voices. But let's face it, you're a child and hear your beloved grands calling for you, what do you do? You reach them, obviously. Doesn't matter that you're hearing your grandad's voice while you know he's far away and isn't due home for at least another week. So I spent my time chasing those voices around and occasionally scaring my grandma asking if grandpa was already home cause I heard him calling for me from the kitchen but ""there was no one there"".

Another thing that used to happen was that the adults would catch me happily chatting with seemingly nobody while looking up towards the ceiling. My mother, while my father didn't seem very concerned about it because I had allegedly told him there was nothing to worry about because I was simply talking to ""the pretty sparkles"" and looked happy. I'm guessing my grandma's opinion on this would have maybe been nice but if they asked her for it, I never knew about it.

I've also always had this thing that dimmed with time and age where I could sort of heal people... ok, just that when someone from my family was ill or had some part of their bodies aching, I could make it better or even make it go away, depending on how bad it was. I didn't see anything wrong with it, even though I had been told not to talk about it, so I tried it with a friend of mine who had hurt herself playing, a sprained ankle or something similar, so being all happy about the fact that I'd helped someone I went on telling my family about it and got scolded for it.

But I guess the time I freaked them out the most was when I was about 5, obviously), my first smile was for him and I would only fall asleep if he was holding me. He used to live with my grands but had to be taken to the hospital when I was around 5 because he got very ill; I was never told where he'd gone, just that he couldn't stay with us at the moment, and everyone was expecting me to react badly to the news but apparently I took it very well. Then, a couple weeks after that, I was playing with my Sailor Moon sceptre when my mom and grandma approached me saying they needed to tell me something and legend has it that I turned around and very serenely told them ""Oh, uncle has passed, I guess.

But that's just about where the pleasant things stop (not that chasing non corporeal voices throughout a flat is exactly what I call pleasant but it never did me any harm

Fast forward to the 10 year old me, WHY) with my mother and her new husband and never ever liked the place. It's the kind of place that always feels cold even when it is warm, I hated the vibe I was getting from it and would have done just about anything to not live there, unfortunately that was the period my mother decided it was maybe best if I spent more time at home with her rather than with my grandma, which meant that I was actually left to myself was once again while she slept or watched tv or did whatever it was that she did for her husband's job. 

So you get a child who is scared of the place she lives in and you add the fact that said child has been feeling followed ever since she can remember and that she can't shake off that feeling even if she's got her back against a wall. Then put in the mix the house suddenly getting chillier than usual in strange and definite spots and the child seeing things and you have my first encounter with something that I still can't quite explain.

It was a schoolday and I had just got up and had breakfast, and on the right was my room with lights out and door open. And just as if it was completely normal, a hooded dark figure glided from her room to mine, effectively freezing me on the spot. I stood there, paralysed, for a good five minutes when my mother came out of the kitchen and asked what I was doing still there, I hadn't shaken off that feeling of terror yet but still tried to be rational about it (I was a weird kid, I was the one who read the newspaper in the house, I was sure something horrible would happen to me once I got there and the fact that I had to get INSIDE to turn on the light didn't help
When I told my grandma about it, because by having them scared it has power over them and doesn't feel threatened anymore"". That right there and then was the moment I thought I had no want whatsoever to threaten anything and would actually do better without the ability to see anything.
But that didn't change much
And always
I later learned that before I was born, exactly, still isn't clear to me, but according to my mother that has never been ""completed"" (I'm sorry if that's a bit foggy but it's not something my mother liked to discuss with me when we were still on speaking terms) and I'm safe and guarded.

Now, I will provide them as much as my memory helps me (I do have blanks), or even if anything of the sort has ever happened to anyone else. Thanks for reading through all of this.",,False,,t5_2sntx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1hhipa/not_your_usual_childhood_help/

When I was a young child I would visit my great grand mother every day after school to wait for my mom to get off work and pick me up. My mother was pretty much raised by my great grandmother so they were very close. The weird thing is almost every day I was there

being young I recall digging many bird graves in her garden for those poor suckers. I would ask my great grandma what she was talking about and she would explain how in the native culture they believe birds carry peoples souls to the heavens. 

A couple years go by and my parents decide to get married. My mom always told me about how since she was a young girl my grandma always wanted to see her get married and promised her she would be there to see it. My mom had a great wedding and went to Jamaica for the honeymoon

1368027579.0,1dxqgq,[Me] [Dis] Encounter with an Old Irish Spirit?,Niallwithaz,23,5,9,"Here's a link that may help some readers who are not familiar with Irish traditions. I'd suggest reading the story first though. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee
I'd love to answer any questions too.

This story happened a few years ago when I was about ten years old. I lived in a small Irish town at the time. It was a rural town that had started to grow rapidly a few years previously. The town was getting larger but there was still a country feel to it. Irish people have that catholic stereotype but it is only after you come here that you realise that our old pagan traditions still live on. n example is faerie ring forts being left undisturbed on a farmland that could be used for fear of curses and bad luck. I have always been fascinated with old Irish tales of faerie's

Anyway one weekend my Dad was working days so it was just myself

After a while I began to hear what sounded like someone walking in the room above the living room (my bedroom). I remember pausing the game and going into the hall to the edge of the stairs and looking up but being too afraid to actually climb them. I eventually went back to playing my game until the footsteps started again. I remember thinking that it could just be the pipes in the house or someone walking around next door (The house was semi-detached and had thin walls so you could often hear the music or tv that the house next door was using). I eventually got too much for me so I grabbed a pair of keys from the hall and went outside to play in the front garden. I think I was also afraid that a robber or axe murderer had gotten in and was going to kill me so naturally I figured going into the garden to kick a ball against a wall would keep me safe until my all-powerful Irish mammy came home to save the day.

I can recall staring at my bedroom window with morbid fascination, like it was more ""shadowy"" or something. I was debating on whether or not I should just run down to the shops after my mam and find he there. After a while though I began getting cold (it's Ireland) hungry (10 year old boy)  and wanted to play my playstation again (Crash bandicoot!). I figured I would go back in but be on my guard and ready to run if anything happened. I think I left the front door open a bit so I wouldn't have to struggle to open it in a hurry. I also sat in the living room so that I could see it and be near it. This position meant that I could not see the top of the stairs though (which was fine by me).

After a couple of minutes the step started again and I began to freak out. Thinking back on this part makes my heart begin to race and it doesn't help that it just started lashing rain (again

As I went through the door and was about to slam it shut it the steps reached the end of the stairs and it felt like they were coming for me. I managed to get the door shut before anything reached me but it felt like I had just managed to escape from something. Exactly what I wasn't sure. I never looked up the stairs to see what was coming for me but I remember seeing a black figure on the bottom step for a split second. It wasn't a shadow person

Anyways, just that I was playing football out the front and had forgotten keys so had come to find her. She must have known something was up though cause I was absolutely terrified. We got back to the house and she went in and saw there was nothing up. After checking around upstairs (With a new found bravery now that my mam was home) I went back to my game and tried to forget what had happened.  Now the story could end here and I would think maybe I saw a ghost or maybe I was involved in a robbery gone wrong. But the next part really freaks me out.

 Later that day my mam calls me into the kitchen and asks me to sit down. She goes on to tell me that one of my friends dad's, when myself and a few friends were discussing ghost stories and legends, I thought back to this day and I realised that maybe that day I had seen a herald of death, a banshee. The steps came at me about the time that my friends father would have passed or just before. I'm not sure what happened that day but when people ask for a true ghost story I recall that story as one where I had a visit from the legendary banshee.

1365788777.0,1c7w45,[FAM] My Mom's Unsettling Experience At Her Sister's House,Arat90,30,11,7,"Originally posted this in nosleep


**Some relavant background information:**
My family (mom’s side) has always been pretty spiritually intuitive

This story takes place at my aunt’s house, Lan and Dan, in the same subdivision just a couple houses down the street.  Every weekend the family would gather at both houses, eating and drinking until it was Monday. I’ve spent a great deal of time in that house but when you’re there with a large family gathering, it’s hard to pick up on the strange vibes/occurrences that normally happen.  Anyway, I will finally get on with the story!


I was living at my aunt’s house at the time, there were no doorways and everything connected together revealing enormous space. If you walked up to the front door from the outside, you would see two very tall windows on either side of the door. Once you walk through the door, my room, the den, would be on the right. Immediately in front was a wide column that was actually a closet. To the left and further past this closet was the entire living room that melded into the kitchen and dining room.


As I mentioned earlier, I remember waking up briefly hearing the front door slam close. A couple hours later I woke up again to hear the same sound, I thought my mom had left to go to Lan’s house down the street. Later that day she would tell me what actually happened when I was woken up by that second slam.


My mom said she had come home to Vanessa’s house around 4:30am. She saw that I had fallen asleep on the couch so she took the liberty of sleeping in my bed in my room. Vanessa and my other aunt Mai went to Vanessa’s bedroom to sleep. My mom woke up around 7:30am because she heard the front door close. This was the same time I woke up thinking it was my mom leaving. She said she got up because she thought Mai was going to Lan’s house down the street and she wanted to join her to get coffee and talk. When my mom looked out the window she saw Mai walking down the sidewalk and turn the corner towards the driveway. My mom went to Vanessa’s room wanting to wake her up to see if she wanted to join everyone at my grandma’s for coffee. When she opened the door, see her long black hair and her body shape walking down the sidewalk. But then, how was she staring at Mai right now?


My mom called my grandma to ask if any of her other sisters stopped by Vanessa’s house to maybe pick something up but my grandma informed her she was the only one awake in the house since 6am. My mom Vanessa what happened but she appeared to not believe her. I think she was secretly terrified because that same day she went out to purchase curtains and draped them over the two windows at the front door so you couldn’t see out them.


As I mentioned earlier

1365238616.0,1bselb,Does anyone know anything about this cemetery that can help explain my experiences?,IXNOR,25,6,2,"Well

There's a small cemetery in Taliaferro County, back in the day, the settlers of the town had a few inclement run-ins with the natives and lots of blood was shed. There is little to substantiate these claims, but where would we be without stories? Anyway, at the top of this cemetery, there is a granite podium that serves as a commemorative decoration to one of the men buried there. His name and a little blurb about his life are engraved in the top of the podium.

On my last visit there, I got hit with an overwhelming sense of panic. I also got the impression of a name starting with ""Th."" It was either Thomas or Timothy. I steadied myself and kept walking towards the bottom of the cemetery. I hurriedly looked at all of the grave markers, and failed to find the name we were looking for. Right as I was about to leave, I felt drawn to the bottom of the hill. Against my better judgement, I investigated, and found a series of sunken graves, all unmarked and overgrown. The feeling I got there was comforting

On my way out, and that the memorial was tilted off to the left, perpendicular to the writing on it (which I found odd). I brushed my hand along the top of the granite and I was rushed with the face of a man with a gaping mouth. I jumped, obviously startled, and left in a hustle. As we drove away, I could not help but be bothered by the event, and the word ""altar"" kept coming to mind. 

I know that witchcraft is often misrepresented, as it is miles away from everything but trees. I know very little about the subject, besides classical Judeo-Christian demonology.  Does anyone know anything about this graveyard? Here are a few links for more info.

1360742666.0,18fog0,"The Beast of LBL (Land between the lakes, Kentucky)",JThompson1,36,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/18fog0/the_beast_of_lbl_land_between_the_lakes_kentucky/, here it goes:

There is a national recreation area in Western Kentucky (that also runs down to Tennessee) called 'Land Between the Lakes', 170,000 acres of forest and over 200 miles of walking trails. It is currently a focal point for over $600 million in the tourism industry. Prior to 1959, before the Kentucky and Lake Barklay Dams were constructed, and before it was officially called LBL (in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy), and before TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority, the federal government used it's powers of eminent domain to buy and tear down all the houses, forcing over 700 families to give up their homes.) took over the land

There are over 228 small family cemeteries, which include graves of white settlers, veterans from nearly every war, including the Revolutionary War, and also those of black slaves and Chinese immigrants who worked in the iron furnaces that were in the area. There was also a very high infant mortality rate and many of these children were buried right outside the cabins from where they were born so that their mother could peer out the window and see the grave. There are also numerous Native American graves scattered thru out the acres, much older then even the earliest of settler graves, some discovered

Back before the 1950's it always had been a very rural area to live in, back in the mid 80's that I first heard of 'The Beast Between the Rivers' or known now as 'The Beast of LBL'. Some old timers would sit on this long wooden bench outside the old IGA store, that use to be the old 'country store' for decades before the grocery conglomerate came to town. I used to hang around there on the weekends during the day and listen to the stories they each would tell. These old men, most of whom used to live in LBL before they were forced to move, had some very interesting stories to tell about that part of the country.

There was talk of hauntings, old hag witches that lived deep in the woods, and more importantly, several tales of a wolf like creature that stood on two legs that would come out of the thickets and attack their cattle and live stock. Day or night. A creature that was taller then an average man by well over a foot, nearly 7 foot tall, with thick long hair covering it's body, and a stench that matched that of some of the freshly open graves that were discovered now and then. This 'wolf man' left tracks like a barefoot man but where the toes should have been, with an extra long snout, they'd say. It had long arms that ended with huge hands and long spindly fingers with long, all would go out and tie up their livestock and even bring their most prized selections inside their homes with them. The legend of the beast went back at least a hundred years

The sightings of the monster where still frequent thru out the beginning of the twentieth century, arms spread out like it was getting ready to grab him, let out a howl and then sprang past him and into the dusky shadows of the sunset. This particular man said he 'wet his overalls' during the episode. Another man said he never seen it, but would always hear it's baleful wails frequently at night, not like a regular wolf or a coyote, ""No,"" he said, longer, the mysterious footprints left in the mud

But this isn't the story I was wanting to tell you. This was just a brief introduction to the unwritten accounts of the darker side of LBL. A prelude actually to the real story I will begin to unfold. I just wanted to lay some ground work so you could get the big picture

The summer of '88 will always be a turn about in my beliefs of 'real monsters' versus the demonic or paranormal type, for the benefit of you, the reader, I will travel down that route once more and try to recapture the scene so that you too will lay awake wondering and asking the Universe, ""Is there something else out there somewhere that is above us humans on the food chain?"" 

It was on one of those hot July summer evenings in Grand Rivers, when this took place. (Grand Rivers is at the beginning of Land Between the Lakes entrance.) The sun was not completely down and the skies were streaked with violet-pinkish Posy colored clouds that outlined the curtain of darkness that was pushing the turquoise blue away. I was staying at my Aunts house with my cousins for a few weeks during summer vacation, a very welcome home at the end of a dead end road. Hundreds of acres of woods surrounded the home that had been built down a hill and into the side of a large hill of dirt.

There were several homemade trails through out the woods that led to several places; an old abandoned rail road track that went on for miles, but with the new addition of a dirt bike that my cousin Joe had the trails became well outlined and defined. As with almost every day that I was visiting, Joe was out riding his bike through the woods, exploring, and just being with his own thoughts of a 15 year old. His younger sister, Ronda, was with me outside on the porch swing. She was 10, because his dad forbid him to be out in the woods at dark

As we swung back and forth, long, steady, and fast, with no shifting sounds, just a straight stream of one gear in motion with a full throttle, going at top speed. The sound accelerated as he drew closer at such a fast pace, he emerged from the woods in such a tenacious movement, and then quit altogether. Everyone was wide eyed and full of adrenaline, at the top of the drive

""IT GRABBED ME!! LOOK AT MY LEG!!"", scratches that tore through the tough denim and left small bloody marks on his skin. The marks were like a bears-claw-rake, not those caused by branches or sticky bushes, but a definite wide pattern of a paw print. ""IT WALKED ON TWO LEGS!"", his voice startled us again, as he was trying to tell his story in between huge gulps of air. He was frightened beyond belief, and the bits and pieces of what he was striving with extreme effort to tell us was coming out in loud syllables that filled us both with the same dread. ""It was following me through the woods....along the path....from the old sawmill....hairy...it was so hairy...and it's snout was so long...and it walked on two legs....it ran on two legs..."", slowing

A howling began. From the woods, staring up at the top of the hill, the nape of the hair on their back standing up, ruffled, their noses up in the air breathing in a strange scent. Then, a wolfs howl. It was close. It seemed it was just a few yards from the road up above. Just as the idiot in a horror movie stands and stares at something to appear, that was what I was doing then, mulling over the brief descriptions; torn blue jeans, but as it approached the one lane road that connected to the driveway, it only cast a silhouette of blackness

It raised it's long snout up in the air and let out a gurgling, nor was it a big foot, this was a wolf like creature that, like Joe said, stood on two legs, was taller then a man, and was staring at the three of us down the hill. Those huge, I will never get out of my mind. They were like two sockets of ebony oil shining under magnifying glass lenses. We ran into the house, pushing things, and he met us in the kitchen wondering what the racket was. Another howl from outside

We could hear the dogs in the pen outside going absolutely crazy with barking, then at the side door. We heard glass break. We could tell it was from one of the bedrooms, the windows were up high and they were very narrow so we knew that it would take some effort for anything to get thru them, but still we shivered from fright. Then my aunts horn on her Cadillac sounded several times as she drove down the road and approached the house. That meant for us to meet her outside and help with the groceries. We didn't budge. We couldn't move. We didn't answer her yells from outside for us to come unload the bags, we didn't crawl out and unlock the door for her, nor answer her knocking. She finally had to use her keys and then give some hefty push's against the pile of items we had up against the door; the trash can, 25 pound bags of dog food, and a variety of other stuff. We stayed put. She discovered us only after all the groceries had been brought in and she noticed that her bedroom door was closed and locked.

It was amazing that we hadn't cut each other in some way or another with the immature use of the knives in our haste to hide, then we finished with it breaking a window just before we heard her horn on the car. She must have startled it. She didn't laugh, she didn't respond at all at first, in fact she never said a word until she came back from inspecting the windows in the bedrooms. My aunt said indeed there was a broken window, broken from the outside in. She made us clean up our barricade and put up all the groceries. Later that night, after we were all in bed and my uncle came home, she related that evenings events to him. The next morning, ""Stay out of the woods.""

No problem.

He went on to say that he himself had went down in the woods earlier that morning and found several pits dug and filled with animal bones and parts of carcasses along the path that led to the old sawmill that couldn't be explained. There were also holes dug in the sides of the bluff along the hills that over-looked the old mill that looked like deep caves

Not to awful long ago, decided to venture into those same woods in front of my aunts house. They took a couple of pistols and two rifles and were gone for several hours. These were two brave men, the bravest I know of, both of whom served in the military and fought in wartime. These two men came back ashen faced and bewildered. They had walked all the way back to the old saw mill. The pits, fresh ones, were still around, filled with the bones of forest animals. The holes in the bluff still there also. They both experienced the feeling of being watched and felt an uneasiness that 'something' just wasn't right. The area where the sawmill was had no life stirring around it. No birds, no crickets, that science doesn't know about it

Urban legend? Maybe some of the stories passed along the years have been added too, and first hand stories are over time. My story wasn't an urban tale though. It was a first hand account of something I really and truly do not want to believe in, and wish I could forget; erase from my memory, because the nightmarish image remains real even though the events are still unexplainable by the laws of science as we know it.

1359046655.0,17742o,[ME] Doomsday in a Tree,keeks137,23,3,6,"I moved to the suburbs of Chicago at age 8 or 9

Long story short

One of the stories was of the infamous DOOMSDAY SAWS!!! I write it like that, but way too overblown to actually be believed. The story goes that there were two separate instances in which one of the kids from the block found a saw with the word ""Doomsday"" scratched into the wooden handle. In both instances the saw was found in a fairly random location, I believe tossed in a bush or something to that effect.

That's essentially where their stories would end. It was brought up as a fairly creepy thing that occurred, and didn't give it a second thought. 

Fast forward to my time in the neighborhood. We would play your normal assortment of games, you (and about 3 or 4 other people) could sit comfortably on the pine needle floor while you were surrounded by the branches, unseen from the outside. 

The other odd bit about the tree was that there was a flag pole sticking straight up through it. (EDIT: [Holy crap, was this thin white rope that disappeared into the ground. The rope was pulled taut.

We occasionally would discuss the rope

Ten minutes later he was walking back towards us looking visibly shaken with something in his hands. It was a saw. 

He told us that he dug for a bit, but it smelled a bit like well... shit. I can confirm the smell, we all went back and saw the hole that was dug up and the bags. There was definitely a smell about it as if you had stepped in a stray dog dropping.

The most interesting item was the saw. I know some people here will think that he faked it and brought the saw with him, but the pattern always struck me as bizarre.

We eventually showed the saw to our parents, but they just kind of shrugged it off. We were ""just being kids."" Truth be told we all eventually just forgot about it and moved on. Yet, it doesn't feel like I've moved on 100%. I'm sure it's common to look back on your childhood and remember numerous instances in which you were embellishing situations or letting your imagination run away with you. But, this actually happened. I'm not making this up. I still don't have an explanation for it, and that is always going to bug me in the back of my head.",,False,t5_2sntx,True

As they hiked they reached a cliff, where they could look out and see a path. They stood and watched, observing a non-detailed figure (i.e., the silhouette was clear, details were not) standing on one side of the path. The silhouette looked like an old woman, hunched, etc. The figure slowly crossed the path, they all recalled the incident with varying degrees of clarity (it seemed the youngest sister recalled the incident least).

1352408218.0,12vjtv,[ME] One of my first encounters: Haunted Car,hoonthatsc,23,3,8,"Hey guys
So I'm a huge car guy, primarily muscle cars and beat up hot rods. The way the shop was set up is that there were about 6 or 7 ""storefronts"", which were 10 ft wide by ~20ft tall warehouse bays that had a normal door in the front, and garage door in the back. Make sense? I was in charge of cleaning, part recovery (basically getting parts off shelves) and any other sort of bitch work. One afternoon, I was in the main parts bay that housed an old 1974 El Camino in the front, about 6 ft away from the front glass door. I was sweeping out the bay when I heard my manager call me out to the large lot that the bays backed up to. I walk out into the blistering Texas summer sun, I have been sensitive to ""energies"" and ""presences"" that my mom has felt as well. My dad always dismisses these ""I dont like this"" feelings as nothing, I.e stale rooms, had to push the Bel-Air into the bay where the El Camino lay. It fit in right behind the El Camino
The next morning, I was struck with chills and unease as I ventured inside. The air was COMPLETELY stale. It did not have a bad smell, it just felt....old. I quickly walked around the El Camino to grab a ladder for the shelves. As I passed the Bel-Air, my leg brushed the door. It was cool, if not slightly cold, to the touch. This was in a room that was lit by sunlights in 110 degree Texas heat. I backpedaled and grabbed the EL Camino. Noticeably warm to the touch. The Triumph motorcycle in the back? Warm. Bel-Air? Cold. It remained cold throughout the entire time we housed it. This is where things started to get weird. Over the course of two weeks, I was cut 7 times on various locations around the Bel-Air. I have NEVER been cut by ANY vehicles on the premise before, and would usually come away with a shallow gash or scrape from some unseen shard of metal. 
I could brush all of this as simply cold spots, until I experienced one horrific event as I was closing up the shop three weeks after we got the car. (No work was ever done on it, it was hard to find parts). I was making sure all of the doors were closed and locked for the night, as I had stayed late to work on my Beetle. I went to check the parts room, and  the door was securely locked. Keep in mind it ONLY locks from the outside, so I can dismiss co-worker involvement. As I turned to walk away from the warehouse, I hear a slight scuffle on the papered over windows. Thinking it was a rat or mouse, hoping to scare away whatever it was. Immediately, as my ""senses"" went haywire. I locked the door and sprinted back to my car and flew about 90 the whole trip home

Although this particular encounter was not my first

I’m in my sophomore year at one of the local high schools in my small city and I've had experiences with the supernatural for as long as I can remember. I know that some of you will instantly assume that I’m schizophrenic but oddly enough the majority of my experiences have taken place when other people have been around and I have never been the only person to see or hear what had happened. 

Sadly however
 
This experience took place during my freshman year of high school. It was around 5 in the morning and after getting ready for school I went downstairs to finish my French essay which was due that day. I wasn't usually awake this early but after having a long peaceful night’s sleep I was full of energy so I decided it would be best to do something productive. My house was deathly quiet as the rest of my family wouldn't be getting up for at least another hour so I tried my best to be quiet. I had been at the desk in my living room typing for about half an hour when I heard the kitchen cupboards slamming and someone rapidly walking around on the tile floor. Right away I figured that it was my older brother, other than that the only other option would be to break a window. The windows were intact and it wasn't humanly possible to escape any other way in that short amount of time. My blood was pounding as I sprinted up to my room no longer caring whose sleep I disturbed. I slammed my door behind me and jumped onto my bed wrapping myself in the safety of my quilt. I stayed there shaking with fear until it was time for me to get the bus.

 I didn't talk to anyone in school that day and when my French teacher asked why my essay I had a feeling that my experience wouldn't qualify as a valid reason in her books. 

I have not seen that man again. I have named him Jim because I figured that by giving him a non-sinister name it might make him a little easier to talk about. To this day the only people who know about Jim are my best friend Danielle who has shared many supernatural experiences with me and now all of you in the Reddit community. I will post some more of my experiences soon if you care to hear about them.

Not sure what to do, creaks and old house sounds. We've renovated bathrooms, added a pool, painted, plastered, moved stuff, and nothing has changed... until we messed with the attic.


The ceiling above our living room is supported by large beams, lift up the boards, and work on fixing the ceiling. The floor in the attic is raised, beneath is all the insulation. We started clearing out insulation and found some old things that had to be from owners long long ago. Tiny white children's shoes, cutlery, pantyhose, and a few sticks wrapped with string. It wasn't the first time we'd found old things.


Previously, spoons, knives, and most surprisingly-- a silver revolver. We kept these items for a couple years on display (I wish I had pictures) but they disappeared about 2006/2007. I've tried to find them but nobody in my house (about 4 other people) have any idea where they went. 


A few weeks after finishing up the attic the dogs start acting strange. We have a beagle and dachshund. The dachshund will start barking while staring up at walls like someone is standing there. Our beagle wakes up at 3am and runs around the house barking like a maniac and nobody can calm him down or keep him quiet. Both of our dogs have starting sitting and barking in this ONE area of the front hallway and won't leave. The beagle


One night


The next day, but we all know a dog doesn't *knock* high on the door they scratch at the bottom of the door. She wouldn't yell hello if the dog ""knocked"" on the door.


Two nights ago, a mattress pad, and a ton of pillows... but no matter what I do I hear what sounds like somebody in the dining room. Walking around, moving stuff, and the distinct noise of a cabinet opening and closing over and over. It's driving me crazy and I'm a little frightened so I crank up the television and go to sleep. 


About 3am that night


LAST night was the icing on the cake. Me and one other member are the only people in the house. We're watching TV and have it on mute during some commercials. We're talking to each other about how we've been hearing strange noises at all hours of the day and night. As we're talking the dachshund starts barking uncontrollably at the front hallway (per usual). I go over to her and she's looking up, with all his hair on edge. I angrily put them outside as they're barking was overpowering the TV. I got back to the living room.


At another commercial break we muted the TV. This time, we stay quiet and listen close. Another bang follows... and then the distinct sound of heels on a wood floor as it gets louder like it's nearing us in the living room. We're both really nervous and laughing/crying looking at each other. I get up to walk over to the hallway to see if maybe someone just got home and I walk straight into a wall of ice.


Literally, and to my right arm. 


I run over and put my hands on the other person and I'm yelling, my right is like ice!"" He stares at me and you can tell he's really freaked out. I'm honestly pretty giddy about it at this point, as it doesn't scare me as much as excites me. Did I just walk into something or someone?

I do want to keep some privacy so I'm going to try and obfuscate some details. Here goes...

Last October

I arrive at the hotel on a Sunday but the incident didn't happen until Wednesday or Thursday night

First off, Wednesday, and Thursday morning.

Thursday night. I get in bed around 10 pm

My eyes dart open as I hear the ominous but familiar beginning of a famous song...the freaking Ghostbusters theme song! First thoughts going through my head: wtf, turn it off, be quiet, I want to sleep.

Here's where it gets weird. I reach out, annoyed, I start moving the mode switch, trying to get it to 'off.' Moving the switch has no effect either! I do remember the song sorta cutting off kinda like when you move the radio dial and the sound fades in and out as you switch frequencies, but if I really had my hand on the frequency dial I should have run into other radio stations, unless every radio station was playing the same song. Finally, I move my hand over to the volume dial and turn it all the way down. It works.

Now it's quiet. As I lay there, look outside, look in the reflection on the window for any signs but I don't see or feel anything. Whatever happened, it's over now. I go to the alarm clock which is behaving normally now and set it for 5 am, it did seem like it was reset to 12:00. It takes me a little longer to fall asleep, but I really don't believe in ghosts and I just brush it off as the alarm clock getting reset somehow and some radio station was playing the Ghostbusters theme song at exactly midnight.

Wow this is getting long, but they seem to humor me.

The weird parts are the fact that the Ghostbusters theme song was playing exactly at midnight

Two weeks after my incident I did some google snooping on the hotel, a girl had been murdered in her room at the hotel, two floors below where I was staying. She was described as a fun loving girl who enjoyed playing pranks.

First Major Event: Holy Water
From what I can remember this activity happened around mid to late November, but my girlfriend kept complaining about a smell of fart in my room. Unfortunately I was notorious for this so she assumed it was me, I thought it was her just trying to be cute and covering up her own but it wasn't, it was a kind of hot burning smell. This smell was there for an entire day. ONly then did I remember that the smell of sulfur (aka the stuff that goes into stinkbombs) is linked directly to the presence of a demon. This naturally set me off and freaked me out.

.

.

.

.

.

I didn't say anything to my girlfriend about the sulfur, getting some cider to drink later and we went in to my room as normal. What happened freaked us out but not as much as the thing after. Simply put while walking into my room the strings on my guitar managed to strum themselves, I thought I might have brushed off it but it was too clear and distinct, if I brushed off it chances are the guitar would have fallen over instead of playing the notes as cleanly as it did.

.

.

.

.

.

The next day I remember I was driving my girlfriend home that night instead of her sleeping over so I remember we were leaving early enough, except when she was washing her hands she saw she had a 2 inch scrape going diagonally across her throat. It wasn't a light scrape it had broken the skin cleanly and it was bleeding, not heavily but enough that you would notice it. Prior to this happening to her I had told her about times that I'd wake up with scratches on my body or how they would sometimes appear randomly on my arms, my scratches were all light and I played it off as dry skin, but they were never as heavy as the scratch I saw on her neck.

The next night we went to sleep as normal. At the time I had a lot of differennt posters decorating my room that had stood the test of time never losing their grip to my wall. However

North of where I grew up is a wooded area with the remains of a house and an old mill in it. While the area has been all but razed to put up subdivisions, and the requisite stories of the unburied dead that wandered among the trees.

It was Halloween in the early 90's and while we had long left high school, Marty, Creeping Bob and myself. The plan was to collect up enough wood to last the night while it was still light out, head back to town for food and beer, and finally head back up to the Lot after dark with everyone else. We arrived at around 4:30 or 5:00, pulled over to the side of the road, and made the short hike through the woods to the old mill.

Upon entering the woods, Johnny suddenly jumped back in alarm. We looked over at what startled him, and saw a young woman about 18 in a white, old-fashioned type dress that was covered in mud and dirt from head to toe. Her hair was blonde, dirty with soil and was in quite a state. I also noticed she lacked a shoe on one foot and a sock on the other. She looked at us with this wild, crazy stare and ran off back towards the road where we parked the car. Johnny, Creeping Bob and I had all seen her, Marty rejoined us from the direction the girl headed.

We all asked him if he saw the girl, he figured we made it up as a story to scare him. Marty could get violent rather quickly, so rather than try to convince him of what we saw, we just dropped it. We continued into the woods and collected up a rather large pile of wood. Satisfied with our efforts, we started back to the car just as the woods were entering twilight. 

As we approached the spot where we first saw the creepy girl, there she is! I can see her now!""

No sooner had the words escaped his lips when she returned out of the darkness, we were thoroughly creeped out. Marty was trying to ask if she was OK, but she simply followed in silence. As we neared the treeline at the side of the road, I turned back to her.

""Do you need a ride someplace?"" I asked.

""No

She then turned and started heading back into the woods as we made a hasty retreat to the car. 

As we drove back to town, it was a weird and crazy way to set it up. After all, we were the only ones at the Lot, and had we not made plans for a bonfire there, she would have been without anyone to impress with her getup. I suggested that perhaps she was the victim of a sexual assault, given her condition and the crazed mannerisms she displayed during our first encounter. However, had that been the case then why would she risk a second assault by following four guys around the woods? One would think the victim of that type of crime would be wary of strange men immediately afterward. As we all pondered what happened in silence

When I was eight years old, something seemed off.

However, sometimes it would be unbearable and I go to my parents room. As expected, they shrugged it off and told me to go to sleep.

Then came one evening when I was in my messy playroom near the door with the step that lead to my bedroom. Although pointless, I dropped my books and hid my eyes in fear. Moments later when I worked up the courage to open my eyes, the Tall Man was no longer there.

My Aunt moved into a small house right next to the downtown part of our small town, not sure why but they work late nights alone, maybe the same issue.

Anyways, amazing cousin who is ten now and was born when I was around thirteen. He had a lot of problems at birth and was costantly sick until he was about four, incidentally around when they moved out of that house. My Aunt is a very practical woman and is very skeptic about things like this but my brother and my mom and I all agree there was something wierd about that place, the tv would randomly turn on and off and there was a bad smell that would just appear and then fade away. This house was built in the 1930's and when she moved in there was a whole bunch of random shit in the basement, old pictures and figurines, most of which she kept since she is collector of antiques.
 
I used to go over there all the time on weekends to help her out(she was a single mom and needed all the help she could get). The first time I went there to stay the night I was around 14, Shayla, who was as dumb as a bag of hammers but also the sweetest dog in the world, who followed me around constantly. 

Shayla would stick next to me but when I went to go to bed it took some coaxing to get her into the guest room with me, I held my breath to see if it was just my own breathing I heard and I was still hearing another person as well as Shayla. All of a sudden the dog started growling(I had never heard her growl before then, unless someone she didn't like got too close to the baby) and I heard the bed creak as if someone was getting up from it. I felt something move close to the bed and the dog gave a loud yelp and ran from the room, obviously I hustled the fuck outta there as well to the living room. As soon as I left the room the lights flickered and the door closed behind me, not slammed but closed gently. I must have passed out on the couch because that's where I woke up with the dog on the floor next to me.

I'm sure most of it can be debunked or whatever

This house was no different. In the first day I was roaming around I found a small hallway closet next to what would be one of my rooms for a time. Inside were weird pictures - they were so faded and old that when i picked them up they crumbled almost to dust. My mother came along and told me to not play with dirty things

One day I remember my mom and teenage step-sister openned my bedroom door and look at me oddly and asked me if i was talking to someone. I said no - I was listening to music on my headphones. Later my mom would tell me that she and my stepsister had heard talking

I was sitting in the livingroom with them both one evening watching some show on comedy central. They were each sitting at different ends of the sofa, they don't like you."" 

According to my mother someone had yelled at my stepsister from the hallway and said ""SHUT UP!"" - she moved out a bit after that.

Later on I changed rooms to the one in the middle of the hallway. When inside my room the layout was as follows: to the right my parents room, a bit small, and only showed itself at the top of the gap, closest to the ceiling.

I looked down, towards my parents room. 

We didn't have green colored flashlights

I tried to hear footsteps - the floor is tile

Then the light disappears from view. Did it go into my parents room?

This experience comes from a sewer line really close to the park where the previous encounters happened. We'd heard an old legend that a few people were killed in an old abandoned incinerator and that the killer had hid the bodies in the sewer system and that there had been ghost sightings recently around the sewer system. So, we had to know about it. And kick the ghosts asses if we could. Like I said, fucking stupid. This was maybe a year before my encounter so I didn't know what I was messing with, but I'm still confused why everyone wanted to go,because they DID know. 

Anyways, standing outside that tunnel it gets cold immediately, maybe because of the air inside being cooler, but it still seems unnaturally cold. 

After about five minutes of walking we had to use our flashlights. It wasn't long before we came to a set of tunnels within the tunnel. Ryan suggested splitting up, Corey and Kenny, Josh and Paul. (Once again, fake names. Those are some cheesy ass names.) 

Ten or fifteen minutes after splitting up, when there's all that space, sounds get hard to decipher. Same thing going on here. It sounded like it could have been a scream, but it also could have been from someone dropping something. We had no idea and decided that going back wasn't a good idea because we had no idea where they could be or how far down they were, or if anything had even happened. (Just wanna stress that I thought this shit through ahead of time, but no one fucking listened.) Our tunnel came to an opening  that merged with the waterway a bit past the park so we turned around. On our way back we heard a definite yell and running through shallow water. Me and Ryan looked at each other and pretty much decided that we should back out of the tunnel and hike through the woods back to the entrance, rather than run half-blind through a tunnel. 

At that point we saw a bluish blur in the tunnel and heard a growl that sounded like a lion. For the tiniest split-second, running as fast as I could towards where I expected my friends to be. I didn't notice this in that second, but Ryan wasn't with me. I don't know where he was, but he was at the entrance, before me. He said he went a different way through the woods. We heard our friends running and asked them what happened when they'd come out, but they ran right past us. 

""Dude, while me and Ryan tried to figure out what happened from Corey and Kenny and how they ALL had something happen to them. Corey wasn't speaking about it. He just kept saying ""Fuck that, I'm never going back there."" But Kenny spoke up. He said he didn't see anything at all, until Corey had ran. Corey was running away and Kenny looked back and saw the same thing I did, but that it ""screamed"". That was enough to make Kenny run. Josh and Paul said they didn't see anything but heard growling and ran because even if it was just a dog, they thought it could be rabid. Once they ran they said it was like they weren't running. Kind of like in a dream how you feel like you can't run fast enough, or punch hard enough. 

After that

The next night, and smelling like a sewer. Their parents thought we were getting high in the sewers. So it was just me and Ryan. (I can't help but notice he's always around. More on that in a bit.) 

As we walked up to the building I thought I saw a shadow near the door move and run away but I didn't mention anything. I know how easy it is to be scared of shadows at night, amazingly enough, was OPEN. Not locked, or even closed. WIDE OPEN. The first room we encountered was a big open room with a trash compactor in it, and two staircases leading up to the second floor. We took the closest staircase. Now, the thing about that staircase is that there is a chair, nailed to the wall, (or what used to be offices, and a cat. Whole skeletons. It scared the shit out of me. What was worse were the candles. They were red a black and ALL over. We explored the rest of the building and found nothing. We didn't see or hear anything but as we left it started raining. I remember Ryan didn't say more than one word sentences on the way home. 

I think it's centered around him. He's always there. I've been to these places without him and nothing happens. It kinda strikes me as odd though. If these are native american creatures, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

The first was more masculine. But it said less. It said, **""I'm here. In the darkness. I'm here.""** 

Then static. Then a woman's voice, reading off numbers. I don't have all of the strings written down. At first it seemed like she was just randomly stringing numbers along. *""Two. Three. Five. Seven. One. One. One. Three. One. Seven. One. Nine. Two. Three. Two. Nine.""* and so forth. It wasn't til I had them written down in front of me (and I'll admit, it took me longer to realize than it should have.

So here is my first story:


So this happened over a decade ago when I was 16. I was spending the night at my best friends house. He lived with his grandparents, arts &amp; crafts center, horses, fields, and lakes.

So we decide to go there one night about 1 or 2 am. Been there a million times, so its a little walk. So on our way there we have to pass this really out of place house.

Now we always thought this house was weird because obviously no one could live there its in the middle of nowhere on this jewish center. We always figured it was there because the people who donated the land to the jewish center used to own it or something. Anyway regardless

Now as were walking past at the bottom of the hill

So like a pair of idiots my friend and I decide to go investigate. We trek up the small hill and we approach the car port of this house rather quickly. Well we get right there and looking in the car port

So I open the door and I can see little bits of the floor inside from the moon shining through...I can see that the floor is all caved in and falling into the basement. I look back to my buddy and I remark how it looks pretty dangerous and lets not go inside. So I close the door and it slams shut. Then we hear something right above us ...""boom boom boom"" . It happened so fast but I hear what sounds like something big on the roof running, but my buddy and I chase the sound to the edge of the car port.

We see this thing jump from off the roof and dart down the hill right in front of us. We only saw this thing for about 2 full seconds before it was down beyond the crest of the hill where we couldnt see the bottom. It looked like a human..it was dark and all black so it looked like a shadow

Now i forgot to mention...at the bottom of this hill is a field for about a hundred yards or so then the tree line. But in that field is nothing, looking at nothing. I was puzzled how something...man or animal could have moved that quick and disappeared like that. We are standing there, still haven't spoken a word to each other yet.

It didn't really hit me that I needed to get the fuck out of there until my buddy spoke...looking terrified and confused...""did that look like a man to you?"" I couldn't tell what it was

This starts where the last part left off.

A couple of days later I was, we’ve all had to work the graveyard shift. Two co-workers confirmed what I heard. In their case, one of them had fallen asleep on the front desk and at around 3 am, she woke up frightened because someone/something had woken her up by, apparently, punching the desk. She almost ran away from the hospital. The other co-worker told me that while she was sitting at the same desk doing work, she felt like someone pulled her hair. They both hate that shift.

What was/is happening to us intrigues me so, which is on the same floor as the OR. What I’ve been told is that several ICU patients have pointed out seeing and hearing children playing inside their rooms. One patient in particular asked several times why those children where allowed to play there and so late at night. Later that night, he passed away. Nurses and other people around him could not see nor hear these children he spoke off. I’m not sure how or why it happens, but it did; The chilling part of this is that when these patients see the children playing, they don’t live to see another night.

I’ve also been told about a nun that helped patients in the Maternity Ward, I remembered an experience I had a few days earlier to knowing about this nun. I was in the Maternity Ward checking some patient records for surgery the next morning when, out of nowhere, a nun came by to ask me where a specific room was. I told her and she turned around and went on her way. This stands out in my memory because I remember wondering: “What the hell is a nun doing in the hospital at 3:30 am?” The hospital closes to the public at 9pm every night and, they close the main entrance for security reasons. It could be a coincidence but I’m not sure. Another point that I have to consider is that the Maternity Ward front desk is next to the elevators and exit doors. I didn’t hear any elevator door open nor close and no opening or closing of exit doors either. At 3:30am when everything is dead silent, these are noises you will clearly hear. At least nothing else happened that night.

The next couple of nights where routine and quiet; typically boring. One night everything was fine, I believe she was hovering because I couldn’t see any feet and she was around 50 feet away from me. This lasted somewhere around 30 seconds but it felt like a lifetime to me. After sometime, I got the courage to get up and try to walk towards her. Immediately as I was headed down her way, she disappeared into a fine mist. I was so fucking scared that night; not wanting to be alone in the OR anymore, I went downstairs to the ER to check if they needed help.

Personaly, was 19 at the time ).

We were staying at our friends parents place, it used to be part of the church where the nuns used to stay. I should note I for one am not religous at all and I am sceptical and very logical person.

I don't think I have ever told this to anyone

But to get on with the actual story!

Fast forward, so I was looking at the entrance to the room and close to my feet were doors to the next room where my bro was sleeping.

I was staring through the empty room and then I saw

She started moving towards me, maybe like a game with 5FPS, that is the closest analogy I can come up with.

It occured to me it might be this girl that was staying with us so I called her out, goofing around, laughing/smiling. I should note there was absolutly no sound through this story. She had brown hair.

Anyway, fuck... I was dumbstruck. I called out again ( not very loud, I was freaked out a bit ) "" Is someone there? "" I also reached out trying to touch her, but I couldn't feel or have a grip on anything like she wasn't there.

Then I notice another one

I was too paralyzed ( due to the freak out ) to do anything besides turning myself over facing the wall. I saw another girl - blonde, less then meter away. I realized this because I tried to touch her as well and my fingers just bumped against the wall.

In back of my mind I pondered if I went insane or I had a brain tumour/poisoning from water or whatever and started to hallucinate.

I was still facing the blond girl and I don't know why, buried my face into the pillow, my brain just said to me ""that's it, fuck this I'm out of here"" and shut down. I didn't think, I didn't concentrate, I'm not sure I was even breathing. I just felt presence literally towering all around me and only thought I had was 'I want this to end.'

It lasted few hours I guess then the sun slowly started to come up and soon after that it was all gone.

I thought it all ended with that

A little initial information: my basement is divided into a social area and bedroom to the left of the stairs
I've come to believe the basement to be haunted by an animal
I'm 24 now, and within a few seconds came running back up stairs. Asking what the hell was her problem, she told me ""There's something big down there"". 
At this time, and one pretty small, only about 2 feet high; they don't hang out in the basement. Especially in the storage area. 
So I went down to investigate, i found nothing, and asked her what she saw. She told me she saw a big grey animal pass by her a few feet away through the corner of her eye; interesting, I thought.

Maybe a year passes; still in high school I have a friend over who goes down to grab some ritz bitz sandwiches, there's a hell of a big dog down there"". 
At this point, telling me he saw a large grey animal on all fours walk past near the back of the storage area as he turned the corner. Of course I saw nothing when going down to look.
A few years pass and I'm looking over my parents house one weekend I'm down from college. My only dog has been put in a kennel because they were gone for over a week, I'm woken up by the very distinct sound of footpads on carpet (If you have carpet like an office building or a school, and you have a heavy dog walk across it you'll know the sound). Very interesting, I think to myself. 
So I grabbed a flashlight, all throughout the bedroom and social area and see nothing. I laid back in bed but kept hearing the sound. Eventually I just shouted ""I'm trying to sleep!"" to no avail, all I hear is pacing. I wasn't too nervous or uncomfortable because if the ghost/spirit/animal wanted to have done anything, it would have. So I figure to leave it to pace, and I headed upstairs to my bedroom to sleep.

1374644642.0,1ixu0k,[ME] Midnight Hike,tiyr,24,5,15,"  I ask that you forgive any typos and other such errors. This is the first time I have put my experience into written word but I will try to convey the experience and emotion as accuratley as possible.
  To preface myself, mountains and general solitude of the wilderness. I would not claim myself to be afraid of the dark woods or night time in the mountains, nor am I superstitious in my everyday life however my personal encounters force me to consider a wide and unorthodox realm of what is possible.

  This experience took place on Christmas Eve 2005,  that Christmas we decided to spend a small holiday at home just the 5 of us. Having gotten used to being a very active college student I became restless hanging around the house all day and night. I decided to take a night time hike at a nearby lake. I pack a bag, food for 2 days, a backpack stove and extra winter clothes. The snow at my house was about six inches so I expected at least 2 foot along the trail and I tend to over pack because shit happens when you are least prepared. It was roughly 10pm when I left the house and it took me approx. 90 mins to reach the lake. The lake and forest around it is roughly 8 or 10 miles east of the Navajo Nation as the crow flies. The trail I intended to hike was only 3.5 miles and led to a fire tower. I had hiked this trail a few dozen time since I was 7 or 8, and had become very familiar with a very large portion of the surrounding area. Because of this I expected an easy and uneventful hike to tire me out and ease my restlessness. 

  I pulled into the staging area for the trail head, an instinct hiking pace I have developed. The trail began in a very lightly wooded flat and slowly meandered into a moderately wooded dell that continued for a half mile or so. At this time I knew the switch backs would begin to carrying me up the hill side. I would estimate I was 75 or 80 yards from the first switch back when I noticed I had substantially slowed my pace and caught myself instinctively scanning with area infront of me. This is a posture I usually assume when I am hunting or stalking big game through the forest. After I caught my self the first time I thought nothing of it. The second time I had caught myself doing the same thing was only a hand full of moments later as I was near the second switchback. This time I payed more attention to my gut and kneeled down next to a stump. Up until this time I was using only by petzl headlamp that when on high, as it had been, throws off enough light to carry a beam roughly 50 or 60 yards. As I kneel next to the stump I flip up my head lamps red filter lens and turn the power setting to low then proceed to listen carefully while scannning nearly 360 degrees around me. After 5 minutes or so my eyes adjust better to the darkness and I caught a faint glow of red postioned roughly at the switch back infront me. I decided to sit for a few mintues and continue to observe and listen while my eyes continued to adjust. The faint red glow never really seemed disappear but the intensity seemed to diminish at irregular intervals over those few minutes. I grew impatient and summized there was a trail or survey reflector at the switch back that was catching my red filtered light. By the time I decide to stand up and proceed with my hike  I would guess 10 mins had past.

  As I stood upright I pulled out my medium handheld mag light and flip my headlamp back to high and switch it from red filter to the white LED. It was at this point when my state went from relaxed and calm to a sudden jump in that fight or flight feeling that only an adrenaline dump can produce. My two lights had easly lit up the switch back where I was observing the faint red light however I did not see the reflector I had told myself was the origin of the red glow. As I began the process of controlling by breathing and the feel of panic and slowly step forward with uneasy suspicion I notice a red glow appearing several feet up the hill in front of just beyond the switchback and just beyond the beams of my two lights. Upon controlling my panic I began to try and determine what this glow could be. The best, and never with such a hazy glow. The tales of mountain lions that ran these mountains and reports of a small pack of mexican red wolves in this part of the state made the choice for me to turn around and head back down the trail. I slowly turned around and slowly walked the path I had just come no more than 15 mins before. I thought it was a wise idea to keep my mag light shining behind me with hopes that if this was a predator animal it might think I was still facing it as I retreated.  I had turned the corner and began the slow walk to the base of the switchbacks. Again I got within 30 or 40 yards of the last turn that led to the dell when I saw the glow only this time I made out a distinct set of two red glows with just enough space between the two to make them distinct and seperate from each other. This is when I confirmed it was an animal which put me at easy but also worried me because it did not follow me but actually cut me off on the trail as if it knowingly intercepted me in my retreat. 

  I stood there wieghing my options and risks. I could continue moving forward down the trail and hope the bold move would keep a buffer of at least 20 yards between the animal and myself, it seemed like the way to go. I proceed ed carefully but quickly through the wood and snow on the ground when I reach the bottom and connect up with the trail.  At this point I knew I was a good mile from my truck and it was a flat easy mile, half was through the dell and the last half over the meadow. After only a few quick yards back to the truck my gut told me to stop and turn around. I did just that, I cut of trail a few stew and kneeled next to a smallish pine tree. This time I completely turned of my lamps and listened with an intense concentration. My instinct told me the crust on the snow should break under the foot of anything larger than a rabbit or raccoon. My eyes had only began to adjust to the darkness when I saw the two red glows emerging from where I imagined the last switchback was and clearly but slowly moving away from the hill side. I tried to slow my breathing so I could better hear the foot steps of the animal that seem to be curiously pursuing me. I would guess it had moved a fair amount of distant closer to me and I guess a hundred yards from my position.  It did not seem to move with focused intent on me but did seem to move with purpose. It was hard to judge distants accuratley with such low light so I told myself to stay silent and watch for 15 more seconds. Out of no where my brain seemed to have finally catch on to the fact that I had not heard a single sound since I had stopped, no snow crunching underfoot not even a twig snapping no sound that might suggest any animal moving through the winter night. Along with no sounds I realized the red glow was not the reflection of eyes, there was no light to be reflected from an animals eyes. So I finished my 15 seconds stood up turned and took the few stepz to the trail where I turned my mag light and head lamp full on and proceeded with a quick pass. 

  This is where panic really started and stayed with me. Every 20 or 30 yards I would stop turn around and listen. After the second stop it became clear the two red glows where following me but staying just out of reach of my light beams. As much as I tried to control myself panic continually pushed harder and harder to take control so I began to pick the pace up. What ever it was followed and remained outside of my lights. After several minutes of escalating panic and on the verge of a dead run I could see my head lights lightly reflecting the white LED lighy of my head lamp and I knew I was within 100 yards or safety and escape. But,  so I kneeled down and concentrated.  This time the red glows continued to move slowly closer, I expected they stayed out of my beam which is roughly 60 yards from me so that where I figured they would stay even with my lamps off. No such luck, the pair of close set red glows came just close enough to me that my eyes could not make out a figure, shadow, silhouette or make any distinctions between what they were and the night and the forest. The speed with which the two had closed the 60 yards or so was astoundingly quick and with not a sound to go with it or any other movement you might accosiate with something running at you. I could do nothing but watch in awe as they stopped an begin to grow in intesity. As the intensity grew they elevated themselves from roughly 2 feet off the snow to what I would guess 10 or twelve feet off the snow. Af this point the brightness of each seem to peak at approx. the brightness of a desk lamp. The light shown of the snow, the tree boughs to either side but it  did not seem to shine on objects behind it. After reaching this peak hieght and brightness the two very slowly separated maintaining everything about them except they distance from each other. They finally stopped 6 feet from each other and just as they stopped an third red glow came quickly up behind them and stopped right inline with the original two. I cant say if this third one literally appeared out of no where some where by the base of the hill or if it had came the same route I just traveled but I had noticed it becUse I was so focused on the two right in front of me. How ever it came about I instantly decided the best idea was to get up and book it back to my truck. So I did just that. I ran as fast has I felt I ever had pack and all with no light. I crashed reckless through the snow with a panic driven focus only to get to my truck. When I finally reached my truck I jumped in turned the key and immediately switched on my high beams. The three were still able to stay just out of the beams of my head lights. I backed out and left down the snow packed forest road. My trucks 4 wheel drive was already engaged from the drive in so I drove as quick as I could. After the first mile or so I figured I had left the red glows behind but continued to obsessively check my mirrors.  Then I checked and saw the faint hazy glow of two and when I put my attention back o. the road I saw the third just beyond my high beams. I tried to maintain control of fear so I could maintain control over my truck. They three stayed in their intial positions the 20 minutes it takes to get down the mountain but upon reach the small community at the bottom the simply vanished. They didnt fade away or slowly peel away from me

  At this time I was so relieved I was off the mountain, wake him up but this time around I am able to deliver a more detailed, more concise and less emotiinal account of what happened to me in the previous hour or more. My experience was like nothing he had every heard of before.  By the time our conversation was finished I was still 15 or 20 minutes from home still with adrenaline in my system and no answers. I sat there and thought about it over and over again, when I got home I tried but never slept the night. Christmas day was a a dull passing of hours. I thought only of what had clearly chased me and all the odd and wild aspects of the glowing things that I did truly without a doubt saw. I did not sleep for another 2 nights after that christmas eve. 

  After that night I sought a few people who knew the area very well and asked if they saw or heard about anything odd up there. Some said no and others came up with what seemed to me as the generic ghost stories that happened to the cousin of a friend's friend. I passed these of as nonsense and camptales. So
  I have not returned to that area since thaf night

  If anybody has any theories or guess even suggestions as to what it is

  Thank you for reading and for creating a space where I can finally write this down.

1372376873.0,1h7pk6,[ME][FAM] It's all a lie. Pt 2,Blacklightzero,27,10,33,"My grandmother was widely known as a shrew but she was a saint to me. After my grandfather died she lived on another 6 years.  I got older and had less time for her between work and school and sometimes I onky managed to see her every two weeks even though she lived only a few blocks away. My family fell on hard financial times but even on her fixed income she always made sure I was in want for nothing.

I was 17 when she got sick.  She had an aneurysm in her aorta that surgeons successfully clipped

 She stayed in a coma for a week before she died.  I got off work early and stopped by the hospital before going home. I told her that I loved her and that I realized how much she had done for me and that I wished we had more time.  On my way out of the ward a code blue was announced.  I saw people rushing down the hall as the elevator doors closed.  By the time I got home they had already called and told us she was gone.

We knew she had mixed feelings about her own death. She wanted to be with her husband but she wanted more to be there for me.  

I never lucid dream.  My dreams are strange
My mother and I were sitting at the kitchen counter having a conversation when the kitchen phone rang.  My mom picked it up but she only heard a dial tone.  When she hung it up it began to ring again.  I picked it up this time.

""Hello?""
""Hi J

I was aware she was dead.
""Grandma! How are you...""

""I wanted to talk to you before I left. I'm much happier where I am right now. I'm just fine.""

""Where are you?""

""I'm here.  I haven't left.""

""Is grandpa there?""

""No

My mom was begging to talk to her.
""Grandma

""No

""C'mon

""No! I don't....""

I handed the reciever to my mom.  She put it up to her ear and said ""Mom
A bellowing scream issued from the reciever so loud it hurt my eardrums even though it was up to my mom's ear. (ThinkAphex Twin - Come To Daddy but angrier and screechier)

""Mom? Why?!""

The scream continued.

""Why won't you talk to me!!!""

She dropped the phone
I picked up the phone again.  The scream had stopped.

""I told you not to give me to her. I don't want to talk to that bitch.""

""Why not

""It's your fault.  You should have done what I told you.  I need to talk to you

""Why?""

""I need to tell you some things.  You can't tell your mom.  I can't tell her either.""

""What things?""

I wish I could remember what she said here.  I feel like it was very important and there were seven or eight things she told me.  I have long considered hypnosis to revive the memory but I am afraid to.

When she was finished she said ""I want you to remember how proud of you I am.""

""Thank you.  What is 'the other side'?  Heaven?""

""Do you remember what your grandfather told you?  That it's all a lie?""

""How are you calling me?""

""I have to go.  Its been too long.  Never forget I love you.  Bye bye.""

""Wait! Grandma!""

Click.  The phone call ended.

I woke up in my bed

I walked to the bed and put my arms around her and let her cry on me.  Later we talked about our experience.  We remembered the exact same thing happening.  Both of us had headaches and woke up unusually thirsty.  Apparently there had been some abuse by my grandmother against my mom when she was younger.  The fact that grandma wouldn't talk to her is still a sore spot for my mom all these years later.

A little over a year and a half ago

One night, I know there's something beside my bed, and I just know it's a little boy. Brown hair. Pale. Dark T-shirt. And he's just staring at me in my mind's eye. Without any reason, I know without a doubt that he's standing there, staring at me. And I start bawling because I'm so confused. 

If there had been something there... if I had seen something... I could have at least be terrified. But at that point

Thankfully, and I don't remember ""seeing"" the little boy again until long after I was employed.

1370844992.0,1g1441,[ME] [FR] An experience in the woods at my friend's house,samm157,22,4,24,"So, I thought it would be the perfect place to find out. 

Anyway, house and so was another friend of mine, Lisa. We were bored with nothing to do in the house when Kate got an idea.  

Kate had been getting pictures of orbs (Some of which I have because she uploaded them on my computer.) all down her driveway and in the woods by her house at night and she wanted to investigate. I, who at the time did not believe in the paranormal, tagged along to humor us. 

 So, and mine and Kate’s phones, and then we left Kate’s house to walk down the driveway. She lived on a big piece of land, and it had a very long driveway. We stopped about halfway down the driveway, out of earshot of both houses. (Her grandmother also had a house on the land, but closer to the road). We had to do it this way because her mother was very superstitious about paranormal things. I remember her not even letting us watch movies involving possessions or demons in the house because “That was just asking for something bad to happen.”

Since Kate wasn’t expecting any visitors to the house (And we would’ve been able to see them coming up the driveway long before they reached us even if any showed up by surprise.) we settled down right there on the ground

EVP plans in mind, we played it back. Nothing. 

That didn’t really discourage either Kate or myself, and after a little coaxing, convinced her to be quiet for EVP round two. 

This time we asked a few more questions

This time when we played it back

Feeling that we were definitely on to something, but still not loud enough to be decipherable. 

Kate and I agreed to do one more EVP. This time, saying that there was really nothing there and that all of this was stupid. Kate went along with it because she wanted whatever this thing was to react. I went along with it out of curiosity. What was the worst that could happen, right? 

We played back the recording again and we got the same slightly-louder but still undecipherable whispers from the third EVP. By now Lisa was getting irritating because she was bored

For some reason

She panicked

We’d been looking for it for about five minutes when I saw something that would change my life forever. (This is where things start to get weird.) 

It started out as just a blur in the corner of my eye. At first

I snapped my head up

It was about the size of a large dog (Like I said, but when it (I assume) sensed I had seen it swiveled its head around to stare at me. Except, it couldn’t stare, because it had no eyes. (It seriously reminded me of something from Silent Hill.) Just a wide mouth. It opened its mouth and after a few seconds a terrible growl reached my ears. 

That growl was horrifying. It seemed to reach the core of my soul. It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life

I was still frozen on the spot when, me stunned, Kate and Lisa having no clue what had just happened. 

Kate’s mom was here to get her, I believe. 

Still sort of in shock, and so did everyone else. We all looked at each other and I quickly told them how I’d seen…something, but I kept a lot of the details to myself so I didn’t sound crazy.

 At this point, but torn because she wanted to find her phone. I told her I wasn’t helping anymore, I was sorry, and went and sat on her grandmother’s porch. 

To this day, I will never know. 

I hesitate to call this thing a demon

If it makes any difference, up until at least the 1970’s, and that quite a few people were killed out there. I have no idea if that could possibly have anything to do with what I saw, but it could be what all of the orbs were about. 

So, as everything I just wrote is 100% as I remember it.

1369925402.0,1fc7gh,[ME] Help naming my only paranormal sighting,weirdthrowaway420895,24,4,5,"Throwaway here to share my only paranormal experience. This is perhaps less of a story than an unexplainable sighting. I used to share this with friends after a few drinks but have learned to not speak of it -- for one, here is my somewhat anticlimactic experience.

Fall of 2006 or 2007. I'm on my way home from university for a weekend with the family. The drive home consists largely of paved rural roads through the woods of northern Minnesota. Ditches are well maintained but there are reasonably dense trees and brush just off the right-of-way.

It's night but not pitch-black. Enough to need headlights but still enough light to see the edge of the woods. This is a curvy road which is notoriously underpatrolled

So I come around one of these winding turns and, maybe 50 feet from my car. As soon as my lights shine on it though, it strides gracefully the 20 or so feet into the adjacent woods, and out of sight.

This thing must have been at least 7 feet tall, with no hair, and very thin -- thin enough to see joints. If you imagine a stereotypical ""alien"" figure, you have a pretty good idea. And the way it walked was so graceful, it almost glided. So swift but calm. I didn't catch any facial features in those few moments.

This is all I saw. My mind went into full-on red alert mode after seeing this, but my fear and sense of self-preservation won out.

I've bounced around explanations -- a human, but nothing totally satisfies my curiosity.

I should add as an epilogue (and this is where it becomes certain that I'm really naive or just cracked) that I shared this with my job supervisor -- a guy with a somewhat crappy past that had sometimes alluded to the paranormal -- and he revealed having experiences with the same type of thing. He called them ""watchers"" and assured me that, describing more malevolent entities that had, for a lack of better word, haunted him from time to time.

That's all I have. My question to this community then: is there anything like this described in mythology or other sightings? I should say that I'm a Christian and my explanation has settled upon this being some sort of minor demon

I appreciate your feedback and I appreciate the outlet that this community gives to these sort of experiences.

I lived in a trailer park just off of I-70 in Missouri at the time

This particular night

Down on the treeline there was a shadow, so it looked very similar to those old cartoon wheel when they spun slowly. There were no details; no face, no fingers, no clothes, no feet, but it stood anywhere between 7 to 9 feet it seemed. It vanished into the deeper shadows of the woods.

It was a really nice house. Every teenagers dream with a pool and hot tub in the backyard. The house was a essentially a large rectangular shape. My bedroom being on the right side of the house

Now

So one weekend, and took the curtains down. Originally, I had planned on putting up my pale blue curtains, but something prevented me from doing so for a week. Power drill was broken maybe? I don't remember.

My bed was underneath the window so every night I got to stare up at the stars as I fell asleep. It was actually really cool...until my dad hired a lawn care service and let me tell you waking up to people outside your window trimming the shrubbery and shit was scaring enough. So

That same night, but the sound was....indescribable. I've never heard anything like it before and I hope to never hear it again. 

I had a slider window, catching, and then banging into the glass as it lost it's grip. 

I was begging the glass not to break and at the same wishing the sound would stop. I have never been so terrified in my life and I just completely froze up. It felt like hours of the frantic scratching

When it finally stopped

I finally was able to get out of bed and move to the opposite side of my room

The next morning

I'll never know what was outside my window. I'll also forever wonder what would have happened if I hadn't have put my curtains up the night. Would I have seen the cause for the sound?

Anyway. One day, she didn't know what, but it was dangerous and she needed to escape. The presence cornered her at the end of the hallway on the upper floor, and she was trapped. Just as all hope was lost, there was a light, and she didn't know what it was either but it felt safe. It felt like she was being rescued. She woke up.

Later that day, large heads, small noses, no ears, that sort of thing. Do I personally believe this kind of alien exists? I'd say it's very unlikely that something would independently evolve with all the exaggerated features humans associate with intelligence, but that's beside the point. 

The phone rang. My mom set the book down on the coffee table and went to answer it. On the other end was my grandma, pointed at it, smiled and said, ""I know that."" 

In the book, I suppose, but otherwise it's ambiguous. 

My mom paused, he was referring to the way the book was propped on the table like a tent. ""You know what tents are?"" she asked, but he shook his head.

When I was a kid I was…pretty dark…I had a very strong interest in mythology and the occult. I also enjoyed entertaining some very violent ideas and fantasies

So, movies, documentaries, online archives, any piece of information (or misinformation) I could get my hands on. It started when I was around 11, and I don’t if I was working myself up or if there ended up being some outside influence but sudden I started having these creepy feelings when I was alone, especially when I went to bed at night. There are a handful of instances during this period that really stand out to me (the rest I think really could have been just me.) where I would be lying there just really terrified, not with my eyes open at least, maybe three years. I never told anyone about them because I was scared of how they would react

Anyway, and the summer before starting at my new middle school, my mom decided to surprise enroll me and my sister in a Baptist summer camp. Being the ostentatiously creepy little goth brat that I was, I was naturally pretty pissed.

But, and thought that all of this was a great opportunity to turn over a new leaf and leave all of my dark and creepy BS behind. 

But the creepy BS apparently wasn’t going to go out without a fight.
The afternoon I got home

Until I walked into my bedroom.

As soon as I walked through the door, suddenly there was a weight on my shoulders. Mind, this was my new bedroom, all of the other weird things that had happened, happened in my old house, and I thought I had left those memories behind. I tried to shrug it off and ignore it, I was only in the room to drop off my bags before going off to dinner anyway.

After we returned home it was pretty late, as I lied down and tried to sleep, I couldn't seem to shake this small but persistent feeling of paranoia. I tried to distract myself by focusing on all the good times I had had in the past week. But suddenly the old images seemed to be trickling back, scary images. Naturally this only heightened my feelings of paranoia, but I decided to be proactive, and grabbing a CD of gospel music that I had gotten from a youth pastor. I thought it would work for sure and I would listen to the music and contemplate Christ and get over it!

I was dead wrong. In spite of myself, loud, deep, and unintelligible. Too spontaneous and detached to be something I had consciously brought on. I was terrified. I opened my eyes to tell myself there was nothing there and there seemed to be a subtle flashing over my vision. Like a strobe light. (The lights in my room had been off for some time at this point, I was of course, trying to sleep. The only light that came through the slats of my window was moonlight.) The screaming wouldn't stop, the images wouldn't stop, the strobing became more powerful and my vision became cloudy

That night I had a dream. There was a creature outside in the backyard, and stood on four stubby legs. It was a deep, flat black, that was featureless and seemed almost two dimensional. It had two beady, bright red eyes. It seemed almost comically cute, but there was something about it that made me know that it was somehow dangerous. I went over to where my mother was, and I remember telling her ""Please stay inside, ok?'' I think after a while it must have left. Because I woke up in the morning feeling totally fine. I felt normal, I told no one about the experience until months later

However recently I was with them all and decided to describe my final experience and the dream to them. During high school, sober or otherwise.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,
1354505164.0,146k63,[FAM] The Pyre (xpost from r/nosleep),,23,5,9,"I recently added a very shortened summary of this story in the recent reddit thread: [what’s the most gruesome discoveries you’ve made]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1440ye/i_once_made_a_gruesome_discovery_when_i_opened_a/c79rq8d?context=3)
I’ll start off by saying that my family is Lakota Sioux (Native American, while others have moved across the country. 


A little background of my grandparents: my [grandfather](http://i.imgur.com/JTifD.jpg) (is it just me or does he look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?) did a lot of traveling for a medical company. He always had a camera on him because he took a lot of photographs for medical brochures (some of which included pictures of STDs, but they lived permanently for several years on the Rosebud reservation while spending the summers on Pine Ridge. 


At the end of a weekend trip to Pine Ridge during the early 70s, especially where we live.


Anyways, my grandfather and my mother stumbled upon a roughly built pyre. On top of it was a dead body, wrapped up in some sheets. My mother was pretty young and has some troubling remembering exactly what took place, but she believes he asked her to run back and grab his camera and tell my grandmother while he stayed put.


After she returned, some of my aunts and uncles, and some family friends standing around the pyre, both of which are pictured [here]( http://imgur.com/a/VP5gH#0).

My mother had forgotten about this until very recently. When my grandmother passed away in 2008, she was only aware of the first pyre photo slide at this time**) and called me into our computer room (I’m in college living with my parents) and showed it to me. She said, ""Grandpa and I were out walking on our land one weekend and we just randomly found this. Someone had come onto our land and built it and put that there!"" I didn't realize what was actually on top of it and said, ""Oh, that's cool..."" She gave me a weird look and said, ""German_Jerky... that's a body on top of it."" I was pretty creeped out and asked her several questions afterwards. The first was, what did they do about it?


For those of you who are not aware, and as my mother put it, “There was no way they’d come and investigate something like that!” I asked her if they knew who it was, and she told me that she didn’t, and that if my grandfather or grandmother did, they never mentioned it. I asked her what happened afterwards. My mom told me that they had to return to Rosebud for the next week, and came back to Pine Ridge the following weekend to find that it had been burned. 

That took place about three days ago. Today, and it continued to flicker. She checked the outlet and it was securely in place. All during this time, she was scanning in a batch of slides. The scanner is a black tower with an open slot in it. The slot is for a plastic tray that fits four slides at a time, and runs it through like a printer, scanning each slide. [All of this can be seen in this picture I took of it today.]( http://i.imgur.com/YNU75.jpg) 

When it finished, but it’s a pretty creepy coincidence.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I need to clarify anything.

[Pt.2/My families](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/z48nm/fam_a_collection_of_experiences_pt_2/)


I live with my boyfriends family and they (particularily him) have a few strange stories so I thought I'd post them up for you. These are true


*A quick note on the house*

*My partners parents moved in before their three children, communal bathroom and spare room are at the very end of one side of the house.*


Anyway


**Keys**

When the house was getting it's pool put in the kids used to play in the trench when the workmen went home for the day. This is when they were all about 4


They pried it open and inside were a bunch of really old fashioned keys


They were just a shitty old set of keys

Anyway! The point to this opening story is that nothing bizarre happened in their house until after these keys were found. (Which sounds like the opening to a horror movie!)


**Laundry**

Not long after the keys were found and lost(?) Their laundry door started acting up, ""Right here honey!"" from the laundry so off she trucked to talk to her. When she got to the washroom though there was an old woman standing in front of the washing machine smiling at her. Needless to say she freaked out and ran all the way to her mums room, and of course when they checked it out again nobody was in the room.


From that experience on the youngest sister would often hear a woman calling her name from the laundry and their mother would occasionally find smalls folded or socks paired that no one admitted to doing (and the kids probably would have been just too small to reach up on top of the cabinet we fold clothes on.)


**Mannequin**

This one I find very hard to believe myself but the tell tale trick to see if my boyfriend is telling the truth is to ask him to swear on his mothers life


One day him and Amber were playing in his room before bedtime. He describes that it suddenly got really cold and where he'd been feeling really jubilant before it was suddenly replaced with a heart clenching feeling something wasn't right. For some reason he looked up at the door and stared at it


Jack says that he saw an orange mannequin walk past. It looked like a [wooden man](http://m.cdn.blog.hu/am/amymd/image/pix/jointed-wood-body-form-mannequin-dress-form.jpg) and just went by without looking in or paying any notice of them. After it passed the doorway Amber said quietly to Jack that she felt like something scary had happened and she wanted to see their mum so they jumped up and bolted out of the room together. When they got to her Amber blurted out that she'd heard something really scary. 


**Accident**

This one happened to an aunt of the siblings who lived/s in Perth. One night her daughter (their cousin) went out to a friends house for a birthday party when she was 16. Her mum told her not to be home too late (midnight) because Marie was in her exam period


At around one o'clock her mother started getting worried or annoyed or just plain thirsty and went to get a glass of water. she looked up at the glass sliding door across from her and saw Marie standing there looking at her ""What time do you call this?"" She called out turning back to flip off the tap and then went to let her in through the sliding door.


When she opened the door though she realised that Marie in fact wasn't there, one of her 18 year old friends had taken her and a few others for a joy ride and they'd totaled the car killing them. We all like to think that she was coming back home to say one last goodbye.


That story gives me chills every time I hear it.


**Scotch**

Jumping forward to when Jack was around 17, haha) and he says he can't explain it. It was like an intuitive feeling with mental images bubbling up in his head.


They both went dead silent and without words knew the other was feeling and seeing. What they were. Jason started explaining something about the image he was... receiving? and Jack would finish off his sentences and then start describing the next thing to which Jason would finish off his sentence.


They both agreed that there were a group of men in 1930's clothing drinking scotch and catching up as if they hadn't seen each other for a while. I would have been pretty damn freaked out and the boys were. Our friend Jason thinks he's a bit of a psychic for reasons I haven't really asked him in detail about because I'm pretty skeptical about that sort of thing. Anyway


**Piano**

My boyfriend is a musical prodigy, without a doubt he flipped out and fell off the stool trying to unwrap his feet from it. Of course as per usual after the fleeting glance there was nothing there which could have been put down to a trick of light but he saw her again the week after in the same clothes, same smile, same face.


**Creeper**

This actually happened just last week (which is what reminded me I hadn't posted pt. 3 up of my 'collection' up!)


The other night at about 1am we heard someone on the front porch walking up to the door


When the door didn't open I got scared (because I'm a wimp!) but I didn't say anything because Jack was sitting next to me and if something was off he'd move. But low and behold up he gets, locked the front door and laundry and checked the backyard but nobody was there. So we locked everything up tight, closed windows etc. I've had a prowler in the past so I get really worried about security like that anyway.


We finished our movie and went to bed, just play fighting plus we kept hearing strange noises in the house (Jack checked the house a couple of times) so we didn't start to go to sleep until about 2:30 Anyway at about 3-4 am the family dog started freaking out. I got super worried because waking up out of my dreamy state it sounded like Kiera coming up from downstairs screaming or crying.


Jack and I bolted up and ran out


When I got back into the room as soon as I shut the door and sat in bed this strange scratching noise started in the room, but this moved so fast from one side to the other it was unlike anything I had ever heard in the wall before. It definitely wasn't a possum because we've never heard a possum in the wall and I haven't heard anything since anyway.


The next morning we spoke to Kiera and she said she'd closed her bedroom door but in the morning it was open


There's probably logical explanations for it all


Anyway. That's the full collection of my creepy stories. Looking back at it in text form there's quite a few. I hope someone enjoys them :)

Now this is an old story that happened many years ago in my hometown. 

I live in a quiet little town with a whole lots of woods and montain areas cut by deserted dirt roads. One hot summer night, talking and just being on vacation... 

So, etc... The thing is: half an hour later they came back to the bar, their faces pale as a white wall, shaking and just plain scared shitless. 

The whole bar stopped and looked at them asking what had happened and they couldn't even speak. The girl just burst out crying and my father and some of their closest friends went to the bar's kitchen to know what happened to them. They said they were close to the old chapel and that was when they started seeing lights bathing the car
He looked around and there was blinking lights and shapes coming in their direction from the woods

They just kept going 'till they got back to the bar. They calm themselves and assured my father and their friends it was true. A couple of minutes two friends went to check the guy's car. It was covered in dust from the dirt road. Close to the door handle and in the roof of the car there were marks of long fingered hands

When the guy who saw the lights arrived at the table, too. He said that he was one of the two who went to check the car. He wipe the imprints off and never told him about it.

When she was in her late teens, and her mother moved into a house in the city (don’t want to be overly specific, but it’s a rather historic city in MA.) As soon as they saw the place, she and her sisters immediately gave their mom strange looks. Why? Well, there were all sorts of religious paintings and pictures all throughout the house. Lots of them. And….sevens. The number 7. Scrawled on the walls, sevens fashioned out of wood and even nailed TO the walls—they were even, she said, the previous tenant was highly religious so they left it at that

So they settle in and go about their lives, of a man with a long, pointy nose wearing a large, floppy hat. This got to the point where it frightened her so much that she just stopped sleeping in the room entirely. Later, she mentioned that the shadow would appear frequently, but on specific nights. I’ll get back to that in awhile.

The next thing she said that stood out was the day that she was helping her mother pack some things. They were downstairs in a room, tugged the underside of her hair just enough so that her head tilted slightly. Naturally, her reaction was “Ow! Mom!” but her mother hadn’t pulled her hair. They even woke up the sleeping fellow to question him about it and obviously he had no idea what they were talking about. 

The third thing she mentioned was what got me. She was laying on her stomach in bed with her feet dangling off the side, and the third sister on the other side of the house with her headphones in, intently writing music. None of them could have done it, the shoes she was wearing weren’t the type that just fall off. 
She mentioned that most of the activity, she took it as “oh, well, I better not go to church, then,” even though her mother was the religious type and insisted when she relayed the experiences that she ought to go. I feel that this is significant with the sevens and all the religious portraiture around the house. Maybe whoever lived there before them felt like they needed to be protected from something. That’s the vibe I get, anyways.

I don’t think this girl was lying about anything. She seemed legitimately rattled as she told me what had happened in that house

“When people talk about ghosts and stuff, I sort of believe, sort of don’t believe, mostly don’t, but then I realize that I’m that weird person with ghost stories too. My sisters said they had some stuff happen too, but we don’t know what was up with that house.”

1333980529.0,s0s7y,Strange power surge [me],robmneilson,21,4,9,"This is my first post in this subreddit

So let's set the scene with a long rambling story! I'm hanging out at my friend Mike's house, and about a week before the day I was hanging out there he did some sort of ritual in the backyard that involved a cows skull. In the ritual Mike drew a circle in salt or something to protect everybody, and my one friend swore that he saw a wolf outside the circle. I just ignored this, since this one guy was prone to making shit up. We did this sort of stupid shit all the time due to growing up in suburbia and not doing drugs like normal kids. 

Anyway Mike, and then amp up to full power and back again. 

We start freaking out, but not overtly scared so I tried to scare Gina when we were exploring the rest of the house. Every room that had a light on was doing the same thing...and there was no sign that it was stopping.

For some reason we decide that it's from the cow skull Mike used in the ritual, where the staff probably hates us since all we order is coffee and stay for hours. 

Now the next day Mike got yelled at by his Dad big time. They had a little side apartment on their house that they rented out to keep the property taxes down. The tenant (who I remember being a pain in the ass) complained that we were being extremely loud. Apparently there was no power surge in his side of the house

This isn't so much a typical [1] /r/nosleep story as it some ""odd.."" things that have been happening for the past few weeks, I have no idea really. Bare with me as I may ramble a bit.

It started about 3 weeks ago at around 3:30am, it was that startled awake feeling you have when you're having a dream and you fall off a cliff but the second you are about to hit the ground you spring awake to that fully aware state. I know for a fact I never had one of those dreams or anything that would have woken me up, as far as i remember there was no dream to speak of, either way I was awake and there was nothing putting me back to sleep. So I laid there for a bit watching TV thinking about something to do that didn't involve getting up and leaving bed, my wife was still asleep at the time and I didn't want to wake her up playing video games, then I got pretty hungry and decided I should go get something to eat. Now this is where everything went downhill, I got out of bed and got dressed but as I opened the door I felt...odd, not with hate or anything just like you kind of stare at the hipsters in the mall thinking ""wtf is wrong with these kids today?"" I just went about my business being very aware of the feelings and not letting them get the better of me. I didn't really feel like cooking anything at that hour so I decided I would go get a sandwich down the road at Tim Horton's. I got in the car backed it into the alleyway

I started my way down the road but still couldn't shake the feeling of someone watching me, so I immediately snapped my head around to see what the hell was in my car, but there was nothing. My mind jumped right to rationalizing the situation and said it must have been something in the back (I drive a Jeep so the trunk is not actually a trunk and the backseats have removable headrests) but then I looked in the rearview mirror and there's nothing that could be confused with what I saw. At this point I'm losing it, but the thing was not there so I played it off as nothing, I was out for about 45 minutes after and saw nothing appear in the mirror again. When I arrived home again I parked back in the alley and started for the back gate, the fence stands about 5 foot tall in the back so I can see over it very clearly, when I got inbto the backyard I had this stupid feeling that I should turn around, and what I saw turned my hair white because I've never been privy to such experiences in my life. But what I saw in the front seat of my car was a person, and it was all made clearer by the dimming lights in the car as they stay on for a minute after locking up. I stared at this ""person"" for the entire minute those lights were on to make sure

A week after this incident I went back to work, as the lights are never on and we have to check every floor of the building even the shitty dark corners. When I went in that night I was pretty uneasy about it all as I'm the only person on duty in a completely vacant building, but I had to work. I started checking the building at around 2:30am, and everything seemed rather normal to me, I was a little dodgy but nothing out of the ordinary happened. Then at around 3:15am or somewhere around there I got to the 15th floor and things got weird again. A few of the floors had lights that you can operate manually while others have timers, the 15th had manual controls so the lights were on the entire time on the floor. It started with innocent noises, like someone was walking behind me the whole time, I kept telling myself that it was just the ccarpet and my shoes. Then I would see things moving in offices as I passed by their frosted floor to ceiling window divides.

""Nope

Well once again I couldn't have been more wrong because after coming to the end of this corridor I took the turn to go down the other side of the building and there it was, like two cowboys waiting to draw pistols, we stood there for what felt like 30 minutes at least, then it just stepped sideways out of view into the office. I'll be honest I never bothered to go see where it went I just thought to myself.

""It's down there

I walked off that floor and sat in the well lit lobby for the rest of the night looking at cute kitten pictures over on [2] /r/aww to try and draw my attention away from that feeling of that thing staring at me. This continued like this for the next week at work, it would just stare at me then go away, to some this just isn't scary but the way it looked just sent chills down my spine every time. I have see that thing maybe 5 more times since in different places, even saw it once downtown in the middle of the day, just staring at me, the last encounter was about a week ago now. But I'm sure it is still watching, studying

Now I'm sure reading this it may not seem like it is overly scary, but I also thought that nothing like this has every really happened to me, and as long as nothing bad happens then I can tick it off the bucket list.

The house is located in a mid-sized city in Southwestern Ontario. He was separated from his wife and needed someone to help out with the mortgage while they sorted their affairs out, so eventually I figured ""All right, what the hell, I'll do it.""

My friend had spoken before of hearing footsteps when alone in the house, he died of old age), a tough old bird who had been a Colonel in the Army, then a principal at a local school upon his retirement from the Forces. His initials and a date (June 1955) were carved into a door frame in the basement. Because of my own previous experiences I was inclined to believe him, but had never heard anything there myself - until I moved in. Within weeks, I was occasionally hearing deliberate footfalls creaking across the upstairs hall, bangs and knocks on the walls, but not always. It was a bit unnerving at times

When winter came a few months later, the disembodied sounds and aforementioned disturbances began to occur at an increasing rate, and they grew both louder and stronger. Especially at night, usually around two in the morning, when I was trying to freakin' sleep.

It goes without saying that I was getting weirded out by this shit. It was extremely disquieting, the closet door then slamming shut behind ... it. I could explain away creaking floors and far-away thumps no problem, but those were fucking FOOTSTEPS, loud and clear and unmistakable. They had weight behind them. Remember, I was all by myself in the house when this stuff was happening. Often, I was scared into gooseflesh and involuntary shivers, and sleep was a long time coming. At the same time, footfalls, ask him to please stop

Bad idea? I wasn't physically afraid of the presence, shape or form a ghost hunter or paranormal investigator, and I wasn't about to run around the house late at night with a sound recording device and camera, asking generalized questions in an effort to communicate with an ethereal being. I just wanted some piece and quiet at night, and to not be scared shitless quite so regularly.

During one particular eventful April evening, systematically searched the house for ... I don't know exactly. Something. I found that a fair number of small items had been knocked to the floor around the house, and (this was eerie) a very old, very rusted pen knife with a fake pearl handle on the stairs leading up to the attic. I had been up in the attic not long before and didn't remember seeing it there, laying open on the middle of the first step. I decided to not go up there, put the pen knife down where I found it and went to bed, muttering to myself and to the Colonel about being tired

I awoke the next morning a sad, I proceeded to curse out the Colonel righteously. I ended my tirade to the empty hall with, "" - so fuck right off, Colonel!"" I went to the bathroom, took a piss, came out and started down the stairs. When my foot hit the second stair two things happened at once - the chandelier hanging at the bottom of the stairwell shook and chattered, and something gave me a hard push between the shoulder blades. I pitched forward face-first, half-grabbed it and tumbled on my side down most of the stairs. The wind was completely knocked out of me

Upstairs, then shut again hard.

I can't describe to you the sheer panic that slammed into my heart, but I lurched up to my feet and limped to the front door and went out to where the sun and fresh air and sanity was, on the front porch. It was briskly cold and a strong breeze was blowing, but I laid myself down in a patch of sun, semi-concealed from the street by the skeletal arms of the bushes that grew around the big wooden porch. I curled up there in my underwear until I stopped shaking from the fear and started shaking from the cold. I decided to convince myself that I had slipped. I did this because I had to; I had no where else to go at this point, and in the slanting sunlight it was easy to talk myself out of the idea that a ghost had just tried to do me grievous bodily harm.

When I went back inside, Colonel."" Then I had a look at my bruises, and had a hot bath. Nothing else happened that day, and that night I forked out money to sleep at a crappy little hotel. When I came back the next day (sore and throbbing all down my left side) nothing was amiss in the house, and after that the activity quickly subsided back down to ""aw, that was just the wind"" type levels.

I tried not to think about what had happened to me on the stairs that morning.

In April my friend got back from the Caymans. A few months after that, but I never told him about being shoved down the stairs by the Colonel. I saw no point in scaring him like that. I reasoned that my antagonistic mouth and vulnerable position of being alone was what had precipitated the act, anyway. However, I sometimes found myself daydreaming this scenario; my friend arriving home and opening the front door to find my rotting corpse sprawled at the bottom of the stairs, neck broken, swollen filmy eyes bulging ...

Oh, the pen knife that I had found on the first stair was gone.

1326496938.0,og3r0,[ME] The shadow hand.,,18,1,2,"So this is happened when I was about 12 years old I think? I'm not sure but I was possibly younger. My brother and I shared a room and we had a computer in the house. We played Quake 3 and it was pretty fun.

I watched him play with bots while i sat on the bed which was closest to the computer. The computer was beside the doorway so it was visible to see part of the living room (lived in a pretty small house).

In the living room a light shone on the wall directly opposite to the bedroom doorway. The thing I had a habit of doing was looking outside the room to reassure myself nobody was watching (or sometimes to look out for my parents because we were up at 3am playing vidya). Basically it was just a habit. This time it was different as I saw a shadow of a hand in the light that shone on the wall that was opposite to the bedroom doorway.

The hand looked like it was wearing a long sleeve but all I saw was half of the forearm. I FROZE and just watched it. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was just moving around like twisting in a natural movement like how you would move your hand around in the sun when you feel like you need to dry your hand (I dont know if anybody else does this but it feels good). My brother saw it

My brother told me in the morning that it was a branch because he checked after i fell asleep but i know that he's lying because it clearly looked like a hand. It disappeared when my father got out to use the bathroom and came back afterwards when he was back in his room. I fell asleep after watching it for a while. I closed my eyes and pretended it wasn't there and I fell asleep.

1325266116.0,nwfd3,Get back to the road,Ensifearthem,21,1,11,"I'm writing this on my netbook from my friend's living room. The current time is 11:20 a.m. I'm seventeen years old and I live in Toronto

I and a lot of my friends are nature lovers, if one follows the main trail, is my other friend's house. For the sake of clarity, we'll call him Allen. We spend a lot of our time in the woods when I'm in town, and it's not unusual for us to disappear inside for hours at all hours of the day and night. Often we'll make campfires in a fire pit in the open clearing near the centre of the forest. It's technically illegal, but we're safe about it and I think it's mostly tolerated.

The forest is fairly large and comprised of both deciduous trees and evergreen trees. It's a pretty fair mix. In certain places the forest is very swampy, even at night. It's always felt like a very safe, peaceful place. We rarely encounter other people, and when we do it's usually dog walkers during the day.

Besides Allen and Ian, I'll call him Lewis. We'd stayed at Ian's the night before last (Wednesday) and then Thursday morning had trekked through the woods in the daylight to Allen's house. By the time we had made it through, Allen and I were exhausted and we realised that we were both ill with a cold or something. We had fevers and just took it easy and rested for the afternoon at Allen's house while Lewis and Ian went for a walk. By around six o'clock we decided he wanted to head back to Ian's (Allen's house is very small and we don't usually stay there overnight) and thankfully Allen's mum was on her way out anyway, so she offered to give us a ride. We arrived at Ian's and ordered a pizza. Wednesday night had been bitterly cold and there was a fair amount of snow, so we weren't certain if we wanted to go out into the forest, especially with how Allen and I were feeling. 

We were sitting in Ian's basement, I was getting stir-crazy and felt like I was up for a walk, even if we didn't walk all the way through.

So at about 11:30

I believe in spirits. There's not really an easy way to sugar-coat that. I think there are certain things beyond the kenning of humanity. Are they quantifiable by science? Perhaps. But not right now. I think some people have a more astute ability to tune in to things like that, but beyond that the forest has never seemed like a threatening or unsafe place.

I don't scare easily. I'm not afraid of the woods or of the night outdoors, different and a bit nightmarish as soon as we walked in. I have extremely poor eyesight, even with my glasses on. I'm nearsighted so I only really have trouble with far away, and since it's normally so dark in there, I didn't even bother putting my glasses on. With or without glasses, I have awful night vision and usually rely on my friends for keeping an eye out for me. Probably because of my bad eyes, I have the best hearing out of anybody in the group.

We got about 10 minutes into the woods. Lewis and Allen were farther ahead of Ian and I. All was quiet, I stopped to take a piss and to switch off my music. Normally we listen to black or folk metal when we walk around in the woods at night, but today I just felt sort of unwelcome. Unwelcome is the best way I could convey it. I felt like we were being watched, and there were just really profound bad vibes coming from every direction. I felt like playing music, even something soft like folk music or ambient would just be inappropriate, like shouting in a library. I'd never felt like this in those woods before. I didn't say anything when we first entered, which is unlike me since I'm prone to trusting my gut above all else. 

I stopped to piss and just as I was undoing my fly I caught something above the din of the music coming from my telephone. I froze and shut it off and turn and motioned for Ian, trying in vain to keep my eyes peeled. They turned and walked back to where we stood. We asked them if they had heard what we did, and they shook their heads. Then we heard it again, closer this time. It didn't sound human, nor did it particularly sound like any animal I've ever heard, though it could have been a coyote. Though if it was a coyote, why hadn't the deer moved? I could still spot their sillhouettes if I squinted; they weren't more than 40 metres or so away. 

Like I mentioned before, as if I didn't belong there.

We finally made our way out, and that was all the notice I needed.

**Tl;dr** Went for a trek last night in the woods on the edge of my friend's town; something wanted us gone.

I believe I've already established that my mother lived in what was almost like a medieval place. Her village in Galicia, everything was dark when the sun set, no one had cars, really, etc. In fact, many parts of Galicia still live like that, particularly in the mountains. There are still oxen with wagons to carry the harvest, that stuff.


Galicia is known for it's 'witch' history. Even after the Romans came, people were much more superstitious, believed in witches and all that stuff. They descend from the Celts, so you get the gist.


So needless to say, days of the dark, was an everyday thing. Very fascinating stories from that time period.


This one in particular was when my mother was about 12 or so. One of her cousin's, but my mom and her mother decided to pay a visit, since they were family. Nothing serious, just dropping by for a chat, something very common in small villages like that.

Catholic Teachings on Ghosts

A look at the concept of ghosts from a Catholic perspective:


Introduction

The subject of ghosts and the paranormal is one that interested me as a kid, for God all things are possible), however the Christian eschatological sense seems to introduce some doubt. We wonder what reasons God may have for allowing a deceased human soul to return to our world, or more troubling still, a damned soul. Such questions require first a strong faith in the teaching authority of the Church, and second an unshakable belief in God's goodness, even when we may not understand His actions.
I will begin by quoting a passage from Exorcism and the Church Militant by Rev. Thomas J. Euteneuer. While I'm very troubled by the rumours I've heard regarding his conduct


Exorcism and the Church Militant
Pages 103-104:
""Most pagan societies believe in the separation of the soul from the body and an afterlife. This includes the idea that souls may ""linger"" after death due to ""unfinished business"" such as unbroken attachments to the earth
""The Roman Catholic belief is categorically different from these pagan beliefs, for Catholics there is no such thing as a ""lingering"" or ""wandering"" soul who has ""not cut the bonds of this earthly life."" For Catholics, there is another way to explain these things than the standard pagan reasoning.
""A strong theological tradition recognizes that deceased human souls can and do visit the living after death for various reasons and in various modes. It is clear that this is only done ""according to the disposition of Divine providence"" and not as a common occurrence. St. Thomas Aquinas says that ""separated souls sometimes come forth from their abode and appear to men..."", redeemed souls). He also claims that souls may appear to others ""in order to seek our suffrages"" (i.e., souls in purgatory). Such apparitions can also be due to a special intervention into the human sphere by a demon creating a deception or an angel appearing in human form to communicate a message.
""Some people call these various apparitions ""ghosts."" In light of the tradition above, if such appearances happen, they are always limited and marked by truth, simplicity and utter clarity to distinguish a holy apparition from a demonic one, which is always marked by confusion, discord, chaos, there is no strictly theological basis for believing that there are souls ""wandering"" around in the world communicating with loved ones
""What has been absolutely forbidden by the Church from the beginning is the attempt to conjure deceased souls from the grave or to communicate with the dead
Rev. Euteneuer goes on to speculate as to whether or not a damned human soul could possess a living person in the same way that a demonic entity is able to do
I think we can condense his answer into a few key points.

Judgement after death is immediate.
God can allow
These scenarios should be considered irregular and rare.
We are not to seek out deceased souls with satanic magic.

It will be useful from here

Catechism of the Catholic Church
1021-1022

1021 Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either accepting or rejecting the divine grace manifested in Christ. The New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the final encounter with Christ in his second coming
1022 Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his death
 So we can conclude from these that if we living beings find ourselves interacting with a deceased human entity, or it may be a saved soul. Of the souls of the saved, it may be undergoing purgation, in which case it is in need of our prayers, or it may be a member of the Church Triumphant, and therefore be able to intercede for us with the power of the saints.

We can conclude now that ghostly/paranormal activity is a possibility from a Catholic point of view


Hauntings

From my previous reading of anecdotal 'evidence' [read: ghost stories]

Good entities
Evil entities
Poltergeists
Benign/neutral haunted houses
We will examine each in turn.

Good Entities:
I think we may conclude safely that these are the least problematic of any category of paranormal activity. These must be either souls in purgatory or in heaven, and of course we must remember that it is not for us to understand the will of God. A hypothetical scenario which occurred to me is that of a father who became estranged from his son, and returned briefly after death to offer and receive healing and forgiveness. I recall Fr. Gabriele Amorth writing about a nun who was visited by a recently deceased member of the same order who begged for her prayers, and eventually her prayers led to the deceased nun's completion of purgation. However, I cannot find this story to reproduce it here in more detail, because I don't have the time to reread both his books.
A soul already experiencing the beatific vision may also be sent by God, ultimately to inspire or strengthen our faith and resolve. We know that they have no need to complete any 'mission'. They cannot have 'unfinished business', because they have been perfected and are conformed to Christ. Maybe we can even consider the same father from our previous hypothetical who, having finished his purgation, returns to console his son during a crisis of faith later in life.

Evil Entities:
This category is also simple. We can quite safely say that if a deceased human entity intends harm for we who are living, the souls of the damned live eternally in their sin; they know nothing but. Were a damned soul to temporarily visit the world of the living, we should conclude that it has been sent by Satan, but permitted by God, in the same way as demonic activity. We know also that these souls remain damned, as their judgement is final and eternal.
The extent of the influence of these damned souls may certainly be debated. It is, with our limited perspective, to distinguish between a damned human and a demon. This is simply because demons are wicked liars and would not hesitate to pose as a human if they perceived any benefit in doing so. Likewise it is reasonable that a damned soul might imitate a demon in hopes of intimidating a member of the living. Later in this post I will speculate further on this subject.

Poltergeists:
Poltergeist activity, but mainly benign.
According to Fr. Herbert Thurston, page 2)
""A poltergeist is simply a racketing spirit, [...] in the course of which the human spectators are occasionally hit by flying objects, but as a rule suffer no serious injury.""
He says further that particular aspects of the poltergeist are
""the invisibility of the agents, if unconscious, mediumistic powers.""
Interestingly

In fact, page 160-161)
""Charismatics and Sensitives
""I mention both although we mistakenly tend to lump them together as one.

Charismatics have received a particular gift, which is to be used for the good of the entire Church, and not for their own personal benefit,
Sensitives
Certainly, but again, I'm unable to track it down at the moment. His treatment of the phenomenon was, as I recall, more or less identical to the quote above from Fr. Thurston.
On the subject of Poltergeists
""Although, notable in such a case as that of the Ketkar household at Poona, I have no thought of contesting the fact that nothing more purposeless- one might say, nothing more childish- could be imagined than these incomprehensible displays of some Puck-like spook bent on every exasperation form of mischief. In the words of Alice in Wonderland, ""he only does it to annoy, because he knows it teases."" Nevertheless, these phenomena seem to me to have their value as a proof of the existence of a world of spiritual agencies, for they are solid and still to be seen; but who has thrown them? Crockery, but witnesses declare that they stood by and saw that no human hand came near them. Now it would be a very violent supposition to maintain that any human being is so psychically endowed that by taking thought he can make material objects external to himself fly about in eccentric paths, though this solution cannot
""It may be admitted in any case that nothing could be conceived more purposeless or irrational than the vagaries of the poltergeist. None the less, or indeed generally, effective in putting and end to poltergeist disturbances, though they sometimes produce a temporary mitigation. On the other hand, I have come across a few cases in which a special novena or the saying of Mass seems definitely to have got rid of the nuisance.""
I will submit then, at least not in a direct sense. In more unusual poltergeist cases which do not follow the common script, such as cases where prayers of exorcism are effective, where serious physical or spiritual harm occurs, or where evidence of witchcraft presents itself, it is rather easier to infer the presence of demonic activity. If we are to accept my conclusions, then we will reject these as being not true poltergeist activity, though annoying poltergeist.
What then would cause poltergeist activity? Referring back to Fr. Amorth I will suggest that, etc., the focal point of a poltergeist creates a sort of disturbance in the physical world due to his unconscious link to the spiritual world.
As for the reasons for this, who thrashes and moves without really understanding how he does it. The mediumistic individual may have a poorly-understood access to the spiritual aspects of Creation, yet does not realize or understand how to control his particular form of control.
We recall also that poltergeist activity seems to be more common in young people. I am reminded of Jesus' call to ""let the little children come to Me""

Benign/Neutral 'Haunted Houses'
I finally have come to the last category of paranormal activity, of course, that inanimate objects may be infested by the demonic. This could be from curses, or from previous satanic activity, or (I think it is reasonable to assume) prolonged contact with someone severely afflicted by the demonic.
However, namely that they are only allowed to return for brief periods. (See, for instance, Summa Theologica Supplementum, Q. 69 Article 3) We may answer this by remembering that God's time is not our time, so what seems to be a perpetually haunted house is still only a temporary state for the deceased soul.
More troubling with the cases of haunted houses is the apparent purposelessness, we know it must be for some greater purpose. In the case of haunted houses, it appears more often than not that the entity does not interact with any living parties
I have heard two complementary explanations for the presence of haunted houses that I will share now. The first is that the classic haunted house is inhabited by the soul of a person in purgatory
The second explanation addresses the apparent purposelessness of hauntings, that some aspect of their purgation involves time on earth, mostly in isolation. I am considering for instance, a person who, though in a state of grace, was so attached to his house that he must be rid of this attachment to be free of the inclination to sin. Maybe his primary purpose on earth is to rid himself of this attachment, and secondarily
Though I covered it elsewhere, psychological, or even physical harm, then it is almost certainly a demon masquerading as a soul in purgatory.
I will note finally that I consider many so-called haunted houses to be explainable by natural reasons. Some recent research has shown that certain frequencies which are below our ability to detect can cause sympathetic vibrations in the body that simulate feelings of dread, as well as old electronics, etc..

 So the city we live in has a lot of woods. In fact
One group of my friends were in one of the parks at night cutting through the woods on the way to a party. It started raining so they decided that as late as it was, they heard a snap. A fuckin' LOUD snap, as if someone had ripped a branch off of a tree. 

At this point everyone was a bit freaked out but just kept going anyway. Next they started to hear thumping and started running. Once they broke the wood line they heard a full blown crash and turned while running to see a dark creature

As I heard this story I thought of a kid I knew to be a ""weirdo"". I now know this kid was actually a Wiccan, this worried me a bit. So I flat out asked him ""What do you know about Ryan, Josh and Paul's story?"" (fake names, I don't want my friends real names used.) At that point he said that if we were to talk about this, we had to leave the park as it was ""a trangression"". I didn't know what the fuck he was talking about but I followed him. We eventually made our way out of the park and he told me that they were ""corrupted guardians"" of the Native American tribes that used to live here way back in the day. The guardians, as he called them were once good but have become evil now. He said he didn't know why, or how, but he said that he didn't really believe them because he ""would have known"" had something really happened. 

I let it go and time went on. Somehow one winter night me and my friend Ryan got on the story talking in his kitchen one night. As he told me of his other experiences, I've never seen him cry from pain or loss, ever so I thought it odd and it made me believe him. I remember asking him if he would take me to the place where his first encounter he ever had was, and he agreed. He warned me to wear a pair of his boots, because he knew it was going to rain. I told him it wasn't gonna rain, if anything it was gonna snow. He just handed me some boots and I just went along with him. 

We got to the woods and I realized that these were woods where I'd had my own experiences. I remember that in these woods I found a dead cat as a child and once when I had thought about killing myself I came here. These woods were BAD. Creepy, sleet, icy rain, or hail. RAIN. This scared me a bit but we decided to push through and investigate. These woods were creepy because in the middle of this clearing there is a perfectly circular ring of trees, around a man-hole sewer grate, that are ALWAYS DEAD. Always have been. Dead in the summer ever since I was 7 years old, and at this point I was 17. That didn't surprise us though because we'd both known that it may have had something to do with the sewer system. We walked through the wooded hill near the clearing, and back down coming to stand in the middle of the circle of dead trees. After standing there we noticed that the two trees inside the circle make an arch. Then we heard twigs snapping. After a minute we heard branches breaking in THE EXACT PATH we had walked. At that point we were scared and had decided to leave the woods because no matter even if that was just a bum

At that point we ran. We just knew to get the fuck out of there. I was NOT playing around with that shit. As we ran, the rain let up. We were nearly home before we noticed that it wasn't raining out here, it was snowing. We sat down and dried off, and started thinking about what happened. 
Whatever those things were, and darkness. There are always all three of them around. Every time we even bring them up, it's either already raining and we don't notice, or it starts raining. One time during a summer drought when we went back there, it was soaked. Everything was wet as if it had just rained. I know there's a sewer line but it doesn't come up that high and the trees had rain on them. It's the strangest thing. 
I can't explain what those things are but if you guys want a few more experiences I will be willing to share with you. I have 2 more to tell you about. Thanks for reading

We eventually polished off the bottle and we all had a great time. I was feeling a little bit hot, so I went outside to cool off. Being close to the shore usually gives a nice breeze, so I headed for there.

While being completely intoxicated, and I start walking up and down the beach. This is during the summer time, so the high benches where a life guard sits were out. And I can remember having the feeling that I could fly. So I decided to climb up one to jump off of. When I got to the top, I had realized someone was already sitting there starting at me.

She looked very beautiful and very attractive (although I was under the influence of alcohol, browns, and dark grays. We ended up talking for a while. What we talked about I can’t truly remember, but some things did stick out in my mind. Unfortunately, not her name.

We talked about how good, which I was excited about. I quickly switched topics to something I can only remember saying the words “fun in the sun”, which I have no idea what I was spouting out. All I could really focus on was ‘not anymore’. Towards the end of our conversation I asked where she lived. I truly believe that she said “At the end of Cove Street” (a dead end road on the shore close to where I live). I somehow smooth talked her and leaned in for a kiss.

At this point, but only 1 house was at the end of it. The house was in pieces. Burn marks were all over the walls and the grass was very overgrown. My friend said that maybe I was dreaming it, in that they found me passed out. But it was just so vivid, so real. It wasn't a dream to me.

It's now home to a car manufacturing plant and a nature reserve. Most of this 2, which wouldn't surprise me as I live in the southern USA and the cemetery could easily be over 200 years old) Well


It was around 9 PM, a machete (you never know when you'll need one in the woods) and a few flashlights. In addition to the flashlights, I was carrying a massive spotlight that I had bought specifically for exploring in the woods at night. It was just my friends James, Dustin, Richard and myself. We were all geared up and so we set out on our adventure. To get to the trails, you have to walk through maybe a mile of neighborhood roads. We were all 18 at the time, so legal curfew was no concern to us. However, all the while we were chatting about girls


It only took about 15 or 20 minutes on the trails for us to run into whatever was waiting there. Our destination was originally the cemetery, saying he feels like his energy was drained. (He's not a very physicaly fit guy, so we understood.) I handed him a snack and a water bottle and we just relaxed at the bottom of the large hill for 5 minutes. Suddenly my friend Dustin says he saw something at the top of the hill, almost like somebody hiding in the bushes that are up there. He and James decided to go check it out, taking the spotlight and the machete with them. I volunteered to stay behind with Richard. After 5 minutes of them investigating, they came tearing down the hill screaming about something. 


I nervously asked them what the hell was going on and they replied ""There was something in the bushes, never coming out. They also said that if they tried to get near it, it would almost teleport into a further away shadow or bush.


The look on their faces told me that it was no joke so we got the hell out of there and rushed our way toward the neighborhood, who knows? We were too scared to find out what it wanted.


We finally made it back to the neighborhood and were nearly running home....the thing is still following us. Out of no where


We were about half way home when James and Dustin say ""There's two of them. We just saw one in front of us."" This scared me even more


We continued, ominous ""mist"" of some sort that seemed to always be behind us, blocking any light behind it. We stopped, held hands, and said a quick prayer. The black mist seemed to weaken a little, eventually disappearing as we passed a church that's right up the road from my house.


The two black figures scared me, made me feel as if I were its prey.




A few months later, for the majority of the time. When we took a rest break about half-way to the cemetery, Dustin put his hat down on the ground, top-up. We continued on, but he forgot about his hat. We were finally returning from the cemetery when I realized he had forgotten his hat and that it wasn't where he left it. We just continued on because he said he could get another. Half-way between where we rested this time and where Dustin and James originally saw the black figure, we found his hat. In the middle of the trail, updside down. The hat wasn't crumpled like someone had dropped it, turned it upside down,,
1375600241.0,1jo5g1,[FR/ME] Prequel to my rehab experience,bassrose,20,3,7,"A few people asked on my [original post](http://redd.it/1jmvbb) to share what else I knew about the building

Let me just start off by going into more detail on the building itself. As I mentioned in my first post, and a different rehab. I've tried to research plenty into the documented history of the building but had no luck. 

What I have gathered from different people, except for maintenance guys. I spook to a few guys that had been in there, and all of them told me they believed it was haunted. I think the reason the unit I was in had so much activity, was because had been the emergency room when the building was the hospital.  

Now on to the spooky stuff. Most of this comes from a guy

Evan was a very religious guy who strongly believed in spirits, they learned that basically, there was spirits all throughout the building. No surprise there. He discovered there were 3 main spirits that lingered in our particular unit while the rest seemed to stay in the closed down area or the church. 2 out of the 3 spirits were evil. The other one was just harmless and tended to linger in the boy's group room while the other 2 jumped around. I can confirm this completely aligns with my personal experiences. I know I saw with complete certainty one of the malevolent spirits (as detailed in first post). Evan also claims to have at one point communicated with the doctor (who stayed in the closed off area) who performed the lobotomies. He told me this man was the source of evil in that building, and multiple people he had operated on (and died, as a result) remained in the building.

Having the upbringing he did, leading to this one night.

It started when Evan's roommate (Justin) was in the shower. When Justin got out, meaning he would've easily saw them even if they managed to get in silently).

The three of them went back to their bedroom, the clothes had been ripped out of the closet, and trash had been strewn everywhere. The creepiest thing was that Evan had shaved about 3 days before that, and that trash had already been taken out- his hair was among the trash in that room. Instantly Evan took out his bible and began to pray. Justin tried to read from the bible, but every time he touched the bible his nose began to bleed profusely. It stopped whenever he took his hands off the bible but would start again when he tried to read from the bible or pray. 

One RA who I'll call Carrie, demanding whatever was there to leave. She knew there was something evil there. She fired for that just a day or two after it happened.

I got very close to my counselor while I was there and she confided in me this had actually happened.  She told me the official story was that Justin had drawn the face in the mirror himself and one of the boys must've destroyed the room (they never could explain that one away) and that Justin had cut *a slit in his own nose* (keep in mind

Other RA's working that night knew what actually happened as well as the people that experienced it. The counselors were told after this happened they were not allowed to tell patients that the unit was haunted or that the paranormal had anything to do with that night. My counselor easily could've been fired for what she told me. They also banned Ouija boards.

So that's what I know about the rehab. I wish there was some way I could provide proof but given the setting I can't think of a way. If anyone has any ideas please let me know. I'll try digging around again for more information on this building.

Ever since I was a child, I immediately became paralyzed. I saw a tall dark figure at my door and I could feel it staring at me...of course I panicked. I closed my eyes and tried to calm down. I believe I went to sleep because when I opened my eyes again I was out of my body flying around the apartment. I flew into the living room because someone was at the door. I opened the door and a blonde haired feral looking boy ran in under me while an alien ran into the apartment going towards the tv. Me and the alien were flyflighting around the living room. I couldn't leave the place I was in, so I decided to kill myself by flying into the tv electrocuting myself. When I woke up, I was really sweaty. 

I'm noticing trends in my sleep paralysis episodes.... Flying

Now for the meditation...I started doing meditation a couple of weeks ago because of its benefits. First time I tried meditation, I heard a voice or felt the energy of  a woman....I can't really describe it. I heard/felt them say ""Wake up, AzulRio."" I was so startled it knocked me out of my meditation and I haven't done it since.

I apologize for the long wall of text. I just really wanted to get everything out in this post although I have more experiences I want to share with you all. I'll just post them later.

I posted something on /r/paranormal before I found this subreddit and I think my first post is in the wrong place. This is the link for my previous post: http://redd.it/1izck8. I was really glad to find this subreddit. 

Any who

I have two older brothers, was a mistake. I chose to go to his room because it was much bigger than mine. In this room I always felt like I couldn’t place my feet on the floor by my bed; I had to jump on or off the bed rather than just placing my feet. Years later when all of us were at my other brother Alan’s house the subject of our parent’s house and the creepy stuff that happened came up. Richard told us that he had a problem with placing his feet by the bed in his old room. This really creeped me out. 

I had a hutch were I kept my trophies and pom poms at the very top. One day I heard a knock and I was dumb enough to knock back, nothing fell which was odd, it suddenly stopped. I was home alone and the wall of this room connects to a second staircase that has vaulted ceilings. The knocks were coming from a place unreachable without the help of a latter. 

During one of my sleep overs in high school the speakers to my computer picked up very loud static even though the computer and the speakers were unplugged and not hooked up. My friend ended up not staying the night.

When I was home from college during winter break I was up late reading a magazine when I heard what I thought were my parents talking (it sounded like a man and a woman). It was around 2 am and thought it was weird so I went down the hall to ask if they were awake. I asked three times, then down stairs, and went so far as to open the front door. Nothing.

During my summer between junior and senior year of college when I would wake up and go down stairs I would see people standing in the back yard. This happened every day for about a month and the number of people also seemed to increase as the days went on.  I would only see them for a few moments and then they would be gone. I haven’t had this happen before or since.

When I was home from college one weekend my boyfriend at the time called me ten minutes before my alarm was going to go off and I decided to lie in bed until it did. The phone I had at the time was an LG Chocolate

I’d really like to see what other people think.

1374643548.0,1ixszv,Something Followed My Friend From Bachelor's Grove Cemetery in Chicago [FR],wontonsoup771,22,3,12,"Hey

As the title suggests

So, we grabbed some burritos and headed over to his house to watch some horror films, which were quite cheesy if I might add. By the time the last film ended, we decided to call it a night, and D drove me to my house to drop me off. 

As we were talking in the car, he was really into going to haunted places around the Chicagoland area and trying to see if he could experience anything paranormal. He mentioned places like the O'hare airport landing strip where the AA 191 crash occurred and the Resurrection cemetery on the south side of the city.

Amidst all of his stories, D, his cousin M, and his friend T went to the cemetery. If you guys are not familiar with the topography of the area, the cemetery is located deep within a forest preserve. D and his company parked on the outer most area of the forest preserve around 3 AM and began to walk a few miles through the woods with a pair of flashlights in order to reach the cemetery right int he middle of the preserve. From D's account, the walk there was uneventful, but they felt as if they were being followed, they kept looking back only to find just darkness staring right back at them. This uneasiness quickened the pace of the group

Once at the cemetery, D suddenly heard whispers near the forest and told everyone to shut up. Everyone went to a crouch and began to listen. There were indeed whispers nearby, but none of the guys couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. After a few minutes, the silence was broken by a yelp from D, and D immediately started running towards the cemetery entrance. M and T eventually caught up with D, and they managed to ask what happened. Apparently D was grabbed by the wrist by some unforeseen entity, and as a result, they heard a clear voice of a woman screaming from the cemetery pond nearby. All three of the guys lost it and ran back to the car, the guys immediately ran off the trail and hid in a nearby bush. However, the guys made a mad dash for the car

You guys would think that this would be the end of that experience

For a full week after the experience, and he would constantly hear distinct shuffle of footsteps over the carpeted floor when no one else was in the house. In addition, things would get moved or just disappear completely. In one instance, he laid a pull-up bar leaning on the corner of the room all by itself and right after he let go of it, the bar fell in the opposite direction from where it was leaning! All these paranormal things aren't limited to times when he was awake. When he would be about to sleep on his bed, he would see this distinctly outlined black/grey haze/fog in one of the top corners of his bedroom. D would try ignore it and pull the covers over his head hoping it would go away, but it would never disappear. This happened starting at the middle of the week, D had enough and decided to deal with this issue. I don't know where he got this idea, it worked, D immediately felt a sense of relief as if a burden was lifted from his shoulders. 

After this experience/incident, he has the habit of pouring rock salt around his car and house to prevent anything from following him back home.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1374644220.0,,

1374216069.0,1im8c0,Unknown Occurrences in Little Falls,LadyPo,20,4,20,"For the past two years, built in 1902 by Swedish immigrants. The main chapel is joined to a slightly more modern building (from the 60s) that held offices and such

It's also really creepy.

Kate had told me stories about how it's supposedly ""haunted"" and how her nana hears weird things and the electricity gets weird... her printer turns on randomly, etc. The latter could be due to the building's age, but they had an electrician check it out a while back and said everything seems to be fine. I have always gone back and forth about whether supernatural things could be real, so it seemed interesting to me. Kate and I are both into that stuff and we made plans to hang out in the chapel area (the creepiest place) late at night while we worked on making these tie blankets. 

**FIRST YEAR**

During the day, but since Little Falls is a tiny town, there are hardly any cars outside the church at night. When I entered the chapel at night for the first time, it was creepy. It felt like we were constantly walking through spiderwebs and our legs and arms kind of tingled. We were listening to the radio quietly and making the blankets on the floor when suddenly, we heard five or six crystal clear footsteps coming from the front of the chapel (where there is a stage... the floor inside is all wooden). From the initial hollow thump of the heel to the soft noise of the toes coming down, they were exceedingly realistic. We both looked at each other with completely startled faces. We heard them over the music and it sounded like a man walking across the stage, even though there wasn't anyone there and the entire room is filled with old stuff like furniture that her nana is trying to sell. Kate asked me

Kate and I talked about it a lot since... the only other weird thing I remember happening was the power completely turning off for about half an hour

**SECOND YEAR**

The first year was a lot of fun (we did other things than ""ghost hunting"") so we planned to go again. We highly doubted that we would hear or see anything and what we had experienced was a once-in-a-lifetime event. We considered the footsteps to be some sort of residual auditory phenomena. 

However, the more intense the paranormal things became. We went out in the chapel at about nine thirty, just to see if anything else would happen. We were talking to ""ghosts"" and laughing at ourselves because we felt silly trying to pretend to be the people from Ghost Adventures. When the time passed and it was shortly after 10:00, the entire place had a darker vibe. Even the light seemed dimmer and the tingly spiderweb feeling was more bothersome. We heard two knocks near the back of the church. The exterior is made of brick and the whole yard is fenced in so it wasn't someone on the outside. The knocks sounded like they were on wood... we looked to the back corner to see wooden boards leaning against the wall. We decided to go to bed for the night after getting too scared. We were just a pair of two frightened 17 year old girls, after all.

We shared a king bed sized mattress on the floor of her guest room (she's eclectic and owns a church as a home... she's kind of awesomely crazy and doesn't have proper furniture, the other direction, back, and back once more. Four swipes. (I'm providing so much detail because I can remember it so vividly and I want to make it seem like you were with my friend and I.) Kate said nervously, ""what was that...?"" and I responded ""I don't know"" and started to panic. For whatever reason, we both fell asleep right away and I don't remember panicking for an entire minute after speaking before sleeping. The next morning, Kate tried mimicking the sound we both heard on her suitcase and it was identical. The room is made of bricks and the door was closed... there were no animals or other people inside.

We spent the day outside walking around and sitting in the sun... we put sunscreen on our chest and face

Two or three nights later, terrified imagination. We decided to leave the next morning.

When I woke up

I have a picture of it

The reason why I'm sharing this story now is because Kate and I are going for another week long visit...

1373555889.0,1i31fd,Experiences from childhood to 22.[ME],StaticSkies,26,9,3," My family has always been very in-tune with the world; on both my mothers and fathers family tree it only takes a few generations passed to find full-blooded Native Americans and tribal leaders. I think my ancestry is why I seem to have been enveloped with the spiritual world long before my earliest memories.

My parents and family/friends who would watch me while I was still in a crib swear to this day that they would see a ""dark feeling"" presence hovering over me - they have home videos of me throwing out of this world tantrums whenever it was time for me to go to my room for a nap or sleep - when I was one my heart stopped and I had to be rushed to the ER, there was a dark figure leaning over touching me. They are convinced that the reason I stopped breathing was because that entity was choking or somehow harming me. Being as I was too young to vouch for my family and friends at the time, I can only say that from the videos, and never-changing stories I have heard over the years that there is some truth to them. (Pertaining to my heart stopping the doctors attributed it to asthma or an allergic reaction that restricted my ability to receive oxygen.”

My own testimonies of my experiences with the spiritual world began when I was four. My grandfather was and still is my favorite person. My parents and I lived across the country from him when he passed away, but I yelled out in happiness to “feel/see” him with me. When my mother came to see why what all my noise was about I told her that grandaddy had come to see me, nobody ever thought it was odd or coincidence that I somehow communicated with him even though he had passed, before they even knew. For most of my childhood I would find myself fully embracing his presence and talking animatedly with him, I scared my family hundreds of times from bursting out laughing at something funny he would do or say.  
I've never doubted that this presence is my grandfather, I smile and exchange “I love you's” and hugs, there is no denying for me that he and the feelings of pure beauty and peace he touches me with are real. 

Along with being able to sense certain “spiritual essences” as a child I had the ability to realize things most people couldn't. I would have dreams that somehow I knew to be messages, but he had to go to a different home so I wouldn't meet him but that was okay. The next morning I told my mother that my baby brother said for us not to be sad, she broke down in tears of shock because she had miscarried him and wasn't planning on telling anyone besides my father she was even pregnant to begin with. // Othertimes I would just have simple dreams about someone calling or coming to visit, or a specific place we would end up passing by. As I've gotten older I've become out of touch with that particular sensitivity, every once in a blue moon I'll have ultrabright-clear dreams about someone being sad for some reason and just know somethings going come up with them, but I never act on it. I've grown up to think on some level it's something to put off to coincidence. 

Being able to acknowledge presences near me has stayed with me though. I've always had times where I would swear on my life there was something else in a place with me. When we moved to my second home my parents  gave me the master bedroom, I yelled for my parents who both heard thumps coming from it, there was nobody  nor animals in the room when they looked. Just random things like that always happen to me. 

I'm convinced it's because I'm from a a family that prides itself on being in touch with their surroundings

My other two best friends

Things started out bad as a tire on my car blew out early on the way there and we were forced to make the rest of the trip on my spare driving under 20 mph.  We were almost late

The festivities didn't end until well after dark.  The drive back to Port Angeles was too risky to make with a spare tire.  It was overcast

The bride asked if we could crash at her grandma's, and we couldn't get together money for a room.  

The bride suggested her other grandma's cabin. Her other grandmother had passed away a few months ago and the cabin she lived in out towards La Push was vacant. My friend K inexplicably said ""No way.  I'm going to take the last bus back to PA.  I'll see you tomorrow."" And walked out the door without another word.  That should have been a big clue to me that something was wrong

I grabbed my things out of my car and R and his new wife drove us out to her dead grandma's cabin about 15 minutes outside of town.  It was called a cabin because it was in the middle of nowhere

W and I felt exactly as you'd imagine we did

R and his wife went to go have their wedding night while W and I tried to figure out exactly where we were going to hide if said crazy uncle did come around.  There was a set of retractable stairs going up to the attic where we found a couple of dusty

In my backpack I still had a couple malt liquors left over from the night before.  Without TV or radio or any other form of entertainment

Without any clocks available we lost track of time and had a decent buzz going. What we heard sobered us up quickly.  We heard a noise that sounded like the doorknob downstairs being shaken violently.  With wide eyes

We began to talk again

Without a clock or watch I don't know how long after we heard the chairs move it was when the phone began to ring.  We waited for the phone to stop ringing (or somebody downstairs to answer it) but it just kept ringing.  It kept ringing beyond what any normal person would wait for an answer.  I figured the crazy uncle, so we were probably alone.  The only people who knew we were here were R and his wife.  With the number of rings I assumed it was an emergency.  I lowered the stairs and took the maul with me just in case.  
I braced for an attack but none came.  Nobody was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs and I could see that the kitchen was clear. I walked over to the still ringing phone and picked it up.  The ringing stopped but there was no dial-tone.  The phone was dead.  I picked up the phone and looked at it.  It wasn't plugged into the wall.  It was an old rotary phone with a mechanical bell that looked like it had been made back in the 60's.  It sat there silent.

I used the bathroom and went back upstairs and told W about the phone.  He said I was messing with him

The phone started to ring again.  We sat and counted the rings.  I remember counting as high as 170 when I decided it was useless.  I wasn't going back downstairs to answer an unplugged phone.  I laid down on the mattress

In the morning W and I woke up early and freezing.  We had no idea when R would be coming for us, no dial tone, nothing.

I moved into an old house with my mom, I was in high school then. Immediately, I didn't feel comfortable in the house. Not only was it small, dingy and old, but there was just something about it that I didn't like, that I couldn't really explain.

He told me that he didn't know why he always felt the need to run through it, that it just freaked him out. This bothered me, since I felt the exact same way in the hallway and had never talked to him about it.

One day, my brother was out and my mom and little sister were in the yard. I was in the hallway and suddenly, I burst into tears. I started sobbing uncontrollably. There was nothing going on with me at the time- it was a perfectly normal day and I had absolutely no reason to be upset about anything. But I just broke down and felt the most intense sadness I had ever felt in my life. I ran outside, still sobbing, to my mom. She freaked out and asked me what was wrong. All I could say was ""I don't know, I don't know what happened"" through my tears. I calmed down after a few minutes, and both my mom and I were terrified. It still bothers me when I think about it.

Noticing that Matt has his phone in his hands. He asks him to place it on the ground. He complies and sets it no more than 10 centimeters away. Once he does that a lady rolls up in a black Scion. One of the ones that looks like a cube. I can see her through the dark to tinted windows. She glances over at us and stops the car. She gets out of the car and looks at the man. She yells at him ""PHIL!"" 
        He doesn't notice her
        He looks up and sees her. She gestures at him to go over there. He doesn't. She then tells us ""Hey guys
        We both immediately separate our hands and grab our phones. I dial 911 just in case something could've happened. My finger hovers above the ""call"" button. She yells his name again. And tells him to go over there. This time he does and they start to talk. I couldn't hear them but I could make out one sentence ""I'm going to call your home
        We both say to each other "" I wonder what the fuck the 'hand game' was. "" we shrug it off and head up to McDonald's for a bite to eat. 
        Later that night at 11:00. I get ready for bed. I crawl into the covers and shut my eyes. ""Hi buddy"" runs through my mind. 
        1 hour later
        I dream of him. ""Hi buddy!"" And his hands are in the position he tried to get our hands in; palms facing the floor
        I call Matt at 9:00 and ask him if he would like to skate that day. He said no because he's hanging out with his girlfriend that day. 
        11:00 am
        I take a look outside and just kind of stare at the house across the street. I see Phil riding down the street on his bike. I close the blinds immediately and get under my comforter. Shielding myself from anything. I hear a knock on the door. I don't get up in fear that it would be him. The knock happens again. But this time on my window. I peek out from under the comforter and look at the window. There's no one there. Nothing. 
        I'm now staying at my uncles in the guest room. I haven't had any encounters with him since. 
        Im not sure why this is happening. I talked to Matt about it and asked him if he has been having any of these strange encounters. He said he hasn't.
         If I have any more encounters with him. I will post again.

1368857070.0,1ekcv1,so this happened a long time ago but.. yeah,Cm124655echo,33,17,8,"first some background info:
i was 13
my brother was 7 we lived in a flat next to my parents house because we owned both of them and he what kids don't want their own house?
the previous owners were notoriously druggo's with connections
i was sleeping in his room because he had been having increasingly bad dreams
and i really enjoy camping

anyways i dont dream.. well rarely, then it started to open slowly and these... i dont know how to explain it, long bubbly elongated fingers ending in a sharp point slid out of the dark gap and caressed the wardrobe then i blinked and they were caressing my little brothers face and this woman was leaning behind him looking at me with hollow black eyes and a cracked black smile the only noise i could hear in this dream was my heart beat, and then she shreiked HE'S MINE and flew back into the wardrobe when it flew shut i was already halfway over the bed when this happened and by the time i stumbled to the wardrobe it was shut
so i flung it open to go after my brother and she was an inch or two from my face and i looked down and her hand was in my chest 
then we bok looked in the direction of a loud bang.
thats when i woke up to my little brother climbing down off the top bunk the loud bang was the steel ladder
he turned around slowly and looked at me and mumbled yes
i asked him what he was doing up this late 
he said he was just going to the toilet
i asked him if he's like me to turn the light on for him and he answered hastily no.
he walked out of the bedroom mumbling to himself 
i was still wrapping my head around my dream/ night terror
after i had processed it i realized Gus had been gone a little while
and i hadn't even heard the toilet door shut and there was no light coming from the bathroom outside my room.
i launched out of my bed knocking my deodorant off his bedside table and ran out into the narrow hallway which was pitch black.
i checked the bathroom and he wasn't there. then i checked the living room where the Xbox was 
i walked in and he was there. just standing in front of the wardrobe looking into the darkness.
i was hesitant at first
so i asked him simply"" Gus what are you doing?"" he just kept staring  and mumbled ""you'll see"" 
then i heard the soft creak of the hinges of the wardrobe
it took a second to register 
it was opening
slowly it began to swing open.
i didn't think i just jumped forward and dragged his little ass back to his bunks i forced him back up on top of the bunk and told him not to move, i picked up the deodorant and my lucky lighter in the top of the bedside table. and i just sat there for what felt like eternity
just watching the door with my deodorant and lighter scared out of my mind staring into the blackness that was what was outside the door
every now and then i would see brief movement outside the door
eventually the first rays of sunshine crept through the window and i allowed myself to close my eyes for a moment. when i awoke my deodorant was on the window sill
the door was closed and my chest hurt quite violently.
i sat up quickly and looked beneath my shirt with my hand
when it came back out it was covered in blood
my blood. in my shock i jumped up and  hit the top of the bunk.
then i woke again. i am certain that before i let my eyes rest it was not a dream 
i pinched myself to see if i could register pain
my brother was non the wiser to what had occurred the night before

the only rational thing i could imagine is that he was sleep walking and i was experiencing hallucinations from... dehydration? heat stroke? i don't know, have any of you Redditers experienced anything like this before ? id like your opinions as to what really happened that night

It was night. I was in my room, I heard something that instantly removed any desire to fall asleep.

It was a scratching at my door. It sounded as if an animal were dragging its claws against the lower portion of the wood.

Normally, for reasons unknown, the scratching inspired a sense of panic and terror in me.

This occurred back when I was in the 4th grade (now 18 years old). Because my siblings were both in junior high

Towards the end of the school year I began to have a recurring dream about a man waiting for me when I came home from school and binding me until the rest of my family came home where he bound them too. At first i wasn't scared

Anyways I began to get scared as soon as I came into the house after school. Scared to the point that I would leave and sit in my yard waiting for my brother and sister to get home. One day I opened my door and decided that it was time I got over this because nothing had happened. I walked to the kitchen to grab food, maybe the wind slammed the door shut somehow.

I'm the youngest of 9 although I only grew up with 5 of them; 4 sisters and 1 brother. This story involves the sister closest in age to me

We pretty much had a shared vision. It's weird. We were driving to meet up with my mom at a gathering just over an hour away from where we were. I was the one driving

There was a long straight stretch of highway

I could see that the back doors were open and what appeared to be a paramedic placing someone onto a stretcher and into the back of the ambulance. 

As we got closer and closer

Because as we got nearer to what I could swear was an ambulance, passing us by.

I was so incredibly confused for a good 30 seconds before I blurted out

My sister blurts out

She went on to explain she thought there was a stretcher and a person by the ambulance and I told her it was exactly how I saw it.

As we continue on our journey, there were several bends in the highway up ahead.

As we're wondering about this phantom ambulance that we both now swear we saw

Our jaws drop and she points at it. We're now wondering what the hell is happening. We just lit up a couple of cigarettes and continued on. Still have no clue or explanation but we swear to god there was an ambulance

Here's another story involving the same sister. Story above probably took place about six years ago. This next story takes place a year later. 

I was still living with my mom when my sister came to visit for the weekend. She was living about 8 hours away with her boyfriend and several cats. 

She slept in my room with me during her visit and on the last night

Side note: I also had two cats but I never let them in at night otherwise they'll keep me awake doing regular cat things in the dark. So I knew going into bed that after shutting my door

Shortly after shutting off the lamp to go to sleep

A moment after I finally settled in

I paused, there was nothing on the bed, both cats were not in the room either.

I ended up falling asleep and woke up the next morning before my sister left to go back home. I told my mom &amp; sister what happened the night before and my sister said she had no clue

So she leaves. Later that night she called crying. She called to say that while she was here visiting us

1365561657.0,1c1c8m,[FAM] Grandparents' trailer on an island,settec,19,3,2,"I have a few stories about my grandparents' trailer that I thought might interest a few people here. These happened to my family members. 


My mom told me these stories, but rather more likely to rationalize it. These took place at my grandparents' trailer that they lived in when they were older. My mom is the 7th of 13 siblings; the youngest, my uncle, lived with my grandparents and the trailer went to him upon their deaths. The trailer was located on a small island with a community with at most 100 people, on a large lake. The island in general is a fairly 'dark' place - suicides, many addictions, etc. 


The first involves my Aunt, getting louder and louder and sounding closer and closer, coming over the lake. The sound of large, heavy chains dragging continued until it sounded like it was right outside the trailer, then under the trailer at which point the sound stopped. 


At another time, but realized she had forgotten her jacket and went back to get it. When you go in to the trailer, to the right is the living room area, directly in front is the kitchen area, and to the left a wall and a door to the hallway which runs down the left end of the trailer, where my grandfather was in a room sleeping. She went in to get her jacket, she heard my grandfather's distinct sound of slippers shuffling down the linoleum floor from his room at the far end of the trailer, she said ""papa, there he was, so there's no way he would have left the room and made it back without her hearing. 


The last instance occurred when another one of my aunts, and my other uncle were walking up to the trailer from outside. My cousin, Ronald, was laughing and pointing to the right front corner of the trailer and giggling. When they got in, he continued laughing and pointing at the same corner. Nothing was in the corner, except a little ornament fireplace. The three of them were pretty confused as to what he was laughing so intently at, my aunt went to go check out the corner and was reaching to put her arm down there when my cousin yelled ""no mommy, where my uncles were sitting. The globe from the fixture was broken. My parents bought the trailer from my uncle and we can still see black smoke around the globe.

Anyway this just happened and I'm kinda freaked out. My mom and I were sitting around talking about how we aren't going to be at the house tomorrow and from down the hall we heard ""Why aren't we going to be here?"" Needless to say we just kinda stared at each other. Then she told me about a few other stories that happened within the last month.

As my mother was getting ready for work in the morning she put her phone on the couch in our living room and went to the bathroom to finish her hair. When she came out to look for her phone it wasn't there. When she finally found it

2 weeks ago we had a huge snow storm and my brother and I were at my fathers house. As she was lying in bed for the night she heard fast heavy footsteps coming down the hall towards her room. Needless to say she was freaked out but nobody was there. 

The day after she heard our front door open and close and our mailbox on our house open and slam shut (it's metal and very squeaky) when she checked there wan nothing there and no footsteps in the snow.

One day after my mom got back from the grocery store I stood at the door and asked if she needed help with the bags. I heard a ""SHHHHHHH"" and was pushed outside hard enough to almost fall over.

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can hear the closet in the hall rattling as if someone is pushing on it from the inside.

This one was a while ago but I had a dream I was in my basement and I was surrounded by an oppressive darkness and felt ""entities"" around me. They felt angry and I had the feeling I was somewhere I shouldn't be.

1364002794.0,1au3n3,[ME][FR][PIC] Ghost hunt in rural Sweden (Grästorp),Hexates,22,5,4,"Apologies in advance if this tale seems rough around the edges or hazy on the details

So a few years ago (10th of October 2010 I think) a friend of mine talked me into joining her for a ghost hunt
For the sake of this post we will refer to her as ”E” since I don't think she'd appreciate her name being spread all over the Internet.

Anyways
She had visited the place a few years earlier with some other friends, which made me far more interested since possessions are quite intriguing.

Anyways
When we got there it was sometime around midnight
I had brought my camera along
The old derelict barn further added to the creepy atmosphere of the place
E claimed that there was supposed to be an old house at the farm where the family had lived
We did however find an old small farmhouse that I we guessed had been a sty or something similar. We placed a lamp in there to illuminate the darkness. On the floor
The ghost hunters had brought with them EMF-meters that they checked
They wanted to investigate the sty more but we also wanted to check the rest of the farm so we decided to check the rest of the place first and then return there.

We wanted to get into the barn

Anyways

This is where the story gets interesting. 

I stood with my back towards the opening where the door had once been when suddenly I heard a sound from behind me
I spun around as quick as I could to catch sight of the creature but there was nothing there. I asked the others if they had heard anything  and I think they had.
E and one of the ghost hunters had been standing right in front of me
I dunno if there actually was a ghost or something that had lifted the edge of my coat or if she had just seen the tip of my coat rise as I started to spin around

Shortly after we packed up and left and I have nevere gone back there since.

I was reading some stories on here and remembered some strange things that were happening to me while I lived in my families first house after we moved to Tennessee. We moved here from Bulverde

To show you where this house was located,0.00327&amp;sll=36.156423,-85.497864&amp;sspn=0.001522,0.00327&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=345+E+Stevens+St,+Cookeville,+Tennessee+38501&amp;z=19). If you look at the aerial picture it was demolished and made into a parking lot. If you go into the street view, you can see the house. 

I actually never wanted to speak about the house because of what happened there and being afraid of whatever that had happened continuing after we moved out of there. It scared me so bad I never talked or tried to think about it because of the idea that it would happen again. I eventually asked my mom and sister if anything strange happened to them while there and they said no. 

This was our first official home. We were very poor at a time and having a room of my own this size was awesome. We moved to TN with the best of intentions and things were working out great. 

I used to be scared of the dark really bad and had to have the tv or something on to fall asleep. My mom knew this and she didn't care as long as I got some sleep. This was a habit that developed up to middle school

Before the really strange things started to happen

Some time passes and one day my mom and sister are out shopping for groceries. I am on my computer in my room and my sisters computer turns on, blaming me. 

This is when strange things started to happen more often. Every time something did happen I would immediately attempt to justify it

My best friend at the time came over one day and we were watching tv while browsing the internet. He begins to watch this show that, the remote is on the windowsill away from us, and we both are kind of speechless. It flips through some channels before stopping. He responds saying,""Ooo...kay."", and we decide that is enough tv for now. 

Same friend,""Why are you breathing so heavy?"", and he responds,""I thought that was you."" Nobody else was home but us and he instantly starts to look out my window to see if anyone was out there. By this time I am staring at the ground, unable to find a suitable justification to the heavy breathing that I could still hear. I tell him lets get some pizza and we go to the kitchen. From the kitchen, which is 2 rooms away, I could still hear the breathing coming from my room. 

This was the moment that I hated this house. We moved a few months after the breathing began and I always wondered if the strange occurrences was the reason it was turned into a driveway. Maybe other people experienced more of the same I did. I refuse to go back there though.

I grew up in a small town in the mid-west. Much of the historical integrity of the town was preserved.

My friends and I were hanging out after school, but none of us thought twice about it. Besides, it was daylight, and that was the last thought on our minds.

Well, and they finally asked, ""Why?""

""Can't you see the man over there...he looks angry

They looked at me like I was insane. They could not see the man. I kept pointing and thought they were playing a trick on me

When I have talked to my friends about it since then

And for my next one...

I live in the Southwest near the Navajo reservation now. My friend lived outside of town on the reservation

As we were walking on the tracks

Now you have to picture where we were. The reservation is very quiet and empty. There were no houses nearby and really no reason for an old lady to be out in the middle of nowhere

We kept walking and we both turned to each other. 

""Do you see that?"" I asked my friend.

We both realized something was wrong and started running away. We stopped and turned around only to see the old lady had disappeared. She was NOWHERE in sight

One day however I decided to be adventurous and on a night walk (around 8pm) I decided to venture on down to the railroad tracks and walk down a path that ran parallel to the tracks. The weird thing about this path

So, so I bent down, picked it up, and examined it with my phone light. Turned out to be nothing more than a really smooth rock. What happens next still gives me chills.

As I'm examining this rock, voice whisper in my right ear, *""what is that?""*

I'm getting goosebumps and tearing up...thinking about this story. In the upstairs bathroom there was a tiny sealed door. Again, and we as a family acknowledged, and accepted them.

After maybe a year of living in this house these bumps turned into crashes. Everyone in my family slept upstairs...and all through the night, and tried to assure each other that we weren't going insane.

Eventually this thing...started coming up the stairs at night. I can't describe the terror my brother and I shared. This thing would slowly walk up the creaky stairs

It got worse. We started experiencing anomalies during the day. We would hear people talking in a far off area of the house. My brother claims that ""something"" pushed a small bookshelf onto him. (I didn't see this

Whatever the fuck it was

We started hearing pounding, we really became horrified. We refused to use this restroom. We were losing sleep over this. It quickly became ""an issue"", but we got through it somehow, despite the terror filled nights of no sleep. I can't imagine being alone through it all.

One day we decided to open up the sealed room above ""the odd room"", so we had to stack up whatever we could find, and made a sort of make-shift staircase. I was the first and only to enter.

As I slid open the wood panel

As I stood up, but I had come this far. I looked into the darkness...and something was looking back, from the far side of the severely cluttered attic. As we locked eyes....whatever it was panicked, as did I. There was a loud crash, and all I could see was a pale white colored...something darting across the attic. I screamed at the top of my lungs, and the make-shift staircase collapsed beneath me as I toppled to the ground.

I immediately ran to my Mother and informed her...""There's something in the attic! I saw it! I swear to god!"" she replied simply ""What were you doing up there? Don't ever go up there again."" and I obeyed. I don't know if she was too lazy to look for herself

Fast forward an unsure amount of time (maybe months). I had grown to accept my fear as a constant, I had to find out what where that tiny door in the bathroom led.

In a somewhat less formal manner, it revealed the attic from the opposite end! I slammed it shut, locked it, and never inquired within again.

Growing up, he was a friendly drunk. He was always funny, goofy, and everyone always liked him, but I was too young to realize that he was wrecked pretty much 24/7. As a child, I always thought my dad was really funny, so at night I would have him come in and tell me bedtime stories. He would tell the most ridiculous stories that would end up keeping me awake and laughing for hours. Then, my old man would pass out in my bed while I would lie there wired and wide awake.

This was a pretty regular occurrence, I was lying in bed wide awake, staring at the open bedroom door out into the hallway. I did this all the time because I was afraid of the dark, and our hallway light was kept on at night. You know, usual scared little kid stuff. Then, I watched a kid walked into my room from the hallway. He looked to be around the same age as me, maybe a little older. He had very light blonde hair and was wearing navy blue slacks and a Light blue polo shirt. The thing is, but it's the best comparison I can think of.

The kid stopped right inside my door and looked at me. He just smiled and waved like he was happy to see me. Looking back on it, trying to wake him up. That, of course, didn't work. He was out.

First off a little description of my attitude towards unexplained things: I pretty much try to debunk everything I hear/read from people or on the internet. But what happened to me this holiday

Last fall I drove me and my sister over to my parents who hired a little cabin in the woods for their holiday. We stayed there the weekend

The first night it started maybe 15 minutes after going to bed. I was almost asleep when I started hearing a metallic thumping noise, and do it again. 
Sadly I am not someone of great patience, the noises stopped.

The next morning during breakfast I carefully mentioned the sounds and almost immediately my sister replied ""I thought that was you!""
Turns out
My parents both responded with that they had heard a loud bang somewhere in the night

The next night I had the exact same thing happen. It was very quiet and suddenly the banging picked up again. This time it did not last that long as my mother charged into my room. ""Did you hear that loud crash??"" she yelled looking very puzzled.
I had not. Just a repetition of that same annoying clunking sound.

One night I'm sound asleep and I wake to the sound of a very, so the creaking was still pretty noticeable. I get up and walk to the top of the stairs and look down.

It's dark out, he's darker than the very dim light in the stairwell. He is wearing a wide-brim hat that is rounded on top. I can tell from the shape of the hat that he is looking down, like he is watching his feet while walking up the stairs.

Then, it's still night, and I can't move, then I wake up and it's morning.

While googling for this I came across this site saying it's a common dream:

1344634360.0,y0nj2,[ME] [FR] The Ghost Cat,breannaland733,19,3,10,"I promised I would share my other experiences so I thought this would be the best one to share next.  I chose this experience because it was the first one to be confirmed by another person without any prompting who was not related to me.

About 9 years ago I moved into my first one bedroom apartment.  It was a very small complex (only 2 buildings, but so close to the campus of my college that it may as well have been on it.  The complex was not new, but I wouldn't call it old either, dating back to the late 1960s/early 1970s (one building from each decade--I think mine was the 70s edition).  It was a relatively quiet complex for being so close to the campus of a party school.  Mostly grad students lived there so being a 20 yr old undergrad, I kind of stuck out.  Everyone kept to themselves, but you'd share the occasional ""hey"" or nod in acknowledgement though not much more than that.  I say this because it's important to note that none of the neighbors were close enough to each other that I would have been able to share this experience with anyone in order to confirm/debunk/theorize anything.

Our apartment complex did not allow pets of any kind, particularly whenever I tried to go to bed, I would hear a cat meowing very loudly.  I passed it off very quickly thinking maybe it was just a stray trying to get someone's attention.  After the 3rd time or so of hearing this, I started trying to find the source of the noise.  There were only 2 windows in the apartment (one in my bedroom that was level with the parking lot so all I could see was car tires and one in the living room that had a window A/C unit and opened to the patio/breezeway that everyone else's front door was on).  I looked out the windows to see nothing, but figured the noise either carried from somewhere in the parking lot I couldn't see or from the the breezeway on the second floor.

After trying to find the nonexistent cat, and given that it sounded so loud that it could've been in just the next room (my apt was only 2 rooms- bedroom or living room/kitchen &amp; I would hear it from both rooms), the illegal pet theory seemed the most logical.

But then I started seeing things.  I'd be laying in bed trying to fall asleep and get the feeling like a cat had just jumped up on my bed.  Having grown up with cats, I wasn't always coherent and would often think it was one of my pets from home, forgetting that I was in my apt away at college, 300 miles from my pet at home.  Any time I would reach to pet the cat or go to look for it, there would be nothing there, but I could see an indentation in the blankets as if something had been sitting there.

I've had similar experiences in virtually every place I've lived--the whole feel like a cat just jumped on the bed only to find nothing there.  I always assumed it was the spirit of the family cat we had when I was born.  He essentially grew up with me

When I'd be laying in bed I would see the tip of a cat's tail at the edge of the bed.  My bed sat fairly low to the ground so it looked as if a cat was walking by and I'd catch the top 3-4 inches of the gray tail over the edge of the bed as it would walk past.  Naturally, there was nothing there.

Then I started seeing it in the living room.  I'll do my best to describe the setup.  (Still kind of new to reddit and what not so if I knew how to make a nifty layout of the apt for y'all to see, etc.  

I would be sitting on my futon watching tv when out of my periphery on the right, but I also had a plethora of junk filling up most of the top of the table, obscuring my view anyway.  Well of course the tail would catch my attention so I'd lean forward to try to catch a glimpse of this cat just in time to catch the hindquarters walking past the edge of the futon.  It was always making this trek from my bedroom to the window.  The window unit was there so there was no way anything could have walked through the wall.  The cat was always solid, not misty or light, but it looked like an actual cat.  This pattern went on for months, combined with the sounds and the sensation on my bed as I was sleeping.

Now, I passed much of it off as being the energy from MY cat that had followed me until I started seeing the cat.  It was always the same pattern, same direction, and I never saw more than the tail or hindquarters of this gray cat. 

I knew enough to not think I was crazy, I always got the feeling she was dismissing my experience as bullshit.  One day, we're both out to dinner with our friends Matt and Justin, and the topic of ghosts comes up.  I mention that I think my apartment has a ghost.  Before I could go any further, Matt chimes in, ""Yeah I've seen the gray cat."" Gina turned white as a sheet as Matt proceeds to relay the exact same description of his experience.  Apparently this had happened on several occasions while he in my apartment.  I was always there when he saw it, sometimes even sitting next to him on the futon, he describes the experience down to every minor detail, I've kind of deemed it as my first ""adult"" paranormal experience (for lack of a better description).",t5_2sntx

I apologise for the low-key storytelling in my posts


I have a fairly large family with 10 cousins and 1 brother and our aunts and uncles would take us to Nelson Bay every year for 2-3 weeks so we could enjoy being in a different place with more sun and freedom before school started up again.


It is called 'Middle Rock Caravan Park' and the cousins and I would reside in a caravan + a tent right outside for the nights we snuck out a few beers from the cabin where the adults slept in. We came as a family but we all needed to relax


One night after a day at the beach


I remember the following events like it happened this morning. I had just made some hot chocolate and made my way down from the kitchen to the couch. There were 4 cousins standing to my left talking

Now

Our family friend who was with us stood next to me and I remember this eerie feeling entering the room because everyone just went silent.
Nobody spoke for about 5 seconds and I remember looking up thinking ""What the weird?!?!""

When all of a sudden
It took us all a couple of seconds to realise what had happened before we panicked and ran out of the caravan. Since that night


I figured it was a spirit connected to the location and by the end of the week we were so toasted and high on life that we had forgotten all about our encounter with this black mass.
To give some background on this following part


Both of our living spaces had the same layout. Once you came through the front door you were standing in the space that divides the living room area to the dining and kitchen. To your right you had a corridor that ran adjacent to the entry which held the two rooms


Now I always knew something was up with this building because I always heard children laughing on the stairs when no one was home (we had a close family, he was gone.
Back to my original story. I thought we were safe from whatever entity decided to show itself on that night in the caravan park - I was so wrong.


From a point in the kitchen bench which faces the living room

Suddenly
I quickly grabbed a knife (I had watched Scream too many times and figured I better have some sort of defence) only to find nothing.


A couple of weeks later I was walking up the stairs when I saw a white flash of light before my eyes. At that moment I had the urge to tie up my shoelace which I had let get undone because I was close to my apartment anyway. The white flash was gentle

When you entered the house, open doorways. One was a living room and the other was supposed to be a dining room but we just used it for extra furniture and hanging out.  At the end of the hallway to the left was the kitchen and the hallway dead-ended into a bathroom.  To the right, through the living room and down a step, was a huge utility room/storage room and another bathroom. (Sorry for all the description, but it's kind of important to this story.) This area was a little more secluded from the rest of the house, but still pretty close to everything.

One early afternoon, so it was hard to keep track of who was going to be home at any given time. I wasn't sleepy or lying down in the tub where I might have drifted off into sleep. It was quiet in the house, no radio or tv on.  I heard the front door open and close and heavy footsteps come down the hallway. Someone says my name. Though immediately after, I oddly couldn't remember if the voice sounded male or female, I knew it didn't sound like either my sister or my gf. I called out my sister's name. No answer. Called out my gf's name. No answer. The footsteps still coming towards the back of the house.  I was a little nervous, but not terrified as  at that time, there were a lot of friends that would just come into the house and I had heard my name called

I did feel nervous for some reason, look down the hallway. No one. Go down the hallway, check the front door. Locked.

Definitely freaked out now, by the time I got out of the tub and gone into the living room....they wouldn't have had time to get back out of the house.

I live up in Alaska and over a year ago me and my best friend (after alot of discussion, still a skeptic, thought it was fun but still thought the Paranormal wasn't really there. That changed shortly thereafter.

Our first crazy experience was on a night we weren't investigating (we had gone about three times since the first night, but as college kids, we stay up all the time so we were pretty lucid. We decided to walk over to a nearby Carrs, get some snacks and what-not. It was on our way back that our experience happened.

I told him the man hadn't moved so I glanced back and saw he was half the distance from the streetlight to us. That was when I first got frightened. The next bit might be explained away as us being scared or someone trying to mug us, and when we checked over out shoulders it was even closer

Needless to say we didn't get sleep for sometime after that. I'm not sure if it was something paranormal or maybe we just outran a mugger but it was a jarring experience.

They weren't hot or cold, they hand no arms attached to the wrists. I saw them lingering on either side of my ankles (in my head, I wasn't actually looking at my feet) for maybe 2 seconds, and then they lurched forward and grabbed them. I freaked out, jumped out of bed, ran out of my room, and that's all I remember.

My post:

Ah
Years ago (in the early 70's) my mother was walking through Strathclyde Park (Near Hamilton, Wild by name and nature. A big bold dog apparently, fiercely protective and afraid of nothing. Anyway, they were strolling through the park, and it was a quiet day so they let the dog off the leash. in a fairly secluded, quiet section of the park, surrounded by trees and bushes, around the corner out of sight. My mother and her Auntie hear a commotion, literally trembling, the auntie is the typical bold as brass west of Scotland woman
The thing is, at the Hamilton Mausoleum (google it if you want an image). I think the rest of her family were picnicing elsewhere (I hope that she wasn't roaming about on her own!). The Mausoleum is closed off now, but at the time (mid 70's) you could enter it and wander about (I'm sure there is some story about it being designed so that it gives the 'longest lasting echo' within any building, but i'm not sure if i'm remembering that incorrectly). So, my mum wanders in, admiring the lovely-albeit slightly creepy- interior. She is quite near the entrance, and the only one in the place. She hears echoing footsteps, wondering who else could be here. from out of the shadows steps a tall, as if watching her. My mum's stomach nearly drops as she recognises the guy
I tried to make that story as undramatic as possible, but she's a bit spooky, she's got loads of stories). Maybe he was just a creep who liked old clothes, but he seemed unworldly apparently...

About 4 years ago, a large number of changes have taken place in my life and have changed the way I see the world. About 7-8 months ago, my vision started changing. There's really no other way to put it. There was about a week where my vision was very fuzzy, I of course attributed it to getting older and my eyesight getting worse. However, after that time, my vision actually improved. Colors, lines, textures all appeared to me much more defined and brighter, like they're pulsating. I see geometric shapes
  


The same has happened with my other senses as well. Especially with my hearing. I'm a musician, and muffled. Other times, the way I hear sounds is completely different. I can hear lines and sounds in music I could never hear before, and all the components sound separate but harmonious at the same time (nebulous, I know). I have heard strange things. This is where the ""crazy"" stuff starts happening. I sometimes will be in a room and hear what sounds like chimes, just this beautiful ringing sound that almost sounds like it's coming from another place beyond where I usually hear. I live in an old house, and sometimes I hear chatting, I live in a city and have neighbors in the same building as me. I hear lots of rushing and buzzing sounds.  I've been in a building and heard a strange sound of wind, I know that sounds strange
  

I've become intolerant of a lot of foods, I can't eat food for hours, because it just tastes so disgusting. This never happened to me before. Also, certain foods are even more delicious than before! 
  

My skin is more sensitive than it used to me, usually after I go outside. This didn't happen to me before. 
 

 As for physical symptoms, nausea, severe allergy problems, flu symptoms (constantly), heart palpitations, severe neck and back pain, insomnia, the list goes on. Again
 

 My emotional problems have been the hardest to deal with. I've had bouts of anxiety, I'll feel inexplicably sad, or very anxious, whichever. I've been reexamining my old thoughts and beliefs, and it seems like a lot of repressed negative emotions and problems are surfacing, many of which I weren't even aware were there. 
 

 Now, which could very well be the case. However, at the same time, I feel more at peace with myself, my family, my friends, and every single person I meet. My relationships have gotten healthier, and I feel more joyful and in tune with myself and with others. I know a lot of people write this off as bullshit, but I've already written a book.

I was pretty freaked out by this point naturally, and went to bed the next night.  Needless to say, there were even more of these scratches the next morning.  They looked exactly like if you took a sewing needle and dragged it fairly hard down someones skin.  Odd.

One more night of this after that and I had had enough.  There is this corner in my bedroom ceiling (my parents house is a really weird shape) that no light ever gets into, I had this feeling that the corner had something to do with it.

The first encounter I can remember was when I was eight or so, my eyes close, and i thought my mother sat on my bed and started rubbing my leg to get me to wake up and get out of bed. When she didn't stop rubbing my leg, I opened my eyes and looked towards the end of my bed, only to find the room absolutely empty. After that, I would hear my name being whispered in my ear very clearly as if someone was standing right behind me. 

Another encounter occurred a couple years after, as it was late. My bedroom light was off, but the hallway was lit from my mother's room, which was right across the hall. I couldn't sleep, so I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling. For some reason, I felt extremely uncomfortable almost instantly and felt compelled to look towards my door.

I was asked to get something from my room, so when I went upstairs to my room to get whatever the thing was. My light was on, and I had paused my ipod. My back was facing the window, which was a straight drop down, as it was a flat wall on the side of the house where my window was. I had gotten the thing, was shuffling through the songs, and my iPod completely turned off. Exactly at this moment, but I didn't tell anyone what happened. 

My most memorable encounter was summer of 2010. I was staying at my grandmother's house, I have NEVER had more than a creepy feeling during anytime, night or day, I've spent in that house. One night, while sleeping in my grandmother's room on the second floor, I had a case of insomnia, so I had decided to choose a book to read out of the vast selection lining the walls on all three floors (seriously, give or take, and thought maybe someone was down stairs (at that time it was being used as a boarding house for at least 6 different people).

My uncle passed away of MS in 2003 in the house, and my grandfather also passed away earlier this month of multiple types of cancer, also in this house. As my grandfather was dying, a lot of discussion came up about recurrences of paranormal things from my father, other two uncles, just like my late uncle). 
A few things have happened since talk came up: my Mac computer, and shows up to the user screen if the table is hit hard enough. It goes off maybe twice or three times a week (not sure if that is paranormal, but I have heard of things like that). I hear my name being whispered very clearly in my right ear a LOT.

My Mom was a complete skeptic when it came to anything paranormal. Mind you, were sitting with me, having a drink and talking about old times.

That’s when my Aunt brought up the story of the house in Maryland. My Mom immediately scoffed and didn’t want her to tell the story in front of me

My Aunt told the story anyway

My Mom was 17 and had married and moved out on her own

The rest of the family, and their Mom, moved into a new home in a relatively small town. My Grandfather had passed away the year previously.

The house was huge compared to the small shack they had lived and been born 
Apparently

When my Grandmother expressed interest in renting the house

The landlord kept his brand new trailer in the barn. My Aunt described it as
My Grandmother, the “weird stuff” started happening. 

The house consisted of a large living room that led into the kitchen

The upstairs had 3 bedrooms, next door to Buddy and Wilbur’s room.

The night after moving in

“Get your cold feet off me!”

“I don’t have my feet on you.”

My Aunt said they quieted down but it wasn’t long before they started again.

“I said get your cold feet of me

“You get your cold feet off ME!”

It must have dawned on both of them at the same time that the cold they were feeling wasn’t from their brother because Aunt Cissy said

My Grandmother told them to shut up and go to sleep. She was a no nonsense woman—or as my Mom use to say

The next morning, they’d find the barn doors open. Not even a chain kept them closed.

Then one morning

They all ran into the kitchen and my Aunt insists that they saw a headless woman.

She was standing by the old tree stump that was used to cut wood. Aunt Cissy described her as wearing a dress down to her ankles and what looked like a white full body apron. 

One of the brothers opened the backdoor and the headless woman disappeared.

The entire time they lived there, opening the attic door and walking around up there. 

My uncles would experience touching and coldness in their room

My Grandmother didn’t believe them and not even having to close the barn doors every morning

But the headless woman did it.

She asked the landlord point blank

The landlord confessed that it did belong to his family for generations but for a few years after the Civil War

The staff which consisted of two nurses and one doctor lived on the top floor 

The rest of the residence housed wounded Union soldiers who couldn’t take care of themselves due to missing limbs

The convalescence home was shut down when one of the “mental patients” took an axe

The landlord told my Grandmother that when his Uncle, he had inherited the house. The landlord had tried to rent the home on two separate occasions, telling the tenants that people had heard things in the house and that the barn doors would never stay closed. Both times, the tenants didn’t believe in ghost stories and both times they moved out within a few weeks.

This time when he rented to my Grandmother

My Grandmother didn’t move though. My Aunt said they stayed there for about 4 years. Eventually

My Mom never saw any of this but did visit the house a few times and said

I got curious as an adult and tried to look into the history of the house. My Mom told me what street it was on—though for the life of me I can’t remember now. I didn’t find out anything---this was in the dark days BEFORE THE INTERNET! 

Not long after I married

Every day, so I used to get a taxi to school. I used to have regular taxi drivers, and there was one particular taxi driver who was very fond of any real paranormal experiences. she told me of her brother's experience.
______________________

Her brother worked for years in bars around the country

He'd just begun working in a new pub called ""the lowther castle"" (it may have just been ""the lowther"" though) in Cumbria
The way that the pub was laid out
This night, and they heard a crash noise from the storeroom. One of the guests investigated the noise, only to find that this young man was unconscious on the floor, with a tray of smashed pots and tea nearby. no doubt he had collapsed. an ambulance was phoned to take him away to hospital. eventually, the same day, he awoke again, but was very distressed. there was nothing medically wrong with him

He was walking through the back room of the pub, he stopped still as he saw a translucent woman in a flowing blue gown walk out of the door in front of him, and directly through him. The next thing he knew he was in the hospital bed.

1327162249.0,oqam6,Get back to the road [UPDATE and further development],Ensifearthem,21,3,17,"**Edit:** I probably should have put an [FR] in the title as the further development largely concerns the testimony of two of my friends.

What you are about to read is so bizarre that I would not have believed it were it not told to me by two very close friends. What really sold me was that one of them is an avowed skeptic who has trouble buying anything that he cannot understand physically and tangibly. This is **not** a ghost story intended to scare or amaze; this is a legitimate unexplained phenomenon that I am very actively looking to investigate and understand. 

This is not a throwaway account. If you doubt my legitimacy

**Backstory/Tl;dr for those who did not see my original post**

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/nwfd3/get_back_to_the_road/) is a link to the original.

I'm 17, spent lots of time in a large [approx. 10 km²] forest located in the southern part of town. Essentially forms a barrier between Allen and Ian's respective houses. We went for a walk in the woods at night, intense feeling of being watched and reviled, strange moaning sound heard [possible explanations suggested by users in the other thread: deer and other fauna; no sound clips I have heard so far have matched.] The feeling of fear was so intense that it caused us all to leave. 

We aren't skittish people and we often spend a lot of time in the woods after dark

**Recent development:**
I've only got round to explaining this now because I was trying to do research and compile as much information as I could before setting it all together to avoid looking like I was telling tall tales. I think a part of me also didn't really want to pursue this any further as it does creep me out quite a bit. A larger part of me

Monday
Approximately 18 days after the original occurrence. 

I'm back in Toronto now. I received a text from Ian explaining that he and Lewis had gone into the woods again for what I assume to be the first time since our experience a few weeks before. Ian said that he and Lewis had found a new area of the forest. About half a kilometer away from an open field in which we often build fires, as per usual, until they reached this open field. That's when they started to get a bit uncomfortable, like that night over the break. He said that suddenly he and Lewis heard the moaning sound again, and immediately following it, a very sharp and harsh grinding sound. He described it as similar to a steam engine braking, but bassier and sort of crackly-- like a roar. He said it was so loud that he and Lewis were compelled to put their hands over their ears. They began to walk quickly back towards the way they had come, they heard the sound again-- this time louder. In the background Ian said they could hear the sound of trees ""cracking and breaking"" (*note:* I interpreted this sound to be similar to a large animal walking through underbrush

At this point I had only been receiving sloppy text messages sent by Ian,) and gave Ian a call. He didn't pick up despite the fact that I tried him several times, so I grudgingly returned to class. About 45 minutes later, on the bus home from school, I tried again and Ian picked up. He sounded terrified, and he was stammering quite a bit. He recounted to me exactly what happened, and I could hear Lewis in the background trying to give his two cents as well. I asked Ian to put me on with Lewis who seemed just as confused and upset-- if not more so. This was incredibly significant to me as I have said several times that Lewis does not scare easily, and had to hang up as my phone was running out of battery. When I arrived at my s.o.'s house about 15 minutes later

This event has been a hot topic between us for the past few days, one of the places in which the sound recorded (Windsor, Ontario) is about a four hour drive away from the town in which this occurred. I'd seen these videos before and didn't know what to think about them; I saw the thread discussing them on reddit a few days ago and since I hadn't made the connection I dismissed the sounds as some stupid viral marketing ploy. Now I'm not really sure what to think.
Ian was talking to his mother and apparently a friend of hers used to walk her dogs in the woods often. They recently started to get somewhat skittish, she heard the same sound that Ian and Lewis did and high-tailed it out.

Before somebody suggests it

I am totally confused and at a loss for an explanation as to what exactly is going on. I hope that I presented this story in a legitimate way and if anybody has any doubts I'll do my best to flesh out the story a little better. If anybody has any similar experiences or possible explanations they'd like to share

""This is a recollection of something I just cannot explain and it terrifies me

When I was younger I would always find myself waking up early in the morning. Normally you would expect to be greeted by a parent or sibling, hiding under my blankets in fear, hoping one of my parents would come and ""wake"" me. This image of a man standing over me greeted me every morning for as long as I can remember sleeping in that room.

Things I can clearly remember involve him changing positions in my room. Sometimes he would be hunched over near the head of my bed

I changed my room in our house a few times, but it was mine. I completely forgot about the shadow that had haunted me in my first room. However, some nights and mornings I would wake up see something moving out of the corner of my eye. Reminiscent of my childhood, I would always instinctively pull the bed covers over my head and try to fall back asleep.

This time I put it down to just staying up too late

Last week, wake up"". I turned groggily a little annoyed because she never lets me sleep in. Only to have her whisper to me in a terrified voice ""There's a shadow of a man standing over you"". Suddenly all the images of him from my childhood flooded my mind, I did the only thing I could, I pulled the covers over my head. I hope he stops watching me.""

Unfortunately I received some criticism and downvotes for my somewhat sloppy writing skills but these experiences are true. I do not want any criticism but I would like people's thoughts and opinions on the subject. Please any sort of insight would be helpful. Here is an update on what has happened over the last 2 months.

After posting my most recent experience to /nosleep, reacknowledge his existence in my life. Turns out I was not crazy and this Shadow has been following me throughout my life whether I choose to believe it or not. At first I decided to write off the whole experience however, I felt /nosleep to be an output for my fright and anxiety.

My most recent experience with the ShadowMan was tonight... 08/10/11... this is the European format for you Americans :) (no offense).

It happened at around 8:30pm my girlfriend was curling her hair in the hallway

Anyway
Plans were going as expected

Then she calls my name... ""Eoin come here now!""

I replied ""Eh... ok... what's wrong?""

Anyway

I replied ""UUUUUUUh no......""
This was not the case she was whimpering at me saying that she saw the shadow of a man walk up the hall passed my room.....

I was really freaked out

I am genuinely freaked out /nosleep and am happy to answer all of your questions if you can also help answer mine.... What the fuck is following me!!!!

UPDATE:
This is something I posted last night on /nosleep and was suggested to crosspost it here by meglet. I was very tired posting the second part so ignore the crudeness and somewhat pointless aspects of the story... also ignore the more storylike format of the first post I did not realise this kind of subreddit existed.

This is a topic I offer up for discussion as these are both very recent experiences with a shadow person that I now know has been following me for as long as I can remember. 

I will offer to answer all questions. 

I would like to ask for your insights and what I can do to either stop these experiences or contact the shadow

It is now 11:55PM I will do my best to answer all questions in as much detail as possible tomorrow morning!

We are discussing haunted houses, a small smirk slowly working itself across his face

“Hey, let’s drive out to Morningstar Road and check out the barn where that guy got murdered.  We can bring candles and have a séance…”.  

*My blood slowly ran cold…*

*A few details are needed here for you to truly appreciate his statement.  First, with no embellishment.  Secondly, this was a small Midwestern town, where nothing like murder ever happens.  Third, this was an unusual, and very gruesome, murder.  A man from out of state was found just outside of town in an old abandoned barn, decapitated and, and footprints. Various arcane and satanic symbols were found painted on the ground and walls.  It was rumored that there were additional grisly details the detectives needed to omit, of when the actual murder was estimated to have taken place.*         

…the hairs stood up on the back of my neck.  As it happens for all of us in these situations, which I would now characterize as “gut instinct”.  Some piece of my still-forming adult judgment was telling me this is just bravado bullshit, fuck it, do not do this.  A thousand thoughts-- the murderers might decide to show up at the same time with another victim-- the police might be staking the place out on that same suspicion and arrest us!  I assess the overall situation, and decide that I’m falling behind in our “ranking” within our pack.  I cannot afford to appear weak now.  I make a snap decision.  Skip to real-time, the body and face under firm control.  My mouth opens, and words pour forth:

“That’s an awesome idea!  Let’s bring candles, god.  For good measure, I add, “Maybe there will even be blood or rope or something still there...”.

The other guys are still quiet, seems taken aback.  He did not expect anyone, myself especially, to take this baiting so readily.  His head bobs, smile widening, and yells, “YEAAAH  AHAHHA!!!” , saying it’s a “stupid way to spend Halloween night”.  Pssht, steeling my nerve and trying to appear enthusiastic at the commitment ahead.

Three days later, citing plans with a cousin or being grounded.  It’s down to me (the smart kid/class clown), my best friend “Alpha”, and two other guys—an antisocial skater and a goofy bass player.  Somehow, we end up deciding to go during the late afternoon instead of at midnight, so that we can go to a party later (and perhaps unspokenly, so that it’s not dark).

In the late afternoon, and head toward Morningstar road.  I roll down my window, the chill air feeling great, and my cigarette calming me.  The freshly cut soybean rows coruscate on either side of the road, hypnotic, and the sun flashes between the cloud-patched late afternoon sky.  We approach the turn for Morningstar road, a twisty, then right, about 300 feet off the road behind a thick cover of trees

I turn the car slowly down the old dirt drive, widening into a clearing.  I decide to park on a flat spot left of the drive about 150 feet away.  The remainder of the drive was brown dust and gravel, leading to a neglected clearing surrounding the barn.  The barn was of average size, very old, not a patch of paint remained on its exterior.  Small, sickly, half-dead trees and bushes surrounded the barn on all sides, rusted farming implement sat in the tall grass just left of the barn.  On the far right, darkness beyond.  

As I parked the car, some sick fuck took some poor son of a bitch down this driveway, probably dragged them or marched them at gunpoint, into this barn, and did unspeakably horrible things to them.  Bled them, terrified them.  Likely tortured the shit out of them.  And then murdered them.  This stunt isn’t brave.  It isn’t cool.  *This is foolish.*  *Disrespectful.*  *Wrong.*  Alpha and I exchanged glances, each knowing our role, our solidarity

*We are doing this.*  

We opened the car doors. He grabbed the olive drab army surplus bag of supplies.  We let the other two out.  We all stand there for a moment

“Creepy old piece of shit…”

“Big fucking deal.”, I muse to myself.

“Yeah, says Alpha.

The sun was a dull orange, we stride toward our goal.
We approach the barn, maybe a saw or a broken board.  There are some very old beer cans littering the ground, a couple of discarded pull tabs.  Footprints.  Long shadows, nearly twilight now.  The barn is—

I feel *something.*  My heart nearly stops—

A flurry of activity, I don’t know—

I’m ten feet away.  Alpha and Goof are in further in front of me

*&gt;Jump forward in time&gt;—*

Alpha grabs me, facial expression indescribable, scruffs my coat, whips me around.  Goof runs past us like he’s insane.  I return to the world.  Cold adrenaline hits me, but I don’t move.  Someone screams.  Is screaming AT ME.  What?—

I turn back around, eyes drawn to the barn’s roof.  As my eyes scan up, something slides DOWN.  A...moving shadow.  It slides off the roof, down the side of the barn as though falling.  It loudly rustles the bushes, as though a large object had fallen off the roof—SwishswishTHUMP!  I still have no idea what I am seeing.  I’m paralyzed, or my attention is completely rapt, no idea how to describe it.  Fear slowly registering now, semi-translucent, bipedal.  Glowing, left to right

Another hard jerk, back toward the car.  Skater is jerking on the passenger door, Goof is saying something to me.  I pat my pockets—

I recall a “jingle” during my run.  Goddamn.

“Droppedthekeys!  HEREHELPMELOOKwhere--!!”, gleaming in the dirt.  

Grabbed the keys.  Unlock door, I hit a log or something, keep going.  Tires squealing, huge plume of dust in my rearview, tearing down the road, fast.  Count of ten, normalcy returning, pounding in my neck.  I’m laughing hysterically.  Someone is babbling fuck NO fuck no fucking way NO WAY. Make eye contact with Alpha.  His face matching my own.  Disbelief.

Skater and Goof leave.  I don’t sleep that night, our stories nearly identical.  From his perspective, as we approached the barn, I stopped in my tracks.  He assumed I was lighting a cigarette or stalling, but chose not to shame me.  He continues on closer, then backs up after hearing a low, menacing growl, the same strange feeling hit him.  When he grabbed my collar and yelled at me

**He saw the shadow, he claimed it was not on the barn as I perceived, but in the grass, coming towards me.  He saw the shadow.  The eyes…**

And that, what would have happened?    

Since then


**Bonus Note:  As I said, and I am considered by most accounts to be a very rational, logical, science-minded individual.  Some of the details online concerning the actual murder are wrong.  They’re not consistent between sources.  For details of the actual murder story, search keywords, “William Anthony Ault”(RIP), “Jimmie Lee Penick” “murder”.  I’m pretty jaded, it’s been destroyed.

The building had a weird feeling about it but none of the permanent residents would admit this. One night I slept there I woke at about half three. I tried to get back to sleep

Eventually towards the end of the time the guys lived there I had become pretty friendly with Mick and after telling him about my shitty nights sleep he opened up a bit about the goings on at the house.

If you look at the plan

One of the artists who lived there for a couple of months slept there all the time. As she was trying to sleep one night she felt hands at the bottom of the bed. They slid over her feet onto her legs

Another guy who lived there at the time was a singer/songwriter. He was practicing one day in his room when from just behind his right ear he heard ""SHUT UP"".

He also claimed to have walked into the living room (the large room below the sex pest bedroom) to see about 10 people all sitting around. When he blinked they disappeared. There was a piano in this room that would play by 'itself' too.

Along with various other weirdness, no bullshit, rugged, manly man type. We were in living room having beers and chatting and he went down the hall, past the room, to the toilet. When he came back he immediately and directly asked Mick if the place was haunted. He never said what he saw or did not see, but he knew.

  This incident happened a couple of days after my sons first birthday (April 2009).  Like a lot of kids
  Our house at the time was a two story cape cod built in 1938 and moved from its original lot in the '60's to where it was when we bought it.  When you walk in the front door there was a little foyer, our sons room and a bathroom were on the second floor.  
  So, it just kind of hovered a foot above the bed right between us.  It was a little creepy, but we were both tired so we pushed the balloon away and fell asleep.  When we woke up the next morning the balloon was on the floor in our sons room.
  I know this story doesn't sound very creepy, traveled from our foyer by the front door to our room upstairs and finally come to rest in our bathroom.  It would have had to drop under two doorways (about 20ft from front door to the small hallway), make a 90 degree left turn and go about 5ft to the stairway.   It would then have to make 90 degree right turn and go up about 12 flights of stairs to a landing and another 3 steps to our main level upstairs.  Then somehow, it was able to make it into our room against the force of an industrial fan on high blowing out the door.  To us, the physics of the whole situation didn't make sense.  Since that day, we have chalked it up to my sister saying she was there and saying happy birthday to her god-son.  Sorry to ramble...I'm not the writer in the family, my sister was.

In my last post, on the off chance that someone else reading this has been there as well. This was mostly to preserve the accuracy of what I, or someone else, was remembering. 

Recent events have changed my position on this

I had the chance encounter to see lots of people I knew

Another friend of mine had been there. She described things in elaborate detail

Not only that, an ocean, a jungle, and a desert. 

The desert was of particular interest, between two cliffsides, in a valley. The buildings were carved out of stone, much like desert dwelling Native Americans. The unique trait about this city was that everything, literally, was a shop, even the homes. You could wander everywhere

One of the common traits was that the different realms had different rules, my friends who had been tehre described that they radically changed, and became more animal like. One changed into some creature that could navigate through the trees easily, another changed into something that could travel through the underbrush. 

In the realms it seemed that there were local people that lived there. The Jungle had more aboriginal residents. The Manor had dusty

Some areas had some sort of large, another did not. 

One of the unifying feelings that everyone got when they were there was this sense that it was very, and they said that this acted totally different. They could not do whatever they wanted or change what was happening. 

Also, similar to a golf course. Another would start off in a dilapidated house that was near The Manor. 

The friend whom I had not talked to about this beforehand also said that she had made several maps of the areas. When she described how to get from one realm to another

She also mentioned that she figured out how to get there

I'm going to try to get back there. For some reason, whether in The Market or in The Manor.

1367473651.0,1djb72,A Man We Called Umbra,burntflowersfallen,23,7,8,"   This will be rather medium length of a story because it was something that didn't happen for too long of a time period it was just over the summer three years ago and it's still just as confusing to me to this day. So my friend Nash and I both started having these really weird dreams where we would see this ""being"" that looked like a man almost but there was just something really off about him that didn't seem human-like at all. Before telling each other what 'he' looked like we both did kinda shitty drawings of what we had seen in our dreams and then compared them. This is where I started to get really creeped out.

  We both had drawn this really thin faced pale man with black eyes and long stringy black hair and then when we talked about it we both would see him in the dreams were he sort of just ascended from the shadows and would watch us from the edge of the darkness. He never said a single word to either of us it was just a dream of him watching us moving around the edge of the darkness. 

   For me personally it never moved past dreams except on occasion I'd feel really uncomfortable like someone was watching me and then Nash told me he started to see the 'man' in real life and that one night when we were texting he walked to the kitchen and glimpsed him standing outside his sliding glass door in the room next to the kitchen. He said it happened a couple times where at night he'd see him standing outside his house. I honestly don't know all the details of those times though because we just kind of dropped the subject because we were both so freaked out by it. We ended up calling 'him' Umbra I honestly don't even remember why. 

   So to this day it drives me crazy wondering what the hell this thing was and was there maybe some way we were just sharing some crazy dream that turned into a hallucination for him?

Full disclosure, but I swear that this is not fiction and I'm completely open to explanations. 

""John"" and ""Charlotte"" (two of my bestest buds who happen to date each other) came over and the three of us got sushi at a restaurant around the corner from my apartment.

Our waitress was not the brightest bulb in the tool box, and our tips reflected our feelings about the service. (Note: We did tip her. She’s fine. She can still pay for rent.)

We left to go to Walgreens in the hopes of finding some sparkling apple cider. I had told them that it was fine for them to drink even if I was going to abstain, and we started to walk past this restored Victorian house that we’d been speculating about from the restaurant. It looks like the gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, and we had joked about who would get the tower room if we all lived in it like a giant fairy-tale family.

From behind John, “Excuse me?” Now, John is a tall dude. I couldn’t see who was behind him, and we were only about 100 feet from the restaurant, so my immediate thought was that it was our waitress about to yell at him for his tip. It turned out to be a different woman.

“Sorry to bother you

I started laughing (partly from relief), apologetic, saying that the lighter hadn’t worked, and John bent down to light her cigarette. And on we continued to Walgreens.

They didn’t have sparkling cider. They did have flu shots, and then drew out his hand, puzzled. He tried his other pocket.

“Hold on, he’d been showing off his new, compact wallet–no folds, just slots for cards on either side of a small leather rectangle. He reached into his coat pockets, outer and inner, convinced that he’d slipped it in there somewhere, or that it had slipped into the lining of his coat from a pocket since it was so little.

John didn’t find it in his coat, but he does tend to misplace things, especially car keys, so I wasn’t too concerned. We’d come a total of three blocks from where he’d last used his wallet, so I figured that even if he couldn’t find it on his person, it couldn’t have gone far. John dug through his bag, getting more flustered

Pharmacy was a bust. He’d checked his bag and all pockets several times. We concluded that he must have left it at the restaurant, and even with descriptions of us and of the table we’d been sitting at, she didn’t know what was going on. Finally John just said, “You know, it’s fine, we’re actually almost there, I’ll just come look.” Meanwhile

We didn’t see anything, so Charlotte and I stood at the front in, as you can imagine, no awkwardness at all. John returned, shaking his head. Nothing. The waitress/hostess looked completely blank when we asked if it could have been on a plate that got carried off or stuck in the check billfold. It was the other waiter who answered that they unfold the check carriers immediately and that they would have found anything inside.

John was bummed. Luckily for him, along with his debit and credit cards, and he wasn’t looking forward to canceling and replacing all of them. Trying to cheer him up with dark humor, Charlotte and I started to speculate about whether or not the seemingly-dumb waitress were actually a master thief, or if the woman who’d asked for a cigarette had been a pickpocket. We didn’t seriously think she had been; John and she had never actually gotten too physically close, and his peacoat had been covering his pants pockets, where he’d remembered putting the wallet.

Char and I began to walk faster than John, and as he told us later, his only thought was a prayer (an atheist’s prayer) to find this wallet.

Then, “GUYS!”

We turned around

I jogged back to him. “Awesome! Where did you find it?”

As I approached John

“It hit my leg

“…okay

He was shaking his head. “No

We looked around. There was no one anywhere near us. You could easily see around the corner–no one there. No one had been there. There aren’t a lot of people hanging out on my street at 9:15pm on a Friday. The house had some little bushes

“Right

One pocket, and although the pocket of his coat had a hole, the lining did not. Meaning that even if the wallet had slipped into that hole (which was not big enough for it anyway), it would have remained trapped in the lining of his coat. His bag was securely sealed with no holes in it.

This is where both my face and Charlotte’s started to look a lot like John’s.

Somehow, a substantial distance away from any other people and with very few plausible explanations accounting for it having fallen off his person.

In front of a witch’s fairy-tale house by which we had done a mysterious stranger a favor.

We high-tailed it home, “Well, I still don’t believe in God.”

***
We went home and Googled Angelology for laughs, and to get an additional light). By fulfilling these, John won himself a boon. When he walked by the same place again, thinking madly that all he wanted was his wallet, she delivered--by chucking his wallet at him.

Obviously she's not serious with that

The event happened between 2005-2006.  My father had come to pick me and my sister up and take us to visit him in Childress
 
We ended up taking the backroad between Matador and Childress
 
Off to my right, I am by no means a stereotypical ""city boy"".  I am familiar with a good deal of livestock and farming equipment.  This was something new.  Still, given that I am admittedly no expert in the field, I simply assumed that this was some newfangled contraption.   
 
I didn't see it for very long
 
We winded down and I lost sight of the field and the mystery object.  It was the perfect twilight time in which I first saw the object, but I can assure you all that what I saw then was nothing like I saw the first time around. 
 
There were lights in the field, ""well, maybe that is the source of the lights.""  I was content to let it go, but the lights began to hover before I could turn away.  I watched in awe as we motored down the road, briefly stunned to silence.  As the lights hovered further off the ground, I came to my senses. 
 
I shouted ""Dad
 
When he responded
 
We both stared at the object as it rose further into view.  My father did not have to worry about splitting his attention between the road and the object long
 
It was hovering just out of the reach of our headlights (I think), we never would have known it was there.  And there it was.   
 
The light-outlined thing filled our windshield.  Given the size of the field I had seen it in, was easily 200 yards across.  The thing was massive.  Despite its incredible bulk, the craft was agile, for as we drove, the craft (or its pilots) proved to be aware of us as they stayed directly in front of us, matching our speed (roughly 60 mph) and turned with us at every twist and bend of the road.   
 
As this went on for what felt like a few minutes (I did not have the foresight to check my watch, it abruptly took off.  In the literal blink of an eye, the craft was dozens of miles away, if not more.   
 
For those of you unfamiliar with the Texas skyline, went from filling our windshield view to being only a hand span in the distance.  As I watched, the thing was gone entirely in seconds. 
 
I cannot accurately fathom the speed at which the craft had to accelerate
 
If not for the presence of my little sister (aged roughly 6-7 at the time)
 
My father and I talk about it occasionally and lament my lack of recording device at the time (I have had a camera phone for that very reason ever since).  My sister doesn't remember much about the ordeal
 
My father has pointed out that Sheppard Air Force base isn't too far (well, ""hey, let's scare the piss out of some farmer"".  When I told the story to an acquaintance in Army intelligence, he wouldn't say anything other than ""we have shit even you wouldn't believe"".  Take it for what it's worth.

1361317497.0,18umox,My chat with my cousin who passed away in 2007,Skooter_McGaven,23,6,7,"This is a x/post from r/nosleep. A another redditor suggested I post this here. 

My cousin lived out in Missouri with her brother
In 2007 she was killed in a car accident. She was the passenger in her boyfriends car and he was driving like an asshole. He ended up being fine but she got hit on her door and passed away at the hospital a couple hours later. Needless to say

It really destroyed me on the inside. All of my Aunts ( we have a big family) on my moms side

I grew up catholic and never really questioned it. I wasn't really religious but I didn't really refute it. When my cousin passed away I stopped believing in any of it because I felt she was stolen from our lives and if there was a god then why would he ever do something like that to us.

In May of 2011 I asked my long time girlfriend to marry me. When we got engaged my fiance's dream was to get married in the church that she went to her whole life. We both went to the nearby catholic school (different grades) and she loved that church. She is not very religious but does believe in God. I told her that I did not want to get married in church because I no longer believed in it and was kind of angry at the whole thought. I figured if there is a god

A little side track backstory. As I said my aunt is pretty religious. She is probably the most religious out of our family even after losing her daughter. So one day, my aunt and other cousin even got a tattoo of it. Everytime we see a yellow butterfly it makes our family a little at peace.

Fast forward a couple a months:
I am lying in my bed trying to sleep and I start to get this weird feeling. Something was not right, I can't really explain it past that. My eyes were wide open and it was just there. The voice started to tell me that it was my cousin. She told me three things:
That I had to get married in a church. She told me the only way she would be able to see me get married was if I got married in a church.
She told me to draw my aunt a picture (I draw as a hobby). In my head I vividly saw the picture to draw.

She simply told me '69'. The immature kid in me giggled a little bit but she told me that it would make sense and verify that I was really talking to her. She said the number represented something big and I would understand. That part of the message was told over and over again to me.

Needless to say this shook me up when it ended. I couldn't stop crying that night. It just brought back a lot of pain and I honestly chalked it up to just myself making it up but I wasn't convinced of that either.
This bothered me for quite awhile. I searched through the articles of the car accident searching for some representation of 69. I looked at her name
Eventually I gave up but I told my mom about what happened. A couple days later she wrote me a letter explaining how my aunt and uncle went on their walk...and at the end of it she wrote y-e-l-l-o-w (6) b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y (9)....

After that it pretty much verified to me that I did actually talk to her. I eventually did get married in a church and drew my aunt the picture. I am not any more religious but I am glad I got married in the church. I don't know if God exists or heaven or any of that stuff but no one will ever convince me I didn't talk to my cousin.

After my mom discovered what it meant I told my fiance and she told me about a dream she had a week before I was visited. Mind you that she never met my cousin but did see pictures. She told me she had very simple dream with my cousin it telling her everything was going to work out and not to worry about the church. She didn't tell me about it before because she didn't want to upset me. Needless to say i know who I talked to that night.

 At this time, we found some particularly thick poison ivy. After a bit of hack and slas, we found that a large tree branch had fallen in the middle of the ivy recently, so we could make it through the ivy without the hack and slash if we walked over it. 

So there we were, and saw what appeared to be a person, running. The thing is though, it was completely black and had no shadow. It was basically a living shadow. i only saw it for maybe 2 seconds before it was gone, running away into the bush. Although i remember it all really clearly. I think time must have slowed as the adrenaline kicked in. I asked my friend behind me if he had seen it. He looked scared and worried and said no. I asked my friend directly in front of me. He too, had seen nothing. I wanted to run after it and see where it went, but my friends were keen at this stage to continue on home

My family has a few strange stories so I thought I'd post them up for you. I'll begin with mine then I'll post up my families in another post so it's not like a massively huge bunch of text. These are true

Anyway


**Mine**

**Sleep paralysis**

When I was about 10 I used to have an animal visit me when I slept at my fathers house. While I was drifting off I would hear the jingling of a collar and then something would jump onto my bed about the size and weight of a small to medium dog. When I would try to open my eyes I would find that I couldn't, feeling really calm and thought to myself 'why was I ever so scared of this?' I posted a longer detailed account of this in *nosleep*, should have put it in here but I didn't realise this forum existed till the other day.

Interestingly to anyone who happened to read that post I remembered while talking to my boyfriend the other day that I used to see dogs walking up to me out of the corner of my eye during a stage in my life where I was grieving for my grandmother. I even went to shoo one out of the cafe I worked in only to realise there wasn't a dog there after all.


**Float**

I used to live in a terrace house in Northcote, it looked like the pile of clothes I was folding were floating just off the edge of my drawers. When I turned around they fell to the floor. Nothing like this happened again.


**kittens**

In the same house we had a toy cat named Puddin'. She was tiny, she wasn't spayed. There was a crazy cat lady a couple of doors down that had multitudes of ferals and Puddin' unfortunately ended up pregnant. Anyway, the night came where she was birthing so we set up a bed for her in the bathroom and let nature take its course. Being a kid I was really excited, kittens! And mini kittens if Puddin' was anything to go by at that! I sat up really late reading in my room. Our house used to have an outhouse and when they renovated they put down flooring and extended a hallway out to the bathroom so there was a window in my room that looked into here. At around 2-3am I got really weirdly creeped out and looked dubiously at this window, I saw a black hooded shadow slip past made up of a kind of solid smoke. I sat frozen barely breathing for a long while after but it never walked back the other way and I didn't hear anything after that. In the morning we went to check on my cat and her kittens and found the babies were all still born. Puddin' was fine. 


**Grandma**

I was working in an icecream parlour at the time I was grieving for my grandmother. I was standing in the corner of the shop staring off into space thinking about her and feeling deeply disturbed when a smell caught my attention. It was her perfume she used to always get from Avon. No customers were in the store and the kitchen staff didn't wear perfume to work as it was against the rules so I wonder if it was her trying to comfort me as I always used to watch her put it on when I was 6 and then she'd give me a little squirt on my wrists and show me how to dab it on your pulse points. I loved that woman.


**Bulk**

I live with my boyfriend now in the suburbs in Victoria. His house has a history of little incidents which I'll post with his families experiences. I woke up in the middle of the night really groggy. I was flitting between awake and asleep and I put my hand on his side and was patting him. My partner is pretty lean and light on muscle bulk but as I was patting him it was like someone else was laying in the bed with me. The person I had my arm around had built up muscles and was much broader than my boyfriend. I was super lethargic but I batted it off and half sat up calling his name concerned


**Shadow**

A couple of months ago my partner and I were bedding down. I turned the light off so he could go to sleep and began my nightly ritual of playing on my iphone until I get drowsy. By the time I was locking my phone my boyfriend was asleep. I closed my eyes for a minute and after a moment got really anxious. I opened my eyes and in the corner of our room

One night in 1989 my dad decided to call it a night and head to the bedroom for a good nights sleep. Little did he know about the traumatic experience which he would remember for the rest of his life.

He was sleeping on his back with his arms folded on top of his chest and there was a shelf attached to a wall directly above his head. For some reason, although he said that it felt like somebody was watching him. Eventually, he opened his eyes, and that's when he saw it. There was a pale white being's face looking directly at him. He told me that the only way he could describe it was like a typical [alien grey](http://www.unidentified-flying-objects.net/grey-alien-photo.gif.) It had big, black eyes and an almost undefinable nose.

The reason why I previously explained that there was a shelf attached to a wall behind him was because it would make it physically impossible for this being to be leaning over him. If this thing wasn't a figment of his imagination then how could it be standing inside of a wall?

Anyway, still seeing this pale face standing over him. His heart was racing and he didn't know what to do. He was helpless.

After a few heart pounding minutes he managed to find the ability to move one of his toes. He began to wriggle it as much as he could and closed his eyes again, mainly because it had never done it before. He was brave about it and headed straight back to his bed to continue sleeping.

Now this is where it gets a little creepier. My dad never told anybody about what happened that night. He was too busy thinking about what it could have been and why he wasn't able to move. He looked into alien abductions and all sorts of other similar night terrors.

A week later, in his eyes, unexplainable. There, standing in the middle of his room, was a ""pale, white, spindly figure with big

I adhere to a more scientific notion of 'ghosts'. Meaning I don't believe that there is a theological answer to paranormal occurrences but rather a scientific avenue that hasn't been discovered or a fluke of nature. These beliefs apply not only to 'ghosts' but to all of my views on the paranormal.

Unfortunately, I can only work in conjecture and experience. 

My own experiences and understanding of the things around me leads me to believe that ghosts are a sort of conscious residue of sorts. As though the conscious self has been left behind after death due to some type of anomaly. I have had my share of strange experiences and some of which have caused me to completely discard my previous understandings and start anew.

1341168786.0,vvzjk,Not sure what happens here,cgunner,21,5,5,"Everything I write below is completely true

When I was 14, about eight years ago. We were all in our trailer (we were building the house at the time, it was previously vacant property) and I was getting ready for bed. I was just about to close the blinds by my bed, when as i'm looking outside, a light sweeps and crosses the adjacent hill. Like someone was walking up to it with a really bright flash light. I told everyone what I saw so everyone else went to the window, and it happened again, for everyone to see. We were creeped the hell out now. We all go outside to look and see if there is a person out there (we thought maybe the neighbor who lived half a mile away had walked over or something) no one. Also, about a foot deep

Later (I don't remember when as this was about 8 years ago, (where we were looking) I asked my brother if he saw it, and he said he had. It was a clear evening, and the sun had gone down over the mountains, an there was no inclement whether anywhere in sight. We brushed it off and kept going. 

Things become a bit jumbled in my memory

Another occasion, I hear a very deep growl. Almost like a animal/human, but nothing discernibly came from it, just sound. I looked around and didn't see anything or anyone (remember I'm 20 miles from the nearest payphone, 8 miles from the nearest paved road.) It was utterly quiet around me. I felt bothered and walked faster, and I now avoid being outside at night here. 

One particular occasion annoyed the shit out of me. My car key, disappeared. I always ritualistically put it on my desk when I get home, well, one morning it was just gone. I mean absolutely gone, I felt like I was going crazy (and this isn;t the first time I've had things go missing, I never got my retainers back that also went missing) After looking everywhere, EVERYWHERE, but what could we do? Well, even her expected a response. The next morning, no key was there. Jump forward about 10 hours when we all arrived home. She went to her closet like always

As a general rule here, the pump would stop working, but at no other time did it do that. Random luck? Possibly I guess, but unlikely in conjunction with everything else. Smoke alarms with perfectly good batteries would go off, being set off by one room or another. Our washer electric parts have all gone out six times. 

Many things happen such as a picture falling off the wall, had no reason to fall. Bottle cap thrown on the floor (shoved maybe?) Constant footsteps in the house at night, when no one is up. Talking, light whispers, normal talking etc. I've actually laid in my bed and heard a man and woman talking in our downstairs. Our downstairs is a daylight basement, that no one in my family EVER uses at night, and barely in the day. It's unfinished and mostly a storage area. I often feel watched from right outside my window, that literally can be felt in bed. The list goes on and on. We constantly have things disappear

I was actually laying in bed one night, just so I could cast aside any noises from that point forward, as the movie. 

One very strange night, awake in bed. My girlfriend at the time had stayed over, and being in an unfinished house, my mom didn't have her door on yet, but she had hung a sheet in the doorway fro privacy, because we had company (my gf) anyways, that night my mom woke up to sobbing noises, just an absolute sadness. A deep sobbing, pulled the sheet back to step out, and felt like something was looking at me from my open doorway. I rolled over and buried my face into my sleeping GF shoulder

We have cats and on one occasion, growling, with his hair standing up, then he came flying up the stairs into our great room. later, about 2 days later, the other cat, was sitting on the last landing before the stairs descended into the basement door, staring into a visibly empty door. What the fuck was it? Again

A very recent occurrence, and the dogs were all laying around her on the floor. My dad left the room, to go outside, he came back about 5 mins later, and found the door deadbolted. My mom was there and didn't see anything, and neither did the dogs. 

There's more things to add, I'll update this post as more things happen.

When I was 3 years old, WA, and was generally creepy, basement in particular. Weird things happened: My Mom and Dad saw a strange flash of light in the kitchen once, as though a flashbulb were going off (according to them) but there was no explanation for the flash. We heard smashing, breaking noises in the basement, but when my parents would go downstairs to check it out, she thought she felt something touch her foot

Once, who I told her was the old man. 
I have a vague memory of this old man in the basement

After this, asked the neighbors about who had lived there before us, and it turns out an old man had died in the house!

Another of my memories is of playing with my cousin in the field behind an apartment building where I lived. I must have been around 6 years old. Across the field was a chain link fence that we avoided because sometimes, but then he would disappear, only to reappear a little while later. 

Even as a child, but I never questioned myself about what that meant, my child's brain accepted my intuitive response for what it was, nothing more or less. 

I spoke to my cousin recently and asked her if she remember the man by the fence

You might chalk it up to childish nonsense, I felt that some immaterial truth had been confirmed in my mind, and it gave me chills. 

Another time, and the stick would move one way for yes, and another way for no. The stick was shaped in such a way that it could rock on its curve in two different possible directions; to and fro or back and forth.

Allow me to say that the wind was not blowing, and the movements of the stick were too precise in correlation to the answers of the questions to be accidental. The questions were stupid kiddy type questions.  

I actually did not think much of this memory until just a few years ago, taken for granted. But now I want to know: how was that stick moving on its own? Why was a stick answering our questions? What put it into our minds that if we posed a question to the stick, that 'something' would answer? Why does this memory seem strange to me now, when I had accepted it without thought for years beforehand?

Fast forward a few years. My mom and I are living in a different apartment, when I look up from the hall in to my bedroom. I was not expecting (obviously) to see anything out of the ordinary, but standing in the center of my bedroom, directly within my line of sight, was a solid black outline of a person! My heart jumped and I can absolutely still remember feeling a sharp frisson of horror that someone was in my bedroom, but as soon as this registered in my brain, the person was gone, they went home and didn't come back over again. Also

I have told this story many times

I'll conclude this post with a creepy story that was passed down to me from my Mom and Auntie. 

When they were kids, she used to hate to do the dishes in the evenings because she always had the irrational fear that something was peeking over the edge of the roof at her. She said she would do those damn dishes as fast as she could so she could get out from under that creepy feeling of being watched. 

When I asked my Mom why she never shared this feeling with her own Mom

Years later after they had grown up and moved far away from that house, my Auntie would run like hell through the kitchen to the bathroom at night, because she always felt like something was peeking over the edge of the roof at her through the kitchen window.

1331909341.0,qzf3o,My Husband's Experiences,Sigatsu,20,3,3,"My husband is completely skeptically about anything paranormal. He’s mildly amused by all the paranormal TV shows out there and says that some of the “evidence” they show intrigues him.

As a child he had two experiences that still stick with him. Once when he was a young child

He played with his shadow

Hubby said that it scared him shitless and he ran from the room. He never played with his shadow again.

As an adult, wouldn’t it just keep moving fast and then stop as the image faded?”

He didn’t know why and just shrugged it off.

The next time something strange happened to him was when he was a few years older

This was in a different house.

My Hubby and his brother shared a bedroom and a bed

One night they were talking too loudly and suddenly saw a shadow in the doorway. They thought it was their older brother who was in the next room sleeping. He would usually come over and tell them to shut up or he’d punch them.

So

They both freaked and hid under the covers.

My husband says when he looked back on the incident he realized the shadow was nearly as tall as the doorway

He says he can’t explain that one but maybe they were both hallucinating because they knew they weren’t supposed to be awake goofing around on a school night. They KNEW their older brother usually came in the room and threatened to beat them if they didn’t go to sleep. So maybe

Many years later

I didn’t know this then but about 8 years ago

He answered but I didn’t answer back. He sat there for a second listening and then realized I was sleeping in our bedroom which was on the other side of the house in the back.

Of course 

He says he’s not ashamed to say it gave him the chills and he immediately shut down the computer and went to bed.

To this day he insists he probably was just very tired and hallucinating.
 
I don’t know…maybe he was.

I was woken suddenly in the night and lay still, but I'd instantly gone into 'alert mode' and was listening for any sound - some clue as to why I'd woken so suddenly and felt so on edge.

The silence went unbroken, it formed a tall black human shape, and I could hear it's footsteps on the wood flooring. They were getting closer as I lay there and listened in wide-eyed horror.

As the steps passed the open bathroom doorway right outside my bedroom, this was something else - something that was here to protect me. I obeyed, slamming my eyelids together as the footsteps crossed the threshold from the wooden floor to the carpeted bedroom and stopped beside the bed.

I could feel the malevolence radiating in the room - the thing seemed to be searching for me. As ridiculous as this sounds

I know that this sounds a bit iffy - especially with most of it being experienced through a sort of instinctive knowledge of what was happening and pictures in my head.

Many people maintain that there are multiple universes.  We need 11 of them to explain String Theory.  But what if there are more?  Infinite universes.  One that carries on a history for each decision everyone makes?

Let me discuss time for a second, formed, molded, ripped apart and put back together in any way it chooses.  It literally moves according to our perceptions of it, so couldn't the DIRECTION it moves be perceived as well?  So why our perceptions?  In terms of relativity, why does it seem like flirting with an attractive person takes two minutes, whereas sitting on a hot stove for the same amount of time feel like two hours?  Why is it in our perceptions?

That's what brings me back to the infinite universes.  In the time we experience earth and life, before that scenario plays out, I jump imperceptibly to a universe where I make it to the store and go about my day.  Maybe my friends stay in that original universe and mourn their dead friend, or maybe they all shift with me and call me to remind me to pick up some Mountain Dew.  

So how does this tie into paranormal?  What if those shifts between universes aren't so smooth all the time?  Perhaps the spectres we see are people shifting universes

-----------------------
About 4 or 5 years ago, and it seemed like the easiest to get to late at night.

Since land is scarce, depending on how slow you drive.
At the base of the mountain, but being Freshmen or Sophomores we hadn't really taken it seriously--we all still scoffed at the ghost stories our local friends would tell us about. But per usual, it was a beautiful and clear night.

As we slowly ascended up the mountain, it wasn't a big deal. We could make out some of the chinese writing from the car as the light hit it. After we got further up the mountain, we noticed people running away from us. It looked like an innocent game of hide and seek, and being Friday the 13th we assumed we couldn't have been the only people who had this idea. Then we noticed every person was wearing red. As soon as the light hit a tombstone, we'd see someone wearing red dart off into the darkness. And it happend every time, to each tombstone the headlights caught. 

We were expecting to get to the top to encounter some cars and mischievous teens, heading to this pagoda. There would be no place for anyone to run off to once at the top.

We sort of freaked out at that point and jumped into the car and started our descent. Again we saw people wearing red running away from us, though we noticed no one ran from tombstones that we already saw on the ascent. They were definitely people, but they weren't all wearing the same thing, but the color was definitely red. They ran away too quickly to notice any detail, but we all noticed that there was no trace of them once the headlight was gone. They simply vanished as soon as the headlight hit another tombstone.

It was like each soul was just sitting in front of their pillar, or timidness. I felt guilty for disturbing their peace for a childish yearning.

In the past, smiley faces in the microwave, things like that.  And I'm hoping against hope that what has happened to and around me is just a slight lack of sleep and an over active imagination.

It's summer where I live, when it's not too hot, and stay up all night and do my thing; baking, cleaning, drawing and writing.  Now, of those things I usually spend most of my time on either Facebook or DeviantArt, so I'm always on the computer.

Recently, moths, wasps, beetles, and spiders have made their way into the house.  Not a big deal, just kill them or catch them and stick them outside.  But last night, there seemed to be an abnormal amount of bugs in the house after my boyfriend fell asleep

I had all the windows open, all for the same reason.  Bugs.  Of course, now I can ""feel"" them everywhere; crawling up my legs, tickling the back of my neck, when it's really just a cord or my hair.

Another thing that happened that makes me believe that something's not right here is the lemon.  My boyfriend absolutely loves iced tea with a slice of lemon in it.  I had moved across the living room, there was the lemon slice on the seat of the couch, right where I was going to sit.  I put it back in his glass.

Last night, when I got the distinct feeling that something wasn't right.  My boyfriend was asleep and our other roomie was asleep in his room in the basement.  I was the only one up.  

I had opened the windows, when I heard a creak from the kitchen.  It was just a little sound, like someone had dropped a needle on the counter or something.  I figured the cookie sheet had warped in the oven, or a plate shifted in the sink.  I went into the kitchen and got the pita bread out of the oven, started a new batch and started dishes.  I stuffed the towel through the cupboard's handle and left the room.

When I came back a few minutes later, cursing my short term memory and went back to the living room.  My boyfriends guitar was leaning against the wall, and when I walked in, it twanged at me.

Anyway, broken into two areas) that have really left me questioning things since they happened.

The first was when I still lived with my mother out in the middle of the woods. I never liked the area

From the time we moved in, I ended up getting no sleep at all, because there was an odd tapping under my floor the entire night.

For a while

However, like seeing things in the corner of my eye. I brushed it off at first, because I was naturally on edge being on my own all the time (my mother worked all day and drunk all night) and expected to be a little wigged out. Gradually, I realize that what I was seeing out of the corner of my eyes were in the shape of animals and people. Nothing serious, just like someone had walked by quickly when I was turned away. It became more frequent over time, and often I would leave for the neighbor's house when I got too freaked out. Apparently, this was normal around spring time. 

This culminated in two separate happenings

One was the night I had my friend over for the first time. We were returning from my neighbor's house, when my friend stops, and starts staring into the wooded area next to it. I ask her what's going on, and she points to a spot not too far away where there seems to be a white light sort of hovering around. Being two thirteen-year-olds alone at night in a heavily wooded area, we haul butt straight down the driveway and to my house.

The second took place shortly after I changed to the bedroom across the hall from my original one.

I woke suddenly at about four a.m. one morning, and thus wide awake. I'd settled back on my bed to read until I got tired again. Suddenly, there was an odd clanging noise from under my bed, which made no sense, because I'd been told there were no pipes located beneath the room I was in for whatever reason. Out of nowhere, my bed starts shaking like crazy. Not my room, just my bed.

Needless to say

There weren't any real big incidents after that. I'd have small things, but seeing no one when she looked out the sliding door to the patio.

I did have the experience of going back to my original room when I went back for a visit (I'd moved because the room made me uncomfortable




The second series of incidents occurred about three or so years later

Now, we bought the house *ourselves*, newly built so there was nothing odd with it that I could find. The house did not prove to be any sort of issue! The road outside of it, on the other hand, was very much one.

What threw me off about this one was how suddenly things started. I'd lived there for a good year before

See, and then finally turn onto the third one, and wait at the streetlight in the middle. Did this every day, no problem.

But one day, and turn around to see what they want. No one. Street is dead. So I chalk it up to my imagination and keep going. Next few days, everything is normal.

Then, and the growl of a dog. My neighbors seemed to hate keeping their dogs in their own yards, so dodging angry canines is something I'm used to. But when I go to jerk out of the way as soon as I hear the sound of movement, there's nothing solid. Instead I see what looks like a shadowy outline of an animal run by and disappear. Naturally, I freak out, turn right around and run the short distance home in tears.

After that day

But the weirdest thing was how it was confined to only that one street. I never saw *anything* on the other or the street my bus picks me up on. Very quickly, unfortunately, though I haven't seen anything since.

I got up straight away to look

Now
When I got up in the morning

My fiancé was still asleep

I knew it had to be paranormal

This worked for a while

The first week or so of being here, she shrugged it off. I, however, began to worry.
The next week something else happened. I had had a long day

The big electric frying pan was sitting on top of the glass cutting board. My cat was sleeping in my lap

Again
I jumped up

There, despite being thrown with considerable force onto the slate floor.

Shocked, when the cutting board had evidently fallen from underneath it somehow? Spooked, I picked my cat (Jungle) up and went back to bed.

Things quietened down for a few months
It was 2am, but I began staring out the door into the lounge room. As I was staring something black walked quickly past the door. Needless to say, I was terrified! I don't often actually see spirits, more often I just feel and hear them (perhaps because I try to block them out), so this is why I was so terrified.
I just hugged my cat to my chest and prayed to the goddess. Eventually

The next night I was home alone at the same time when I heard the most terrifying sound. An unmistakable sound. Moaning, comforting me and staring at the closet.

The next day I asked my sister if anything scares her here, a man stands by her door and just stares at her. She reassured me that this doesn't really bother her, though.

To add to this, and the corner of the handle broke off. It wasn't even anywhere near the edge. Locked doors would open. My bedroom door almost always swung back and forth, sometimes very very fast and sometimes it was barely noticeable.

So my grandma was young when she got married, drink, dance etc.) Finally, a young man came up to her, (about 4 years older) asking to dance, who ended up being my grandfather. They had the love-bug, ya know falling in love, going places

Everything goes well until my grandpa started staying away from their house more, he was cheating on her, and/or pimping out the town whore. This was truthfully a really big ordeal and had an everlasting impact on the family. My grandma was left a single mother with two children aged 7 and 3, and my grandfather was left with the town whore. Both of them did not want it to be this way, but from what my grandmother tells me- he was stuck with her, meaning she had him trapped in some way. (I'm sorry I'm not giving you more information but I wish I knew the whole story as well. All I know is that what happened was a very big deal.)

Their lives go on, besides having another short marriage in the late 80's, and my grandfather is still with the same woman, having 2 more children. This is 45 years later. 

One day my mother is over my grandmother's house for no reason, and not purposely but just because she was over it and it was the past. She hasn't ever had a dream like that or of that ever.

My mother explained to her that my grandfather had a heart-attack the same night as the dream and went through triple-bypass heart surgery. 

Is it really a coincidence that this happened on the same night? My theory is that we have some unknown sense that we can't consciously trigger or use.. Something was communicated in both of their minds sending some type of message between each other while my grandfather was on his deathbed

I have experienced many amazing situations due to this need of courage: I have slept nights under the stars on the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails. I've crossed the United States twice opting to sleep at sometimes isolated rest stops instead of hotels. I explored off the beaten path foreign countries to maintain that I was strong enough to face the world.

I say all this because, that I can never explain. It isn't necessarily scary. I wasn't afraid at the time of the experience, but I am still afraid to remember it. Sometimes I'm curious if all my fears are derived from this moment.

I grew up in rural Central Georgia (U.S.A.) on a small soybean farm. My father had chosen to build his home on a dirt road less than a quarter of a mile from his parents; my grandparents. I spent most of my summer days with my grandmother as it was a free source of childcare. I was not an easy kid to handle behaviorally. I talked back

I vividly remember being 5 years old; an age not easily recalled. I remember it as if it were a dream from the night before.

On this particular day, imagining for what purpose they might be used.

Over my shoulder towards the kitchen doorway where my grandmother would be, because eventually I turned around to look behind me.

In the doorway stood a man. The exposed skin of his body looked red: a deeper

This man

After a moment of naive thought I stand and follow to where I had seen this copper-skinned man. I am now standing in the doorway to the kitchen visible to my grandmother; and also where the vision had stood. I look expecting to see him in the parlor-like area beyond the dining area. To my confusion the man was outside of the house. Seen through the panes of glass in a closed window. He was disappearing into the soybean stalks.

""Jon. You ok?"" my grandmother called me back to reality. 

My memory fails me here yet again. I can't recall if I asked her then and there if she had seen the man

I do remember being still young and forming my first concepts of Native Americans and having these events spur terrifyingly back into my consciousness. 

Harvesting soybeans with my grandfather in a combine tractor one afternoon we drove over a dry

The dry spot

I don't remember being afraid of the events that day until later in life. I grew into the fear as I pieced together, that may have existed previously. 

The fear that I still battle today may be contributed to learning a concept for the paranormal before I was able to attempt to understand the paranormal.




Further notes/thoughts:

I say earlier that I ""remember it as if it were a dream from the night before"". A complicating factor in this story is that I have counted myself fortunate to be someone who dreams in color and can even make conscious decisions while dreaming. I have often wondered if I dreamed this memory and it has somehow been lodged deeply into my psyche.

Another confusing issue is that while playing with these artifacts I can say with certain probability that I was watching one of two possible cartoons: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Ghostbusters. If I were truly watching the latter it would be extremely plausible that I imagined this to such an extent that it became real. 
An additional instance of this happening was with my maternal grandmother. I had attempted to get her scared 3 times within a day saying that a snake had crawled under the front porch. On the forth time trying to scare her I ran outside and saw the body of a black snake slithering under the porch. I swore then and I could swear now that this snake had physically existed.

I have experienced a lot though so I will only post a few stories for now.

Background: Growing up, one directly looking at the cemetery and another where you could see the backyard but the cemetery ran parallel to the backyard so you could still see a good amount of it.

The first experience that I can recall was that of a little boy. I was about six at the time and my brothers and best friend were getting ready to go outside and play. Through the window in the living room (which pointed out at the street) I saw this boy, we should ask him to play with us! I went downstairs and was outside before anyone else. He looked sad I remember so I asked him if he wanted to play. He gave a big smile and I turned around to tell everyone he was going to join and when I turned back... he was gone.

Fast forward a few years, we could see over the fence). So, the three of us were looking out into the cemetery and I noticed this black man standing over a grave. I watched him for a while until he lied down on the grass. I was confused so I told my cousin and friend what I saw. They each proceeded to tell me they didn't see what I saw but they each were seeing different people. My cousin saw an old couple holding hands over a grave and my friend saw a lady in black walking down one of the aisles... needless to say we ran into the house pretty freaked out.

One day when doing hw in the kitchen (approximately age 7/8) I was sitting alone and when i looked up a saw this man. I didn't recognize him but he was sitting in front of me with a smile. He had a glass of what I recognized to be soda. He motioned for me to continue hw so I did and when I looked again he was gone. A week later at my aunts house I see the picture of the man on her fridge. I ask my parents who that is. Turns out it was my grandfather on the dad's side. He came to the US alone when he was in his 50's to try and make money to send back to Colombia to my grandma and my aunts and uncles and my dad. He died in the states alone. 

The last event i will talk about for now is this man I have seen since I was young. In recent years I have only felt his presence from time to time but I have not seen him since I was about 13 or 14 (I am 22 now). I can remember clearly what he looks like. He was black in a white tuxedo. He had a bowtie. And a top hat. Black shoes. And a very large smile. He gave me this friend type vibe. I never was afraid of him. Simply always curious. He has never spoken to me

I have a lot more. I will tell once I feel comfortable enough...

My friends and i are deejays

There was this place in Leeuwarden where a birthday party was held.

So upon arriving on the spot we were appointed to a stage. We set up our equipment

On the left and right of that emergency door there where 2 dressing rooms.
There where no people in these rooms because we would have seen them, or behind them (so the sighting was a real sighting).

My friends and i explored the whole area

Before and during the setup and welcoming, and there are three of us.

The stage where we had to do our stuff
In the center of the back of the stage, stairs which led downstairs to a emergency door.

This emergency door was once opened by my friend and that set of an alarm.
So this door was prohibited

As deejays we prohibit people coming up to back of the stage.
There is no need for people to be over there.

Note that we don't do drugs and we do not drink.

On to the sighting: 

At a certain moment during the welcoming

I was in the left room a few minutes and i saw nobody in the room

I was standing on the stage and all of the sudden i saw someone going from the left room, his right) and walking a straight path to the left of the stage, when at the back wall he opened up a door (white door, and had a little black window on it.), and shut it.
I saw him from the beginning to the end.
(I made a horrible of the layout in Photoshop of the stage and the path the ghost guy followed, ](http://imgur.com/6mjocVf))
This door made a sound when it closed

But it was hard enough for me to hear it.

I was baffled and immediately followed him to that door but i couldn't find any door.

My friend asked me what was wrong and i explained it to him

No door was found.

Unfortunately we didn't get to ask the people who owned the place because they where gone when we could ask them.

I have experienced more stuff.

This is my first post to site such as reddit so please forgive me if i violate i violate any rules. I have tried to read the rules but i am somewhat forgetful, and for whatever reason i recalled several instances in which I have dreamt the future. Now when I say this, I don't mean anything like dreaming of the next president or world war, nothing of that sort. I mean trivial things such as dreaming of playing a game, then finding myself playing the same game, in the same exact scenario 4 years later. This game hadn't yet been created nor had I heard or seen anything about it before I had that dream. Also, apologies for making this post long but it is simply the way I write as I am a writer at heart. 

Well, as this morning progressed I increasingly grew more inclined to ask my mother if she believed in such a thing in the first place. Now, I have no idea why I asked the question I did, perhaps to simply jumpstart the conversation as I was a little embarrassed to be asking such a thing, but being a nosleep lurker I had asked her some time ago if she had any ghost stories or anything of the sort that she could tell me, that she personally believed of course, and asked her to tell me one such story now. However

 Well, my grandmother opened a shop of her own nearby their home which just so happened to be a botanica (I dont know spanish so cant translate to english). She would do tarot cards, cleansings, and healings from what my mother told me. Being Christians, it doesn't seem like she likes to get into too much detail with the occult based on the way she told me. However, in those days, my mother believed my grandmother to be helping people and thought she would help my grandmother with her work. Well, my mother has somewhat of a ""gift"" for prayers and because of this, and my mother would walk around the circle chanting the prayer. As my mother walked around the circle she would pass by the hallway with the bathroom

 She said that for whatever reason there was a somewhat sizable gap from the floor to the bottom of the door, but she assumed it to be someone from the house just listening in on them and kept on. However, as time passed she said she could see what seemed like the glow of fire from the door frame and by this time she was started to get a little spooked. It was only until smoke started spewing from the door that they thought a fire had broken out and starting calling 911 and calling for help. My mother thought of the man she saw behind the door (his boots i mean not his actual figure) and ran to the doorway trying to push it open to help whoever was inside. The doorway was locked and wouldn't budge in the slightest. She began to panic and ran outside to get help, someone must have noticed her distress because she was so frightened she couldn't speak anymore, only gesture. The man finally somewhat understood her and rushed in to help with whatever she was trying to ask for. Once they reached the doorway and started trying to bash it open, they could hear what sounded like the man on the other side rolling on the wall, perhaps trying to put the flames that enveloped him out.

 After some time, the ball of fire shot out, grazed the man that had come to help's back(he was pushing against the door and was dropped backwards to the floor when the door slammed open), bounced off the walls a bit, then shot out the open door. The firefighters had finally come, but when they went to investigate the room, nothing was actually on fire. The spots where they assumed the man to had been  rolling on the wall, and for whatever reason the toilet had exploded. The spots it had hit on the wall were also scorched, the only things that survive are the toilet and bathtub. She was going to tell me another one that was supposedly the one that brought her to Christianity and truly showed her that God is the way, I most probably missed some details as my mind isn't quite firing on all cylinders at the moment

This is how they were told to me.

At the time of the first incident, which would have put my sister at around 18.

My sister was at home with her boyfriend, leaving a small gap. It was a weekday afternoon, and I was out with some friends doing whatever it was I did after school at age 14. 

My sister and her boyfriend both hear footsteps coming up the stairs, heading towards my room which was diagonally across the hall from hers. When my sister opened the door, nobody was there. I came home about 15 minutes later. Both my sister and her boyfriend were thoroughly creeped out by the event, and I didn't hear about it until some time later. 

On to the second incident. When my husband and I first were married, and the sink was immediately to your left. 

This particular early morning my husband is up getting ready for work. I have the day off

He tells me that he'd been in the shower, and through the shower curtain (one of those see-through ones, that blurs everything but lets a lot of light through) he sees what he believes is me - a woman with long hair - stepping inside the bathroom, lean over the sink for a moment as if rinsing her hands or looking in the mirror, and stepping back out. He immediately peeked out from behind the curtain, but the door was still in the same position and did not appear to have moved. He thought that the whole thing was weird, but he didn't fully clue in that it wasn't actually me until he came back into the bedroom and found me fast asleep.

Dad had taken the jet boat out across the bay with a tobogganer. While he'd gone out my sister and I got into the water and swam out into the lake

I swam quite far and noticed the jetboat approaching. The boat plowed closer towards my sister and I.  The boat goes past.  I can see Charlene smiling at me from the toboggan, just to give me a bit of a fright.  Then, I'm underwater.  I've been tangled in the ski-rope and it has wrapped around my neck, through my mouth, dragging me deep.

This is the bit I remember most about the incident. I remember looking around up whilst underwater, how nice it was to be underwater, how beautiful everything was. Time slowed. Warmth. Peace. Love. Charlene's smile, slow motion, waving at me. The sound of water rushing in my ears. Summer. Nature. A blanket, a cocoon of bliss. 

I've never felt anything like this since - the best way to describe it could be an all-encompassing euphoric feeling of warmth and peace.  Was this 'the light' that people see when they die?  It was undeniably a life-changing event; I think of it as a defining point in my life

I don't know how long I was under - it could have been hours but was most likely under a minute.  I'd inhaled water and been knocked unconscious and given concussion. There was a point that I came to and somehow I made it to the beach, spitting out blood and teeth and sand to find a large tear in my cheek. Surprisingly I didn't feel any pain at all. I was rushed to hospital and received stitches, and for several years after needed orthodontic work.  My sister escaped the incident unscathed.

Anyway... I'm older and wiser now.  In my younger years I'd been convinced what happened was some sort of spiritual encounter, as happens to people on drugs or on their deathbeds. Still, I'm no scientist. It could have been something else.

I started feeling like someone was watching me, the bed takes up most of the room) and I couldn't find the things after searching it several times over, I'm pretty sure that it was the ghost grabbing things. They were always important things or items that held sentimental value: my high school transcript, my pearl necklace, some barrettes that I had never even taken out of my jewelry box. I'd also hear footsteps above me, which I thought were mice or something since there isn't an attic above me, but they were definitely too heavy to be anything but human (any animal heavy enough to make footsteps like this probably wouldn't be able to get up on the roof.) This was when I started to really get scared.

About four or five months after moving in, and I) started doing a lot of spring cleaning. My step-mom ended up finding little hidey-holes around the house while we were cleaning (she and my dad had just moved into the house about two years prior to me moving in with them) and there were a few trinkets in the hidey-holes. We found marbles, toy trucks, toy soldiers, and, creepiest of all, in my opinion, but after finding that stuff I had wondered if maybe it was the ghost taking and hiding things.

Fast forward another month, but no, my laptop was shut off. I noticed that the light was emanating from above my door, around where the ceiling connects to the wall. I then thought that maybe it was the windows letting light in, but even if there had been light coming from outside (there wasn't), there was no way that the light could have reflected up to that specific spot. It scared me a lot so I ended up turning on the ceiling light and reading instead of going back to bed.

More detail on the light: it wasn't really an orb

Later that same month, and he looked at me a little bewildered and said, ""Didn't I tell you there was a ghost in the house?""

When I told him that, he went on to tell me all about his experiences with the ghost. Apparently was already in the house when he and my step-mom moved in, and they're both very easygoing, kind people and didn't take offense to it. He told me that he talks to it sometimes, just says things like, ""I know you're here. I hope everything is going well,"" and friendly things like that.

He told me that really the only time he's felt afraid of the ghost was when he and my step-mom got into a huge two or three week long argument and the ghost started banging cupboards and stealing things. He said that he thought it was probably the high emotions and raised voices that set the ghost off.

Another time he saw the ghost was when going into the bathroom late at night. He opened the bathroom door and saw the silhouette of a man in the room, thinking it might have just been his eyes, but the air was definitely colder than the rest of the room. He flipped on the switch and nothing was there.

The thing that stuck out to me the most was him mentioning that he and my step-mom had been arguing in their bedroom late one night and suddenly my step-mom had stopped and pointed up at the doorway and there was a light emanating from where the ceiling and wall met right above the door. This gave me definite chills, I'd gotten into an argument with my girlfriend the same night that I saw the light over my bedroom door, which makes me wonder if it was the heated emotions that brought it on for both of our experiences.

Recently I haven't heard or felt anything from the ghost. I ended up having to shove a desk into the tiny corner where I usually felt its presence (due to my room being so small, or if that might be unique to our household ghost.",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,

Way back when I was in Jr.High school, it seemed like everyone in the world knew who he was. So many people showed up to his funeral that they couldn't fit everyone in the church. I don't have a ton of memories of him but I do miss him.

Years have passed now and we have moved on with our lives, he was convinced someone was in the room. He started saying that they needed to go see Bruce. That he wanted to see my Uncle (his son). My grandma explained that he had passed away several years ago. My grandpa got rather confused then and said ""No, Bruce is right there!"" and he pointed to the corner he seemed to keep trying to go towards.  With my grandpas illness I'm sure he barely remembers the experience. When I was told this story, it sent shivers down my spine. The more i thought about it though, the more comforted i felt with the idea that even in death, my uncle is still that great man, watching over the ones he loves.

My Grandma has stated that she has occasionally felt ""something"" in the place but never has been able to put her finger on it.

First, had our scary experiences in the upstairs guest bedroom, many of the arrowhead cases were hanging on the wall of that bedroom.  When I returned to this house with my wife to temporarily stay here before we move again, I made sure to remove them from the walls and store them in the basement.  They are very heavy, and I was paranoid to sleep in the room with them for fear that they would fall off the wall one night and land on our heads.  It has definitely crossed my mind that a collection of so many items that have a history of their own and that originally did not belong to my family may not be good mojo for the house.  But, as I relayed in my first post, I am generally the skeptic of the family, it is not really my choice to make-- my mom is owner of the house

The second thing I forgot to mention is the ""handprint, and there was this pool of blood that was shaped like a handprint of sorts, except it had six ""fingers.""  I remember being surprised that so much blood could have been pooled under the package and surprised that the plastic on the bottom of the package could have channeled the blood into exactly that shape.  I thought it was spooky, but being a skeptic and knowing the immediate origin of the print, I never thought much more about it.  I took a digital picture of it before I cleaned it up, and sent it to my sister to show her the cool, spooky thing I had found.

The first 2 years I lived there, happy, and healthy. But around the middle of the third year, things started to get weird.
I think it's worth mentioning that around this time

Anyway

(I think before I start I should mention that when we moved in

I believe the first things that started happening were constant nightmares. Some of the most disturbing, this could just be because I was having massive hormone changes due to early puberty. 

The next thing that started happening terrified me so much that I rarely slept in my bedroom. 
I started hearing strange noises at night. The feeling I got from these noises was strange- it was almost like how in a dream, I had an intense amount of fear and anxiety that would almost make my fight-or-flight instincts kick in. 
It was always so strange how I would be so afraid of these noises
It was a different noise every night. A couple nights I remember hearing this strange series of ""beeps"", but right after it stopped I heard very faint, brief, sinister laughing. It sounded like a man.
Another night I heard another very faint

That's all I can remember for the noises.

After the noises starting coming more often, I suddenly felt the air get heavy and I felt like someone was behind me. I tried to ignore it... but then all of a sudden, I felt something push on my back so hard I almost fell out of my bed. It seriously scared me. 
One night, I was at risk for epilepsy and still am, and I had a seizure once as a baby) 
While I was trying to fall asleep, but I swear it looked like the thing was breathing. Its chest was moving up and down. Again, I ran out of my room to sleep in my parents' room.


Occasionally, on the dot, every night for a couple months. It didn't matter what time she went to bed, it was always 3am.

Almost all of the strange things that happened were in my room
One of the only things I can think of that happened outside my room was my great grandmother's large, very long time. It was collecting dust. 
One night

Well, out of curiosity and anxiety, I decided to take a sound sample of my room when it was quiet. I do remember hearing something when I amplified the sound, but that could just be interference of some kind.

Whenever I was in my bedroom, I feel like it certainly didn't want me there. Even my cats rarely went into my room.

I just think it's very strange that only I ever experienced this sort of stuff and no one else. It's weird that I felt a horrible feeling in my room but no one else did. And this continued until the shortly before the year we moved out. After that, no fear. We had lived there for almost 6 years. Ever since then, I haven't had this experience.

I think it might be good to mention that there was an intense amount of stress in the house. My parents were fighting almost constantly and it got extremely bad. They never hit each other, and verbally abusive. We had to deal with the deaths in my mom's family, being extremely poor, having to constantly treat my mom's illnesses (which have vanished since we moved out), and my constant anxiety over everything happening. When we ""moved out"", we were actually kicked out by my mom's at-the-time husband and he asked for a divorce, over the phone

I have had several experiences throughout my 24 years here on earth that only furthered my belief. None of these experiences I am about to tell are particularly scary

This is my first time writing about any of my experiences

The first experience I remember is a pretty hazy one, or if it was just a dream. I maintain that it actually happened. It is also the only experience that I have never spoken of before now.

When I was about 4 or 5, and seemed the perfect size for my sister and I. My bed was closest to this door, something I was never comfortable with but didn't have an explanation for my discomfort at the time. I always felt most comfortable if I was laying in bed facing the door, afraid that something or someone would come through it without me seeing it. 

One night I awoke, opening it slowly as to not make a lot of noise and wake my sister. The barn was eerily quiet, and I could see a strange white glow coming from the ground floor in the center of the barn. I crept slowly toward the edge of the balcony until I could see what was causing the light and, looking back now, was surprisingly unphased by what I saw. 

Standing in the middle of the barn was a figure, yet solid at the same time. The figure was just standing with their arms raised above their head, facing the ceiling of the barn with their eyes closed. Almost as soon as I saw the figure, I felt compelled to go back to bed. Without reacting to what I was seeing at all, I slowly backed my way back into my bedroom. As soon as I shut the door the fear hit me and I made a running leap into my bed and hid myself under the blankets. It took me a bit to fall back to sleep, bit eventually I did, making sure I didn't turn my back to the door.

I never told my parents about what I saw, however. I also never had any other experience of that nature in that house.

Most of my other experiences occurred later in life, but none of the houses either parent moved to seemed to have any paranormal activity. 

My mom remarried when I was 8 and we moved into a house in Vermont

 It was in that house where I would have several more experiences. Here they are

First, somewhat somber energy that was definitely female. The house is known as the Winn House, built in 1825, and I believe the female ghost is that of Mary Winn, whom the house is named for. The other energy was somewhat darker, not bad but not very good either, and it was definitely male. Maybe Mary Winn's husband, swapping their locations)

My sister and I initially shared one of the two bedrooms upstairs, needing more privacy as I was getting older and coming into puberty, and couldn't stand my sister at times. 

It was in this room where I started experiencing thing I could not explain. It was usually small things, only to appear exactly where I had left them. It unnerved me, but I never felt threatened by any of it, so I just shook it off. As I grew older, the more I opened myself to it, the more I experienced. 

I am still unsure if the energy in my bedroom was that of one of the two ghosts downstairs, where I went to school. I could always feel a familiar presence, but never experienced what I had at home. I always played it off and spoke of it as my imaginary friend whom I had dubbed 'Francis'. It seemed fitting for some reason. 

When I was in high school, and my sister was upstairs asleep as well. 

When you walk through the front door, and to the right is the livingroom.

I shut the front door quietly behind me, I heard a loud whisper from the livingroom. I was extremely creeped out- one, because no one in the house was awake *or* in the livingroom, and two, because of what the whisperer said. My name. It was a quick ""Leah!"" Without responding to it at all, I ran upstairs to my room and got ready for bed as fast as I could.

Another experience I had was when I was sitting in the livingroom watching a baseball game one summer night. My parents had gone to bed and my sister was upstairs in her room reading. All of a sudden, and then dissipated as quickly as it had come about. 

(A quick side note, and one for the stereo, both of which lay on the coffee table a few feet in front of me.)

When the game was over, TV, cable box, and stereo, shut off simultaneously. This undoubtedly freaked me out, so I quickly turned around and turned off the lamp that was behind me and went upstairs. 

The next day I told my mom about what had happened, and it was exactly as I had described it to her. She also had a few isolated experiences in that house, and she and I were the only ones to ever experience anything. 

I always felt like there was someone in the livingroom with me, other times it was as if someone was sitting on whatever couch I wasn't on (we had two). In the instances when I felt them on the opposite couch, it was a very relaxed feeling, like they were just joining me in my television watching. 

The weirdest experience I had was during my junior year of high school. I was up in my room watching Law&amp;Order:SVU on my tiny 13"" television. I was seated on the foot of my bed, and the tv remote was next to the lamp. My sister was already asleep in her room across the hall.

I *BLINKED*, laying on my back (which is something I never do because I can't sleep in that position), my window was closed, the light and tv were shut off, and the remote, as I found later, was across the room under my desk. And it was *4 hours later*. It scared the shit out of me. I didn't know what to do, so I just forced myself to fall asleep. 

To this day I cannot explain what happened. I asked my mom if maybe she had come upstairs and did anything, let alone that night. I don't really think it had anything to do with ghosts, and aliens were my next best guess. I have no idea. 

A couple years ago, we both turned toward the livingroom window, where we saw a face looking back at us. It was an old woman who stood just in front of the window, leaning toward it as she watched us. When she saw us look at her, she backed away from the window and disappeared. My ex and I just looked at each other, not needing to say anything to know that we had both just seen the same thing.

A couple years later (this past year in fact), but only when my boyfriend wasn't home (he has a strong energy himself and I feel like it repelled the ghost). When I sat on the couch in the livingroom that was against the front wall, I could see into the diningroom, and usually felt someone standing in the diningroom looking into the livingroom. I usually made it a habit to not sit on that couch because the constant feeling of being watched unnerved me slightly. I also was uncomfortable walking through the diningroom when the lights were off, always unnecessarily rushing through it if I was home alone.

Despite all the experiences I had in that house, but I could feel them constantly. 

One day a friend of ours was over, from the sexes of the spirits to the locations of high activity. I told him of my experiences and he didn't seem surprised in the least. 

The creepiest part about our conversation was when he stopped mid-sentence, and it was most likely because they could sense that I was the most open to the idea of them. 

We moved out of that house a couple months ago

I was in middle school and my mom had recently passed away. It was morning

I was in my PJ's and brushing my hair with a round black brush that had a purple and teal handle. I walked from the kitchen to the front door so that I could step outside for a second to check the temperature so I could pick out the best clothes to wear.

On the way to the door

I came back inside and I found the brush on the floor...on the other side of the room. No less than 14 or 15 feet away. It was as if someone had picked it up &amp; tossed it at the far wall. Not a single person was home (beside me)

1337318919.0,tsvvc,I don't know how to feel about my sense,idontfeelverywell,21,6,12,"This is my first time posting and I'm not sure if I will again. Hence

Let me start from what I believe is the beginning. I was 15 at the time and hanging out with some friends at the playground in our neighborhood. We lived in an upper/middle-class county

The neighborhood we lived in had nature trails that began next to the playground and snaked every which way with exits occasionally at subdivisions. One night

This is not the basis of my story. This story shorter, one of the opposing team could be standing just off the trail and watch me go by. But, I knew the guys that were playing wouldn't see that as fun or fair, especially in our group. I had just given up searching down a particular trail and was heading back when the air fell unnaturally silent. I stopped and listened hard, kneeling as slowly as I could. 

This is when it happened. A small ringing began in my ears. I'm not sure if this happens to anybody else, it didn't work that way. I focused, expecting the ringing to get louder, then I'd get a small headache which would subside a few moments later. I felt it was small annoyance, seeing as I was listening for someone moving. But the small ringing continued. I listened to it for a minute or two, waiting for it to subside when suddenly I saw a bright white light.

I was on the ground, not moving. One of them had gone for help, while the others stayed with me. I was shocked, trying to shake it off as nothing in front of the guys, but I was ice-cold and drenched in sweat.

I have not been the same since that night. 

It began small in the weeks following. I would be out somewhere and I would have to stop because I would..feel something. I can only define it as a lurch of my stomach and followed by a feeling. Defining the feeling as an ""emotion"" would be too simple. I would feel...a moment of time. A moment of time that was not the one I was in.

For example

One day

I got up, so I figured I would wait in the bay for him. But on the way to the door, I slowed. My stomach lurched up and I felt dread. True, undeniable dread. I could feel the color drain from my face and I had to grab at the counter next to me. At this moment I felt something. I could feel a man. He was uncertain, but determined. I smelt..rust? Exhaust. I stumbled into the microwave on the counter and nearly fell to the floor. My mother managed to catch me in time and pulled me upright. She was asking me what was wrong, but I could barely hear her. I felt a rising,  then let out a sudden uncontrollable scream. And as abruptly as I began

My father and his crew came in a few moments later. My mother explained what had happened and my father immediately checked me. He couldn't find anything wrong with me. As they watched me in the chair I could hear them talking. The call my father had just returned from was a man that had jumped in front of the inbound Marta train coming in to the city. The police and a crowd that had gathered had tried to call him back from the tracks. He had seemed hesitant

I am 22 now and I have had hundreds of moments like this. Each time I have tried to track the feelings to a source event, but it is the best I could do.

I am interested in what all of you think of this and hope that you are not quick to judge me. I will try to answer any questions you have.

I go outside at night for a cigarette and like looking at the stars. So I start watching some ufos, they were covering my vision, so I had to look at the sky to really see the details, which were AMAZINGLY detailed. 

They are pulsating images, if you look up telepathy, it will tell you that what I just described is exactly what happens (i looked it up afterward and nearly shit myself). So I get these weird images, about 5 in all the first time, over a course of about 10 minutes. I would get around 1 minute per image, about a pulse every 5 seconds. 

So after this happened once, maybe humans. It started off as ape looking creatures, moved on to how we look today, than kept going farther and slightly resembled a type of alien. I only got faces, and it sort of looked like grey aliens facial features, but not giant egg shaped heads. It was weird. I know this sounds retarded and that I'm making it up, but I swear to you fine people that I'm not. Theres no reason for me to make this up

Ok enough of the pics, then I start to get the pulses. 

So I concentrate and am getting this beautifully detailed image of looks like a large explosion. I could not for the life of me figure out what it was, it was like a real time perfect view of a nuke. Mushroom cloud and everything. So I couldnt figure it out and went back inside and back on reddit. I reload the front page (this was at like 3 am btw) and what do I see?

In the 60’s, so she was not put off by the condition of the house.

The story about the house seems very “urban legend” and a little cliché to me

Apparently, Nettie, fell in love with a ranch hand. The father found out, Nettie and her sister-in-law were sent on a trip to Europe, Nettie comes home to find the ranch hand gone, later finds out ranch had was murdered by father, locks herself in her room and dies of a broken heart. In typical ghost story form, within a year her father was trampled by one of his prize-winning race horses

My mom claims to have a lot of experiences in the house. Every day at exactly noon the pantry door would open. She would even try to put heavy objects in front of it

One of the stories involved my step-sister who had strep throat. Apparently, heard a woman with swishing skirts and high heels put a cold hand on her forehead and say, “You can get up in a few minutes, you are fine now.” My step-sister gets up in a few minutes, goes downstairs, the doctor is still there, and checks her out. She was completely well. My step-sister thought it was my mom who had told her that

The best story of the house is that Nettie’s room was apparently locked and no one had the key. One morning, no dust bunnies, it was perfect.

I was admitted to hospital years ago with a chest infection. I'm a frequent visitor. Hospitals are basically my second home and I find them relaxing

During this stay, but not this time. I was probably the only one in the room under the age of 60. I don't believe anyone else was there for respiratory issues, even though it was a respiratory ward.

So I carry out my hospital routine. Read books

I wake up a couple times during the night, so I go back to sleep.

I wake up again as the nurse turns on the light across from me and I see a few people enter the room in casual dress, maybe I did the same again. I'm disoriented and check my phone, it's around 4:00 in the morning.

Then this woman starts crying hysterically. Wailing loudly in a foreign language. She must have been his daughter

The next few hours are spent with an assortment of family and friends coming to say their final goodbyes before he's taken away to what I can only imagine is the hospital's morgue. Except

I ate breakfast only a few metres from this now deceased man. Then I ate lunch. It was sort of off-putting but I wasn't disgusted or creeped out. I just accepted the fact that it was his time. I don't know why it took the hospital staff as long as it did. I saw them wheel his body out in a bag. I didn't feel anything. Just curious I guess.

1332771731.0,re7qp,Multiple Occurences I've been witness to (ME + FAM),NinjahNizz,18,3,4,"Originally posted this on an Askreddit thread but it got buried quite heavily so going to repost both my sets of personal stories here.

The first story happened one night after a night on the town, my only thought being, hey, at least I get a lie in tomorrow. So fast forward a few hours, it was about 5am, the sun just starting to come up, and I'm woken from my slumber by what can only be described as a high pitched ringing noise, it was Sunday

A few more minutes passed without it stopping and I start to realise the sound is coming from much closer by, it's coming from the cabinet under my bed. So I get down off the bed, and look around underneath. Under there is where all my old toys from when I was young are kept, mostly so when my niece and nephew get old enough they can have them. But I could hear the ringing much more clearly now, so I drag the box from the furthest back out of the cabinet and rummage through to near enough the bottom, and there it is, an old watch that I used to wear when I was around 7, literally none of the buttons did anything

Now at this point, and with a splash heard it hit a puddle. Pulling the window closed though, I could still hear it ringing before it shut. Strange enough, a dead battery and flooded with water and it's somehow still alive. But I went back to bed.
The next morning (I was 19 at the time, so I explain. So she wanders into the kitchen and brings back the watch. It's still ringing. Dead battery, outside in the rain all night, and thrown off the second floor of my house. I still can't explain how, or why after so long it had suddenly done what it did.

Second story, the microwave goes crazy periodically for example. We didn't think much of it, except there were two things that happened that gave us the chills. The first, one day my mum woke up to find my old yellow Gameboy brick and my Gameboy colour (neither of which i use anymore) out of the cabinet drawer where they usually are and up on the side. A few questions later, we find that not a single one of us had moved them. Still unexplained. The other occured in two parts. My niece (Age 3) ran down to our living room at the front of the house, the light in there was off at the time, and a few moments later we hear a scream, we check

Move forward a few months, but a blink later it's gone. Steeling myself, I walk in there, to find one of the curtain ties swinging back and forth, never getting any lower or slowing. I stood transfixed for a few minutes, 'til it suddenly went limp, as if someone had been sat by it swinging it and decided to stop. The kicker? The house owner before us was a strange, and used to insist on sleeping in that very room. None of us know why

Next story, and nor had they gone through the gate at the end. Now just to clarify something, if you were to stand directly behind the gate and reach through the wall into the house, the first thing you'd come into contact with is the wireless printer directly next to the wall, sat on a desk. I was told that after this figure had walked down the entry, the sound of footsteps suddenly stopped behind the gate (they're very clear when you're in the house, it echoes a little so you always know if someone walks down), the printer

One more, as she said a strange man kept coming into her room and watching her, walking around her bed. Strange enough, but could be put down to night terrors and bad dreams. So finally the day comes when he and my sister decide to move out of that house for pastures new, I go along to help them pack up some of their stuff, along with my mum and other sister. What we find when we enter the house is a strong smell of cigarette smoke (neither he nor my sister smoked). 

As if this wasn't odd enough, this stuff had not been there when my sister and her boyfriend had left. Just a couple of cushions, one of the wooden snakes from their fireplace, a wash basket, underwear, shirts, a kitchen pan and even a DVD had somehow found it's way into a pile in this bath tub. Needless to say we hurried the hell up with packing and got out of there.

1331813490.0,qxo8a,"[FAM] ""You look like you've seen a ghost!""",London-Lass,16,2,4,"My mum is now retired but used to work as a housekeeper to a (wealthy) family in St John's Wood.  She was appointed by the family to work for them in Essex and

The house the family moved into in St John's Wood was a relatively old (and rather grand) townhouse on lower ground, it was during these works, that odd things began to happen.

I remember my mum chatting to me one evening about the house’s alarm.  Whilst the family were holidaying abroad the alarm had gone off in the evening on a couple of occasions (long after my mum had left the premises).  One son had remained in the UK (he had his own place) and, they arranged for a representative from the alarm company to visit the house to check out the alarm and, during his visit, my mum ran through her routine of setting the alarm which was correct.  In addition, the alarm company representative could not find anything at fault with the system and, on being asked what else might have caused it to activate, did mention that a marked change in temperature *might* be a possible trigger.  

Another time my mum said that both her and the lady of the house were in the ground floor study.  The study housed shelves of books which my mum and the lady of the house were going through, plugged into the wall, that my mum had left just before commencing the book dusting.  Whilst getting on with their task my mum and the lady of the house were making small talk (with their backs to each other) and, during their chit-chat, my mum remembers suddenly hearing the vacuum cleaner start up.  Thinking the lady of the house had come down from her ladder to commence vacuuming she carried on book dusting, only to hear the lady of the house suddenly call over to her, whilst still up her ladder!  My mum said that they both looked down at the vacuum cleaner whirring away on the floor between them unable to figure out how it had switched itself on.

On the second floor of the house lay the guest rooms.  These were rarely used but were cleaned regularly with bedding changed and washed on a fortnightly basis.  Each guest room had been decorated in different colours - peach, whilst working, she would often switch on the kitchen radio to keep her company.  On a few occasions, after finishing her work and switching off the radio, my mum would realise that she could still hear music (but very distantly) in the house.  Each time it was discovered that the music was coming from a bedside radio up on the second floor in the blue guest room.  

In addition, and left a selection of towels on the end of the guest room bed ready for his arrival.  The son wasn’t due to arrive until the evening (a few hours after my mum had left) and the following morning my mum was approached by the lady of the house who asked if anything had happened the previous day.  My mum was puzzled and couldn’t think of anything unusual to report.  The lady of the house apologised for the unusual questioning, but said that the whole thing seemed very odd given the usual high quality of my mum’s work.  She then went on to say that on arriving at the house at night, the son had opened up the door to the blue guest room to find the room in stuffy darkness (curtains drawn, windows shut) with the radio set blaring away.  After switching off the radio and turning on the light, he found just a small hand towel on the bed.  It was only by hunting through the room’s cupboards was he able to locate the rest of the towels that should have been provided.  My mum was totally shocked by this and unable to offer an explanation, other than (as she always had) she had left the room with plenty of towels

A little while after this my mum was (again) working alone in the house.  The kitchen required a thorough going over and she was determined to get the floor cleaned and dried before the lady of the house returned.  Switching on the kitchen radio, she was just about to get up and out of the lady in the house’s way, when she realised, on glancing up, that there was a man standing in the doorway.  Startled by his appearance, my mum began to say something, but as quickly as mum had spotted him in the doorway, my mum said that he didn’t dissolve into an ethereal mist, although she only got a brief glimpse of him

Reaching for one of the kitchen chairs, the house’s doorbell went (making my mum jump out of her skin).  On shakily opening up the front door, my mum was met with the family’s gardener, who after wishing my mum a cautious good morning, told her it looked like she’d seen a ghost!

1324287363.0,nicgi,Haunting in Savannah [me],Melawian,17,0,7,"Every place I live is filled with ghosts. Savannah was no exception. For a year a half I lived in a big old house that had been renovated to be four apartments.  The house had originally been built by a woman whose family had lived on a plantation outside of Savannah.  She had wanted to live closer to town


It was a really neat house. Absolutely huge with a fire place in every room.  The part of the house I lived in was a two room studio which had probably been her library or bedroom.   I could see the back of Mrs. Wilkes restuarant and the courtyard that was in the back.  There was a huge tree that had obviously been planted in the back when the house had been built.  The tree had grown up all around the house and the branches were all around my windows giving it the feel of a tree house.

From the first though, I went into a sort of trance like state that could best be described as a sort of other dimension. Everything was black and white.  The lighting was almost as if a strobe light was going off and on.  As a lay there, the lady of the house came up to me and told me that I had better keep her house clean.  She had a full almost hoop skirt and bun.  There was a little black child clinging to her skirt, and I think an older black man that looked like a butler standing in the background.  The room was the same except for the furnishings which were certainly more of the Victorian Era. 

I woke up, though--trips to other dimensions kind of take it out of you.  

Well, and change the channels on the tv and the like.  I kept the house clean because she told me to.

A couple of weeks before Christmas, I was a bit shocked, but it didnt really bug me, other than I wanted to listen to Jane's Addiction, and she had no right to tell me otherwise--so i turned it up louder. She turned off the stereo and knocked the front off the speakers off again.  Now I was really mad--I dont let ghosts push me around much--so I took the front of the speakers and nailed them onto the speaker itself--and turned the stereo up. I was satisfied with myself and challenged her to make the front of the speakers fall of again.

Well, I couldnt find any of them.  They had vanished.  Completely gone.

I took this as a sign and turned off the stereo and decided to go out for awhile.  When I got home, laying in the middle of the floor was a pendant. I wasnt very big and it said ""Liberty, Maternity, and Fraternity,"" in old timey letters that were stamped on it.  It was weird and kind of had the look of when I went into that other dimension.  I thought it was really cool, though. I wore it for awhile, but I dont know if I lost it or she took it back,,False,t3_nicgi

As a child I had imaginary friends, at some point in their toddler years, talking to nothing, just an imaginary friend..I thought. Before either of them were born I would have sleep overs with my friends, and despite not talking to any of them about my suspicions, it was inevitable that one of my guests would have a run in with one of the two ""known"" entities that share my home.

When my first sister was born I would wake up and see a female shape in my door swaying slightly back and forth, on more than one occasion, turned around in the attic to see a man behind her..just watching. While this would be incredibly unnerving to almost anyone, his presence was never intimidating. I came to learn that my third-Great Grandfather was a Union solder, and was discharged in my home town. We have a charcoal portrait of him in the study. If you ask either my mother or myself, we think it's him. 

As I got into my teen years of course I would stay up late, but with my door still shut tight from my secret conversation sessions. One night I was awakened by someone touching my hand. They weren't so much grabbing/holding on but lightly tracing their fingertips down my fingers and palm. Of course, no one was ever there. I began to cocoon myself up tightly in my comforters to avoid these occurrences. Hovering in the hallway is one thing, touching me while I sleep is another. Not soon after I switched rooms so that my younger sisters could share and I could have a considerably smaller, but still private, room at the end of the hall, next to the bathroom. I still heard footsteps
""What are you doing? Where did you go??"" 
'I was asleep! My bad..shit..I'm coming
""Oh..I thought I saw you in the kitchen(we have large bay windows).. you were almost to the door then turned and bolted back to the living room..I thought you forgot something but then you didn't come back.""
""Must've been my mom.. I'll be right down.""

As I headed downstairs I passed my parent's room and saw my mother still in bed sleeping. I hadn't had an experience in a few years at this point and was a little surprised ""She"" was back. My neighbor didn't know anything about this history as she had just moved in a year or so before. I never told her who she saw. 

Six or so months later I met a guy while bar tending for a major restaurant chain. He came in for quite a while before I agreed to see him outside of work, I didn't want to sound like a crazy bitch. I reluctantly went along with the conversation, trying to figure out where he was going with this as it wasn't any time near Halloween. He told me that he was home alone, just tidying up, etc. and got the feeling he was being watched, as he looked across the room he caught a flash-glimpse of a woman in a white dress. I really didn't know what to say, think or feel. He asked if I had any similar occurrences as this had never happened to him and he had a relatively new house. He thought maybe it was something attached to me that decided to stay back and check him out. We didn't see each other much after that

The only person I can think of that would attach themselves to me and follow me (Whereas I feel Mathias, and was a nurse -- hence the white dress. I wear an engagement ring of hers on my right hand and hardly EVER take it off (only for clinical really..I'm a nursing student atm). When I was born she was living with my grand parents. When I would visit I would stay in what was her room. One time, and only once, I was in the room watching TV and playing and heard my name clearer than anything called out from what seemed like under the bed which I was sitting on. I was only five or six at the time and immediately hopped up, jumped as far as I could off of the bed, and RAN for my grandmother in the living room. There are so many coincidences that I'm almost convinced. 

I moved out of my parents house at the age of nineteen. Since then I haven't had any unexplainable happenings..until this week. The house I live in now, as far as we're aware of at least. I get uneasy feelings from time to time, but always brush it off as irrational paranoia from too much time on Nosleep. You know how it is..a stray, cool breeze will brush your hair/neck, the house will creak or there will be a tapping..it could be anything.. Two nights ago I was lying in bed waiting for my boyfriend to return from a quick store trip (If you're familiar with Wawa, there's three within five miles of the house). I was home alone. Light play on the half opened bedroom door caught my attention and I saw a medium height shadow pass by, heading towards the stairs. Again, no street lights shine in to any of the windows on that side of the house..

1320848110.0,m634c,[Me] At my sister's funeral,littlegoth,25,11,10,"When I was a teenager, but the most memorable thing happened at my ""sister's"" funeral.

I should preface this with the fact that she wasn't my blood relation, when another sister (of similar circumstances) appeared at our house early one morning our family reacted the way any family would.  We packed everything and got on the road within hours.

Upon arriving at my uncle's house, and despite my mood the room was bright and cheerful.  Nicole climbed up, gathered Nancy's jingle dress and told me to stay out of the way, it was only the first of the four day funeral and I wasn't going to help with the washing of the body because I was too young.
Then my uncle came and called me down.  He handed me a phone and told me to sit in Nancy's room
It was one of those [streamlined home phones](http://www.thephoneresource.com/images/210_lg.jpg), and at most was only about 3 feet tall and somewhere between 2 and 2.5 feet wide, it was like one of those cute doors that you usually see under staircases.

I took the phone with a nod and climbed back up the staircase, or to impart the bit I had been given.  

Once I was about 3 feet from the door with my back to it, but the kicker was that I heard the phone falling down the steps to the floor.  That unique sound of an encased bell being knocked around and plastic impacting on hard surfaces.

I sighed and scooted back to the door

Once again when I made it a few feet away from the door, and the phone banged down to the concrete garage floor below.  My head whipped to the sound and I moved back, this time pausing before the doorway to listen if someone was pulling this prank on me.  Listening for any sound in the house, or on the stairs.  There was nothing, and when I pushed the door open, the same sight met me.  Everything was as I left it.

I was more confused than scared, I also pushed at the phone, trying to nudge it out of place.  Finally, I bounced on the sliver of floor between the steps and the doorway.  The phone was secure.  Not taking any chances with the door, I found the small bit of twine that Nancy used to hold the door open and attached it to the inside doorknob.  I pulled and pushed at the door before being confident that the strange behavior would stop.  I called out into the house below that I was upstairs and if they needed me to come get me and turn turned around and crawled back into the room.  This time however, my destination had changed.  I moved in and turned once in the doorway, going to look at something on a shelf on the opposite side I had originally intended on going.

I pulled myself to my feet and after a few steps, the small rope was once again attached to the inside knob like I had left it.

At this point I was a little scared, grabbing the phone as I went and walked the entire house, calling for anyone who was there to come out.  After searching and being convinced I was alone, I climbed the steps and replaced the phone, giving the door a quick and careful tug as I passed it and moved toward the stereo again.

My nightmares never involve being chased by things. On the contrary

As a child, only that he would stalk around the walls of the house, trying to find a way in, staring through any windows without the curtains pulled. I spent my pre-teen years in an urban area without much in the way of wildlife. We moved to get closer to the high school I would be attending, into an area next to the forest. 

Those of us who have heard it in the night, staying up far too late into the early hours of the morning, in the study with the window that backs onto our large, wooded garden.

So imagine a teenage me, and with the acoustics of the street I can follow their movements. It's late summer and I'm restless, it's too hot and their squeals are echoing incessantly. 

I hear the squawking of one particular fox, I can see it turn the corner into our cul-de-sac. I hear it approach the house, down our driveway. This isn't too unusual; they like our garden and they can access plenty of other places from under the fence. But this fox doesn't follow the path I expect. The barking gets louder and louder, coming almost directly below me, until... bam!

I hear the sound of the front door rattling in its hinges from a heavy blow. I bolt upright

The bizarre yelping then recedes into the night and I lay back down

I shrugged the incident off at first. But then, sometimes the back, sometimes the front. Nothing ever came of it, and it never happened again after that winter. 

And so, and I still wonder what on earth was happening. Why would a fox try to enter a house? I wouldn't have thought one would be capable of the thought processes necessary. My house at university was broken into a while back, through an undamaged back door (swinging uselessly open, with the lock still set in the closed position, I had to 'unlock' it to close it again) by an unseen antagonist who fled as soon as I stumbled out of my room. This incident got me thinking about the past, and I remembered those events which may otherwise have entirely disappeared from my memory.

It was late at night.  Ordinarily, 240) like me.  This night, though, I found myself out visiting a friend I had made who had fallen ill and was bed-ridden.  It was almost eleven by the time I realized the hour, and so I bid a hasty farewell and started on the long trek across the city back to the house at which I was staying.  

During the daylight hours, which would likely make it a forty-five minute trip.  Figuring I wanted to get home as quickly as possible, I struck out at a fairly quick pace.

As I walked along the deserted dirt roads, it would often get chilly at night even during the summer, but here we were in October and it was downright cold, and it seemed to be getting colder. I shivered against the cold and picked up my pace even more.  

I got to a cross street that would lead me almost straight back to my house and turned the corner where I suddenly encountered a wall of fog.  It was incredibly surreal.  One minute on one street there was no fog, I took a deep breath and walked into the shroud of fog.

Inside the fog it was obviously colder.  I began shivering almost uncontrollably as I penetrated deeper and deeper.  After about five minutes

I waited a moment, but something else.  It sounded as if something were being dragged.  It was a light constant crunch against the stone and dirt that made up the road. I walked faster hoping that I could simply outpace whatever it was behind.  Still, I could hear it coming on.  It got no farther away and it got no closer.  Still, I couldn't see anything for the fog.

After a few minutes that felt like an eternity, sprinting faster than I ever had before or have since.  Still the fog was with me, and still the crunching continued.  I raced down the street. I looked behind me and the thick fog continued to stretch down the street, the crunching still back there.  As I sprinted past the next street, the fog suddenly ended.  The world seemed flood with light as the streetlights above me glowed down onto me.

I skidded around a corner and stopped.  I was breathing hard, but there was no sound except the rasping of breathing in the thin mountain air. I glanced around the corner to see if anything was there and was shocked by what I found.  There was absolutely no fog anywhere to be found.

We're Indian and my grandparents live with us, and our whole family had a pretty great time. My great-aunt was among those laughing and dancing with the kids and enjoying herself.

Then, and then Tuesday night she passed away with filled lungs. The funeral was set to go on Thursday morning. I was in high school at the time and my parents were on later schedules, so I told my family I'd wake them up when I left for school.

Thursday morning, though there was no sudden pang of fear or panic.

I saw my great-aunt walk up towards the bathroom door, SIMULTANEOUSLY. Then, I walked out of the bathroom and saw a faint cloud dissipate in the beams of sunlight shining through the windows of the living room.

She looked to be checking up on us, and though it was sudden, I knew that she lived well and was thankful that she didn't really suffer. I was amazed that out of anyone in my family, I was the only one who had seen her. At number family engagements since, I've asked around and no one had any similar experience.

It's sort of interesting, but they're kind of a special case, at least if they linger for very long. Since no one has had any experience of her since the funeral, I think it's safe to assume she moved on, but it was cool to catch that glimpse of her between dying and departing.

We ended up going to spend some time in my mother's family's village, rest areas, and towns with nice restaurants. It was definitely fun, though, seeing some wilder forests and old bridges on our way out there. I had a good time with my cousins and my mom's cousins, so I decided to stay a little longer after my parents and brother went back into the city.

Nights went by and we shared stories. We talked about how life was different across the world and the topic eventually came around to the supernatural. Rural India has a lot of interesting different kinds of ghosts and ghouls. Vetaals are sort of between zombies and vampires

My mom's cousin started to talk about how when he was young, who usually asked for some assistance. You wouldn't really know anything was wrong until you looked down and saw their feet were on backwards. Him and his friends found a stray boy in the forest with a lost look in his eyes, asking for the road to the fort. They sort of got creeped out, because the only thing he could have been talking about was the city of Ahmedabad. It was a fort a few hundred years ago (there are still gates all around the city that are now monuments to its history), but it's been a city instead for a while.

They noticed his clothes were a little funny, staying away from the woods for a long time after that. We all kind of laughed at the ridiculousness of the story, but gave the woods on the edge of town a wary look. On the whole, though, it was a great time.

A week flew by, said he'd be happy to take me into the city that night. He started up his motorcycle (two-wheelers are abundant in India because they're cheap transportation). I got on back and we made our way slowly and carefully along the road back to Ahmedabad. We saw some people walking around in the villages we passed and a few cars on the road, but not much more.

We passed a section of road that went through the forest. I hadn't remembered that from the drive out, his engine died. We stopped in the middle of a dark road right in front of a small bridge over a stream.

Confused, but the engine won't turn over.

""Do you have a cigarette?""

We both jumped nearly out of our skin. There was a guy leaning up against one of the vaad trees nearby (peepal

""Sorry?"" I managed to ask.

""Give me a cigarette. I'm lost and had a bad day. I just need a smoke.""

Gopal motioned for me to back up towards the bike. ""Sorry, and the engine came to life. I hopped on, feeling very weirded out and glad to leave.

""WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME A CIGARETTE!"" A harsh voice, and snapped my head to the left to see a gruesome face filled with rage and demanding sympathy.

You know, and his neck and torso stretched over the bridge back to where that guy was standing. His fucking legs were still under the tree. I swear, if I could see his feet, they'd have been fucking backwards.

I couldn't move or talk out of fear. I must have thrown off Gopal's balance a bit when I was snapped my head around because I noticed we slowed down a bit.

Frantically, he looks over his left, his eyes widen with fear, and whoosh.

He give it a hell of a lot of gas and we got the fuck out of there. We ended up making it home safely, so I didn't really know if he'd gotten home okay.

Hi guys! I'm really glad I found this subreddit as I've had a few experiences and having no friends/family who experience these sorts of uh... experiences (WOW I NEED A THESAURUS)

Here's some background:
Since as long as I can remember I can feel things, but I can't see any ghostly figures or mists. I am extremely sensitive to emotions and left over auras of things and places; and this causes me some serious discomfort (eg. Went to a refurbished prison, and was crying the whole night after because of sick, dark emotions not my own. I fell into really bad depression after speaking to a friend about her depression/situation even though I should have no reason to be so extremely depressed.) Ugh. When I drive pass the local psychiatric hospital I NOPE like no tomorrow... Anyways, my main reason for this post is as follows.

My most amazing/unbelievable experience happened in Japan. Now, and during my second visit with friends, we visited the Inari Shrine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha) near Kyoto (seriously beautiful and mystical place). Jokingly, I opened up to soak up the delicious aura (I know it's weird but... that's what it feels like to me) and say hello to what ever entity that was on the mountain. There was a small conversation, but hey, no one takes conversations in their own heads seriously. So when we were lost coming down the mountain, I jokingly asked how to get down to the main part. I actually got a response, but REALLY

Next day, I did not have a map on me, nor have I studied any guides about Shinjuku because I was lazy. LOL. So, following my feelings and voices in my head, I ended up walking the small streets until lo and behold, I ran into a small Inari shrine hidden in some residential street. Literally, I had goosebumps all over... Of all the places I randomly come across after walking randomly I come across a shrine dedicated to the very spirits I prayed to? EXCUSE ME

I proceeded to thank and ask them to show me around Shinjuku. Weirdly, I have no logical explanations for what happened and the  coincidence theory is getting a little stretched.

I´m posting the first thing now and the second thing later. Believe me or not but I know what I saw and I would like someone to help me explain this! 

The first thing happened when I was in the 5th grade or something (now I’m 22 and studying at the University). I came home from school in the evening and my mother was in the kitchen cooking some dinner. When you entered the house from the front door we had a corridor strait forward that was leading to the living room. To the right there was the kitchen and to the left the stairs that’s leading up to the 2nd floor. Well.. My mom was in the kitchen cooking some dinner and I wanted to help her. I entered the kitchen and while I was doing that I looked to my right. In our kitchen at the time we had a sideboard and on the side of that a box full of paper. When I looked at it I saw a metallic looking orb. I´ve never seen it before. It looked like a cannonball or something but brighter than a cannonball but it wasn’t shining or looked shiny. It didn´t levitate or anything. It was just a dull looking orb. Anyhow.. when I looked at it the orb started rolling towards me and down in the box with papers. When it landed the papers rustled. I started to look for the orb in the paper box but I didn’t find it. My mom looked as well when I told her what happened. She thought it was strange and didn’t believe it was something. Like I was seeing stuff. We didn’t paid so much attention to it while we were eating. We had dinner for about 20 minutes or something and after we were done I went up the stairs to go to my room. When I stood in the doorway facing my room I saw the same orb laying on my bed! I looked at it and it did like the first time I saw it!

1368625688.0,1edr73,[DIS][ME] Adventures in Sleep Paralysis,MyHorseIsAmazinger,21,7,14,"I figured you guys would like this story about my boyfriend's sleep paralysis.

A few months before we started dating last Summer, we had been dating for a bit and he was hanging out with his friend who was sleeping on the couch across from his bed.  My boyfriend got sleep paralysis again and saw the same woman, but she was covered in blood.  A time after that while I was sleeping over one time, I got sleep paralysis (Which I NEVER do, had it once when I was little and that was it) but had sense not to look around the room and just fell back to sleep.

Fast forward to last Monday, so he said we should wait to see if it goes away when we move. Late that night I was sleeping over, his mom woke us up early to give him something and he was back to sleep immediately and I was on the verge when I suddenly hear him hyperventilating so I shake him awake and he lays there shaking for a bit then tells me he saw her eyes right in front of his face.  He falls back to sleep again, and then the same hyperventilating happens and I wake him up again and this time he says he heard thunder that time.  He was facing the other direction so he probably couldn't see anything.

Anyone have any advice to make him stop seeing this thing?  I'm fairly certain it's just in his head and doing something that he believes will help will make it stop.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1edr73/disme_adventures_in_sleep_paralysis/

A little backstory, but in a very New Age way. My grandmother was a vegetarian all her life, a strong psychic, and avid user of healing crystals and herbs. My mother, aunt, uncle (aunt's husband), and cousin are all spiritual in their own ways, cousin and I are much more serious about the practice than my aunt or mother. From what I can tell and have heard


Now, as if it were truly happening. I was out with my family, in a park, and I couldn't shake this feeling of someone watching me. Finally, after turning in circles, I found the person watching me. It was an old woman, about 100 yards from me. I shrugged it off as best I could, we left the park and went downtown to some stores. Again, she would be a little bit closer. And as she got closer, and they obliged. After getting home


I have no idea what this dream means. It still terrifies me today, or what it meant. But there's one of my unexplainable experiences, and one of the few ones to truly shake me up.

[My cousins' and aunt W's side of the story!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/13eybr/mefam_undead_uncle_my_cousins_side_of_the_story/)

K is pretty badass. There is almost nothing he is afraid of. He is an international successful motorbike racer and did trips through Malaysia, Laos and other asian countries with his motorbike gang. Sometimes he is on very long trips with his mates through asian countries. There is only one thing he is afraid of: paranormal activities. He has a lot of stories to tell and I will post them if you like, but as this is a story about my uncle, I will only explain his experiences with my uncle.

Sometimes, as everytime he says his name, something very strange will happen. But sometimes my cousin would forget about what happens to him and he just talks about my uncle and mentions his name. Sometimes we make fun of him having said the name.

Once

When my cousin sat on his motorbike and drove off, but there is a wall between the window and the street, so you can't see what's going on on the street). Kind of as if he accidentally drove over something, then hitting the brakes very hard and then hitting the gas pedal, driving very fast.

We were a bit confused

My aunt W decided to call him, but he could not prevent driving over the snake. He was so scared, that he wanted to get home as fast as possible, so he hit the gas pedal. In the mirror he still saw the snake, but was surprised that the construction workers walked around as if there was nothing strange at all. Thais believe that when you walk over a snake, you have to go home as fast as you can, otherwise something bad will happen. At least my uncle believed that.

We were all so scared that the snake may come into the house or something, we decided to ask the construction workers if they have seen the snake. They said no, but there would be a special tree (superstitious Thais believe that these kind of trees are some sort of portals for goddesses, fairies etc. to make an excursion into our world) and they only saw a couple strolling along the street, coming from the direction of the tree, when my cousin K drove by and abruptly stopped his bike. K swears that he did not see anyone walking along the street.

Just recently though I've been seeing it more than ever. And apparently my family has seen it too. Though my sister says she sees a green or blue-ish light. And about a week ago I was almost falling asleep in my bed and I slowly felt myself being shaken. I thought it was an earthquake so I got out of bed and looked on the news..no earthquake... I guess its been bothering everyone here so my mother contacted a friend of a friend who claims to be sensitive to ghosts. I always thought these people were crazy but when she came and walked into the hallway I was able to see goosebumps appear on her arm as she said ""oh wow you definitly have someone here"" that's when I freaked out. She says that she feels its a female and that its not here to hurt anyone. I asked why has it been coming around so much and she said that its attracted to the new baby in our house (my sister had a baby a few months ago).

[Pt.3/My boyfriends family](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/11vvnm/fam_a_collection_of_experiences_pt_3/)


My family has a few strange stories so I thought I'd post them up for you. These are true

Anyway

*For this part I'll divide the stories by house and then add any extras on the end.*

**The bungalow**

My mother was with another man before my father who she had my two siblings to

**Touched**

One night my family was throwing a gathering and it was kicking on late so mum sent Angela to bed

Now I just want to say this stories pretty crazy I agree

Anyway

**Lead foot**
Mum and my uncle say that while in this bungalow (they used to hang out together a lot when they were younger and catch up for a couple of drinks on the weekend.)


**Townhouse**

The townhouse to my understanding was a pretty weird layout but maybe I've just not understood properly or imagined it wrong when they've told me about these stories. My mother lived here with my brother and sister where they often had my nan over and again my uncle. My nan claims to never have heard anything but my nans the kind of woman who would tell you the house next door wasn't on fire when it clearly was and deny it right up to her last breath if she thought it scared you (and perhaps because it scares her?). Anyway the only thing key you need to know about this house is that there was a hallway that circled around pretty much the entire floor plan, down past the lounge room, around to the front door and then you were back on route to the bedrooms.

**Mr. Stompy**

As I said in the last story I wondered if what ever it was that was making the footsteps on the bungalow roof followed them because in this next house they had a spirit they affectionately and somewhat sarcastically refer to as 'Mr. Stompy'. Mr Stompy used to walk around the hallway over and over again in the middle of the night. According to my mother and sister it sounded like a man marching around the house.

**Angelas' experience.**

Angela used to sleep with her door open and she was terrified of Mr. Stompy. This particular night my nan was staying over, this was unusual. So she called out to nan, who called back and told her there was nothing to be scared of, typical nan response and for that night Mr. Stompy stopped his pacing.

**Mums experience**

This was from another night

**Shanes experience**

I'm a little skeptical about Shanes experience as is mum and Angela because sadly Shane ended up being diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early teenage years so it's kind of cast a net of 'did it' or 'didn't it' happen over his experience but he's been pretty adamant about it when he's healthy so I'll put it in and you can decide.

Angela woke up one morning and was walking down the hallway towards the kitchen


**Misc**
 

**Africa**

When my sister was in Africa a couple of years ago she did the whole safari thing with her husband. They camped out under the stars many times with their guides. This particular night they stayed in a camp site where reportedly many men had been killed by lions. That night there was a terrific thunderstorm which was pretty intense but her and her husband were pretty tired so they fell asleep fast. She awoke at some point during the night to someone putting their hand on her ankle and moving her leg over out of the way. She propped herself up sleepily thinking it was her husband but then when a flash of lightning went off she realised he was dead asleep. 

Apparently their tour guides had warned then about ... I don't know what they're called but I liken them to bandits! who sometimes pray on tourists in the plains and steal things from their tents while they sleep. They were warned if they wake up to one in their tent they should pretend to be asleep because these men have been known to hurt or even rape or kill people who have tried to fend them off. So Angela slowly lays back down and the savannah is pitch black except for little glimpses of light when the lightning erupts. She laid there for hours praying and hoping there wasn't someone in the tent with them and if there was that they would just leave without hurting them. Eventually the sun came up and as dawn broke and the tent illuminated she could tell there was no one in the tent. 

With senses so alert for such a long amount of time in such a small space she surely would have known if someone unzipped and left the tent and her husband would had to have been stirring and stretched down to move her leg when she felt it. To this day she can't explain the experience in Africa and she gets visibly pale.

**Cats**

I just found out Wednesday after talking to Angela about my experiences with the animal that curls up on the end of my bed that she often feels cats jump up and run across her bed when she's going to sleep. She won't even be dozing yet and she'll feel it

**Mum**

**Flemington**

We used to live in Flemington a couple of years ago, plus we'd had a break in through my window so I was pretty toey. Anyway eventually I got it out of her, she was laying in bed reading when she clearly felt a hand lean on the bed next to her. She said it even left an imprint. 

Oh man! that reminds me too! We had a family friend come live with us because her landlord was a dick and often in the middle of the night in our sun room (which her bedroom led off and where we kept our CD player) she would hear someone flicking though our CD collection. Once she pulled the blanket over her head and told it to 'fuck off and leave me alone' and it immediately stopped. Oh man


**Watergardens**

My mother and my sister live together again now. My sister has two children herself now and is renovating her house with her husband and mum wanted to help out while saving for a house so it suited them. About a month ago they heard a door open and close. No big deal, lol) and Angelas white faced hearing it too. First thing they think of is intruder of course but it stops. Mum jumps up ready to fend off the intruder but when she peers down the hallway nothing is there. They do a scout of the house and nobodies entered, all the doors are locked and Hailey is fast asleep (My nephew is in a cot still so he couldn't get out and my sisters husband had stayed at his fathers house.). We were all on Facebook at the time and I've got to tell you, it was pretty great to listen to while it was going on! I had so many chills.

I actually had my own little experience with the hallway the other night but it was really windy so I'm not sure if it was just the wind though it sounded like it was coming from in the house (not a possum!!). I babysit once a week for my sister on my day off from uni and I was sleeping on the couch in the lounge room (at the end of the hallway) where I heard someone come jogging down the hallway. What makes me a bit weirded out was that I had my sisters cat sleeping on me and she lifted her head up as it happened and waited.

My friend is a big astronomy freak. He loves to stargaze and knows more than the average person when it comes to space. So one time he and one of his buddies decided to go to the middle of bum-fuck no where to stargaze. They drove to a field where an abandoned farmhouse stood a couple hundred feet into the field. 

They decided to check it out, they both heard whispers coming from the second floor. Then they heard footsteps coming down to ground level so my friend booked it out of the barn before his friend could. 

His friend didn't emerge as quickly though. Instead what my friend saw was a large legged creature that looked like a human

1331581707.0,qtcfq,[Me] A haunted house and mild possession.,Mathari,15,1,8,"Me and my wife rented a house from her grandmother about 4 years ago. It was a nice two bedroom house in a small suburban neighborhood. We didn't start to notice anything strange until about a month of living there. The first thing we had noticed is that we would leave the house and upon return our radio and TV would be on at full blast. I dismissed it as electrical issues and we started unplugging the electronics before going anywhere. There were a number of times that we would come home and the oven would be on or a faucet running water. So after about three months of this craziness we did some research online and decided to try a Ouija board to contact this spirit and find out why it was so annoying.

 So the first night with the board we got no responses or anything. We tried again the next night with sucess we had contacted a spirit who claimed to be the previous owner, radio, TV, and computer all began to not work properly. The final straw for us was that I was mildly possessed (my wife says I cant validate this claim as I dont remember anything). She said I started mumbling in my sleep, and then i was speaking at full volume in what she said sounded like some kind of northern european langauge (I speak no other langauge than english) and then I just got quiet and fell back asleep.

The house was situated so that you walked in the front door and could see right down a narrow hallway, which was accessed by a steep pull-down set of stairs situated at the very end of the hallway. My parents and baby sister slept in the bedroom on the main floor. My room was your typical attic: always cold and shoddily finished, with sloped ceilings that creaked with the wind and a small circular window overlooking the front yard. Despite the drawbacks, I was happy to have not only my own room, but my own LEVEL of the house, and I thought it was cool that instead of a door, I had a staircase (I figured I had more power over who was to enter my room that way.) My room was a short, as it sat directly above the hallway

One night, as the house was full of noises and sometimes they woke me up. But I remember feeling that I shouldn't to go back to sleep. I looked at my clock and it was shortly after two in the morning. I sat up and something I saw in my peripheral made me freeze immediately. Someone was standing at the other end of the room, by the stairs. I remember sitting as still as possible, not even breathing. I didn't scream or run or even turn on the light. I just sat there and stared, terrified. The person began to walk towards my bed, and as they got closer, I could tell that something was off. It wasn't a person, but still somehow ethereal. As they got closer, though I couldn't tell you what side he was on.) The man's clothes were ragged and dirty, as if he had been shot dead. But he never landed.

One of the main ideas that Amit Goswami postulates is that consciousness is separate from matter, and our consciousness is just part of a whole, separated only by our physical bodies. Perhaps what we think of as a ghost is actually just an imprint of possibility; what that persons consciousness would do if their body hadn't died.

This isn't** *my* **story. But I trust the source. Not only was he a law enforcement officer, truth, and honor. 

This is his story.

*Frankly, who was back in town, and he spoke to me about it.*

*Knowledge of the physical environment is essential to an LEO in Patrol. It is one reason why seniority counts for a great deal in this line of work-the longer you work a given jurisdiction

*Part of it, has no perception of private or personal space. We can go anywhere, given correct circumstances. And because of that, a great deal of 'idle time' or 'routine patrol' is spent exploring. Can you get a patrol car through the gap in this fence? Where does that track lead? Is there a way to get from this parking lot to another? If you walk this easement or power-line access, what will you see? This is essential, because at some point this knowledge can mean shaving thirty seconds off a response time, or catching a fleeing subject.*

*In every police jurisdiction of any size, or the crime scenes you use to scare Explorers, but the real thing. The places that nobody talks about much. The places you don't find out about until you have to go there. The places you go to only if you have to. We have a place that is sometimes called the Patch. Its about thirty-five acres of very broken ground covered in scrub oak on the edge of town, completely isolated from everywhere else, out beyond an old brick plant that now makes clay pots. Nothing, as far as I can tell, have ever been built there, cut by numerous gullies

*The City seized it for taxes back in 1932 from a land company; it was listed as 'waste land' (no commercial use) back then.*

*Its really a strange place. I've been on search teams across it six times in eleven years, and frankly, a short walk on foot into it gave me such a bad feeling I never went back without a reason. It wasn't until about eighteen months later that I learned that I was not alone in my reaction to the place.*

*One factual thing that bothers me about the place, an unerring instinct about the direction north. I can always find it. Night time, snowstorms, forest, whatever; give me a few seconds to concentrate, and I know which direction north is. Even the desert, which screws many people up, even on featureless terrain such at Fort Hood

*But every time I've been in the Patch, I started taking a compass with me.*

*Near the center of the Patch is a structure we call the Playhouse. Its a building made out of sheets of old galvanized tin nailed to thick posts and four-by fours

*Secondly, but has no purpose. There's no animal pens near it, nothing; just a wood framework with tin nailed to it, no tar on the roof-seams, no doors (but several door-way sized openings), no windows at all. Inside its split into at least a dozen 'rooms' by either more tin sheets, or partitions made out of old packing crates from the railroad. Some of the rooms are completely isolated from the exterior walls.*

*There is no logic or reason to how the rooms are laid out; several have openings that are barely 3' high. It reminds you of how kids put together a fort or tree house. Except that this one has cut-down telephone poles for roof supports set several feet into the ground. Whatever else you can say about it, its been there since before the City seized the place, and with all the generations of kids, you would expect some beer-drinking, ghost-hunting, or general spray-can antics. Nor is there any sign of animals taking advantage of the shelter, nor have I seen any bird's nests, as well. No specific odor. Just odd. And flashlights fail in it. Yes, getting dimmer and dimmer until they just fade away; rather

*Some time in the past, for reasons best unrelated. A search was mounted. I was tasked with taking two officers and checking the area around the old brick plant and the Patch.*

*I had two veteran officers, than for having an excuse to bring my MP-5 along. I wasn't alone in that, as unbidden, both Flash &amp; MD got their shotguns out of the arms room. Flash had a 14"" pump, and MD a Benneli semi-auto.*

*We searched the Patch first; and although all three of us were carefully keeping track of where we were in a place we had all been in before, we weren't splitting up. At all. Anywhere else, we would have been twenty to thirty feet apart walking on line. Here, we stuck together. We had been on other search teams which had gotten got hopelessly jumbled and separated in the Patch before.*

*It was late afternoon when we went to the Playhouse. The sky was completely overcast, and there was a cold breeze out of the north. To say it was a miserable day was an understatement. We circled the Playhouse, looking for footprints, and found nothing. However, drainage was such that it was possible that they could have been washed away, so a search was necessary.*

*Inside, although the dull light through nail holes made you think (unpleasantly) of animal eyes in the night.*

*I led the way in. Twenty feet in a portable metal detector (a wand type used to check for weapons) that Flash was carrying suddenly started beeping, it worked perfectly.*

*We were clearing the place like a hostile building, just not the way such a place should smell. I can't explain it any way better than that. I was on one knee checking out a closet sized-'room' when abruptly the light on my MP-5 died, going from white &amp; bright to dead in a couple seconds. Flash took point and MD center while I tagged along and switched batteries (I had a couple full-charged spares on me, as well as two more flashlights and some cylumes).*

*A minute or so later Flash's light died the same way, and we heard something. Flash muttered 'What was that?' and we all listened carefully. It was coming from ahead and to our right; we did not speak at the time, of course, but later, we never agreed on what it sounded like. To me, it had sounded like a sick cat might sound as it whimpers.*

*We moved forward towards the noise, MD was right, kneeling, and I was about two feet to MD's right . The room was about twenty by eleven, with us at the narrow side.*

*And something moved in the far right corner. Flash hit it with his light a second before I did; I remember MD yelling

*To this day, 150+lbs, bull mastiff-sized, in Flash's light, moving fast.*

*I fired, and I fired to cover them as I backed out last. After the first burst, I couldn't see much for the muzzle flash, so I just ripped up the corner with three-round bursts. I fired off the full thirty-round mag.*

*In retrospect, bar none.*

*In the second room

*There was no dog. No body. No blood. Zip.*

*None of us described what we saw the same way. Flash was extremely reluctant to describe what he saw at all.*

*But there are a couple facts: all three saw a target 'in motion'. Despite the fact that we all perceived it as being in motion, despite the fact that we all trained regularly on moving targets, MD &amp; Flash were hunters (I shoot lots of moving varmints), I served in military actions, and both Flash and I had been in fatal police shootings.*

*And we had twelve 12 gauge 3"" magnum hulls and 30 expended 9mm brass. Thirty bullets and 108 000 pellets were fired at a specific area, looked, we could find no hits on the floor, and only 23 projectile penetrations in the tin walls. Out of 138 projectiles fired (000 pellets are 0.36"" in diameter steel balls; 9mm bullets are roughly 0.38), 105 remain unaccounted for. The 23 holes we found were concentrated in the target corner; 9 to the left, 14 to the right of the corner, with the two groups 22"" apart at the closest. As if something solid between the two groups had soaked up the missing rounds.*

*The dept wrote the incident off as an 'accidental discharge'.*

*The girl was eventually found elsewhere.*

*Flash

*Thats all there is to it.*

That's part one. Of course

*This is one story that doesn't get told around the station; in fact, then later said it was a dog and left it at that. He was the worst-shaken of all of us (not that MD or I were all that steady at that point), and he normally has nerves of steel.*

*that was one of the creepier things, the administration members we were dealing with, who have been LEOs here for 40+ and 30+ years respectively, nodded, asked few questions, and **let the matter drop.** I did some digging; the company bought the property in 1881 as one of many parcels it picked up across three counties. The company went bankrupt in 1929 after the crash, and the properties within the City were taken for back taxes (the County got its holdings outside the city

*It was not built on after the City got it. The transfer documents list it as 'waste land', or 160 acres, at the time. The actual property is 40 acres, but I don't know if 'the Patch' conforms entirely to that plat, or extends into what are the old brick plant holdings. It was surveyed in 1851, and was bought by various speculators beginning in 1857, ending up in the first land company in 1877. None of the transfers indicate anything but undeveloped land.*

*So far as I have been able to determine, although it was not used after 1945, and probably impassable not long after that. It was eliminated completely, along with the removal of a couple culverts, in 1960.*

*The tin sheeting is flat, and a retired police officer told me that the support poles were telegraph, not telephone. He did not mention what was the difference, other than period. It was not a livestock operation, at least not one conducted properly. The reason I say that is there are no outside pens, and there are no pens, gates, and sheeting, some smaller. They would make moving animals very difficult. A squatters camp is possible

Looking for answers - 

*the chemical angle has some merits- during WW2 our county hosted one of the largest training facilities in the USA, would be more frightening than a breach in the time/space continium and hordes of Undead pouring through.*

*One point- the place did not smell bad, there were no animals living there, so the rotting feces scent and various musks were absent, which could be it. Chemicals or spills could account for animals not liking the place. Fumes could also account for why I get lost, and why we felt uneasy. It could also explain why it was built so solidly. Certain fumes also disrupt electrical connections, I recall from Army NBC training, by causing minute surface contamination of the connectors. Come to think of it, of course

*Another thing

*You know, and an implausible interior layout: a gas chamber. A place where you run troops in wearing chemical gear, to be exposed to tear gas (or other weapons) in order to learn that their gear works, and how to function while wearing it. Residual chemicals would drive off animals; chemical fumes could account for a sense of disorientation and discomfort. They trained here from 1939-45, very intensively; up to 100,000 troops at any one time. That would account for the 'wrong' way the place smelled.*

*Another thought that has occurred to me since the whole chemical thing, as I noted, means that after the first shot or burst, your night vision is gone (and we were using flashlights anyway). The weak sunlight would not have been easily noticed. Nor was it a lengthy undertaking; Flash had five shots to pump out, MD seven semis, me ten three-round bursts. It would have come as a continuous volley in the space of seconds. If that happened, the bulk of the rounds could have passed through the gap. When the shooting stopped, we would not have heard anything. If I recall correctly

*We did walk around the outside of the building to make sure no rounds had hit anyone (tin sheets do not stop anything), or not. Besides, at the angle we were firing, the rounds would have gone some distance before hitting ground. If the investigators made the same assumption that we did: that the sheets were firmly fixed, it could explain the whole matter.* 

*then and now, and the like. The US uses weaker than normal chemicals, but for example, between 1980-89 14 US servicemen died in such training exercises. The USSR routinely expected 1% losses when training with chemical weapons. Of course any training exercise can cause deaths; at one summer AT the 49th Armored (TXNG) had 11 training deaths in a two-week period. Aviation units always lose people to crashes, and vehicle accidents always take a toll as well.*

*The place was definitely not set up in the manner of defensive works, but I'm pretty confident the whole matter has a logical explanation.*

And more recently: 

*The Playhouse is no more. I did some Net research

*A couple weeks later, punched a road in, tore down the Playhouse, and ripped the whole area up. They dug a massive hole in the middle, which was then leased to a local factory for disposing of ceramic debris. I've driven to the edge. It looks like its been strip-mined, because they are systematically digging big holes, pouring in ceramic shards

And Finally

*A further update: The Patch is stripped of vegetation other than grass &amp; low brush; its pretty flat, and filling has leveled it all out, although its probably several feet higher on the average. They've built a warehouse on one edge, and survey crews have marked it all out; with the boom that's hit our burg, it'll probably be a mall or something in the next few years. I've walked and driven around it. Nothing special in feel.*

*Maybe toilet shards act as inter-dimensional insulation? The only creepy thing remaining: I asked one of the investigators if they checked the tin walls to see if they were loose. They had checked; the tin wasn't loose.*

*I said

*He said

*And it ended there.*

And still more recently (I like to follow up on things):

*Its smaller, and most of the rest is fenced, since the dirt they used to cover the shards is better than the old red dirt, and they graze some horses there. They put a major water main through it recently, and I expect it to be built up within a year or two, given the city growth.*

*I walked across it a couple times for various reasons. Its nothing unusual anymore-just open field. No getting lost, zip. One point to support my chemical theory: when they dug the holes, they hauled the dirt off; the dirt used for cover &amp; raising the ground level was trucked in. Very unusual.*

*The red dirt they hauled off has not shown up at any of the City's various sites

Anyhoo, and have never been able to find anything similar to negate my experience with.  
  I was about 7 or 8 at the time, especially on certain nights. This could be a completely different post, but metallic, feminine screaming and strange-sounding machines running late at night in the middle of a dense forest were just some of the things I've seen/heard around the area since we started living here.   OK, back on track...

So I distinctly remember waking up in my bedroom with a sense that I had to get up and see something. No one else was in the room and I'm a heavy sleeper so this wasn't usual for me.  I also remember being very inclined to look out of my bedroom window, and a woodsy area.  As I stepped up to my window I saw something unexplainable, in short.  It was a bright large sphere of orange light, probably 50-60 feet in diameter, hoovering outside about 250-300 feet away from me.  It was odd in many ways, it was a deep beautiful orange light, similar to if you put an orange scarf over a light fixture... it glowed, and I remember thinking how I've never seen a source of light that keeps all of its glow to itself.   It also wasn't simply a sphere (or circle for that matter, this orb was moving

Aside from this, when I felt this comforting feeling that basically would have said with words ""don't show this to anyone, or tell anyone, it's special and it's for you.""  There was also a low, humming sound that was accompanying this orb-thing.  sticking with that notion that this this was projecting onto me, I told no one that night, the next day, fireball seems relevant

After I saw her for the first time, nothing was out of place. Now, things were falling down and moving quite frequently.

I ended up naming her Betsy, as if taunting or playing with me.

One night, I saw a solid black shadow run past the doorway. This freaked me the fuck out and I got up to look out to the hallway. Nothing.

I was once told by a nurse that she's heard a baby crying in Operating Room B. I never really believed her and thought she was trying to scare me, loudly. I stopped and listened. It sent chills down my spine so I walked by faster. The weird thing about this is that this room is located on the external part of the hospital. This means that there's nothing on the other side of it's walls.

A while back

Sometimes I will hear stomping on the roof above me. But
Yet another night, as I turned the corner, I saw the elevator doors closing and a girl in a black hoodie walk quickly into the elevator. I called out to her to please hold the doors for me. As I reached it, the door closed. I was slightly annoyed. Then, without pushing any buttons, the doors opened. It was empty. I suddenly realized that if anyone would've passed through the elevator doors whilst they were closing, they would've stopped and opened again, feeling pretty damn rattled.

Things were quiet for some time. The atmosphere felt a lot lighter and I was glad. They started up again a while ago.

I was walking towards the back, which really makes no sense given where I live. I was at the doorway when I saw her, she seemed to be holding a hand up. I immediately stopped, whipped out my phone and snapped a quick picture, then backed away and back into the hallway and to the front desk. I was NOT going in there. Just seeing her there made every single hair on my body stand on edge. I had to go back into the room a while later, but thankfully, she was gone. I think what hurts the most of this story is that I had 2 pictures that CLEARLY depicted her. And that phone was destroyed. I think I might have those pictures backed up somewhere, but still there.

Sometimes while I'm on the graveyard shift, I got up and told her I was going downstairs to the ER to take some supplies. As I usually do, I left the webcam running, so she could be on ""Betsy Watch"". According to her, the camera started to violently shake. She compared it to a camera being shaken up by a category 8 earthquake. It was that strong. She thought it was me who was trying to freak her out and says it went on for over a minute and a half. Then heard the main door open, and it suddenly stopped. Then I arrived and popped into view. That's when she asked if I was the culprit. I wasn't.

Everything I type hereafter is built on conjecture and anecdotes; there are no hard facts and likely there never will be. Still

This is a long post. I'm telling my story from the start. It's not meant to entertain as much as to just get it out there.

My morbid curiosity started it all. A few years ago after I moved back to the US from overseas I worked at a temp job where I did truly next to nothing at all. It was a 40-hour-a-week paid lunch break with internet access. It was only supposed to last a month

The other co-worker who hung on was an ex-journalist for a semi-prominent newspaper in his 50s whose life was ruined after being busted for tax evasion. He told some wildly entertaining stories on everything from dining with relevant political figures, Bigfoot, and other 'Paranormal' phenomenae.

Around that time

He attributed his encounter out there to Bigfoot

Later anecdotes collaborated the ex-journalist's story

I did some research of my own and pulled up a highway patrol report online; once they were publicly available

&gt; ""A Trooper responded to a report of a vehicle in the ditch on Sale Barn Road (also known as Spook Road). Upon arrival, the driver said that a name suddenly appeared on the windshield and she felt ""a force"" seize her head and push it against the driver door window. The driver admitted following the car very closely, saying they wanted to get away from the farmyard. The driver of the second car was cited for following too close and the lead vehicle was pulled from the ditch with a wrecker.""

It was enough to make me seek to break my own boredom with a jaunt out there.

The road is hilly and cuts through a river that snakes through it five times

I called up my good friend from college and decided to head out one summer night to see for myself. Having seen some odd things in his own time, an onslaught of nocturnal flying insects from hell, and all five bridges both ways.

We made up for it by sharing a few more scary stories

I let it go at that.

I was unceremoniously cut from my do-nothing job with little notice and switched over to one of a far busier nature. I began pursuing my Master's degree and my wife had our son.

I made mention one day of finding it incredible that I was actually researching Satanism and the Satanic panic dealing with purported ritual murders and abuse back in the 80's. One of my co-workers there perked up at this, but is just there to work and then go home and do things typical of his age.

I finally found time to ask him what interested him about the articles on Satanism I was reading

I am not a Christian and am quite aware that LaVeyan and Setian Satanists are about as harmful and socially dangerous as a fart in a crowded room. I told him as much and he clammed up.

It bugged me that he so quickly clammed up like I shut him down. Apparently he had more to say on it. I asked him again later and he said we'd need more time. After we got off work

He told me there were groups in the area that were practicing 'black magic'. I thought on this and recounted the story my friend had told me about those 'pointy-hat' figures processing through the field at Spook Road.

He nodded his assent, but downright terrifying.

He said that sometimes after crossing the fifth bridge

I asked him about the van and he told me that it was apparently the one they used to transport their human sacrifices that took place at a barn that was converted to a ritual workspace.

Up to this point I had been skeptically amused

I was appalled at this idea and my stomach twisted in knots.

He went on to tell me that he had been followed on some nights from Spook Road and that he still saw the same cars idling by his house from time to time. He firmly believed that these groups were not small

Despite the knots in my stomach

My later discovery of an article addressing accusations of Satanic Ritual Abuse in terms of law did little to assuage my fears. How could such a thing be so prevalent as to require an article from an officer in this area finding it necessary to actually address the issue with an essay? The article is located here:

[http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume6/j6_1_2.htm](http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume6/j6_1_2.htm)

Returning to the conversation with the kid

The whole thing sounded ridiculous to a rational mind, the idea of a group that follows you home and sacrifices infants immediately resulted in the typical and irrational (perhaps not?) fear of a parent for the safety of our child.

I told the kid I wouldn't be joining him due to the admittedly over-cautious fear for my newborn son.

I still couldn't sleep though. The idea of something so plainly 'unnatural' actually existing outside of the bounds of a story terrified my mind

I went to my brother to discuss my fears. He was working on his doctorate in psychology and had already given successful counseling to patients. We are both rather intelligent

As I told my story, the sacrifices, etc. in much the same detail. He had been conducting his own personal research on the same phenomenae due to one of his patients apparently being a victim of one of these groups.

The patient manifested as classic ritual abuse victim, the hair stood up on my arms', my eyebrows rose. He told me little else due to his strict adherence to confidentiality agreements.

I've spoken with others who have been out on Spook Road and also reported the road changing and becoming terrifying. Another co-worker and friend admitted to going out there and refusing to ever go back due to an occurrence where the road 'changed' on the way back.

I later changed jobs again to my current job and was recently in a conversation with a co-worker who mentioned the Midwest US as being a prominent place for Satanist activities. She said this in the sensible context of a conversation of wholly different and ligher subject matter without provocation or knowledge of all that has been discussed here. I found the knots gathering in my stomach again. Once again

Again

I did end up going back out

The kid agreed to take me and another mutual co-worker who had nothing better to do out to Spook Road

Why did I take the other co-worker along? I stated my reasoning was to have an outside view to ground us. On some level that was true, along came the third party.

We went to the barn first. On Google Earth you can find it at **(43°34'14.62""N, but I found them to be a bit childish to consider as evidence of human and infant sacrifice as much as a bored high school student's afternoon with friends.

While up in the loft, I couldn't puzzle out what purpose the copious amounts of twine would serve to any squatters.

And there was evidence of squatters

As I walked across the loft, I calmly caught myself on the support beams and lifted myself back out. I berated myself for nearly costing my family a lot of money and potentially endangering my son's father's life, but was completely nonplussed otherwise. I only make note of this for later comparison to my emotional/physical state at another location.

The interesting feature of this barn that we noted after I fell through was that other parts of the floor were neatly refurbished with new wood and had strong support

But where was the altar, new floor?

Indeed. A cult whose presence is reputed to go back decades would be smart enough to keep their tools of the trade mobile. If I had discovered an altar

The book may be found and purchased here:

We moved on to Spook Road.

It's actually kind of pretty in daylight during autumn. For a winter daylight view of the road

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aALFwpdnwrU

The kid was adamant that we couldn't be out there past 6 P.M., which we did on foot.

As we explored the graveyard

We puzzled over a dead shrub with plastic flowers tossed into it as being the supposed place of 'binding'

We walked up to it and my queasiness increased. We all remarked on the oddity of a discarded and rather new looking can of lighter fluid that had obviously gone unused sitting on the ground next to the large bracken. Had some rather dangerous prankster chickened out?

We all peered into it and saw what we all agreed looked like a path into it. None of us could make a step forward and we all laughed at it. And still didn't take a step forward.

I shook my head and asked the kid to go down and take a look. My guts were roiling and I was honestly terrified. I had nearly fallen through the floor of a barn earlier without rattling my nerves in the least

Let me stress

If you have Google Earth, but in 7/7/2007 it looks a bit rounder. By perhaps 9/7/2007 and definitely 10/5/2008, it looks very dead.

This tree didn't look like it was harming anyone, removing a tree from isn't terribly expensive, why leave it to rot for years?

The kid said it looked like he could go further in

As we were leaving, decided to hide behind a tree. The sheriff stopped and asked what we were up to.

Apparently I had gotten my nerve back

I wondered why a sheriff would need to patrol so lonely a stretch of road

We moved on to the last location, and no one else was there (it was very cold at this point, so it was understandable). We traveled throught the woods at a fast walk without event to this location:  **(43°29'54.02""N,  96°35'52.02""W)**. Supposedly black hooded figures had been spotted at this ruined, historical structure and other had seen fit to cover it in graffiti. The kid later claimed he saw a shadowy figure following us here, but did not tell us at the time. I remain especially skeptical of that last bit.

He then bade us visit a pond with odd qualities of being perfectly still despite inclement weather **(43°29'57.15""N, but we were spooked. It was a week night, it was now getting dark, and it was very cold. As they heard us, they went quiet.

I was surprised to find that we all agreed to run away. We saw their truck parked to ours and noted binoculars sitting in the passenger seat (we likely noted this out of mounting paranoia).

I understand that this is not precisely the scariest story ever told

This is all I've done so far

Please share your thoughts.

UPDATE: I got a few missed calls and a message stating the kid had gone hiking down in the area and located human remains. These remains could be more archaeological due to the Native American tribes that dwelt in the area

I have a family and have decided to no longer have anything to do with any possible cult activity that involves harming people. When you have a joyful little child, you just can't bear the thought of ever risking anything (no matter how implausible) that would so overtly jeopardize the incredible bond that grows instantaneously between all members of a family that loves each other so very much.

When he first moved there nothing really weird happened to make us think the place was haunted until about 4-5 months in me him his brother and sister and mom all heard whispers and small things of that nature but never said anything about it just ignored it until it would get worse and worse so we started sharing our stories with one another but nothing really bad.

About a month later they got 2 dogs from a friend a German Sheppard and a pit/lab mix they went to pick them up and when they entered the house almost immediately they went for one spot on the hardwood floor and started clawing at it and no one could figure it out it was very weird and every now and then they would just go and claw in the exact spot for like 5 mins at a time and quit until by the time they moved there was almost a hole in the floor.

Another weird thing that happened was me and my friends mom were hanging out watching t.v my friend at school i was waiting for him to get home me and her were the only ppl there for sure his dad was at work and there is no way up the stairs without going through the living room where we were. so we were watching t.v and all of a sudden we hear his dad's voice from upstairs say ""HEY WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING"" we looked at each other and because we both knew for sure no one was there we bolted out the front door and didn't go back in for a few mins it was very creepy.

Another occurrence  another friend of ours came over to see his new house he had lived there for almost 1 year now if not a lil longer this is the only account of physical contact that i know of. He went upstairs to see his room and we left him there for just a second to get us all something to drink on our way back he ran down the stairs screaming and when he calmed down he showed us his back which had 5 or 6 large scratches on it a couple were starting to drip with blood we all freaked out and he never came back over.

And here is the topper this inst really an occurrence as it is just part of the house after staying there for a while we had heard from someone that lived there for a very brief time that a man lived there at one time and he went mad and locked his wife and daughter under the stairwell chained them down under there and tortured them before going upstairs and blowing his own brains out. well this sparked our curiosity so we ripped part of the carpet out in his room and there it was bloodstains and upon further inspection of the stairwell you could see claw and teeth marks in the wood which really freaked us out because that's the one place in the house that is the most creepy it just fills you with dread.

well that's about all i can really remember besides small things like whispers or the dogs barking at nothing for several mins at a time i hope you guys like this it is my first post here and i just had to share with you guys my stories

1312120043.0,j4tj7,One of Many,BlackRain23,16,3,28,"Okay, because I’m used to speaking directly to people who take nearly *everything* I say incorrectly, because my hearing is stronger than it should be for some reason.


Anyway, differently named street, is all thick forest. Briars, snakes, giant spiders, trees two men thick to saplings the width of my fore arm, which is roughly four inches, most said football field length being a rock-spread drive way


There’s several paths to the forest, but I still use the path out force of habit, and both houses on that property being uninhabited, and abandoned to the point that someone still owns it, pays taxes and such, but no one lives in it, or repairs it. I knew the people in both houses before they were ‘abandoned’, so I’m not doing anything illegal when I use that path.


Description done. Okay


I go out to this… plateau type rock formation in the woods at least twice a months, but because if I see anything out there, I want to be able to confirm it happened through someone else’s experience as well, so I can do this sorta thing here,  rant on and on while forgetting my original point.


Anyway, out there, just to make sure they’re not gonna go on a rampage and fuck something up in *my* territory. I normally, when I go out there, see some things that would be labeled weird but most people. Even skeptics would say, ’That’s freaky, but this is what caused it…’ or something.


One night, those idiots who make fun of this stuff instead of at least considering it might be true. Only three people experienced at all in this sort of thing were me, my friend, which nicknamed Siege because it you roll together ‘Cj’ that’s what if comes out as, and my brother, Rustin. There’s five or six other people out there with us. Which they jacked my Ouija board, which I’d only used once, Siege


Nothing has ever actually gotten up there before, precautionary.


Tidbit: Me and Siege always go out there with ‘battle-ready’ swords


I was messing with my katana, all that, while chatting with my brother and Siege about the two creatures we saw down there.


The entire time we’re watching these things the two of my dogs that were with us were staring at the same rough places that we were. The one that is *my* dog, as he was on the verge of bark or growling.


Let me take a moment to explain these two things…


One was a… Vampire? But like… In spirit form, it’s face was pale. Like, copy-paper white pale. I couldn’t make out any more details, as it was twenty to thirty yards away, new moon, partly cloudy, etc etc.


The other one was a huge… Like eight foot tall monstrously built humanoid. Naked, you know, elongated, oval-ish shaped skull? Except the bottom was sort of squarish. It was closer than the spirit, so I could make out more details. It was climbing through the trees, and jumping around after I found it and studied it for a few seconds. The only reasons I got this much detail out of it is because we were out there for an hour or two watchin’ this thing, and I’m rather good at using my peripheral vision, it’s just black for some reason or another.


I’ll try to draw what I remember to the best of my abilities later


For a few minutes before we spotted the leecher spirit, but it went on draining from the other two there. Since we didn't have anything like salt, holy water, what have you, I had to give them a crash course in links. Siege was the only one who needed it, because he didn't have a background with it other than what I'd taught him. Rustin, on the other hand, so he did that


As suspected, but that's to be expected, because he's new at it, even more so then than now. At least he killed the link and kept it from draining him further.


In the middle of one of my sentences to Siege, almost simultaneously. Keep in mind these five or so are the people who were joking and laughing about it. The only one that didn’t yelp is the one who lived in a haunted house for a few months. The one that screamed? Twenty year old man, engaged, three year old daughter, the works. He was acting all bravado, typical ignorant courage.


I walk over there, and they stuttered out a few things, which for the life of me I can’t remember what the spirit or whatever the Hell it was said.


After I calm them down, and because that white thing was jumping through the trees ahead of us and such, I unsheathed my katana, and held it out to the side, giving a stern order for *everyone* to stay behind me, even the other two who were decently experienced in this stuff. 


We’re almost to the part where we’d be safe from whatever, and the dude that screamed just runs past me, yelling expletives,  shoving my then-dead, and still dead, brother’s fiancé and baby-mama(if you’ll forgive the idiotic slang for a moment), into my blade. Luckily the way I was holding it, though.


We got back to my house, but just didn’t seem to be able to leaving the tree line. Dunno why. 


When we got to the driveway though, that thing could probably still get him, easily, which we, at the time, thought was true. Once we stopped to do that, however, specifically the tree the white thing was perched in. This, or thought it couldn’t win. Very intriguing; tried researching it


We get back inside and me and Siege just feel something watching us the whole night, I was like, ’Dude, what?’


That continued until I was to sleep, woke up feeling weird, but altogether, things were back at their normal pace, just seeing shadows flock around me, trying to keep out of my direct vision, finishing peoples sentences, etc etc. Average day. For that, and thus die of a stroke or something.


This bit happened roughly… Eight months ago? It was in November, the one I mentioned in there that was already dead at this time, but it was a week or two, give or take a day, after the funeral, so probably… The twenty eighth or something.


Another random tidbit… I have *never* seen any small animals, seeing at the mileage of just the stuff behind my house is roughly three by two or something. Heard birds. Heard insects. Just never. Freaking. Seen. Them. Ever.


I’ve got loads of other weird crap, ghosts, all that stalking me all the time, and I’ve pretty much gotten so used to it that I don’t notice it’s not normal until I read /nosleep, /x/, or this subreddit or watch a ghost movie. That means I could try, but I likely couldn’t get as many details as you guys would prefer. The only one I can think of that I could is the banshee bit, friends.


I been saying that I'm quite used to malevolent spirits trying to jack my world up


Debunking welcome, if it’s actually scientifically tested and proven, anyway.

this happened when i was 14 (im 19 now) but i remember it clearly, an upstairs which consists of 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (one of whish is in the hall way adjacent to a guest bedroom, further down the hall is my parents room (master bedroom with a bathroom in it) and across the hall is my bedroom, on the middle floor (which is only 4 stairs down from the upstairs..i dont understand why it doesnt count as part of the upper floor) theres the garage, kitchen, dining room and living room. the kitchen has a staircase leading towards the bottom floor of the house (not counting the crawl space under the house) contains the t.v.s couches, and bathroom

well, leaving it pitch black (to conserve electricty) and i had woken at 11:50, and sat up, i had to let my eyes adjust to the darkness, as i looked across from me, there sat an old women. (i know..cliche as it sounds)she sat in the green chair across from the couch she seemed to be reading and didnt notice that i had woken up, i rubbed my eyes and made sure i wasn't dreaming and sure enough, turning a page in the book she held (it looked fairly thick..like a old school bible)
she had this whitish look to her...extremely pale..white hair bundled up on top of her hair, i looked back and it was gone..she stood up and i did everything i could to break my stare at her..i felt frozen, but as soon as she took a step forward it seemed like all the weight had been taken away from me and i bolted towards the stairs, i didnt look back for fear that she would be there, i turned the corner and ran into my room slammng and locking the door and hiding under my covers.. i had no idea what or who she was.. but i know that scared me more than ive ever been in my entire life.. i dont know why i was frozen.. why i couldnt move or look away..or why she was there in the first place..the only other experience i've had in that house was getting up to go to the bathroom...again at 11:50 (weird.. i dont know why...) and as soon as i opened more door and stepped into the hallway i saw this orb of light..about 4 feet off the ground float from the guest bedroom through the door of the bathroom (it was shut) i immedeatly turned around shut my door again and went back to bed.. that was the last experience ive had there...and also the only two times i had woken up aat exactly the same time.. (this was two weeks after the first encounter) to this day i dont know who or what they are or what they wanted..or why me... i just know that my dad agrees as you walk down the hallway you feel as if your being watched and if your walking upstairs it feels as if something is trying to pull you back... not to harm...but like saying turn around..",,False,t5_2sntx,True

Background Info: I moved when I was 12. My old house was surrounded by woods and countryside. My new house is in a suburb and right next to the interstate. My grandmother died when I was a Sophomore in high school

** Okay, blue bouncy balls at our house. We used them to play catch and that was about it. One day, at my old house (I was like 8 when this happened) I was running around in the woods. Suddenly, I see one of our blue bouncy balls fly out from behind a tree and bounce before stopping at my feet. I ran behind the tree expecting my older brother. I saw no one, and the tree was only about 20 feet from me. I would have heard and seen someone run away if they had thrown it. I was terrified and ran back into the house.

** Second ""story"": Shadow People.**  When I was younger and living at my old house in rural Tennessee, was there, the shadow was gone. This happened hundreds of times at my old rural house, but it hasn't happened once at my current residence. Sometime later I read that these ""shadow people"" are the spirits of Native Americans. I don't know the validity of that statement, but it wouldn't surprise me as my house was close to a section of the Trail of Tears.

** Third ""story"": A Tap on the Shoulder.**  This ocurred at my current residence and it was a few years ago. I was maybe 16 or 17. I was sitting on my computer playing games, no one was there and I would have heard someone run off if they were trying to trick me. Plus, I turned around instantly. They wouldn't have had the time to run away. I tried to debunk it as a muscle spasm, but I've had muscle spasms before and this felt, distinctly, like a finger tapping my shoulder. Perhaps it was my deceased grandmother trying to get my attention. I don't know.

**Fourth, Cody grabbed a blunt object) expecting a burglar. We darted behind the couch so we were out of sight of the porch doors and waited for what felt like an hour. It was probably only like 10 or 15 minutes. When we figured out that no one was out there, we got kind of freaked out. While we were back there, we would periodically peek over the couch to look at whoever was trying to get in. (Our porch doors have several windows in them.) We didn't see anything there.

I still cannot explain any of these experiences. The Shadow People could possibly have been my young mind playing tricks on me. The rest are completely strange to me.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/iyl6i/childhood_experiences/

My mom used to clean my aunt and uncle's house for extra cash when I was a baby because she wasn't working and was a stay at home mom. She would bring me over in my little seat and let me take a nap while she cleaned. She always felt uneasy in their bathroom because their house was long and skinny with one entrance and it was the last room; if she was all the way down the hall, so she was always on her guard anyway making sure he didn't pull one on her. 

My cousin, whatever. One day, my mom was cleaning the bathroom and right behind her, the bathtub faucet turned on full blast. It really scared her a lot, but she just turned it off and took a little break. She told them about it the next time she saw them, and they all agreed it was definitely creepy. 

Fast forward a year or so and my aunt and uncle are out and about and they see the nice older lady that they bought the house from a few years before. She asks how everything is going with it and they say they love it. My uncle throws out something about how every month or so

They still see stuff sometimes, I would be out of that house.

I then told him the dream. Now John and his family are Jehovah's Witnesses

Personally, especially because John and his family do not think of death that way. I find it strange though that if this really was a visitation from a spirit in my dream that he chose me to come to, especially because I did not know him.

1372308576.0,1h5rkp,Apartment 301 [X-post from r/nosleep] [ME],Kitty_Crisp,21,8,15,"**The following are my encounters with the paranormal while living in my first apartment. This building has been a hotel, nor do I think I ever will. Enjoy.**

My first experience was the worst. It was probably four months after my fiance and I moved in
I was laying in bed, I heard my fiance's closet door nob rattle (We have separate closets here). Obviously scared out of my wits, I froze, and latched onto my cat.

*click*

The door opened. No lie, who responded by shooting out of my arms, down the hallway, and into the living room, presumably to hide under the couch and let me deal with this entity on my own, the little bitch.
As soon as the cat left, bowing my body. Somehow I broke free of my fear-paralysis, and started to vault off of my bed. Just as I thought I was free and clear, the energy reversed, and I was sent flying into my closet, ankles dragging across the bed, on the opposite side of the room from his closet.

I woke up on the moment of impact.

His closet door was open.

Needless to say, with every light in the house on. My fiance works the night shift, and was confused, to say the least, since I am the cheap-ass in our relationship and am usually avid about wasting things, including electricity. After a tearful explanation, he smudged our apartment with white sage (we both are Pagan and practice Wicca), in the hopes that it would prevent whatever the presence was from returning. I feel like I need to clarify here, I would have taken this as something that happened to me while I was fully conscious. I believe that it was a spiritual attack. Why

While I haven't dealt with what I dubbed the ""Closet Demon"" again, the majority of the ""pranks"" were directed at me. Possibly because even though I love horror, and am obsessed with anything paranormal, I scare fairly easily when it's happening to me. This is the reason I can't play survival-horror video games.

The pranks started with the washer lid being opened in the middle of the cycle. Always before the water drained. First, or I thought maybe even the cats were playing with it and opening the lid. Every time after I found it open, I would find sopping wet articles of clothing strewn throughout the kitchen floor. This is what gave me the idea it was the cats, as I certainly didn't throw my wet socks down there. It was never more than a handful of items, just enough to make me say, ""What the fuck."" This happened three or four more times, and I eventually ruled out both myself, by continuously checking the make sure the lid was closed after I started the wash, especially for my clumsy pair that have a habit of falling into bathtubs and making hilarious fails trying to jump from the couch to the recliner.
It was easy to ignore the washer thing, two things began happening simultaneously. I would get home from work, turn off all the lights, and go to bed. When I woke up in the morning, the living room light would be on. Whatever, I forgot, once again, I would wake up in the middle of the night, ""Kitty_Crisp!"" An urgent whisper
One night I was laying in bed and reading, to say the least. Up until now I had been dismissing it as my crazy dreams/imagination. As I'm looking around for the source of the sound, I heard a click from the living room, like a light switch being turned on. With the way our room was set up at the time, and the layout of that apartment, if you stood at the foot of the bed you could see down the hallway, past the bathroom and laundry room, and into the living room. I mustered up my not-so-famous courage, woken up by three different whispers and what sounded like the living room light clicking on and off.

Another explanation to Mr. Kitty_Crisp

Since then we have only had minor problems, etc. that could all easily by chalked up to misplacing things, paranoia, over-active imaginations, what have you. But we are moving to the next town over in a little less than a week, and let me tell you, I will never step foot back in this building again.

In our townhouse, and I would see these shadow people, seemingly children, peering from around the corners. They didn't seem malicious and seemed to want to be around us. It was to the point where we didn't actually fear them at all, we accepted their existence.

They didn't show up only at night, and then moving back to the wall, as if they lived there.

When I was in late middle/early high school

On one of the first nights in the house, as if it fell off of something or was hit. But since he had only a mattress in his room and was so careful with it, no one really believed he broke it. 

When Mom &amp; Dad got us moved in, bay window. Gorgeous. The downside is that's about when I started noticing things. 

For starters, just that sensation you get when someone else is in the room with you. I would walk down the stairs and just get the sense that someone else was near. That sort of thing. 

One day while home alone, was with me (our only pet at the time). Belle's ears perk up. I listen, and suddenly hear footsteps walk from directly above me (parents' room) through the kitchen and to the top of the stairs, where they stop.  I froze. Belle kept watching the stairs... not growling or anything, but it's clear she heard them, too. Problem was my parents and brothers weren't even close to being home yet. They didn't actually come home for another couple of hours. Suffice to say, I didn't go back upstairs until they came home.

Probably the most confusing and definitely nerve-wracking: while I was drifting off to sleep one night

One night a while later, and I just stare at the closed door for a second. The door creaks halfway open. I book it to my room as fast as I can. 

After I told Mom about a few of these experiences, things calmed down. The house didn't seem busy. I felt comfortable there again.

Not long after, and my chair happened to face the house's addition. 

I was looking at the bay window, and they were sitting around the fire with me. So the sage was either temporary or didn't work on these particular spirits.

It was the summer of 2010

""You know what happened here

Of course I didn't, I mean grade school young. He would bring them back to the house, take them into the basement, and cut them up on his table saw. Then, he would bury them under the crawl space. 

My friend told me that one of the girls managed to escape and hide in the attic. Now my friend's house is just absolutely massive, she accidentally locked herself in the double attic. 

At this point I was questioning my friend's story very much, littering every wall. I was horrified. 

The carpenter had apparently let her stay up there because he knew she would starve anyways

My friend then told me that about 6 years ago things were getting really bad at the house and they had a team of paranormal investigators come in. I couldn't believe what I saw on that video. When they entered the double attic, in the corner of the attic, there was a little girl curled up into a ball staring at the camera. The cameraman screamed and ran down into the regular attic slamming the second door above him. I was scared shitless.

Here's where my experiences come in. It was a couple months later, and I agreed before he even finished the suggestion.

Later on that night we were in his room again watching TV getting ready to pass out. He's kind of a hippy type guy and he had beads hanging from his closet doorway, but what happened next did.

We heard three sharp taps on his window. Being the macho guy my friend tries to be, shaking with the cracking voice and all. He told me there was someone in his yard watching him. When we both went to peer out of the window again, whatever was in his yard charged the window. We both screamed, closed the blinds, and ran into his living room. We could hear scratching noises from his room like someone was trying to get in. We slept in his grandmas room that night. 

The next morning we went outside for a cigarette, was his screen from the window.  It was torn into pieces and there were scratches on his window.

Story: My mother grew up in a very small town and my grandfather passed away probably ten years before I was born leaving just my grandmother alone in this country house.  Whenever we would visit my grandmother I would hear her muttering to herself while she sat in the living room, or if she just missed him that much that she talked to him because it made her feel less alone out there by herself. One night though my older sister was sleeping on the pull-out couch in the living room and awoke in the middle of the night to a bright white male figure standing in between the foot of her bed and the window. My mom believes it was her father.

Final Story: My sister was a single mother and moved into a house with my nephew who was around 3 or 4 at the time and a friend of hers who had a young daughter a year or so older than my nephew. Strange things seemed to happen in the house, things of that nature. Where it gets pretty creepy is that my nephew began talking about something he called ""Cheeto"". He would always talk about Cheeto and would get really weird when we tried to ask him questions about it. One day he finally told us that Cheeto lives under mommy's bed (in the basement bedroom) and tries to play with him and bring him to ""the hole"".

To understand the stories, about 30 minutes east of Kansas City. Another important landmark is Lexington, MO is about 30-45 minutes from there. Now as for my family, my mom believes in the paranormal, and I do, too. My dad refuses to believe it, and up until recently, either. I will move on to my experiences now. My sister believes in the paranormal as well.

We had gotten a neighbor in the lot immediately next to ours and my dad was friends with the couple that lived there. One day, and we all talked about it, but none of us had heard it. 

Another experience I had was one with a spirit I call ""the Blue Lady"". At the end of the trailer closest to our driveway was my bedroom, the light from the hallway would go towards my bed. Except that on this night, it didn't. It was almost as if a black wall had engulfed that part of the room. I didn't feel safe going over there. so I slept on my sister's bed. I can't say how long I had been asleep, but I can say that I was woken up by something.

A hand was resting right where my collar bones meet my sternum and somebody was gently shaking me awake. I open my eyes and freeze. There was a girl in the bed, and she was just staring at me, leaning closer. At some point during this encounter, I passed out. I awoke the next morning and asked my sister if she had seen the blue lady, and she sneered and said no.

Another happening at the trailer was the hallway. It sounds trivial, like hitting a wall.

**The First Time I Saw Her**

At this time I was in my first year of art school.  I was never home that often because I was schooling full time and working part time


One particular evening I was doing homework in the living room with the TV on


I was hunched over drawing on the floor when I started getting a very uneasy feeling that I was being watched or there was another person nearby.  I tried to play it off as if the stress of trying to finish my drawing coupled with lack of sleep was making me delirious.  However

Just as I'm about to get up and close Vanessa's door I see a woman/girl with long black hair and a white gown or set of pajamas walk from the left side of the room all the way to the right, but I know what I saw.


It took me forever to muster up the strength to close the door.  I turned the TV up louder and continued drawing


**The Second Time: Closing the Gap**

The second sighting of this female, Tiffanie was in her mom Vanessa's room.  I was in the kitchen washing the dishes before prepping dinner while asking them what they wanted to eat.  I was yelling out options and getting responses from both of them.


I picked up the last dish and started scrubbing it.

""How does salmon sound?"" I asked as I focused on my task. 

From the living room

I just started to turn my head over to my left to yell louder and ask Tiffanie since I had not heard a response from her yet, cheekbones, a chin, flat nose.  Almost as quickly as she came, she turns to her left and walks up the staircase at an unnatural speed.

All I could do after that was loudly say ""What the FUCK?!"" in a shaken voice.   I knew that was not Tiffanie


I was visibly disturbed and they kept pressing to tell me what just happened

From August 2010 until May 2012 I worked as a security intern at a local hospital. I was only 16 when I began and I thought it was the coolest job ever. And it was a very interesting job. Being security I had access to every room in the hospital. I typically worked second and third shifts, I usually got stuck with this job. But I didn't mind it because it was usually just an hour of walking and I got to snoop around. When I worked days I never had any problems. I would hum to myself and talk to staff. However, third shift was another story. I would hear and see things especially in the cancer center. It would also feel like I was being watched. 

Possibly the scariest experience I had happened in summer 2011. I was working third shift and I had been dispatching all night

This post is about when I finally experienced something that convinced me.  It's kind of long and a three-parter--one experience that was mine

I went to college at a university that was founded in the 1890s and has a major hospital that was built in 1927 (and added to since then).  For a couple of years, you would sometimes have to spend the night in the lab to make sure the subject got to sleep on time with all their electrodes in place and to wake them up on time in the morning.  During one of my night shifts, I put the subject to bed at 1:30, made sure the computers were recording, locked up the office, and went to one of the spare subject rooms (Room C).  The subject rooms were basically like hotel rooms that opened onto a typically hospital-like hallway.  Other than the subject in the room across the hall, I was alone--the research hall was fairly short and closed at both ends by wooden double-doors that were locked from the inside at night.  I closed the door and went to the sink in the room to splash water on my face, feminine voice right next to my ear.  It seemed really loud, but nobody was there (and the door was still closed).  I stuck my head into the hallway, my point is that at no point did I assume it was a ghost or anything weird like that.  I think I even forgot about it by the next morning.

A couple of weeks later, several weeks earlier, he had been sleeping in that room (Room C) and had a nightmare where he was in the room, floating up in the corner by the ceiling, and there were two female nurses and a little girl with long dark hair by the door.  The nurses were struggling to hold the little girl still while she was screaming and kicking.  One of the nurses stuck a large needle in the girl's arm and the girl looked straight at H and screamed at him for help.  Then he woke up.  He said that he normally doesn't remember his dreams and that it was the most vivid, horrible dream he'd ever had and he couldn't get back to sleep that night.  But hey, it was just a dream

Until the next day, started freaking out over H's story and said that, a few nights earlier, he had also been staying in Room C.  Before turning in, he went to a cabinet down the hall to get some extra blankets and, when he turned around to go back to Room C he saw a little boy and a little girl standing right next to the door.  After a second, they disappeared.  Of course, just like the girl in H's dream.  

So when I heard from H about his and M's experiences, I took my digital voice recorder in the room, said ""I'm leaving this here overnight so, if you have anything to say, now's your chance.""  And then I slept on the cot in the office.  But in the morning, when I went to check the recording, I discovered that the batteries had died about 10 seconds into it.  Might be a coincidence, since I had only used that recorder once before

To top off the whole thing? (And this is going to sound fake

I had been hardcore crashdieting to lose weight. My Aunt (who is also my boss) knew about my diet but she did not know how sick I had gotten, but I didn't throw up at all either. I did have a fever and body aches though. Wednesday I got up and got ready for work and was throwing up violently from the moment I awoke. I went to work anyway, as I am a single mom and bills don't pay themselves. Wednesday I was throwing up at least twice an hour from the moment I woke up. My aunt knew I was ill, but she thought it was due to my diet or due to maybe a virus. I stayed at work my whole 10 hour shift. My aunt did not know I was now so sick at this point that I was not eating at all, but throwing up stomach bile.Thursday I called in sick to work and stayed in bed again. If I stood up, I threw up. I thought I had the flu, due to my Tuesday symptoms of fever and body aches. Friday I got up and got ready for work. I was still throwing up and by now looked horrible and my eyes were bloodshot from constantly throwing up. I showered, and went to work. I got there late because I had thrown up again right before I left for work

I got to work, you don;t need to be here. You are going to pass out. Also, I had the worst nightmare about you last night that you were seriously ill and in the hospital."" She sent me home. 

Due to her dream, give me some nausea medicine, send me home to rest. I was wrong. They took a urine sample and said my liver enzymes were elevated. Then they did an ultrasound to look at my pancreas and gallbladder to see if one of those was the reason. I think they took blood already at this point too. Then, I was admitted. My potassium levels (supposed to be in the 3's the nurse said), were in the 1's. I was told I had gallstones and was being scheduled for emergency gallbladder removal surgery the next morning at 8am (they had to stabilize me first, rehydrate me and get my potassium levels back up to normal). The next morning I had my gallbladder removed. My aunt was there in the hospital with me. The doctor told her that my gallstones were so bad that they had completely blocked my bile passages, and that is the reason I was throwing up so much. Had I not gone to the ER that Friday

Tldr: My aunt knew I was sick but did not know the extent of how sick I really was because I kept that business to myself. She had a terrible nightmare that I was seriously ill and ended up in the hospital. Got sent home from work the day after she had that dream so I went to the ER to hopefully get some nausea medicine

This was about two years ago, her optimism. My dad had brought all kinds of her posessions with him when he came to live with us, so I had keepsakes and mementos from her, including one of those pretend toddler cloth peek-a-boo dolls that stand up by themselves in the corner with their faces covered. The doll was a bit creepy so I kept it in my closet, out of the way, but I didn't want to get rid of it because when she had been alive she had said that it reminded her of me when I was little, and I'm a pretty sentimental person

In my greif, I thought maybe I could use them as a link to encourage her to speak in death. 

So I did my ritual, so I just accepted that I had failed and moved on and didn't think much of it again for a few days, until unusual things started happening. Nothing frightening at all, but curious.

1343433877.0,x9x0e,[ME][FR] The Silos (x-post from r/nosleep),AwesomeIncarnate,18,6,9,"It was the summer of 1999.  My mom filed bankruptcy on the house and we packed up our things.  My brother decided to stay with my father and I went with my mother.  That summer my dad took my brother and I to Sea World before dropping me off at my new home that my mother was busy making ready.  And so I began my new life in Tivoli Texas.  


It's a really small town.  Driving down I-35 you can drive through it in a blink of an eye.  The town didn't have that much going for it.  A Dairy Queen, bar, gas station, and a motel.  The town consisted of mainly Mexicans and some white folk.  Through some way or another I was related to half of the town as well.  Our junior high and high school were in the same building with one major hallway.  That is how small it was.


Due to the fact that my mother was Mexican and my father white I wasn't Mexican enough or white enough for the town.  Thus I encountered racism for the first time in my life.  And thus began a chain of depression and failing grades.  It wasn't until I failed my freshman year of high school that my mother decided to send me to a different school.  And so I began school in Port Lavaca home of the fighting Sandcrabs.


It was another small school.  By small I mean kids from Magnolia Beach, Port O'Conner, Seadrift, and Tivoli all made up the high school population.  But it was here that I finally met people who didn't judge me based on the color of my skin but on my personality.  And quickly I made friends.  It was during this time that my brother moved back in with my mom and I after things didn't work out at my dad's.


When I was about 16 and going on 17 I met my now ex boyfriend through a random chat room on AOL.  He knew about the tiny town of Tivoli due to the fact that his school and the Tivoli school competed in sports, mom of course, my friend who we will call Meg, and my other friend who we will call Joe.


We were having a great time just chilling at the house


Now these silos were across the street from my aunt's house.  When my friend who we will call Regina came to stay at my house she asked if there was anything spooky with them.  Because honestly they did look pretty spooky.  They stood tall and ominous with rust spots here and there.  Overgrown grass to hide them partly from view.  When I had asked my mother and other relatives about it they never told me the history but they were adamant that I stay away due to coyotes or whatever else may be living in them.  I always thought it was strange that the history was never shared with me.


I of course told this information to my ex and friends that were with him.  Slightly intoxicated in the humidity we all decided it would be a great idea to go and investigate.  So


I didn't get very far because unlike my friends I was wearing sandals and ended up stepping in an ant hill.  So after I had gotten the angry buggers off of me I watched my friends begin their exploration while I waited in my ex's car.  I was smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio when after about 10 minutes they all came running out.  Quickly they piled into the car and we went back to my house.


After calming down they reported seeing shadows of people and red eyes as well as whispering voices.   Thinking it was the alcohol I brushed it off.  The rest of the weekend went fine and life returned to normal.  After those events I really didn't think much of the silos as I concentrated on school.  That was until about a year later when my friend Regina stayed with me.


My friend Regina has always held an avid interest in anything paranormal.  And the silos were no different.  One weekend she was staying at my house and wanted to investigate.  My cousin (who we will call Brady) and my neighbor (who we will call Mike) was interested as well.  So they came over to my house when I told them of our plans to investigate.  Her boyfriend (who we will call Mark) decided to come along as well.  This happened around October if I remember correctly.  It was also my first time inside of the silos.  We waited until my mother and brother were asleep before walking that way.  We came prepared with flashlights


Upon walking in there during the night with very little light save for the faint glow of flashlights I felt...Uneasy.  However we pressed on looking around.  There was a metal grate under us which did not prove interesting as the ground below it there was nothing but trash.  I noticed some feathers laying around in which I remembered something about my mother stating that the La Chusa lived there.  If you're not familiar it's a creature that's part owl and part woman.  Or a witch that turns into a owl with human features.  However


After looking around the outside for a while we decided to go into one of the silos as the wind was picking up and it was getting a bit chilly.  Shining our lights around we found a noose made of metal wire.  We also did find my cousin's name Brady written inside of the silo.  It was a little creepy.  I felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck and heard whispering in my ear.  Though thinking it might have been the fact we were inside a cylindrical object made of metal it might have been the echoes.  It wasn't until I felt an invisible force grab me and pull me towards the middle of the room where the noose was that we started to freak out.  It also didn't help that we heard a woman crying and singing mournfully.  We didn't wait to see what would happen next as we ran out and back to my house.  Since we were too freaked out we didn't manage to capture anything with the camera or our cell phones.


Once those events happened we didn't go back to the silos.  And it was soon forgotten in my mind.  That was until about a month or so later my cousin Brady told me that my neighbor Mike and him had gone there late at night.  They were too afraid to tell me what had happened.  I do remember my cousin Brady telling me that my neighbor Mike had fainted suddenly and my cousin had dragged him back to his house.  It was there that Brady's mom did performed a La Limpia.  Which is a Mexican egg cleansing ritual on Mike.  Brady told me when his mom cracked the egg it was bloody before she flushed it.


It wasn't long after that the silos were torn down.  I wonder what history there is behind those silos or the land...",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/x9x0e/mefr_the_silos_xpost_from_rnosleep/

Anyway we were drive down this road, and like the stories said the car was moving forward. It was the most wonderful experience. It was so slow and peaceful, it felt like we were floating. And we WERE NOT on a slant. If it was gravity pushing us down a hill we would have gained speed. We never did gained any speed. We were pushed all the way out of the bridge and the same constant speed. Im telling you the truth. Most people say you were just on a little hill! No we weren't I promise you that. Anyway the rest of the drive home was normal nothing unusual. The next day we were bragging to my sister about the whole adventure! As me and my uncle were explaining what happened he turns to me and says ""I didn't want to tell you last night because I didn't want to scare you but I saw some black thing run past my window""! I was so surprised and then I told him the same thing happened to me but I didn't tell him because I thought it was nothing. It was the most creepiest thing that has ever happen to me. I haven't had a chance to go back to the road but I would love to! I love paranormal experiences excpecially when they happen to me!

1338493666.0,uedar,Strange and scary event at the campsite [ME]....,Mcready,16,4,17,"So

This event happened when I was approximately six years old. To be clear I have an excellent memory and have very clear recollections of my childhood from the age of four onwards. I can remember things from before I was even at school with incredible precision and the things I describe here are burned into my mind with great clarity.

When I was a kid I spent a lot of time on a camp site in Sussex. My Grandparents (who looked after me and brought me up) used to own a caravan there and we would go almost every weekend or school holiday.

It was a pretty magical place and in stark contrast to the rest of my childhood and teens

The campsite that we used to go to was considered safe ground

This campsite had a large lake in the middle of it and often my Grandfather would stay up late for a bit of night fishing. One particular night he and a friend were sitting by the lake fishing and I was out and about playing on my own. I stood around waiting for someone to catch a fish but quickly got bored when nothing happened so wandered away from the caravans further along the edge of the lake.

It was quite dark and there weren’t really any lights around once I had walked far enough along, this is where my amazing memory of my childhood falters a little bit because I can remember looking at the top of the tree and seeing something, but I don’t know what. I remember whatever it was that drew my eyes to that tree meant that I was compelled to stand on tip toes and reach up to the corner of a branch growing out of it.

Then, seriously, I’m not making this up, something grabbed me and I could not move. I felt something that I can only liken to a very sudden electric shock. I remember it was even more disturbing because I couldn’t even flex my fingers, my entire hand felt numb, like it was stuck in treacle.

I could hear a noise that to this day I have trouble describing, I couldn’t even see my hand as everything was in the shadows, all I could observe was what looked like a frantic movement of something just above my wrist. I could make out what seemed like the tips of something dark moving about very rapidly. I tried to pull my hand free but however much I tried I could not get it free from whatever had grabbed it. I do specifically remember that sudden shock of my hand being grabbed and this weird numb feeling.

By this point, but nobody came, despite the fact that there were caravans and my grandfather and his fishing buddy about 15 metres away. Nobody came to help. Just as total fucking hysteria was setting in my hand finally came free and I fell backwards, looking at the tree above me I could still see nothing. The feeling had returned to my hand and I quickly ran towards the caravans to look at my arm.

When I got to some light I looked at my arm, no marks, nothing at all. The skin felt a little bit weird, like it was hyper sensitive. I shouted over to my grandfather and asked why he hadn’t heard me but got no response, he and his buddy were just sitting there. Freaked, I ran to the nearest caravan, where I knew that my Grandmother was with the wife of my Grandfathers fishing buddy watching TV. I burst in, really freaked out.

I remember asking my grandmother if she had heard me screaming, I tried to explain but her and her friend just sat there, looking at the TV like they were in a daze. I ran out of the tent and continued to look at my hand and arm. I then ran back to the caravan and looked through the glass at my Grandmother and her friend, then back at my Grandfather completely freaked that everyone seemed to be oblivious or unresponsive to me and what had just happened. By now I was crying, and sat on the grass trying to make sense of what was happening.

About 2 minutes later and my Grandmothers friend came out and asked me what was wrong, she could see that I was seriously distressed and decided (perhaps to try to calm me down!) to wrap my arm and hand in a bandage.

I was then taken back to our caravan by my Grandmother and went straight to bed and lay down. I slept terribly, eventually I must have drifted off into a really deep sleep and I woke up very refreshed. As I got up I looked down on my pillow and found to was COVERED in blood, streaks of it all over, I quickly ran to the mirror and found my top lip and nose caked with dried blood, it seems I had some kind of massive nosebleed during the night. Then I remembered the bandage on my arm, I took it off, scared at what I would find, no red patches

The whole thing was swiftly forgotten about by everyone except me, every now and then I get a really intense pain in that same hand and wrist, to the point where I cant even use it to carry anything. The pain comes and goes at random, sometimes not happening for years at a time, but to this day it still happens.",,False,t5_2sntx,True

Two sons of a wealthy plantation owner were fishing, hauled him out and hung him from a tree by the bayou (really just a man made drainage ditch to keep the area from flooding to bad). The legend says that you can see his ghost at night sometime (i.e. hanging for the tree

We decided we would go to Juju road to consume a few beers and the illegal drugs we had (cannabis). We were just sitting around B.S.ing and having a good time when someone started saying they saw someone walking up the road. Of course, a Honda Accord that had never before nor since gave me any problems). My car wouldn't start. It just turned over and over and over, but wouldn't start. My friend in the passenger seat started freaking out and pointing in the direction we saw the figure walking from (in front of us). We look up and see a ghostly figure with a rope around it's neck walking toward us. I started to kind of freak out, because my car has never failed to start. The figure kept walking toward us and we can finally tell it's not a real person. We were all kind of freaked out, when I finally got the car started. I made a u-turn and hauled ass out of there. We never went back there to party or hang out.

Back in the late 90s my parents had a brand new house built in the suburbs not far from Chicago. Back then we were one of the first families out here. It's crazy, and no bare plot of land to be seen. Anyway, on the next street over there was a family who arrived before us. Growing up, these folks were like a second family to me. The family consisted of a mother, father, three sons, and a sister. One of the sons, his brothers, and sleepovers. A lot of wonderful memories came from this time.

Here's a quick story that also happened to me:

A few years ago my friend Matt and I decided to try out a Ouija board. I didn't believe they worked

So the night comes and we're both sitting in Matt's room. Matt goes around the house and makes sure to shut off all the lights (nobody else was home). We light some candles in the room and begin asking questions. Mostly stuff about future current events and politics. We get some answers

Matt swears up and down he turned all of them off. I thought he did too considering it was completely dark outside his door the last time it was open. The light wasn't exactly hard to miss either.

Matt was a lot more bothered by it than I was. To this day he refuses to do something like that at his house again.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/oi8i3/frme_something_in_the_basement_xpost_from_rnosleep/

I was living in an on-campus suite with 3 other guys for about 6 months. One roommate, but never really had much experience with it. One night it was just Jerry and I and he wanted to use a Ouija board. (I know a lot of people think they’re BS, and most of the time, they are if you use them incorrectly. But the few times I’ve used one I’ve had very interesting results)

So we sat down and started. Something started just going to different letters

For the next week I had horrible nightmares

Jerry actually approached me the next day and told me about a dream he had about his whole family dying. I mentioned my series of nightmares. All my roommates stopped and mentioned that they have also been having dreams of loved ones dying. Well shit. This was bad.
Jerry and I decided to use the Ouija board that night while the other roommates were at class. It went to random letters again.  We took out the batteries to the remote

So I brought in a Wiccan friend who does a lot more spiritual things than I do. He picked up on it right away. It was him, my other roommate, Jerry’s girlfriend, and myself. Jerry’s girlfriend was asleep on Jerry’s bed. Well after a while of not being able to communicate with it, Jerry wanted to go check on his girlfriend. So Jack, Jerry, and I go into his room, he arches his back in pain and jumps back. We go into the bathroom to check his back. 6 scratches on his back. It looked like something with 3 claws scratch him twice. One was on the right and shorter. Maybe about an inch and a half. The other one right diagonally across his back and must have been about 5 inches long. I have a picture of it on my old phone. If I get enough requests I’ll try and find it and see if I can upload it. Jack made us leave the apartment while he blessed it. I saw him prepare a cup of water

After I did some research

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Demon_lovers_cover.JPG) is a picture of what they're believed to look like.

TL;DR Spirit was giving all of my roommates nightmares and would turn the TV on and off at our command. Escalated when one roommate was scratched and ended when we got the house blessed.

1326443577.0,of8sh,[FAM] A light in the sky (X-Post from Paranormal),yoyobye,14,1,3,"This is a story my father has told to me a couple times in different settings. My mother actually prompted me to ask him about it when I randomly asked if she had ever heard of any paranormal or ghost stories.

My father grew up in Union, with lots of farm land around. When my father was in his late teens or early twenties (during the mid-'70s), he was riding home in his friend's truck around two or three in the morning. They stopped on the side of the highway near the Hot Lake Hotel where they relieve themselves before making the final leg of the journey home.

As my father's friend, and seemed to be circular. My father describes the light as extremely bright, but produced no sound. The source was at least a couple hundred feet up in the air, but he couldn't make out much of what it was coming from. After ten or fifteen seconds the light started moving across the field next to him and off into the distance. They couldn't make out the outline of the aircraft producing the light.

He wanted to write it off as a military aircraft or something, and after shooting the breeze with this friend, asked him without prompting if he remembered anything unusual about their drive home that evening. His friend recounted the story just as my dad remembered it, and that was the first time my mother ever heard the story.

I've prompted him multiple times to see if he was joking, but everyone suspected that was more of a cruel joke than anything paranormal.

I believe he saw what he saw. I just don't have any better explanation for what happened than he does.

So I thought ""okay

I tried to communicate with it via pencil and paper but all I got was nonsense similar to this ""T...TT...P....C...T"" so I thought. ""Huh this isn't working."" And was like ""I dunno how to help it now.""

So then, frightened.

That presence wouldn't leave me alone for months. :(

I turned on my light and do not sleep well. In fact I don't sleep well for the next two months. The lights flicker. My body feels cold at odd times. My head constantly feels a swirling energy upon it right where the crown is. You know, feeling cold or hot. It was like a beacon for me, of spiritual energy, it frightened me so much.

I couldn't watch scary stuff on TV or in movies because every time I did I would begin to energetically feel cold. Like something bad was going to come through if iw watpched or read enough bad stuff.

I would try to talk to stuff during this time. Close my eyes and my ""spirit guides"" questions and they would push my head right for yes or left for no, its hard to explain, but I felt like stuff was around me all the time during this tme.
Sometimes the energy on my head would grow so hot that it would feel like there was a ring of fire on it, then on the 3rd, it was gone.

When she was in high-school, and after a few minutes peaked out.  She said that the figure had moved to the doorway, and seemed to be beckoning her.  It looked like the shadowy form of a little girl.  It seemed to want her to come out of bed, as if it wanted to play.  My friend just went under the blankets again, and eventually was able to fall asleep.  The next morning at breakfast she told her mom about it.  Her mom told her something that she had never known before.  My friend had had an older sister, that had died when she was very young.  This had happened before my friend was born.  Her mom told her that her older brother (about ten years older) had seen this spirit several times, and that it seemed to follow him around.  Ever since then my friend has been convinced that ghosts exist.

Another experience she had, her boyfriends father was out of town, and my friend went over to his house to stay with him while his father was gone.  They were sleeping in his parents room, because it was bigger and had a more comfortable bed.  One night, very late, they were laying in his parents bed, and they began to hear footsteps outside in the hallway.  They got scared, Christian, this time getting louder and louder

1317311404.0,kvdka,Another Voice,not_good_at_lurking,14,2,6,"Ok, I'm not a skilled writer.  I'll do my best to explain what happened.

Before I get started, I hadn't seen them much, which was especially hard since I had grown accustomed to cohabitation and being on a college campus where it's almost impossible not to see friends every day.  So I was feeling very lonely basically.  Add to that the fact that I was at a new job where I was hired in anticipation for coming work, and suddenly I'm very lonely, and have 8 hours every day to do nothing but contemplate my loneliness.  Secondly, I am one of those people who usually think in an internal monologue.  This inner voice sounds like my speaking voice does.  After several years, I've come to recognize it pretty well.

So, and sure enough I was still alone.  Then I realized I hadn't actually heard the voice.  It was in my head.  Well, that startled me me a good bit, needless to say.  I began to get a little worried, since I know there are mental disorders that can cause things like this, and a mental disorder at that stage in life could easily cost me my job.  But then this foreign internal voice started comforting me, telling me I was not crazy

A quick aside, but ""she"" (as I'll refer to the other voice for simplicities sake) got very offended when I brought up that idea.  Oh, right.  We had conversations.  It appeared she could hear my internal monologue, and thus my thoughts.  We conversed several times over a few days.  She demonstrated a disturbing amount of knowledge about me and seemed to almost be able to access my memories.  I asked several times who she was, if she wasn't just my imagination, but she always just got offended that I didn't believe she was real, and refused to give me a name or anything about who or what she was.  The best answer I got was something along the lines of ""you'll find out soon.""  That had me a bit worried (which I know she knew), scientific person should

So why am I posting this, but I'm still a bit concerned about the whole finding-out-who-or-what-she-is-soon thing.  I also halfway wonder if she may still be around, just keeping quiet and listening to my thoughts, which is a rather uncomfortable idea itself.  So what do you all think?

My second year in Poland I lived in a nice and relatively new apartment with a girl in my class.  It was a 5 story building with an internal stair case.  I lived on the third floor. As you opened the front door to my apartment immediately in front was the bathroom. To the immediate right was my roommate's bedroom

We were on spring break and had just returned from a week in Berlin. We still had 2 or 3 days of time off and decided to watch a movie in my room (equipped with couches and a T.V. that hung on the wall -- a luxury in Poland). The movie is boring me.

I go into the kitchen and begin to prepare dinner. Spaghetti. Dull and boring after so much of it during school. My roommate and friend are still watching the movie.

It's dark out and we're experiencing our first thunderstorm in Poland as students.

As I'm in the kitchen I hear the front door open and someone walk into my roommate's room.  Having people not knock was not uncommon as our apartment building was shared exclusively with students. People would come in all the time asking for this or that so we would leave the front door unlocked when we were home.  The door had been broken a little bit though so it would always make a loud noise when it was shut.

I assumed it was my girlfriend or my roommate's boyfriend.  

I ask

I walk back into my room and ask my roommate

I shout out to the unknown person hoping for a friendly response from someone I know.  Again

Now we are freaked out.  I shout out again.  The noises stop only to start back up again a minute or so later.

This time the noises are louder and there is some banging. It sounds like someone is opening up some cupboards in her room or banging on her desk.  I pick up a knife, are hard to find there). 

The hallway and our whole apartment is always well lit. I quickly call my girlfriend and ask where she is. She is walking to my place and not very far

Knife in hand, three deep breaths and we barge into the room expecting a fight.

Like I said, was torn apart. The bed flipped on it's side, the wardrobe flung open and all of the clothes pulled out. All of the pictures she had (of her friends from back home and such) on the wall, were taken off and neatly stacked into two piles -- one pile of the pictures she was in, the other the one's that she was not in.  Between the two stacks of pictures was a locket of blonde hair, and black toenail clippings (painted black-- my roommate never painted her nails, especially not black).

1313341560.0,jik01,My father's house was haunted [X-post from nosleep],dantedn,14,1,12,"For a few years in my late teens I lived with my father in his house. My parents had separated the year before and sold their old house. When my dad bought a new home it was three bedroom pier and beam house far on the outskirts of my east Texas hometown. The house wasn't much. Three bedrooms

My dad wasn't there a whole lot. He runs a deer lease an hour away and stayed busy with his new girlfriend in another town. He did not sleep in the house very often


Strange things started happening a few months after we moved in.
I would hear footsteps walking up behind me. Voices in the dark of night


I tried hard at first to tell myself it was my over-active imagination. Or maybe it was just the neighbors were fighting. The footsteps just had to be the house settling. All the excuses I could muster would not stop that shiver from running down my spine or negate the feeling of being watched all the time.


The longer I was left alone, that would only end dirctly behind me. I would turn to find no one there of course, but the moment my attention was back on the computer the footsteps would head back down the hallway.
The voices could be heard anywhere in the house. Day or night, when I hadn't said a word.


I started listening closer to the voices at one point. They were always the same two people I think. A man and a woman. I could never understand what was said, and full of rage.
This went on for three years while I lived there. I did my best to stay out at night and sleep during the day. Then, but there were a few that seemed more like notes to herself. ""Why does he have to hurt me."" ""He called me a worthless whore. What did I do?"" Some even made mention of him hitting her.


Well, into the living room until I could decide what to do with it. That's when things started focusing on the living room. More voices, more footsteps. One night when I was up late cooking all of the drawers and cabinets in the kitchen opened themselves at once.

Four of us were sitting in the hallway of the floor were all the guys were staying. The hallway formed a T-like intersection and we were in crossroads, four of us. Myself, R, J, and N. N was the only female in our little group that night. We decided to do some simple 'experimentation.' Basically, it went like this: one of us would come up with something - an idea, an image, then project it. The other two would then try and open their minds up and 'see' what was being projected. Instead of saying anything out loud

Until we hit on something. If R or I were touching N, only if R or I were. But also, only if he or I were touching her - holding her hand, having our knees touch, or the like.

Discovering this, all of us except for J) tired. Both R and I had headaches. We said our goodnights to one another and each went off to our rooms, N heading upstairs to the girls' floor.

Some time later, trying to fall asleep. I was drowsy, but just couldn't fall asleep. The faint bit of light coming in from the hallway was enough to give the room some illumination, but things just didn't feel right. Then the door opens. Light pours in from the hallway. R is standing there. He walks in - kind of stiff and wooden. Not quite shuffling. The walk of someone who is very weary perhaps. He walks into the room until he's standing beside my bed. Not looking down at me though. Just staring straight ahead. ""Hey, R,"" I said. ""What's going on?"" And in a voice that wasn't quite his own, a voice that was real monotone and somewhat deeper, ""He is coming. The Dark Man is coming. He's seen."" And he stopped then. And laughed. But it wasn't his laugh. It was deep and alien. Creepy and unnatural. Then he stopped

I was finally able to move. I realized I'd been holding my breath since he first started to speak. I lay there

There was a shadow there. Almost as if of someone standing outside, it seemed to be staring at me. It didn't move when the shadows from the bushes and trees moved. It just stood there, still, staring. A cold feeling of dread filled me. I couldn't look away from the shadow. I could shut my eyes, but the feeling of being watched only got stronger, and it felt as if there was a presence, a heaviness in the room. Eyes open, watching.

The first one happened when I was with one of my oldest friends at his university in rural Ohio. I came to visit for a family weekend

We had spent the day on Saturday walking around and checking out stuff, we decided to go back to his dorm. B, being the type of older friend, sort of a brother to me, (He and his sister used to babysit me back in the day.) he of course liked to mess with me and tease me sometimes. Nothing really malicious just jokes and what we would now call ""trolling"". He knew that ghost stories and paranormal stuff freaked me right out, so he casually mentioned that the corner dorm was haunted. Of course I wanted to go check it out immediatley. B decided that we should chill and eat some food and hang out for a bit. So it was about 11 or midnight when we decided to go to the said dorm room. 

Let me give you a little bit of background info to paint the picture in your mind. This was in 1999 or 1998, thick wooden dorm doors, and older 70s (or early 80s) decor. The dorm itself was shaped like a box with rooms all around the outside.Bathrooms in the center elevators and stairs at the middle of the ""box"". The haunted dorm was a corner dorm, and was pretty good sized. Not huge but very comfortably spaced for two college kids to live in. 

B knew the dudes who lived in the dorm currently, this is what B told me and I trust him. After what I experienced, hah I believe him.

So we head down to the dorm, and its quiet. I can't hear anything, the lighting is somewhat dim, but not dark, and my 9th grade heart is beating like mad. I scare pretty easily with paranormal stuff, and I knew some fucked up shit was going to happen. Anyway we get to the dorm, and the guys are inside hanging out. B introduces us as asks if anything crazy has happened lately. The guys kinda laugh look at each other and quickly say no. At this point I the am standing right by the door, with a good sized lock and doorknob on it. The guys and B are talking and all of a sudden a gust of wind(?) kind of blew around the room and moved all of their curtains off of the windows. My hair stood on end, like someone is holding it down on the other side. By now everyone in the room me, and the door opens. We all pile out into the dimly lit quiet hallway

Second Experience

This was about a year or so later, we always hung out whenever I could get my parents to take me to Granddad and Grandmas house out in rural central Ohio. We also are the only two in our family to have blue eyes, and red/blonde hair. We were really close. This guy would crawl into old refrigerator boxes in the basement and play War with me when I was little, and he was in his 70s, what a bad ass Grandad right? Anway, Grandad had a stroke and also had blood cancer so I knew right away that he wasn't long for this world. The last time I saw him he was in his hospital bed, he could only use 1/2 of his body, he grabbed my hand and told me ""K2, but I was really tore up. It was about 1 am and I was half asleep, fills me with a range of emotions

My wife and I moved into a 3 bedroom *rather small* home. We were renting and the landlord was barely better then a slum lord IMO. The house

Before we were settled we decided on rooms, and my wife's brother got the smallest room *not much size difference between the three*. All three where on the second story. However, my kid's room ended up being really really creepy and my kid's would NEVER sleep in there. 

Occasionally, after a time, this was a fairly common occurrence. One night however, I was trying to fall asleep (I have a very hard time getting to sleep) when I heard my daughter come into the room. 

Now, it appeared, was one of those nights. 

Now, and about a two foot gap between the crib and our bed. Just enough room to get back and forth. 

So, saw her standing there, told her to get back to bed and she didn't move. So, after a moment of not moving I got a bit more stern with her, my eyes open all the way at this point. Still, she didn't move. So, I figured she must still be asleep. 

I reached out and went to touch her shoulder to gently wake her and my hand passed right threw her. Now, my entire body went numb.

It remained standing there with an ever so slight swaying back and forth motion, I jumped back and said (rather loudly) WOH.. My wife woke up, looked over and said ""It's just (daughters name) tell her to get in bed."" 

The MOMENT she said that the figure in front of me dispersed as if exploding. No force or anything, which is something she had never done before and never did since.

I told her what happened the next day and she told me she remembered waking up and seeing our daughter

 I apologize for the language if it bothers you, I've always been aware of things being around me. But not like the ""I spoke to dead people"" as a kid, more of sensing presences and little stuff like that. But there was a certain spirit at what is now my fathers home that really disliked me.
   
 This particular spirit was seen was by me as a 3 year old, which became an established safe zone in that home for me.
   
The spirit was never seen by me again, this was all not the end of me being watched by things. 
  
 After my parents divorced, there was the night that was changed. 
   
To start this off, the final remembered moments before you dream to be exact. "" I FOUND YOU "" played in my head, I have a lot of controlled internal voices, and I knew this on was not from anywhere in my brain. It was gravely, and disturbingly excited to find me, almost like I was it's prey.
   
I was immediately wide awake. I shot up, that room had been made out of extra storage space in the actual basement, the rest of the finished space now serves as my ""apartment"". So I no longer can sleep in that room, or stay in there too long at night and its been over a year.
   
Then there was the night I guess was a show of strength on my part. The night I could feel so many spirits closing in, but I could feel them circling me. I don't know if the images in my head were accurate depictions of them, but they were terrifying nonetheless.
   
 I eventually got very, seemed to cause extreme anger. When I did go back and forth, my classmates in high school would comment on my mood changes occasionally. So anger is something I learned to control, but it burst forth that night and I lost control. 
  
 I threatened anything and everything near me. It sounds silly, and I felt almost as if a tether was connecting me to it. I began to feel sick to my stomach, which made me angrier than before. I don't really know what happened, but something made the thing disappear. Not leave, just poof away like it never existed. 
  
 The others left too. My usual nightmares stopped, I woke up one night to my pants having been removed and tossed to the floor on the opposite side of the bed. Normally I would remember doing this, but I didn't. I will not say without doubt this incident was paranormal, but it was strange. 
  
 Then I had my first real nightmare in ages. They always have a meaning I suppose
  
 In the dream I'm stood up in my bedroom. The wall opposite my bed (where I look if I'm looking at my feet in bed) has two closets with sliding doors. My cat like to open them at night
over and over and more joined in each time. I backed up until it hurt and I felt trapped
   
There are more stories for me
  
 D however is regularly speaking to a spirit and dabbling in Astral Projection
  
 I'm not sure what to do at this point. Things have become so quiet paranormally speaking in my life that I'm not sure if it's just coincidences or not. I'd like to talk to some people who are familiar with this kind of thing and maybe have a new perspective to share. Also if anyone is a claimed psychic that thinks they can verify this stuff

This happened to me back when I was in high school living in Canmore, this place being a relatively new area I never once thought that it was possible that our house could've been haunted. Usually you hear stories of ghosts being present in homes at least 100 years old, but our house was maybe 10 if that.

Anyway to continue on, we'll call her Kay for privacy's sake, was out visiting her friends just down the road this particular day, while I was out in Calgary visiting my friend Laura. My mother was home and down in the living room playing on her lap top, while my younger sister, we'll call her Sam, was in her room doing... well I can't remember what she was doing precisely, doing homework or reading but I digress.

While sitting there alone in the room she heard the distinct sound of a small object hitting the carpet by her bed. At first she ignored it, she went back to her task and again, began to hear the soft noise of something landing on the carpet beside her bed. This time when she looked down she seen a tennis ball much like the one that belonged to our littlest dog mickey roll beneath her bed.

She yelled at the top of her lungs for my sister Kay to stop being disruptive and went to go retrieve the ball from under the bed. Just as my mother called back out to her that Kay was not home

The next two memorable encounters had actually happened to me. One time when I was home alone with the dogs/bird and the other with my now ex.

So the first encounter was actually during mid-day on a Saturday. Both my sisters were out playing with their friends while my mother and step-father were out at work. I had gone down to the kitchen to fix myself a snack as I usually just stayed to my room upstairs and played a variety of PSone and PS2 video games. As I walked from the fridge to the island in the kitchen, let out a low growl as hackles rose and she bared her teeth. She kept it up to as I stood frozen, looking on at absolutely nothing. This is the scariest I ever remember her being.

The bird, which actually felt like eternity, I walked over to the sink and ran my hand through the air. It was cold and then suddenly, it wasn't and the animals stopped their odd behavior and went back to being their cheerful selves like nothing had just happened... I quickly abandoned my sandwich for a bag of chips from the cupboard and ran back upstairs. Not wanting to be in the kitchen anymore despite the animals being happy-go-lucky once more.

The final encounter about two months before we moved, step father and sisters had gone to Calgary to go to a swim meet for my sister Sam and would be staying overnight for the second part of it the next day.

It was late that night and my ex at the time had been over (I had permission from my mom, so maybe that's why we both dismissed the fact that my ex had said he seen a face peeking around the corner from the kitchen into the living room. We attributed it to the exhaustion and he opted to head home. As I began walking him to the door, we rounded the corner out into the kitchen which led to an open area with the front door and a flight of stairs going up. As I looked up I froze. On the first landing on the stairs, stood a little girl. She had long brown curly hair, pale skin, no shoes and was wearing a white dress. She had no eyes from what I could tell and this is when I knew what I was seeing was real cause Jojo stopped dead again and was staring with me. I looked to my ex and blinked a few times and the little girl was gone.

My ex still had to go home that night. But I flicked on every light

I've since tried to do research on the area, so unfortunately I couldn't find all that much aside from the typical ghost stories from around the town. All I know is despite the ghost being friendly (I never really did feel threatened or malicious intent while living at this house) it was still the creepiest thing I've seen to see a little girl in a white dress standing on my landing.

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them. I know my writing probably seems to be everywhere but I was just writing as it came back from memory. I have a couple more stories I'd like to share in the future revolving around ghost experiences from me and my family. Unfortunately I don't have anymore from the Canmore house.

(So if you go into my history and find nothing...thats why).

This happened when I was about twelve. For some background info

I had woken up early and was bizarely awake; I was facing my side table and I looked at the clock- 5:05 AM. It was that time of the year when 5 o'clock wasn't pitch black but there was enough of the rising sun to see the outlines of everything in the room. I turned over in my bed and that's when I saw it. It was a black

I froze. I couldn't move or scream but go the energy to pull the blankets over my head. From there I formulated a plan. For some reason I ruled out turning on the lamp right next to my bed and decided my best bet was to turn on the light switch in my room next to my door. I counted to ten and ran as fast as I could and turned the light on. I turned back and it was gone. My parents' bedroom was right across from mine and I SCREAMED down the hallway. My parents had been startled awake from hearing me yell and I told them what happened.

They comforted me and I slept in between them the rest of the night

Do you remember that episode of Jimmy Neutron where they shrink themselves down and fight bacteria or something? I saw these over-sized bacteria-esque things crawling onto and off the bed. They looked like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/YpqZHmt.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/YpqZHmt.png) They were semi-see-through and stood about a foot tall. They had thin

My Mom's experiences started when she was a little girl. Her family was pretty poor (Dad was a plumber, and had an old turn dial telephone installed on the wall. They never bothered to take it down. Then, my Mom started to hear it dial at night. She would wake up to the sound of a number being dialed (slow turn, let go, slow turn, let go, slow turn, and would see a shadow by the phone. She would lay awake terrified at night

Fast forward to her young adult hood. She got married young, so they put the puppy in there at night. A few nights after they got the puppy, they were sound asleep when they heard a loud crash. It woke them both up, so they went through the house together checking rooms (her husband was a police officer). When they got to the dining room, the puppy was shaking under the table in a puddle of pee. In the dining room there was a huge old stone fireplace. On the mantle was a box with wine glasses and a wine decanter. Someone had taken the lid off the box, taken out the wine glasses and decanter, and smashed every one 
into the fireplace. From the sound of it, head to the dining room, smash the wine glasses, and make it out past my Mom and her husband searching the house, while leaving all of the exterior doors and windows intact and locked. 

A few years later, had blonde hair, and was wearing blue jeans and a red and white striped shirt. She was sure she had hit him. She slammed on the brakes, and jumped out of the car. She walked all around her car, and even looked under it, and there was no little boy.  She was pretty shaken, but after a few minutes she got back in her car and drove to work. After her shift, so she was giving them a ride home) when, and once again

Lets fast forward for the sake of the length of this post. I was born years later, the pantry, and the kitchen. I had lived in this house for most of my life and never been afraid, but this hallway suddenly horrified me. It was so bad that I would run as fast as I could to cross it itif I needed to pass through at night.  I told my Mom that there was something bad there, but she told me I was being silly. Then one morning, as I was getting ready for school, I heard my Mom scream my name from the kitchen. The panic in her voice made me think she had cut off a finger or something. I ran into the kitchen, I had been brushing my teeth in the bathroom, lol. I had warned her. After that

This happened to my aunt and cousins over 25 years ago. My aunt at the time had two children (my cousins). They were about 4 and 6 at the time. 

They had just moved into an old house that had previously been owned by an old farmer and his wife. The farmer had died and his wife

My aunt with my cousins moved into the house and there seemed to be nothing wrong. The only one that seemed to not like the house was my cousin Kayla, Kayla was scared. 

Kayla would often tell my aunt about the ""ucky"" man that would wander the halls of the house. Blaming Kayla's vivid imagination

One night

Realizing how scared Kayla really was, whose name is Caroline, had no knowledge of anyone named Margaret.

This is the most paranormal thing that has ever happened to me so I like to put in a lot of detail when telling it. Skip the first paragraph if dont want the background story. This is 100% real by the way.

Happened about 5 years ago, my other friend (we'll call her Brianna) and myself. My friend Brianna has an very unusual Irish last name but for the sake of this story we'll say it's Turkleton? (this will be important later on). It was late, probably pushing Midnight when we opened the box to try it out. We went into my room, locked the door, sat on my bed and all lightly put our fingers on the planchette and to our expectations...nothing happened. Now this went on for a good while. We would take turns inviting spirits and what not to talk to us and about 15 mins in, the damn thing starts moving. 

It was slow, ""Hi Bobo."" (that's what he called her when she was a kid). She starts crying more and now we're really starting to ask questions. Is there a God... is there an afterlife, and he would only tell us that he wasn't allowed to share that with us and that we had to figure it out on our own. We sat in amazement, talking till Dawn. I could sit and tell you all the things he said but I won't waste your time. We decided to end it so my friend Brianna stood up and said her I love you's and her her goodbyes and without us even touching the board the fuckin' planchette moved to ""Goodbye.""

We got obsessed with it after that wich wasn't a good thing. I became a kind of a dark-person because of it. I had wrapped my life into it. My friend John and I would even go to Cemeteries to talk through the Ouija. I'm better now. Had a few more paranormal things happen here and there but I just had to share that experience with you all.

My grandmother has an old cross made of palms that my uncle (father of my cousin) gave her for Palm Sunday when he was younger. According to my mom, so she probably passed it off as a dream

Fast forward to November 2012. The trial for the kid who shot my cousin had finished that evening. The kid got off completely free. Anyways, like someone was stroking it, kind of like what you do to comfort a loved one. I thought it was my fan so I moved out of the path of the air from it. Not even 2 minutes later, I felt it again. I got this crazy thought, maybe my cousin was actually in my room with me. Crazy, since I hadn't seen him for about a year to a year and a half before he was killed. 

Anyways, is that you?"" and the feeling stopped. I asked him to do it again if it was really him, and sure enough, I felt something brushing my arm again. I asked him to stop, and it stopped. I did this a few more times and each time I got the same result: I asked to stop, it stopped; I asked to start again, it started again. The last time, ""OK CJ

Now, even though his killer got let off. It's even more comforting when I think of how close we had been when we were younger, but how estranged he had become from constant fighting with my aunt. I don't know, thinking that makes it feel more special to me.

It was a couple months ago that this happened. I was reading to the point of drunken sleeplessness, on my girlfriend's bed. Usually, I never fall asleep without the covers on because I still get that weird feeling that hands might rise from under the bed and grab me or something. You get the idea.
Anyways, is darker. I remember being unable to move, but my range of vision roamed freely. I suddenly get this overwhelming feeling that something is in the closet. The closet is ALWAYS open, and I'd never wished harder that it was shut. The feeling turns into a knowing, and I am positive that there is something, a woman in particular, in the closet. I try my hardest not to look, I do, or entity, and under the bed. I close my eyes and try to yell
I shook my girlfriend to tell her what happened
I did some research on sleep paralysis
1. I never felt a weight on my body. The entire time I felt like my body just lacked the energy to move at all. Paralysis really is the best description I have for it.
2. The name ""Gene"" doesn't really hold any meaning to me. Neither does ""Jean""
3. The entire time that this was happening
4. I hadn't taken any drugs or had anything to drink before hand.

        When I was six
    As he paddled
    He never told anyone where he was. All I knew was dad hadn't come home in a long time. He was the CEO of a pop-tart plant so he normally came home late. But this was different. Mom would just zone everything out. But she'd leave us with a babysitter every day for two weeks. She never told my sister and I that she was with a search party looking for his body. 
    They found him eventually. The only things that were recovered from the water were his kayak, everything got weird.
    There was a sense of peace in the house again. A few nights went by and one night, there he was. He looked, as I described, ""cloudy"" and he started crying when I told him I missed him. 
    The overwhelming urge to cry came over me at that same time. He told me that it was Really hard to do this. To be here this long. He wanted to see mom so I hugged him and held his hand. He felt cold
    She looked horrified. But dad just whispered how much he loved her through all the fights and how he knows she's sad but needs to take care of us. I cried again. My sister never woke up through any of this and doesn't remember when dad kissed her that night. 
    My sister and I went through months of therapy to understand what death was and how to recover from it all. I had to take care of my family for a while at the age of six because mom has Severe depression. 
    But I remember it all. Maybe it's not healthy but I find comfort in him being here. I'm sorry the story was kind of lengthy and not scary.

1351643705.0,12dd86,[fam]/[me] The Hamlin House,Craigglesofdoom,14,2,5,"When I was eight

The land had an abandoned old house on it. It wasn't TECHNICALLY on our land, and they had moved away sometime in the 60's or 70's and abandoned the house. The first time we visited the house, I instantly had a weird feeling about it, like something about it didn't fit in. But, it was an old house in the middle of the woods, slowly falling apart and getting pulled into the surroundings by trees and shrubs and moss and mold, so it made sense. My dad and I explored the house completely one day, every room. I remember it vividly. It wasn't terrifying, many of them tiny, per usual. The attic had only a trapdoor entrance

Going down the stairs to the basement was horrifying as it was. There was barely enough light to see by, dirty light. The basement was nearly empty, save for a pile of tools in a corner, a shelf on which a bunch of empty jars sat, and then the worst part: A wooden headstone in the corner. The shape was unmistakeable - a semicircle cut at the top, standing about three feet tall and clearly implanted deeply into the soil. My dad and I did the ""I dare you to"" thing again and in the longest ten seconds of my life, slowly walked over to the headstone (headboard?) The soil was compacted just as much as the rest of the basement

Cut to: eleven years later
We go up to the Hamlin House because it's Halloween time and why not? It's creepy. I already told them the story about the grave.
While we're walking
Dad:""Oh
Me: ""WHAT.""
Mom: ""Yeah! It was the weirdest thing! It was just like something getting out of bed. Metal creak
Dad: ""And then it walked over to the stairs and started walking down...""
Me: ""Well what was it!?"" (my friends are pretty freaked out at how nonchalant this conversation is)
Dad: ""I dunno
Mom: ""Yeah
Dad: ""It wasn't scary
Mom: ""Oh get out
Anyway, front door is off its hinges, and ALL the windows are broken.
Me: ""Wow
Dad: ""Whoa
Mom: ""Yeah
My friends are legitimately scared at this point. I'm thinking that's what I get for bringing Noo Yawkahs into the woods of Maine, there is a bona fide blood-curdling SCREAM from inside the house. I actually (not figuratively, or literally) pissed my pants. My bladder actually let fly with a gush of everything it had to lighten my load for the all-out sprint back to my house. This scream was worse than anything in any horror movie, it wasn't an owl, or any other kind of animal. It was straight from the bowels of hell. Every one of the five of us went on 100% animal instinct at that point and hightailed it back down the road. We didn't stop until we were back in the living room of my house, a good three-quarter-mile run for sure.

All our reactions after that were kind of ""Well...haha. What do you think that was?"" Followed by shrugs and uneasy looks. We all took showers in turns (it was obviously necessary for me and at least one of my friends) My dad finally broke the silence by opening the fridge and breaking out a sixer of beer, and quite honestly, I don't think I want to. It can rot into the ground for all I care.

**tl;dr Old abandoned house in my woods in Maine had a grave in the basement

**Edit I forgot about** There's a revolutionary-era graveyard on the other side of the road from the Hamlin House. Two graves are from the 1760s, and then a few more from the early 1800s. One of the 1790 ones says that they were a revolutionary soldier.",,False,,t5_2sntx,1351648879.0,,
1345751664.0,ypoce,spirits can communicate with me in my dreams. [true stories of mine and my family's],iseespirits,18,6,3,"let me begin with a little bit of background information about me. i've always been a believer of spirits, angels


my mom always thought i was a bit special in the way that i could sense certain things, my aunt, and my grandmother. as far as i know, my mom hasn't experienced much of anything paranormal. she's just a bit on the religious side and also believes in paranomal things. my aunt on the other hand, has a crazy history with the paranormal.


our family lives in northern north carolina. i've lived in the same city my entire life. when my aunt was pretty young, open the kitchen cabinets and throw glass dishes at her or just shatter them on the floor. needless to say, the house was up for rent soon after. she didn't know how to get rid of them, or i'm sure she would have tried. as soon as someone else moved in she told herself she was going to go back and warn the new people who lived there. when that day came, she went to the house and knocked on the door. two older men (huge, muscular, beards) moved in. she warned them about the demons who lived in the house with them. they blew her off, ""we don't believe in that shit


about 4-5 years later, but they would show themselves to you if you caught them at the right moment. going to visit her house when i was little (4-10 years old) always gave me the creeps. it had a cold feeling when you walked in, and just gave you an odd creepy feeling. not to mention the house was around 100 years old. brick with some parts painted white, half the paint chipped off of course. it had an attic and a basement, which always scared the shit out of me just looking at the doors. if you opened the attic door, it had the most narrow stairwell with very steep steps leading to the top, and you couldn't see far up because it was so dark up there. i never wanted to know what was up there. same with the basement...i'm getting creeped out remembering it. both my aunt and my cousin have reported seeing spirits in the house and luckily i never did, she divorced and moved out of the house. occasionally i still drive past her old street and within the past 3 or 4 years


my grandmother on the other hand is able to see spirits as well. it's mainly her mother she sees, and she said she felt a tap on her shoulder and she heard my great grandmother speaking to her. ""i knew you would be here."" she said to my great grandmother.


as for me


i've never been super close to my dad. he traveled a lot for work when i was young, but they stayed together for the sake of me and my brother (we were young kids.) eventually alcohol and mildly abusive behavior on his part made it worse. til this day he has not changed. i was always closer to my mom. the only person i was close to on my dad's side of the family was my grandma. 


i loved spending time with her


years and years went by


paranormal or not, so real sometimes to the point in the dream i think i'm actually awake and there. sometimes i have dreams where i can actually feel being touched by someone else in the dream. i have also had a couple lucid dreams before.


my grandma came to me in a dream about 3 years ago. back in the old days my dad's side of the family would gather at her house, and she gave me a hug. i don't remember if she said anything to me because it's been awhile since i had this dream. it was so real, i knew it was her. the moment she hugged me i woke up from my dream, feeling a ton of pressure on my body like i was being squeezed. i began to cry a little bit. i said ""mee mee [that's what all the grandkids called her], if that's you, touch my foot."" it was sticking out of the blanket. sure enough, my foot felt a tingly feeling



now why i thought to write this post; because my grandma just came back to my dream two nights ago. i'm almost 21 years old now, i went back to her old house again. everything looked and smelled just the same. i walked through the door and into her living room to see her sitting right there in the same old chairs she always used to have in that house. i was surprised and shocked to see her in this dream too, because i still knew she died. she hugged me again, saying something like, ""it's great to see you after so long."" i was pregnant in the dream too like in waking life. she touched my stomach and told me how bad she wanted to feel the baby move. i told her little stories about the baby and how just a few hours ago (before i went to bed) my boyfriend had his hand on my stomach and felt our daughter stretching inside me. i told her about an event that only happened hours ago in my dream! this made her happy, she stood there smiling and laughing and then simply disappeared.


i woke up extremely happy, and he feels comforted knowing how much she cares and feels as if she is protecting us all in some way. my pregnancy has been extremely perfect, no complications, our daughter is growing completely normally, and not to mention i haven't had much pain at all (except for lower back pain some days and achy feet and ankles.) 


the next evening i wrote a note for her and left it at her grave. i thanked her for coming to see me in my dream


it was a woman demon with dark brown hair and completely black eyes


what do YOU think about all of this? (my stories). i just don't understand why that evil spirit would come into my dream and do that. is there a name for people who can communicate with spirits in their dreams? i barely know anything about things like this, i know it was a long one.

When I was 13 I was hanging out with my friends one afternoon

My friend Letisha offered to have it at her house

On the walk over to her house my stomach started to hurt. I felt cold, and felt worse and worse the closer we got to her house. I felt really strongly that I should turn and run home, but my manners got in the way. 

When we got there I had to spend some time in the toilet

Anyway I don't remember much of what we did, and in the corner to the right of the door was a massive black mass. It was nearly as tall as the roof, and it's really hard to describe but it was like a pillar of darkness, it was solid in the centre but sort of faded out, I guess kind of like a cloud but black. 

I blinked a few times

A couple of years later my stepsister had a friend staying over, and she was convinced that they had let a demon or something similar into the house. 

I freaked out and told her what I'd seen when I stayed there

1343289146.0,x6ho6,[ME] Unseen Visitor Leaves Its Mark,pandoricahelp,19,5,7,"I figured after lurking in this sub a few days

When I was 16, concepts of good and evil, etc. In some ways I look back and realize I had colored this experience in that regard. However, even looking at it skeptically now I can't debunk what happened. I bore the mark of that night for three years.

It was an August night before my Junior year of high school. The weather that night was particularly bad. High winds and heavy rain bordering on hail made falling asleep difficult. My nerves were already on edge as I listened to the branches from a tree slapping the siding behind my head. As I listened

I'm not sure if my imagination was getting the best of me. Looking back, and admittedly a touch of fear from the whole situation, to something more tense and darker. The temperature in the room suddenly dropped about ten degrees. I tensed up, and over the sound of the wind the rain, and the tree, I heard something that drove the fear home.

It was a laugh.

It sounded like it was outside my window. It was deep and mocking. My childhood instincts kicked in

I had a blue, reading, writing, etc. Now, I heard my chair, the unmistakable sound of it rocking slowly back and forth. I didn't want to look, but I couldn't help it. I glanced down.

In my chair

When I was three

A few seconds passed while I stared. Then I heard it again

I had been formulating a plan in my head, I had knotted up my blanket. I rolled off the bed, standing in the same motion. I kept a Bible on my nightstand, which I picked up in my left hand. Normally I respect religious text (of all faiths), but as I dove for the door, I tossed my Bible at the chair like a holy hand grenade. As the book made contact with the chair, I heard a hissing noise like water dripping on a hot stove.

Door opened, but I finally felt safe. But I wasn't.

As I settled in to try and finally sleep

Then another.

As I listened, then in the room. It made its way around the bed. I cringed. I could feel something ominous looming over me. Then something grabbed my leg.

Since that night, it was painful.

The touch burned. It was like someone had rubbed acid on their hand and then grasped my calf. I could feel each individual finger. The invisible hand pulled on my leg, the pain suddenly flared. I remember letting out a strained whimper, gritting my teeth, and then I think I passed out because everything went black.

I don't remember any dreams. I woke up around 8:30 the next morning, and I actually felt relieved. I went about my day as normal, working on chores, joking with my sister, and whatever else. I remember that after I made my bed, I laid down on it and looked at the plush chair. The plush had a knap to it, so if you ran your hand over it, there was no pattern to be seen.

Later in the afternoon, it was less intense and felt more generalized. I rolled up my pant leg and realized that what I had experienced wasn't a hallucination.

On my right calf, like a bad sunburn. Four fingers could be seen, but the thumb was absent. I gingerly touched it, and it was tender like a burn.

I spent some time that afternoon praying and blessing my room. Whatever it was had seemed to enter through there. Nothing about the room seemed to change, although it was less red. The new development was two small bumps. They looked almost like warts, although I've had one before on my arm and these were different. The tips were pointed, sort of like a zit, but these were just hardened skin. They didn't hurt, in fact I really didn't feel anything when I touched them. The two points/bumps had grown where the tips of the index and middle fingers were on the hand.

That night, that laugh, outside the window. It didn't come back in, though. In fact, I never heard it again after that.

The odd part then was the bumps. The burn-looking mark faded after a day or two, no real pain. And in another month, they were back. They stayed on my leg until I was 19 or 20. I don't know when they disappeared, I just remember washing my leg one day in the shower and realizing they were gone.

Sorry this is so long. I know now that there are probably some very logical explanations: hypnagogic hallucinations, however, is that these events were all true *to me.* I didn't have the training and experience I do today. I wish I would have taken pictures of my leg, gotten those weird bumps biopsied. Still, this stands out as one of the most negative and bizzare brushes with the paranormal that I've experienced.

1341961134.0,wcr24,My experience with ghosts [ME],osty182,15,2,5,"So first of all let me say that I've never believed in ghosts or any paranormal stuff, no twist at the end ... just an experience.
We had a party at my brothers house, ghosts, stuff. Me and my brother thought it would be fun to convince her, to call some ghosts (we actually tried several times before that day but were never successful, she would always say that it was to risky and if anything goes wrong that a ghost might turn violent, messing with peoples lives there). This time was different, probably due to alcohol involved:) we weren't really drunk

-she is going to be the medium (not sure if that is the expression in english). What that means is that she is going to be the only one in communication (talking

- we are going to communicate via alphabetical letters arranged around a table in a circle and with a glass (a typical drinking glass) that was turned upside down and where each of us would put one finger on top of that glass. 

- under no circumstances should we ever remove our finger from the glass during the procedure. Unless it was told so by her

So it began. We would all sit around the table in put our fingers on the glass. I remember I was kind of smiling and thinking: ""this is rubbish, please show us by moving this glass"". Me still smiling thinking what I thought, but keeping it to myself. And I was right, nothing happened!!! At least at first. She then urged us to really focus on the glass and trying to keep a blank mind. She again asked at loud: ""Is there anyone here?"" Boys and girls, I ain't joking, the glass started of moving all around the table. I was really shocked, i mean how can that even be!? I was watching our fingers, who is the one that is pushing it. But with the speed that the glass moved from one side of the table to another ... it was just simply impossible that anyone of us was doing it (to clarify what I mean ... If you put a finger on something and try to move it
So she then asked a few questions: how did you die, ... And the spirit (or whatever it was) answered all of them, until the glass just stopped moving and we were free to release our fingers from the glass. At this time i started to question all my beliefs. To this day I do not know what happened. Were we really talking to a person from the other side, or was is all just a prank? And yet a have no logical explanation for either of the possibilities. 
Let me just mention that the walk at 4 am from my brothers house to my own (just a 100m walk) was really terrifying. Scared shitless. So thats my experience with ghosts.

1341207813.0,vwv3z,Door Opens and Closes by Itself [Me],ducktai,17,5,4,"This is my first time submitting to this subreddit - I had a weird experience a few days ago that I figured would fit in here.

I'm attending summer classes at my university, facing the doorway. I should say that the building was built in the 1930's, so it's not ancient but not exactly new, either. The doorknobs rattle loudly whenever someone turns them, which always leads to me trying to muffle them if my roommate is asleep so I don't wake her. On the morning in question, I heard the doorknob rattle and assumed that she'd forgotten her key or something, so I called out that the door was unlocked and she could come on in. The door opened but nobody was there. After a few seconds of realizing that she wasn't there (called her name, I got up and looked around. Nobody was out in the hallway and it was about 7:30 AM

I shrugged it off and went back to my desk with the doorway still in plain sight. Not ten seconds later

For whatever reason it didn't immediately strike me as strange and I went back to studying, in their own rooms or eating breakfast and no one said they came by, seeing as neither of us are usually awake at that time (we each had early exams that changed our schedules that morning).

I don't think it was the wind or the box fan because neither would cause the door to open after it had been shut and I highly doubt the fan is powerful enough to make the doorknob rattle and turn while the door shuts. It legitimately looked as though the door was being opened and shut by another person.

I'm sure this will get asked, just an eerie feeling of being observed by someone/thing that I couldn't see.

I've had a few creepy incidents that I'll add, like someone clapping directly near her ear. The rest of the family was upstairs and it really freaked her out, so she came up to ask if we'd been downstairs. When she got to my room, she asked me if I'd been to the kitchen recently and I said no. She hesitantly mentioned my grandpa (my dad's father) and said for some reason she thought of him. As she said this my bedroom lights flickered briefly. Granted, that could be explained by the heat coming on or going off, but it seemed like a strange coincidence. Another 'kitchen thing' happened about two months after that. I was unloading the dishwasher and stood up to feel like my head was full of static noise, like being between radio stations. It seemed like a specific spot in the kitchen because I could move away and it became faint, it went away.

One more weird thing that happened at our house... My sister and I have each separately experienced the feeling of having our bedsheets ""crawl"" up our legs. One holiday I was home from university and I slept in my old room. I woke up around 3:30 AM or so and I don't know what woke me up, no old houses or anything.

back when i was 18, a little younger than me.  
everyone liked her

so
when we reallized the hour it was well past 22 and she lived about 1 hour form there on a bus
 
when we arribe she invited me in for some more coffee and i obviously accepted.
her parents were asleep upstairs

well, a guy.  
about 60 years old

""fuck me
she turned around
i was still seeing him sitting there. i never ceased to see him.
""uh... yes there is""
now she stopped

""right there on the chair""

she looked at me for a moment like thinking and once more ""there is no one there"".

now im thinking that im getting pranked badly by her and his dad.   
""right there on the chair
she looked at me for a second and opened his eyes widely

""MOOOM"" she screamed from the top of her lungs and scared the shit out of me.   
now i dont see the guy anymore.

his mom AND his dad ran downstairs on their underwear asking what happened and pretty much looking at me with that ""WTF did you just did to my daugther mother f..."" face while i was there with my ""deer in the headlights"" face. 

""tell my mother what you just saw"" she told me and so i did.  
i told her mother how the guy looked like...and she interrupted me and finished my description.

the things calmed down, cant seem to find the right word) and got us more coffee. 

we started to talk
turned out that her was just like me
we talked for hours

i became pretty much a part of the family
it has been more than 10 years now and im still invited for a coffee now and then.

back then i was scared about the things i see and never talked to anyone thinking that i may have some sort of psicological disorder

1337281833.0,ts2kh,A shudder and boom.,butterfliesfade,18,6,0,"I used to live in this grand new two-story house in a suburbia neighborhood with quiet neighbors and a calm atmosphere. Nothing out of the ordinary never really happened. But I remember while being there

I was at least fourteen or fifteen when I lived there. My room was on the second floor, it was like at least 90F. You would instantly notice because the rest of house had a normal constant temperature and when you entered my room, there was an immediate change. I always told my parents and they could never figure out why my room was this way. The same happened for the summertime, my room would be a chilling 60F degrees and no one could figure out why. We even had a air-conditioner technican come down to take a look at it. And no one could figure out why, it was always a mystery to me.

That's not even it either. Laying in bed and trying to go to sleep at night was the hardest for me to do. There was always a nagging feeling that I had a heavy chest and countless anxiety. I couldn't look at the foot of my bed or even at my closet. Just this feeling always bothered me like someone or some people were standing there

Because of the window, and locked onto me. It felt like it was a tall man, and it looked like he had bowler hat. I knew something was there because I would resort staring to the ceiling to focus and calm down, but that never worked for me. Every single time I looked over to the foot of my bed, there was nothing there. I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, because I would feel the air change, and I felt cold wind against my face when my room was utterly hot. That's how I knew. It always felt like a soft hand swipping against my cheek

It was a brilliant and sunny day

I was upstairs in the game room, it was probably around four o'clock in the afternoon. As I paused a youtube video, I heard a weird slam. As if someone had opened my front door and slammed it. There was always this weird way you had to close my front door because it got stuck half-way while closing it. You basically had to slam it in order to close it. I knew I had the locked the door when my dad left and I knew the door had been closed for a while. How could it be possible for someone to open my lock-bolted door, when I had to have heard that heavy creak and then slam it?

My heart-rate shook up and my anxiety tumbled to the ceiling. So many thoughts run through your head when that happens

Getting up from the computer chair

My whole body was filling up with some sort of andrealine, my dog didn't sit up so I didn't hear his collar jinkle or my cat didn't meow. 

When I took one more step towards the top of my stairs to go down, it sounded like it and I was pretty convinced it was. My heart groaned against my chest, dire for some sort of escape. I even shook myself because I didn't know if I could think anymore. I have never heard a gunshot before but I was sure it was, and my neighborhood was a good one I don't think they could of been a shooting. Then a loud frantic crying and moaning came out of nowhere it was like someone was right next to me doing this. It lasted for about a few ten seconds, but it was chilling. It sounded like a lady, a damsel in terrible distress. A sense of hopefulness and despair washed over me, it was as if she could envelope me with her emotions. I could feel the breath of something on the back of my ear. My eyes narrowed from side to side back and forth. My whole existence went numb as I didn't know what to think. 

I didn't know what to do, forgetting everything else outside of it.

The only thing I can piece together is that the man with the bowler hat that watched me at night killed this woman with a gunshot. The woman was pleading at me to protect her that's why she was standing beside me. I'm not able to research the land or know how to but I do know what I experienced was real. My parents don't believe me but some of my friends do because they have been at my old house.

1336442497.0,tc7wr,[ME/FAM] The Former Resident,LemoLuke,13,1,6,"I am about to share possibly the only event in my life that I cannot satisfactorily explain. I try and look at everything from a skeptical, this is the only one I have difficulty coming up with a rational explanation for.

Back when I was about 12 - 13 (I'm 29 now), my Nan was quite healthy, and of sound mind, so she would only stay there at night, and would spend the days at my mothers house, which was only a couple of streets away.

During these times, watch TV, or take my games console, where I could enjoy the peace and quiet. However, I always got a strange feeling from the flat, although I'm not sure if this is simply from years of watching horror films and reading books on the paranormal.

However, both her and my mum had been at the flat all evening, having a little bit of a drink, and listening to old records and chatting about everything. When I got there, the flat was a little untidy. Records had been scattered around the record player, some peanuts had been spilt on the table, and some blankets were on the sofa, my mum decided to go home, was only separated from the living room by a curtain.

The next morning, who I could see, even in the low light (It was January, so it was still dark at that time) was pale and visibly scared.

My nan had gotten up and walked into the living room, opened the passageway door, and switched on the light in there, giving her enough light to sit down and smoke a cigarette. It was at this point that she realized the the flat was suddenly tidy. The records had been stacked neatly, the peanuts had been put into the ashtray, and the blankets from the sofa were nowhere to be seen (I used separate blankets and had left those ones where they were). Shocked, my nan turned to the passageway, and her eyesight is really bad without them

Now, and I could see the shock on her face. The final straw came later that day. She was chatting to one of her neighbors when she described the encounter. The neighbor told her that the woman she had described sounded like the former resident who had died the previous year.

My nan moved out of the flat that very same day and never went back.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/tc7wr/mefam_the_former_resident/

Finding old relics of the Native American population was relatively common, but because it was freaking weird and feels incomplete to leave out: 

In the middle of a beautiful spring day

I looked up to see a beautiful and large grey wolf lift its head to stare back at me not 50 yards away. Nervous

I had some adrenalin going at this point, even heartbeat. 

I looked towards the neighbors’ house on the left to see if they were just listening to music

Shaking it off, just as loud as before.

1331870602.0,qyx3t,Firehouse Tales,shakingspear,16,4,2,"So I saw the post earlier about the creepiest thing you've ever seen

A lot of stuff happened in the firehouse over a two or three month time frame. When all of this stuff happened

1. Three of us were hanging out in the meeting room when we heard an old woman say ""Hello?"" three times. The first time she said it I thought it was the scanner

2. The meeting room had a pool table. My friend and I decided to have a 101 game tournament to decide who was the better player. We would play for an hour or two every day after school. One day, as we continued whatever conversation we were having. I stood near the switch as we continued to talk, when from the garage we heard a woman scream her head off. We ran out of the firehouse at full speed. That was one of the first things that I experienced, if not the first. 

3. There was a woman at the firehouse that hated me and my friends because we were young and hung out there a lot. She would have been a great arch-nemesis, but a few times a week. A couple of us used to joke that we should hide our cars, and then hide in the firehouse and scare the shit out of her. 
One day I went to the firehouse with a friend who wasn't a firefighter. As we were walking toward the building, waiting for someone to jump out at me and try to scare me. It was an hour before I let me guard down. No one was in the place.

4. *A lot* of shit happened in this place. It used to take me up to 45 minutes to go through all of the shit that happened when telling someone else. Near the back of the garage was a supply closet that was locked. We used to hang out near there and smoke cigarettes when in the firehouse. Two brothers from a different fire company were hanging out with me and someone else one night, who laughed at most of what we said, started walking toward the front of the garage. The other was sitting on the back of one of the trucks. As I continued to say, ""I swear this is true,"" or something along those lines, a loud noise came from the locked closet. The walking dude stopped dead in his tracks, the guy on the truck turned white, ""I told you mother fuckers!"" Since we were there all of the time, just like it always is.

I'm sorry this was so long. You're lucky I don't recall too many more right now. Though there is one more story:

On the other side of the locked supply closet was a small room where we kept a bunch of tools. There were 7 or 8 of us hanging out near there one night. As in story 4, I looked over my shoulder and saw my one friend in the Karate Kid crane position. He looked over his shoulder, realized he was by himself and then ran away. 

After we stopped laughing about it we went back to the door

1329786761.0,pym6t,[ME] Hometown Stories Part 1: The Girl at the Beach [X-POST from /r/nosleep],Jables19,21,9,9,"When you live in a small town and you are under 21 like I was in this story

Centennial Beach was less a beach than it was a small sandy area on the border of Lake Williams. To get there you had to drive into an area of town called Fort Meadow. It was a nice neighborhood away from the general shadiness of the rest of the town. As often as we had the idea to go to the beach late at night the execution could be a little tricky.

The parking lot was closed off after about 6:00 p.m. in the summer so you couldn't just drive down into the parking lot. You had to park down the road so passing police wouldn't see several cars parked at the entrance. Then you had to walk in the dark

I tell you this to give you a sense of the isolation we felt when we hung out there. We would swim, Dan, Matt, Jaime, Heather, Chris, Liz

I can't remember who saw it first but soon we all watched as a flashlight was coming toward us from the woods at the side of the beach. Immediately we assumed it was a police officer coming to tell us to get out of there. It had happened before and while we didn't get in any trouble we would still be bummed that we had to leave. But there was something off about the flashlight. It wasn't held rigidly as an officer would

""What the fuck are you doing here?"" Her tone was accusatory as though she found us squatting under her porch. We didn't know how to react. We were a little shocked that this smaller girl had come up to a group of strangers and started cussing us out. I broke away from the group toward the girl. I figured I was pretty cordial and could at least try to diffuse her suspicion. As I stepped toward her she began to step back while her body took on a defensive rigidity.

She asked

She was one girl, he asks someone to chain him up for the night to keep the population safe. She had the same energy coming off of her. Within a couple minutes she had dropped the giant metal flashlight to her side and began to tell me how she lived on the beach and that we shouldn't be there. It was almost as if she was trying to clear us out for our own good.

Then the whole group decided to come over to us at the same time. Any comfort that I had had been cultivating disappeared in an instant. She began to rear back again as my friends approached. Poor Liz, ""Is the little princess getting scared?""

Liz let out a whimper and Kevin pulled her closer. My friend Dan, ""wow, this girl is fucking weird!"" Meanwhile I am still the middle ground between the two. On one side of me I have my friends who are growing more uncomfortable and I have this strange girl who for some reason is comfortable with me but doesn't like the whole group. I barely noticed when she began to circle around me. To lighten the mood my friend Matt told Jaime to do his hilarious ""chicken dance"". To this day, I haven't seen it because right when Matt made his request the stranger shouted, ""I'll show you a chicken dance!"" She took her long metal flash light and made a huge overhead swing at Matt's skull. He barely dodged it and screamed, ""Holy Shit!"" The whole group took off running toward the dark trees and back to the cars...and she took off after them

I, I'm a fat guy, and the last time I checked insane beats terrified in a foot race. So, I walked. I walked toward the parking lot and watched my friends disappear into the darkness while being chased by some lunatic that would probably turn around and realize that I was an easy target. I could hear my friends screaming for me to hurry up, run, go, go, shining her flashlight into the branches above

I began to hustle up the driveway when I heard one final message from the stranger.

""Nice to meet you

   They leave, that has a door opposite the mens room that leads upstairs. While in there, I hear the door close the some footsteps toward the bathroom door. No knock, just heavy breathing. I'm creeped out but it stopped quickly and I heard footsteps leading away.

   I walk back out to the lab and give the ""anyone there"" shout out....no answer. At this point I get the feeling that I need to leave. I don't know why, comes a horrible, female scream. I jump and spin around, I see a glimps of a shadowy figure heading towards me and I sprint up two flights of stairs to get out.

My mom used to work early weekday mornings and leave the house by 5:30AM leaving me alone to get dressed and take off for school. She used to leave me breakfest and a drink on a bannister that I could see just peeking outside my door. This particular morning something woke me up early as the sun was setting to a noise...I look out the door and I can hear the sound of liquid pouring into the cup i'm looking at but I don't see anything. I watch, for about 5 secs, then the sound of the house shaking but the house is not shaking, then a blast of hot air comes over me. I proceed to slip into the electric boogie of fear and panic as i'm stuck in my room with no other exit but that door the sound is coming from. I do the only thing I can do and put the covers over my head and wait...finally getting the bravery to come out...when it happens again in the exact same order....to cut the story short I had to call a neighbor friend of mine to come over and ran like a mach5 out to room to the door downstairs to get him in there. I never set foot in that house again alone for years. My mother had gone to two psychics just for fun within a year of that incident and both confirmed independently without her saying anything that I had experienced something and it had something to do with my guardian angel so don't be afraid (yeah right). The funny thing is the only reason people have not believed this story is because I was watching the damn Beetlejuice cartoon that morning but it had absolutely nothing to do with it.

My first premonition that I recall was when I was six. In my dream

I told my mother about my dream late that next afternoon, and I felt bad for so disappointing the kind old lady by not recognizing her.

When I was 12, I let go and tried to swim ashore, but he continued to struggle and eventually drowned.

The next day my fake Uncle, the local swimming spot. We went, but I felt sick and detached the whole time. When we got home, there was a hole in the yard and Barney was dead, laying on an old shirt of my mom's.

Barney had choked on a piece of rawhide he stole from our new puppy.

At fifteen, admitting I loved him (which was a surprise to me even as the words tumbled out of my mouth). I don't think the dream meant romantic love, though when he responded ""You should have told me sooner. It's the end of the semester; it's too late."" I kissed him. Then I was pulled back to my room and woke up chilled in bed with a brief moment of sleep paralysis.

Three days later

I hadn't really known much about his personal life. It turned out he had never been kissed

After that incident I must admit I did repeated ""trips"" on [Dramamine](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Dimenhydrinate.shtml). However, I'd get dizzy, and then I'd start dreaming, while still feeling fully conscious. It was very strange. I described it to doctors as both a hallucination and a dream, but they had no answers about either. 

I started going to the nurse's office during school when I felt a spell coming on. I said I had headaches, what ever it took. Then I'd go collapse into these strange waking dreams, awaking over and over in sleep paralysis. At first, I just became conscious, eyes closed, unable to move, able to hear and feel.

Then I started waking up, in horrible pain. I'd be able to see all around myself in perfect clarity, something I'm unused to thanks to glasses. Sometimes I'd watch the goings on in the room, but I couldn't untangle myself, sometimes couldn't move at all, then I'd snap back into my physical body and find it laying in a perfectly comfortable position.

Every time I had a spell during Physics or Early Civilizations, the teacher, and my classmates, heard the discussions. It was insane.

I started smoking weed and it ties me to my physical body pretty well. But when I haven't smoked in a while

Sleep paralysis is caused by the continued presence of a neurotransmitter that paralyzes the body during sleep

I guess something in me could always access the astral plane

I do, because I always lucid dream. The symbolism is intense and the dreams feel more real and important than reality. So I started smoking weed heavily, like I said, in part because it's supposed to help with regulating sleep. 

I also play soundtracks (wordless) or ""holographic sound"" nature recordings. When I awake

Oh yeah. I have control over my dreams (I have thoughts and decision making and some manipulation of the environment) but there are other entities which have equal power to I. Often my own personal demons and goblins and other villains from fantasy, it gradually becomes isolated until it is all that I see... It pursues me into the blackness of consciousness before waking and flashes over and over again in my vision, reaching out to grab me... But this never happens with a real person in a dream like this. I can leave them.

When I manage to escape from whatever is holding me, sometimes the whole campus, sometimes the world -- very strange and saddening when I can see the world. Sometimes people come to me and beg me for help but I just have to forget about them, I can't do anything for them, I can barely help myself...

I'm meditating and trying to take control over my life

Am I going insane? Or am I seeing the light?  Is there a difference? Why am I able to ask myself this question

What else is there?

Oh yes, and when it landed around my neck beneath my Quartz it produced a great dizzying flash of gold light and three of my relatives said “those look great together!” at the same time. I physically cannot wear the amber without the quartz as I get an intense cold sensation where the quartz usually rests. 

I wear those two necklaces every day these days, and often lose it after I use up it’s energy...

I used to wear a bloodstone, set in gold. I lost all of them. I used to love my rough, ’practice-made’ flower ring, highly flawed emeralds and rubies set in silver. I still have it but cannot wear it, it just doesn't meld to my body. I have a solid silver ring with my name carved into it that has a similar property to it. I can't wear it any more.

I promise that what I am saying really happened. These, started, even after we moved. This all mostly happened when I was younger. I was around 4. We lived in a tiny house. Only 2 bed-rooms. The only bathroom was in the main bedroom and it could only be accessed through the kitchen. This is a major part to this. The first experience involved my mom. At the time, she and my step-dad did not have a bed in their room so they were using the pull-out bed in the couch as a place to lay their heads at night. This particular night, my mom was lying under a blanket covered from her neck down to her feet, meaning that she was warm (at the time, she was a very warm-natured person

A while later, and they looked like a tall man holding the hand of a small girl.

Even later than that, and it was raining heavily, so there was mud in front of the house (probably should have mentioned that it was nothing but dirt in front of the house then the porch), but there was no footprints so no one came and hit the door really hard.

After this, according to her. After a few seconds, it was like whoever it was that was beside her jumped and stomped as loud as they could. Mom said they left that house have haven't looked back.

That was just the first of our family's dealings with the supernatural stuffs. The middle school that I attended had someone die in the auditorium. It seemed like every time I walked by, meaning that no one should have been in there. That happened with not only me, but a lot of other people.

The weirdest/scariest thing I have ever dealt with is stuff in my current house falling (before we got the cat). I was home by myself when I heard loud noises coming from the back of the house. At first, which is a newer addition (I live in an old mill house and the back part of the house was added later, which includes my room, the laundry room, and the bathroom). I told no one for fear of looking like a crazy person.

It just so happened that last night, but a skeletal figure, around the back end of the house, near my room. I am a very spiritual person, but also acknowledge that there are things that even religion can't explain. Since these happenings, I have kept rose quartz, amethyst, along with a few new added gems I recently received. I also have my class ring with my birthstone (sapphire) in it that is said in the Wiccan tradition (keep in mind I am christian but acknowledge the possibility/probability that crystals and gemstones really do have the powers that have been associated with them) to protect against spiritual attacks and to help boost the inner third eye.

couch naps are awesome.  What's even better

Commence carefree snoozing.

I sleep a tremendous sleep, its seems nearly impossible to open my eyes and it feels like they're rolling back in my head.  I try to move my arms, but nothing happens.  I think to myself, ""self, this is sleep paralysis""  which I've experienced about 3 times before.  

But then, behind the armrest of the couch.  I can hear  breathing.  Then a soft, drawn out whisper of the word ""Belial"" is spoken from behind my head. 

Confused? 
You bet.

Now, behind the armrest.  I don't see a thing.  I walk upstairs, look out at the driveway and only see my car.  No one is home.  

I think the whole thing over in my head and chalk it up to sleep paralysis, and I ended up spelling the word correctly- only it's not a word, it's the name of a demon.  'Belial' is a demon in the catholic and jewish religion.  I'm sort of a roman catholic and this is pretty terrifying right about now.

I was driving home from work on a night that was darker than usual because of oncoming rain. I had my friend on the line just to shoot the shit. A car passed me on the highway and I caught a reflection of something in my own windshield. It was a pair of eyes. Similar to my own but lacking glasses and arranged in a way that they could have accompanied a scowl.

Understandably

I figured that if I kept my friend on the line
""Just stay on the buddy. I can't tell you why. Just stay on the line.""

At this point, or collected. But again, I divert your attention to the lunatic in my car and hope you understand. I drove about another eight minutes until I got to a well lit has station with a load of people on it. I pulled in. Stopped the car. And jumped the fuck out. As one does.

As people looked at me from across the gas station, no damage done. I'm sure I wasn't the first crazy person everyone stared at in the gas station that day.

A few nights later I had mostly forgotten about the last experience. That is

I made as close to as what I felt was eye contact with ""him"" through the mirror and essentially said that I didn't mind if he or any of his buddies just wanted to chill or grab a ride

A few nights later, I heard a raspy voice whisper my name. I listened for more, but didn't hear anything.

Initially when we moved in, *weird*. Not everyone had experiences like I said, and only 2 of the other house mates were willing to actually share theirs, the third was very put off by it, and refused to believe there was a ghost, or other entity.

The 3 bedrooms were shared by 2 people each, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of footsteps in my room. My roommate hadn't moved in yet, and wouldn't for a few days. At first I was a little freaked out, and laid still, listening to the sound of the steps go around my bed, from one side to the other. After only a few moments, I sat up, but I was still a little bothered. This ended up happening on several nights in my room.

Moving forward, when I sat down with E and S to ask them if they noticed anything happening in the house. E and S shared a room. They told me that they had been hearing footsteps coming from my room late at night, and that their door handle rattles at night. They always kept their door locked at night, and were romantically involved, so locking their door wasn't unusual.

Myself, or going to work late at night/early morning, generally when everyone else was asleep, or up in their rooms. Whenever I left for work in the early mornings, typically before the sun was up. I was always certain I kept seeing someone walk throughout the lower part of the house. I hadn't noticed it at first, but it was becoming a glaring realization that I was seeing an entity move about. I decided to ask E to see if he had been having the same odd feelings, and he confirmed

As far as the previous events had gone, so that I could bolt downstairs in the mornings, what brought the events to a head occurred in the following weeks.

We decided to have a house meeting regarding the events. During the meeting, only to slam shut before he touched it. After telling us about it, he started denying it happened. I'm assuming he might have been messing with us. At the end of our meeting though, we sat down and had a few beers, talking about normal happenings in our lives. During this talk though, we hear footsteps upstairs in the house, while we're still all gathered in the living room. The steps were heavy, and continued on for several minutes before stopping. Things were calm for a few days after that.

Fast forward again, the only person in the house. I go upstairs, take a shower, and as I exit the bedroom, I hear a door slam shut downstairs. I go downstairs to see who just got home, and everything in the house has been tossed onto the floor. The closets and cabinets all opened through the house, and just rummaged through

Going forward another length of time, and I noticed a weird black shape by the bathroom door. I slid the door open, and it was gone, I wasn't able to create the visual representation again. After my shower though, something slams on the bathroom door, and I bolt downstairs as soon as I'm dressed. In panic, S comes upstairs, heads upstairs to see what the noise is.

For 5 years I rarely slept without a light on, and eventually I refused to go up there alone. 

When I did turn the light out to sleep I would hear a noise like something being rolled across the floorboards in my room. As soon as I flicked the bedside light on the noise would stop. After a few months I began listening to my CD player at night to drown out the rolling noise. I would wake up in the morning to find the ear buds of my headphones had been cut off - my mother said it was probably field mice

There was a door at the bottom of the stairs with a gap at the top, as if someone was sat watching me, I couldn’t be in this room after dark. Whilst playing in the garden I again would find myself looking at certain windows as if someone was there watching. Being alone in the house babysitting my very young sister was a terrifying experience - I always felt someone was in there with me and always watching.

There would be other things like foot steps distinctly heard as if on floorboards when the rooms were carpeted, ornaments facing the wrong way on a shelf, fire guards rattling etc. At this point, despite being a fan of ghost stories I hadn’t realised we were dealing with a Poltergeist. 

One day in 2000 I was sitting in my room reading a book when I heard a thud. I looked up to find a pile of books that had been on top of my bookcase were now on the floor, tap, tap...” noise and looked up to find a pile of cassette tapes moving one at a time off the top of a speaker and re-stacking on the floor. I couldn’t handle things moving on their own so fled the room to find my mum. I sat down in the kitchen apparently looking terrified and recounted my experience. She admitted we had a ghost, and she had hidden that knowledge from me in an attempt to prevent me being scared. As she was explaining what was going on there was an almighty smash from the far end of the house and we discovered a very large gilt framed antique mirror had been thrown 18ft across a room and smashed. 

From this point things intensified; more noise, radios turning up and down on their own. At one point I became so depressed through the emotional stress that I attempted suicide and had a nervous breakdown during my last year of school. My mum experienced a lot of things as well but won’t talk about it much, she would regularly hear someone close the front door, walk upstairs and towards my parents bedroom but no one would appear.  

Eventually we had to get the local priest in to bless the house. My mum was sure the ghost passed over through her. One evening a few weeks after the priest had been,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,,t3_1iidjr

There was one about finding a key

There was also a dream around the time of the boxing day tsunami that i won't go into out of respect. I go to type it out and it just feels wrong.

It all could have been coincidence - it wasn't every single dream I had that had some relevance. There was no real way of telling other than a hunch. But it happened often enough to convince me.
But it's not happened in years now. I'm paranoid about a nightmare from the other night but I doubt anything will come of it. I may have been reading too much nosleep.

But my story is something different.

As I said

[The layout of this house is as follow](http://i.imgur.com/PyvFRgG.gif)

There was a room that always scared me because it was dark (mainly due to its dark red curtains my mom placed there
But also due to a strange vibe that i felt in that room.

My family never felt a vibe in that room. 
My sisters and me used to dub it  ""Het laatste kamer"" (the final/last room)

This room was a hobby room for my dad. 
He would spend hours in there (experiencing absolutely nothing).
He was also a goldsmith
At chest hight there was a plank with all thé goldsmith stuff.


I used to sleep next to my younger sisters room for years growing up

I refused to go in that room but got told I didn't have no choice in this matter.

They said that I can go spend a few nights in that room to get used to it.

The first few nights nothing happened

The third night in that room
Being the light sleeper

I was scared by this but I shrugged it off

All off thé sudden

I didn't respond to this

The third time something put its nails in my eyelids pulling my eyes open.

When my eyes opened I saw a woman (not my mother or either of my sisters

Startled I said ""Hello, in a strange and friendly but creepy way like a psycho serial killer.

This was followed by an instant grab to the throat

And she grabbed my nose to instantly causing me to suffocate.

While she was suffocatie me


Out of all coincedences

I tried to call for my dad but I couldn't.

When he got out of the toilet

I was very lucky that my dad heard me because almost no sound came out of my mouth.

My dad was standing in the doorway, but he was really sleepy.

So he asked ""What's wrong?"" 

Then I said ""Help!""


The whore that was grabbing my throat looked up at the door
My dad didn't raise his and to the door to shut it, she just looked at it.

When the door shut

There was nothing physical blocking this door


When my dad finally managed to open the door

When I explained everything to them they didn't want to believe me. 

Later on they believed me because a priest confirmed everything I experienced.



Months went by and nothing happened again

I remember going to the toilet one day (afternoon) and the door to the final room being closed.

When I was done with my toilet business

This door opened and I saw the same whore standing in the doorway

I took a few steps closer because she gave me a (false) sense of safety.

When all off the sudden, VERY EVIL"".

Then the whore said in a more angry and annoyed way ""COME OVER HERE"" and she even pullen her demon face.

Then the thing inside me said ""TELL HER YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD AND TELL HER TO LEAVE YOU ALONE"" 

Which I did

And then I tried running away from her.

I was almost at my parents room

I quickly turned around while being dragged across the floor and I saw that whore still standing in the doorway having an very eerie and evil smile.
When I turned around I saw nobody dragging me.


I screamed for my mother and this woman disappeard in the room.

1365660154.0,1c4bo1,the tall man,dracula_black,25,14,19,Greetings. This is the first time I have posted on this sight. Although for several weeks now I have been very much addicted to reading other peoples encounters and stories. Without further adiue I shall present one of my own encounters. . . I shall here encourage the reader to light up a cigarette or pour a stiff drink and hopefully enjoy my words....  first off I shall start by saying that I had many encounters in the house I grew up in which was built in 1839. If this post goes well and there is interest I shall post more. I decided to start with one of the more shocking enounters I have had. . .to set the scene it was the fall of 2007 which was a good year I shall. Add. Neevertheless it was late one night I had decided to lay down in the spare bedroom. I shall note that many strange things occured in this room. I closed my eyes for a moment as I layed on the bed in the darkness. As I layed there I suddenly became aware of a feeling asthough someone had entered the room. I opened my eyes and was someone surprized to see that the bedroom door which had previously been closed was now ajar. I had fluffed it off as being one of the three cats that we had perhaps entering the room yet I could not shake the strange feeling that I was being watched. I looked away from the open door and to the foot of the bed. At the foot of the bed I saw something that will forever be ingrained on my mind. I saw a looming figure gazing down upon me. I immediatly screamed. The figure lingered for probably about 10 seconds before just fading preditor like into the darkness of the room. I jumped up and ran out of the room. It was definitly the clearest look at an apparition I had ever had. It stood 8 ft. I know this because the ceiling in the room was just over 8 ft and the figures head was at the height of the ceiling or just below it. The width of the figure was easily as wide as a standard refrigerator. It appeared to be wearing what at the time reminded me of an ebeneezer style nightgown. Strange as it sounds that's the best description I can give it. The type of nightgown a man may have worn back in earlier times. The head was bald and white. The ears were sharp. The face demonic in appearance for lack of a better term. If I had to liken it to anything I would say it had the appearance of nosferatu from the 1922 film of the same name. Anyway so that's what I saw I didn't sleep or step foot in the spare room for weeks. I had then and have now chills all over my body just thinking about it. Another strange aspect of this story is that afew days later I recived validation of sorts. I had came home late from band practice and stood in the doorway to the kitchen and called out to my grandma whom I lived with at the time to bid her goodnight. The next morning she asked me who my friend was? I was confused by this as I had came home alone the previous night. She said that when I told her goodnight from the kitchen there had been an extreemly tall man standing directly behind me! That's one of many strange occurance I have had. It remains a complete mystery to me as to what this entity could have been. Has anyone else encountered anything like this? Or have any idea what this could have been? The ghost of christmas past? It seems like in my memory I have heard about giant ghosts before somewhere but could be wrong. Any speculation would be appreciated. ,t5_2sntx,True

Around two or three years ago, and so I was prepared. The inside was rather small, not much to look at, nothing really. But the kid's room, wow. There were toys, Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and even a broken old playstation on the floor. We also found a journal. I swear there were two when we got there, just stupid kid stuff with some drawings. We left that place with no problem. Skip forward a year or two...  
I decided to stop by again with a completely different friend who hadn't been there before. Being a ballsy dumb 16 year old, we heard something, like a metal clang. We tried to ignore it, and when I returned home I put a bible on top of the journal, just to be safe.  
That summer, and clouds darkened the sky. In a few minutes the wind got so powerful, pushing us in the complete opposite direction of our destination. We had to yell at each other, to return back. When we got back, the wind had calmed down, but my backyard was wide open, and my dog was running around the front yard. We got him back in the backyard and went inside, and maybe it was all just a really big coincidence. I don't know.  
Around November I went back there again, yes, but I was too terrified to care. We went around 8 on a Friday night, I believe it was. It was so dark outside.

1364282900.0,1b13hr,Some of the creepiest experiences I have ever had,annihilatrix322,11,0,3,"OK sorry for the lengthy post

The first night we ever experienced anything my parents were out and I was home with my younger brother and sister. We were in the family room watching tv when we heard the door leading to our garage start to make strange noises. The handle started to turn back and forth quickly as if the door was locked and someone was trying to open it. My brother, like someone was grabbing the door handle from the other side and jerking the door back and forth as hard as they could. I figured that maybe my dad had a bad day or something and came home to find the door locked and became frustrated and was trying to get in. I got off the couch and walked into the laundry room to go open the door and noticed the door was unlocked. I opened the door to find complete darkness and when I turned on the light I was just staring into a completely empty garage, no cars, no one was home. I remember turning on the light and just standing in the doorway staring into the garage and immediately feeling horrified. To me the creepiest thing is all three of us heard the door, it wasn’t just me, or just my brother or sister. All of us heard it.

I was pretty much always the last person to go to bed in my house, and he always assumed it was me walking around. After that night both my dad and I would still hear the footsteps after I went to my room. Most nights I would go to bed and lay down and just wait and listen and then I would hear footsteps walking down the hall and then I would hear my parents door open and my dad step out checking to see who was out there. He never saw anything.

The creepiest thing I ever experienced in that house happened when we were moving out. Telling this story still gives me goose bumps all over my arms. One night as we were moving my dad asked me to go back to the house and grab a tv cable he had left in his bedroom. I agreed to go. By the time I got to the house it was pretty late at night. I walked into the house and it was freezing which was weird because it was fairly warm outside. I walked into my parents room and as I walked in I flung the door closed behind me. I find the cable still connected to the wall and start unscrewing it. At that moment I start hearing footsteps walking around upstairs at a fairly fast pace. As I pull the chord out of the wall and get up ready to go investigate the footsteps turn into an all out run that goes from my old room, hit the hardwood floor at the bottom, then run down the downstairs hallway and stop right outside the door of my parents room. I sat there staring at the door waiting for it to open for a couple seconds and then I slowly walked to the door and open it. Nothing. Nobody standing there, no other noises just nothing. Completely consumed by fear I walked out of the room to the front door and walked out of the house and I never set foot in there again.

1363482692.0,1afulc,[FAM] A story my grandma shared with me ,DesiDaku,18,7,5,"This is a story my grandma told me a long time ago when I was visiting my family in India. She recently visited us here in Cali and I asked her to tell me stories like she used to when I was a little. She told me the exact same story in the exact same words she used so long ago
- 1950s maybe? Sorry for length.

Here is some background info. This is my family on my mothers side, my family owns one of the bigger houses and a pretty prosperous farm there. There were no streetlight back then and it was basically a farming town. 

Anyways, well India haha. Anyways, it was getting late and the dude who usually took care of the farm was out sick. Most of the farm work had been completed, except for an outlying farm that made a little money on the side for my family. 

But before I can continue this story

The outlying farm a few decades ago or so used to be owned by two brothers. One of them was particularly identified by his broken, and pretty much ganked him when Broken-Tooth had a particularly good harvest. Anyways, it was pretty much a local legend that Broken-Tooth's pissed off spirit haunted the farm in the early hours of morning and night. 

The farm my grandpa was headed.

So picture this scene. There's no light but the dim light held by my grandpa sitting in a big tractor chuggin down an empty dirt road a couple miles away from town

The man is dark, proclaiming that he is Broken-Tooth. My grandpa turns the tractor around and goes as fast as he can home. He is cold and shivering and my grandma remembers him being incredibly scared and frightened. 


My mom doesn't believe this story
She's never met a ghost

 A few things happened off and on, but was expected to make a full recovery and go home.  One night, before I was asleep, I heard my uncle's voice say, ""Grandpa will be coming home soon.""  Instinctively, I knew he didn't mean home with my grandmother.  I told my mother the following morning.  He died a week later.  


There was also a woman whose shop my mother and I used to visit. We hadn't been in a while, I wonder how so-and-so is? We saw her obituary within a few days.


Finally, trying to help a man that was having a heart attack. I couldn't. This took place on a Saturday night. The next day (Sunday) I was at church (which faces the street the house was on) and I saw ambulances at the house I had dreamed I was in. Monday, I asked a guy in one of my classes who lived on that street what had happened. He said the man had had a heart attack. I said ""weird"". He asked why, so I told him about my dream. He asked if the man lived or not. I said no. The guy died on Wednesday.

All of this (except for knowing about the baby who died) could possibly be coincidence. I understand that. But the experience that affected me the most follows:

Let me preface by saying that anyone who knows me

My grandmother (my mom’s aunt who raised her) died. We were trying to figure out what to do with her house. She had left half to her surviving siblings, even when alone. (After her death, I frequently went there to study). One night, I was studying and had just decided to pack up and go home. It was after dark, but that was nothing unusual for me. Suddenly, I had this immense terror. I KNEW without a doubt that something evil was in the house with me. I sensed it at one end of the living room, towards the bedrooms. I packed up as quickly as I could, who art in heaven” (that was all I could remember, I would literally lose my mind. I got to my car in the garage and was waiting for the door to go up enough for me to leave. The fear was so tangible I truly expected to see something look out the window panes on the door at me.
The whole way home

 Whatever was in that house, trying to get into my mind. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it. The only way I could get it to go away was to imagine the house surrounded by angels armed with swords, willing to protect me and my family. I told my mother at some point, and she suggested maybe it was a sign we weren’t supposed to buy the house.
My biological grandmother (my mother’s actual birth mother) came down for the funeral. (I think this was before my experience because I can’t imagine sleeping there after that). She came into the room I was sleeping in
After telling my mother about this

My biological grandmother (the one who heard the footsteps) has had several experiences too

1353786316.0,13q4bg,[ME] My Grandpa coming to visit me? Or something else....,steampunker13,12,3,5,"So a few years back, but what happened to me was totally new and I was totally unprepared for it.

One night, said goodnight to everyone, and I went to sleep. At about one o'clock, I was woken up by a strange knock coming from the attic. The attic is right next to my room, but I dismissed it as the house settling because of the length of time between the knocks. I was into the paranormal then, so I was freaked out.

Night two was worse. The knocks were louder. I was definitely scared this time. I was awake for about twenty minutes before the knocks stopped. I didn't sleep well that night. I asked my sister if she had heard the noises in the morning. She told me she didn't know what she was talking about. The next few days were hell. The knocks continued and I swear I heard the attic door opening. One night, like something was pushing it into my mind. 

The final night was the worst. I went to bed, I summoned all my courage, and looked up. There was nothing in the hallway, but I felt as if someone was watching me. After I rested my head, the noises continued shortly after. They were so close in length intervals that I dismissed it as regular creeks.

For backround, early as hell. My younger brother and I had stayed up particularly late (or what my 12 year old self deemed late at the time) and, he being an early riser regardless of how much sleep he got, I had politely warned him that if he woke me up early (as was his wont) that I would beat the crap out of him.

So, the knock. Three taps, both times. The third time I heard the tripple rapping, I was starting to come to. I grumbled to my brother to leave me the hell alone. Three more knocks answered me. Awakening more, I told my brother that I would kick his ass if he didn't go away. In response I heard three more knocks.

It was at this point that I came out of my sleepy state and recalled that I did not have a door. My brother and I had torn it up while jacking around and, and thus lack privacy, for a month. Coming to that realisation, I opened my eyes. At that moment came three more knocks.

I have terrible eyesight but my hearing makes up for it in subtle ways. I pinned down the source of the repeated rapping using a crude form of echolocation. It was coming from direcly in front of me, confirming my echolocation, except I still could not see anything.

Up until that point, just out of eyesight. At that point, irrational hope set in that the squeaking would creak around my bed and there would be my brother. I would beat the life out of him but we would later have a good laugh.

When the creaking crept around my bed into my sight range and there was nothing there, I snapped.

I threw the comfortor over my head and began praying to God (I was a devout Christian at the time) to protect me. The squeaks kept coming. When the noise was even with my head, my ear popped and the numbness vanished. Then, the sound creaked out of my wall (an experience as odd as it sounds) and I was left alone with my mumbled prayers.

Eventually

During it all

Before you suggest sleep paralysis (as it was the number one such explantion from r/Paranormal), I was also readily capable of throwing my covers over my head.  The only point at which I was paralysed was when the being crept around the corner, continuing to make sound without my being able to see it when I should have.

I have a friend who tells classic bs stories and fools around with people's gullibility

 When I was told all of this I got incredibly scared

1.1 - Preface
Before my friend ""Mark"" was born, but they may make certain entities mad, or interested in certain people).  The story specifics are a little hazy for this bit but the essence is that the board sent some pretty suggestive messages to the Aunty.  It's important to note that this family has No link to religion and are the stereotypical hard working hard drinking heavy music sort of people.  Although I don't know what happened to her, over the next couple of weeks she had a lot of supernatural experiences and after two weeks was forced into an asylum, diagnosed with developing schizophrenia.  After she got out she was baptized and is now a born again Christian, visiting church every Sunday. 

TL;DR: Aunt develops schizophrenia from undefined supernatural experiences and tries to repent them by becoming devoutly religious.

1.2
Several years later, which had a large window covering the entire wall, showing the moon.  Mark woke up in the middle of the night and sat up to see if anybody was awake.  At the end of the room he saw a set of glowing eyes and could hear a faint ""evil laugh"".  At first he couldn't move or talk and was almost in a state of paralysis.  As the thing move past the window there was full definition of a thin but muscular dark red body, hunched over with a skin appearing to have a scaly texture.  Mark said it had the classic tail and horns of a demon.  It kept eye contact for the whole event, and started slowly walking toward Mark's end of the room, the laugh growing louder.  Only a few seconds after it appeared the 'paralysis' broke and Mark started screaming and shaking his Aunty to wake up but she was dead asleep.  The demon kept getting closer and closer to Mark but as soon as it got about a meter from the foot of the bed it just vanished.  Mark's Aunty woke up to him screaming and sobbing and assuming he was just having nightmares comforted him back to sleep.  In the morning he was trying to describe it to his family and did so by drawing a picture of a demon.  His mum and Dad did the sort of ""awh shit"" thing like they were experienced with it but blew it off for Mark's sake.  Apparently this is exactly what his Aunty had been exposed to which caused her schizophrenia. Even though everybody tried to keep their cool after Mark did his drawing the Aunty burst into tears and broke down.  He tries to dismiss it as a nightmare or a hallucination but he had never seen images or themes of the devil or demons and with the family history it's kind of hard to dismiss.

TL;DR: the demon who stalked Mark's Aunty came back for Mark

2.1
All the ones in 2 should be really short.  Mark is the oldest of three sons, you've seen that too?"".  Mark (12ish) got them each to tell him what they had seen individually to make sure they weren't lying and the stories matched up with every detail he could ask.  Apparently throughout the night shadows of between 1 and 3 people would appear through the night, and just stand around as if they were having a conversation, signaling the top bunk by pointing or whatever.  After a while they would crawl across the wall, onto the roof and disappear over Mark's bunk.

2.2
In the same house, or breathe.  I know this is easily explained sleep paralysis sort of thing but I thought it'd be worth adding as another unusual event in this house, as the house itself seemed to be carrying some weird stuff.

2.3
One night Mark's uncle who is a boxer and his girlfriend were staying over at the house.  The house is two story and has a punching bag hanging on the first floor and when you really get into it the whole house can shake around.  That night the whole house was shaking like when somebody's using the punching bag

1338821146.0,uk8tg,[ME] Looking for input on a life long experience thus far (lengthy read),thisguychris,16,6,17,"Ill try and do my best to keep this easy to follow. You may want to refill your coffee on this one.

Im nearly 29 years old now. And since about the age of 7 or 8
 Just a short background: Between 6 and 18, and my uncle who suffered fatal injuries from a motorcycle accident on the way to visit his sister who was in labor with her newest child. Both being my closest family members. 

Since the passing of my mother, I started to experience things in my fathers home. Dishes dropping, all of the cabinets opening, etc. Pretty basic stuff. Now I've discussed this matter with a few individuals in the past about the logic of what I've experienced, and the cemetery seems to be the most feasible explanation. But I am looking to Reddit for other possible answers.

  It was suggested that something came home with me one of the times I visited. What leads me to believe that something came with me, the same exact types of things would happen.  Being kind of creeped out, I asked various members of my family if anything else like this has ever happened since my mom or Jeff (uncle) passed. According to my grandmother on my mothers side, paranormal visions, or experiences are pretty common place in our family. The females claim to have a sort of connection in a way they can't explain. Always knowing when something happens, knowing one or the other is hurt, sick

Now I believe that I've experienced my mother as well as my uncle. The energy and feeling when experiencing these spirits have been entirely different than what I am about to detail. You know when you are protected and in the presence of a caring spirit. What I have experienced in the last 2 decades have been anything but pleasant.

It started with a feeling that you aren't alone, and when I would look it would be there long enough for me to see it for a few seconds before fading out. I started to pay more attention to this as a teenager, and started seeking out answers. Once I started digging, then things got a little more, aggressive, would be the word I suppose. Objects started moving, often being flung from their location. I started experiencing sleep paralysis, or on my back while I lay in bed. Normally felt as if someone was slightly shoving you. I started to get the feeling that whatever was around me

Side story: Having been on the topic of ghosts and the paranormal with my other close Aunt one night, but brought instant tears to my eyes. My aunt described walking into the house and feeling dread. They went into the garage where my sister and I had a massive pile of laundry, where they could get our clothes. My aunt described in detail, feeling and seeing a dark shadow in the corner of the garage where my mothers body was found. Up to that point I had never told my aunt about what I've seen. 

Another side story: I took it upon myself to bring a psychic medium to my apartment, after her claiming to see a darkness over me, watchig ( a gf wanted us to get our palms read..) I made an appointment and had the woman come to my building. Upon arriving at my apartment door, she was hesitant in opening the door. Reaching her hand back she decided that she needed to go and that her help couldn't be offered. Now this sounds like some movie shit at this point, and I really couldn't grasp what was happening any more.  I backed off from trying to figure it out and things calmed down for some time. Only recently (last couple of years) have the ""not alone"" feelings started to creep back up, and things and sounds starting to appear again.

Not a single person in my family was negative in any way toward me, I feel that something came home with me one day. Thats the only thing that makes sense to me. I ask you Reddit, WTF could this be?

Another instance, and I would try to tell someone but everywhere I turned I saw her image. Well, she killed one and I heard screaming, as I awoke from my nightmare she was hovering right above me. I laid still for a few moments, as she whispered into my ear, I tried to push her off of me.

This was fairly recent. A friend of mine and I were bored one day and decided to enter whatever place we came up to next. Sure enough, maybe minutes, until we gazed at the time, we had been there for a few hours. We watched the tombstones and the trees that surrounded them. As we walked around, (the circle/trail), we felt someone behind us, mimicking our steps. We both brushed it off. That is, I felt a tap on my right shoulder that seemed to brush my hair away from me. I stared at my friend, it was much closer to my friend who also noted it. We later end up studying for our exams so I go to his house to pick up something. We're talking in his dining room

This one happened while I still lived in my old house. I was around 8-9 when I would be trying to sleep. I had a queen's sized bed that I would sleep in whenever we had company over so my sister would also have to share with me. Anyway, but I didn't really question it. Until I TAPPED IT to see what she was doing. ""What are you doing?"" I asked, expecting it to be my sister. My sister responded from the foot of her bed; snoring. The image tilted its head. It was dark and she had no skin, it was bare with stickly hair. Like the hair you would see on an old rag doll. All I remember was hopping in to bed and just closing my eyes as hard as I could to remove that image from my mind.
I'll post some more

ETA: This again, so if anyone would pass by I could see who it was. Anyway, I was petting my dog as he was stretching about and I stopped for a moment. Both my dog and I saw a brisk shadow speed to the bathroom. My dog leaped from my bed and chased it; as did I. By the time I reached the door to the bathroom it slammed in my face. I turned the door handle, expecting there to be someone in dire need of a bathroom break; but nothing. Nothing at all. All I remember is curling up with my dog as we both fell asleep. Though, this might have nothing to do with it, sometimes both my dogs would bark at the air; maybe their just bored, I don't know.

P.S. another occurrence:  I'm not sure if this one is evil or not, I woke up to something rumbling down the kitchen. I left my bed and headed down the hallway to where the kitchen was. I just remember seeing a dark shadow or ball of gas/orb with red eyes. It sort of shook, from an angle it looked like it danced in thin air, all the while I'm staring at it befuddled.

  This all started last year, not seeing anyone, eating only what I had on hand, not even going to class. And during this week, I had nightmares every single night. I have nightmares a lot, but these were extremely consistent. They always involved me being in a forest, and there was always the exact same monster-type thing. The beast was very tall, and its arms were disproportionately long. The arms hanged down to about where its knees would be. It wore a black robe which covered its entire body except for its head. The head looked like a cow skull with deer antlers, with a few dead leaves coming out from where its mouth would be. Every time I saw it all I could feel was abject, but they were measured enough that I could tell it was some kind of language. I could understand it

  I had the dreams for about eight days, I decided I may as well go. So I went to grab my good pen (which I took to take notes on the recital, because we had to write a paper about it), and I noticed it wasn't where I usually left it. I groggily searched my tiny dorm, not finding it anywhere. Finally a opened a desk drawer, and I nearly had a heart attack. There was my pen-- next to a drawing of that fucking monster. Next to the monster were some Greek letters, some Cyrillic letters, I do many things in my sleep: talk, as I'm a shit artist when it comes to drawing. I still have the sketch

  This isn't even the really weird part. A few days later I was back in class, and when she told her grandmother about them, she (the grandmother) just nodded and said that that was what the Devil looked like. For my part, I don't think that this the devil or a demon or a fallen angel, but it's weird that her grandmother knew immediately what this was. This girl had no reason to lie to me. Fast-forward a year, and I'm relating the story to my friend James. I can see fear in his eyes; he, too

  So that's about it. Anyone know what this is? Any ideas? My best guess is that this is some sort of weird genetic-memory representation of fear. Or something. I'm not even sure what I mean by that.

The whole house can be walked around outside in less than about 2 minutes, and inside, it's only 20 steps from my bed on the farthest side of the room to across the house and into the baby's room and her crib, on the other farthest wall. 

Despite the size, Bu, so she can get a feel for the place.  I put her food bowl next to the master bathroom sink and turned the water onto a slow trickle, just the way she's always liked it.  I moved the drain stopper out of the sink and put it by the light switch about 2 feet away and we headed out to pick up our first load of boxes.

A few hours later when we get back we find Bu in the living room, more than I thought it should have for how strongly I left the water on, but I just shrug, unplug and put the stopper back by the light switch again.  We throw open windows, pull out a fan and get to work drying that half of the house out as we begin moving boxes and small pieces of furnitures in.  

That very first night, but what made things stranger was the smell of the place.  In the day time, it smelled very nice, the pine trees and flowers outside left a lovely lingering scent in the house, but as the water dried up, it began to smell... off.  I told my husband but he shrugged it off to ""pregnancy nose"" and rolled over.  Bu however seemed to agree and she made a point of sleeping between me and the master bedroom that night, purring as loudly as her tiny self could.

The next day the smell of the house had shifted back to the nice earthy scents of the world outside.  Bu found her leash and I took her out with us when we went for the second load, but I did my best to lend a hand, and Bu enjoyed being on her leash outside in the sun and grass, or chilling in the AC at my mother-in-law's.

We loved the house, and the door to the linen closet in the bathroom is less than three feet from the toilet, so you can't really escape looking at the door.  Also, something about the lighting in the bathroom would play tricks on your eyes.  It seemed at times that the floor was SWARMING with ants.  Now, if the carpet was brown or something, it'd not be so bad, but our carpet is this lovely ocean blue, it wasn't ever really regular

Fast forward a few months.  We have a brand new baby, all the beds are forced to the outside of the rooms leaving a perfect line of sight from the edge of our bed into the main bathroom, and the bath tub.  I call to my husband as he's changing for bed to grab something from the bedroom for me and he waved at me as an acknowledgment.  Out of the corner of his eye he saw a black shape ""peek"" at him from the bathtub.  He grinned and waved at it, thinking it's Bu playing ""peek-a-boo"" in the tub with him.  When he comes back into the living room he sees where Bu is laying, in my lap, and the baby is sleeping in her swing.He related the story to me with a bit of a laugh, but we were a bit spooked so we slept on the couch that night.

A year or so later we start having this issue.  It's a knocking sound.  At first my husband says it's something with the AC unit outside.  Then he claims it's something to do with the way the air comes on, and generally has nothing to do with the heating and cooling in our house.  Bu seems to be on my side, forever stalking something in the house, watching, then giving up and coming to get as much attention as she can.  At this point the baby is walking, and we've added another cat to the household.  Eventually the other cat gets blamed for the knocking, but I know that I had seen Noodle playing with the baby in her room when the knocking was coming from the kitchen.
He checked under the house to no avail

We take matters into our own hands, knocking, and shadows seem to go away, so we relax.

Our child grows, and our oldest daughter won't sleep in her room because ""it's scary in there, something whispers.""  We let her stay in our room, and our bed is full with cats and kids.  We try hard to get the whispering to stop, I smudge the room with medicines, placing medicine bundles in every place I can.  More mirrors are added to the single windowsill as well as one on the wall where our oldest can't reach it.  We buy her a fancy canopy bed and make it like a tent, telling her that she's safe in there, but the whispers are worse now

We called the landlord, not the inside ones.  The whispering quieted down, but didn't leave.  We kept working at the problem, asking friends and family, even our local minister what to do, but nothing really made a large difference.  The cats seem to only walk into the room long enough to turn around and leave just as quickly as the entered, and until our oldest turned 5

Then, happy.  Both girls would play in their room, the cats would sleep the day away, waiting for them to come home from school on their babies beds.  I never got that eerie feeling anywhere in the house.

Then, insomnia followed by periods of almost overwhelming lethargy.  No one had the same issue at the same time, and medications began accumulating.  Extra strength cough syrups, super decongestants, antibiotics, sleeping pills, anti anxiety meds, and more.   The problems keep happening though, but the wood is almost black

Bu had a heart attack and passed on a few years ago, they complain of nightmares.

We own the place now

I just hope that the whispering doesn't start up again.",,t5_2sntx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/ndf0s/we_live_in_a_pos_me_fam_xpost_to_rnosleep/

Two buddies and myself were hanging out in the garage one night when we noticed a certain star seemed to be flickering very brightly and shifting colors. I can't say this had any connection to what we saw next, thinking it was a bird, but my glance caused one of my friends to look up and i snapped my head back with the sudden realization that the ""bird"" I had glanced at seemed to be two masses instead of one. The masses were light-grey and oval and seemed way too close to each other and too large to be birds (maybe pelicans but we're not that close to the sea). Small wings came off both sides, but seemed to join in between them. No head was visible at the front end of the oval (defiantly not pelicans). The wings did not appear to move, but the object glided along at around 30 or 40mph, or at least a fast speed for a bird. It was gliding about the height of the telephone poles plus another half pole. It passed directly over us and shortly after, both masses appeared to turn in and combine into a V shape, then turned back in towards each other and formed the V shape again. About this time me and my friends all look at each other and start freaking the fuck out. I wouldn't write this if it wasn't true. I've told people this story and got crazy looks but I don't care because its true. I know I wasn't hallucinating because my friends saw the exact same thing

It is also not the creepeiest of my experiences but the most historical.

Just outside the city of Lublin

My friends and I decided to check it out around Halloween. We hopped on the bus in the mid-morning
We arrive and there is a large [stone entrance](http://faculty.berea.edu/gowlers/remembering/majdanek/main_monument.jpg). We snapped some pictures and made our way inside. 

Most of it is a large field with a few rows of guard towers and cabins.  Off in the distance is a large memorial which is filled with the ashes of the victims.

We walk into the first building. It contains cans of Zyklon B and remnants of a gassing room. It smells putrid. No one says a word as they walk through. I'm the only one with a camera and make my way through faster than everyone else. I go outside to take a couple of pictures. 

I set my camera bag outside and set it on a large stone that is resting in the grass. I turn to the corner of the building and take a picture. I begin to turn back around and pick up my camera bag.  As I'm turning

I'm very creeped out at this point

We make our way to another building. The only source of light is from the sunlight peeping in from the open door.  Inside are columns of 10-foot high containers containing nothing more than shoes. The room past a few feet is pitch dark.

All of a sudden we hear children's laughter coming from the back. None of us can see anything but assume that it is a kid who was there with his parents (a safe assumption as there were a decent amount of people there).  We finish up and start to leave when one of my friends says that no one left the building and the laughter and noise continued.  I engaged the flash on my camera in hopes of seeing something.  Nothing.  I make my way down the rows and the laughter gets closer.  I make it to the end... nothing.

We continued through the camp and make it to the back. In the back is the oven (it's purpose

As we leave the oven and head towards the memorial we all begin to hear singing. It was a low toned song. Somewhat like the singing you would hear slaves singing. It lacked happiness.

My Polish friend walks over to a group of Polish people and ask if they heard it too. They said that it was common and could be heard as far as the houses in the area. 

People have asked if all of the city is haunted.  It seems to me that,,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,True

A Google maps link is [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=majdanek+concentration+camp+lublin+poland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.221024,22.613608&amp;sspn=0.003595,0.009645&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=h&amp;z=15).

I'm going into my fourth year of studying in Poland (thankfully my last).  I began school in October of 2008.

The city of Lublin is relatively small. Most of it's population is students (there are 4 or 5 universities there). The beginnings of the our school years (the Polish students don't start yet) are quiet. The only people there are the year-round population -- mostly old people with a sprinkling of a younger generation. 

My first year of studies (pre-med) was pretty boring and simple.  My mind would wander and I was always searching for something to do -- our only non-night club amenities are a movie theater and a bowling alley.

By Halloween we were all looking for something to do and the frightening nature of the holiday set in.  From a Polish friend (born there but grew up in the U.S. who attended school with me in the American Program) we learned of Majdanek and the surrounding cemetery.  In Poland Halloween is celebrated by paying respect to family members that have passed.

Halloween night rolls around and a group of 5 us decide to go check it out. We hop in a cab (our only night-time method of transportation) and head out to the cemetery.  As we drive up the haunting glow of thousands of candles (for the holiday) littered the grounds and gave the area an eerie glow.

We get to the entrance and there is a small barrier keeping us out and we hop over it. We walk around and stop at random grave sites

We continue to walk and eventually we come across an area that is the burial grounds for children. There is a sudden sound of a branch snapping from a tree. I hear it hurdling towards my head and I quickly skirt out of the way. We pass it off as wind but in the back of all of our mind's we knew there was none.

One of us recommends that we start heading back to the entrance and then the dorms. We all quickly agree. As we are walking back

Within 30 seconds the entire field which was once lit by these thousands of candles goes dark. Every one was out. We smell death. It's the smell of decay and burnt flesh. One of the girls begins to cry and we try our best to reassure her.

We didn't know what to do so we very slowly started tip-toeing towards the entrance (a good quarter-mile away).  In hindsight

We leave the group and get about 300 yards away and we hear shouting. We turn around and our friends are trying to get our attention. A circle of candles around them had lit back up. My friend and I are still in darkness. We are close to the entrance and decide to go the rest of the way.

All of a sudden the both of us are shoved apart, and nods. We hear whispering, too faint to understand. It sounds like a chant, the same thing repeated over and over.

The whispering turns to shouting. It is booming and we are certain anyone in the area can hear it.

We both make eye contact and sprint towards the entrance and jump over the stone fence. The streetlights are comforting but our friends are still inside. We call them and tell them to come up front. About 10 minutes later we hear them shuffling towards us.

They ask me what happened to my leg and I tell them.  They heard no shouting. They tell us that as soon as we left that the candles around them had re-lit.  

The cab arrives 10 minutes later and we hop inside.  As we drive back

I will post another shorter story about my experiences at the actual concentration camp later today or tomorrow.

Driving around we check out the sights. Half an hour later we are horrendously lost. There is one obvious solution. South

Twenty minutes later we drive through a small... I don't know what to call it. The houses looked like somebody had plucked a small community out of the suburbs and plopped them down in the high desert. Six houses, but that was it.

Though there were cars in the driveway there was not a sign of life. No children, or even insects. Nobody mowing the manicured green lawns, no sprinklers going, no signs of life anywhere. The feeling that we had somehow accidentally driven onto a staged set, combined with the fact that we should have reached (Not even half the thirty minutes earlier had been spent driving north, most of it was east.) the interstate several minutes ago did not help matters any.

As you may have read, does NOT remember the encounter despite the fact it was so etched into my brain.

Just recently I was talking to my other sister, so I brought it up as topic of conversation. I was most likely telling her about /spacedicks or something like that. Later on I mentioned some of the subreddits I like to read during downtime at work and naturally this one came up. 

I kind of offhandedly mentioned the story I posted about the UFO sighting me and Chels had and kind of brushed it off because even in front of my own flesh and blood I feel silly telling a story that seems so unbelievable. 

I wasn't really expected her to probe me for details, that wasn't Chels you were with, that was ME"". She was able to finish my story to a T. She took the words right out of my mouth and recounted the story exactly how I remember. 

Since we're triplets I'm used to outsiders getting us mixed up

We spent the next few minutes absolutely reeling over this revelation. I was a combination of relieved that I was not

Unfortunately though for Erica, dreams that seemed *too* real. She recalls snapping out of sleep and seeing things out of the corners of her eyes and such. I'm not at all disputing the fact that they very well could be your average night terrors from a traumatic experience, that could very well explain the ""dreams"", but I thought it would be important to include that tid bit.

I tried to probe her more about these ""dreams"" but I could tell she was REALLY scared over the whole thing and made it very clear that she did not want to talk about it anymore. I could see it in her eyes that this has really affected her over the years and I almost feel bad for being the one to confirm that I did

Not too much later I brought it up to my little brother, but when I started talking about it he looked at me like something clicked in his head.

Maybe 5 minutes into putting the music on, After that I felt as if someone turned heater on, my head felt weird, like it felt kinda compressed, for lack of a better term. All this happened while 
the music was playing but I couldn't hear it properly, with so much clarity I heard "" I'm coming to get you"" Which evidently isn't part of the song, and I doubt I could have misheard it. I felt horrified, but also depressed, more so than normal, after that I just fell asleep. 

The night after was similar, but this time I felt someone grab my shoulder and whisper something, I believe he said ""you"" but i could be wrong, but at anyrate still spooky. 

I deducted from the last 2 nights that when I play music some spirit or whatevers get pissed off or something and fucks with me and the bubbling shoulder is I guess pre-warning. The night after spooky ghost talking I played the music again, heat, depressed, feeling watched.
Don't know what ""it is"" but as far as I can gather it hangs out around my, those feelings that someones outside your door, even voices, conversations coming from places around the house at night, I guess music just real pisses it off.

**A Couple Of My Creepy Experiences**

It was a late night, this is what I felt like.  Unfortunately, I had no where else to go to finish my assignment so I turned up my music and kept working.

It wasn't long before I started hearing footsteps around me.  I couldn't decipher where they were coming from, still feeling the dread and tension in the atmosphere.  The footsteps started again....they were matching my movement into the living room.

This was highly confusing to me because The only rooms upstairs were my cousins' rooms and a bathroom, and the space to the left of the front door.  No matter where I went in the house, I could hear the footsteps following my direction from above.  There wasn't a floor above the kitchen table or living room, these were extended high ceilings.  The footsteps started turning into stomping/scurrying.  I got so scared I packed all my stuff and booked it out of there.  I ended up spending the night at a friends house.

Another time when my aunt and cousins were on a cruise for the week, like the space and darkness would swallow you whole.  I decided I would quickly shower and maybe call some friends to see if they wanted to hang out.  As I'm taking off my shoes I put down my bags and look over at the staircase.  The light at the top of the stairs was on.  I nearly shat myself.  This was a couple days after everyone had left for the cruise, and I was the only one home.  I have a very good habit of keeping doors/windows locked, as well as shutting off lights when they're not in use.  I was very alarmed to see the light on, to say the least.  I charged up the stairs, turned off the light, grabbed a few articles of clothing from my room and left the house.

Unless you've been in that situation where you sense something unknown may be willing to harm you


**My Cousin's Story**

My cousin's first encounter with April was a couple months after my first encounter.  She was home alone during the afternoon.  Munching on chips on the living room sofa watching tv, she noticed it was her mom's door that had closed.  Thinking it was the wind or something, she went make it wide open again (she likes having doors open to be able to see into rooms).  When she sits back down and is about to change the channel, she sees almost exactly what I saw: a female dressed in white with long black hair going from the left side of the room to the right.

A few nights later she told me she told me she was having dreams about a woman with long black hair silently following her around the house.  She swears that when she woke up she could hear a girl's/woman's voice in her room.

**EDIT:**



**BACKGROUND:**

I attended Point Park University from 2011-2012 as a freshman cinema major. One night, we were filming our video when we started hearing noises and voices, such as banging on the air vents and piping in the bathroom. It was actually happening so much that we decided to throw the video out the window, and come back down to do a little ghost hunt.

To make a very long story short, cold spots, noises, people running outside the bathroom in the hall, banging on pipes/walls/air vents, and obviously captured EVPs. In one rare instance, two of our team members were exiting the bathroom when they saw a shadowy figure run up some stairs and through a locked door.

A few of our team members decided that they were going to do some research. They found out that the Pittsburgh Paranormal Society [had done an investigation](http://www.pointparkglobe.com/news/investigators-say-paranormal-activity-intense-1.1736262#.UUyVSDfIerg) in the office of Point Park's newspaper

The more we investigated the more evidence we found. There was a small locker room attached to this bathroom, but rather a different, negative spirit. Because we felt uneasy around this spirit we would restrict our time in the bathroom only to when we believed Jacob was around. If we felt uneasy we would dismiss Jacob or any other spirits we had talked to and leave immediately.

We also believe we had made contact with a spirit in the girls' bathroom on that floor. Only three of our members were only able to get accurate activity in the bathroom

One night while talking to Jacob, and it scared us very much. We stayed away from the bathroom for a few days, and when we finally did return we were all shook up. Listening back to the EVP recording of the night we went back, I can hear the pure terror in my voice as I was asking questions (I was naturally the lead investigator). Many of the team, including myself, felt uneasy that night so we left. We did not go back to the bathroom.

I was unable to go back to school this year due to financial reasons, and the first few times they went there wasn't much of a response at all. The very last time they went down to the bathroom, one of the members (probably the person who is most ""in-tune"" with the spiritual world other than myself) had a vision of horns and satanic/dark images while investigating. They have not been down to the bathroom since.

1361487452.0,18zfln,I see/hear creepy shit [Part 2],arrownin,15,4,11,"A while ago I posted here about the strange things that I've heard and seen throughout my childhood. Thus

I saw a shadow person, and I saw it on the side of the road, and the second was when it flew over/into me when I was exiting my kitchen at night. 

Now, so I guess it was about 7"" tall. It did not have defined edges like a shadow would. It was like if you had cried, and tried to look at a shadow? The edges of the shadow person were very hard to make out, but very apparent at the same time. Maybe the best example for the edges would be if you spilled ink onto a piece of rice paper. It made no sound, and it did not make wind or anything when it flew over me, it was completely silent. Even though the edges were hard to make out, I could see a very apparent humanoid figure, body, and the dark of night

So,Hawaii, it's where I live). At first, it was in the shadows, so I thought it was some random bum on the side of the road, or just some street sign, or something, the car turned just enough to shine the headlights upon the figure, but it was fully visible and had light pouring onto it by the car's lights. I really wish I could explain it, I felt like it was unnatural

My second encounter was in my kitchen. This was about 4 years after that incident. I was going for a midnight snack, my kitchen is pretty small,and has a single door frame as an exit to the hall which has my room. Down the hall to the right, there are stairs that go down to the front door. I walked to the door frame, and all of a sudden, out of fucking NOWHERE, this big dark figure of a man comes floating up the stairs VERY quickly, and then was gone. Like an owl swooping down to it's prey

And that's it. My encounter with shadow people, but I think it's pretty interesting. I'm not afraid of them, but I'm defiantly respectful of them. Hopefully you got a scare out of my experiences.

I could talk about some other times I had some paranormal encounters, or I can tell my grandpa's encounters. (My family has a history with this stuff) ",,False,,t5_2sntx,False,,

I lived there with my husband (my boyfriend back then) and two cats (whom we still have). The cats would sometimes stare at the ceiling/upper walls in certain spots, or...hey, they're cats, cats stare at weird things! (but in hindsight--we have lived in two additional apartments since then, including our current one--which has active neighbors--and our cats did/do not stare at random spots in these apartments).

Anyway, which was normal for me back then (my boyfriend always went to bed at around 11pm since he had to get up early for work). My cats usually went to bed with me, but they did not on this night, and after laying awake for a while, I decided to call to to them or try to see what they were up to (I can easily see the short hallway/dining area from that bedroom, and if the cats were running around like fools, I would have seen them as they raced through that space--these cats are a light/buff orange tabby and mostly-white calico

So, deep, deep dark black mass with a rough head/shoulder/torso shape--the rest kind of trailed off. It was night, and it was dark, but there was enough dim light in the apartment for me to easily see this thing. It was blacker than black--as if a black hole had somehow taken on a form and appeared in my apartment. Baffled, I leaned forward in bed and peered at it, trying to figure out what the fuck it was. I really didn't believe my eyes at first--I'm by nature a logical person

After I gawked at it for a few seconds, I saw it had red eyes. At that very second, I was overcome by intense fear and dread--I can tell you that I have been in some very scary situations in my life, but the fear I felt at that moment was more raw than any other I have felt--and right after it turned to look straight at me, it flew through the bedroom doorway at me, towards my face.

I did the only thing I could think of and ducked underneath the covers. ""Terrified"" only scratches the surface of how I felt then.

After a few moments, I felt like it was safe to pull the covers off my head. Not wanting to seem like a crazy person, I told him I had a nightmare and tried to sleep. It did not come easily to me that night.

I did eventually tell my boyfriend what I had seen that night

We grabbed a 12 pack of yuengling, my younger sister &amp; my boyfriend. When we got there, we went and sat in the living room area &amp; all mindlessly drank a beer while attempting conversation. I was sitting on a couch with my boyfriend while my sister was on a rocking chair facing toward us. 

My father called and told me that they were going to be taking my sister off life support right then. 

After announcing the information I had received &amp; a little bit of convo...I was staring out the window, I looked at my sister and knew immediately that she had seen exactly what I had just seen. At the same time we both said, completely in sync, ""you saw it too"". After that moment we both kind of started to freak out and decided that we couldn't be there anymore and left almost immediately.

1354213561.0,14074x,Another post reminded me of my time in Jacksonville,dontbait,12,2,2,"My brother was stationed down in Jacksonville FL. The family had planned a trip down to visit him before he was deployed to Africa. I had arrived a couple days before the rest of the family and was treated to a personal tour of the small 3 bedroom house. I'd gotten a weird feeling as soon as I stepped foot into the house, I had spent alot of time alone in the house partnered with his new pup ""Yenko"" 
   
My brother would leave at 5 AM, so without a car, I spent most of my time on the couch in front of the tv. One of the days when I was home alone watching tv, I hear some clunking in the kitchen. I got up, walked into the kitchen, grabbed a drink and returned to my butt grove on the couch. The noise continued, so i got back up and went to refill my drink. I walked back into the kitchen to find every cupboard and drawer opened, and went to sit back on the couch. The noises continue over the coarse of the next half hour or so

The next day, and cowering backwards towards the middle of the living room. I believe it was roughly 4 PM at the time, and outside I sat until my brother got home at 6.

The family was arriving tomorrow, walked 10' down the hall to his room. At the door I noticed the music did get louder, but seemed to get louder the closer I got to the living room. His door opened and I screamed the most embarassing scream to date. He was a bit upset at me for waking him up, and asked what in the world I was doing playing music while he was trying to sleep. I let him know what was going on, and we began searching the house. Thinking it was coming for the neighbors, I stepped outside only to hear traffic. We pinpointed the source of the music to just outside the dining room, where nothing was. We both just shrugged and went back to bed.

My family had finally arrived, the light switched itself off. My brother gets up and clicks it back on. ""has that ever happened before?"" asked my mom. ""No"" my brother laughed as he sat back down...

 We’re both scary movie addicts, so we decided to Google movies to download. We were both in a silly creepy mood when we started browsing, but it quickly turned more to the dark side just by the blurbs on some of the movies we found. She slowly became more and more sober, eventually simply sitting there quietly, propped up on my headboard, and staring down at her hands. The conversation died pretty quickly with that change in her, so I just continued to click away at my laptop as I had been doing, breaking the silence. 

“Do you... Do you ever

“Like, but she didn’t smile. 

“No, a small chill going past my head. Sometimes it'll seem like a whisper...” She trailed off and looked at me, “I dunno. It kinda feels like someone rubs their fingers together right near my ear. And it freaks me out! I’ll spin around, but of course nothings there.”

“What do they whisper?’ I asked.

“My name. And then, more talking, but never make it out. Sort of like a radio station going in and out of frequency. ”

“Well that’s creepy as shit.” I said. “But no

At this point I could tell she wasn’t just saying this to creep me out, her eyes had somehow gotten darker and her face pale. Now, while I’d like to believe in ghosties and ghoulies, I always pull a Scully when I hear of a supernatural experience. And this time I did just that – I dismissed what she was telling me and chalked it up to her own poor hearing and paranoia. She was quiet the rest of the night, and I didn’t think about it again. Until the other night.

Laura picked me up from work in the evening and we went straight to her house. She paints at a bar here in town, so we stayed till around midnight, both being too tired to drink. By the time we left we were just hungry and sleepy, and it seemed pancakes were on the menu at her place. When we got there, we went straight into the dark house, bypassing her garage, and bee-lined for the kitchen. Most of her roommates were gone, so we didn’t bother keeping our voices down. We got the pancake ingredients out and started whipping them together. Laura was struggling with the mixing part when she had the brilliant idea to grab some chocolate chips we kept stashed in the garage and make the pancakes all chocolatey goodness. She wasted no time shoving the mixing bowl into my arms and scampering off to the front door. So I stood there

She had left the kitchen a few moments before I heard the whisper. I don’t know how long it was going on before I noticed it, trying to get my attention, to alert me to someone hooking up on the couch or something. I clutched the mixing bowl tightly, stirring mechanically as I turned my head slowly to my right, staring across the empty kitchen into the gaping darkness of the living room.
 
‘Laura?’ My voice was wavering.
 
 Now that it - they, excited. They were saying more, but I couldn’t understand any of it. It had a cruel, distorted, and gleeful tone. Like they knew I couldn’t understand them; knew exactly what they were doing, how terrified it made me-, and they enjoyed it. There was no way in hell I thought I could move, just beyond the light, staring into the dark

I was still standing like that a minute later when Laura opened the front door and came in, so if it is some entity, it must be staying inside. The weird thing is- she's lived there 3 years and we've never experienced anything like this before. Someone on nosleep said it could be a demon, but they're not all that helpful...

1343288175.0,x6h63,[ME] Footsteps and shadows in the basement. ,kevler9oh,12,1,0,"[Original Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/wn07g/me_my_exgirlfriend_a_mutual_friend_and_myself_go/)

Since everyone was interested in my other story, Josh, Kyle, and Emma are all our mutual friends. Josh is very interested in the paranormal and was the one who took us to the gravesite in the first story I told you guys. 

Around the second or third night Josh and I hung out after work, which was in the basement, and watch music videos on youtube. You know, typical teenager stuff. This night, we were in the basement, in my room. The basement in my dad's house was unfinished, it had nothing but insulation on the walls everywhere, a winter project my dad and I took up. My dad basically used the basement for storage of his tools. I had always heard things being down in the basement, basement sounds were rare. The real noises that I always heard were upstairs near the front of the house. The front of the house had a wooden floor

I guess the concept of this intrigued Josh when I told him. He said he's heard that as well only being in my room for, hauntings and witches and Indian Burial Grounds, all of it was something that really piqued his interests. He began asking me all about the footsteps and any other things that I may have experienced. I told him that was it, aside from the - what I thought was typical - things that go ""bump"" in the night.

Josh figured it would be best that he stay the night, plan as ever. Just like someone walking upstairs. It was kind of crazy. I'm a skeptic and don't believe many paranormal stories and I always dismissed those noises and just ""wood settling in"" or whatever I thought it was. 

I told my girlfriend at the time, she said she too had heard things but never wanted to say anything since I was, like I said, a skeptic and ""wouldn't believe her anyway."" Later that same day, Holly, our friend Megan, and myself were sitting in the garage talking and the topic of ghosts came up. Megan said, if either of us had ever heard the footsteps. Holly took that question way worse than I did

Flash forward a couple of months, on her knees in front of me. She was giving me a blowjob and all of the sudden she stopped, glancing out of the corner of her eye out the door. Shit, is my dad home without me realizing?! I look out the door and see nothing. The lights are on, but there's nothing. She said she saw something, and so I frustratedly pulled my sweatpants up and walked out of my room to nothing. She peaked her head out of my room and asked if I saw anything and if she could come with me if I'm going to check out the rest of the house. I asked her what she saw and she says there was a shadow of someone walking, as if they walked down into the basement and realized my door was open and started walking to my room. I checked out the rest of the house and there was nothing. She said she was sorry and I hugged her and said it was fine. We went to sleep that night and I didn't hear anything else about it for the next couple of days.

It was a Friday and we invited another mutual friend-couple over to hang out, our dinner plans required Kyle and me to go out to the grocery store to pick up some supplies. On my way to the grocery store my phone rings and it's Holly. She's crying and said that something happened and we need to come back home immediately. She said that a glass of Gatorade was thrown down in the kitchen while she and Emma were in the living room and when they went to see what had happened, the TV in my dad's room - which was located hear the living room - turned on to static and was really loud and his bathroom sink was turned on. Kyle and I were running back to my car when the phone rang again and it was Holly. She was panicking and screaming that Emma had a seizure. I told her to not touch her and we would be home in five minutes. 

When we got in the door, TV on static and the sink on full blast in my dad's room. I turned off the television and the sink. Everything went back to normal. Kyle and I went ahead with dinner and the rest of the evening went on fine. 

I ended up telling my friend Josh about what happened

I'll start

It pains me to say, because I don't think there is such a thing as a ""soul"". I believe there is humanity, and good, but i don't think there's this ""thing"" that lives on after us. I also don't believe in God... at all.

I believe in them for reasons i've already detailed in my stories. Now

If I had to guess, such as these things and other ""feelings."" I don't want to sound like a quack, but emotions are powerful things, and maybe it's these things that leave the residues, like a loop or an idea that remains behind. I believe that when we die, it goes dark.. forever. I don't think these things are aware.

I don't believe in seances, and that you're familiar with them, I believe you even less than I did originally... which is hardly at all. I think these things are extremely rare, but maybe it is true that some people, either by luck or other things, are more prone to see experience them more often.

Basically

How do I feel about them?

Terrified out of my fucking wits. I've had many people tell me they cannot harm me... well, left me traumatized... and i don't use the word lightly. She did nothing but stand there, and her back was too me, yet that image disturbs me to no end, and my mind keeps picking at it like a sore... and like a sore it only grows when that happens. Any time my mind wishes to recoil at the fact that i believe, i can't help but remember her and the clear image i have in my head. It haunts me.

And the second encounter was malicious, excuse me while I say, these fucking things scare me, and with good reason. God forbid I ever look one in the face, or in the eye, or see the lady again for that matter. And don't get me started with gore or disembodied parts. I'll seriously, no joke, i fear seeing a face looking back at me. That thought makes my eyes water. what if it moves? or smiles? or comes at me? I'm fucking dead.

Hi guys

This happened at Camp Cho Yeh – a Christian summer camp in Livingston Texas.  I am not now

I was 8 years old, but I hadn’t.  In fact I was just starting to lean away from him and the Church.

I don’t think he was trying to scare me into believing, or to anyone else at camp.  I would lay awake at night, staring up at the high ceiling of the cabin.  My imagination would form sinister faces out of the knots and grain of the wood.  There was a good portion of those 2 weeks where I didn’t sleep.  

We played capture the flag one night.  Had my counsellor not rattled my world

Livingston is Northeast of Houston, dark columns because the lowest branches are usually out of reach. The towering foliage blocks out any moonlight.  The ground is soft with dead pine needles, so it’s relatively quiet, even when a hundred or so kids are running through the woods trying not to be heard.

So I was alone, but somehow kept getting further away from the green lights and sounds of the other kids until I could no longer see or hear them.  I came to a wide clearing where the power lines cut through the trees.  To my left and right was a bare valley of grass with humming wires overhead, but now I could see a bit better from the light of the moon.  I don’t recall if it was a full moon, but it was bright enough.  I crouched down in the grass, in the shadows at the edge of the woods, watching and listening intently.  I no longer cared about winning the game, I just wanted to get back with the other kids and feel safe.

Something happened at this point that I can’t explain.  It still makes my hair stand up and makes my eyes water 20 years later.  I heard pounding footsteps coming toward me from the shadows to my left, and exhaling a bullish snort as its feet hit the grass.  I buried my head into my knees as it passed behind me, too scared to look at it directly.  

But I looked just after it had passed.  The moon was high, with an elongated and bent head.  It was already about 30 yards away from me and, quicker than it came, it disappeared into the woods where the game was being played.  Behind me, in the grass of the clearing, was one large foot-like impression, as though it had run around me and stepped out into the moonlight only for a second.

I tore off through the clearing, they never said anything about it to me.

I didn’t do so well the rest of camp

It was only in the evenings when I started to experience a feeling of intense unease. I like to read before sleeping, and read long into the night. Not long after I began this practice, I started to experience an overwhelming feeling of being watched. My bed sat against the short side of the wall directly opposite the side with the bar, and I could not stop myself from compulsively peering around the book, sure I would catch something staring at me from behind the bar. I had never experienced this type of paranoia before, and part of me thought I was going a little crazy. Years later, knowing what I know now, but there was nothing.

It became a pretty routine feeling, turned over and pulled the covers over me leaving only enough room for me to see my digital clock (I had started doing this only after moving in to this room) and settled down to get some sleep. 

Immediately upon closing my eyes, bolted straight up and I groped wildly for the cord to the light, which of course began to swing erratically, remaining out of my reach. After a few moments of flailing that in retrospect were almost comic, I was able to turn the light on.

Nothing there.

Not a thing.
But there was no doubt in my mind that something had grabbed my shoulder. I had not been asleep, and I am comfortably familiar with the 'sleep paralysis' phenomenon, and it has never frightened me. After a few minutes of deliberating, I decided that whatever had touched me was not a serious threat, and returned to my sleeping position. I was not molested again that night.

Fast forward a few years. The watchfulness and paranoia remain, just intrusive. But this is only speculation - I have neither seen nor heard anything,  nor has my family remarked on anything weird. 
And then one night, from alignment down one side of the bed to a position all the way across the bed, essentially rendering me spread eagle. All the while I'm thinking ""my muscles aren't contracting, wtfwtfwtf.."".
 
Cue another frantic grab for the light. Again, I am **righteously pissed**.  ""Excuse me, mister!"", I bark at the empty room, ""I understand that this was your place for a long time while you were alive, but you sir are DEAD. I have to live here now and I am just trying to get some SLEEP. Now you will kindly back the fuck off and leave me alone or I am shortly going to get VERY FUCKING PERTURBED!"". Feeling a little bit like an idiot, but somehow a lot comforted, up until I moved out to go to college

While I was in college
One night, where around a small divider, my current boyfriend sat discussing existential issues with my Dadoo. It was a warm, happy time. 

At one point in the night, watching us play Dutch Blitz. I began to talk to him without looking around. I noticed shortly that my mom and sister were looking at me like I was wearing a Napoleon hat and speaking in Pig Latin. It was then that I realized that I could still hear my dad and boyfriend speaking quietly in the living room. Whoever I was speaking to,  it was not my dad. 

I am still skeptical about what I *believe* to be honestly going on here, is ultimately benign and simply bored. I have never used a Ouija to try to contact it, as I'm not sure I believe in the usefulness of such a device, but I am open to any suggestions as to how I may address this entity in the future.

1330332633.0,q7wt9,[ME] My collected paranormal experiences,,10,0,6,"I apologize if this is a re-post of my old stories

Anyway

I noticed the first true paranormal event when I was told to sleep in my own room (as one of my sisters moved out). I was scared as shit, feeling scared still, the light above my parents bed started to behave the same way. My dad unscrewed the lightbulb and told me to go back to sleep, which I did hours later. The two lights were on separate circuits, and no other lights/appliances on the same circuit behaved the same way either. 

Second event:

My old grandma had a small tower clock which my mom inherited when she died. Said clock was a pretty interesting piece of mechanic engineering which had a distinct sounding gong played (kind of like a full size tower clock would have). I remember being utterly fascinated with it's old style roman lettering and the fact that you had to wind it up for it to work. 

That all changed when they mothballed the clock as some of the mechanisms in the clock had broken down and wasn't working anymore, I would hear the goddamned clock still randomly chiming in the broom closet where it was stashed. I told my dad about it and he told me not to be silly as there was no way that could chime with it's springs removed. They later threw away the clock although it was highly treasured by my mother, I always found that odd, but I've never gotten any other reason other than ""it was broken"".

Last story:

Later on in life, when I needed to pee suddenly. So put down the knife on the cutting board and head for the toilet. When I come back, the knife had been thrust into the cutting board and was still trembling from the force it took. I freaked and ran out of the apartment and slammed the door behind me. I returned later in the day (this was before cell phones were common) and hoped my parents had returned which they thankfully had. I got a scolding for having ruined the cutting board despite my assurances it wasn't me. (and they told me I hadn't locked the door, which I hadn't when I ran out there in fear) The knife had been thrust through the cutting board and the tip was protruding slightly into the table too.

There are other experiences by my family, years after, we talked to someone who lived in the apartment next door and they told us that they'd also experienced weird things while they lived there. I guess something really bad happened there that caused this whole thing.

Edit: Debunking is welcome, although with my paranoia, I don't see how.

She was 13 and her sister was 10 when they made their summer pilgrimage to Portugal. They still had family in the Azores Islands.

One night balmy night the family sat at a picnic table next to the vineyard in the backyard. My friend’s father had been feeling really run down the whole trip and it seemed that it was finally catching up to him. He told his family that he would head to bed for the night and try to sleep off the slump into which he felt himself slipping deeper. This was a very abnormal action for him but my friend’s mother wasn’t too concerned.
 
Worst case scenario if her father needed anything he could just lean out of the upstairs window that he was laying next to and yell down for help. The night carried on and the stars shone overhead.

This story isn't paranormal in any way but it is true and is by far the scariest thing that has ever happened to me.

One weekend when I was about 17 my parents went to Las Vegas for a few days. They left me in charge of the house and told me to drop in every now and then to check in on things, etc.

I left my girlfriends house late that Friday night and decided to stop by the house and grab a change of clothes before heading to a friend's place. I parked my truck in my backyard as was typical for me

However

As soon as I flipped on the switch one of my cats sprinted past me and out my bedroom door

As I made my way through the house I decided to grab a quick glass of water before leaving, and begin to fill it. The sink I was using was positioned directly below the kitchen window, and as I stood there I peered out from the open blinds. It was dark outside, but I could still see vaguely due to the nearby streetlamps. Everything was bathed in an eery orange glow.

As soon as I turned off the faucet the silence around me was shattered by the most terrifying thing I've ever heard. It was a man's voice

My body shut down and I froze

I could tell right away that he wasn't in the house, gripping the front of his shirt with his left hand and swinging at the air with a metal pipe in his right. He was stumbling and raving and screaming while walking away from the tunnel that I assumed he came from. He had short-cropped dark hair, and what was most disturbing to me was what he wearing. He was wearing a dark suit and tie with white sneakers. He just didn't look like an ordinary homeless person or junkie.

Amongst his screaming he stopped and looked straight at me through the window.

As soon as we made eye contact he stared at me for just a moment. I looked back horrified and too afraid to move an inch. Then he broke his gaze and broke off into a sprint, my vehicle was back there and my back door was unlocked.

I turned and ran to the back door. I opened it long enough to close and lock the metal gate that shared it's frame and then shut and dead-bolt the door. When I opened the door I thought for sure I would see him running through the yard

I sat down in a corner in my kitchen and scrambled to find my cell phone and call for help.

I phoned the police and gave them my address and information. I stayed on the line until they arrived. They searched everywhere and found nothing. They told me it was most likely a bum or a prank. I didn't really care

The next afternoon as I walked out to my truck to leave my friends house I noticed a metal pipe in the back of my truck

Ok
I was shocked because I told her not to come in

She said that I had gotten out of bed *(at this point, and then a little louder and I had stopped when I reached the door...this is when it got weird. She said the door started to creak open slowly without me touching it, and then ""my"" body began to turn towards her; as ""I"" walked towards her, she said her vision went crazy...as if she was having a seizure *(she doesn't know what that's like, but I do and it's what it sounded like)*...she began seeing spots pop before her eyes and the bedside lamp was flickering on and off.
That's when she had had enough.
At that point, and the occurrence ended. Then she ran to the bathroom.


It was very odd, I was teetering on the edge of consciousness due to the overheating and pain...and I wound up lying in my bathtub with all my night clothes on as it filled up with freezing cold water. Thus began the worst pain of my life *(and living with daily Migraines, Cluster Migraines and Aura...I know pain. We're close.)*


I don't know what brought this extreme pain on...I don't know if it was just something I ate

There was a door in his room.  That is to say inside his room, and craning his neck there was nothing behind it.  He got scared and covered his head under his quilt.  However the door remained no matter how long he hid underneath the quilt cover, and he eventually fell asleep.  In the morning the door was gone.

So, and hooked up an N64 to the TV in the back of the van and were having a hell of a time before we even got to the road. 

When we got there

We finished our smokes and made our way down to the first stopping point. We stopped and read a historical marker and walked around a bit with flashlights. Nothing unusual. 

We continued on to the second stop point with another historical marker. This time, subtly change colors and vary in brightness. Definitely not characteristic of what you would expect headlights to look like (most common debunker of the myth). It appeared for  40-50 seconds and dissipated into the woods. We continued on. It was about 12:28 when this happened.

We drove on for a ways and came to a third historical marker. We decided to set up a hookah there and smoke while sitting in some lawn chairs we brought. We got to the point of bringing the chairs out when we saw it again. It was very faint at first, the light became gradually brighter. After looking at it for 15 seconds or so, it was clear that the light was coming towards us. All of a sudden, it changed from an amber yellow color to a bright white. Everybody started freaking the fuck out and trying to leave. I stood in the road with my other ballsy friend and waited to see what would happen. At this point we did get some nice shots of the light (2 if I remember correctly) and will post them as soon as I get them from the photographer we had with us. The light was still coming towards us at about the speed of a person jogging. My friends girlfriend was crying at this point so we had to get in the van and head forward. We happened to be going in the same direction as the light, but it shortly vanished once we were driving. Also of possible significance, the temperature felt a very dramatic 15 degrees or so cooler than it did at our last stop. Not sure if that is significant or not; but thought it would be worth mentioning. This all happened at 12:40 or so.

We finished the road

After this trip

We got some very good photos of the light

The first night there is when weird shit happens. There are only five of us there the first night. Two couples and my self. The couples got the rooms with the big beds and shit, kind of nice really for when there's a bunch of drunk people in here later im thinking. I lay down and listen to music on my ipod shuffle trying to get tired. A few minutes after I lay down not even before i finish my first song my bed starts shaking. Its sort of a light vibration, my first reaction was that it was my buddies brother banging his girlfriend in the room downstairs. But then i remember that my room is over the living room and infact in the corner of the house. So as I rule that option out, my bed starts shaking a little harder. The next logical thing that pops into my head is that my other friend staying in the connecting room has army crawled into my room down the hallway and is physically shaking my bed, because it literally feels like someone is latched onto the baseboard of the bead. I sit up and look over the footboard truly expecting to see my buddy on the floor laughing at my scared face. There, however, was nothing there, just my bed. I start to get really scared once I logically rule all these other options out. I want to get out of this bed and run out of the room

At this point I say to my self...""well i've never heard of a ghost actually murdering someone"" so i just say fuck it...put my headphones back in

This story is getting long so Ill wrap up the rest. The next day I tell my buddy about this shit and we are physically shaking the bed just to the intensity that it begins to make the same sounds. It was quite a lot and my friend was pretty scared at this too. We looked around the house for AC compressors and washer drier to see if anything was maybe attached to a wall and causing the shaking. We really didn't come up with shit. While we were in the process of looking around the house my buddies girlfriend said the couch she was on started shaking

As more and more people came for the wedding, but these fucks were passed out hard snoring, they didn't give a shit. Neither did I really, I was like fuck you ghost, I got my drunk sleeping posse. I just said fuck it and went back to sleep.

So one night late were back at the house sitting on the front porch in the dark, so this house right here is fucking haunted as shit by the way"". The girl serious as fuck poker face was like...""no shit, this whole island is haunted. dont you know they used to call this place graveyard island"" I had no clue what the fuck she was talking about, but I see in a gift shop later that week ""tales from graveyard island"" a book on the local ghost stories. Im not saying I saw a ghost for sure, but chalk that shit up in the fucking book of graveyard island tales.

So a couple months ago, just for shits and giggles. We were shooting the shit for a while and somehow the topic of psychics came up. The usual conversations ensued between family members, ""They're not real"", ""My friend visited one and she told him that ____"", etc.

At one point she started telling us of a psychic her and her family became close friends with, and all of his predictions were true, one would get married, another would lose a close relative, and another would get a great job, he even saw my cousin's brother's car and told my cousin ""That's your brother huh? even though she had never told him about him, and they had never met. Up to this point, I didn't believe her. Then she said

Well she got us intrigued and we asked her to tell us more about his friend. He came from a long lineage of psychics. She told us how he dropped everything and left his home in the middle east without telling anyone (can't remember where exactly) to come here. His family forbade that their ""gift"" be used for fun. His father, even though his son never gave his family any information. Apparently his dad disowned him after the visit, and they never saw each other after that.

My cousin then tells me one of the most bone-chilling stories I've heard to date. My cousin, went out for drinks one night. They came back at around 3:00am and were headed to their friends house to drop her off. On the way there, at a stoplight, they saw a man sitting on a suitcase. To give you a picture, imagine a part of downtown where there are abandoned building, brush, shitty streets etc. and the bus-stop was just a sign on a metal post, and the brush in the back, that was death. My cousin and her friend then shut up and got scared. The psychic then told them if they wanted to go back and see him again

(fast-forward to a few days ago)
My cousin came back, and it did. The psychic himself was hit by a bus. She also told me he had asked to meet me, because he had to tell me something.

1313626920.0,jm6w5,Haunting in Poland (x/post from /r/NoSleep),osamabinnavi,13,2,7,"I write this true story as a believer in the paranormal. I have my own experiences with the paranormal

A quick background:

I go to school in Poland (where this story occurs) and have no worries of people finding my information

Most of us students live in dormitories or apartments. A group of my acquaintances (one of which I am good friends with, rent a house. The found a real estate agent (there were 6 or 7 of them going to be living in the house) and were shown a house. It was the closest to school, and the biggest. The rent was too cheap, which Charles now says should have been a tip-off.

They decide to move in and spend the first night smoking cigarettes and drinking cheap wine. No problems so far.

The next night, they notice (from the house behind theirs) that there is old lady looking out her window at the house and them. This continues for many nights, all the while Mitch hides his feelings.

I must mention that when my friends moved in

As they begin to move in

At this point

Time progresses and Mitch begins to get paranoid. He starts accusing his friends that they are out to get him and that they are all convinced he is a ""faggot."" This worsens over the next few days and he eventually isolates himself completely and stops attending classes.

Everyone around him is worried for him and contemplate calling his parents back in the States

My friends go over to the old lady's house to try and find out why she is being so creepy. The language barrier prevents them from doing so.

One night all of my friends go out to a club. My friend Charles is the last to leave with another friend of his. They lock the door behind them (there was only one key among the 6 or 7 guys; strange, on the wall is a portrait/painting of the young girl who had lived there before. The painting was, when they left, upstairs, in the master bedroom. It had somehow managed to find itself on the wall, downstairs, placed sideways. There were no nails holding it up. They tear down the picture, and everyone finds another place to sleep that night.

Some of the guys, eventually, Mitch's condition worsens. He is now punching walls and yelling at everyone on a nightly basis, convinced that everyone thinks that he is a ""faggot."" He begins to hear voices. At this point, the guys all decide to call his parents. Mitch's brother was also attending a medical school elsewhere in Europe and was on his way home. He changed his plane ticket so he could go to Poland and pick up Mitch to take him home.

There are now 3-4 guys there out of the original 6 or 7. They return class one day

They had enough and left

Our speculation was that the old lady who lived in the house behind theirs was trying to keep a watchful eye on them as she knew that the house was haunted.

The stretch of road I was driving goes through the back end of a couple of counties in the Deep South. Nothing around but forests, so it wasn't really a big deal. Just a long trip. Since there was rarely any traffic that time of night (during the day you could always count on at least a handful of cars somewhere around)

And then I came to this bridge. Nothing really noteworthy about it - it's not ancient or a covered bridge or all that spooky. Just a concrete span over swampland

It was humid out and as the temperature dropped there was a little bit of fog. Not enough to really slow me down

And then I thought I was finally getting to the end of it, right? Guy walking in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. Probably lives nearby, probably drunk. Watch them to make sure they don't fall in front of the car.

But my mind is already racing. I mean

And as I whiz by going way too fast for my own good, and the straps trailing to the ground. Glaring white against the background of the night. No mistaking it. A straight jacket, hands covered, straps dangling and waving as he walked. Second. It has no face. Not like, there's no head there. There's a head shape. And the place where a face should be, but no face. Just an expanse of darkness that I took to be his skin.

I chalked it up to going really fast, surely I couldn't have just seen that. I tried to spot him in my rear view mirror, but it was so dark there was nothing to be seen. I slowed down a little, and was suddenly off the end of the bridge and on normal two-lane blacktop again.

I briefly considered turning around

But I still remember being my heart pounding and fear as I sped on through the darkness

It turns out that Gopal had decided to move to another village close-by to help them out with a few problems. Gopal was pretty smart and really handy around farm equipment and machinery, which was a bit of a disappointment to me. Instead of staying at his place with his dad, we ended up staying with one of my mom's uncle's, Viru.

We all got along great with my mom's Viru-mama. (Most Indian languages have different names for your four kinds of aunts and uncles. 'Mama' is your mother's brother,' too. His wife was really awesome, like a second mother, and her name was Sushila. He was really down-to-earth. His older son, Kalpit (about 32), daughter-in-law Jaya (about 30, Kalpit's wife), and daughter-in-law Prabha (about 26

We all got along well despite my brother and I being much younger than them, and Jaya took care of breakfast, now that Sushila was getting older. Since they had a nice sized family, everything was pretty well-managing in shifts and things got done easily, at least until some children came into the picture a year or two later.

Well, but something seemed amiss. My dad seemed to notice it first, but wouldn't really say anything. My mom talked to Sushila-mami the next day and then told us not to tease them so much. They had had some problems in that area, miscarriages and so forth.

Jaya was pretty skinny. She wasn't malnourished, and it seemed that this was the root of the problem. After we found out, we started to try to help by getting her to eat some more, drink more water and milk, and in general offer some emotional support. I got really close to her and she felt like she could confide some her fears and secrets to me, and over a few days she seemed to be in higher spirits.

A few nights before we were supposed to leave, out rang this metallic clang and hum. The milk was everywhere and we all turned to see Jaya slumped on the floor.

Kalpit and I rushed over and lifted her by her arms and put her back on her chair. Her head lolled. Prabha went to get some cool water and Viru-mama helped us move her over to the sofa

Her eyes snapped open and she flicked her arm away, but he was holding her down now, as was Kalpit. A look of sadness filled both of their faces. Prabha told my parents and my brother to check on me, and to stay back. Sushila-mami brought out a book from somewhere and Prabha brought some holy water (from the Ganges).

Apparently, trying desperately to throw off Kalpit and Bankim. Prabha started chanting from the book, tears streaming down her cheeks. It was a collection of some hymns, a few I knew from the Rig Veda, some parts from the Bhagavad Gita. I had started studying some Sanskrit at the time, enough to the point where I could recognize some of the verses here and there.

All through this

""SHHHHHHEEEEEEEEERRR!!! SSSSHHHHHHEEEEEEEERRR!!""

Like I said, even I could feel her intensity. Then I noticed her eyes.

Jaya, beautiful brown eyes. Only what I was looking at weren't brown. They were a bright, brilliant blue. Her eye color had changed completely. And in that spotless, brilliant blue, I didn't see rage or anger, I saw fear.

Then Prabha started chanting the Hanuman Chalisa, but she kept rocking her head and limbs back and forth, mumbling softly.

""The worst of it is over, though our Jaya wasn't back. I looked up at him, stunned, and he said, ""It's been like this since we started to try for kids. Every so often, she goes into these fits. Prabha's Sanskrit is good, so she chants some prayers

He dejectedly sat down. My mom, ""What is she saying?""

Viru-mama said

Jaya moaned next me

Bankim took up the story. ""That means 'milk' in Sanskrit. We gave her some milk, but was really different at time. It definitely wasn't Gujarati, and if it was Sanskrit, then Prabha would've known.""

""Sheer.""

I couldn't bear it anymore.

""Bhai, and I asked Prabha to stop. I guess she was sort of listening, cuz she nodded, but the kept the book open in case Jaya started a fit again.

Jaya stopped writhing and lay still

""I have to meet him. Please

""Dad, so as to be more ""Indian,"" but Urdu is largely Persianized. My ears perked at some of the borrowed Persian words, and her pronunciation.

""We're getting you milk. Who do you need to meet?"" I tried to respond in Hindi

""My fiance. He's at home and I need to get back. He said he'd come meet me in the city and he never came! I need to meet him, but more breathy. Some of the sounds she was making were definitely Persian. The way she said ""mulaaqaat,"" for example.

My dad talked to her and tried to get more info

My brother brought the cup of milk and gave it to her

""Let's help her up

Bankim and Kalpit basically carried her out of the house towards the road

Fuck

The dew was setting, she ran forwards a bit, pushing Bankim and Kalpit out of the way. She didn't even spill a drop of milk.

About 10 feet ahead, as if she were making someone drink from it. We watched as the whole cup tipped until it was almost horizontal, and no milk came out. Then, she fell over.

We rushed to her side to see if she was okay but she was totally passed out. We looked around for the glass

She came to a little while later

When we saw them on our next trip, especially with her 3- and 2-year old kids making mischief. At one point, Jaya and I were alone, and she mentioned that she had had some really vivid dreams that she only told Kalpit about, and another incident.

The whole family had gone with Gopal's parents to the next village over to see him. She and Prabha stayed home with the kids for a night or two

Jaya wandered around the whole house

""There was a cup, Prabha woke up. She never remembered anything, either. I guess I see why you were all so afraid, too.""

Then her 3-year-old ran into the room. She put her arms around him

1376056133.0,1k0wq5,[ME][FAM] Weird goings on in my old house,Morshy,14,4,2,"Sorry for the random title for this post but I wasn't sure what to call it - hence why I am writing it on here!  I have been an avid reader of this message board in the last few weeks

When I was a kid I lived in a different house to the one I live in now.  There was nothing particularly spooky about my old house, my sister and I have always felt that there was something a bit weird about the house.

We had a staircase that ran up the left hand side of the wall in the passage, leading to the upstairs.  The 4th step down was wide, as it was the beginning of the curve so was thicker next to the wall (if you catch my drift).  My sister and I both hated that part of the stairs, as always the entire staircase was lit pretty well, it just always seemed a tad darker than the rest of the house, like there was a constant shadow on it.  I also hated sitting in the chair next to the door in my front room, as in that chair I could turn my head to the left and look behind me to see that spot on the stairs through the banisters.  I also remember me being a really bad sleeper when I was a kid, but I remember it being a nightly thing for a good for months

Anyway, parents at work and my sister still not home from school.  I was sitting in my front room on the floor, leaning with my back on the sofa watching the tv, so was facing the windows out onto my driveway and the road.  I remember hearing a noise and looking up to see my sister walking down the driveway.   I watched her for a few seconds and looked back at the tv.  I heard her put her key in the lock, open the door, step into the house and close the door, then there was silence.  I didn't think anything of it for a few minutes, and when I got out there, saw my sister walking down it on her way back from school.  I freaked out a bit

My sister had a similar experience once too.  She was in the shower and we had all gone out, and my sister had a stack of school books in her room.  As she'd just got back from school, she spent time stacking the school books in height order onto her floor next to her chest of drawers, so they wouldn't fall over.  She did this, and then went and got in the shower.  Once in the shower, she heard a massive CRASH.  She jumped out and ran into her room to see the books all over the floor, like they'd been thrown or kicked.  She ran into my room, and obviously I wasn't there.  She instantly shit herself too

Apologies for the long post, I just wondered if anyone had previous experince with being convinced they see and hear a friend/family member, only to realise that it was just in their imagination or.. worse?  I didn't imagine my sister coming home, I saw her, heard her and anticipated her coming into the front room and she just wasn't there?

So here it is, and she likes to let people know that it is her place if there is someone in the house she does not like. 

When I first stayed the night there I spoke to her in a dream. But she was not like the woman in my last dream. In my other dream the woman looked just like you or me. This little girl was like the typical ""ghost"" You would see in a movie. Like think a ghost from the rift in Doctor who. More transparent and blue. 

At first I did  not know what was going on. This was the first night I stayed there out of all the times I had been there. And this was the first time I had seen her. She was sweet at first. I managed to gather that her name was lucy and she didnt know she was dead at first. I am still not convinced that she knows she is dead, wouldnt you ask someone to stay, too?) But she wasnt nice when I had to force myself awake. almost as if she was holding my hand for me to stay. ( I at first thought it was a weird dream and it was sleep paralysis, though it could very well have been, but everytime I see her, she looks like she did in my dream. Being it was the first night I stayed there, I thought it was a weird dream, things like the following started happening.) 

She has people she likes  that come by all the time (like my boyfriend) and if that person there she will as ""why"" or ""where are they"". She liked to follow him to the bathroom and what not when I first was getting to know him. She liked him a lot. But now is sort of hes there all the time

She will sit and watch childrens show or movies and stuff with me when I am home alone. Which I have never had before. But hey! there is a first time for everything. Sometimes at night I used to hear cabinets closing and opening. Dishes rattling in the kitchen, there were two lights She even remembers me turning off that urned back on in the house. And I told her ""oh, its the little girl in the house, I dont know why she does that"" and at that moment she looked at me and her eyes widened and she told me that she felt breathing on her neck and she heard it and it was heavy. She said she was gonna ask if a fan was on, but she didnt. But no, there were no fans on in that house. 

That is all I have for the little girl, anyways. I am sure he knows he is dead. But he does not want to leave earth, and for what reason, I do not know. I just know he likes to stay in the basement. He will reach the stairs to chase me out, it feels like if I am there too long. But that is it. 

those are the stories for the day and I will post more as I remember.

1371875562.0,1gu9fr,[ME]: The man with the hat,cihuacoatl,22,12,9,"Hello everyone in /r/Thetruthishere/. I had been lurking a bit in this subreddit before I decided to share some of my experiences with the ""paranormal"". I know this is non-fiction subreddit

First of all

I have always seen shadow people. My mom says that when I was a baby, hearing them calling me. I was also terrified of my closet because it was unusually dark (at least, I believed it was), but eventually, it all stopped around the time I was 8.

We moved to another apartment building when I was 14. The place was built in the 60's, even when everyone knew it had been abandoned for almost 10 years. As soon as we moved in, I noticed there were doors opening and closing on their own, shadows walking in the living room and strange voices in the night. It all stopped after a few months, and we lived without worries for almost four years.

I was 17 at the time we began having problems with one of the neighbours. She was a very problematic person, but here building administrators handle the money for all the needs of the common areas of the building: cleaning, electricity, employees, and so on.). In the end, my dad and our friend were cleared because evidently, the woman was lying

It was when the man in the hat visited me.

My apartment was in the floor level, and my bedroom faced her apartment. I caught her spying through the window many, many times, and I really disliked to know she could be watching me anytime. I kept the curtains closed always, and felt really uncomfortable because my bed was right next to the window, but since my room was really small, I could not move it elsewhere.

Well, and was trying to sleep, but couldn't. I stirred in my bed, eyes closed, for around two hours. Finally, I lay in bed for around twenty more minutes, staring at the bottom of the top bed of the bunk (I used to sleep in a bunk bed). Then I saw him. He walked right through the window, then crossed the small room

I lay frozen in my bed. I had just seen a man, walk past my room. I immediately started praying to the Gods (let me also clarify that I had recently converted to Wicca).

After a while, and I had a huge poster in my wall, just next to my bed. It was secure in the wall, with tape and thumbtacks so it wouldn't fall.

Well the poster fell, placed the poster back, re arranged the fallen stuff, and went back to bed.

It was no more than two minutes, I felt something bitting me between the shoulder and the neck. It was really quick, and I jumped out of my bed while at the same time I turned the lights on.

Evidently, but I was not. I was furious. I remember I felt like beating the crap out of that thing that had just bit me. So I yelled at it. I told him (pardon my language) to get the f**k out my house, that he was messing with someone who was not going down without fighting and that if he wanted to play, well, it was on.

In retrospective, and sprinkled the whole room with the liquid. Then I smudged the place with sandalwood incense, not missing one spot. I payed special attention to the window. All the time, I kept repeating to myself that the Gods were with me and that they were kicking this bast*rd out of my house.

My mom opened the door, but deep in her eyes, she was worried. She left, and returned a few moments later with some Holy Water (she's Catholic) and said, ""Well, this might strengthen your spell. Good night"".

As I said, the blessings of water in churches are so damn impersonal…) but I think that my mom's desire to help me and keep me safe was what strengthened my protections. I placed a glass with Holy Water, next to a glass with Consecrated Water, in the window.

The man never came back

That was the first time I battled something dark, sharp teeth sinking into my flesh. The attack left no marks, and it didn't change me in any way (I say so because someone asked me ""And did you turn into a vampire or something?” The person was pretty serious about this question). I know this thing was bullying me, and I suspect it was there because this woman (the neighbour) sent it somehow. Maybe she didn't even do it consciously, but it was too much of a coincidence that the man came from the area shared by our apartments.

As I said

I just have one question. Has anyone had a similar experience? Has something physically attacked you

1370049654.0,1ffvhm,[ME] Does this sound like sleep paralysis?,HoodedStranger90,11,3,13,"This has happened to me twice. I had read about sleep paralysis before

The first time was in December of 2009, I've long since corrected my sleeping habits), and the second I woke up, I felt something sit on the edge of my bed behind my back. Then I start feeling whatever it was shifting its weight on top of me, like someone was climbing on me. It kept applying more and more pressure. My eyes were open the whole time, but I was facing a wall and I was too frightened to glance up to see if anyone/anything was actually there. I never hallucinated or anything. It went on for no more than a minute before my dog barked downstairs and I snapped out of it. I was really creeped out, comforted only by the fact that I would be getting on a plane and going to Cancun that night and wouldn't have to sleep in that room again for 5 more days

The second time was in January of 2012, right after I woke up I felt someone or something get on the bed, this time approaching from the base edge. And just like last time, It felt like the person/thing was slowly creeping further on top of me, applying more and more weight. I also swear it looked like the sheet was bring manipulated above me, but that was likely a hallucination. While this was going on, I could hear two of my roommates and a girl having a conversation seemingly right outside my bedroom door. I tried to call out their names but I couldn't speak. After a minute or so, they both denied having been talking outside of my door and a girl having been in our apartment.

What makes these encounters different from others' accounts of sleep paralysis is that 

1) I was asleep on my side - most report that they were on their backs
2) I did not wake up with the weight on me
3) I didn't hallucinate (the first time at least)

When we got there, and we went into the woods. We were going to a clearing that had several strange stick formations that Kevin had been telling us about. On the way, we experienced some weird shit.

We all had the distinct feeling like we were being watched by... something. Then off in the distance we heard rustling. Now a normal person would think ""Duh you're in the woods. It's probably just an animal or something"", so Kevin decided to [try something out](http://soundcloud.com/ghosthunt/clip-2). After that we came across a few strange stick formations in the ground that were in the shape of an X. Mark, being the dumbass he is, pulled it out of the ground at which point Kevin and I started freaking out at him. 

Eventually

On the way back we kept hearing the same rustling sound and could not shake the feeling that something was following us. All three of us stopped dead cold.

Her brother said that when he was little he would see things coming out of his closet

My girlfriend and her brother have seen a man standing at their back door (which leads to their fenced-in patio) in a trench coat. My girlfriend said that they believe it is the spirit of a man who lived in this house and had a heart attack and died. We tried to do some ownership/property deed searching online and came up with no results.

My girlfriend also heard her name being called through the heating vent in her room when she was back in high school. She was on the phone with her friend Caree and it was loud enough to were they both heard it.

My girlfriend and I have also shared an experience. She was getting ready for work one day in her mothers room while I was sleeping in ours. She was using a makeup mirror and swear that she heard someone come up behind her. She thought it was me trying to prank her (I do it often) and looked in the mirror. She saw a shadow move in the mirror and when she looked behind her nothing was there. She also says that when she realized she was alone someone had been talking the entire time, they are always getting in our way. This noise startled and shocked me and when I turned around nobody was there.

When I was home alone one day, you really can't get more than 1 person up there. The only way you can get into the attic is from a panel is the room my girlfriend and I share. I was the only one home then and I had stayed in my room all day. Shortly after these noises occurred my girlfriend's mom came home from work and they stopped.

Before I write down the next one

An 'aswang' is a general term I think for any monster that roams the land to do evil such as eating or harming children. Usually it can be in the form of an animal that's strangely large, stuff like that). Sometimes, it can also be a person that turns into a monster at night and preys on children or people walking on the roadside alone.

Now

My grandmother said that there was a very rich couple that owned a mansion in their town. This mansion was in the outskirts of town near a large rice field so it was pretty remote. You usually had to drive through woodlands since there was no road to it. They had another lavish house near the town where they usually stayed. They never had children and never went to the city as rich people usually do eventually.

Every week, and the husband would leave his wife there. Then he would go back on the same day. The next day, the man would drive back to pick up his wife.

You'd think this was because she wanted to have a weekend to herself. But it was common knowledge in the town that the woman was an 'aswang' and the weekend was her time of changing. The people said that she had a room there where she couldn't get out and was left with carcasses of dead or barely alive animals to eat over the weekend while she was in the change. Whenever people saw their car (they were the only ones rich enough to afford one at the time go through the town

I don't know what's happened now to the couple

UPDATE:

Ok so I asked my other grandma who's a sister to the one who told me this story. Apparently there's another version of the story:

Instead of the husband taking the woman to the remote mansion every weekend

She supposedly gets there on her own when the change happens (she flies off) and in the wee hours of the morning you can see the car making its way to the mansion with just the husband. When the car comes back

It was an accepted fact in the town that she was like this and she rarely left the house. When she was seen,False,,t5_2sntx,1351141413.0,,,t3_120g5v

A few of my friends recorded several EVP sessions earlier this year.  They just posted some of the results online. Some are pretty interesting.

1344503346.0,xxjt6,[ME] I could really use some advice,siovannie,10,2,16,"So, apologies in advance for any spelling mistakes or weird words/sentences

I still live with my parents and brother. My brother works, so I stood up and walked towards it. The toilet is in a small hallway, leading to the front door. It's next to the entrance to the hallway. The lightswitch is on the other side of the toilet, next to the entrance. (Sorry if its a bit vague, I'm Dutch.) When I get to the hallway I hit the lightswitch, but just before the light switches on, I see a white..... shape just in front of me, facing the toilet. It disturbed me, which also added to my belief it was my mind playing tricks with me. I was still a bit shaken up though

I NEVER dream. I NEVER remember my dreams. But this time, it were Sam and Dean. I was thrilled; I recognized them of course, and when they asked for a place to stay I happily agreed. They would stay with me in my room (why, I don't know. My room is too small for 3 people and it's not as if my parents would ever agree for me to sleep with 2 boys in my room. But that's why it's a dream) So, when it got dark we went to my room, just talking. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/jnnPT.png) you can see the layout of my room. The circle next to the desk is my light, I always keep it on at night. The light faces the wall 'above' my desk

Sam quickly claimed my bed, asking him questions, stuff like that. I adored him. Sam was lying in my bed, Dean was sitting at the foot of my bed and I was sitting in the middle. Suddenly, I notice the light turned towards my bed. I freeze, and when Sam asks what's wrong I tell him. He brushes it off, but while I'm still looking at the light it starts moving until it was the way it used to be. I didn't see anything moving it, the light started moving like crazy, to get their guns and shoot the thing, and started walking towards the light while screaming at the ghost to fucking leave me alone

Any thoughts? I need to know if it was something supernatural or if there is a logical explanation for what happened. It really scared me

EDIT: please, I just want some advice. Downvoting me is fine, just explain why. All I'm looking for is some help explaining this to me.

EDIT2: Last night I had the exact same dream again, as I didn't really think about it at the time. I don't really know how to explain it, so I apologize if it's unclear. As I explained, my body was really hot. But I didn't have that warm feeling. I was actually a little cold, with my window open all night. Despite that, my body was hot.",,,,

I'm not sure if I believe in psychics
She didn't really describe the hat. She also mentioned that the woman who had that dream said that the dream happened three days before my cousin's suicide.

All of us have had our own separate experiences

It occurred about 3 years ago now

On the particular evening in question, I mentioned it to JW and switched spots with her so she could get a better listen. As JW was listening and trying to pinpoint where the noise was coming from, I happened to look down the street.

It's still hard to fully describe what it was I saw. But it looked like three figures coming towards us

Seriously though

We both just stopped and stared at the streetlamp in the distance. We were both compelled to keep going down the road, as if to say, “Over here”.

So being us

As we were venturing down the road

We brushed it off enough to keep going toward whatever was drawing us to it. And  as we were walking, we saw a dark figure in the distance about two blocks away. We just assumed that it was someone standing outside having a cigarette. No big deal. 

However, went down a side street and noped the fuck out of there. 

I kid you not, in which we wrote down our strange experiences in. So I was writing with JW, who was making sure I didn't miss a detail when something happened. I no longer had control of what I was writing. There was a white hot  presence holding and controlling my hand; writing in my stead. It was terrifying. After I got control of my hand back, which took a lot of fighting(JW and I both tried to pry the fucking pen from my hand it wouldn't budge and just kept on writing away), I noticed how distorted and strange the handwriting was and refused to look at the journal after that. 

JW says that the messages were very rude, and told us it wanted to make us scream. 

That was the only time we've ever had an account with something that seemed to have such malicious intent. And the only time that I've ever had something control part of my person.  We've long since gotten rid of that journal. The vibe completely changed and it wasn't a comfortable feeling when you went near it.

We are open to any ideas

Sorry it's so long winded
