EDIT: Wow thanks for your wishes guys! Some people have questions on the treatment so i'm posting my [forum thread](http://www.spinepatientsociety.org/forum/emerging-spine-surgery-technologies/ill-regenexx-stem-cell-therapy-guinea-pig-1149/) on the whole thing. 

A few answers to your questions:

* Stem cells are taken from bone marrow from both hips (the process is painful as hell).
* They are harvested for 3 weeks
* They are injected directly into the damaged disc using live x-ray.. it's actually a really complicated process and it hurts like hell!
* The clinic is in colorado
* I'm taking oxycodone to manage the pain after the stem cell re-injection procedure.

EDIT 3: Here's my [blog!](http://healingmyback.blogspot.com)

EDIT 4: I'm 2 days into my stem-cell re-injection. It seems that I have a couple of muscle spasms in my lower back (at least that's what I think)..

I'm sorry I didn't post sooner

I'd like to start off by thanking everyone who saw, and could have easily chosen to ignore the post.  It is because of you that I may be able to see my 20th birthday.

I explained the situation to a friend and she was able to arrange a friend of hers to take me to KC.  As per the advice provided, and scanning later, I have a diagnosis:

I have a brain tumor.

I didn't really absorb the specific science-y details he went over, based on where it is in my brain and other things.  I have been scheduled for a biopsy to determine whether it is cancerous, and I will post the results whenever I get them.  I'm not really sure about anything else that's happening at this point - I'm mostly just going wherever they take me and doing whatever they tell me to.

The doctor said that **I could have had an aneurysm at any time and died without any notice**.  He also said that, or muscle weakness), it could have metastasized before I found it necessary to seek treatment.   Again, I could have died tomorrow had you all not expressed such pressing concern that I get help ASAP.  I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay all of you, but I want to make sure you understand how much this has mattered to me.

Thank you.

Today I went to a new family doctor for a referral to an endocrinologist. I filled out the required paperwork at home and waited for my turn. The doctor came into the room, this doctor earns $2280 per hour for these first-time consultations.

Then we get into medicine. Insulin is a drug which cannot be made into a generic drug due to it [being of biological origin](http://www.dlife.com//diabetes/insulin/trecroci_122707). One vial of Humalog can cost around $300. My monthly prescription bill is around $300 with insurance. That's $3600 per year.

Once treatment was over, then came back again in December (almost exactly 4-weeks later).  Subsided again (never actually ""normal"", just down to 101F which is normal for her these days).  

Around Feb 2012, but was so physically weak at this point that she had to go to the rehabilitation hospital.  She went back to the regular hospital in Mid-March 2012 with another high fever.  Thorough investigation revealed no abnormalities anywhere, on anything.  No infection, nothing.  At the end of March the local hospital had exhausted all their options so she was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.

She is still at the Mayo Clinic and has been there for 3-weeks.  Her fever has hung around 103F the entire time, as well as repeated old tests:  lumbar puncture, CT scans, PET scan, multiple blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, MRI, EMG

They did a lymph node biopsy yesterday so we are waiting on the results, and even THEY can't figure this out.

GF is home from the hospital, Aspirin (81 mg daily), Effient (10 mg daily), Verapimil (80 mg three times daily), Pantaprazole (40 mg daily), Lipitor (20 mg daily-- should she even be taking this? Her cholesterol is perfect), sublingual Nitrostat (as needed), twice daily). Basically


She has an appointment scheduled on Wednesday for a different cardiologist in San Francisco. I'm going to mention both Kounis Syndrome and Churg Strauss. I'm also going to ask that he test her blood for c-ANCA and p-ANCA


Thank you all so much to everyone that responded! Any input is helpful. I'm positive that someone, thank you, thank you. 


**UPDATE #2:**


My gf asked her cardiologist if she would be able to apply for a temporary handicapped placard for her car, as well as a DMV application for the placard (a very kind gesture that I appreciate!). Here is his ""Patient Active Problem"" List:

* Degenerative Disc Disease
* Asthma
* Case/care mgmt
* Hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
* GERD
* Angina
* MI
* Eosinophilia
* Leukocytosis
* **Acute coronary syndrome** *(first time I've heard of this!)*
* MI
* CAD *(I assume this stands for coronary artery disease... is this the same as atherosclerosis? We were told that she* didn't *have atherosclerosis)*

I'm not sure if this is helpful

**ORIGINAL POST:**


I’ll start from the beginning. About two years ago she was diagnosed with asthma. She started taking Monelukast (Singular) supplemented with Advair twice a day, what she described at the time, as “heart burn.” Doctors told her she had gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and recommended she take OTC antiacids like Tums, Prilosec, etc., none of which helped much, I think Cipro. 


Then, and she complained for hours about a foreign-body sensation in her throat. She started coughing a lot and having asthma problems. We decided to go to the hospital for her asthma; it was then that she passed out in the admitting area. She had an angiogram and angioplasty. She was diagnosed with the following: retroperitoneal hematoma, GERD, prinzmetal’s angina, and hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [severe lesion proximal RCA—4.0 x 32 mm Taxus drug eluting stent expanded to 4.0 mm, spasm initially seen in LAD—not present at final angiogram, moderate inferobasilar wall motion abnormality with EF of approx 50%, Clopidogrel, and sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed. 


Since then, but not much (she usually has to take it 6-7 times a day). She has had her medicine changed back and forth each time. She’s been on several different forms of Isosorbide. Doctors say that her heart itself doesn’t seem to be a problem; the problem is that her coronary arteries are spasming and restricting oxygen to her heart. At one point it was suspected that she had vasculitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome), but since she can’t have a biopsy (she's on blood thinners), they couldn’t make a conclusive diagnosis. They put her on Prednisone anyway, which seemed to help for awhile, then stopped working. She has seen multiple cardiologists, rheumatologists, none of which understand what’s going on. She has had five angiograms. On some of the angiograms you can’t even see her arteries


We are running out of options and time. She has become lethargic, crying in her hospital bed because the pain is unbearable. I just want her to be the happy, healthy person she used to be… She’s in the hospital now once again and doctors are now thinking about retracting their initial diagnosis of prinzmetal’s angina because of her age. I’m lying in bed, home from work, feeling hopeless. I don't have any medical training, but I've been searching through a lot of medical journals the past few months, hoping to find something relevant or overlooked. I haven't yet. I really don’t know what to do anymore other than sit here and write this as I cry. 


Doctor’s of Reddit



**Other facts that might be useful:**

* 28 year old southeast Asian female
* History of smoking from age 17 to age 27 (quit before heart attack)
* Experiences angina every day, but her doctors said that would do more harm than good. 
* Stress test has always been normal. Angina occurs mostly at rest
* Current medications: Verpamil, Prednisone 10 mg, Aspirin 325 mg, Nitrostat (as needed), Proair as needed) , Advair 500 mg, Plavix. 
* Discontinued medications: Metroprolol, Famotidine, Pantoprazole, Diltiazem, probably some others that I’m forgetting. 
* Persistent cough that doesn’t respond well to asthma medication
* No skin problems observed
* No Raynaud’s Phenomenon
* No Barrett’s esophagus
* Kidneys and liver normal
* Most recent (as of yesterday) eosinophil count: 25%
* Lipid panel is normal
* ALT
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is normal


**TL;DR: MI in March with stent placed in RAC, dyspnea, asthma, unstable angina caused by arterial vasospasms, 5 angiograms, normal stress test. Getting progressively worse and not responding to well to medication. Please help.**

Last Sunday, but UCSF refused because they said my gf was not well enough for transport. Kaiser then agreed to pay for my gf’s stay at UCSF. Phew! 


The next day (she was admitted Sunday night), though. Vasculitis or ateritis were suspected. An order for a myocardial biopsy was put in (despite the obvious risks) to be done same day. The biopsy went well. After the biopsy was performed, Kaiser called UCSF saying that they would not pay for any treatment beyond the biopsy. My gf would either need to be transferred to Kaiser, or discharged. We opted to have her rest until the next morning (Tuesday), and then be discharged. 


Wednesday night we had to go back to the ER for chest pain. We went to Kaiser in Oakland, gf had a minor NSTEMI (non ST elevated myocardial infarction/heart attack) and breathing difficulty/asthma/wheezing. She was given intravenous Diltiazem and Solu-cortef and nebulized Albuterol. She was stabilized and discharged several hours later, at 5 AM. 


Thursday night, ever going to Kaiser Oakland again). This time for asthma only (no chest pain). She was given 60 mg of Prednisone and some kind of steroid in her nebulizer treatment. She had a number of blood tests done:

* **Neutrophils %:** 35  *(normal range according to Kaiser is 50 – 70)*
* **Lymphocytes %:** 16 *(“ 20 -50)*
* **Monos %:** 4 *(“ 1 – 11)*
* **Eosinophils %:** 45  *(“ 1 – 5)*
* **RBC’s
* **Platelets:** Adequate
* **WBC Count:** 15.4 *(“ 3.5 – 12.5)*
* **Red blood cells count:** 4.70 *(“ 3.60 – 5.70)*
* **Hgb:** 12.5 *(“ 11.5 – 15.0)*
* **Hematocrit:** 36.8 *(“ 34.0 – 46.0)*
* **MCV:** 78 *(“ 80 – 100)*
* **RDW
* **Platelets count:** 266 *(“ 140 – 400)*
* **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate:** 42 *(“ 0 – 20)*
* **CRP (C-reactive protein):** 0.3 *(“ &lt; 0.5)*
* **Rheumatoid factor:** 60.1 *(“ &lt;14.0)*
* **C4 Complement:** 37.0 *(“ 10 – 40)*
* **C3 Complement:** 130 *(“ 83 – 180)*
* **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):** Negative
* **IgE

She was not admitted in Richmond; discharged very early (2 am or so) Friday morning. Friday midmorning she had an appointment with her primary care physician in Richmond. Her PCP suggested going back to ER for her asthma, hoping yet another new set of doctors might be able to shed some light on what’s going on. She was admitted, given Prednisone, Morphine, and Solumetrol. Prednisone seems to help with her chest pain now (she’s taking 60 mg), but it causes her to be extremely itchy all over all day and all night, so she’s just as miserable as before.


It’s now Sunday morning


We’re not sure what to do now. Reddit

1331872048.0,qyy3u,Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a really frustrating illness to have. No quick fixes - but I want to share how I got over it myself. ,,159,39,139,"Hey, chronic abdominal pain, because every time I ate I would feel shitty (literally - bad pun) and sluggish afterwards. 

So here's what I did. I'll give a little reason for each thing. 

ANXIETY - a lot of people think IBS is just anxiety, and the way I went about this was getting my life in order and through massive amounts of exercise. Trying to organise, stop unnecessary stress. Counselling and medication, if needs be. For supplements, magnesium (muscle relaxant) and St John's Wort have helped me heaps already. Also valerian is an indispensable herbal sleep remedy and has turned me from an insomniac into a relatively easy sleeper.

PHYSICAL HEALTH - yoga, where you sweat considerably. It'll build up your endurance, too! To pain, discomfort, lots of things. 

DIET (this is a big one) - three major things:

1. Figuring out what I'm allergic to. I was already kind of suspicious about obvious things like gluten, cabbage. Finding this out and eliminating these foods has helped me get rid of the really spiky abdominal pain, though I still had issues with soreness and bloating.

2. Paleo. I have been following a strict paleo diet and this has possibly been the biggest help to me. Why does it work? I believe, and also they are simple carbohydrates that arguably humans weren't designed to eat in such large amounts. People may disagree, but the results for me have been argument enough. PALEO INVOVLES:

- eliminating: all grains (rice, buckwheat, quinoa, anything that is made into bread or pasta basically), starches (potatoes, tapioca etc - sweet potato is okay, however), because I only have it in small amounts and otherwise I would never, lentils), sugar (sweeteners

what does this leave? - meat, nuts and seeds, honey, tea and coffee. alcohol is not advised, but it's okay. In the end, these are delicious, under-utilised foods! Finding paleo recipes has been fun and surprisingly satisfying, is that you're eating delicious things that are good for you! No guilt

3. Food combining. It's difficult for the body to digest proteins and carbohydrates (like fruit) at the same time because the former process is very slow, not drinking with food helps! Water can dilute stomach acids and make a weak digestive system even weaker.

PILLS - there are two

1. Pro-biotic. I'm not entirely convinced that our heavy reliance on anti-biotics (and often not following the full course, but not powerful enough!) YOU MUST TAKE ONE EVERY DAY, with meals. Also diet is very important. Paleo gives good conditions in the bowel, because the bacteria aren't competing with the sugary, starchy, yeasty conditions of a bowel on a regular diet. 

2. Digestive enzymes - I cannot get behind these enough! These are amazing. These gave my IBS the last kick in the teeth, give these a go!

ANTI-DEPRESSANTS - through a gastroenterologist I was prescribed a mild anti-depressant that has been shown to alleviate basic PTSD. This was designed to re-program my body and stop the stress response that occurred whenever I ate. Some decent research is behind this

So, can get out of bed in the morning, and don't feel horrible about the day ahead of me because I'm so anxious about my symptoms. As a six-year sufferer, this has been incredible. I know it's a big investment for a lot of people, but ultimately all of these things are agitating towards a healthier life overall, and even better one without pain. I still don't think a lot of gastroenterologists are looking at the body holistically, or linking the bowel to other body processes that might be going wrong. Did you know that your bowel has more nerve endings than anywhere else in your body? That's a lot that can go wrong. So it's important to have an open mind.

Also, which has been wonderful) for 6 years. And in the end, talking about it and getting a conoloscopy wasn't too bad. Also, if you have more serious conditions it allows you to know definitively. Also for instance, if you have coeliac disease! Eliminating gluten is a very easy way to eliminate symptoms in such a case. So actually, you can get better results. It's important to pursue symptoms if you have them.

To wrap up (this has been a very long post), and want to see other people getting over this upsetting and difficult illness.

If you have any questions

 
EDIT: also if anyone needs to me clarify exactly what you can and can't have on the paleo diet

My GF started to first have gradually problems with speaking and started stuttering over several days. Then after going to doctors she started to feel disconnected and couldn't always remember details from conversations just a moment ago. She also says that she is unable to follow TV or read a book because she doesn't understand what's happening. She couldn't explain that any better.

She was initially given a medication for a minor stroke (or TIA?) to get the blood flowing based on the initial CT scan (they suspected it might be her contraception pills). However another doctor's opinion was that she didn't have a blood clot in her brain after few days and then they did the EEG

Now she is still feeling disconnected and having the memory problems and slight stuttering and slurring of speech. She also has some expressions on her face I have never seen before. The doctor's currently think it might be something psychological because she was somewhat depressed before the stuttering started. She is feeling fine otherwise and hasn't thrown up or anything and never lost her conciseness.

Can all these symptoms really be psychological? ",,t5_2qh9z,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/14nutt/my_gf_is_stuttering_feeling_disconnected_and/

Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune and inflammatory condition. As such

-Grains
-Soy and other legumes including peanuts
-Dairy
-Vegetable oils
-Eggs
-Nightshades (peppers, and others)
-Red meat
-Sugars



Excess omega-6 intake and chronic omega-3 deficiency provoke inflammation (primary sources are grains and vegetable oils such as soy, including vitamin D3, magnesium, digestive enzymes, and probiotics.


Eat lots of healthy animals and their fat
Get plenty of sleep.
Get regular exercise – but not too much
Get regular sun. (if you have inflamation you muscle supplement Vitamine D3 atleast 7-10
Don’t stress.

Some people suggest probiotic usage, sauerkraut)( to help gut flora*DO MORE RESEARCH)

Eating fibrous vegetables fresh from the garden, onions, garlic, and Jerusalem artichokes provide the prebiotic inulin (a type of fiber) which gut flora consume and convert to helpful short chain fatty acids. Olive oil, or coconut oil!!!!!!!! LOWER omega 6 oils, INCREASE FISH OIL!!!! Short chain omega 3 - flax oil. Its not as valuable. Not the same as fish oil. 



**Suggestions that people have made:**


-turmeric 3x daily

-I'd suggest reading the books Anti-Cancer

-Google 'gelatin arthritis'

-Ditch all artificial supplements in use

- Optional stuff: organic apple cider vinegar (in water

-floatation therapy

-look at plaquenil

-reiki treatments?

-colloidal minerals

-Search for YYYY's post in this thread. Very good link and information too

-PALEO DIET!!!!!

-Black Cherry concentrate

This is a throwaway account as I'm incredibly embarrassed by this. Basically, and laziness, I haven't brushed my teeth in two years. I'm starting to feel the effects. A few teeth hurt often now, and at first I thought it was my wisdom teeth coming in more, but I'm not so sure anymore. Also, on two of the teeth on the side of my mouth a little bit of the tooth...casing I guess? has chipped off. I know the harm I am doing myself and I have tried to brush them again but now I guess since it's been so long it hurts to brush them. What can I do to make it easier for me to transition back into healthy oral hygiene? I would love to go to a dentist but I honestly think I'm too embarrassed to do that right now, even though I know it would be the best thing. Maybe if I can get back to brushing and flossing regularly I will feel confident enough to seek out a dentist.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/r6t6f/havent_brushed_my_teeth_in_two_years/
