Hi

When I'm legitimate (not hacking) I'm a ~400 SPM player

We've all met hackers in game. However

I noted it's existence

I was on caspian

I was infuriated, and over the course of a few days learned to use it. 

Here's the information I think the community at large ought to know.

**The hack works by injecting some code into the game as it launches.** As such, and it loads it directly into memory and you launch the game afterwards. 

**The hack's capabilities are immense

* I can see the entire enemy team on the map

* I can see who is aiming at me at any time

* I can set the hack to aim-bot on the push of a button

* I can set the hack key-binds

* I can choose head, or variable shots, as well as no spread. 

* I can set the hack so that ANY amount of damage kills a player (no matter where the bullet hits)

* I can set the hack to spot all members of the enemy team every so often

* Finally

**They update the hack constantly.** It only takes hours between a patch and a new injectible updated version. 

The aim-bot specifically is extremely customizable: 
It can be set to only force aim at slow or fast or any speed in between on button press: It can snap to the closest enemy

There are many more options

So after I got my hack all set up, and began killing the shit out of him. 

At first, I just used the 3-d and 2-d radars, along with the feature that showed me who was looking in my direction, to avoid the enemy team, and just kill the hacker. 

He rage-quit pretty quick. This lead to my next finding

There are many

What I mean by that Is I found that on nearly every 64 man server

Here's how I was able to know (not surmise) that people were hacking. 

The hack can be set so that when you aim near someone (whether you have line of sight or not)

100% means that they are aiming at you, I could instantly see some issues. 

As you would imagine, who, once they 'took notice' of me - 
Could hold that 100% as long as they wanted. 

In other words, even as I ran, and changed directions. 

They were using their own hack to hold an aim on my head

But furthermore, the aim percentage would go from 0% straight to 100% - and not release until they had fired all their rockets/guns/etc. 

This also revealed very excellent players in some cases being accused of hacking, did exist. 

Another clear way to tell is if someone was using the hack, and what direction they are running and looking, at least some of the time. Hackers using the radar functions cannot be surprised. It was a dead giveaway

I did this for a month, or banned.

 But during the month

Here's what I've found- (and mind you , sample sizes and unscientific record keeping means these numbers could be 10-20% (maybe even more?) off. 

~~* If you are over 700 SPM

~~* If you are over 900 SPM

Due to comments and discussion I think this is a more appropriate way of quantifying this: 
* my anecdotal evidence is that between 1 in 30 to 1 in 60 players on big ticket servers are hacking. Also

* The vast majority of hackers aren't using most features of their respective hacks

* Moreover, and almost universally they would turn it off instantly. 
(example, and he would call me a noob, or insult me. But after that, the hack in most cases would be disengaged - and often the person would leave the next round.) 

* Most people using hacks, a reasonably good person (250~ spm or above) , given this hack, is absolutely unstoppable. I could easily go into a 64 man server, and have a KDR of 20-1 or more in that round, against even insanely good players. 

* Metro is a massive hotbed for hackers

I'm doing this because I want to convey to all of you the scope of the issue we face. 

Ask me anything about the hack/hackers in question. I'm not going to release the website 

EDIT: Formatting.

**EDIT 2: Post blew up. I promised I would give some screenshots tonight if it did
I've not forgotten about you all

**EDIT 3: Yes, I felt like what I was doing was in the interest of helping legit players and understanding the other cheaters/hackers/script kiddies.**

~~**EDIT 4: For those asking for screenshots: http://imgur.com/XXXXXXX**~~
That's 15 quid outta my pocket
Redacted

**EDIT 5. So yeah, some guy with the hack's website asking me to join IRC and making cryptic statements, I'm done. I just wanted to raise awareness about the prevalence of hacks in BF3, and I feel I've done that. I pondered turning the threats over to authorities, but i would rather just drop it all. 

To the black hats: I'm not joining IRC. Sorry. I fear retaliation.
To the white hats: As much as I want to help
To the people making not so subtle threats: Fuck you.

It seems wirrew is condoning this thread for now

*Here's the transcription:* **EDIT2:** Going to remove some of the linked post

**GUI Design Concept**

- [Here](http://imgur.com/sZCEv) is the Battlefield 3 SPAWN MENU GUI concept. (KITS, SOLDIER, VEHICLES &amp; CHAT)

- [Here](http://imgur.com/ogg0r) is the Battlefield 3 IN-GAME HUD


**Community Patch List**

**General Fixes**

- Fix the ”Black Screen” that occurs when spawning in or
- When spawning on a squad mate
- When revived, and to DIRECTLY move when you have stood
up(standing OR crouching).
- If spawn point is unavailable
- Add explosions to TV Missiles. ATM
- ENTER button during killcam will exit the killcam and take you directly to the spawn menu. You will not be able to be revived after exiting killcam.
- Enable more/deeper ground destruction. [Alpha version was good.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV2B59WxZ6M&amp;t=0m10s) **WARNING**: Loud audio in video. 
- Option for Command Rose to show up directly when ""Q"" is pressed
- Fix bug which makes you ""[lag-slide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSHIPt3olwk&amp;hd=1&amp;t=0m25s)"" when moving sideways using the PK-A(3.4x)(also on .44) or the Russian 4x scope. 
- Revamp the Command Rose sound layers so it's on the top for everyone.
- Add blinking icon to player who yell for ammo



**Game Balance and Gameplay (Infantry &amp; Weapons)**

- Increase the damage of the Javelin against both armored and unarmored vehicles. ""1HitKill"" against Growler ITV &amp; VDV Buggy. 2 shots = 80 damage against
armored vehicles(First rocket = Disable). 
- Increase the total amount of Javelin rockets carried both when using ""Explosive Upgrade/SQD Explosive Upgrade"" and when not.
- ""1HitKill"" against Growler
- Slightly increase the damage of RPG7/SMAW against the front of fully armored vehicles.
- Allow the player to use the SOFLAM as a binocular(mobile) when zooming(pressing RMB). And place it as usual when pressing LMB.
- Allow the player to enter his/her placed Mortar(again) without having to pick it up first. 
- Allow the MAV to JAM the Mortar mini-map for 45sec. Distortion effect on the mini-map when ""in"" the Mortar. (Still need to wait 45sec even if you ""reload"" the
mortar.) 
- Add a ""tip on screen"" for Mortars
- Give more points for spotting enemies. 20 at least.
- Decrease the time it takes for the parachute to deploy.



**Game Balance and Gameplay (Vehicles)**

- Make it easier to drive the EOD bot(turning).
- Increase the acceleration and top speed of the HMMWV and Vodnik.
- Decrease the armor on mobile AA tank. 
- Increase the reload time on heat seekers for mobile AA tank.
- Increase the spread of gatling gun for mobile AA tank. (So it's only powerful at close to medium range.)
- Fix the TV Missile so it DOESN'T bounce off targets or fly through other air vehicles.
- Damage from TV Missile against armored vehicles: 70 damage.
- Increase the splash damage from TV Missiles so it kills infantry within 1m radius. 
- Decrease the Lock-On time for Guided Missile on Helicopter gunner
- Increase the damage from Jet's Guided Missile: 80 damage against fully armored vehicles .
- ""1HitKill"" against jeeps with Jets guided missile.
- Decrease the range of stationary AA guns(Centurion C-RAM &amp; Pantsir-S1).
- ""1HitKill"" with tank shells against jeeps. 
- ""1HitKill"" with tank shells against air vehicles.
- Higher splash damage from tank shells against infantry.
- Add horns to jeeps(Growler
- (DRIVER ONLY)Add transport points(30) when passenger jumps out of vehicle(AH-6J LITTLE BIRD, KA-60 KASATKA, BMP-2M, 
LAV-25, M1114 HMMWV, GAZ-3937 VODNIK, VDV BUGGY, GROWLER ITV) . 25sec cool down before same person can ""give""
you transport points.
- Give the gunners of transport helicopters and jeeps hitmarkers. (UH-1Y VENOM, GROWLER ITV).
- More vehicles should spawn at flags in 64 player Conquest Large mode. 
- Add HMMWV and VODNIK to Conquest (Small &amp; Large) gamemode.
- More points for ""Driver Kill Assist"". (40)



**HUD Fixes**

- Add flag letter to both flags on minimap and on the minimap ""flag bar"". Also add A/B on rush.
- Auto zoom system on minimap that will match to the speed of your vehicle. Map will smoothly zoom out when getting up in higher speed.
- Repair icon showed on HUD in vehicle when being repaired.



**General Gameplay Wishlist**

- [Two man jets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhctTqHf7Y&amp;hd=1); Pilots have gatling gun and heat seekers or rocket pods. Co-Pilot have ""free-cam"" and can switch to Guided Missile or TV-Missile. This could be an unlock for the existing Jets. Like the CITV station for tanks.
- Exiting jet in air will use catapult launcher.
- Be able to do [barrel roll](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6o334KwvyI&amp;hd=1) with attack helicopters.
- ""Air Support Spotting"". RMB click in Command Rose on a ground vehicle/soldier will notice air vehicles with voice message and ""Strafe Run"" icon next to the
spot icon. Both air killer and the person who spotted will get extra points when the enemy or vehicle is killed and/or destroyed.

used weapon.
- Be able to send PM's(Private Messages) to non-friends on Battlelog.
- Be able to view ""My Page"" on the Battlelog forum. Here you can see ""Created Threads""
- Links in Battle feed should be clickable.

**EDIT** Made room for the word of Reddit!

- 1HK on all vehicles when using a Javelin+SOFLAM combo seems to be a bit much. It's already enough to disable fully armored vehicles. Perhaps today's patch tweaks to the Javelin+SOFLAM combo will be enough of a buff.
- Mod Tools. Still sexy
- How might the proposed UI scale for players that can't run the game in widescreen for whatever reason?
- The default faction pistols will not save properly in a loadout when changing teams
- A very interesting idea: should vehicle spawn points be more dynamic within main bases to make it a little more difficult to baserape?
- Full screen map: press M once for enlarge
- Console players need a way to exit a game at the end of the round as PC players do.
- 1HK at close range with snipers is still heavily debated.
- Adjust the HUD in some way so that floating objective locations don't occupy so much of your view. (Suggestions?)
- [Sort](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/n26q6/battlefield_3_gui_concept_community_patch_list/c35td3a?context=3) the available spawn points better.
- Add an easier way to exit a vehicle in a direction of your choice. Maybe based on the movement key(s) you are holding when exiting.",self,t5_2rlua,True,,pc,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/n26q6/battlefield_3_gui_concept_community_patch_list/

1345734937.0,yp5ye,Battelog Privacy NOW!,LevelCapGaming,2175,859,590,"So anyone who has been following my YouTube channel, and learning and sharing my knowledge. I have managed to turn my hobby into a profitable full time job which I am incredibly thankful for.  
.  
I have never particularly wanted any sort of e-fame or recognition
.  
One of these is flying helicopters, but once I have been online for 20+ minutes there is a good chance that the trolling is about to begin.  
.   
This got to the point where I had to stop making one of my more popular weekly shows because I simply couldn't get enough good gameplay to show to my subscribers. This show was posted on the main page of Machinima
.   
Many of my subscribers suggested changing my name. So that was the solution I tried. Using a random combination of uppercase i’s and lowercase L’s for ""IlIlIllIll"" can make it hard to search for on Battelog. This slowed down the trolls for about a day. Then it ramped back up. Someone told me they found me through players that I play with. Apparently
.  
This slowed things down for about two days. Then BF3stalker.com found me and put me back up on the site for all trolls to see. Someone messaged me saying they had favorited a Battle Report with me so no matter how many times I changed my name
.  
Others have suggested creating a dummy account. I really don't like the idea paying more money for a game that has made my job incredibly hard to do. Another issue with that is if anyone figures out my dummy account name then that's money down the drain as it will be impossible to hide it again.  
.  
Another suggestion has been to use my own server, it's extremely time consuming and costs a lot of money for a 64 man server.  
.  
Critics of my complaints about stalkers have said it just comes with the e-fame and that I should just deal with it. I agree with that in part
.  
Now
.  
And it's not just people with reputations. Anyone can stalk anyone. If a hacker decides you're his target for the day or week, but any player who has been stalked and trolled.  
.  
Now
.  
So allow me to try and appeal to the business side of things since I know DICE/EA can understand $ reasoning.  
.  
Ahem.  
.  
The lack of privacy on Battlelog is making it more difficult and sometimes impossible for people to promote your game. These people are often your biggest and most passionate fans, it has gotten to the point where I now dread joining a game, wondering how long it will take for a troll to ruin my game. I have even thought about trying to convert my audience to a different FPS game simply because things have become so difficult for me in BF3.  
.  
From a business standpoint
.  
We know that Battelog is designed to support the upcoming MOH game
.  
It simply makes sense.",self,t5_2rlua,1345735135.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/yp5ye/battelog_privacy_now/

For background, but other than that, it is completely silent.  In some cases, you will hear background fire from extremely far away, but the important audio of firefights near you, footsteps, vehicles approaching will be missing.  Background noises like breathing, and teammate comments are also missing.  
  
Rather than starting another one to complain about it, and it looks like DICE has acknowledged the issue, as of last month:

https://getsatisfaction.com/battlefield3/topics/audio_sound_bug

Since the issue has existed for such a long time, game crashing issues have 7000+ votes, and is still only on the acknowleged list.  If we can get more people to vote it up, it should get better priority to be fixed - right now it only has 277.

I have a rationale for this suggestion


Big complaints coming across the class balance issue discussions that Assault is too common these days


As it stands, instead you get a much more subtle reward: a permanent takedown.


How many times have you lined up a sweet sniper headshot from 500m away


Or how many times have you flanked around the enemy and took out a lone sentry with a silent stab to the heart


Or how many of you clear a choke point on Metro and finally think you have some room to push up to B

What I propose shouldn't break the Assault class: they can still revive people who die from body shots, etc. Just not headshots and knife takedowns... is that too much to ask?


BAM! Rush becomes more popular because medtrains can't just push onto objectives through sheer numbers and reviving. BAM! Sniping becomes a much more valuable contribution to the team effort. BAM! You are acutally using the knife's ability to be silent to some sort of advantage. BAM! The game becomes a bit more realistic...

VOIP:

If BF3 can have VOIP on Xbox and PS3

Battlecorder:

Remember Halo 3.  That came out in 2007.  Thats 5 years ago.  It was the first FPS I believe that had an awesome Battlecorder.  COD has had one for the last 2 games.  Again not sure how hard it is to code one

Spectate Mode:

This is an easy one.  Dice can make the incredibly annoying and stupid 3rd person after the fact kill cam

New UI:

There have been countless UI designs that should have been implemented very early on.  ""Hey but we switched the join button location"".  Not good enough.  UI implementation should not be hard.  How did the current one even get approved.  Something like 5+ clicks to change gun accessories.....retarded.

Please DICE.  You have made one of the best games ever but its lacking some major shit.  Please don't put an hour of effort into new DLC when you haven't addressed some of the basic issues of this game.

case in point, the most used class in the game -- i've seen matches were 20 people on my team were playing it. 20 people all armed with anti-vehicle weaponry that DICE buffed CONSIDERABLY in this patch (stingers and javs got huge buffs while the nerf to tank armor effectively buffs SMAWs). the result? a single engineer is fully capable of fighting a tank crew 1v1. 

let me say that again. ONE engineer vs ONE tank...and the engineer has a very real (and very good) chance to come out on top. two RPGs to the front will disable the tank, borderline ridiculous, and inexcusable. 

for console users, so that leaves 8 on the field, which probably mean's about 4-5 engineers. that is a very small amount of engineers to deal with a large amount of vehicles, so i understand the need to make an individual engineer more powerful against vehicles, lest the vehicles run rampant. but the PC version is 32 players on a team, WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF VEHICLES AS THE CONSOLE VERSION. thus, vehicles deal with ~20 enemy engineers on a team and each engineer is fully capable of soloing a tank or armor. where is the balance?

i am all for more people enjoying Battlefield but i am not for being abandoned and treated like a second class citizen. i understand consoles are more popular than PCs etc...but that doesn't mean my game should suffer. console game dynamics just don't apply to the PC game (unless it's 24 players). DICE has basically given a middle finger to the PC crew with these patches that basically push the game to infantry only.

PLEASE NOTE: i am not a PC elitist at all but i ask that console users refrain from giving anecdotal evidence in favor of the changes. my very point is that the changes are balanced for your version of the game but laughable for the PC version. two different game environments require two different balancing acts.",self,t5_2rlua,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/rm20a/dear_dice_please_balance_the_console_and_pc/

Here's my main argument:


- If a person wants to exit and do something else (different game mode / rage quit / etc)

- Games like COD4 allowed you to back out quickly.  It's just a small little thing that allowed you more freedom.  Minor

- I think it would help prevent uneven teams at the get go.  If people back out at the outset

****

***Preliminary:***

The objective of this series of guides is to take the weapon data from Battlefield 3, or for anyone that has a playstyle in mind and wants to use whatever weapon which will complement them best.

I'm going to split this up into seven or eight total self posts for a couple reasons. One, so the comments can pertain to each specific class of weapons.

Symthic's data is based upon the latest PC patch, the suggestions should still be applicable.
****
***Basics:***

In my opinion

**Recoil:** how much the aim ""kicks"" when you fire. There's a static amount upwards for each shot (vertical), horizontal recoil is a random amount to the left or right, and some guns on average pull to one side (usually the right) more than the other. Furthermore, each gun has a First Shot Recoil Multiplier. For most guns, it's around 2, meaning the first shot of a burst has double the recoil. Some have a high value of 3, some have a value of 1 which means the first shot's recoil is no different than any other shot. Recoil decreases at a different amount per second for each gun.

**Spread:** how big your reticule is (even while aiming, if you are aiming or firing from the hip, and if you are standing, crouching, or prone. Spread min is the spread your first shot will have (You can think of this as your starting spread), spread max is the highest it can get while firing full-auto. Spread increase is how much the spread increases after each shot. Spread decreases at a constant value per second for each weapon.

Other stats are still important

**Damage:** How much damage each gun does per shot. Does max damage up to a specific distace

**RPM:** Rounds per minute, lower is usually easier to control and thus more accurate.

**Suppression:** How much a gun suppresses the enemy per shot. Bigger guns suppress more

**Bullet velocity:** How fast the bullet travels. Since bullets drop at a constant acceleration, and thus better.

**Bullet range:** How far the bullet will travel before disappearing. Values seem high enough to not really make a difference

**Magazine size:** How many bullets the gun can hold.

**Reload time:** How long it takes to reload. Reloading an empty magazine is longer, watch your ammo counter to see when this happens.

If you want more detail for any of this
****
***Attachments:***

I'm starting here because I will be referencing the attachments in later posts

Note: Support gets Extended Magazine as a tertiary attachment. PDWs get flashlight and laser sight as secondary

**Primary attachment:** *Scopes:* Ironsights/Holo/Red Dot scopes have the quickest time to scope in, a glint that gives you away to enemies, and weapon sway that can be circumvented with the hold breath button. IRNV scope adds a virtual sandstorm to your environment. This is largely up to personal preference, what range you want to be most effective at, and what range the gun you are using is realistically most effective at.

**Secondary attachment:** Foregrip, or Straight-Pull Bolt for Recon bolt-action rifles.

*Foregrip:* Decreases horizontal recoil by half. For Support weapons, and reduces vertical recoil by a little bit. Zero downsides.

*Bipod:* For Assault and Engineer, and horizontal recoil is somewhat lowered. Note that the M60 actually gets increased horizontal recoil for some reason, this might be a bug. For Recon, reduces vertical recoil and spread increase, and decreases minimum spread on the SKS (it's already 0 on the other rifles when you aren't moving). Useful on bolt action rifles due to it eliminating scope sway. Downside is that the bipod sometimes doesn't set up when you want it to, and it sometimes does when you don't. (Pro-tip: If you move a little while zooming in, you won't deploy the bipod. Really helps to control when you use it.)

*Extended Magazine:* increases your maximum magazine by 50% or 100%. No downsides.

*Underslung Rail:* Allows you to attach the M320 grenade launcher or the M26 shotgun to most of the Assault rifles. While not necessary to use these weapons

*Straight-Pull Bolt:* Allows you to fire multiple rounds on Recon bolt-action rifles without unscoping.

**Tertiary attachment:** Flashlight, Heavy Barrel, or Suppressor

*Flashlight:* (Can be turned off/on) Blinds your enemies! Blinds your allies! Gives you away from far away if you forget to turn it off.

*Laser Sight:* (Can be turned off/on) Reduces minimum spread WHEN FIRING FROM THE HIP ONLY. Kind of blinds enemies, Recon.

*Flash Suppressor:* Hides the flash when you fire, you'll mitigate the downsides. Even then, I've never actually used this, as the upside seems way too minor. Maybe it's better than I think?

*Heavy Barrel:* Reduces your minimum spread when you are aiming down the sight. The tradeoff is that it increases your vertical recoil a little

*Suppressor:* This does a lot. On the plus side, instead of increasing it. It also does not reveal you on the minimap while you fire. The downsides are that your initial spread while firing unaimed is higher, and your bullets travel slower. This means you have to lead your targets more at range.  
Finally, and reaches your minimum damage at a shorter range as well. In effect, this only changes damage at midrange. Up close, you are still at your max damage. Really far away, you are at minimum damage either way, you just have to be better at leading your target.
****
Phew. I think that's it.

For my money, and suppressor to any weapon when I can. It's the all-purpose good at everything loadout, and I need a compelling reason to use anything else. But those exist! And I'll get to them.

There are 29 maps to chose from and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  Infantry only?  BF3's got your back.  Air vehicles?  Yep.  Tank combat?  Not a problem.  Sniper rifles, assault rifles it's all there.  Conquest, Rush, TDM, CQ Dom, AS, TS, Gunmaster

And the assignments.  I've fucking hated some of the assignments but they've *made* me try weapons I never would have tried and with a few exceptions I've been converted.  

The graphics are great, headshot guys on the back of quadbikes with sniper rifles (and I am a fucking terrible sniper), C4'd guys chasing me out of the East Door on Metro as I've tried to break for Alpha and killed the same guy SIX TIMES with claymores IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE LAST TIME (gotta love dumb bastards).  I've raged so hard I thought I was going to pop a blood vessel.  I've been shot from behind cover.  I've been killed by grenades when I'm on the red stairs on Metro and the grenade is above me and there is no fucking way I should be getting any frag down here.  I've popped flares and ECM and still been shot down.  Some ""hacking son of a bitch"" has headshot me from 3 miles away (okay, he had about 67 SS with the M98B, but still, loser.... ;)  )

And you know what?  I'd do it all again.  For all the bitching about nerfing and buffing and suppression and glitching and whatever else we've found frustrating over the past 18 months

EDIT:  The bit that really makes me laugh (and I should have added this in at the beginning) is that if BF3 was as bad as all the haters keep saying it is, listing it's numerous flaws.  If this game was as bad as they make it out to be then (unless they're masochists) why are they putting themselves through so much pain and frustration?  I suspect it's because even for all the ""faults"" this is still the best damn FPS out there and they know it, but heaven forbid they give credit where it's due.",,False,self,t5_2rlua,,http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/1b6ylp/i_just_want_to_say_despite_all_the_bitching_and/

**Second:  
This patch is the last thing that is to be accepted.  
A message to DICE: THIS IS NOT A WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS!**  
Enough is enough, don't ban me for this again.  

* Let's see what this patch broke and what could have been prevented:  
*Allmost all iron sights OR sights on snipers are absolutly broken
These snipers are affected:  
mk11, L96, m417 and the JNG-90  
The QBU-88 is a special case
*Video:  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS_3VbRHKYQ&amp;feature=youtu.be*  
* **Also the AUG is (again) broken.**  
This time with the m26. My favorite Assault Rifle and underslung are now USELESS.  
*http://imgur.com/a/mFDKm#1  (Screenshots)*  
* **And the last of the top of my head:**   
The completly broken Mobile Artillery Proximity Defense.  
Why did this pass QA for godssake!?
*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkodIjWclbQ&amp;feature=youtu.be*  
  
I'am sure that many Redditors know of this problem. (Since they are on  the front page.) But DICE hasn't commented on ANY of these problems.  
**This is unacceptable.**    
I thought DICE was in liberty of speaking to the community EA?  
If so
Why even waste the money on them if they don't have an actual job to do except from Twitter everyday?  
Hell you can hire me then!  
(I have a lot of respect for both Crash and Daniel Zh1nt0 Matros
Thanks for reading and thanks for possibly agreeing.  
**Reddit, unite. It's time. PITCHFORKS FOR EVERYONE!** *Let's get this to the frontpage of EVERYTHING INTERNETS. We must show that this is not a proper way to treat customers.*  
* **Demands:**  
* *Find a better QA team or make it bigger.*  
* *-EA will give the liberty to Daniel 'Zh1nt0' Matros and Crash our community managers to talk to us more openly and about everything DICE is doing (Only limiting to the games already released of course.)*  
* *-BETA Patch Servers, something like: Battlefield 3 BETA Patch Client.*  
* *-Working PC fuctions like commo-rose
We need a proper commo rose
Also a commo-rose on Xbox/PS3 would be very good.  
Squad Leader tools: Basic things as setting waypoint's, basic stuff. You did this before DICE, look at BF2.  
VOIP, which we have 3rd party programs for like Ventrillo, Skype, Teamspeak and Mumble.  
We need atleast Squad VOIP build into the game just like the consoles. I thought PC was the lead platform
     
EDIT Important: Basicly what we need is a no XP test server on PC
We just need to test this
We got 15 million FREE QA TESTERS EA/DICE. Wake up!


*EDIT credit to Mister Yayparties:*  
* **IN GAME PROBLEMS:**  
Sniper rifles that needs their iron sights realigned are: mk11, L96, m417 and the JNG-90  
When switching between co-ax LMG and shells, and firing a short burst.  
Some game sounds go away randomly and then come back. Examples[1]  
On Close Quarters maps you hear footsteps/shots/shoutings from over and under you as if they were on the same level.  
SOFLAM hitbox needs to be fixed especially when on an incline  
TUGS hitbox is placed too low and causes bullets to miss when aimed at the top half  
The Conquest Domination Flags' Hitboxes are broken http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaMbeS9GY8[2]  
The repair tool plays the igniting sound when pulled out but doesn't appear lit until you start to use it.  
Fix the Knifing dead zone on players using the Mortar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBSxvR02YpM#t=5m33s[3]  
If menu is displayed while waiting to respawn and are revived the menu remains displayed. (Can be fixed by pausing and unpausing.)  
When you equip the M26 Slug to the AUG
Tanks slide around on inclines uncontrollably (Never had this problem with BC2)  
Vehicle Collisions whether with friendly or enemy are very glitchy and cause rubber banding.  
Enemies vaulting over obstacles perform the climbing animation
When spawning after changing the attachments your weapon will not be visible and you cannot shoot for a few seconds.  
M320 Smoke can still be spotted through and does not remove spotted objects within its radius. (It IS possible because it was done in BC2)  
Claymores and C4 all disappear on death but should instead stay until the player respawns so that they remain when you are revived.  
Stationary launchers make a firing sound when entered but don't shoot anything.  
Stationary launchers consistently make reload sounds when not occupied.  
Teammates can indefinitely delay the respawn of vehicles by placing Friendly Vehicles where the vehicle will spawn.  
Vaulting through Windows is very glitchy and most of the time won't work.  
You are not able to spawn on your own spawn beacons unless you are in a squad.  
Your soldier will call out ""enemy spotted"" if you spot a recently killed enemy soldier.  
When you have the AN-94 equipped and you switch to your secondary and back to the AN-94 without firing your sidearm
The MP412-REX has a texture bug where the ammo cylinder and/or ammo disappears.   http://i.imgur.com/AfSjr.jpg[6]    
Almost every time I use the mortar there is no shell in the hand I am dropping shells into the mortar with (i.e.. invisible mortar shells).  
When joining a game with a squad of friends they get put on different teams or squads.  
Teammates appear as enemies with the MAV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXYYiL-aw[7]  
SOFLAM locks on to closer objects rather than those at the center of aiming reticle  
Players still aren't awarded kills for blowing up explosive red tanks near enemies.  
MVP &amp; Ace squad is awarded after 2XP is applied  
Reactive armor on the outside of the tank is not visually accurate but the 3 lines on the Tank HUD are.  
Proximity Defense on the Mobile Artillery damages the driver to 1% health.  
* **Rare Occurrence Bugs:**   
TV missile/Tank Shells randomly don't do damage on impact to vehicles. (15-20% of the time)  
TV missile randomly can cause the chopper to lose control and crash  
Loadouts sometimes change randomly for vehicles  
Sometimes the gunner dot crosshair doesn't show in transport heli  
Sometimes the 'repair circle' does not show when repairing vehicles  
Sometimes the javelin the target box doesn't appear even when receiving acquire and lock tones.  
Sometimes when killed in the mortar my soldier stays in the mortar looking out with the mortar map up. Can only be fixed by pausing and quitting the match. (Suicide won't work)  
Newly spawned tanks will sometimes not have any vehicle upgrades available (Damavand Peak Tank after the base jump)  
Sometimes when exiting a vehicle your soldier's gun makes a firing sound but doesn't actually shoot.  
Sometimes when reloading no animation occurs even though sound plays and the reload counter updates.  
Sometimes shotguns get stuck in reload loop without actually reloading http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6xy0SrlJI[8] (campaign video
Sometimes
In vehicles with Zoom Optics when switching between zooms (or guided missiles in jets) the animation keeps a super zoomed in view but gains the turn speed of an unzoomed view. Alternatively tank gunners when in an unzoomed view the HUD will appear shrunken to 50% in the middle of the screen.  
There is a little artifact in the bottom of the screen in the form of a line of ""static"" often (Also unknown cause).   Appears centered about an inch from the bottom and never gets close to the sides of the screen.  
Sometimes medals/ribbons stay displayed until you die reducing your field of vision on PC.  
Sometimes the music leading to the last ticket plays continuously through the round review.  
Sometimes when climbing ladders you cannot turn your soldiers head to look around.  
* **BATTLELOG PROBLEMS:**  
The M4 &amp; M16A4 are listed under the unlock progressions for the engineer &amp; assault classes respectively but not in the overall weapon statistics list  
The M9 Bayonet is no longer listed anywhere on the weapons page  
The Medals and Ribbons page aren't organized in any type of logical order or layout.  
MVP and 3rd MVP 10 Ribbons Dog tags are switched. (compare with the MVP medals)  
USAS-12 Proficiency Dog Tag shows a SPAS-12 with a folded stock.  
Note that all of the following stats are easily accessible on BF3Stats.com and yet are not shown in Battlelog under the T-Chart at the bottom of the Weapon Statistics page under ""Kills | Performance"".  
Neither kill assists nor target designations are shown for the SOFLAM.  
Number of EOD Bot Repairs are not shown. (However Kills are shown)
Neither Kills nor Repairs are shown for the Repair Tool.  
Number of Radio Beacon Spawns are not shown.  
Kills are not displayed for the Defibrillator. (However Revives are shown)  
Also check out INDGamers youtube QED playlist[9] for all the other BF3 Map glitching and Gun Exploits that need to be patched.    
EDIT2: Check out INDgamers mentioned above because they provide an ridicilous amount of game breaking glitches on their YouTube channel. They even got out of the map on Close Quarters AFTER it had been 'patched.'  
  
EDIT: Sitting down after 10 hours and 555 upvotes to fix this post. It's not really pretty. ;)

Jumping right in, which means someone shoots at you or comes on your screen suddenly, then you try to shoot back. In a game like BF3 that has a short time-to-kill and instant hit weapons (guns), playing a reactive style game is close to impossible. This is because the average human reaction time is close to 25ms, so when someone has a half second (500ms) initiative, you are at an extreme disadvantage. The only way to overcome the enemy initiative is relying on their lack of skill and/or your ability to process motor motions (aim) faster.

The common misconception is that elite players have lightning reflexes, which is why a casual gamer watching competitive players often think they have some crazy ESP on how to predict the enemy movements. The key to becoming a better gamer as a whole, is increasing your SA so that in any encounter, you will have a better initiative, forcing your opponent to play a reactionary game.

With that covered

- Map knowledge (knowing the hot/safe zones)
- Radar (simply knowing enemy locations
- **Flow** (movements
- Communication (player to player announcements)
- **Reaction state** (more on this later...)

Map knowledge is an often cited strategy

Radar is what separates the casuals (negative KD) from the real gamers. If you can master radar and you are not incompetent at motor controls, reloaded, then finished off the rest. If people are dying around you, be highly alert. *You know where to aim because you see where they will be.*

This leads to **flow**, a bird's eye perspective of what is happening on the map. Flow requires using the limited amount of information available (radar, onscreen) and attempting to understand which areas are hot and which areas are vulnerable. Literally, think of water pushing and pulling around the map and that is the idea of flow. Say on Metro, you hear two huge fights at the first escalator and side stairs, you'll know the second escalator will be the least watched. 

Casual players don't apply flow and can counted to stack with teammates to push a certain area. This means that flow is best applied toward flanking, when you do succeed, it will often be devastating for the enemy team and disrupt their position bad enough that your team can break through.  

I'm sure this is why the radio beacon is getting the nerf, things turn into chaos, where you don't know which way to look, what is secure and what not. Casual players HATE chaos and LIKE predictability, which is why they often stack with other players (especially at choke holds). Beacons add chaos to the order, so it really screws with casual players the most when it gets abused.

The MAV isn't a flow breaker per se, but good players get better with a MAV guy on the team.

The other best flow breaker in the game is the M320 smoke. I hardly ever see anyone use smoke except other high level players. The utility factor is twofold, which are two things casuals don't understand/are unwilling to do.

What other flow breakers are there?  Transport vehicles. The team can spawn on transport vehicles, which is what being part of a team is about. Who is the first guy rushing the MCOM with smoke that gets shot arming it but reveals the 2 guys crouched in the corner on radar?  Yeah, that's me, but fuck it, my squad now knows where they are and arm it for me. If I wanted personal glory, I'd go play 1v1 Starcraft or Quake again, but no, so remind myself to man up from time to time

Side note: One of the things BF3 hasn't had much credit is in the map design, if one area is dead locked, you can simply take another point and move on.

I've coached players before on the notion of flow and have guided players around maps where they slaughter players simply from getting better positioning. You don't always have to flank, the less often you get shot in the back and the more often you shoot someone else in the back. *With flow, you know where to aim not because you see them in front of you or on radar, but because you came to that conclusion logically.*

Now onto the second most important concept: **reaction state**. Unless you are trained in meditation, your eyes are already pre-scanning and your reaction time is also sped up. On the opposite side, if you are waiting in a room on the defensive and don't know when the enemy is going to come, it is nearly impossible to keep a high state of awareness, as you can only hold it so long. This is why SA is critical, because it informs your body when to be ready and gives you the initiative in a fight. 

Not only that, because by the time your opponent sees you entering a room, you will already have been in the room looking at him. I won't go into full detail on the mechanics, but this is also why you die after rounding a corner, why you SWEAR you won an engagement only to have lost and kill guys who go out of your field of view.

1349378170.0,10y94p,Lock on weapons in BF3,LyraAndBonBon,815,163,140,"Stingers, to speedy jets.

In my opinion

A solution would be to make lock time affected by other factors through a fundamental change to how these missiles function. Rather than a set range and lock time

* lockscore += ( heat / distance ) - weapondecay

This equation would run in a loop many times a second. While aimed at a vehicle in range

Three variables affect the rate at which a missile gains lock score, and a weapon specific decay rate.

* Distance - The rate at which the launcher gains lockscore would be inversely proportional to distance

* Heat - Heat is a value specific to the target. Lock on speed is directly proportional to heat. The hotter the target

* Weapondecay - This is a weapon specific value defining the amount of lockscore lost with each cycle. This number defines the relative range and lock speed of a missile. Lower values mean longer range and faster lock time, while stingers would have slightly higher decay and consequently shorter range. Equipping Beam Scanning in a jet would lower weapon decay, resulting in heatseekers with a very long effective range, with a very fast lock time against closer targets.

Now, while faster and more dangerous ones would have higher heat. Finding the right values would take testing, but the progression from coolest to hottest should go as follows.

**Scout Heli &lt;&lt; Transport Heli &lt;&lt; Attack Heli &lt;&lt; Gunship &lt;&lt; Jets**

This allows slow scout helicopters to get close enough to be effective

Other factors would come into play as well. For instance the upgrade ""Stealth."" Rather than increasing lock time, and shorter effective range.

Besides its normal effect of preventing locks from heatseekers, heat would be reduced by an amount inversely proportional to your altitude. Essentially below radar would be a stronger version of the new stealth while active, increasing lock time, and reducing range. This allows a heli a few hundred meters away to escape a stinger by dropping low, but allows the stinger to remain effective against nearby helicopters.

Finally using afterburners would increase a jet's heat. This would make it harder for a jet to speed out of range by hitting afterburners

---

Other restrictions would need to be added to make the system work, but I believe a system like this is the best chance we have of seeing balanced stingers and heatseekers in BF3.

One size fits all ranges and lock times simply don't work. The system needs flexibility to allow missiles to function correctly against the different types of vehicles on a wide variety of maps.

1344943273.0,y74gm,For the interested: G3 from a real life experience perspective.,nOcsy,800,160,215,"Hey guys.

I know it's not the most popular weapon of choice in Battlefield 3

A little backstory: The Norwegian Armed Forces used the AG3 (our version of the G3A3) as the standard assault rifle up until 2007, more specifically KFOR 8 in the QRF (Quick Reaction Force).

Now, although there was a lot of hate involved in hauling this beast around, once you get into an open firing situation there are few things you'd rather have on your side and it's almost like you want to apologize to the rifle for cursing its weight. With the 7.62mm rounds this thing will eat through a centimeter of armored steel, so unless your enemy had proper cover you could pretty much just fire in their general direction. You're either going to hit them through whatever they are hiding behind, or suppress them significantly (We also used the MG3 for suppression, that's ~~900~~ 1200 RoF with 7.62mm); obviously the return fire was next to non-existent. I remember during a NATO winter exercise in northern Norway, we swapped rifles on the shooting range with some American marines, they renamed the AG3 to ""The Hand Cannon"". There was one situation a little later in Pristina where the stopping power of the G3 prevented a lot of havoc

Due to this, it is very accurate mostly due to its inertia and long barrel. In fact we've used [zoom optics on the G3 with great success](http://i.imgur.com/43rkc.jpg). 2. Firepower - As we said, a bigger gun and a larger caliber will provide more punch. Lastly, 3. Something we noticed on regular city patrols is that it is quite intimidating. It's not a big point to address, but the moral behind a lot of military tactics is the perception of authority and intimidation. I can address this further if anyone is curious.

Ok, the weight/size wasn't inherently negative). 

Something that's not part of BF3 is weapon jamming, and this is a big deal breaker in a lot of situations! This gun will probably fire regardless of what you've dragged it through. Also, the durability is very good. It's hard to break something on the G3 and assembly/disassembly is simple and fast. I have little experience with the standard stock as we used a retractable steel stock (To suit the space requirements of being in armored vehicles), but the few times I tried it, it seemed fine. The iron sights are also excellent.

However

In close quarters for instance, and in this case the weight will slow you down considerably. (which is funny, because in BF3 CQ it's quite good!) 

There's also the case of recoil. Now, it's scaled down pretty good. This rifle kicks you like a mule. I mean, I've had a blue shoulder from this thing, and if you don't know how to aim properly with the iron sights, it's going to kick you right in the eye. This makes the full auto setting useless. There is more or less no situation where you want to spray this rifle. MAYBE if you're cleaning up a foxhole, but even then I'm sure it's more effective to use single-fire. 

Mag size. It only holds 20 rounds, but it added even more weight to an already heavy weapon, and it changes the center of gravity of the gun slightly, so it took a little getting used to. We also put tracer ammunition in the bottom 3 rounds of every magazine whenever we had a real operation, so that if you lost count of how many bullets you had left in the mag, you knew you should switch when you saw the gun fire tracers. This saved you from a full reload.

All in all, I still think it's one of the best rifles ever made.

Nearing the end now (I promise!). I'd like to discuss some of the differences from real life G3 to BF3 G3. I've read a lot about how people don't like the sound of it -- Although I don't know specifically why they don't like it, and here's some [audio from the Norwegian AG3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr14_2Z2m0A). They got the rate of fire correct though. It's around 550 RoF.

Also, because it would be easy to add it, but I think there might be a copyright barrier with Heckler &amp; Koch, as a lot of their guns are called the M*, but in the weapons description they are referred to as being produced by ""A famous German weapons manufacturer"". It kinda sucks, because a HK79 attachment would complete my nostalgia in the game, even though it's not that popular to get hit with.

Anyways, RDS, or holo, with just a heavy barrel. It really performs well in all situations and ranges once you get used to it.

   Thank you. thank you for being there for me. Thank you for not jumping out the first time a missile locks on to our tank. I appreciate your candor. Thank you for trusting me when I start going the opposite way of the point. You realize I'm flanking the enemy and setting you up for a kill streak. You, steadfast gunner. 

You are unlike the rest. Your not just hitching a ride to the next point or using me so you don't die in the hail of bullets around us. No. You are in it to be my gunner, I can count on you to have the decency to put your life on the line to repair it for me since you did me a courtesy and picked engineer class. 

I guess what I'm trying to say Gunner is that, Tonto to my lone ranger. I sit in my throne of steel pounding away at the enemies' encampments while you faithfully, patiently, await our next move. You don't fire off rounds at ghosts and always spot the enemies. Hell, you even changed your perks before you spawned in so that we would have radar when you hopped in.

Your modesty and resolve inspire me gunner. I just wanted to let you know that.

****

***Assault:***

**AK-74M:** Russian starter weapon - This is the first weapon for the Russian side, and not even a good kind of average. If you want a good all-around rifle, look at the next three options.  

**M416:** Better than junk? - Beats the AK-74M in every discernable way, lower recoil. Notable for having a good first shot recoil, so your follow up shots will be pretty accurate.  
However

**M16A3/A4:** Best(?) all-around rifle - (The M16A3 is the American starting weapon, while the A4 has a three-round burst instead.) While this has a little higher first shot recoil than the M416, the M16 boasts a higher firerate, higher bullet velocity, fastest Assault reload speed, and lower sustained vertical recoil. The only weakness is that you have to fully rank up the Assault class to unlock the A3 version for the Russian forces. With the right attachments (and there are no wrong ones), this rifle can be set up to be effective in any situation. Note: If using the red dot or holo sights, and blocking enemies at worst.

**AEK-971:** All-around alternative, until Back to Karkand.) Considering it has one of the best vertical recoils of any Assault rifle, the AEK-971 is great at close to mid-range, and is usable in very short bursts at long-range if the need arises. It has three significant disadvantages when compared to the M16: One, it has a lower bullet velocity, making it not as good at range. Two, it has a reload time that's almost an entire second longer, it has really high horizontal recoil
However

**KH2002:** All around great, even though I usually dislike weapons with a burst-fire mode in place of full-auto. Reason being, the vertical recoil is so incredibly low, the three-round burst can be used to pick off targets at range or just spammed at close range without a problem. It also has a good firerate, good bullet velocity, and uh, the worst reload speed outside of the Support LMGs. There's also this weird issue where since the rifle technically holds 31 rounds, and will take longer if you reload from empty

**G3A3:** Long range, it does more damage per shot (5 at close range, 3 at far), balancing the damage per second out to comparable levels, and favoring those who prefer single-shot or short bursts (this also make it able to one-hit headshot kill players at close range on hardcore). This rifle also has a smaller initial spread WHILE NOT MOVING, but a higher spread increase per shot when compared to any other Assault rifle, making single shots much better than full-auto. Recoil is also high, so be careful in close range engagements. The bipod for this weapon reduces vertical recoil more than for other Assault rifles, and it has a 20 round magazine instead of the standard 30

**AN-94:** Long range, one more apparent than the other. One, it has a two-round burst feature. Two, unlike every other's weapon first shot recoil multiplier being 1 or greater, the AN-94's is .67, making its first shot's recoil about equal to other rifles' sustained recoil. However the sustained recoil is pretty bad, so be careful about long bursts. Otherwise, just with much lower RPM. If you aren't using the two-shot burst on this rifle

*Special note:* Heavy Barrel for the G3A3 + AN-94 - What makes these two weapons exceptionally good for long range, the heavy barrel reduces half the initial spread when aiming down the sight, but for these two rifles, it removes %100 OF THE SPREAD for the first shot. Even while moving and aiming, the heavy barrel provides pixel-perfect accuracy, something no other weapon in the game achieves while on the move. With a little luck concerning the spread, the AN-94's second bullet can land exactly where the first did
Speaking of close-range...

**F2000:** Run 'n' Gun - This rifle's first shot recoil is absolutely horrible, It's minimum spread while moving and/or firing from the hip is lower than any other rifle. You are able to fire three to five bullets before your spread gets to a point equal to the other rifles' initial spreads in the same situation. I'd use a suppressor to help control the recoil if you plan to mainly aim and firing while moving. If you plan to fill people full of holes without aiming at all, I'd go with a laser sight to keep it as accurate as possible. The horizontal recoil is almost as bad as the vertical, a foregrip is highly suggested. Bipod + Laser would make for a ridiculously strange combination that just might be awesome. The F2000 has a high firerate, but a high reload time, so either get good with your sidearm, or good at clearing out squads in one magazine.

****

***Assault

**FAMAS:** Extremely high damage at extremely close range - If you haven't heard, it also has the worst reload time of any Assault rifle, the worst horizontal recoil, a mediocre vertical recoil, a higher initial spread when aiming down the sights, and a slower decrease of recoil over time (changing this value is kind of the ""theme"" of weapons in BtK). On the one hand, I'll be surprised to see all these downsides make up for a higher RPM, in close range where spread and recoil don't matter

**L85A2:** Short/Mid-range tactical rifle? - So this rifle has a reload speed, and it's RPM is a third less. So what redeems this rifle? One, like the F2000, it has a lower minimum spread while firing from the hip and/or moving. Two, it has a very respectable verticle recoil. Three, and what may be the important part, is that the effects of recoil reduce per second faster than any other Assault rifle. My interpretation of this data is that the L85A2 is meant to by used as a series of quick three-shot bursts at mid-range, it's probably best to fire from the hip

I gave it some more thought, you'd be able to recover after a few seconds.

This would do a couple things:  
1. End circlejerk dogfighting and force pilots to use new evasive maneuvers  
2. Make gun runs more deliberate

Of course

What do you guys think?

The most important thing with any server is that it provide a quality gaming experience for its players.  So we'll have an active roster of mature admins (actively managed to cull out any bad seeds that creep in), etc.

Since the hardest part of getting a new server going is actually attracting a critical mass of players


All that said

* I have more money than time, etc.), promotional programs, maybe recruiting &amp; managing volunteer admins, and whatever else is needed.  It's modest pay, but damn cool work!  If you are interested, [PM me your *e-mail address* (not reddit username) here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jhogan&amp;subject=Server) and I'll respond off-reddit with details on an application process.  Feel free to propose a higher rate.

* Feedback!  What else would you like to see on your ideal server?  (Assume that ""vanilla game settings"" and ""full map rotation"" are non-negotiable) :-)  And how can we build a strong BF3/reddit community on the server?

* EDIT:  We will need some volunteer admins as well!  i.e. people who can hang out playing on the server, non-power-trippy types, please [PM me your *e-mail address* (not reddit username) here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jhogan&amp;subject=Admin) if you'd like to be notified when opportunities are available.

I would love to have this server up and running within a week


EDIT: Probably clear from context

EDIT 2:  Given that ""CQ"" means ""Conquest""

EDIT 3: OK, and continue to let me know if you are interested in the server manager or volunteer admin positions.  Thanks to all of you for your encouragement and support.

1. Moved AA on Kharg (US on Carrier
1. Faster vehicle spawn (I mainly noticed air) 
1. Shorter game start countdown
1. Much better responsiveness (Even better with AA turned off)
1. You can fly through all poles from testing with jets and little bird so far. (EDIT Only the top breaks
1. Can spawn into AA guns (People actually use them now)
1. **Improved sound EDIT: Can hear footsteps, I could hear footsteps and reloading from next room.
1. I think console sound cutout is fixed (EDIT: Reports that it isnt)
1. Uninstalls B2K and forces you to re download (PS3 thing I think)
1. Custom Servers (AU Pricing, also has 1 day option and some others)
1. Match Making option in multi player
1. Reset some of my kit customisations
1. Many Many small UI tweaks, flags)
1.     Icons for vehicles on spawn screen
1.     Easier to see what spawn point is selected on map when selecting spawn
1.     No blind colour mode
1. Jets guided missiles are actually useful and can take out a tank and nearby infantry (runners from tank) in 2-3 hits tops)
1. *Stinger takes about 2-3 seconds to lock onto and fire, I forsee a lot of heli's flying with ECM or Maintenance in future, range is greatly reduced but enough to keep helis off a flag and nearby area. EDIT: Lock on is UBER Fast, like seriously must be less then 2 seconds, Below radar has been buffed, I forgot about rpg's though and got 1 hitted.
1. Can quit between rounds
1. Havoc is noticeably easier to fly but I still don't think its on par with Cobra
1. **Other squad leader objectives are marked on flags, this is awesome!
1. Laser marker or maybe guided missile range seems to have been increased

1. Dno if its me but there seem to be slight camera and animation changes
1. (LatrellSwisher) Additional Dogtags have been added (A-91 and M26 dog tags. As well as a tag for the game 'Syndicate') 
1. Slight graphic tweaks
1. All air vehicles now start with flares as a minimum 
1. No minimum player count
1. Red Laser designator can be seen from tanks and heli's as well as SOFLAM's now. 
1. Added ladder to Sharqi tv tower (Keep eye out for other map tweaks)
1. Separate customisations for US and RU now
1. Numerous changes to ribbons and medal requirements (see comments below)
1. Driver Kill assist increased
1. Added a littlebird to attackers on rush for sharqi
1. Tank added earlier to bazaar rush for attackers
1. Lot more recoil added to most guns
1. Greater suppressive effect
1. Jet guns do less damage so dogfights are a bit more interesting now
1. ECM might be buffed
1. Damavand Peak Rush. Attackers get 2 Jeeps instead of previous one
1. (mental_disorders) Additional Attachments/Unlocks: M27 IAR + QBB-95 + SKS has a Heavy Barrel MG36 + AS-VAL has extended mags 
1. Last 2 squads have been hidden (Squad menu cleaned up as well)  so only 4 squads available
1. Can invite people to squads
1. Higher ticket servers and other server variations (custom servers and official)
1. (the-knife) Battlelog now (with the new browser update) automatically updates the ""Upcoming Unlocks"" list when a new battle report arrives.

1339491933.0,uxoqm,Tentative future update Balance changes and Fixes,Demize99,731,175,982,"Here is a list of potential fixes for a future update. I've been scouring the feedback from Battlelog, this is not exhaustive

Additionally, however the update only changed how a the assist helps a player stay on a moving target not how aim assist works when zooming. Further more the videos players have shown attempting to show zoom spamming as a valid tactic fail to actually get the crosshairs on target, as the system is designed to only assist the player and the player will need to do the rest.  In fact the videos demonstrate a system which accomplishes exactly what it is designed to do.  Finally, some players have worried about quick scope snipers using zoom spamming, however high zoom scopes on all weapons prevent this tactic by not including any zoom assist, the player has to do this skill shot on all his own. I recognize this is a hot topic for highly skilled players, and I feel currently the new aim assist settings provide enough assistance to players without eliminating the skill element.


On to the Changes:

* A number of weapons have had their reload timers adjusted to better fit their animations and gameplay balance. For most of these weapons the gameplay timers were slightly out of sync with the actual reload animation, F2000, FAMAS, KH2002, MK3A1, JNG90, MG36 QBU-88, Pecheneg
* Short and Long reload reduced: SCAR-L, AN-94, AK-74, PP2000, G3A3, SKS, MG36, MK3A1
* Long reload reduced: AUG A3, Pecheneg, L85A2, QBB-95, M1911, MP7, M4A1
* Short reload reduced: FAMAS, PP-19, QBU-88;
* Short and long reload increased: ASVal
* Long reload increased: P90


* Belt Fed Machine guns are now more accurate when standing and firing while aiming: M240, and Pecheneg
* Increased the close range damage of the UMP but reduced its damage over range. The UMP now has a sweet spot in CQB but suffers compared to the PP2000 at longer ranges.
* Increased the long range damage of the PP2000 to highlight its role as a mid-range
* Increased the min damage of the M1911 to make it fit better between the Magnums and the M9/MP443
* Reduced the M93R's damage and range
* Increased the fire rate and reload time of the MP412 REX to better highlight the improved CQB performance over the 44 Magnum.
* SG553: Horizontal recoil reduced to help make this weapon more controllable.
* MG36: Vertical recoil reduced to make this weapon more controllable.
* M416: Vertical
* 44 Magnum: Rate of fire reduced slightly to highlight this sidearm's role as a slow firing heavy hitter and differentiate it from the MP412 REX.
* M16A3: Recoil amounts slightly increased.
* M4A1: Recoil amounts slightly increased.
* G36: Vertical and First Shot recoil amounts reduced.
* The bonuses provided by a number of bipods have been increased: F2000, M416, Pecheneg, Type88, FAMAS, MG36
* Added Burst Fire to the M5K as an available option.
* Slightly reduced the range bonus added by the heavy barrel on the 5.56mm
* Slightly reduced the range penalty for the suppressor on 5.56mm, Carbine, and LMG.
* Slightly reduced the range penalty for the suppressor on the SCAR-H.
* The radius for maximum damage of the 40mm LVG has been slightly increased. The overall damage level and range remain the same.
* Fixed the SCAR-L heavy barrel not increasing recoil when zoomed and standing.
* Fixed Jets not getting bonuses on Laser Designated targets.
* Fixed the AUG’s M320 smoke having an incorrectly high projectile velocity.


* Fixed helicopter weapons being unable to destroy equipment with splash damage.
* Increased the damage helicopter and jet rockets do to helicopters and jets and infantry.
* Increased the damage helicopter gunners and IFVs do to helicopters and jets.
* Slightly increased the damage of the AA vs infantry

A lot of people have been asking me what the point of Platoons is. Well the way I see it is they add another layer of competition to the game. You can play in the same squad with all your mates but battlelog never lies on who contributes the most

Yes there are issues with the main game and GFX drivers etc. but they will be fixed and patched soon enough im sure.

Gulf of Oman is beautiful.  The unexpected city CQC is amazing - especially with the heightened sense of destruction these maps give.

I only got one Assignment unlocked last night - ""Fixing It"" but the variety of gameplay that's forced by trying to unlock these assignments is awesome.  Killing people with a blowtorch is kinda tough.

Anyway

PS : I'd like to see a future map pack released with more OP-Metro style CQC for variety... ;) New York?  It'd be awesome to make a map that plays like CS:S on the Frostbite2 engine.

You were silent, or a rock. You even tried shooting at people once, remember? Remember, on Gas Station,  how you tried shooting the enemies tank, and he spotted us, because of that? And the C4 guy
We had such a great time together, in our small cosy tank.  
In the open between the Antenna and the Control point, even if you were a bit slow. Remember? The good ol' days. Even though they were harsh, we managed to stay at the top of the scoreboard.  
But then, you and i, with our teams  Tunguska standing near the stationary AA. Remember? I do, I recall it every night before I go to sleep. And... sorry for the bad handwriting, it's an emotional memory for me... you were shooting the tank that was halfway on the map.  When you noticed the chopper, and bailed.  
I yelled, alone, in the open of the Control Point. One, against the chopper, with no chance of escaping.  
I had to take you'r seat. Your seat, and shoot at the helicopter. It was tough, Ii had to get out, and repair the tank, while the chopper wasn't firing at me, 10% at a time. Then going back to you'r place, to try and kill it.  
In the end, but to fear, and the feeling of impotence.  
After the battle, i tried asking a few snipers, but the only thing i got in response was ""OMG A TANK ON A HILL"". I went to the Gas Station, yes, were you heroically tried to kill the hostile tank. I went to the Antennae, recklessly destroying soflams, just to find nothing
This continued until I've been to every point. And we were about to win, as if you were there, on the gunners seat. With me, watching as the Antenna falls, as a sign of the victory, we achieved, Together.  

So if you are still reading, near our special Tree, on Forest, capping the point.

LTiberious.

----

**Q**: I saw someone with over 100% accuracy. How is that possible?

**A**: When you hit two or more enemies with a single projectile or explosive

----

**Q**: I was flying and got shot down by a Javelin. How?

**A**: The Javelin uses a lock-on system to fire, Laser Painter (attack &amp; scout helicopter) or CITV (Tank) who is ""locking on"" to a airborne vehicle, the Javelin can now lock on to this target. See this in action [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJJzoF3GSYI).

Javelin is not the only weapon that gets extended usability with assistance of SOFLAM//CITV/Laser Painter: Tank Guided shell does too (more?).

----

**Q**: Why do I sometimes have 30 bullets in my magazines? Normally I have 31?

**A**: When you have 31 bullets you have 30 in the magazine and 1 more in the chamber. This is a mechanic that has not been used in other Battlefield games. 

**Example**: You have a M16A3 and fire a short burst. You have 23 bullets left before your magazine is empty. If you reload

Reloading with a bullet in the chamber gives you shorter reload times. Reloading with 0 bullets left gives a standard reload time.


----

**Q**: What is the best weapon?

**A**: In Battlefield 3, is a best weapon for any situation. Every weapon has its use, depending on what map and environment you're fighting in.Battlefield 3 has very well balanced weapons, this allows you to use weapons that you like, without being at a disadvantage. You do, however, need to use your weapons ""correctly"". Where a weapon excels depends on a variety of factors such as rate of fire

* High rate of fire (AEK, high recoil or bullet spread.

* Low rate of fire (G3A3) = longer ranges

* Medium rate of fire (M16A3, low recoil and good accuracy.


I have most experience with Assault guns


**M16A3**: This US starter weapon is arguably the most widely used weapon for the assault class



**AK-74m**: in the latest patch this weapon had it's recoil reduced



**G3A3**: A slow firing


**AEK-971**: very high rate of fire


Finding the best weapon, or how well you can adjust and utilize a weapons' strenghts. Also, remember that the maps are different. A weapon that's very good on Operation Metro, might do less good on a map like Caspian Border. Adjusting weapons and attachments according to the map can be very rewarding. 


More weapon information:

* http://symthic.com/?s=bf3


----

**Q**: What attachments should I be using?

**A**: Attachments give your weapons more personality. You can make them even better for specific situations at a small cost. Let's see what the attachments do:

From [patch notes](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/news/view/2832654780279541805/)

* Heavy Barrel: Aimed accuracy bonus, increased maximum range.

* Foregrip: reduced horizontal sway

* Suppressor (Silencer): hides you from mini-map when you are firing, slightly lower recoil, hip fire penalty, increased aimed accuracy.

* Flash Suppressor: reduced vertical recoil

* Laser Sight: Makes weapons more accurate when hip firing. 

* Bipod: increased accuracy

Combining Foregrip with a Silencer or Heavy Barrel will offset the aimed accuracy on long range. 

Illustration for all weapons: http://i.imgur.com/7OHnO.jpg

**Generally speaking**:


* Close quarters: Foregrip


* Medium ranges: Foregrip
Barrel only.


* Long ranges: Foregrip

If you want Foregrip or not is very much so up to your own preference. Try it and find out what feels right to you.

----

**Q**: I got run over by a car and got the kill message ""Bad Luck"". Sup with that?

**A**: An empty vehicle in speed will kill anyone it runs over


----

**Q**: Why do I sometimes spawn in a parachute after spawning on a Spawn Beacon?

**A**: If the spawn beacon is placed outdoors you will spawn in a parachute. If the spawn beacon is indoors, Grand Bazaar, Tehran Highway, Strike at Karkand and possibly Sharqi Peninsula (unconfirmed)). No matter which way you're facing when planting the spawn beacon - you will always face North when you spawn on it.

Also


----

**Q**: I have 200h total play time

**A**: These two medals do not count time spent in vehicles. They are ""infantry only time"".

----

**Q**: How does the Skill stat work?

**A**:  
&gt; * You gain/lose skill level based on every confrontation with another player.

&gt;* Killing a highly skilled enemy gives you more points than killing someone less skilled.

&gt;* Points are not transferred from a player to another, one part may go up 50 points while the other loses only 20).

&gt;* The skill level is used for matchmaking.

**Q**: What is good score per minute (spm)?

**A**: Note: these numbers are approximate

* 150 spm = top 89%


* 247 spm = top 60%


* 283 spm = top 48%. 


* 391 spm = top 22%. 


* 427 spm = top 16%

**Q**: Can Recons kill someone with 1 bullet

**A**: Yes, SV98 and M40A5 causing 80 damage.

----

**Q**: What is a Service Star?

**A**: There are three different types of service stars:

1. Weapon service stars: awarded every 100 kills with a weapon. Award: 2000 points.

2. Rank service stars: the highest Military rank in BF3 is 45, making 145 the highest rank possible. In your typical game scoreboard, the number on the golden eagle of high ranked players represents their number of Colonel Service Stars.
 
3. Class/Kit serivce stars: points required per kit service star depends on the kit

* Assault: 220

* Engineer: 145

* Support: 170

* Recon: 195
