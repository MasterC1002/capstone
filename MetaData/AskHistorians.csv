1. Keep it in /r/politics.  No seriously

The mods of r/AskHistorians have attempted to contain this repetition by pointing questioners to our FAQ, but have unanimously settled on the following rule changes as the only viable solution to the problem:


1)  **No more questions about Hitler**  We are constantly saturated by questions about what did Hitler think of cap and trade, and honestly blocks the access to better questions.  Therefore, in order to improve the quality of the sub, we will spin all Hitler questions off into /r/askaboutHitler.  A sub completely dedicated to the history of Adolf Hitler.

2)  **Starting next week (4/8), we may phase out other topics that have been frequently and completely covered, such as Rome and Vikings. In the meantime, make sure to visit the new queue and upvote intriguing and novel questions there! Just not ones about Nazis.  Please visit the future /r/askaboutWWII for your questions.



3)  **Poll type questions will return with a twist**.  We removed poll type questions like ""Which General had the nicest uniform, we decided to re-allow them with a twist.  If you want to ask a poll question, as the OP you must now keep editing your post to keep a tally of all the answers and reasons within your top post.  This allows people to keep from repeating answers.

4)  **Jesus is real.  End of story**.  After constant incessant and heated argument, but it is outside of the purview of this sub.  We will delete any further questions or assertions that Jesus did not historically exist.

5)  **All first hand sources from Greece or Rome must be posted in the original language.**  Due to the heavily contentious nature at times of various translations and word usage

6)  **Going forward all conspiracy nuts, and sexists will be pre-emptively banned**.  Going forward, AnOldHope, Eternalkerri, and Algernon_Asimov, will begin going through sexist, racist

7)  **Artrw will be stepping down as mod at the end of May**  Art will be backpacking through Europe this summer, all the other moderators support this, and will usher in some major changes in the sub going forward.

8)  **We will be allowing pictures from /r/historicalrage and [Historic LOLs](http://roflrazzi.cheezburger.com/history).**  People have often complained that we are to serious here

9)  **Due to complaints from multiple users, Chinese the Chinese calender, Jewish dates in the Jewish calender, etc.  We do not wish to offend any users culture, and are doing this to accommodate them and bridge a cultural divide. 

10)  **Sports questions are exempt from the 20 year rule**  Due to the growing disinterest in academic study of sports


We understand the gravity of these changes, and discuss it amongst themselves.  However, they will not be subject to being dis-allowed; the moderation team has discussed this heartily in back channels and agree that these changes are for the best for the sub.

And sticky posts are a thing now!  Yes!

***--Preamble--***

/r/AskHistorians has grown from humble beginnings to become the leading community on Reddit when it comes to historical discussion.  It could never have happened without the almost 175

Nevertheless, and it's important that those expectations are obviously and properly articulated.

If you've been reading regularly over the last two years (yes, accuracy and overall usefulness.  With /r/AskHistorians growing all the time, and new readers constantly joining us, it would be worthwhile to return to the question of what makes a good answer.

The moderators in /r/AskHistorians are frequently asked about this.  Usually this happens while we're in the unhappy process of removing someone's comment

Before we get to that, but rather because so many of those who end up posting in here seem to forget it.  It is this:

**We do not have to post here.**

Let's pause for a moment to consider that.

We do not have to post here.

You and I both have no obligation to post a single word in /r/AskHistorians, and you're choosing to read this right now.  Everyone who asks or answers a question does so only because they want to, not because they have to.  Every flaired user had to voluntarily put in the work necessary to earn that flair, and then voluntarily maintain a standard of posting sufficient to retain it.  Each and every one of our moderators is here purely by choice.

There are two important consequences to this:

1. We are not obliged to post.
2. We are not entitled to post.

It would be perfectly fine (if not at all desirable) for every question asked in /r/AskHistorians to go completely unanswered.  Many questions do

Pursuant to the second point, or our comment is removed for violating one of the subreddit's rules, in no sense have any of our rights been infringed upon.  This is not meant as any kind of rebuke, to be clear -- just something, again, to keep in mind.

So

With that in mind

---

***--Self-Examination--***

If you're choosing to answer a question in /r/AskHistorians

1. **Do I

2. **Am I essentially certain that what I know about it is true?**

3. **Am I prepared to go into** ***real detail*** **about this?**

If the answer to any of these questions is ""no""

Let's break down what is meant by the above three questions.

- **1. Do I

In /r/AskHistorians, if you have one, but do not attempt to answer a question unless you, personally, have done a great deal of research on the subject at hand.

If you have to suddenly research something you've never heard of before...  If you have to preface your comment with ""I don't really know""

**Do not post.**

- **2. Am I essentially certain that what I know about it is true?**

While ""truth"" is a notoriously tricky concept, but anything you choose to post here should be something that you believe in enough to defend, and that you would be prepared *to* defend if challenged.  It should go without saying that you should have good reasons -- and good sources to back it up -- for believing in the truth of what you say.

Pursuant to the above, you are absolutely welcome to do so -- just be prepared to make it clear *why* you feel justified in saying it, and *why* you feel the more widely held view of the matter should be challenged.  In short, revisionism is [not necessarily a dirty word](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ito8g/open_roundtable_what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk/) -- just be absolutely open about it from the very start.

Otherwise: If your prospective answer is mostly speculation...  If you think you may have heard it on TV once

**Do not post.**

- **3. Am I prepared to go into *real detail* about this?**

This is important.

As many contributors have found out to their dismay, and our readers come here to receive in-depth and substantive answers from people who have put a great deal of time and effort into their study.

By ""real detail""

A user asks this question: ""What is the historical consensus on whether or not King David was real?""

If you were asking it

- 1a. ""The Bible is stupid and should not be trusted."" (whole answer)

- 1b. ""I'm not a historian

- 1c. [Link to ""Let Me Google That For You"" with ""King David"" as the search term] (whole answer)

- 2a. [A paragraph saying that he didn't exist

- 3a. [A short multi-paragaph essay explaining what the Old Testament says about David, and some ways in which that might be complicated]

Lest you think that answers 1a through 1c are strawmen

Answer 2 is perhaps useful

Anyway, on any number of different topics, and getting such a useful, comprehensive answer from one of them is the hoped-for consequence of asking a question here in the first place.  

**So why do so many users think that 1a through 1c are worth posting?**  They obviously do, please think twice before answering a question at all.

Detail isn't always a matter of length, from time to time, but obviously they're not of equal merit.

So: if you only feel like providing a sentence or two... If you know so little about the subject that your facts are fewer than your speculations... If you don't understand the terms of the question and want to talk about something else instead... If you have to preface your comment with an apology about its probable lack of utility...

**Do not post.**

All of this having been said... what does an actually good answer look like?

Let's take a look...

---

***--What you SHOULD do--***

In /r/AskHistorians, whose education was in another field, and who routinely post high-quality answers all the same.  In /r/AskHistorians, it's not about where you come from -- it's about what you can *do*.

So... what *should* you do?

There are five things to keep in mind once you've decided you're able to post an answer in /r/AskHistorians:

**A)** A good answer answers the OP's question in the terms it sets out.  This obviously becomes difficult if the question itself is afflicted by problems

**B)** A good answer is based upon and expressive of a deep reserve of knowledge of the subject at hand.  Your choice to answer a question in /r/AskHistorians reflects your serious degree of confidence in the truth of what you say and your ability to say a lot about it.

**C)** A good answer anticipates likely follow-up questions rather than ignoring them.  If, places, things or events that are likely to be news to the OP, don't just wait for them to ask you about it -- provide proper context and explanation up front.  So, for example, if you're answering a question about who the most prominent British propagandists of the First World War were, don't just say ""Lord Northcliffe"" and leave it at that.  The inquiring poster is likely not going to be casually familiar with Northcliffe, or with the War Propaganda Bureau

**D)** A good answer *accepts that the person asking does not know a lot about it* and attempts to remedy this in a polite and friendly manner.  While there are absolutely [certain types of questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_questions) that we officially discourage in /r/AskHistorians

**E)** Finally: better no answer than a poor answer.  The mandate of /r/AskHistorians can be expressed in two simple terms:

- To promote a better understanding of history on Reddit.
- To do so by connecting inquiring readers with people capable of providing in-depth and accurate answers to their questions

This is what we do here.  This is the job before us.

In light of this, sketchy, uncertain answers **are not contributions -- they are obstacles**.  Do not post answers you aren't sure about in the hope that someone will come along and correct you.  Do not post hopelessly incomplete answers based on a skimming of a Wikipedia article just because nobody has yet replied after a few hours.  *Do not guess.*  **Do not invent**.

---

***--Conclusion--***

I'll wrap this up with a **TL;DR:** 

Answering a question in /r/AskHistorians is a choice, and will not resent or reject requests for further information; you will respect the person asking the question and attempt to help them however you can.  You will say everything you need to in order to provide an immediately useful answer to the question at hand, and you will be prepared to say more if necessary.

A little housekeeping before we start:

 - **/r/AskHistorians is relaxing its ban on post-1993 content for this AMA.** A lot of important and pivotal events have happened in North Korea since 1993, nuclear brinkmanship, some rapprochement between North and South Korea, and the Six-Party Talks. This is all necessary context for what's happening today.

 - **I may be saying *I'm not sure* a lot here.** North Korea is an extremely secretive country

I'm also far from being the world's best source on North Korea. Unfortunately

 - **It's difficult to predict anything with certainty about the country.** Analysts have been predicting the collapse of the Kim regime since the end of the Cold War.

Generally speaking, prediction is an art best left to people charging $5.00/minute over psychic hotlines.

1365102762.0,1boh63,[META] Seeking reader opinions on possible rules change re: NSFW questions,NMW,1608,440,293,"***Please upvote this post for visibility***

While this has not often come up in /r/AskHistorians

The situation is this:

While it is very rarely a concern, an NSFW tag may stop you from looking at such a thread at work in full, but it may not stop the *title* of that thread being brought to your IT department's attention even if you're just looking at /r/AskHistorians' front page.

**Edit:** Since there seems to be a primary focus in the commentary below about the implications of this for those at work

There appear to be two potential options before us:

1. A ban on obviously NSFW language in post titles; users asking questions are encouraged to make their titles as SFW as possible, but that's only one possible way to approach it.  It could also simply involve rephrasing everything in the question title into a more clinical, reserved sort of tone.

2. No change; users may continue to include NSFW language in their question titles

We're hoping to get some feedback on these possibilities before moving forward with anything.  Alternative viewpoints are gladly welcomed.

And just to be **absolutely clear:** we have **no** intention of banning questions about NSFW subjects.  You can ask about anything you wish.  What should be under discussion here is how such questions are presented,True,,t5_2ssp3,1365112377.0,meta,military,t3_1boh63

[Here's the comment I talked about.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jxpt3/til_when_alexander_the_great_was_a_child_his/cbjdn12)

I concluded that you'd have to know something about ancient history and the context of the story: what was Alexander's life like, did the contemporary people often make up something like this for the sake of propaganda or a cult of personality, was there lots of outlandish stories like this that actually have been verified by multiple sources etc. 

I don't even know if these factors are important or if there's more things you'd have to take into account. Until you know something about the context

I don't know any of that so that's why I am asking you. How likely is it that this event actually happened in some form? Whether or not this took place: why was this written and who was meant to read it?

My understanding/summary from y'all's help; comments/discussion on this would be great

Carter isn't **technically** correct because at least one shot was fired by Americans during Operation Eagle Claw. However, so he's right there were no major boots-on-the-ground operations or aerial campaigns by the US military under his administration

HOWEVER - he funded actions that were arguably proxy wars, and later Somali fighters when the Soviets began supporting the Ethiopians. Support for the Nicaraguan contras began under Carter as well.

All this was largely logistic support

That post caught my eye when I first saw it

From [Lynn Sacco](http://works.bepress.com/lynn_sacco/):

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Th-W/Venereal-Disease.html

&gt;Doctors were vexed as to how so many girls had become infected, working-class, immigrant, or African-American families. When the evidence increasingly pointed to men from their own class, doctors, public health officials, social reformers, towels, health care professionals ignored the possibility of sexual assault and insisted instead that girls faced the greatest risk of exposure in the school lavatory.

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/In-Ke/Incest.html

&gt;Historians have shown how twentieth-century rhetoric may have hidden more abuse than it exposed. The strangerperpetrator, most experts resisted the idea that incest might be common.

A beautiful woman, her true form appears, either hollowed out lik an old tree or ugly. In some parts of sweden its only a foxtail that peeks out from her dress that can warn her victims.
Can also give gifts from the forest
Steals the souls of the men she beds.

Also, luck with fishing and most importantly for the fisherman - the promise that the sea will never take him, no matter how horrible the weather.

To understand the implications of this story



**""Näcken"" The Neck** 
A young attractive naked male, often a fiddle.
Is said to lure people into the stream

It is said that the melody of his fiddle is magical in itself, was unable to to stop, and they would play and dance until they died, or where lured down into the waters.

The tales also said that for the price of your soul and/or blood, or according to some stories at crossroads. It was espescially likely to meet him during the midsummer festivities.

I'm making this post as a part of the reason why I contribute to r/AskHistorians : I have been disappointed at the level of discourse

To that end, and usually the full run of that journal, extending back sometimes a century.  Access to JSTOR is so expensive that, in general, only research institutions can afford it; faculty and students at 4-year colleges or community colleges might have limited access, or none at all.  And it's prohibitively expensive for most individuals.

But now JSTOR is offering read-only access to most of these materials to everyone -- three articles every two weeks to those who register

It is limited access, required physically travelling to some research library with a subscription.  It might have even required student or faculty status.  In general, these academic articles are written for other historians, not for the general public.  But in a great age of the democratization of information, this expensive resource is now available to all.

I'd like to encourage all the interested historians on this sub who don't already have access to JSTOR to take a look.  It's a hell of a resource; basically the scholarly output of generations of historians

A little background on Chechnya

Chechnya is nominally a part of the Russian Federation in the North Caucasus. Chechnya first came under Russian control in the late 19th century

The Chechens fought a long war of independence in the 19th century, somewhat like denominations. Sometime in the 20th century, most Chechens followed the Naqshbandiyya path (tariqa), while today they are predominantly Qadiriyya.

The North Caucasus are extremely diverse, with a vast majority of ethnic Chechens.
The issue of language in Chechnya is, a Caucasian language in the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. It is unique to the Caucasus, and is spoken by the great majority of ethnic Chechens living in Chechnya. Throughout Chechnya’s history Cyrillic, Latin, and even Arabic alphabets have been used, depending on the influence of Russification policies, Islam, most Chechens throughout the twentieth century also spoke Russian. In the early 1990s all non-Cyrillic alphabets were made illegal for use in the Russian federation

I am not a linguist

I received my degree in Russian History, as I am willing to field questions on Chechnya and its history, and also on theoretical terrorism, suicide bombing, and guerrilla warfare as it pertains to Chechnya. I have published two peer reviewed articles on Chechnya, one on the Russian counterinsurgency operation in Chechnya from 1994-1996, and the second on the Chechen insurgency and the development of terrorism.

I will not answer nor address any questions or comments with racist or hateful undertones. This sub is for enlightened and educational historical dialogue, but also an ideology and mindset of 'terror,' and so I recognize that terrorism comprises much more than a single act. There is no universally agreed upon definition of terrorism, so the definition that I use, a combination of two common definitions, one provided by Boaz Ganor and by Rhonda Callaway &amp; Julie Harrelson-Stephens:

&gt; ""Terrorism is defined as any intentional act of violence against civilian targets that do not have the authority or ability to alter government policy

Recently there has been a growth in posts asking extremely general questions. These questions often sound extremely similar, and often extremely bad answers. This then often requires moderator intervention due to the large number of responses ignoring our guidelines and rules. The subreddit is intended to be a source of in-depth historical knowledge, and these questions are not taking advantage of that.  

The mod team has therefore agreed that we want to take direct action

For those seeking clarification about what ‘more appropriate places’ means

These are the guidelines that we will be using when removing these kinds of questions:

**One of our key principles regarding questions is that they should be as precise as possible; we do not want threads that will attract only bad answers

**Our guiding rubric is; if a thread can be summarised as ‘tell me random stuff about X through history’ then it falls into this category of trivia rather than looking for in-depth answers which are this community’s main focus. Questions likely to be removed are those asking about all periods and all places at once. If your question begins with the phrase ‘In your area of expertise’ strongly reconsider posting it, or focusing your topic to enable more informative answers.**

***

***Rules Post Part the Second***

Following our recent meta thread on the issue (found here) we have also decided to implement some measures regarding NSFW threads. For anyone unfamiliar with the term

We would like anyone asking a NSFW question to put the ‘nsfw’ tag on their question after posting it

This is only ever likely to be relevant to a small number of threads, we aren’t concerned about NSFW content at all. These rules are about allowing people to a) know that a thread has NSFW content before looking at the comments and b) making sure no-one gets in trouble for accidentally viewing a NSFW title.",Meta,False,,t5_2ssp3,1366214743.0,middleeast,

&gt;Dear Mr. Andropov

&gt;My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going to vote to have a war or not? If you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war. This question you do not have to answer

&gt;Sincerely
Samantha Smith

As you may read from the linked article, he did respond with this:

&gt;Dear Samantha

&gt;I received your letter

&gt;It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl

&gt;You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.

&gt;Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.

&gt;Yes, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.

&gt;Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, attacked our country, burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.

&gt;In that war, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.

&gt;In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—will it use nuclear weapons first against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on Earth.

&gt;It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country– neither workers, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.

&gt;We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, Samantha.

&gt;I invite you, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – Artek – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.

&gt;Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

&gt;Y. Andropov

Noting the escalated tensions during that period it was a blessing for the Soviet leader

There's also something else

&gt;After hearing the [news conference] broadcast [announcing relaxed border control between East and West Germany], they were ordered to find the ""more aggressive"" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through ""as Schabowski said we can.""

&gt;It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, the guards yielded, opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.

Do not put author name first. Do not give just a list of books. Do not put your descriptions in the first person (no ""I really like this book because..."", and I am, after all, putting it in the Early Modern France section).

_________________________
General/Historiography
------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Human Past* by Chris Scarre (ed.): A very readable, and used as an introductory book in many universities. Still updated.

2. *How Humans Evolved* by Boyd and Silk: Everything is also discussed by The Human Past

-----------------------------------------------------
Modern
-------------------------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Birth of the Modern World: Global Connections and Comparisons 1780-1914* by C.A. Bayly. The book, eventually dominant one, interacted with them. It also raises the issue of this age as the first true globalization.

2. *Replenishing the Earth: The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Angloworld 1783-1939* by John Belich. Why is it that British colonialism made the largest impact, Belich draws attention both to the economic cycles that made the British Empire the paramount power, and the revolution in settlerism as an ideology that allowed for a wide-ranging cultural expansion.

3. *The Red Flag: A History of Communism* by David Priestland. One of the dominant modern ideologies, creates a theoretical framework for understanding its different manifestations (dividing it into three large currents - romantic, radical and modernist) and pays close attention to Chinese, Cuban and other communisms, rather than concentrating on Moscow alone.

4. *The Global Cold War: Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times* by Odd Arne Westad. Tracing the origins of modern Third World interactions with the developed world to the geopolitics of the Cold War

5. *The age of...* series by Eric Hobsbawm. This series of books (the Age of Revolution


*WWI*

1. See [NMW's incredible list here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78pg65)

2. *The First World War*, and he was generally believed to be at the height of his game in this particular work. It situates the war in the ""senseless tragedy"" school of cultural memory, but this is hardly a fringe position. Still, very good.

3. *The First World War*, if you want more, look to his much larger The First World War - Vol. I: To Arms (2003) -- the first of a projected three volumes and absolutely staggering in its depth. This first volume alone runs to 1250 pages.

4. *The First World War: A Complete History*, but it's a decision for which good arguments can be made.

*WWII*

1. *The Struggle for Europe* by Chester Wilmot. A detailed account of the European theater during World War II, and major battles / strategies of the rest of the war.


**Europe/ ""The West""**

1. *Postwar* by Tony Judt - a fantastic in-depth history of Europe after the second world war more-or-less up to the present day by one of the greatest historians of Modern Europe. There are some fantastic insights (like a chapter on the formation of welfare states) as well as a general overview of the period to be found here.

2. *Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century* by Mark Mazower. Less a comprehensive history of the continent than a piece to explain how ""civilized"" Europe became the bloodiest continent in that century

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism as Civilization* by Stephen Kotkin. The book takes the building of Magnitogorsk

*Western Europe*

1. *Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age* by Ruth Harris. Taking the Lourdes site and the original visions supposedly seen there in 1855, and the question of faith and belief. It is a beautifully written book, and goes far beyond what the title suggests.

2. *A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics

3. *A History of Western Society* by McKay, picks up where The Human Past left off (with an overlap in antiquity) and provides the historical, rather than archaeological, perspective. Very readable, and though it's a textbook and thus most suitable for students (with plenty of 'summaries' and lists of important key words), I'd still recommend it to people who are interested in history without having access to the formal education (and to archaeologists who only study prehistory!).

4. *The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy* by David Cannadine. A massive (800 pages) look at everything to do with the downfall of the British aristocracy at the end of the 19th century. I'm not done it yet

5. *The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism* by Arthur Hertzberg. This work focuses on the development of modern, examining how ostensibly humanist Enlightenment thinkers could justify the continued exclusion of a group. Fascinating reading, not only for its investigation of Jewish history, but also for examining an aspect of the Enlightenment that doesn't often get to the general public.

6. *The Conquest of Nature: Water, with really interesting sections on Frederick the Great, the reshaping of the Rhine, and how Nazi racial and environmental policy intersected.

*Australia*

1. *The Federal Story*, with no hindsight or after-the-fact analysis.

2. *Alfred Deakin*

3. *Federation Fathers*

4. *The First Decade of the Australian Commonwealth*, but it’s sweet.

5. *Australians*, ???). This trilogy (which is still being written) is essential reading for anyone interested in Australian history. Keneally, the author responsible for ‘The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith’ (made into a classic Aussie movie) and ‘Schindler’s Ark’ (filmed as ‘Schindler’s List’), shares the stories of the “little people” in Australia’s past. These are real stories of real people, set in their proper context of Australia’s larger history, and described with a novelist’s style.

*Holocaust*

1. *War &amp; Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust* by Doris L. Bergen. A brief, tracing from the prewar Nazi ascent to power through the end of World War II. Written by one of the best academics currently working on the subject. Includes a good amount of analysis of postwar Holocaust scholarship, too.

2. *The Destruction of the European Jews* by Raul Hilberg. Basically the original work on the Holocaust by the father of Holocaust studies. Originally published in 1961, and while some of it is naturally out of date, it still holds up well today.

3. *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution* in Poland by Christopher R. Browning. This focused case study investigates the nature of German killers in the Holocaust, were ""ordinary"" guys without any particular ideological commitment to Nazism or antisemitism.


**Africa**

1. The Fate of Africa* by Martin Meredith

2. *We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families* by Philip Gourevitch

3. *Across the Red River* by Christian Jennings
In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo by Micheala Wrong

**East Asia**

1. *Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War* by Stewart Lone: Fairly straightforward. Not just China but basically every major Asian conflict. It is a behemoth of information that has been collected from far and wide for the reader's convenience. It covers history, art, social chances and upheavals, family and even romantic impact from living during all these wars. An excellent reference.

2. *English in Singapore* by Lisa Lim et al: Discussion of the evolution of the English language in Singapore after independence, social movements and chances, and even how it affects foreign policy and international standing in economics and business. It also gives a solid history on the developments of Singapore's economy and political system. Awesome read.


*China*

1. *China's Rise in Historical Perspective* edited by Brantly Womack: [fishstickuffs note: If I had to suggest just one book to read from this list this would be it] If anyone is seriously interested in what trends have shaped the current Chinese political landscape, which include religious cosmology, identity crises in wake of the revolution, ecological issues, and international relations.

2. *Chen Village* by Chan, and the work reflects some of the best of both disciplines. Rarely have I felt as connected to historical characters as I have in learning of the exploits of low-level, unimportant peasant officials in Chen Village. This book communicates the trends in political and social change in China in the last 60 years in a way that is hard to replicate from pure analysis.

3. *Taiwan-China: A Most Ticklish Standoff*- edited by Adam W. Clarke. Besides having the most fantastic name of any academic work on the subject I've seen

4. *Managing Sino-American Crises: Case Studies and Analysis* edited by Michael Swaine and Zhang Tuosheng. Pretty much THE book on the issue. By far the most extensive analysis of crisis behavior by China and America during Sino-American crises that I know of. Begins with the pos-WWII period

5. *US Taiwan Strait Policy: The Origins of Strategic Ambiguity* by Dean P. Chen This book actually came out this year, certainly not for casual reading. This is an academic analysis of the policy making process, and is making an argument for how to conduct US policy into the future. But in the course of its analysis it provides a fantastic history of the relationship between the US and the Taiwan issue.

6. *Charm Offensive* by Joshua Kurlantzick: An excellent history and analysis of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) international politics, and a must read for any student of the PRC's foreign policy history.

*Korea*

1. *The Koreans: Who They Are, then moving through the Korean War, the rebuilding, the Korean economic development and social &amp; political upheaval, the Seoul Olympics which was instrumental to South Korea's rise to the global stage, and North &amp; South relations through out. A must read.

2. *Nothing to Envy* by Barbara Demick: A heart wrenching piece on the effects of the North Korean regime on the lives of regular North Korean people. It's half based on oral accounts that were taken down by Demick as she interviewed many defectors from the North. The other half is grounded in well researched statistics, more focused on telling a narrative of famine, oppression, and strange social constructs than standing as a historical reference but one of the essentials on getting a ground eye view of what life was like in the North.

3. *The North Korean Economy* by Nicholas Eberstadt: Focusing on the economic history of North Korea, is essential to understanding how the North started so strong but is today, practically a failed state. Eberstadt worked tirelessly to check and recheck, then check again all of his numbers because North Korea is notorious for inflating or deflating numbers as they see fit so much that often the records that they present to the outside world cannot be trusted, nor can they be verified. The economics of the North affected every other aspect of life in the North, as well as shaping its political, domestic, often presented in text and reinforced visually with many graphs

*Japan*

1. *The Making of Modern Japan* by Marius Jansen: This is the definitive work of modern era Japan. Jansen's work is a chronicle of not just the rise of railroads, electricity and gas, the telegraph, milk!, and other interesting developments of early modern Japan. He gives background, history, cultural and political analysis, but can now be looked at retrospectively at our leisure

2. *Inventing Japan* by Ian Buruma: I've joked to friends before by calling this ""The Making of Modern Japan Lite"" but this is essentially an extremely succinct look at the changes and developments Japan went through, a way to get your foot in the door of the maze that is early modern Japanese history.

3. *Early Japanese Railways 1853-1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan* by Dan Free: Surprisingly enough

--------------------------------------------------
Premondern
------------------------------------------------

**Western Eurasia**

*Prehistory*

1. *The Horse, culture at the beginning of the Bronze Age. The most current version and most factual (and least political) of the Indo-European debate, for critical readers it's still very valuable because of the large amount of archaeological data that is presented while the polemic writing style makes it accessible to non-specialists as well.

*Mesopotamia*

1. *A History of the Ancient Near East: ca 3000-323 BC*

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The Celts* by Nora Chadwick: Introduction to Celtic studies. It's an older book (first published in 1970), art, and society. It also does a fantastic job of explaining how ""Celtic"" isn't a homogenous entity, but rather many different cultures over a large area over a large period of time.

*Carthage*

1. *Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization* by Richard Miles. One of the few general histories of Carthage with a decent detour into syncretism of the Herculean and other cults. Can't fully vouch for the accuracy as this isn't my specialization but it appears well researched with a decent amount of cross reference to the archaeological evidence.

*Classical Greece*

1. *A History of the Greek City-States

2. *A Social and Economic History of the Greek World*, and a good introduction into how ancient Greece's economics have been interpreted. It is a little dry, so do not take this as a casual read.

3. *Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times* by Thomas R. Martin. This provides a survey of Greek history focusing mostly on political and military events. Good for those looking for an introduction but also provides fairly in depth analysis of key subjects.


*Rome*

1. *The World of Pompeii* edited by John. J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss

2. *Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History* by Christopher S. Mackay. This is another survey from the ancient world


*Medieval Europe*

1. The Viking World* by Stefan Brink: A 2008 book which combines many short chapters on any topic relevant to Vikings or the Scandinavian late Iron Age. Strong point is that many chapters are written by the relevant specialists instead of a single author who is trying to specialise in everything. Bad point is that this means that there's not much of a central theme connecting the chapters

2. *The Discovery of the Individual 1050-1200* by Colin Morris. This is an older work but represents a shift in thought regarding the individual on a personal level. Framed within the context of Western Christianity

3. *Britain After Rome* by Robin Fleming. A comprehensive guide to Anglo-Saxon England. Its kinda hard to jump into (it assumes you already know the politics, but does a fantastic job of creating a narrative tale of the Anglo-Saxon people. More of an archeological look than a historical look.

*Early Modern Europe*

1. *Tudor England* by John Guy

2. *The 16th Century* edited by Patrick Collinson. (Good god, and the fringe areas of the British Isles - great for both dipping in for short chapter-length essays but also for detailed study.

3. *Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490-1700* By Diarmaid MacCulloch - pretty much the definitive book on the European Reformation

4. *The Elizabethan Puritan Movement* By Patrick Collinson - a bit more specific but the best account of perhaps the most interesting period of religious change in English History by one of its greatest historians

5. *Montaillou* by E. Le Roy Ladurie. One of the first and best microhistorical books

* France

1. [Night Hawk's fantastic list on France](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78t1q0)

2. *A History of Modern France*, and it's written like one. Very dense and not much verve, but extremely useful in providing context for a lot of these other books and clearing up their ambiguities.

3. *The Village of Cannibals*, but it's an interesting tale of shifting ideas of social class and political thought in a particular setting. Bonus feature: gory murders of French noblemen! (well, one French nobleman, but you can't have everything)

4. *Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1880-1914*, especially the southern half. Weber does a great job explaining how France was rural and how the Third Republic worked to bring rural France into the fold: peasants into Frenchmen.

5. *Marianne in Chains*, and has some really interesting points to make on historical memory after the war, as well. Not a political history - he references Pétain and Laval on some occasions, but the most political he gets is going into local governments.

6. *Suite Francaise*, so what we have is constructed from her drafts and her unfinished notes.


**South Asia**

1. *Forging the Raj

**Africa**

1. *Africa in History* by Basil Davidson

2. *The African Slave Trade* by Basil Davidson, his research and knowledge are particularly strong in that area.

3. *The Strong Brown God* by Sanche de Gramont

**East Asia**

*China*

1. *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* by Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2nd ed. 2010). Fantastic general survey of Chinese history

2. *Chinese Civilzation: A Sourcebook* edited by Patricia Buckley Ebrey. Another standard find in intro Chinese history courses in college. This is a great introduction to

3. *Soldiers of the Dragon* edited by CJ Peers. Osprey publishers have a wide variety of awesome military histories. You wouldn't be likely to find this in a college classroom

4. *This Is China: The First 5, it is a great book to illustrate the fact that trying to understand all of Chinese history at once is impossible and is as much art and dynamic dialogue as it is inexact science and lively academia. Another must have.

5. *The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age* by Li Liu and Xingcan Chen: Only recently having finished reading this myself, agriculture, tools and warfare, regional and inter-cultural influences on development, to even diet and health. Most of the research comes from archaeological studies as well as interpreting inscriptions, artifacts, and other reputable academic sources.

6. *Chinese Ceramics: From the Paleolithic Period through the Qing Dynasty* by Laurie Barnes et al: This incredible work not only talks about porcelain and other Chinese pottery, life, trade, and politics. It is an extremely good book for general Chinese history as well as an in depth look at Chinese art over the centuries, which relates heavily to Chinese cultural, philosophical and religious thought, all through the lens of pottery.

7. *Daily Life in Traditional China: The Tang Dynasty* by Charles Benn: Extremely accessible book that is based completely on secondary sources and cites other reference books. It is a very handy introductory primer to what life generally was like for the average Chinese person. While obviously focused on the Tang Dynasty

*Japan*

1. *The Samurai Sourcebook* by Stephen Turnbull (and any other book by Turnbull for that matter): An extremely detailed and thorough, the warrior class that shaped Japan. It covers everything anyone ever wanted to know about samurai, from daily life during piece, life during war, equipment, pay, rank, politics

2. *The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan* by Takekoshi Yosaburou: Exhaustive in its breadth and scope, places, and dates than one could ever hope to find in one consolidated text, this is everything you ever wanted to know about Japanese money, economics, and value and more. I recently went back to this monster of a book to fulfill a request to find out what the koku(measure of wealth) value of all the individual Japanese provinces were. Sure enough, it was only a matter of picking out the relevant statistics and information, prices

**The Americas**

*Mesoamerica*

1. *Codex Chimalpopoca* by John Bierhorst (1998): This text actually contains two sources

*North America*

1. *Archaeology of the Southwest* by Linda Cordell and Maxine McBrinn (Third Edition is from 2012): A comprehensive look by two of the most respected names in the field.

2. *The Chaco Meridian* by Stephen Lekson (1999): One of the most interesting and innovative books about the area

3. *Archaeology Without Borders: Contact

---------------------------------------------
Cultural/Intellectual/Religious Studies
------------------------------------------

**Religion**

*Christianity*

1. *Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity* by Daniel Boyarin (2004): although it has serious problems of readability if you do not know enough about the period, neither Judaism nor Christianity existed before they constructed each other. See also Judith Lieu's Neither Jew nor Greek (2004).

2. *The Parting of the Ways: between Christianity and Judaism and their significance for the character of Christianity* by James D. G. Dunn (1991; 2nd. ed. 2005): a thorough survey of the status of Judaism at the time of Jesus

3. *The Quest of the Historical Jesus: a critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede* by Albert Schweitzer (1905, to the point that the historiography of historical Jesus research in split into 'quests', the first of which begins with Reimarus and ends with Wrede (and Schweitzer). This book is essentially a historiography of the Jesus question, and introduced one of the most enduring questions in Jesus research: was Jesus eschatologically minded?

4. *The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the authentic sayings of Jesus* by the Robert Funk, assembled by Funk, to determine the 'authentic' teachings of Jesus by voting on each one with coloured beads. This book contains both their own translation (the ""Scholar's Translation"") of the four canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, coloured sayings of Jesus, and a guide to their methodology. Incredibly controversial, both within and without the field, the Jesus Seminar's work is best appreciated when compared to the work of others in the ""Third Quest.""

5. *A brief introduction to the New Testament* by Bart D. Ehrman (2004): a very good introduction to the methods and contexts of New Testament studies

My specialty is the history of wine from the dawn of civilization to modern times.  Since nothing occurs in a vacuum

To set expectations I am less familiar with the history of spirits (hard alcohol) and prohibition in general.  Feel free to ask questions regarding those topics though as I may happen to know the answer or someone else reading this may be able to offer some insight.

Edit:  12:25 PM PST - thanks for all the great questions.  I need to take a break and help with the kids.  I will come back to answer more questions at some point.  Especially the ones on wine in Islamic areas

This question and similar others emerged last night when my brother and I had a little debate about this topic and some others regarding national identity. It is my impression that there is people in the Spanish-speaking world that seem to have an issue with this and consider that US citizens have somehow co-opted this term out of some feeling of superiority. Although this feelings might or might not be part of the American present or past identity

In order to further illustrate the nature of our little midnight debate I will throw out some more questions. I am not really asking for a list of anwers matching this list of questions

- When did the term ""American"" become the denonym of citizens in the United States?
- Did the inhabitants of the English colonies called themselves Americans?
- If they did
- Did citizens in some other  North American colonies like Quebec called themselves ""Americans""?
- If they did, Canadian or Mexican ones? In other words, when did it started to refer exclusively to US citizens?
- How is this identity linked to American Revolutionary War and Independence? Did authorities such as politicans or the ""Founding Fathers"" encourage the use of the word ""American""? Did they discouraged other terms or denominations?

I understand this questions may be too broad or difficult to answer but I hope that the wonderful redditors that post in r/askhistorians could add some insight to our ignorance. Thanks!

Specifically

I feel ok in assuming that ordinary people across the world are generally well-meaning and nice, that the people these spies interacted with in their daily activities; e.g. their coworkers, friends, maybe even their children; revealed themselves to be people just like them.

This part is certainly a little ethnocentrist, let alone an entire class of them, but what motivation would these presumably very intelligent, very educated, and very adept at seeming Western people have had not to simply join the enemy, so to speak?

I understand that it need not have been hatred for the people they had gotten to know in the West; it's possible that they might have been trying only to keep the balance of power and information even so as not to allow their government to fall.

I'm hoping the answer is more interesting than the threat of death for turning their coats.  

Perhaps some of them did join those they were spying on. Do any of you know anything about that? I hope for their sake there weren't any loyal Soviet spies in the Witness Protection Program or its analogs.

Chaucer also mentions his Doctor was ""well-versed in Aesculpaius too | And what Hippocrates and Rufus knew |

**Today:**

The ""Monday Mysteries"" series will be focused on, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the historical Coriolanus

**This week, have compelling evidence.**

Not everything that happens does so for the reasons that appear on the surface.  This is simply true; a great deal of work often goes into concealing the real motives and actors behind things that occur, the consequences would be very significant indeed.  There are hands in the darkness, men (and women) behind the throne, powers within powers and shadows upon shadows.

What are some examples from throughout history of conspiracies that have actually taken place?  Who were the conspirators?  What were their motives?  Did they succeed?  What are the implications of their success or failure -- and of us actually knowing about it?

Feel free to discuss any sort of conspiracy you like, artistic, military -- even academic.  Entirely hypothetical bonus points will be awarded to those who can provide examples of historiographical conspiracies.

Moderation will be light, substantial, and posted in good faith!

1358435805.0,16r63g,[Meta] Some reminders and clarifications about answers.,eternalkerri,563,121,112,"Okay folks

We have seen a recent amount of sizable growth in the past few months with our repeated posting to /r/bestof and winning ""Best Large Sub"" from truebestof 2012.  We are flattered and excited by this growth


Lately we have seen quite a few rules debates occurring around here.  They have gotten so bad that they ended up exceeding the actual number of posts that actually addressed the issue.  Its fine that you want to debate the rules, contact the moderators and ask for a clarification, or ask to take them to a meta thread.  We are here to answer questions, not bog down a thread with debates over the definition of ""is.""

Now

1. ) **The rules are the absolute bare minimum that must be met**.

Most top tier posts fit these guidelines.  However we have seen quite a few mediocre posts (using those terms loosely).  We prefer that you exceed the rules.

2.)  **Copy pasta of an article is lazy posting and spammy**

Someone the other day simply copy and pasted the text of a wiki article as their entire post.  Firstly, its just spammy and lazy.  This leads me to...

3.)  **Simply throwing a link up is also a bit lazy** 

If you are linking to a web site or another /r/askhistorians thread that already answered this question

4.)  **Don't post just to ""save for later""  There is a save link feature to reddit.**

Please use it.  You are just spamming up the thread.

5.)  **If you can't answer now

If you do not have to the time to answer, and even though your answer may not end up at the top, you can still use it later to get your flair if that is what you are after.

6.)  **If your answer begins with ""I'm guessing"" or ""I don't know

If you are not **100, and its not a contest to answer.  I myself have stopped halfway through more posts than I have finished here because I wasn't 100% sure of my answer.  Quit guessing, you aren't being graded.

7.)  **Source PLEASE if asked

If you are being asked for a source, it doesn't need to be a citation down to the page, but something should be available if you are asked.  You probably aren't the only person to read that book, so it allows people to check your work.

8.)  **In any debate

Unlike many other subs, and the way controversial posts are handled.  Very little is done arbitrarily by ""power tripping mods"" outside of elimination of posts that blatantly violate the rules.  When a mod says the post is not good enough and deletes it and you want to object, take it to mod mail.  When a mod asks for a source, they are doing so for a reason, just give sources.  If you have any problems send it to mod mail, do not spam up a thread with your Braveheart style ""FREEEDOM TO POST!!!!"" speech.

And before you ask

9.)  **""UPVOTED FOR AWESOME!""  ""You rock!"" etc. are spam.  Stop it**

'Nuff said.  Let your upvotes speak.

10.)  **Two sentences does not an answer make.  If you are going to answer the question

If your answer is something like this exchange, show why.  Anyone can write a two sentence answer, someone who actually cares writes a paragraph.

11.)  **Actually answer the question.  Quit trying to redefine the question for them and obfuscate that you don't actually know the answer.  Just bloody answer it.**

Lately, thats nice and all, but it doesn't answer the question.  If someone asks, ""Why did Hitler have a mustache?"" don't answer with a bunch of half thought statements about the history of facial hair, answer that specific question.  

12.)  **Stop with the non-sequitors.  Only post something that is relevant.**

Similar to #11.  If OP asks about the history of Islam in the Philippines

The history of Alchemy (more Egyptian/Greek/Middle East/European than Indian or Chinese)

/u/bemonk:

Fell in love with the history of alchemy while a tour guide in Prague and has been reading up on it ever since. I do the [History of Alchemy Podcast](http://historyofalchemy.com/podcast.html) ([backup link](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/podcast/history-of-alchemy-podcast/id601738089?mt=2) in case of traffic issues). I don't make anything off of this

/u/Bemonk can speak to

* neo-platonism

* Alchemy's influence on actual science

/u/MRMagicAlchemy

First introduced to Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy as a freshman English major. His interest in the subject rapidly expanded to include both natural magic and alchemy from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the 19th-century occult revival. Having spent most of his career as an undergraduate studying ""the occult"" when he should have been reading Chaucer

His main interest is the use of analogy in the correspondence systems of Medieval and Renaissance natural magic and alchemy

/u/MRMagicAlchemy can speak to

* 19th century revival

* Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy

* Chaos Magic movement of the late 20th Century - sigilization

**We can both speak to alchemical ideas in general**

* philospher's stone/elixir of life

* Other occult systems that tie into alchemy: numerology, etc.

* ""Medical alchemy""

Winston Churchill said this about Russia: ""It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."" 

Therefore we will be taking questions about this ""enigma"" from the formation of Kievan Rus' to the fall of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the Russian Federation. We will **NOT** be answering questions about anything more recent than 1993. We will try to answer all your questions

Are panelist's will introduce themselves:

* **facepoundr**: 
I studied Russian history and more specifically Soviet Union history from high school to university. I received my Bachelor's in History from one of the best public schools in my state. I did my honor's thesis concerning Khrushchev's visit to Iowa in 1959. I've also done research into the Gulag system, and probably too much about grain. I am currently reading more Russian Literature and would like to continue my education and receive a graduate degree. Furthermore currently I am employed as non-academic staff at Cornell University. 

* **Fandorin**
I've primarily focused on Russian history between 1700 and 1917, particularly the development of the Soviet Army during WW2, from the strategic and tactical failures at the outset of the war, to the development of the Soviet Army that was able to successfully conduct theater-wide operations against the Wehrmacht. I'm a native Russian speaker.

* **TenMinuteHistory**
I am a graduate student studying Soviet history. The focus of my research is Soviet culture. I received my masters in World history (with a thesis focusing on Soviet Film)

* **occupykony**
Soviet Russia

* **MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE**
I worked for two years at a bipartisan foreign policy think tank as the research assistant to a former U.S. National Security Adviser who served during the Cold War. My Ph.D. studies have included a course on Soviet foreign policy taught by a long time member of the intelligence community who was working in the DNI during the Bush administration, both of which focus centrally on the foreign policy and international relations of Russia/USSR.

-The Mongols themselves were very diverse religiously and so therefore they were tolerant and accepting of each other so why wouldn't they be tolerant and accepting of the people in their empire.

**We will, Jewish History has tended to become synonymous with Holocaust studies. In this AMA we will focus on the thousands of years of Jewish history that do *not* involve Nazis. For the sorely disappointed: there will be a Holocaust AMA in the near future.

Anyone interested in delving further into the topic of Jewish History may want to peruse the massive list of threads on the subject compiled by /u/thefuc which [can be found in our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/jewishthreads).

Our panelists introduce themselves to you:

* **otakuman**	Biblical &amp; Ancient Near East Archaeology

    I've studied the Bible for a few years from a Catholic perspective. Lately I've taken a deep interest in Ancient Israel from an archaeological viewpoint

    My main interest is about the origins of the Old Testament : who wrote it

* **the3manhimself** 	ANE Philology | New Kingdom Egypt | Hebrew Bible 

    I studied Hebrew Bible under well-known biblical translator Everett Fox. I focus on philology, Early Iron Age and I'm basically useless after the Babylonian Exile.

* **yodatsracist** 	Comparative Religion

    I did a variety of studying when I thought, mostly focusing on the history and historicity of the Hebrew Bible.  I'm now in a sociology PhD program, and though it's not my thesis project, I am doing a small study of a specific Haredi (""Ultra-Orthodox"") group and try to keep up on that end of the literature, as well. 

* **gingerkid1234** 	Judaism and Jewish History

    I studied Jewish texts fairly intensely from literary, my knowledge starts around the Second Temple era and extends from there, and is most thorough in the area of historical religious practice, but Jewish history in other areas is critical to understanding that.  My knowledge of texts extends from Hebrew bible to the early Rabbinic period to later on.  It's pretty thorough, but my knowledge of texts from the middle ages tends to be restricted to the more prominent authors.  I also have a fairly thorough education (some self-taught, some through school) of Jewish history outside of religious text and practices, focusing on the late Middle Ages to the present.

    I'm proficient in all varieties of Hebrew (classical, and modern), and can figure out ancient Jewish Aramaic.  Because of an interest in linguistics, I have some knowledge about the historical development of Jewish languages, including the above, as well as Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Romance languages

* **CaidaVidus** 	US-Israel Relations 

    I have worked on the political and social ties that bind the U.S. and Israel (and, ca.1920-1948), particularly the armed Zionist resistance to British rule in Palestine. I also focus on the transition within the U.S. regarding political and public support of Israel, specifically the changing zeitgeist between 1967 and 1980.

* **haimoofauxerre**	Early Middle Ages | Crusades 

     I work on religion and violence in the early and central European Middle Ages (ca. 700-1300 CE). Mostly I focus on the intellectual and cultural roots of Christian animosity towards Muslims

I'd like to announce a new sister subreddit to /r/AskHistorians and the rest of the /r/Ask... family, cultural and sociolinguistic diversity (sociocultural and linguistic anthropology) and archaeology. We get a lot of questions on those subjects here; but while we have a number of fantastic flaired users who specialise in some aspect of anthropology, they unfortunately don't always get high quality answers. So the idea of /r/AskAnthropology is to have a Q&amp;A subreddit focusing on anthropology alone, giving them a better chance of getting answered.

Myself and our very own /u/Pachacamac have started the new sub, so please do come along, subscribe, ask questions, and help us get it off the ground! And if you're knowledgeable about anthropology or a related discipline, we of course need people to answer them too! 

I should point out that **this by no means implies that questions about prehistory and archaeology are no longer appropriate for /r/AskHistorians!** Rather, is the nice fuzzy overlap zone, and questions about it are welcome in either sub. We may gently steer questions that are *exclusively* about, say, evolution or ""human nature"" towards /r/AskAnthropology, in the same way we often suggest people crosspost questions about historical linguistics to /r/linguistics.

On the other hand, the major feud between Achilles and Agamemnon is that Agamemnon took Briseis away from him; she was *his* to be raped. On the other hand, the gods do punish people for raping others. Ajax rapes Cassandra on the altar of Athena and is later killed by Poseidon in punishment.

Since this subreddit’s inception nearly two years ago, and we’re often lauded as one of the most consistently academic and reliable sections of Reddit.

All of this is thanks to the work of many people

Alas, we are also aware that we have pretty big gaps in our collective expertise. For example—our India specialists are particularly scant. 

Even in those disciplines for which we *do* have good posters, to the next level—a sub for historical *discussion* among experts. I know, for example, /u/NMW has been itching to get into some deep WWI discussions.

For these reasons, our first ever **FLAIR DRIVE**! Here’s what that entails:

1. There are people on this subreddit who consistently post fantastic answers, so we can organize our subreddit better. So, *please*, if you know your historical niche quite well, *please* apply! We’ll be messaging people who we think make good candidates, but if you don’t get a letter, that doesn’t mean we don’t want you applying—it just means you’ve gotten lost among the piles of great posters we have on this sub.

2. Tell your historically-inclined friends/family about the sub! We know that there are history buffs hidden in the woodwork all over the place—please direct them to /r/askhistorians for us!

3. We (the mod team) will be going around to other subreddits, encouraging them to make the requisite 3-5 quality comments for flair.

So here’s what we ask you:

•	If you fit in the description in the above number one

•	If you know some history buffs

•	Let us know if you have any other ideas to encourage people to sign up for flair!

Thanks

This will make us one of the 125 largest subreddits on this site.  This is going to present a few new challenges for us.  Here they are with their answer.

**1)  Default status.**

Askhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO.  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was, and everyone agreed.  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set.

**2)  More posters**

We recognize that there are more people posting here.  Therefore we have a few things in place.  Firstly

Additionally, Clarification = The Laws.  Both are enforceable, and will be.

We also request that you view the [POPULAR QUESTIONS](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq) thread before you ask.

**3)Now we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys

1)  20 year rule.  If it has occurred in the past twenty years

2)  NO RACISM, OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIOR

I am so not kidding.  Do not think you are being clever, or gender history INCLUDING A MOD.  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior.  Yes, if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits, we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda, but we will also ban you.  Yes, we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry.

3)  No soapboxing or speechifying.

You hate America?  Fine, to instigate.  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too.  You will have your post removed.

4)  Copy Pasting **ANY SOURCE** as your only way of posting, history students, and history buffs.  Please assume the OP of the question isn't a complete moron and has googled for the answer.  Additionally, this is /r/askhistorians, not /r/askgoogle.  Yes, you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source,  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed.

5)  On topic, reaction gifs, or funny videos are allowed.  The humor cannot be top tiered comments.  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in *meta threads only*.  Jokes otherwise must be relevant, on topic, and hopefully funny.  I personally hate puns.

6)  Topic drift.  The original Godwins Law stated that the longer a UseNet conversation went the more likely Hitler was to be brought up.  It meant the thread was dead.  Here we also avoid topic drift.  A logical progression of topics being brought up is allowed

7) Anecdotes are frowned upon.  Unless you were there yourself at the event

8) If you are guessing

9) Wikipedia is the worst possible source you can use.  Its acceptable at times, it probably wont work here.


**4) Eternal~~kerri~~ September

In light of the ever expanding number of users, but Braveheart style speeches do not endear us to your plight (neither does calling us faggots after we ban you).  The level of our enforcement and strictness of enforcement, as well as our patience is directly inverse to the level of chicanery in the sub.  The more the rules are violated, the more people flagrantly violate them, the more people thumb their noses at the mods, the more likely we are to increase the intensity and harshness of our moderation.

So

**General**

1. *Why the West Rules

2. *A Little History of the World* by Ernst Gombrich. It is essentially a summary of human history to around the 1930s. I read this when I was younger - it's aimed perfectly at interested children

3. *Cities* by John Reader. A social history of the development of cities - particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind.

4. Winchester's *Atlantic* is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean

5. *The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second* by Fernand Braudel: Possibly the most important work of history of the 20th cen. I probably wouldn't argue this, long, slow processes as determining the shape of history. That's Braudel, in a nutshell--except he tried to deal with everything from trade, warfare, religion, urbanism, culture, when his work was translated into English).

6. *Empires of the Word* by Nicholas Oster: A great work of general world history for the general public. Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras. As a bonus

7. *The Prize* by Daniel Yergin: Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the 1800s through the 1990s. Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping, etc.

**Historiography**

1. *Who Owns Antiquity?* by James Cuno. Title is self-explanatory - discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts. The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention

2. *The Landscape of History* John Lewis Gaddis: If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you. You'll often hear references to 'thinking like a lawyer' or some other profession. Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian. He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the 'scientific' approach that social scientists shroud themselves in.

3. *What is History* E. H. Carr: Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbon's decline and fall. Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times. E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid 20th century. He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism. To quote from a review 'Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute today's mainstream thinking on British historical practice'.

4. *History: A very short introduction* John H Arnold: Its short. Its less a true 'historiography' in that it doesn't get into method or theory and is more a history of history. Again I will quote a far more able reviewer.
""This is an extremely engaging book, which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner. As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resist.""--Peter Burke, Emmanuel College, Cambridge

5. *That Noble Dream: The ""Objectivity Question"" and the American Historical Profession* by Peter Novick. Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity. A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects

**Modern History**--The study of history beginning with the 19th century globalization.

*East Asia*

1. *A Modern History of Japan* by Andrew Gordon

2. *War without Mercy* by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War. It's long and a bit academic

3. *America's Geisha Ally* by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan. It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to ""geisha ally"" in US eyes

3. *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* by Bradley K. Martin: It blends into journalism by the end (plenty of descriptions of current happenings)

4. *Embracing Defeat* by John Dower: The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan. It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy. (Immediate Post-WWII)

5. *Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods* by Sarah Thal: Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world. But it goes far deeper

*Europe/""The West""*

1. *Cod and Salt* by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson - both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America (among other things). His work is very readable.

2. *The Balkans* by Mark Mazower: A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day

3. *Yugosavia: Twice there was a Country* by John Lampe: A great overview of the turbulent 20th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state.

4. *Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945* by Tony Judt: Very detailed and good overview of Europe's post war history.

5. *George, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war. It helps if you have an understanding of late 19th century politics, but it's not necessary. Carter's writing is pretty scholarly, but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading - really readable.

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin* by Timothy Snyder. Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany during the beginnings of WWII

2. *The Dictators* by Richard Overy. This is not quite a readable as Snyder

3. *Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State* by Satter. Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union. Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why.

4. Three books by Richard Pipes: *Russia Under the Old Regime, and, well, for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of '92, like myself, his harsh criticism is not unjustified.

5. *The Russian Revolution* by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable.

6. *The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia* by Davis Hoffman. A very well-written account of the rise of the current Russian inner-circle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union. Starts with short biographies of the 6 main players in this history

*North America*

1. *1861: The Civil War Awakening* by Adam Goodheart: A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the lead-up to the Civil War.

2. *Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century.

3. *Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory* by Ben Robertson: Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs.

4. *Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion* by Peter H. Wood: Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period.

5. *The Glorious Cause* by Robert Middlekauf: Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution. Not formative or revolutionary in its approach

6. *Who Killed Canadian History?* - Jack Granatstein. If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history, which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history.

7. *The Empire Within* - Sean Mills. Important because it provides detailed information about the rise

8. *Towards Defining the Prairies: Region, and much like Quebec, how it has its own distinct history.

9. *John Adams* by David McCullough: Very readable account of an often misunderstood man. Particularly great at juxtaposing Adams's vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution.

10. *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson: Widely considered as the seminal one-volume work on the Civil War period, political, and military aspects of the time.

11. *Oxford History of the United States* series

12. *Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, the civil rights movement in the United States.

*Middle East*

1. *Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict:* a history with documents by Smith. This is a nice

2. *Turkey: A Modern History* by Zurcher. This book, and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east.

3. *A History of the Arab Peoples*: Albert Hourani

4. *The Modern Middle East: A History* James Gelvin

5. *A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire* M. Şükrü Hanioğlu

6. *Osman's Dream: A History of the Ottoman Empire* by Caroline Finkel: the best

7. *A Quiet Revolution: The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance* by Mary E. King:
The title is fairly self explanatory

8. *The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2

9. *A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind* by Michael Axworthy

10. *Rule Of Experts: Egypt

11. *Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History* by Thomas Barfield: Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries

12. *All the Shah's Men* by Stephen Kinzer: A great read about the overthrow of Iran's shah

**Western Eurasia**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agriculture.

*Near East*

1. *Persian Fire* by Tom Holland: is a really great introduction, and in my opinion not always correctly. But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about. 

2. *Rise and Fall of Egypt* by Toby Wilkinson It's very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on. It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative.

3. *The Twilight of Ancient Egypt* by Karol Mysliwiec. It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style. Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though.

4. *The Tomb in Ancient Egypt* by Salima Ikram: which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture. 

5. *Complete Pyramids* by Mark Lehner: Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes.

6. *The Bible Unearthed* by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, but bad for a broader view, as it remains contentious. It's worth picking up Grabbe's book to help spot where he does so.

7. *Did God Have a Wife *by William Dever. Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair

8. *Israel's History and the History of Israel* by Mario Liverani. Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel

9. *Ancient Israel: What do we know and how do we know it?* by Lester Grabbe. Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title, easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today. It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries.

10. *Biblical History and Israel's Past*


*Classical Civilization*

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The World of the Celts* by Simon James: Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices.

2. *The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention* by Simon James: A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic ""myth."" Its conclusions are fairly controversial


*Greece*

1. *Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria, it's a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity.

2. *From Samarkhand to Sardis*, and it is very comprehensive.


*Rome*

1. *Why Rome Fell* by Adrian Goldsworthy: Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form. He provides and excellent and detailed narrative

2. *The Fires of Vesuvius* by Mary Beard: Readable and lively

3. *Rubicon* by Tom Holland: A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life.

4. *Mediterranean Anarchy, but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn't really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they ""better"" at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.

5. *The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization* by Bryan Ward-Perkins: A work that has quickly become a standard


*Medieval*

1. *The Year 1000* by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: a fascinating narrative history of the year 1000. It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining.

2. *Exploring the World of the Vikings* by Richard Hall: Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York, due to the basically non-existing genuine historical tradition.

3. *The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land* by Thomas Asbridge: Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades, but it is also quite readable. Plus it's quite inexpensive for a scholarly work. Heavily focused on the Third Crusade, particularly on Saladin and Richard.

4. *The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire* by Edward Luttwak. Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book. He spends time detailing the military, and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors.

5. *The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History* by Norman F. Cantor: he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well

*Early Modern*

1. *Natasha's Dance* by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity

2. *The Origins of Modern Europe 1660-1789 by James L. White. Readable summary of European history during that period - I've only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful.*

3. *Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, India, Europe). But don't be fooled, this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath.

4. *The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, very accessible for the general reader.

5. *The Rise of Modern Warfare 1618-1815* by H.W. Koch: Absolutely full of etchings, France, Russia, etc., as well as general discussion of modern warfare. Each section discusses uniform, armament, and tactics. Suitable for in-depth study or just looking at the pictures.

6. For Russian history, The Romanovs.* Very readable, well-written, well-researched, very detailed and in-depth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history.

7. *History of Russia* by Vernadsky. A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus' through WWII

8. *The Return of Martin Guerre* by Natalie Zemon Davis: Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a 16th-century French village. Particularly present are questions of identity

9. *The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller* by Carlo Ginzburg: The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern (northern) Italy. The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counter-reformation Italy.

*Early Modern Colonial*

1. *Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick* - a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation

2. *Mayflower Bastard* - An interesting book, and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition, but it is worth a read.

3. *Savage Kingdom* by Benjamin Woolley - a very well written account of the Jamestown colony

4. *Big Chief Elizabeth* by Giles Milton - Giles Milton is definitely popular, but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched. This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, including the lost colony of Roanoke.

5. *The Island at the Centre of the World* by Russell Shorto - the story of the founding of New York (New Amsterdam) based on 17th century Dutch records which have only recently been discovered/translated. An extremely good book.

6. *A Voyage Long and Strange* by Anthony Horowitz - a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America

7. *The Age of Reconnaissance* by J. H. Parry: A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration. Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations. His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly good.

**East Asian History**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River Valley

*China*

1. *China: A New History* by John K. Fairbank: An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China's modern history is the main concern

2. *The Search for Modern China* by Jonathan Spence. It's a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it's more than adequate. Also

3. *A History of Chinese Civilization* by Jacques Gernet: A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history

4. *China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty* by Mark Edward Lewis: Divided between sections on history, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.

*Japan*

1. *As We Saw Them* by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west. It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable ""Orientals."" (1860)

2. *Civilization and Monsters* by Gerald Figal: an academic book, the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative, and fun to read. (Meiji period)

*Mongolia*

1. *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*: Entertaining, but all in all, awesome!

**South Asian History**

1. *Modern South Asia* by Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal: A very concise (less than 200 pages of narrative) history of South Asia from around 1600 CE onward. A very accessible and complete explanation of British colonialism in South Asia with a well-rounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movements.

**Native American Peoples**

*Pre-Columbian*

1. *1491* by Charles Mann: A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact. It discusses both North and South America. Although Mann is not a professional historian, which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans post-contact.

*Post-Columbian*

1. *The Cherokee Cases* This book isn't too difficult, this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers. This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia, which are the cornerstones of Native American Law.

2. *Custer Died For Your Sins* by Vine Deloria Jr: This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants. Written in 1969

3. *Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane* by Rodney Frey: This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History. He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur d'Alene people to contextualize everything he writes. He involves the Coeur d'Alene people without losing his focus or professionalism.

4. *Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation* by John Ehle: A very readable history of the Cherokee Nation. It follows the life of John Ridge

**Cultural/Intellectual History**

1. *A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich* by Christopher B. Krebs: Provides an interesting history of Tacitus's Germania from contextualizing its writing to how it was sought after in Renaissance Italy to how it was eventually used for propaganda purposes.

2. *Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey* by Kenneth Ch'en: An excellent history of Chinese Buddhism

3. *From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life* by Jacques Barzun: A magisterial work of cultural history, and deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Thucydides, Tacitus, Gucciardini, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.

4. *Pioneers of Photography* by Aaron Scharf. Contains personal writings of Nicephore Niepce

5. *Picture Machine: The Rise of American Newspictures* by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston. While mostly a collection of photographs

6. *Hippie* by Barry Miles: An excellent, to the music scenes, to hippies, and Vietnam protests, he covers a lot. Also, there are a lot of pretty pictures and it looks great on a coffee table.

7. *Possessing Nature: Museums, using early modern (northern) Italy as a case study. Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in proto-scientific circles.

8. *Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America* by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy by Carrie Pitzulo - both excellent books about not only Playboy magazine, and shifting gender roles in the 1960s and 1970s. You don't even have to have read Playboy to understand them!

*Exploration*

1. *The Last Expedition: Stanley's Mad Journey Through the Congo* by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson: This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration. Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England.

2. *Over the Edge of the World* by Laurence Bergreen: Bergreen is not a professional historian

3. *Longitude* by Dava Sobel: This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world. Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude. Without a way to track longitude reliably

4. *The Worst Journey in the World* by Apsley Cherry-Gerrard: This is a first hand account written by one of the scientist on the expedition to the South Pole. The book is impressive because of how disastrous and pointless their expedition turn out. Terrific examples of the conditions near the pole.

*Terrorism*

1. *The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al-Qaeda* by Gerard Chaliand and Arnaud Blin: Two French scholars trace the path of terrorism from the ancient world to the present day

2. *A History of Terrorism* by Walter Laqueur: Another broad history of terrorism. Laqueur takes an interesting stance

3. *Inside Terrorism* by Bruce Hoffman: Maybe considered the best work on terrorism. Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism (1968-present)

4. *The Looming Tower* by Lawrence Wright: Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of al-Qaeda

5. *Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground

*Christianity*

1. *The Historical Figure of Jesus* by E P Sanders. A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism. Intended for non-specialists

2. *The Historical Jesus: Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant* by John Crossan. I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes. But even when he's wrong

3. *Paul: A Very Short Introduction* by E P Sanders Sanders' work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century. The VSI series is always excellent

*History of Science*

1. *The Pasteurization of France* by Bruno Latour: I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteur's microbes as revealed truth

2.  *A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England* by Steve Shapin: Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenth-century England relied heavily on the reliable word of ""experts"" in a particular field

3. *Galileo, this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergird(ed) scientific study.

4. *Objectivity* by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution, so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas? How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds, even though clouds are constantly changing shape? Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science.",,False,,t5_2ssp3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/timi4/the_askhistorians_master_book_list/

1363471160.0,1afin4,What unifies 'the city' as a space and concept across human history?,Daeres,380,76,51,"Kingdoms

The term 'city' can deal with many variagated kinds of state and society throughout history. We have the ancient cities of Mesopotamia, Babylon and Assur. We have the *poleis* of the various Greek speaking cultures. We have various Roman built settlements and refoundations. We have the medieval merchant republic, and the medieval urban environments to which a *burgess* belonged. We have the industrial cities of the 19th and early 20th centuries. To dip out of Eurocentric perspectives a second, we have the great capitals of the various Chinese Empires, the city-states of Mesoamerica, the planned grids of Kyoto, post-Timur Samarkhand. There are probably many other variations on the concept of 'the city' that I've missed out here as well.

To clarify exactly what I'm asking;

* Are we right to refer to all of these as cities

* What is the dividing line that makes an environment urban?

* Are there features of any particular period/culture's take on 'the city' that you think mark them out?

* Conversely

* Are there examples of cultures observably encountering cities when they possessed no similar concept of their own

While most people with even a rudimentary historical education have heard of the Big 3 marquee names in Mesoamerica -- the Olmecs, Zapotec, Otomi, and Mixtec. Though these groups may be separated by many hundreds of kilometers and centuries, if not millennia, far too often they are presented as a homogenous melange of anachronisms. Throw in the Andean cultures even further removed, and you get the pop-culture mish-mash that is the [Mayincatec](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec).

The shallow popular understanding and the seeming strangeness of cultures that developed wholly removed from the influence of Eurasian and African peoples, Mesoamerica has been a [frequent topic on AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/nativeamerican) and the reason for this AMA. So please feel free to ask any question, simple or complex, on your mind about this much misunderstood region and its peoples.

I’m a cultural historian, and laws were passed against it in 1857). My geographical focus is Europe, especially Great Britain, but I also know a good amount about Anthony Comstock and his crusade. In a sense, I deal with the ‘prehistory’ of pornography.  


History of the Book is a much more established field, although it has been recently criticized, remains a pioneer work. The History of Pornography is still a relatively new field, especially the ‘prehistory’ subfield of it, and no program exists specifically studying it.

The author's claim is that India was always inclusive

&gt; This is the first and foremost thing to learn about India that there is not, according to European ideas, any sort of unity – physical, political, social and religious, no Indian nation, no ‘people of India’

Is there validity to the claim that India was a single inclusive nature of religious and cultural diversity and that the Europeans simply could not understand it

Films from the beginning of the ""talkies"" up until about the mid to late 60's have an especially different flavor.  The dialogue is more formal, faces don't seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression.  Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind them.

My personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater, a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater, causing them to shift to a more naturalistic style.

*The term cobra effect stems from an anecdote set at the time of British rule of colonial India. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi.[3] The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, the reward program was scrapped, causing the cobra breeders to set the worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse*

Something very similar happened under French rule in Indochina but with rats instead of snakes. While the rat version of the story seems to have historical proof (though I'm no too sure - my French is a bad joke and I just assumed the sources were good because they looked fancy) I didn't find any for the Cobra version.

&gt;""Phineas, who taught him surveying. Equipped with an old compass once the property of his great grandfather, Phineas Ball practiced surveying as opportunity offered, but until his employment by the Nashua and Worcester railroad 1847, he had seen no surveying done by men of experience. He taught several terms of school and finally settled in Worcester. In April 1849 he became associated with Elbridge Boyden under the firm of Boyden &amp; Ball architects and engineers. His field books covering a period of twenty five years show how closely he was identified with the growth of the city. He was an engineer of great ability. He patented a number of appliances used in connection with the construction of water works. He became a member of the Worcester County Mechanics Association serving with great acceptance in the various offices. In 1862-3 he served the city in the common council was mayor in 1865 from 63 to 67 was water commissioner and from 67 to 72 was city engineer. For thirty one years he was deacon of the First Unitarian Church and for seven years president of the Worcester County Conference of Unitarian Churches. He was a member of the Worcester County Society of Engineers and the American Water Works Association and was also a member of the Worcester Society of Antiquity. He was married (first) December 21 1848 to Sarah Augusta Holyoke. Two children were born to them: a son who died in 1857, and a daughter [who] survives. He married (second) Mary Jane Otis of Lancaster.""",,,,

Now, downvoting a newcomer's post for no reason makes us look like some gated off community on an ivory tower,  which isn't really the purpose of this subreddit.

If a question is too broad (what happened in pre-Colombian America?), and if you don't feel like doing any of the actions mentioned above, just leave the question there undownvoted.

Just after the fall of France there were serious efforts by Germans to negotiate a 'Generous' peace

1.) Allowing the British army to evacuate at Dunkirk without catastrophic losses could be seen as a gesture of 'good will'.

2.) Flight of Rudolph Hess could have been ordered by Hitler with the planned deniability in case his mission failed. 

3.) Even in Mein Kampf and at other times

British ultimately won the war but in effect lost its empire and bankrupted itself. 

**Update**
The above 3 aren't the peace offers but are serious hints to the German desire of peace with British. I have read that there was considerable effort from German side

**Update 2: Hitler's 'generous' peace offer:**

Hitler offered **total cessation of the war in the West**. Germany would evacuate all of France except Alsace and Lorraine, Hitler offered to withdraw from Western Europe, except for the two French provinces and Luxembourg *[Luxembourg was never a French province, but an independent state of ethnically German origin]*, in return for which Great Britain would agree to assume an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards Germany as it unfolded its plans in Eastern Europe. In addition, the *Führer* was ready to withdraw from Yugoslavia and Greece. German troops would be evacuated from the Mediterranean generally and Hitler would use his good offices to arrange a settlement of the Mediterranean conflict between Britain and Italy. No belligerent or neutral country would be entitled to demand reparations from any other country, he specified.

The proposal contained many other points

**Disclaimer**
I am still learning and *could be wrong about anything*. The *'generous offer'* this post describes is poorly sourced from lurking in few internet forums(*I told you I am just an amateur!*) and without a proper source **should be considered conjuncture**. To support the hypothesis, Hess's flight and Hitler's attitude towards the British from his writings and speeches; but such hints aren't proof.

The movie was good and from what I hear historically accurate.  But I think the ""historically accurate"" part might be being attributed to more technical history, events, etc.  Culturally and as an image of politics, ""accurate"" might be subjective, but this movie was disappointingly heroifying Lincoln.  I know, what else should I have expected, but I wanted to see at least some character flaws and some nods to the fact that good and evil in politics are not binaries and this movie really did reinforce that.

So am I wrong?  Was Lincoln really this abolitionist champion?  What was his attitude towards individual slaves?  Was he really a kind hearted sympathizer who is portrayed as America's Grandpa?  What I mean by that is that he just was portrayed as so kind and soft spoken.  I'm sure that in the 19th c. atmosphere of bellowing orators he seemed that way,False,,t5_2ssp3,False,,other,t3_132izd

1338772858.0,ujf7c,[Meta] New r/askhistorians official policies.,Artrw,231,31,80,"I. Posting

Every post must be one of three things, or a [Meta] post. Anything that is not one of these three things are to be reported and subsequently deleted.

	1A. Questions

Questions should be regarding history, if you are asking whether Nixon was a “good president” or not, try to define what you mean by good. Try to define a time period if the question is ambiguous. History is typically define as 20 years old or older. Anything newer than this should be reported, and will be judged upon case by case. Also, questions should be about what *did* happen, not what *could have* happened. Questions of that type should be posted in r/historicalwhatif.

	1B. AMAs

AMAs cannot take place except when approved by the moderators. AMAs are for either famous historians (authors, either by a picture of yourself including I.D. and a sign saying, “Hi, r/askhistorians”, or a post on an official twitter/facebook page. Other methods of verification can be discussed if these do not work. 

	1C. [Meta]s

Any post about the workings/policies of the subreddit should be made with a [Meta] tag. Do NOT make a [Meta] post about whether something is allowed or not

II. Commenting

There are two types of comments

	2A. Top-Tiered

Top-tiered comments should only be answers to the question at hand. Memes, or other unhelpful words are not permitted (exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment). Sources are *HIGHLY, HIGHLY* recommended, but not absolutely required (other restrictions apply for flaired users—see below). 

	2B. Non Top-Tiered

Comments that are not in the top-tier are much less restricted. Comments should still have a purpose—if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they may still be deleted

III. Flair

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area. Flaired users are held to a higher standard than other users. Flaired users commenting outside their topic area will be treated as normal users. 

	3A. Applying for Flair

Applying for flair takes place in the Panel post, including sources. At least one of the comments should be in your given topic area. If you have an obscure specialty, contact the moderators for alternative methods of verification.

	3B. Flaired Expectations

Users with flair must have two things—
1.	An *extensive* knowledge of their topic area
2.	The ability to convey their historical knowledge in a way that is understandable to a person with little-to-no historical background knowledge.
Flaired users which consistently fail to meet these expectations should be reported to the moderators via mod mail.

IV. Banning

	4A. Reasons

You can be banned for repetitively and wantonly violating the in sections one or two. You should receive a warning before an official ban

You can also be banned for being a spambot

	4B. Appeals

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, you can contact me directly.


These rules are subject to change at any time. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.

The account appears suspect as it relies primarily on circumstantial evidence and takes a lot of interpretive license. However, history is not my field


Someone asked ""Why has Sub-Saharan Africa been so historically weak?""
Multiple factors appear to play a role in this tragedy:


-The geographic isolation of sub-Saharan Africa also results in genetic isolation. For obvious reasons there has been little population exchange across the Sahara for most of history. Genetic studies show that many beneficial mutations that emerged in Eurasia never reached sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these beneficial mutations are related to personality differences and the formation of complex societies. As an example, relatively common among Europeans, and very rare among sub-Saharan Africans.


-Climatic differences. Seasonal climates tend to be associated with the development of civilization, as the winter is a season in which hunting would be important, which is difficult for women who have young children to take care off. In a warmer climate, women can be largely self-sufficient throughout the year, and women can focus on finding a ""stud"", that is, a man who carries good genes but shows no interest in taking care of a child.


-Lethal diseases, as immigrants do not have the genetic adaptations to survive in an environment that hosts malaria.


-The founder effect in non-Africans. The founder effect is believed to play a major role in speciation. Homo Floriensis shows that humans are no exception to this rule. According to Wikipedia,000 individuals in Africa, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the Red Sea. Today Africa is still the continent with the largest human genetic diversity on the planet.

Non-African groups can therefore be expected to have shed certain genetic polymorphisms that still occur in sub-Saharan Africans and can destabilize a society. The most important thing for civilization is internal social cohesion. Genetic polymorphisms that are still common in Africa such as MAOA-2R make it difficult to maintain internal social cohesion, except to sub-Saharan Africa. At this moment it is not yet known what the effects of this polymorphism are, but we do know that this gene has been under significant positive selection. Similarly, new derived versions of ASPM related to tone perception did not spread to sub-Saharan Africa.


-Some believe that Arab slave trade before contact with Europeans may have played a role, as opposed to the other way around.

=-=-=-=

**I. Submissions**

Every submission in /r/askhistorians must be one of five things:

- An actual question
- A [META] post
- An AMA post
- A daily project post
- A special occasion post

**Questions** are just that: questions.  Users should make every effort to ensure that their questions are clear

**[META] posts** are about the state and process of the subreddit; e.g. ""[META] We need to talk about downvotes""; ""[META] We now have 40

**AMA posts** are mod-approved ""ask me anything"" submissions from flaired users, and only with mod approval.

**Daily project posts** are those catch-all posts that appear each day of the week on [the schedule determined here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/x9c4e/meta_new_projects_incoming/).  Only mods may make them.

**Special occasion posts** draw attention to an occurrence or anniversary that would serve as good grounds for general discussion.  [See an example here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/y94fc/special_occasion_post_243rd_birthday_of_napoleon/).  Such posts can be about anniversaries, but **only after receiving mod approval**.

If a submission in /r/askhistorians does not fit into one of the five above categories

**I(a). Further Question Guidelines**

Questions should be historical, archives and museums in your field of research?""). 

Try to be specific; if you are asking whether Nixon was a “good president” or not

Try to define a time period if the question is ambiguous. For the purpose of discouraging too much speculation about current events

Anything focused on events after 1992 should be reported to the moderating team

Additionally:

- Questions should be about what did happen

- While we welcome questions about mysterious objects you may have found

- Might your question be more appropriate for /r/asksocialscience?  They'd be glad to receive it

- Book reviews and requests for same might fruitfully be directed to /r/historyresources/.

**II. Commenting**

There are two types of comments: *top-tiered* and *non-top-tiered*. [Here is a graphic](http://i.imgur.com/vZveY.png) showing what is meant by these terms.  Each type of comment is governed by different rules.

**II(a). Top-Tiered Comments**

Top-tiered comments should *only* be serious responses to whatever the thread is about.  If it's a question, worthwhile points of discussion.  In all cases, it is permitted to ask additional questions to clarify the OP's submission or to follow it up. 

Memes, or other unhelpful comments are *not permitted*, though exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment.  The answers provided in /r/askhistorians should be informed, comprehensive, serious and courteous -- that is, they should be such that a reader would depart feeling as though he or she had actually learned something.

Sources in top-tiered comments are not an absolute requirement at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive, please think twice before answering in the first place.

**II(b). Non-Top-Tiered Comments**

Comments that are not in the top-tier are less restricted.

Non-top-tiered comments should still have a positive purpose -- if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they will still be deleted.  Nevertheless, and will be moderated with a somewhat lighter hand.

**II(c). On Speculation**

We welcome informed, while this is a public forum it is not an egalitarian one; not all answers will be treated as having equal merit. Please ensure that you only post answers that you can substantiate, if asked, and only when you are certain of their accuracy. 

It is perfectly acceptable to ask a follow-up question of your own if you aren't sure about something

**II(d). Posts from Novelty Accounts and Bots**

Bots will be banned on sight

Users may post from novelty accounts provided they do not do so ""in-character.""  This applies both to accounts with a particular gimmick (only posts one word, then in a ban.

**III. Flair**

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area.  The different sub-sections of flair can be found in the coloured list in the sidebar.

**III(a). Applying for Flair**

Applying for flair takes place in the current Panel post

**III(b). Flaired Expectations**

Users with flair must have two things:

1. An extensive knowledge of their topic area

2. The ability to convey their historical knowledge in a way that is understandable to a person with little-to-no historical background knowledge. 

Flaired users are held to a higher standard.  They must be polite, but they will be treated just like any other user when they do so.

Flaired users who fail to meet the above expectations should be reported to the moderators.

**III(c). Non-Flaired Expectations**

We welcome the participation of non-flaired users so long as it conforms to all of the above rules.  It is especially important for us to allow such participation given that it is one of the chief ways in which we can find out which non-flaired users should be given flair at all.  Nevertheless

It is true that /r/askhistorians is not a peer-reviewed journal or graduate seminar

**III(d). Conduct for All Users**

Regardless of flair, or other forms of bigotry, no matter your credentials.

**IV. Discipline**

Those who break the rules outlined above will likely find themselves under scrutiny.  Disciplinary actions on the moderators' part come in three forms:

- Gentle reminders
- Formal warnings
- Bannings

**Gentle reminders** will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.

**Formal warnings** will be delivered for especially grievous infractions

**Bannings** are reserved for users who:

- Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction
- Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can't respond at all; we're quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)
- Are clearly trolls
- Engage unrepentantly in racist
- Are spammers
- Are bots -- even relatively benign ones

**IV(b). Appeals**

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted

These rules are subject to change at any time

This was a growing pain. We did not do our due diligence in vetting the account. In the future, after all? What's at stake here aside from the goodwill of a community?

This is now a thing, and I think we can certainly expect to be trolled again in the future

They are made of some pliable metal (gray base you see on the coins), which is not very well coated. Some of the coins don't have that coating anymore.

Front of the coin: There is what seems to me as some very very old Indian goddess on the front of the coin. He/She is holding a trident in one hand and MAYBE a sword of some sort in the other.

Back of the coin: There is nothing there

A few questions: 
1. How do I get these dated? Are there any places in Arizona?
2. Has anyone ever seen anything similar to this before?
3. Can someone provide some more information on these?

I personally think that these are Pre-Mughal era coins and based on the material used for the coins

*Edit after 5 month: Read a bit of Modern world, the Great Divergence and looked into China A History, as well as Orientalism and the Power Broker. It is much harder to read some works because they are very dense (looking at Pomeranz. However, I have to say that it is quite interesting and changed how I look on the state of affairs. Why the West rules, for now is an excellent introduction piece.*

The mods are not interested in hearing about it, just downvote the post to hell. You can even comment a little reminder to maintain decorum if you so please, don’t bother reporting it. I’m just going to accept it.

Not making racist, we here at r/askhistorians like to hold ourselves to a higher standard than lots of other subreddits.

Everyone is here because this is subs goal is to achieve a higher standard of discussion of history.  It won't always be perfect as Artfw and I do not want to delete, our way through this sub; that's not what we are here for.  I have added another bullet point to the sidebar: no name calling, no insults.  I expect a few frustrated exclamations from time to time, but calling someone an ""asshole"" for example is simply not allowed.

Going forward

/u/lukeweiss can cover the Daoist tradition
Before you ask, from notable scholar Steven R. Bokenkamp](http://public.wsu.edu/~paths/bokenkamp-faq.html). Or just ask away!!  

/u/FraudianSlip can talk about both the early texts of the Dao and the early confucian texts. He specializes in Song (960-1279 CE) intellectual history. FraudianSlip will begin an MA in Chinese History in the Fall. [see FraudianSlips's profile HERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/fraudianslip)

/u/Grass_Skirt can talk about Chan [Zen] historiography, iconography and art history, book culture, Buddhist-Daoist syncretism.  He is a PhD candidate with a background in Sinology. He is your go-to on the panel for Buddhism in China.  

lastly, he specializes in Buddhist history as well.

That's why the upvote button is there; good questions that a lot of people are interested in are made more visible and are more likely to get answered because of it. But downvoting a question is *actively reducing* the chance that it will get answered. We feel that there's no good reason to go that far. If a question isn't related a history

So we've decided to trial disallowing downvotes for questions. For the next couple of weeks, we'll consider making it a permanent change. It will also inform an ongoing behind-the-scenes discussion on further changes to the subreddit style, aimed at promoting high quality comments and upvoting/downvoting for the right reasons (any ideas on this are welcome).

We also want to hear from the wider community on this one: is this a good idea? Are there other ways that we can promote original questions on lesser-known subjects?
