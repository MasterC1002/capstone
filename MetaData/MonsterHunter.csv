I spent all night thinking about making a monster hunter database, weapons, and combo lists. It would be able to tell you what items you needed to craft / upgrade and such. 

It would use SQLEXPRESS and C# to accomplish all this.

Would /r/MonsterHunter be interested in this? If so

I will probably parse the strategy guide's text and insert them into a database

**Foreword:**

Hello, write, hunt dragons, bake stuff, and love coffee &amp; tea.

I've been hunting since MH2 back in '06. Every time a MH title came out

With each version I'd usually be the one buying the Nintendo Weekly/ Dengeki Playstation magazines and translating information en masse - usually when the release dates draw near.

I did this for P2, a bit for 3G, and now a copy of the June issue of Dengeki Nintendo is on my table - Tigrex is staring at me from the cover.

I've never been a fan of community segregation - honestly I wished JP and EN servers can just all be mixed together

Wishful thinking aside, and since I usually choose only one site to translate on, this time round I thought reddit would be a more widely-accessible platform as, say, a random forum on the net somewhere.

- - -
**Translation Ethic:**

While I have enough knowledge of Japanese to live and work in Japan

I would also like to say that I work on these things at my own pace. If someone else is able to translate faster and wants to start their own thread/ merge info, so I'd appreciate it if I don't get bombarded with ""WHEN MOAR?!?!?"" and the like. 

As such I hope to be able to work on this at my leisure as I sip my tea at night (and maybe after some hunts!). While I won't disappear wholesale

I can be reached for further inquiries @ateliershirley on twitter

- As seen in trailers and information released about MH4 so far, and said geography can also be destroyed to bring about even more variation to the hunting field. 

**[The New ""Wall Movement"" System]**

- Up until now, hunters can attack with their **Hunting Knife** (your carving knife), perform evasive maneuvers, and use items! 

- However

**[""Jump Attack"" and ""Mount Attack!"" An all-new way to tear your favourite wyverns apart!]**

- As mentioned above, with the system promoting a kind of ""smooth movement"" between the high and low ground. 

- After jumping

- Pressing the X button in mid-jump will initiate the jumping attack. This attack differs by weapon. For more information on jump attacks

- Mount attacks are a special kind of attack which causes the hunter to attach him/herself to the back of a large wyvern monster (there goes my Jaggi riding dreams). 

- The Mount attack is initiated when the Jump attack connects with certain points (hitboxes

- A Mount attack gauge will be visible upon successful initiation. If the gauge depletes

- As no one likes to be mounted and repeatedly stabbed

- **[Basic Event Flow]**: Find High Ground &gt; Proclaim **""I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!!""** &gt; Jump off to demonstrate your superiority &gt; Press X to jump attack &gt; Hit the monster's back


**[The ""Berserker Wyvern Virus"" System]**

*""The Berserker Wyvern Virus! A rage above rage mode?! And it affects hunters too?!""*

- Much has changed in the world of MH4

- This virus changes their appearance

- A sure-fire way to tell if a wyvern has been infected is to look at its eyes! Infected wyverns become enveloped by a purple cloud/ aura

- If the wyvern already HAS red

- The origins of the Berserker Wyvern Virus are still unknown

- Even wyverns that we are familiar with gain new attacks and unpredictable movement patterns

**[The Berserker Virus and You]**

- When a Hunter is hit by certain attacks of an infected wyvern, will be infected by the Virus.

- However

- An ""Infection Gauge"" will appear beneath the hunter's name upon taking an infection-capable attack. If the hunter continues taking attacks from the monster

- However

- This effectively translates to: **""Beat the living** *censored* **out of the fool that bit you""**. After landing enough attacks on the target

- In **BERSERKER MODE** (for emphasis, allowing them to land more critical hits. The statistics on this buff are as of yet, not known.

- It is worth noting that the hunter loses all natural recovery ability when infected with the Virus. 

- Confirmed wyverns that carry the infection: **RATHIAN, CONGALALA, TIGREX, KUCHYAWACHA.** HRH Yian Kut-Ku's attendance remains to be seen.


**[Viruses? Is this Resident Monster now?!]**

- The spread of the Berserker Wyvern Virus has apparently been rapid

- Wyverns can be already infected

- It is not known if ""Free Hunt"" monsters can suddenly become infected as well.

- The origins of this virus can only be traced to ""Tigrex"". So far not much is known about the virus, infections for everyone and all that.

 [Magara Page 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8824998242/) | 

- A dark wyvern that has ""sensing scales"". It is able to determine the position of the hunter by using said scales - they apparently read changes in body temperature in the wyvern's surroundings.

The Felynes are back

That being said, from what I see. 

There's also a ""Felyne Rocket"" attack which involves a high-propulsion Acorn-Rocket... designed to smash into its target and explode.

1363974802.0,1at7qw,A Monster Hunter 3U guide for new players,adremeaux,172,24,110,"Here are some tips for noobs that should help you get a handle on the game faster

**First off:** ~~do your weapon tutorial.~~ (edit: apparently this game no longer has weapon tutorials. wtf? Well, right away. Though the weapons don't have huge movesets like Devil May Cry or something, they have enough that you should some time memorizing all the moves of your chosen weapon. Most weapons have three kinds of moves: fast pokes, medium length attacks, and slow, heavy hitters. All of these moves are useful in different situations. Some weapons also have evasive attacks, some weapons have KO attacks, and some that have great horizontal reach. Movesets are also slightly different underwater

edit: For your moves: you'll an X attack and an A attack. Try seeing how these two basic moves combo into each other. For instance, try R moves, which are usually *special moves*. These may combo or give you powerups, or just block. In addition, some moves can charge (notably hammer and great sword). After you've got all that, check your unsheathe attacks. You'll usually have two different ones: unsheathe with X, and unsheathe with X+A. I don't know the specifics of all the weapons, and with Switch Axe you'll go straight into sword mode. **It's really an enormous shame that the game doesn't have weapon tutorials anymore**

edit edit: Hunter's Notes &gt; Hunter Info &gt; Basics &amp; Controls &gt; Weapon Guide for a written guide. Not perfect

It is up to you to know these moves

**Questing**

There are three types of quests in the game: free hunting

Free hunting involves simply leaving Moga Village and killing whatever is around the D. Island. Doing so will gain you *Resource Points* to use around the village for upgrades, and items you gather in the field can also be traded in for resources. When you've returned from your hunt, talk to the Elder's Son (the guy standing up on the box right in the middle), and pick *Hunt Report*, and this will tally up all of your kills and additional points, and you'll get some items, too. Normally, as they are resources for crafting and combining that you don't need to have on your person.

Village quests are the core of the beginning of the game. These are single player quests of modest difficulty and will ease you into the game. You get these by talking to the lady behind the booth in the north west part of town. These involve either gathering a bunch of resources

Guild quests are primarily for multiplayer, and the general difficulty of monsters you fight ramps up way faster. You really shouldn't be touching guild quests until you are comfortable with single player and at least up to 3* village quests. To access guild quests, you need to talk to the guy near the boat and travel to the *Marina* or *Tavern*. On the right side of the screen in the tavern, there are 3 people behind a counter that can give you guild quests. If you play online, you'll be getting all of your quests from here. 

**Quest info**

When a quest begins, rations, first aid med, paintballs, mini whetstones, and possibly traps or bombs, cool drinks or hot drinks*.

The *map* is straight-forward: it shows you a map of the area. This is optional

*Rations* are a critical item. The yellow bar up top is your stamina gauge. It starts out with a max of 100. If you eat a ration, it's max. **You should eat two rations at the start of every quest**. Having 150 stamina is a huge advantage, and basically free since the rations are free at the start of every quest.

While we're on the subject of rations: meat. Many monsters drop ""raw meat."" Using your BBQ spit, growing your stamina by 50. If you run out of rations or don't have any, eat a well-done steak if you need stamina. You should always carry well-done steak around with you.

*First Aid Med* is the same as a basic potion. We'll cover potions further below. 

*Paintballs* are used to mark large monsters. If you throw a paintball at a monster

*Mini-whetstones* are the same as regular whetstones. We'll talk about sharpness below.

*Hot drink* and *cold drink* are for cold and hot environments, use your your cold drink at the start and you should be fine. For the tundra, use your hot drink. If you don't use these, you'll either lose health or stamina faster.

*Sonic bombs, but if the bombs are in the supply, you may as well take them and trying throwing them when monsters are doing special things like flying or howling and seeing what happens. Barrel bombs are for straight damage; you can set them up while a monster is sleeping and detonating them by hitting them for an easy chunk of damage.

*Traps* and *tranq bombs* we'll talk about below in trapping. 

**Most supply items are automatically lost at the end of a quest**. Map, mini-whetstones, ""EZ"" bombs will be returned. However, paintballs and tranq bombs you get to permanently keep. Sweet! 

When a quest is complete

**Combining**

Combining items is key to your success in Monster Hunter. Most combinations can and should be done via the box in your home, so don't start guessing.

When you look through the list, then you can make it. Do so. Once you've made an item from the list once, the name will be revealed. You should try to make every item in the list once so you know what it is for the future. Your box has tons and tons of space, so don't worry about it running out. 

**Potions**

The most important items you can make via combining at potions. These are the first two items in the combo list: potion and mega potion. A *potion* comes from an *herb* and a *blue mushroom*, 10 mega-potions, a few well-done steaks, and some whetstones. 

**Farming**

Who the hell wants to sit around all day and gather herbs and mushrooms, mushrooms, honey, and bugs. The farm can be found via the south east exit from town. Talk to the guy up top and set your cats up to farm whatever you need. To start out, make sure you have tons of herbs and blue mushrooms, and combine them to make yourself lots of potions: you'll need them.

**Fishing**

You'll soon get fishing boats, others can be traded for resources. **If you send the boats to the treasure areas, they are self-sustaining** in terms of resources used/generated. Trade your rusty parts and broken fossils or whatever to the Elder's Son for more resource points. 

Oh yeah

**Armor sets and skills**

*Your skills don't activate unless they are at least +10*. If you have +7 sharpness, *that does absolutely nothing*. Thus, you want to pursue full armor sets rather than pieces here and there. A full armor set will always get at least two skills to +10, usually three. *I recommend a Great Jaggi set to start with*. If you kill 5-10 great jaggis, you can make the full set. It's a great set. Put a few +1 attack gems in it as well to get to +15 attack for *Attack Up (M)*. 

Also, I have 99 regular armor stones and over 50 armor stone+s. 

**Sharpness**

Last part before fighting. Weapon sharpness is critical for fighting. A sharper weapon deals more damage and pierces thick enemy hides. You can see your sharpness in a sword icon below your health/stamina bar. As you attack, from green to yellow to orange to red. You should never, ever be attacking with an orange or red sharpness weapon. To resharpen, use a whetstone and you'll be back at max.

Generally

**OK

Here are some random pointers for fighting big monsters:

* If you are getting hit a lot, run in and take *a single swing* then dodge away and prep for the next attack. As you learn their patterns, you may be able to get in a couple more hits

* Hit monsters in the head for more damage.

* Sometimes, you may be able to predict flinching and use it to your advantage. 

* Pay attention to what the monster is doing, it's going to do the fire leap. **Every enemy attack has a different telegraph**, though some are more obvious than others. Learn them.

*Arzuros:*

* Easiest big monster in the game

* Don't feel safe attacking his back. He has a nasty turn-around strike. *Don't be greedy.* 

* Not much else to say for him

*Great Jaggi:*

* The original easiest monster. Be wary of his headbutt. When he howls

* When he does his tail attack

* He's relatively quick

*Quropeco:*

* The first real tough fight in the game. Has a lot more health than Great Jaggi.

* When he claps twice slowly (TAP—TAP) he's about to do his fire leap

* If you are on fire

* He does his tail spin twice in a row.

* When he is flying

* When he puffs up his red thing and starts dancing from side to side and clapping

* You are relatively safe right in front of him

* Wings/flints require green sharpness to pierce.

*Barroth:*

* The true trial for most players.

* Do not fight him with a weapon without green sharpness

* Unless you are a hammer

* When he shakes himself out, or you can just wait about 10 seconds and it will go away. Generally, when he shakes it's worth the risk of running in for a few free hits because mud isn't that bad.

* You can break mud off his body parts, it won't come off that part when he shakes out.* So if you break the mud off his rear, when he shakes out you can freely run in and strike without worrying about getting muddy.

* After his charge attack

* Pretty much all of this guy needs green sharpness to pierce,False,self,t5_2rron,1363988675.0,,LSU,t3_1at7qw

The other moderators and I have been seeing a lot of posts lately with a ""report"" filed on it. The problem with this is, meaning the community has deemed it relevant/funny/informational/accurate or otherwise worthy of being here.

I know some people are unhappy with meme's making their way to our subreddit. I know some people are unhappy with how many people are receiving Rathian Plates (or rubies or gems or whatever else). But your way of showing displeasure at these posts is the downvote button

[Please refer to this link for information on Reddit's ""report"" button](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reporting). 

As you can see, ""My City is STILL not letting be mayor because I use dial-up"".

As of my last perusal of our subreddit

If memes become a problem here like they did in /r/pics before /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu was created, they seem to be a variety of different memes.

Also, then feel free to exercise your right to downvote. It's a decision that has to be made my the community, not by one unhappy person with a ""report"" button.

I also wish to keep any policing by the mods at a minimum. I want our subreddit to be open to any hunter, informational or gloating or otherwise. /r/MonsterHunter is a place for everyone and everything that has anything to do with Monster Hunter. It's up to you to decide who gets front-page face time!

**A Strange Breed** *(Requires HR3)* - Hunt two Baleful Gigginox in the Land Arena for a material to craft [Rising Soul](http://images.wikia.com/monsterhunter/images/1/10/RisingSoul-SS.jpg), a Hunting Horn, with Red/Green/White notes on its unupgraded form, and Red/Green/Purple on the upgraded counterpart. (I can't actually find a picture of, just imagine this one with the same color scheme as Rising Soul.) Both of these weapons have decent raw, and good Lightning damage, as well as 3 sockets when they have been upgraded. One note for this quest if you're going solo - be careful, these two will combo the crap out of you. Absolutely not saying this out of experience after being carted.

**Herald of Prosperity** *(Requires HR8)* - Hunt a G-Rank Jhen Mohran. Fairly straightforward, but my slacker self is still HR7.) Any input from those able to do this quest would be appreciated.

Remember that these quests must be started from the tavern in Port Tanzia

1369810526.0,1f97ld,"""New to Gunning"" FAQ",CirnoMcFairy,107,14,31,"**0. What is this?**

On the IRC channel I got asked a lot about using bowguns for the first time.  I realized I was basically saying the same thing over and over, this might be for you.

(Disclaimer: None



**1. Why would I want to shoot a bowgun?**

Bowguns are a satisfying weapon to play right and are extremely versatile.  They're unique in that you can be doing elemental damage, a bowgun can completely trivialize encounters and be a massive asset to the blademasters.  In exchange for their unique properties, you suffer increased vulnerability, complexity, and emphasis on positioning.


**2. Do I want to use a Heavy or Light bowgun?**

I'd say use both!  I think Heavy is better for raw damage and Light better for status and elemental, but use an LBG for the Raths and Diablos.


**3. Okay

Hold on, you're going to want to pick a shot type to focus on.


**4. What do you mean

Like I said, and status (among more niche things), but you generally want to pick one type of shot.  Think of it like this: as a blademaster, you build an armor set to work with a weapon.  Well, bowguns ammo is like having lots of smaller ""weapons"" you work around.  You can pick a bowgun that fires that shot type well and build an armor set around that one.


**5. I don't know the different ammo types.**

These are the major six.

Normal: Raw.  As basic as it gets.  Ideal range is as close as possible.  Normal 3 bounces!

Pierce: Raw.  Pierces through monster and hits multiple times.  Ideal range is about 2-3 rolls away.

Pellet: Raw.  It's a shotgun!  Do not use online

Crag/Clust: Raw.  The explosives.  Crag sticks and blows up

Element: Flame/Freeze/Thunder/Water/Dragon.  Self-explanatory.  Doesn't seem affected by range at all.  Dragon S sucks.

Status: Para/Sleep/Poison.  Extremely potent.  A decent status gun can paralyze the same monster three times.  Any range.


**6. Six things!?  My mind is broken!  Which do I use!?**

Depends on the monster.  Normal and Pellet are pretty okay on anything.  Pierce against big/long jerks where the bullet can do all the hits it possibly can.  The appropriate element for the monster

Normal is easy to use because one set and you're mostly done.  Element's also easy to understand but you'll want several guns and perhaps armor sets to work with it.  Status is a little trickier


**7. How do I know this is a good bowgun to use for a shot type?**

First

Does it have enough recoil to fire the shots at the fastest rate?  There's charts for this

Can it reload the shots at maximum speed?  If it can't

Does it have deviation?  If the deviation is only to the left or right, you might want to skip that bowgun.


**8. What armor skills should I get?**

Amusingly, the appropriate damage up (or status up), other luxury skills as wanted beyond that.  If you have a gunning armor set already, you can just grab a bowgun that most closely matches it.
Luxury skills for bowgunning include the evasion+s, and, well it's more of a personal niche preference of my own, Combination Pro for normal gunning.


**9. Ah

These are what I used while playing


**Low Rank**

Peco: I started with this over Jaggi because Pellet Up is very strong

Wroggi: Normal Up

Rathalos: Yes, pretty solid LR pierce set.  Can gem in Fire Atk if you're into that.


**High Rank**

Wroggi: Guess who's back, tell a friend.

Steel Uragaan: Knockout King and Artillery make this especially hilarious to use with the Demon's Isle gun.  Crag away!

Azure Rathalos: A solid Normal Up set with earplugs.

Jhen Mohran: Has Pierce Up and Defense Up.  I used this through the end of HR and ultimately took on Goldbeard with it.


**G Rank**

If you're at this point you should be probably mixing sets since a lot of g rank sets aren't good on their own IMO.  Most of them have Load Up over any specific shot-type up.

Azuros: No

Nibelsnarf: Looks fairly stylish!  Also has Pierce Up.  If you had a freeze gun to farm Azuros you're ready to farm this guy.

Green/Nargacuga: Not fantastic on their own

Abyssal Lagiacrus: Notable for having Silver Bullet, go for it.


**Bowguns:**

Thundacrus (LBG): Rapid-fires Thunder and Paralysis

God's Isle (LBG): This fucking thing.  It shoots Crag and Clust and Status and other shit you get it from ancientshards.  I don't like it but it's apparently good

Jaggid Fire (LBG): Before you can enter High Rank to get the Nargacuga line

Blizzard Cannon (LBG): Rapid Freeze


Nargacuga Line (LBG/HBG): I prefer the HBG.  The definitive pierce gun.


Ceadeus Line (HBG): This line of HBGs is my preferred for firing Normal.  It has a strong left deviation

Queen's/Empress Line (HBG): The alternative gun for Normal, which is a point in its favor over the Ceadeus line.

Jhen Cannon (HBG): Okay

Tropeco Gun (HBG): This line fires Normal, eventually adding Thunder and Para to it.  Reliable and once it's upgraded to have Thunder, you can shoot two of the most common elemental weaknesses with some backup paralysis.  An HBG that'll last you all the way into G Rank.


Again, were simple to use as far as bowguns go, and relatively easy to farm.  By the time you figured things out enough to disgaree with any of this, you're already beyond the scope of this FAQ.


**10. Wait!  What about the whole ""how to shoot a bowgun"" bit?**

What's there to say?  You roll and shoot.  Use third or first person view if you need to hit upwards a little (personally I spend a lot of time in first person view

There's no fancy tricks, and a little bit of aiming.  Go shoot guns to understand them, but hopefully this gets you past the worst of it.


**11. Well

Heavy bowgun shields don't need a shield button OR auto-guard: if you're in position you just get to do it.  For limiters, but you'll reach a point where you can eventually make the call for yourself and come up with viable strategies.  Elder dragons like Ceadeus and Jhen get their shit pushed in by Pierce shots because the pierce hits happen extremely fast for some reason.  Status seriously owns, use it.  Using armor skills to remove deviation is usually a waste.

Personally any ammo I can buy at the store I don't keep in my storage box because it's a waste of precious item box space.  Combination Pro is fun with Normal 2 because it gets you 4 ammo every combine, combines for your main shot becomes increasingly important at High Rank and nigh-essential in G Rank.

LBGs sheathe fast enough, and Recov usually aren't worth using but you can give them a try when the blademasters are busy sharpening or whatever.  All three can affect the monster, so watch your damn aim.  

For a good time, bring combines, have 3 blademaster friends and triple-paralyze a silver or gold Rath, laughing your way to gleem and mantles.  Don't ever fucking use pellet online but if you're a badass like me you can aim pellet in such a way that it doesn't hit the blademasters anyway, this takes intense knowledge of pellet's cone of fire.  Ignore everything but the first six words of that last sentence.

Most importantly: always blame your team.",self,t5_2rron,1369811833.0,,HBGU,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1f97ld/new_to_gunning_faq/

1365133999.0,1bpngx,Why I love Monster Hunter.,TolerableGrammar,95,12,59,"Lately, and pfft

I made this decision after fighting Tigrex for the first time.

The biggest thing that I love about the monsters are their personalities. Everything from their nuances to their terrifying roars makes me fall in love with the hunt. 

The Qurupeco seems harmless and even charming, your heart starts rushing with fear and excitement, especially when you manage to roll away at the last second.

The Barroth is the first real intimidating monster

The Aoshira/Azuros is endearing in his actions. He's just a honey-loving bear that's just wandering around, invade his sunny, peaceful day. What really drives in this feeling is his limping escape. He desperately looks behind to see if you're following him. I feel so bad every time I kill him :(

On the other hand, and motions are inherently inhuman, and I hate it. The alien-like behavior of this monster disgusts me, especially its egg sac laying, eugh. I feel so proud to remove this parasite from the world.

The Nargacuga is an impressive combination of serpent, the Narga really will bat you around, and he seems like he's merely toying with you. The most impressive thing about him, however, is his scream. The mix of a roar and a howling scream along with blazing red eyes, you know this kitty dragon means business.

The Tigrex. My god. I've seen streams of people hunting DevilJho, and he seems so stomach driven. When he enters rage mode though, shit really hits the fan. His roars *physically damage you*. I couldn't get over that. Plus, when he's in rage mode, he's rampaging all over the area snapping, spinning, crushing, and smashing at light speed. Honestly

I honestly cannot wait to experience the next monsters lying in wait for me. I love seeing the rich ecology that MH puts out

[This thread by supersonic159](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/19l95j/can_we_decide_on_a_reddit_group_of_gates_to_use/) got me thinking about an idea I originally had two years ago with the release of Monster Hunter Tri. I'll lay out the vision for you

Vision: You sit down to play some MH3U. You could play some delicious single player, but what about those times when you don't know anyone online? A while ago, I tried to organize a couple gates specifically for reddit users to check first, see if anyone is there, and then move on if no one was online. But the post got lost in reddit obscurity, as is the nature of things. Here's what I want to do: a website that you can go to that has a graphical representation of all the gates on Monster Hunter. You log in with your hunter name, and navigate to a specific gate, at a glance, and (ideally)

This is a fundamentally different system than posting on this subreddit or /r/MonsterHunterMeetup. Posting to the subreddit means your competing for views like anyone else, and then you have to figure out how to communicate further to meet up, both where and when.

This idea means you can see, and you can join that ""chat room"" at any time. Starting it here on reddit, and linking it here, means this is an easy way to join hunts with other redditors.

Implementation: My first idea was hosting a website via Amazon Web Services. I would personally pay for the hosting, and this would operate in the same manner, but also allowing voice communication. The only problem i see is the need for a separate program, and sharing of IP's and ports, etc etc.

I would love anyone's input on this idea!! I especially would like to hear from anyone with any sort of website building experience, or java, or something else. That why I need some input!

Thanks for reading everyone!

edit: more feature ideas: WTB/WTS board, regardless of gate location

Edit: I need people with experience creating websites. I think it should be HTML5 based so it's mobile-friendly. Any takers?",self,t5_2rron,1362410659.0,,SAU,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/19m2kw/i_want_to_form_the_reddit_hunting_club/

Basically, the jaggi chestpiece can have 3 attack on it. You'll notice you'll get charms with skills on it like +7teamleader -1 sharpness or something. 

These skillpoints are 100% worthless and do absolutely nothing for you.
The way it works is that you need to accumulate 10 of the skillpoint in order to activate the skill. For instance

So every set of gear will have various skillpoints and often times you will need to wear the entire set to get all the skillpoints. Most sets come with a downside. If your downside is -10 skillpoints in health

low and behold

anyways

im at 9 hours and steam roll my way with leather armor through 4* quests upgrading my War Hammer as i go. I did the bullfango quest to unlock the gunlance since i felt my reaction time isnt what it used to be. 

V3rgil (my avatar) awakens... puts on his now alloy armor which is heavy for his sore back.

after some bread and milk (seriously?) i began the Lagi repel quest. im slightly concerned that this old hunter wont be able to keep up with the youngin's. his armor is old

after getting lost in the moga woods (purely intentional...) i come up behind the lagi to start the fight. my chacha charges fight for lagi... into an electric blast flying past me. (thank you buddy for your valiant sacrifice) i begin the fight with a paintball to his bead eyes. my arms have not failed me yet. 

poke

get the hell away from me vprey... i dont have time for your shennanigans... oh and thanks for tanking that electric blast... that will show you. go back and sniff some Laggia behind.

my grip is tightening and i can feel the arthritis in my hands grip the 3ds as V3rgil stabs at Lagis tail. poke

oh no

im reloading and notice he is going to body slam

up stab

V3rgil retires his lance for he knows

and its hammer time.

PS- just wanted to post this for all us older hunters out there. may your weapons never dull and may the desire sensor ever be in your favor. my late fathers bday is tomorrow. he was a former Korean war vet and since wasnt crazy enough to go into the serivce i expressed my inner warrior through martial arts and games which is something that he always supported. he bought me my first game system and was there as a rose the ranks.

he will always be missed. 

this is for you dad.

1363022001.0,1a3aq9,Charm Tables - A PSA to hunters who want decent charms,Zombiedelight,83,13,104,"There has been some controversy among the different MH communities about this issue

**Charm Tables**

The way Charm Tables work, and when you get a charm it chooses the charm from that table.  In past MH entries the table has changed each play session, so players would not be 'locked' into a specific table.  In MH3G/3U the charm tables are selected at the time of your character creation and can not be changed.  

**Cursed Tables**

There are 17 Charm tables in the game.  Most have ~21

However there are 5 'cursed' tables.  These tables have only 200-800 charms

In addition to that

**Charm Table Utility**

There is a good utility to take a look at the charm tables.  The data in it is translated from the Japanese data which I believe was datamined.  Athena made it and it works quite well:  http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/

**Capcom Confirmation**

There had been some speculation that this won't be part of 3U

**Method for determining your Table** 

There seem to be 2 ways to see what table you are in

To determine which table you are on you can either enter each talisman you find into the previously mentioned utility to determine which table you are on (may take several charms) or there is also a boat method that involves sending the fishing boat to the shallow waters a few times to analyze the results using another utility to tell which table you are on.  

To attempt 'selecting' your charm table from the start

Here are the following times:  

Time and date when the other aimed at the table is ""2012/1/21"" for all.  T1 = Table 1, and between 11 and 13 seconds.  Added strikethrough for the 5 'cursed' tables, so people didn't think they should aim for them.  

Also worth noting that wireless should be shut off

T1 00:14:11 ~ 13 

T2 02:14:39 ~ 42 

T3 00:11:28 ~ 30 

T4 00:05:47 ~ 49

To all those watching the Nintendo Direct

Since its announcement in 2011, I'd like to announce the release date for MH4.

The release date for MH4 is the 14th of September

Now

Although many of you have already heard this information

First up is the core feature of MH4: ""Elevated Action"". Hunters will be able to attack by jumping off elevated terrain

Wyverns from previous series will make an appearance too, and Congalala. They will also have new attacks based on the ""Elevated Action"" mechanic, so it will be something to look forward to.

Of course, Gararaajara, and the Tetsukabura, in addition to many other new monsters.

Weapon action has evolved too

In MH4, able to utilize the ""Hunting Bug"" to buff themselves, as well as make use of the vaulting attack to initiate jump/mount attacks on a monster. The other weapon is the Charge Axe, a ""combination"" weapon consisting of a sword and a shield. There are still many things I cannot speak about in the Charge Axe, but there will be a hands-on session on the 1st and 2nd of June, in Tokyo, Yodaiba's Aqua City. More will be revealed there!

Of course, and this function will be completely free.

We will be announcing more about these online functions at later dates

(The screen then cuts to a celebrity who is making an advertisement for the game. I will not be translating this part.)

This will be all for today's announcements. Please enjoy this information-packed trailer! It is also available for download on the 3DS Nintendo E-shop (Japan only I think).

Thank you for watching today's Nintendo Direct!

1363723879.0,1am4le,Charm Table Manipulation - A Comprehensive Guide / How To,Zombiedelight,74,3,71,"Hi Everyone

I'm posting this as a follow up to my previous thread on Charm Tables.  In order to maybe present the process in a more coherent and comprehensive way.  This is to include not only how to try for the charm table you want

Just to reiterate the locked tables were confirmed by capcom

**Choosing a Charm Table**

This is largely up to personal preference.  Visit the link above to get some idea

**Getting the Desired Charm Table**

Getting into the right table is a fairly intricate process with little room for error.  The charm table is dependent on the time you make your character at.  We don't know the exact formula for the timing

0. Make sure your game is updated so there are no unexpected delays in starting your new game.  Start the game

1. Turn off the system WiFi - To do this

2. Change the system date and time - *Have a stop watch ready!* Changing the system date and time is fairly easy under the date and time setting.  Change the date to 1/21/2012

3. Exit the system configuration after setting the time and starting the stop watch and Start MH3U.  Once in 3U

**All times are AM
The time format is Hours:Minutes:Seconds ~ Seconds.  You have a roughly 3 second window for every table.  The Strikethrough times are the 'cursed' tables which most people would avoid.  

T1 12:14:11 ~ 13

T2 02:14:39 ~ 42

T3 12:11:28 ~ 30

T4 12:05:47 ~ 49

T5 12:56:43 ~ 45

T6 12:42:17 ~ 20

T7 01:43:58 ~ 01

T8 09:25:48 ~ 51

T9 07:09:58 ~ 01

T10 12:14:43 ~ 45

T13 12:07:46 ~ 48

T14 12:17:02 ~ 05

~~T11 12:02:43~~

~~T12 12:06:41~~

~~T15 12:08:09~~

~~T16 12:13:22~~

~~T17 12:20:03~~



**Example** 

For someone who wants Table 10

**Checking / Confirming Your Table** 

There are two ways to check which table you got on.  The ""fishing boat"" method.  Or the ""mining/charm"" method.  

*Fishing Boat Method*

First, send it out to Moga Coast (One Star).  Take note of your catch and enter it into [This Site](http://mhvuze.de/3ucharm/fishEN/) *Note the site may be down or slow from too many people trying to use it at the same time due to so many people trying to do this during launch*.  This should return a page, in japanese, which will indicate which table you are on.  This method can be done in about 40 minutes with the proper quest order.  

*Mining / Charm Method*

The Charm method is more straight forward but can take much longer to narrow it down.  You need to first get a decent number of Talismans, are duplicated among many tables, so getting charms which only appear on a few tables can take some time.  This method obviously takes much longer and should probably only be used if you have already invested a good chunk of time in the game.  

You can either check them using [Athenas Table Program](http://forums.minegarde.com/topic/6766-athenas-charm-table-search-for-monster-hunter-3g-monster-hunter-3u/) or [with this Japanese website / utility (it may require japanese proficiency to use properly)](http://mh.websimu.mydns.jp/3g_oma/xxx/table.php)

I've received many requests to establish a ""default"" reddit server and lobby that we can all go to and find each other. This would remove a little of the discomfort that comes from joining random people, with little success. But our community is much larger and stronger than it was back in those days, so lets give it another shot!

So, please create your room, or search for one, in:

Free Play 2

I recommend titling the room something distinctive, if you wish to put a password on these rooms to discourage random people from joining, please make the password ""rmh"", and hopefully this will become a norm that we all follow. I'll put this info on the sidebar when I'm at an actual computer instead of AlienBlue ;)

On another note, as opposed to ##MHReddit or something along those lines. Anyways, Club Teamwork wishes to use our chat room as the destination for their users when they choose to chat on their website! 

I believe this is fantastic news. The IRC has been very active since it was implemented, and then create another chat room for their hunt specifically. The addition of users from Club Teamwork will expand the user base, providing everyone who uses it with more potential hunting partners, and a whole new source of knowledge for fledgling hunters who have questions!

* As tempting as it might be for those of you spoiled by Tanzia hunts

* Bouncebombs act like torpedoes underwater and are useful for attacking monsters at long range.

* Granny Go-To sells hot peppers and sleepyfish which when combined make energy drinks which act like rations. This is easier than farming/cooking raw meat and faster to eat.

* Nibbelsnarf has an absurd number of exploitable weaknesses. When he's submerged, you can fish him out by putting away your weapon and pressing A next to him making him even more vulnerable.

* Monsters that are submerged beneath sand are forced to surface when sonic bombs are thrown at them.

* Tanzia Chips replenish your red health bar making them useful when going up against poisonous monsters.

* When you kill a monster

* Tanzian Ale and Hairy tuna have Felyne Explorer as a fixed skill. This way

* Crouching increases gathering/carving speed. Useful for picking up ballista ammo.

* When knocked over
Junior (The chief's son) for 1500 resource points a pop.

* 3DS users can go into the title screen's option menu and turn off the 3D. This will give you a framerate boost thats higher than just turning the 3D slider off.

* While combining a large stack of items

* Quests labeled [Canteen] will give you access better food before quests.

* For lancers: holding your shield up stops your stamina regeneration. But holding your shield up while walking does NOT. This can be used to quickly regenerate stamina while defending against relentless monster attacks. (But don't take this as justification for turtling)

* Nulberries should be your primary source of income when money is tight. A fully upgraded farm using fertilizer that is cultivating nulberries can yield tens of thousands of zenny at a time. It costs 200 resource points for 10 cycles with dung. You can get free dung from an aptonoth in Tanzia port marina

* Hoard everything unless it specifically says ""Sell this item"" in the description.

* If you're unsure about what element to use against a monster

* Using a shield bash on a kelbi yields different carves than KOing one with a normal attack.

* Crag Bowguns, Greatswords, and Switchaxes, are pvp accident prone. Communicate with your team and make sure you know where to aim. Attacking at random and knocking people around is a good way to alienate other players and getting someone killed because of it is just terrible of you.

[**My gear is shown in the pictures.**](http://imgur.com/a/wrHv7)

For those that aren't familiar with those particular armor skills I'll give some explanation:

The skills ""Unshakable"" and ""Edge Master"" are very powerful skills that are only normally found on end game sets of armor and never on the same complete set. I was able to get them both on one set of armor and also complement it with the ""Evasion +1"" skill to boot!

The ""Unshakable"" skill gives:

* Reduced effects from knockdowns
* Wind Resist (Lo)
* Earplugs (Lo)
* Current Resist (Lo)

*It's important to note that the resistance skills that Unshakable gives are actually better than the normal (Lo) skill

The ""Edge Master"" skill gives:

* Attack Up (L)
* Sharpness +1

And then there is:

* Evasion +1

I also want to say that I am getting the following skills from the songs on my Hunting Horn:

* Mind's Eye
* Affinity 25%
* HG Earplugs


I feel like I have the perfect combo of Defensive and Offensive skills as well as minimizing the downtime I take from getting hit by having the knockdown reduction and Evasion +1. Another large reason is a like the play style of having those skills and how it makes the game feel faster.

And with all that I am SO excited to have this set that I wanted to show off my crowning MH3U achievement! Thanks so much for checking it out and I hope that maybe I have given you a good goal of your own to strive for!",self,t5_2rron,1367446676.0,,HHU,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1dicx4/after_hundreds_of_hours_of_playing_my_crowning/

*Charge Axe! One of the two brand-new MH4 Weapons!*

*PS: Both the Charge Axes in these images are in AXE MODE! When in ""Sword"" Mode

**[SWORD MODE]**

- The Charge Axe (not slash axe)

&gt; - When in ""Sword-Shield"" mode
&gt; - Evasion during SnS form can be done in the form of rolling and sidestepping.


**[THE CHARGE SYSTEM]**

- The Charge Axe incorporates a ""Charging mechanism"" into its systems. 
&gt; - The Charge meter is a visible meter with 5 ""Canister"" Icons on it.
&gt; - The Charge Axe can only be charged in Sword Mode. The Charged Canisters are expended by Axe Mode attacks.
&gt; - There are two glow colours

- The ""Charge Action"" button(s) must be manually pressed when the weapon glows to charge the Canisters.
&gt; - *The Charge Action button combinations are not mentioned in the article


**[OVERHEATING AND MIS-CHARGE]**

- To recap

- The weapon can only be charged in Sword Mode.
&gt; - When the weapon is charged during a yellow glow
&gt; - When the weapon is charged during a red glow

- However
&gt; - This **MIS-CHARGE** causes vulnerability frames to occur. The article officially terms it as a ""Charging Mistake"".
&gt; - Common sense indicates that this happens because there's nothing to charge into the Canisters

- Alternatively
&gt; - The weapon **OVERHEATS**.
&gt; - Overheating causes attacks to bounce when the weapon is in this state. The article does not mention if it comes with obligatory vulnerability frames or not.
&gt; - This will also cause the giant words **CHARGE** to appear on the bar

**[AXE MODE]**

- The article states that the CA is very similar to the Greatsword in terms of movement speed and evasion. Whether this means that CA users roll or not I have no idea

- When in ""Axe"" mode, the weapon deals high damage in this state, and the energy stored in the Canisters can now be used for elemental slash attacks. 

- Mode-changing can be done mid-jump or immediately after a guard as a transformation attack.

- There are different kinds of ""Canisters""
&gt; - Strong Element Canister: Capable of generating explosions of the same element as the weapon. Explosions deal elemental damage.
&gt; - Grenade Canister: Capable of dealing KO damage to a monster

- The Axe mode also has an **Elemental Slash Finisher** move
&gt; - This attack also amplifies the Canister's latent abilities
&gt; - After this attack the weapon forcibly reverts back to Sword mode
&gt; - This seems to be a one-hit affair

**[WEAPON ANALYSIS]**

- It has come to my attention that this weapon is complex and very different from the Slash Axe (Switch Axe to you guys I guess...) as we know it. This is something I've just realized thanks to redditor *KanaKuroko*'s question.

- As we know so far
&gt; - This allows for the hunter to manually initiate CHARGE
&gt; - As we know there are a total of 5 Canisters to be filled. These are used in *AXE MODE*.

- However
&gt; - This can be easily likened to the Gunlance's ""NO MORE ROUNDS
&gt; - So far this all makes sense.

- However, and attacks bounce.
&gt; - This effectively means that

- In simple English (do pardon my liberal use of bold letters)

- In EVEN simpler English
&gt; - Manage Sword Mode Glow Level
&gt; - Knowing monster patterns so they can effectively Charge without being hit
&gt; - Learn to alternate between Sword and Axe form efficiently.

- That's kinda awesome IMHO.

**[TLDR MODE]**

 - For Hunters who prefer to slash more and read less

SWORD MODE &gt; ATTACK &gt; GAIN GLOW &gt; IF YELLOW GLOW &gt; ATTACK &gt; IF RED GLOW &gt; CHARGE &gt; IF CHARGE FULL &gt; AXE MODE &gt; YOLO &gt; ELEMENTAL BURST ATTACK &gt; REVERT TO SWORD MODE &gt; REPEAT &gt; PROFIT

**[7] Exclusive Coverage: Insect Master's Rod**

 [Rod 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814210823/) |

*The Insect Master's Rod - Hunt with the Hunting Bug! A new style of gameplay.*

- The Insect Master's Rod (Or Hunting Bug Staff if you prefer)

- The defining characteristic of this weapon is its synergy with the Hunting Bug on your hand
 &gt; - It is the only weapon in the whole game to initiate jump attacks at will.
 &gt; - It is also a weapon with high mobility and movement speed.

- This weapon is able to command the iconic ""Hunting Bug"" to attack monsters

&gt; - Different monster parts apparently generate different essences.
&gt; - When a monster enters rage mode

**[INSECT CONTROL]**

- Mark monsters with Odor Rounds!

&gt; - The Insect Master's Rod can be used like a bowgun
&gt; - These Odor Rounds instruct the Hunting Bug to attack the target
&gt; - More importantly

- Hunting Bug and Essences!

&gt; - The Hunting Bug is a very
&gt; - When the Hunter marks his/her target with an Odor Round
&gt; - When its attack connects

- Hunting Bug

&gt; - When the attack of the Hunting Bug connects and successfully draws out essence
&gt; - This glow represents the kind of buff that the essence within it carries.
&gt; - The Hunting Bug can then be called to return to you. It is worth noting that until Mr. Bug completes its landing sequence

- The Essence Buffs

&gt; - There are **FOUR** different kinds of essences available for use.
&gt; - **WHITE: Movement Speed Up**
&gt; - **RED: Attack Up**
&gt; - **ORANGE: Defense Up**
&gt; - **GREEN: Health Recovery**

- The Insect Master's Rod is meant to be used with the Hunting Bug in combos often. If one controls the weapon properly it is possible to remain buffed throughout the entire fight. 

&gt; - In a sense, and only affects the Hunter.

**[VAULTING ATTACKS]**

- By stabbing the Rod into the ground

- While other weapons have to make use of elevated ground to initiate jump attacks

- This vaulting jump can be used as a means of evasion

- If MH had a parkour kit this weapon would basically be it.

- The vaulting jump can also be chained into a powerful overhead downswing.

&gt; - If this downswing connects with certain parts of a monster

**[WEAPON ANALYSIS]**

- There's really not much to be said about the Insect Hunter's Rod at this point in time.

- What we do know states that this weapon is:

&gt; - Fast and mobile
&gt; - Able to vault over monsters
&gt; - Able to buff the Hunter by Hunting Bug Attacks
&gt; - Hinted to involve fast combos.

- Not much is known at this point! I will add more information as and when it becomes available.

1. Switch Axe Overview

  The Switch Axe is a fairly new weapon first seen in Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii. The function of the weapon
  Axe mode provides the range and attack speed of a Greatsword, a far reaching Upward swing (ideal for cutting tails), and chain swings. 
  Sword mode brings out the incredible damage of the Switch Axe. Most importantly, even at low sharpness. Every Switch Axe also contain ""Phials"" which are released during Sword mode. Phials are extra elements or status inducing effects that are added on to the already existing element/effect of the weapon itself. Finally, Sword mode includes a ""Sword Burst"", an attack that charges the sword up, and causes an elemental/phial explosion towards the end of the sword. The drawbacks to Sword mode, are that the player's movement is severely reduced (akin to that of an unsheathed Greatsword) and that Sword mode attacks can only be used if your Sword Gauge is more than halfway full. 

To categorize the weapon

2. Basic Controls

1/Triangle = Vertical Swing
2/Circle = Horizontal Swing
1+2/Triangle+Circle = Both (duh.)

To save myself the trouble of constantly getting confused with PSP to 3DS button differences, 1+2 is both together. 

Axe Mode

Most attacks can be chained into each other

1 - Unsheathe/ Downward swing

1

F+1 - A forward stepping thrust with the end of the axe. Hit ""R"" after this attack to combo into Sword mode. 

2 - A short horizontal swing.

1+2 - A Massive upward swing

1+2, but does less damage, and greatly reduces stamina with each swing. You can end the chain swing at any time with a downward swing by pressing 1. 

R - If you have more than half the sword gauge full, gaining you 1/3 of your Sword Gauge back. (Note: the hunter can only ""reload"" the weapon when it is less than half way full).

Sword Mode 

R + 1+2 - Unsheathe automatically to Sword mode.

1

2

1+2 - Beginning of Sword Burst. Burst will cancel itself if 1 is not pressed repeatedly. 

1+2, the Burst will cause an explosion at the end of the sword. After Burst, the Switch Axe will always return to Axe mode, even if your Sword Gauge is above half-filled. From Charge to Burst takes about 2.5 seconds, but holding back on the analog stick while charging will cause the sword to burst earlier (0.5 - 1.5 seconds). This is to escape dangerous situations while charging Burst. Different phials affect the burst in different ways.


3. Why Switch Axe?

The Switch Axe is very versatile and can change with varying situations. Though Axe mode cannot get very many hits in trying to punish a monster, making it so that your teammates need not worry about getting tripped/launched through the air. The weapon is about having some levels of both damage and speed.  

 Plus

4. Elemental vs. Raw

Although Switch Axes are the 3rd strongest weapon in terms of numerical damage
 In the long run as well, with Water, Ice, and Dragon, needed only much later.

Just as an example:

Giganceladus 
Atk: 1196
Max Natural Sharpness: Blue
DPS: 44.86

The Crimsidian
Atk: 1012
Max Natural Sharpness: Purple
DPS: 52.41

 Higher element and sharpness win out over higher raw damage.
(Unless of course

Phials:

Phials are the extra add-on to Switch Axes that boost Sword mode. This section will list all of them along with usefulness. (Ranked in no particular order)

Power: Easily the best of the phial to have for your Switch Axe. Increases raw damage by 25% and Burst becomes pure raw damage.

Element: This phial boosts the element of your Switch Axe during Sword mode by 25% and makes Burst almost all elemental damage. Pretty useful.

Fatigue: This phial makes every hit of Sword mode do Stamina damage as well. Burst becomes a big stamina drain. This phial is pretty damn good.

Dragon: This phial is only available on Dragon-based Switch Axes. It makes Sword mode do even MORE Dragon Damage

Status: (Paralysis/Poison) These phials make Sword mode gain Status effects for whichever phial you have. Burst becomes a huge amount of the status. Meh. 


Best of the Best:

These are just my own personal recommendations for which Axes to go for. I'm going to separate them by Low Rank (Rarity 1 - 3), but it can be helpful with tough monster battles. 

*Sharpness goes in order from weakest to strongest: Red, Green Blue, White, Purple*

**ANSWER: There is actually weapon combo information from a Nico Nico 会議 that I have yet to read. Once I've read that I can assimilate it into this post

**INTRODUCTION: SUMMARIZED VERSION**

Hello

As mentioned I'll be translating MH4 info

Please refer to the [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1f0mxa/interest_check_mh4_translation_do_you_guys_want_it/) for more information on this project.

As usual I'll be including a sub-contents page in case people are confused. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.

- - -
**[8] Old Weapons
- - -
| [Greatsword
- - -

**Greatsword**

- **SWEEP SLASH**: Annoyed by silly little critters that bounce about? Never fear

- **JUMP SLASH**: That's right. You can now do the perfect YOLO attack by hitting a button mid-jump

- - -
**Longsword**

- **JUMPING SPIRIT BLADE**: A spirit blade combo only usable after jumping off from an elevated platform. Allows the hunter to perform some sort of continuous slash combo that uses up the spirit gauge

- - -
| [Sword
- - -

**Sword &amp; Shield**

- **UPPERCUT SLASH**: What it says on the tin. By leaping off a platform the hunter can jump high into the air and uppercut some fools. This apparently chains into its own combo...

- **RUSH SLASH**: Causes the hunter to rush forward and stab the target

- **CHARGE SLASH**: What you SNS guys have been waiting for forever - By charging up an attack you can now unleash a strong jump slash that can chain into other SNS combos.


- - -
**Dual Swords**

- **AERIAL DEMON'S DANCE**: Yep

- - -
| [Hammer
- - -

**Hammer**

- **JUMPING POUND**: Activated by jumping off a elevated ground while in charge mode. When the charge button is released in mid-jump

- - -
**Hunting Horn** 

- **CHAIN NOTES**: This allows for a single swing to produce **TWO** notes

- **JUMPING POUND**: Apparently more similar to a half-drunken dance off elevated ground

- - -
| [Lance
- - -

**Lance**

- **JUMP ATTACK**: An attack with extremely long reach

- **CHARGE JUMP**: An attack that is executed by performing the lance charge off elevated ground. The charge continues on

- **U-TURN BRANDISH**: An attack executed mid-charge

- - -
**Gunlance** 

- **JUMPING SMASH**: A jumping overhead smash performed by leaping off elevated ground. This attack can chain into a normal Full Burst/ Shotgun blast on impact.

- **JUMP SHOT**: A jumping gunlance shelling attack. This attack allows the hunter to chain into other aerial attacks

- - -
| [One for the Gunners - The Bowgun Club](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814168111/) |
- - -

**Light Bowgun**

- **JUMPING RELOAD**: Because there's a lot more to do than just looking at the scenery before you hit the ground. Through technological innovation

- - -
**Heavy Bowgun**

- **JUMPING RELOAD**: See above.

- **JUMP ATTACK**: Yes

- - -
| [Bow &amp; Switchaxe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96399088@N02/8814161631/) |
- - -

**Bow**

- **POWERSHOT**: A direct opposite of the normal arcing shots of the bow, this shot is only available to certain Bow models. Batteries sold separately. 

- - -
**Switch Axe**

- **AERIAL SWITCH**: Allows the hunter to switch from Axe to Sword mode (and supposedly vice-versa


- - - 

**Afterword**

I'll try to keep stuff updated on **ALL THREE** threads! Stay tuned and all that. 

If you would like to help, PM'd here, or added on the WiiU at Atelier.shirley.

   Well the fight starts and I'm doing well. I cut the tail, I think, I'll finish it off in this next area. This is when the Sensor decides to enact it's vengeance. As I'm transitioning area's the worst pops up,""Disc Read Error"". I was dumbstruck. I couldn't believe it. The plate was gone, I was going to have probably have to farm him for tens of hours to get another. I eject the disk and it is immaculate, not a speck of dirt or a scratch anywhere.
   I can only assume the Desire Sensor in all of it's technological prowess decided I must be punished for my earlier blasphemous thoughts by taking away what it saw fit to give me in the first place.

This seems to be a very frequently asked question on this board.  In the interest of perhaps cleaning up some of the question-asking submissions and outright incorrect replies that some of the aforementioned submissions garner

To reiterate:

Q: Is it better to capture or kill a monster to get &lt;INSERT RARE DROP HERE&gt;?

**A: IT DEPENDS.**

There is no universal rule that unequivocally states that always killing the monster or always capturing the monster is the best way to get the drop you're looking for.  Regarding this question, ""always kill!  Killing gets you more carves than capturing the monster!""... well, this is a factually true statement.  (Usually, you get three carves from a monster corpse, and usually, you get two capture rewards for taking it alive.)  *But!* it doesn't mean that it's the best way to get the specific item that **you** are looking for.  It ultimately depends on what item the Desire Sensor/Random Number God is trying to keep you from getting.

Monsters have separate loot tables for capturing them and killing them.  They also have separate tables that determine which reward you'll get for breaking a part

*Separately*, fighting a specific monster in a specific quest is the best way to maximize your chances of getting your item.

Now

Q: What's the best way to get &lt;INSERT RARE ITEM HERE&gt;?

A: Look it up.  (**EDIT:**  I am assuming Monster Hunter 3U/3G for this question

The sheer amount of content in this game had really piqued my interest. I’m a passionate fan of RPGs and their mechanics. Also, I fell in love with RPGs due to their stories. The game mechanics were something I learned to love, story was always my primary motivator. MH doesn’t have a story. Then I started hearing comparisons to Dark Souls. Now, I’ve never played Dark Souls, but I know my gaming tastes well enough to know I don’t enjoy bashing my face into a brick wall endlessly. I don’t want to play a game that is ridiculously hard for the sake of being ridiculously hard. Finally, although the amount of content in this game is unrivaled. Just trying to understand the game quickly became daunting, let alone playing it. 

Regardless, had completed a variety of Level 1 gathering quests, was well stocked on potions, and was ready for my first big monster hunt! It was like my first day of school! I was excited, albeit a little nervous. But, my backpack was ready, I set out my clothes the day before, check, and throw me in the trash can.

Off I went! A Qurupeco was in my sights! This giant bird like creature would be the first of many a monster I would slay. I would quickly take this one down and be on to the next. Heck, and then revel in glory!

After a quick exploration I spot my target. I slash around a bit. Whee! This is fun! I’m hunting monsters! The bird runs away. I run after it. Slash some more. Sharpen my blades. Bird runs again. I find it again. Start slashing

Hmm. Maybe it’s just my weapon? I *did* have to sharpen it a lot. Maybe I just need a weapon that stays sharp longer? I get myself a long sword. Gather a bit. Upgrade it a couple times. And now I’m ready to go! Find the bird. Stab, slash, slash, slash. Now the bird is drooling! YES!!! I *must* be close to taking him down!? I can taste victory already! I’m definitely noticing some patterns and getting better a dodging and avoiding attacks. And now there is the dragon. And now I’m dead. Dragon. Dead. Dragon. Dead.

Okay. This is a little tougher than I originally thought. If only I could keep track of that bird and avoid the dragon. Time to take break, but I’m not sure what to do with them. A couple wiki searches later I find out the dung bombs will drive the dragon away and paintballs will help me track the Qurupeco! Perfect! That’s exactly what I need! 

Third attempt. Find bird. Track with paintball. Slash, jab. Dragon. Throw dung bomb. Dragon flees. Find bird (more quickly this time). Slash, slash. Dodge, dodge. Jab. Dodge. Now the bird is drooling and panting. FINALLY! This is it! Get my monster hunter badge of awesomeness ready. The problem is all of this dodging and slashing seems to be running down my stamina. I’m out of breath pretty quickly and this bird seems pretty pissed. It’s more violent and aggressive than it was before. I can’t seem to keep up… and I’m dead. And dead. And dead.

Fourth attempt. This time I’ve stocked up on meat

What a rush! This wasn’t like any regular videogame win I have had before. I didn’t win because I had the biggest and baddest weapon. I didn’t win because I had the most hit points or strongest armor. I won because I [read: me, how to defend better, when to attack better. And with that revelation, I, regardless of the many attempts to understand Monster Hunter, finally actually understood Monster Hunter. I’m pretty excited to hunt my next monster. I’m even excited to be destroyed by that monster.

The next five minutes involved me frantically trying to get him to run to the Jaggia den so I could still have the chance of killing him and not fail the quest (which is when he pounced me). He finally does, stabbing and flinching and dodging like a boss.  

Fifteen seconds left, only this time I'm too far back. I watch his malice spread across the screen and hit-- A JAGGIA. THE LAST. JAGGIA. I took the hit, but was granted immortality a frame before in order to wreak my vengeance upon Jho for his insolence.  

Thirty seconds into the remaining minute, and *extremely* satisfied, I saunter toward his corpse for some last minute carving aaaaaand... Exit to the next zone.

We're so close to the release of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate! I can hardly contain my excitement

First, but that plan has changed. What we really want to do is provide the community with as much information as possible, and we believe this will best be achieved by creating a ""companion"" to the Japanese guide, one that is entirely in english but contains none of the copyrighted images or graphs in the original. All the information will be preserved, but in a format we can distribute without repercussions. Translation will begin very shortly, and we'll hopefully have another update soon with progress.

Second, organize hunts, trade items, and ask for help. I enlisted the help and guidance of two of our own, wipqozn and icbat, and have been discussing ideas with them. The plan has evolved into a less complicated solution. Club Teamwork has [a ""Hunting Parties"" system](http://teamworkcast.com/parties/) that is very well done, and has its own community of users. I believe that if the subscribers from our subreddit began using it for organizing hunts, and top of the main page, so users who meet up in general chat for the purpose of slaying a monster can all navigate to their own chat room and use that for communication. I believe we may hold off on this to at least see how the game itself turns out

I believe that's all for now. If anyone has any questions,False,self,t5_2rron,False,,SAU,t3_1a0bbh

Hello friends!

As we've recently learned from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/197xcg/brady_guide_digital_and_only_250_pages/)

but would it be possible to get a group of friends together, amounting to hundreds of people. it would be quite the undertaking, and would take some time. but wouldn't it be worth it?

let me know your thoughts!

edit: After a little research, then this would make the translation process simpler than trying to learn japanese, or trying to manually input the characters into a translator based off what is on the page.

edit2: I've done a proof of concept. Using [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xftpcYcauqg), [this is the weapon, name and picture are perfect](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Marine_Fisher). 

edit3: I've created a Google Group to manage this undertaking. I HAVE PURCHASED* the guide and will scan it myself, sign in with your Google account, and apply for membership. I believe this is best done through the use of something more official like a Google Group as opposed to a less secure and more open platform. It will take quite some time for this guide to arrive, so signing up now will mean you wait just a bit for any translating. But when the guide arrives, I'll let this group know, and post a follow-up post on the subreddit, followed by weekly updates.

	With the release of MH3U I thought it would be a good idea to start a “weekly stupid question thread”. I figured this could be a good way for new hunters to ask questions about the game without flooding the subreddit with new threads and also without fear of being struck down by some of the more ‘passionate’ hunters (although I’ve been very impressed by the amount of civility on this board so far). 


If this receives positive feedback I’ll continue to post these threads weekly. If this isn’t wanted I’ll recede back into my cave and continue to hunt

I haven’t played a MH title since MHFU so I am still quite a bit rusty on my combinations/skills. With that said, but is this combo still in the game? If so, is the combo the same? I also remember bringing an ancient potion and lifepowder on every quest – do these still exist? If they do, what are the recipes? ( fyi: Lifepowder would heal everyone in the zone. Ancient Potions maxed stamina and health. Max potions restored all your health and also set it to maximum.)

I did some basic calculations and here's the answer: you're better off with the Critical Eye +3 skill than Attack Up (L) when the base damage for your weapon is **greater than**:

* 1282 for Great Sword
* 881 for Long Sword
* 374 for Dual Swords / Sword and Shield 
* 1388 for Hammer
* 1228 for Hunting Horn / Switch Axe
* 614 for Lance / Gunlance
* 347 for Light Bowgun
* 395 for Heavy Bowgun (454 for limiter removed)
* 320 for Bow.

* Early weapon paths will likely involve Icecrystals to upgrade to the next part. If you are on the early village quests without access to the tundra, and you can go to zone 6 which has the chance for Ice crystals.

* If you find yourself going on gathering quests for the tundra or volcano frequently

* If you want a rare trade from the argosy captain

* If you are in need of village resource points, you can start the game with 5000 points right off the bat and it takes only a minutes work.

* If you are still in need of resources, and fight him until you knock him over. Walk over to his legs and press ""A"". You will proceed to mine from the brute, which has a 50% chance to result in a Lava Nugget. These bad boys can be turned in to Junior for **1500** resource points. The best part is, you can mine the Urugaan **every time you knock him down**, resulting in insane resource points in a very short amount of time.

* If you do not have access to Urugaan yet, which can be turned in for 1000 points, not too shabby early on.

1. Should I hold on to every random item I get or should I be selling stuff for cash? I get all of these weird random items during quests and I don't know what to do with them. I mean things like bones, and other weird stuff. If this was an Elder Scrolls game I'd be selling all of this crap for cash. Should I hold on to this stuff obsessively in case I need it later or should I sell it?

2. What's this whole Resources / Commodities thing? Are Resources and Commodities items? Like

3. Should I be stressing about upgrading / forging weapons and armor early in the game (&lt; 10 hours) or should I just chill out and go on simple quests and free hunting? I can't tell how aggressive I am supposed to be about this.

4. Should I use the shops in town, and forge stuff? I can't quite tell what the game wants me to do here. It almost seems like I should ignore the shops.

So obviously it's still monster hunter, I more wanted to just express a few minor concerns and hear other peoples' thoughts on them. (Also note I've only played Tri before, so when I mention weapons or monsters being new, I mean not in Tri).

 - No instruction/guide: Not much of an issue for me

 - Text hard to read?: Maybe it was just me, so maybe the text sizes and fonts were just optimized for the display on the 3DSXL and shrinking them down to fit the smaller screens messes it up. Anyone else have this issue?

 - Special attack button difficult to hit or not responsive: I just had trouble with the touch screen special attack button. I'm not sure if there will be an option to move it when were allowed to customize the lower screen layout or not, I hope so.

 - I really miss having Zl and Zr for swimming: I now understand why people complained about underwater hunting. Having the shoulder buttons for simple swim up and swim down was lovely

 - **I love the target camera!:** obviously there's no complaint or gripe here

 - Hooray for free passage from area **5** back to **3** in the tundra!: That's gonna be a big time saver when it comes time to hunt Gigginox (also

1368710085.0,1eg5kt,PSA: Try not to set a trap when a monster is in rage mode,Corfal,46,14,75,"I see this about once every 2 or 3 lobbies

For those who don't know, it increases the time they're in the trap.

Along with that

People placing a trap 2 minutes in when the monster first rages is really irksome. If it's a monster that's constantly in rage mode (looking at you Diablos) then majority of the time it's because your teams DPS is more than enough to kill the monster and I don't have much gripe over that. But when I see you place a trap at seemingly random times and only when the monster is in rage mode

Pitfall traps also are more effective against a fatigued monster than a shock trap. They last 2x longer (don't quote me on that exact figure) and if they're asleep/paralyzed/KO'd while in the trap the trap timer is paused until they start thrashing about again. So if you see someone place a pitfall trap and notice the monster is fatigued


If anyone would like to add or correct anything said here

Added Information: Nargacuga can **only be trapped by a pitfall trap while in rage mode**.

1. Capture Guru is your best friend. Get it through the bone armor set, but im not sure on that one.

2. Wait for the monster to limp. This is a good way to gauge his health. when the monster is at 25% health or so

3. Never ever lay a trap in the first zone you see him limp in. this is a sure fire way to waste a trap. Once a monster starts limping, but if you need this info, then its safer to just wait. I always try to lay traps when said monster gets into a new zone.

4. Give him some time! Do not wail on him and wail and wail and kill him on accident. chances are good your not strong enough to kill him accidently

5. don't wait for him to be in the trap to tranq him. If you know hes ready, toss a few tranqs at him before he gets into the trap. This doesn't mean hit him with tranqs right when you show up at the start of the quest. This means tranq him a minute or two before he falls into said trap and thats probbaly streaching it just a bit.
          
6. Traps are finiky, or the amount of times a monster has been in said trap in the fight. I try to save one type of trap for caping, and not use it more than once unless I have to. This may not be an option for you, but it normally will be. 

7. If you follow these guidelines and get a monster limping, beat him into submission. this actually does work. you can push him over the edge by attacking him and possibly getting him to the point of capture if you just off by a hair. this obviously works better in multiplayer. try to coordinate with your friends, one is tranqing the others are attacking.

If for whatever reason you can't access your TV or you just want to be polite and not interrupt whoever is using the TV these instructions are for you.

**Offline Gamepad configuration**

1) Select your character in the main menu using type 1 (default

2) Register a panel set that has no UI on the gamepad (this can be done before hand). Select the panel settings with no UI.

3) Exit those panel settings so you see moga village map with “B”

4) Press select, A, left, down, down, A, right

You have now configured your gamepad to type 2 and you can change your panels.

Note: You cannot change your panel settings if you set your game to type 2 in the main menu because the gamepad will no longer function as a touch screen so you cannot configure your panels. Although yes you could change your panel settings and save before stopping each MH session to configure without a TV.

A Song of Wyvern Fire and Ice 

it is a new day. i am awakened to the sound of carts carrying fallen comrades back to town. they have all fainted during a routine farming operation in the moga woods. i am still recovering from my battle with lagi but i figure a little moga cola with mossy cheese will help start my day. 


i was planning on sitting napping but the village is in a state of unrest. i elect to head over to the tavern


after petting my piggy (a compulsion i know


walking around the village i wave to the ""Gal with the Goods"" who then proceeds to giggle


sigh


after walking home to change


the tavern is packed tonight. there are lots of people i know as well as some new faces. Neokrilik is boasting about his love for his new Switch axe. i pass by Sgtsheabo and give a head nod. he is still wearing equipment from decades ago. well earned gear


while there are people in good spirits, a new invention compared to the old days. Uncle Scrotes joins in, saying that he has been busy getting materials for his bow collection. even since he nailed a Plessy between the eyes, he has forsaken all other weaponry. 


there is a sudden commotion in the tavern


the rathian has to be dealt with. i pay my tab and head off to the woods

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



I start off my hunt as always


i pass by a roaming band of Apanoth considering if i should partake in a snack. i could always go for a well done steak


i enter the area after hearing Ian roar. 


my hammer is getting heavy but i know my duty. i must slay this beast. 


i begin my assault. cha cha break off from the hunt.... to slay a vprey. i know not to question the ways of cha cha. he is wise


i ready my hammer


i deliver many successfuly blows to face of the beast knocking it out. 


slam, having an angled front helps guide the force of this mallet of destruction.


the Ian awakens


i charge up another slam and deliver a blow to its legs. pound


the ian however


i have been poisoned. my reckless abandon and confidence has cost me. chacha guides me back to my feet. cha cha begins to dance and i feel my health returning but i am still ill. 


the ian lands, knowing that if i am going down, i will at least soften up this monster for another hunter to take my place. 


with its face broken and legs mashed, i steady myself, hammer in hand and head to the monsters nest knowing that the more time i take, the more it will heal itself. i am growing frustrated. my hands ca barely lift my hammer now, as i grip my 3ds.. i mean, my weapon i roam the jungle. 


jumping past 2 bahabra who try to sting me


i arrive at the nest


the ian appears to have just settled in. the carcass of a vprey has barely started to stink. (more so than normal). 


this is my chance


i am pounced on by some of the vpreys bretheren who has slipped into the nest. my armor has taken most of the damage but the commotion of me getting hit (and the rude bastard who shoved me on the train) has caused a critical error. i turn my hammer and relinquish the minion of its life.


but the ian is awake and angry. 


i being to run around and swipe at the monsters feet tripping it. the ian will likely take to the skies... 


so i smash its wings


the ian trys one last charge. i have grown weary of this battle. 


i charge my hammer

anddddd.... swing too early. i was moving as i charged my hammer and the momentum and early release has caused me to spin wildly... i am done for. 


the ian runs head long into one of my spins... cracking it upside its head draining the life from its eyes. i barely notice as i am still locked in a merri-go-round spin attack. 


Quest Completed.


i continue to spin until i let go of my hammer nearly creaming chacha who has begun to raid the nest for eggs. 


i sit down and rest. the threat is gone. 


but then the real challenge has began... lugging this carcass back to the town for proof... and carry my huge hammer back to base. 


a hunters work is never gone.

-Slay on my brothers.

We get together hunt for a few quests and then post about our experience afterwards.  So here's the Basics of what's going down

**What do I need?**
Since Reddit is an online community the best way we can meet up is an online version.  Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the Wii-U is the game we're going to be playing.  No need for anything extra than your system and your time!

**When?**

We'll be holding the hunts on Sundays at an arranged time.  Us hunters come from many time zones so the schedule will be set once all 4 hunters are decided between those hunters.

**Who get's to go?**  

Every Wednesday there will be a ""recruitment"" post that determines who will hunt.  We'll have a variety of people to hunt with.  This recruitment thread will have invited guests from time to time  but the majority of hunters will be determined by top voted comments on the recruitment thread.  Each week will have it's own question or statement.  

**Where?**

Well the /r/MonsterHunter Reddit rooms of course!  Free Play 2, the password or our regular lobby it's on the sidebar.

**After Hunt Post**
After the meetup is finished we'll have a discussion thread to talk about what happened afterwards.  We don't have to have screen captures, talk about how we goofed up, or w/e conversations come from meeting up.

**Who's running this Shin-Dig?**
Fortuan

**early start**
since we missed Wednesday this week I'll just post today's question.  This first time will have me just as a meetup to see a few of you guys and the top 3 posts to this question  ""Who's In!?""

I picked up Freedom Unite for the PSP

Anyway

I'm working on the Village quests right now

Anyway, so I guess I'm feeling a little overconfident. I take the quest to kill the Yian Kut-Ku. I take 10 mega potions with me, and next to nothing else.  

Big mistake.

I grab the supply stuff, a shock trap, 3 tranq bombs, 2 sonic bombs, and 2 rations.

Clearly that was not enough.

I engage YKK, my stamina bar is dropping, and worst of all, my weapons are completely dull. What do I do? 

I decide to break combat with him and hope on a wing and a prayer that I can find something in the wild that can help me out.

Avoiding combat as best I can

I scour the jungle walls looking for places to mine, nor out of any other mining node in the entire jungle. 

I start rooting around in the ground for mushrooms and herbs, and two Honey. I mix up two mega potions, then hunt down those herbivores I saw earlier in the cave. I kill them and get some raw meat, cook it up, and bam, two well-done steaks. So I'm back at full health, full energy

Let's do this.

I find YKK in an area with a bunch of Velociprey. He engages me, and then the final battle starts. I drop my shock trap once I notice him limping again, and he gets snared in it. I toss my tranq bombs but it was a no go- I have to go into direct combat with him. My weapon's got two levels of sharpness left. He's limping around. I've got one health potion left- No, make that none, he got a lucky tail whip off. 

He charges at me, directly to his head. 

Mission cleared.

Yian Kut Ku falls

I love this game so much.

A lot of people were complaining about the cameras and the controls. They seemed strange at first, I was able to get them down with a little bit of practice. I began with a greatsword, and I think it's grown on me cause I love it. I tried lance and switch axe, but I still go back to the sword. Soon I felt relatively comfortable fighting the snow bunny thing, so I went to fight the pelican sloth in water fun world, which was just as awesome.

So that is a quick rundown of my short experience. Overall, it forces you to put a lot of focus into movement, timing, and attacking, since all of those things combined are pretty difficult to a new player.

The graphics are no crysis

So far the enemies and bosses have not been disappointing. They aren't quite like anything I've fought before, I spent like 30 minutes fighting the pelican sloth. Can't wait to fight some of the (hopefully bigger) guys.

My one issue is that the game, the invisible walls could use some work. I mean, I can understand for some things, but teasing me with a huge expanse of ocean and then blocking the thing off with a flat invisible wall? Don't do that to me man!

Thanks Reddit Hunters for helping me and all other new players learn the ropes.,WooperScooper,26,2,3,"Some 50 hours in to MH3U my first real effort to experience a Monster Hunter game. When I play any game like this I tend to first find as many websites and resources as I can to try to pick apart the game and learn as much information as I can. 

Along with the Monster Hunter Wiki and the (I believe created by a Redditor from this board) amazing Mhpedia.com

I'm still a new hunter but I'd love to hunt with anyone to learn the game better. Add me on Nintendo Network with the ID ""WooperScooper"" if you care to!
