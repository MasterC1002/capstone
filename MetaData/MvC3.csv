We had vanilla, and even Dark Phoenix just because Capcom didn't think we had it hard enough. We had glitches out of our ass, a cast that only the top 10 really mattered, and a metagame completely centralized around rushdown and nothing more.

For all intents and purposes, but we pushed through and had fun.

Now Capcom is giving us a brand new game (I really consider it brand new. Characters, balance, all new stuff. Sue me I think New Vegas is Fallout 4) and it's fixing its mistakes. Just going off of what was wrong with Vanilla: 

DHC glitch gone. No more can a simple DHC one shot the entire cast. While we're on that topic

Invincible assists are gone. No more relying on the ""push a button get a combo"" door prize. If you want an invincible assist to abuse, and Phoenix Wright well have fun you earned it.

Dark Phoenix? With the nerfs to her air options, and side-exchanges, we have a much more balanced character. Still great, but you have to earn it and play smart.

With the recent buffs and new characters

Rushdown? Meet solid keepaway. With Ghost rider being slept on, Ammaterasu's cold star, Deadpools guns, I believe dooms projectiles, and many more) with more priority, keepaway is seeming more and more viable as a lockdown/chip strategy.

Overall they have really overhauled this game when you look at it, so and so character is broken now."" 

What I want you to do is look at Vanilla and tell me you didn't think Sentinel was broken in the first few weeks up until his health nerf. Months later

Wesker right now is the next big thing, like we did around assists and x-factor. He lost a LOT of his mixups and resets as well as his longer combos and gun confirms. He lost a lot more than people give him credit for and all he has gotten is the sunglasses.

Yes they are strong, he's now indisputably best on anchor. What's the solution? Snap in the problem. This was always the case with Phoenix and if you have to use xfc level 1 to kill him, but take away your opponents only end-game factor, then it was completely worth it. More so, players need to stop with the mentality of ""I have to hit him"" when he's in xfc. 

Just focus on blocking. Alone, you have time to see which. If he's above, block high, if he's below it's more than likely you block low. People who can fly, people who can teleport or float, people with projectiles, they all lame out his xfactor and once he's done

With the addition of keepaway and much better runaway

I guess to sum up this long winded rant: The game isn't even a month old, and if there are still major problems months from now we'll know and so will Capcom. Just relax and play the damn game.",,False,self,t5_2s01r,False,frankWest,

I've played somewhere around 7500 matches of Marvel so far, but mostly Zero and Dante. I've read the Bradygames Guide front to back. (Best book I've ever read.) Current ranking on XBL is somewhere around 40th in the world. So I know a thing or two about Marvel.

So here

Things you should ask about: Team building, execution tips, what character should I play, tiers, what I think about the game, dealing with frustration (Marvel is pretty much designed to get players flustered.) and whatever else you can think of.

And here's my youtube channel. You've probably seen a few of these videos on the frontpage of SRK and the like. http://www.youtube.com/user/EviltoasterofFP?feature=mhee

So here's a list of all **viable** TAC infinites. Pick one up for whichever character you have and spend your training mode time this week learning it. If you do not have a TAC infinite capable character under your belt

---

[Magneto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm3y2tranlU). Easy as balls.

[Iron-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4AtK5un7A). Takes a while to learn the setup

[Doctor Doom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgOaEpNs8s). Takes practice

[Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVnB2A1FiWI). Complicated setups on higher altitudes

[Amaterasu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGUTGiy6orQ) ([+midscreen varants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euS6jdWMGAw)) I'm actually not sure how easy this is

[Morrigan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVI_FmhQOYQ). Not hard at all once you understand how to input it. No major timing required after the setup.

[Trish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQjp2i8HHq8). Difficult

[Storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJRuJ1vlqdI). Not hard. Be sure to use qcb.S+H to get the unfly-&gt;H correctly. (pretty sure that's required

[Dormammu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRGY0_CWPWc). Requires a lot of timing and attention

[Chun-Li](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0vnD47ZH1A) ([Non-glitch version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWisBDnfnPg)). Probably hard

[Sentinel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9CBXFs7rg). Setup can be tricky

[MODOK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejylq8bJCYQ) ([+midscreen down TAC variant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d045RxeGQC4)). Probably difficult

[Spencer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH9S1KBLEc0). Heavy on the timing but Drecker swears he can do it. It works in all directions though

So this week

---

**WHAT IS PLINK DASHING?**

Plink dashing is abusing the game's two-button-dash input leniency to dash at ridiculous speeds. The game lets you dash even if you input a button late. So pressing L and M one frame apart will get you a dash even if you were already dashing. Because you can cancel dashes into attacks

The best way to physically execute this (assuming you play on an arcade stick, then just slam both fingers downward. Your first finger hits first, second finger hits a frame late. Bam, plink dash. On pad, you'll have to get creative with button layout. I hear using a trigger button for this helps.

---

**METHODS**

[](//#ATK)~[](//#ATK)**Two button plinking.** The least lenient method of plink dashing, M~H, H~L, M~L, H~M, you get it. It must be inputted one frame apart.

[](//#L)~[](//#M)[](//#H) **Three button plinking.** While this may be slightly harder to input correctly, you will often hear your character speak as if they were performing an attack before dashing. This is because the input leniency is longer than one frame, opposed to how it is in two button plinking. It feels like 2 or 3 frames, but the extra boost is enough to make it very easy.

[](//#L)~[](//#M)~[](//#H) **Piano Method.** I've never figured out this myself

[](//#H)~([](//#L)[](//#M)[](//#H)) **Schmidt Select.** Probably the most brain dead method of them all, which is very effective in the air. 

[](//#H)~[](//#L)[](//#M) **FChamp style.** Effectively the same as the Schmidt Select

[](//#ATK)~[](//#ATK)[](//#H) **Doom/Thor flight mode variant.** Doom and Thor have lingering H attacks, use L or M to start.

[](//#S)~[](//#ATK)[](//#ATK) **S-Plinking.** Some find this easier due to the button positions

Note: For this article I'm only talking about point Wesker

* **Run Strider** Vajra is by far Weskers best assist, and Wesker can easily OTG and convert if it hits an airborne opponent. It also comes with the benefit of anchor Strider which is never a bad thing to have.

* **Abuse your launcher** Seriously

* **Optimize your combo** The time of l.m.h.s.m.m.h.s. otg super is over. Wesker has the ability to get 900 to 1 mil per combo but it's technical and you have to actually practice it. Players like Roach King and Alucard are already stepping up to this.

* **Use the projectile counter** It's a good move


That's all I have for things people need to be doing more of, is the optimal Wesker team.


***

And that would be team assist me, Strider but with a twist, I want Doom with Rocks assist. Everyone already knows how Wesker and Strider play and they know how they work together so I'm going to focus on why I think Doom is the best second character (as opposed to say Vergil) and the over all team strategy. 

One of Weskers biggest faults IMO is the glasses mechanic, removing the risk involved with the TAC. After that it's just a matter of mixing up the other character and repeating and with Wesker and Strider that shouldn't be to hard. 

Now for why I chose to go with Rocks assist. I wanted Dooms assist to bring something new to the table and Strider tracks better than missiles and provides a better teleport cross-up than beam. Rocks does provide a ton of support for the team though

So that's my look at Wesker, at least as far as assists go.",,False,self,t5_2s01r,1367282127.0,zero,

* Favorite US players= Yipes and Fchamp since they are really good and fun to watch  
* On the Japanese marvel scene= the marvel scene became bigger after EVO this year, it's not just japan isn't playing the game it's also because the US have been playing mvc1/2 longer    
* Favorite anime/manga = K-On! Favorite character is Mugi  
* He plays Vergil/Doom because they work well with spiderman and he built the team around SM since that's his favorite character  
* His twitter https://twitter.com/kanamamespider  
* He thinks the game hasn't developed to the point where 1 team beats all other teams  
* He thinks the US is underrating x23
* He doesn't have a Top 5 characters list since a lot of the characters can be used in different positions  
* Top 5 Japanese players= Chou, Reichan (?) and one more (sorry forgot)  
* No interest in AE
* On his match against RickyO (where he was eliminated) = can't say much
* Opinion on Morri-Doom combination= the only thing he has to say is that it's a strong combination  
* On losing his ft3 moneymatch with OMGitzAndre= andre is funny and a good player  
* He says that ALL the big japanese mvc3 players are going to Finalround and EVO next year.  
* Kusoru won't come to the US for anymore tourneys because he has no money to travel and he's busy with school and other things. He would go if he was invited though  
EDIT: stuff that I just remembered  
* On JWong's Spider-man play (aka mamejustin)= his spider-man was solid and had good fundamentals but jwong wasn't maximizing his damage  
* Did he feel disrespected by the US team not playing their main characters= not really

1376555462.0,1keplg,On opening people up with Dante,Evil_Toaster,51,11,15,"[](/twibook)I want to clear some air about Dante because he's both a good and bad character but is ultimately a ""required"" character because he has Jam Session

There's two ways to open people up with Dante, which you'll have to do inbetween assist calls and when you're alone, is to frustrate your opponent into pressing a button.

Dante, has no unreactable mixups outside of landing a throw, which does no damage. The only way your opponent will get hit is if they press a button. Be it they try to attack you when you're out of their range (but in yours,) catching them trying to forward or backdash, baited their advancing guard, or tricked them into teching a throw that doesn't even exist.
So lets go over both methods of offense.

---

**Teleport mixups with assists**

Teleport + Assist is Dante's standard assist mixup. Because Dante will always appear in the same spot however

**The math on Stinger-&gt;Teleport**

Stinger inflicts 27 frames of blockstun, which isn't exactly as advantageous as you would think. Dante's j.M is 10 frame startup, with j.H being 13. Whichever you choose, if you fall immediately with one of these moves, your opponent will still have at least 5 frames to act.

Depending on character height, leaving you completely open to an air throw. j.H is the better option if you do this, because you will hit crouching characters (which is the point of overhead attacks in the first place.) It is best you hold a direction when you do this so you will option select an air throw into the falling H just in case the opponent escapes (e.g. you hit them airborne and they escape the blockstun.)

Now the problem in doing this *without* an assist is that even though you are at frame advantage, and 1 for the startup. So even being at +7 doesn't leave you completely safe for an immediate j.H. 

**If they pushblock**

Problems occur when opponents start to learn to use advancing guard against Stinger. Pushblocking the Stinger as quickly as possible will *lessen* the blockstun received

The timing of the opponents pushblock controls where Dante will appear after the teleport. If your opponent is aware of this, and push you back in front of their character, thus avoiding any left/right mixup and putting you back where you started. 

**Where assists come in**

While it is generally thought that the reason to use assists with teleport is to left/right mixup with the assist itself (which is a perfectly valid mixup, the opponent can control the outcome of the teleport by pushblocking in the right ways.

If you want to get the assist hit to cross up from a stinger-&gt;BC-&gt;teleport

Ideally, there's an extra period of time where your assist will continue moving when you and your opponent will not, this is approximately 4-6 frames on Stinger.

This means if you call an assist at the same time your perform a stinger teleport

**How this will give you a proper mixup**

Used correctly, you could get a free hit anyway.

Now here's the big reason why the assist call is key. If the opponent pushblocks your Stinger immediately, and you can not be pushed away.

Depending on what assists you use

*Now* your opponent is in a setup where they must block a mixup. You're above their head, now you have an actual mixup to do.

**The mixup**

Now you have a simple left right mixup to play with here. One thing you will need to take into account is your assist is probably going to push your opponent back just enough to where if you land straight down, you can use an airdash to better position yourself to whichever side of the opponent you want to hit, depending on how your assist hits them.

Using The Hammer is another option, you can get an ambiguous mixup, simply by falling with a j.H or falling with a hammer. Falling with a j.H will get you to the ground quicker, but using The Hammer will keep you in the air, and for some assists, will push your opponent under you, and the hammer will cross up. It's very difficult to react to.

Should either of this options fail and they block your mixup, or even throw if you want to give your assist the time to recharge.

I always like using an OTG assist with Nemesis. Yeah it's really situational

Because you always use drones. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows you only ever use drones.

Well fuck what everyone knows. Today I switched things up. Launcher slam, not to mention that rocket punch does something like 60k more damage than katanarama, has better range, and can be used to effectively slow down incoming rushes. I destroyed my playgroup today. It was beautiful and it was terrible.

So I guess all I'm saying is fuck not doing something in this game just because the general attitude is that you're making a bad call. Try stuff out. See what works. MvC2 made it ten years because people tried unconventional things and learned that their initial impressions of top-tier characters and how to play the game were dead wrong.

Go try something you like because you think it's fun and see if it's awesome. You might be surprised.

It's time I stopped doing tournament interest checks and just did it, this is not a one-day tournament**. 

POST WHEN WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU

SIGNUPS WILL TAKE PLACE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK

Easy explanation of Waseda Style, it's done. If A1 and B2 win, they play each other. A and B positions are locked to prevent countering (Register your team as A: Player1 / B: Player2)

**SETS WILL BE 2/3 PER PLAYER, winners 2/3 if necessary). If you disagree with this, feel free to discuss it.

**DOUBLE ELIMINATION** (Winners and losers brackets)
 
Basic rules so far

* Standard tournament rules as far as time/damage/glitches etc goes. (Pretty straightforward
* Nobody with a skull icon (High disconnect rate mark of shame) may enter (Either you're a toxic player or your net is too unreliable for online tournament play).
* TEAMS ARE LOCKED
* NO 2v2 TEAM MAY HAVE MORE THAN ONE OF THE SAME CHARACTER TWICE! (This is more for the sake of variety. If your team is Dante/Vergil/Magneto
* You will have 48 hours to play your matches before being DQ'd into losers / eliminated (For the sake of time
* One player from **each** team must verify results -ALTERNATIVE- one player from either team may submit a replay of the set (In the interest of fairness; if you are caught cheating I **will** ban you from /r/mvc3)
* Prize will be some amount of MSP to each player or some virtual good(s) of equal value
* This will probably be restricted to NA/USA only, yadda yadda yadda. Not sure about Canadian connections, need input from some Canucks)
* If a match drops and one player is kicked out of the lobby, sadly, so this will be on the honor system (If a trend is seen, your team will be DQ'd)
* Lag issues will need to be discussed in this post.

**For some reason I can't get Input macros to work

For the first of our weekly character discussions, movement options, zoning options, assists, etc. Let's share the info on how to make him effective in a match. How are YOU playing Hawkeye?

In fact

**Hawkeye Basic Information**

* 900
* Primary focus - Long-range zoning &amp; Punishment.
* Best Super - Gimlet (QCF+AtkAtk).
* Optimal screen position: Mid to full screen
* Optimal position on teams: Second or Anchor


**Assists**

* Quick Shot (Greyhound) - Standard beam arrow assist a-la Taskmaster. Useful for setting up tricky crossups and controlling horizontal space. Low end of the projectile durability scale.

* Violent Fizz (Poison) - Light version of Trick Maneuver canceled into Violent Fizz

* Ragtime (Kamikaze) - Controls a ton of vertical space. Works as a miniature faster version of Hidden Missiles

**Misc. Knowledge**

* Has possibly the best slide in the game

* You can have more than one Exploding Arrow on the screen at once.

* If you land a Gimlet anywhere on the bottom half of the screen and X-Factor you can follow it up with a full combo immediately.

* X-Factoring Gimlet before the arrow hits the opponent after the move comes out causes it to get the damage bonus (Odd timing).

* Shock Value [Towards+M] is incredibly fast

* Constantly canceling his normals into Trick Maneuver L and using Poison Tip places you at great block advantage and sets up some strong pressure situations.

* Don't forget that his standing H can be aimed up to 45 degrees up or down

* **Gimlet is an omni-directional nearly instant 250k hit that can punish literally anything. Abuse the hell out of it.**

**Basic Hawkeye BnB's**

* c.LM xx Slide xx S, Trick Maneuver L xx Ice Arrow, Slide xx S, neutral SJ j.MMHS, Trick Maneuver L into Poison Tip xx Gimlet (Corner combo, Midscreen requires  H Trick Maneuver on the first OTG OR Towards+M [Shock Value]) - ~488,400 plus Poison.

* s.H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; QCF+M &gt; s. H &gt; qcb M &gt; L &gt; Gimlet - Hunter Loop (s.H is the uncharged arrow). Unsure on damage as I just turned my console off.

This could range as far as one can imagine; execution tips, the list goes on. **Do not berate people for what asking you think is a stupid question.

The primary purpose of these threads if for more seasoned Marvel / Fighter veterans to share our knowledge with newer players.

Just got these 4 titles myself today so I'll give some confirmations and explain how I got them.

I got these offline in Arcade mode Very Easy-Highest Damage. You may be able to get them online as well but I havent tried that.

I havent been able to unlock the space one but I did play in both Asgards and Galactus stage using Captain America's 4th

I used the wiki to reference the costumes to make things a little easier: http://marvelvscapcom.wikia.com/wiki/Alternate_Costumes

Once you have met the requirements by winning on that stage you can exit AFTER the next match starts...(I did it that way to make sure)


**Title: But That's Not Me!**
 **Unlock Condition**: Win a match using three costumes inspired by a different character than the one selected.
**Stage:** SHADOWLAND
**Team Used:** Hulk's 4th


**Title:** Days of Future Past
**Unlock Condition:** Win a Days of Future Past match using 3 character costumes inspired by Age of Apocalypse or Age of X.
**Stage:** DAYS OF FUTURE PAST
**Team Used:** Phoenix's 6th

**Title:** WHAT IF I'M EXILED?
**Unlock Condition:** Win using 3 costumes inspired by EXILES or WHAT IF? comics while fighting in a Capcom stage.
**Stages:** BONNE WONDERLAND, DEMON VILLAGE, CHAOS AT TRICELL, TRICELL LABORATORY, or METRO CITY
**Team Used:** Dormammu's 5th

**Title:** Ultimate Defiance
**Unlock Condition:** Win a match using three characters whose outfits are inspired by Marvel's Ultimate Universe.
**Stage:** Any
**Team Used:** Hawkeye's 4th

Props for the other videos goes to their respective poster, but posted them here for the benefit of others who have undertaken the struggle of mastering Tony. A big thanks to them for pushing Iron Man's potential further.

**THIS NEW GUIDE IS 100X BETTER**

* Clockw0rk is one of the authors
* tournament-quality combos (no pansy shit)
* extremely in-depth guides to general character strategies
* intro section before the characters is 60 pages of game info **META GAME EVOLUTION OF VANILLA**, jumping frame data, dashing rates, soooo much information.
* vanilla version = 390ish pages
* each character has tons of insight. 10ish pages full of frame data, air-throws, ground throws, AA, etc). 

Basically
[C. Viper's combo page(shitty picture to avoid copyright stuff)](http://i.imgur.com/qcpjT.png) (notice that the first combo on the page is the 2nd combo in the list)

Things to notice:

* Not combos for bitches
* technique guide for execution (I wish I had somewhere to tell me to delay the air MMH as she hulk in order to get the OtG on time a few months ago)
* combos start on different attacks
* Meter gain or loss after the combo (especially useful for choosing which Chi to use as Iron Fist
* thorough explanation under every combo


And if you haven't been convinced, capcom gave you a free, amaaaazing guide. I hope I convinced a few.

1362584669.0,19s2lo,"Since we're talking about tier charts, here's a chart I've been working on for the past week, focusing more on how characters rank in team synergy and needs rather than 1v1 strengths.",Evil_Toaster,29,45

Here's how I define each angle of the chart.

**Strong Asset:** Characters that bring valuable tools to the team. That can be anything from a good DHC, unblockable setups, or just a great assist or anchor capabilities.

**Liability:** These are characters that could have a ""problem."" Carry characters, etc. **This does not mean the character is a ""bad"" character,** it only means they can bring a team down, and require special attention.

**Independent:** These are characters that are good on any team, are meter efficient, and have enough tools to survive on their own.

**Reliant:** These characters need their team. The more reliant

[](/twipoker)Honestly, or at least not just one.

Also, that's a fact. However, if you work for her, she becomes a great asset. Strider is strong enough to play alone, but to compete with the rest of the cast, he needs specific characters. It's a weird balance, and as far as the extremes go

What are good moves to use with him, movement abilities, best assist choices, when to Foot Dive etc. What do you use to control space, what kind of mixups, resets and personal gimmicks do you have? Let’s share information on how to make Doom the most effective character he can be.

**Doctor Doom**

* 1

* Mashable Hypers: Photon Array

* Primary Focus: Force your opponent into the corner with midscreen combos and strong projectile game, guaranteeing a full combo from standing H.

**Assists**

* Plasma Beam - One of  the best beam assists in the game. Crushes many other projectiles

* Hidden Missiles – Shoots off 6 tracking OTG-capable missiles (That persist even if Doom is hit) that follow the opponent

* Molecular Shield (Rocks) – Damages opponents at point blank range fairly quickly

**Misc Knowledge**

* Doom cannot cancel his normal dash into anything

* Doom has great air mobility

* Air M has a deceptively large hitbox, airdash down-forward, air M, land and keep going.

* Empty Tri-Jumps into low L are fantastic for starting offense

* Tri-Jump Air M (superjump &gt; airdash down-forward+M) convers the most range of all doom’s tri/square dash options. 

* Doom can cancel grounded basic attacks into ground dashes immediately

* Ground Dash is jump cancellable

* Brady Guide: “If an opponent guards cr.L, airdash down forward low L

Nova: Energy Javelin is an OTG as well as a groundbounce.

In XF3 after an airthrow, then do Nova Punch H into combo (least that's what I do in certain screen positions when it's optimal)

Without XF, quickly dash downward and cancel the dash with a.H to land faster. Once on the ground, you can dash up and c.M into whatever combo.

Now this can easily be avoided by just doing Cent Rush L but I enjoy this instead.

Edit: If this is done on a corner character instead

Viper: Now no one believes me on this but Viper's Burst time or otg super is a low hitting super.

It is also the only super that can beat Zero's Genmu Zero (level 3 hyper) in projectile durability and cancel it out.

Yes, and Viper will protect her teammates.

However

So, I decided to go ahead and make my own. This way, I could see if I really wanted to use the product to begin with.

""Finished"" product:

http://i.imgur.com/BuzcY.jpg

Note: This thing is definitely a work in progress. Furthermore

Tools used:

+ A Dremel with Multipurpose cutting Bit and Sanding bits
+ A WWE Brawlstick ($50)
+ Some Extra 30mm Sanwa buttons (yay!) plus some leftover brawl stick buttons (boo!)
+ Some [Quick Disconnects](http://www.lizardlick.com/Crimp-Connectors_c_203.html)
+ Some 22 gauge speaker wire
+ Plexiglass from Home Depot

So

+ http://i.imgur.com/28Lqb.jpg

Next

+ http://i.imgur.com/hnmcY.jpg

From there

From there disconnecting the stick is easy -- there is a connector that attaches to the stick that is only lightly glued in place. Wiggle it a bit

+ http://i.imgur.com/VSNvq.jpg

After that

+ http://i.imgur.com/PfnMI.jpg


At this point

+ http://imgur.com/7SlJu.jpg

From there just before I took the turbo/Home button PCB out

+ http://i.imgur.com/wzvwe.jpg

...to gain access to the 5 screws on the aluminum case top. 

+ http://i.imgur.com/AFVt0.jpg

I removed these screws to completely open the case since I was going to replace the top with ""new"" plexiglass

+ http://i.imgur.com/E1LhD.jpg

Next

+ [Scanned pic](http://imgur.com/gly41.jpg)

Manipulated it to remove the hole for the joystick. MSPAINT FTW!:

+ [Scanned pic

And then finally I flipped three of the button holes from one side to the other to make the left, and copied a single on over to make the up hole (remember, UP is separated from the other buttons). Ghetto, yes I know, but I just wanted to make my own proof of concept.

+ [Final picture.](http://i.imgur.com/aCEQO.jpg)

I then printed this out and used it as a template for the plexiglass.

Since I had never in my life worked with plexiglass, the final picture above was my best work, and it still turned out crappy. I am eventually going to revisit cutting plexiglass, but for now, I am done with thee!

Also of note, so Dremel it was :(

+ http://i.imgur.com/YeYzB.jpg

So, so I had to make a few cuts to it to have all of the buttons fit.

+ http://i.imgur.com/qi1fw.jpg

+ http://i.imgur.com/6taor.jpg

Here is the semi finished product. 

+ http://i.imgur.com/kP6XF.jpg

Here are the button checks to make sure that all of the buttons fit

+ [Case with buttons inserted

From there

+ http://i.imgur.com/p1Q9D.jpg

Here is a picture of the PCB that contains the controls for the Joystick. It went Ground, Up, Down. I labeled each wire, and then cut off the connect that would have went into a joystick.

+ [PCB of Joystick](http://i.imgur.com/iNbDx.jpg)

Each Button has an Input

+ [Daisy chain](http://i.imgur.com/ZNrGU.jpg)

...that I connected all the directional buttons to. I wish I had also inserted a barrier strip so as to clean up everything in the case and make it look *purdy*

+ [Totally unfocused horrible internal wiring complete picture](http://i.imgur.com/huZi5.jpg)

Finally I put everything together...

+ [Final Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Poihj.jpg)

...But it was not until I started playing MVC3 for testing did I notice something: because I did a direct copy and flip of the first three attack buttons in making my template

So, though in the pictures the directional buttons were all standard issue Madcatz buttons. These Brawl stick buttons may not be bad for attack buttons, but for movement, they sucked donkey dick so I went back in and inserted my last four SANWA buttons into the directionals. 

I am still having issues doing double jump combos with certain people in Mission Mode (Dante and Arthur) but I am almost back to normal with my team of She-Hulk, where surprisingly it was Spencer that I took awhile to get readjusted to on the GHB.

I am still playing through against the computer, but I am not comfortable yet going online because I still have to *think* to jump instead of just jumping.
