Very early on it was Howard himself. He wasn't famous and nobody cared

As Howard got more famous, getting hard hits in while keeping his rapport with guests.

That role came into its own with Billie West -- absolute chaos

Artie then filled that role terrifically as well.

I get that Jackie cut off his own head, *but that chair needs to be filled.*

What we have now is the soft Howard without anyone pushing him off the cliff.  He thinks that replacing one epic provocateur with a whole cast of mediocre characters is going to be the same

Sal and Richard?  Benji?  Ronnie? Who has the balls to say offensive things to guests?  If Leno came in tomorrow who would be what the Jackie Puppet was to Conan

You can painfully see a bland WWE format getting played out now.  So-and-so is a character

Ronnie's crazy, Eric the Midget is the heel.  Howard is now just a ringmaster.  A Vince McMahon.

The problem is that Howard is both terrible and completely wasted as a ringmaster.  Someone who just sits there and says ""Do you have anything to say about what Ronnie just said to you?""  

It's tepid. Even Howard's bored.

Howard needs a genuine bomb thrower in the studio. Someone that Howard has to actively restrain and can let off the leash to do the dirty work when it's necessary.  Without that entropy it's just a talk show with occasional carny tricks and yelling.

Howard, self-loathing people to be what you need. 

You've surrounded yourself with a large number of discount B-players.  If you go find one more great one

1366990276.0,1d5pv6,Bob Lefsetz wrote about Howard again this AM,fauxhipster,50,9,31,"I miss Howard.

I hope Mr. Stern is having fun on AGT this week, he's abandoned his hard core and we're going through withdrawal.

This is not about Howard Stern. You don't have to subscribe to Sirius or listen to his radio program to understand the point I'm making. That to truly triumph you've got to be so good that we miss you when you're gone. Which is rare in today's overmarketed society. You keep telling us to pay attention when what we really want to do is run away. Then there are performers who we just can't get enough of

Last weekend I read ""The New York Times"" and was stunned how mediocre most of the writing was. And the ""Times"" eclipses every newspaper but the ""Wall Street Journal."" Then I came across an article by Philip Roth and it intrigued me and cut like butter,"" but it's undeniable that Roth can write.

So I'm pushing the buttons on the Sirius dial and I get a bunch of people laughing on the Cosmo channel. This is entertaining why? This is how television news has been ruined over the past four decades

And just because they call it the morning zoo, there has to be continuity and plot, no one can watch, never mind listen to, fireworks all day long.

You start listening to Stern and you wonder who all the extraneous people are. Ronnie Mund? Scott DePace? And then their personalities are revealed

And instead of being constantly self-deprecating, Howard veers from side to side, edge to edge. He says how he goes to parties and he gets uptight because he's got nothing to say, the people scare him. Wow, I feel exactly the same way!

And then there are the interviews. Amy Schumer revealed she made 900k last year and I was astounded. My best friends won't tell me how much they make. And when I tweeted about it

That's the modern paradigm. Nobody is the king of all media

And if you're playing to people outside it, only those who care pay attention. And more people listen to Howard than watch the late night talk show hosts the mainstream press keeps bloviating about.

Now I'm not saying Stern should do what I want him to

As for Howard's core fans... Listen to the Superfan Roundtable, featuring diehard fans like Natalie Maines. And you're probably clueless as to all this, but that's how strong a bond people have to Howard Stern.

And unlike everything but hoity-toity NPR

And it's all because he's so damn good.

You think it's just talking into a microphone. You think anybody can play the guitar, and dedication... Howard does lament that AGT interferes with his schedule, he doesn't have enough time to prepare!

And you can hear his preparation. And he extracts information from his guests no one else does. Since it's radio the interviews go on forever. They're not beholden to the Letterman formula

Life is not a punch line.

Life is a series of highs and lows, you yearn for Howard Stern like your best bud from college, you just want to have conversation that's in the pocket, that makes you feel alive and connected.

I'm stunned how much time I dedicate to Howard.

But after this execrable week

Howard Stern built Sirius. Without him

That's the power of the individual

If you're not so damn good that people clamor for you when you go away

Howard

P.S. Radio, but what you keep doing. Dedicated fans don't want reruns, they want new stuff. There's never enough new stuff for a hard core fan, isn't that my point? By constantly creating new material, playing to the core, not worrying about the penumbra, Stern is doing what modern musicians should be doing but refuse to. You're not selling hits, but can you sustain?

For Howard to breeze through this major news story, and I'll say it again: Howard Stern's lost his balls.

You can go on and on about the show maturing, sadly, in a bit of a rut - but nothing's perfect. 

But this?  This is incredibly sad.

I used to think of Howard as a common-sense, in his own way, for freedom and independence.  A champion for the downtrodden and a thorn in the side of authoritarianism.

HOWEVER, so it's the first time I hear him grumble and think he might actually leave his current broadcasting arrangement.  ...but even if he does, that doesn't mean the show is over.   

If you remember them doing the story about how much that fucktard Glen Beck makes charging his legion of 300,000+/year), imagine what Howard can do with his 7MM+ fanbase who are currently paying more than twice that per month for him, on average.  If 7million people pay Howard $10/per month directly for his show, that's $840,000,000 per year.  If he charges only five, still $210mil EVERY YEAR!    It would be STUPID of him him to stay at Sirius vs. doing the same show on his own streaming/podcast network,self,

OK, etc. to start putting up old shows again. Now, a word of note about this particular show... it was a live show and therefore the audio is, well... it just ain't great. Listenable, sure... but it'd be hard to enjoy the musical performances. But stuff like this will likely never be reaired on H100. (Some of the local Dallas commercials are left intact and there are one or two small ""jumps"" when the cassettes recording were switched. Aside from that this is the full show.)

- Bob did a lot of stuff for free for them. Recording bumpers
- Tim Sabean told Bob that he felt Bob should be paid for all his contributions. Bob said two plugs a week for his shows would be payment enough. (Bob makes it a point to say the little money they could scrounge up wouldn't be enough
- Howard and Gary agree to plugs.
- Miserable Men begins on H101. Bob states he and all comedians worked for free.
- Finally
- First Killers of Comedy show happens
- Bob and his wife said no to having their wedding taped by HTV. He then says this was adding to his having a bad rep in the ""Stern plantation"" (comparing the Stern show to slavery.)
- Tim had told Bob Howard was going to pull all his plugs but that he would give him one plug back if he didn't go on O&amp;A.
- Bob had to fight Tim to allow Jimmy Norton (from O&amp;A) to be on Miserable Men.
- Mis. Men expands to four hours
- Howard goes off on all the plugs because of four Levy plugs in a row. Levy states Howard was actually mad about a long Chuck Zito plug
- Bob calls in and Howard said he had no problems with Bob. Everything goes back to normal
- Bob calls Tim
- Bob finds he is banned from the building. When he calls up Tim's assistant
- He calls the next day
- He calls yet again the next day. Jarrod goes back to the assault story.
- This next part shouldn't be TL;DR'd: ""Seeing how this cycle was going Bob decided to go back to his good old standby bit
- He says Stern called the police and FBI about the threat. They showed up ""after checking out the situation they informed Bob that he's much too talented to be playing these games. He needs to just move along with his career
- Bob starts doing a bit for O&amp;A

--------

That ends the TL;DR

- Commenter says he fucked himself over with the death threats. Bob says: ""sorry im not a pussy he fucked with me i went after him and i heard he was shitting in his pants from people there ""
- Commenter asked what was up with him and Artie fighting on the show. Bob says: ""me and artie always fucked with each other the rant on the crap up show he told me stay outside for 10 minutes i got a great idea..as we drove home together he told me about it ..i said thats brilliant and we listen to it in my car laughing the whole ride home""
- Why did he take the bullshit for so long? Bob says: ""because of the promise its coming soon its coming soon""
- Bob goes on to say to someone else: ""i could have got on any show i got on the stern show ..me ..do you get it i could have gone to anyone at that time and i make a living as a comedian and was doing great before i went on his show""
- Bob responds to someone who didn't believe his tale about the cops and what they said to him: ""they sat me down they said bob you cant do this we listen to the show your a talented guy you dont need this just move on and i said i was ..they said he's very scared""
- Commenter asks when he'll be on Artie's show again
- Commenter asks if he knows what's up with Robin: ""no man last response i got from someone who didnt stick up for me and tell the truth to howard said ..i cant lose my job i said ok faggot ..there all scared and weak""",self,t5_2qnxc,1368553023.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1ebg61/the_tldr_of_bob_levys_true_story/

To give you an idea at guessing: Fred was considered the head writer of the show before Jackie was given the title of co-head writer. BUT, that figure for Jackie was with stand up gigs.)

Now, considered a co-host as she takes over control of an hour of the show.)

Now, has a breakdown for most of the on air talent. Since he uses it as a source (especially when guests come in) it might mean that he believes it because of other stuff he's seen for people he knows. Here it is:

- Fred Norris: $6 million a year (with a net worth of $16 million.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/fred-norris-net-worth/)
- Robin Quivers: $10 million a year (with a net worth of $45 million. [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/...celebrities/robin-quivers-net-worth/)
- Benjy Bronk: $3 million net worth (site doesn't say how much a year
- Gary Dell'Abate: $4 million/yr (with a net worth of $15 million.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/gary-dellabate-net-worth/)

- JD: $50
- Ronnie Mund: $500
- Sal Governale / Richard Christy: The site only lists Sal and says he's worth a total of $400

Now, Ronnie's TV deals and his Block Party money, Richard's residuals from Iced Earth and Charred Walls of the Damned sales, Sal and Richard's stand up money... and glaringly missing is a mention of Howard's AGT deal - so suffice to say the site is a bit out of date on his figure at least.",,False,self,False,t3_151ynm

Obviously Fred and Robin never need to work again (and I doubt that Robin will). Bababooey might not have to ever work again but I can see him producing for a TV talk show. Most of the back office staff could work in TV or radio production. 

But what about Sal and Richard? I don't see that they have much of a future in show business. They aren't stand up comics. Their writing seems limited to phony phone calls and dick jokes. It seems to me like it's all downhill for these guys after Howard retires. What do you see them doing?

This was in the notepad file. 

*""The Howard Stern Show - Musical Memories""
WIZN 106.7 FM ('The Wizard')
Burlington
Air Date: Friday
Announcer: Mike Luoma


Howard Stern's long-running syndicated morning FM radio show aired for the last time on Friday, Howard and crew took up residence at Sirius Satellite Radio. Howard's old FM show featured many great musical guests and performances over the years. An FM station that aired the Stern show, WIZN (""The Wizard"") in Burlington, Vermont, played 45 previously taped Stern Show musical performances over four hours during the afternoon following the final 2005 broadcast. I recorded the WIZN ""Musical Memories"" tribute broadcast using a Sansui TU-9900 FM tuner directly to hard disc and then edited out the commercials and as much of the between-song DJ banter as possible. What is left are nearly three hours of classic performances in stellar FM sound quality, thanks in large part to the legendary Sansui super tuner. The relaxed vibe of the Stern Show always seemed to bring out the best in musicians who were not used to waking up and performing so early in the morning!

Some of these tracks have circulated previously as substandard MP3 files sourced from a low-bit-rate Sirius Satellite Radio broadcast, is the genuine lossless FM high-fidelity article. Listen to James Taylor's guitar on ""Woodstock"" or Alanis Morissette's voice on ""Ironic"" for examples of the Sansui's incredible combination of analog musical warmth and detail, which somehow managed to survive largely intact despite the necessary evil of the FM &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC digitization process.

These tunes were either performed in Howard Stern's New York City FM studio or in front of live audiences at remote Stern Show broadcasts. The in-studio tunes include several great acoustic versions of electric favorites (e.g., ""Long Haired Country Boy"" and Train performing a rocking Led Zeppelin medley. One Stern Show inside joke is Blues Traveler's version of ""This Is Beetle."" 'Beetle' is Stern Show ""Wack Pack"" member Lester ""Beetlejuice"" Green, who wrote the song spontaneously one day on the Show. NOTE: The WIZN broadcast also included Staind's version of ""This Is Beetle."" The Staind version, which was the seventh song of the broadcast, is omitted because it was released officially on a limited edition version of Staind's ""Chapter V"" album.

There are so many highlights in this set that it would be tough to pick a favorite. Aerosmith's raucous ""Bacon Biscuit Blues"" is hard to top

I do not know the dates these songs were performed / first aired. If anyone can shed some light on the performance dates

I'm not sure what quality of speakers they were but did they really give him a Sirius home deck wtf? They don't even need to give him any gift at all but since they decided to do it on air it shocked me that the gifts were lackluster. The fact that they gave him Sirius anything is just weird. Its like giving a a set of new tires to someone retiring from Ford Motors. The way Howard was talking before he opened the gift I figured it was going to be something over the top. I was happy cause Ralph Howard has done an amazing job as the new announcer. It just seems like Howard would have slammed anyone who would had given a retiring employee a product of their company.

“Jon!” Eric called. “I’m ready to get out.” *This is the only damn time Jon helps me in the bathroom*

Jon walked into the bathroom. Fresh after a workout

“You look like you lost some weight, submerged body.

Eric sighed. “Just get me out

“That’s what I’m here for

Jon’s trained hands were used to carrying Eric. He put his arms under Eric

The silence was unbearable. Jon’s eyes locked with Eric’s. 

“Eric

Jon choked back tears. “But Eric

“Listen

Not a word was spoken as Jon placed Eric on his bed. Eric

Eric still refused to face Jon. He silently logged into Twitter.

Jon continued, Artie, The Bunny Ranch… you can lie to all of them but you can’t lie to yourself.”

Eric remained silent. Finally he spoke. “Jon

Jon cleared his throat and wiped his eyes. “Ok

Eric slammed his hands against the keyboard. He wanted to scream. Flashes of Diana Degarmo

Eric then took a long breath and threw his hands in the air. *Then why is the only name I hate besides Eric the Midget is… Eric the Liar?*

He has his hands tied when it comes to budget and hiring talent for the other programs (see Bubba and Ferall) and he probably isn't motivated to go above and beyond in any way because of the feud as well.

Anyways

Well I heard some good news on a special Bubba show last night. He said that after over 2 years of no communication with Sirius they are back in talks about bringing Bubba back to the Howard channels or even giving him his own set of channels. He said Tim Sabien and Howard were both enthusiastic and that for the first time things actually look like they might be moving.

I know a lot of you guys don't like Bubba but I think this indicates a general move in the right direction for programming at Sirius. The management over the last few years has been horrible and a change is definitely a positive thing. They need to get back to hiring actual radio talent and not all the bullshit no-name people we hear on the channels these days.",self,t5_2qnxc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1566q2/changes_for_the_better_may_be_coming_in_2013/

Why?  Because he helped Ron Jeremey and Tabitha Stevens film a porn in Howards studio and even at his console (if i recalll correctly).

[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Mroszak#Howard_Stern_Show) - On February 7, rather playing ""a Steven Spielberg type role"" and that the film had been destroyed. On February 8, 2007 Howard questioned whether Mroszak could ever again be trusted, while Fred described the porn antics as ""a sign of disrespect."" In 2009 Ron Jeremy confirmed that Mroszak acted in the movie.
