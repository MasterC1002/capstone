So I got to thinking: how can we keep this sub alive?

Simple. This sub can be a catch-all for anyone who has acquired a safe, briefcase, birthday present, treasure chest, oak barrel, thumb drive, bottle, storage unit, maybe even a confidential file. These people then post a picture of the object

So what do you guys think? Good idea? Share your thoughts.

***TL:DR - Not an April Fools joke

Hi safechasers :) Thanks for hangin' out. I took a brief Reddit holiday for a week to bury my Grandfather and decided to leave it for a bit longer until the whole april fools thing blew over. 

I'd like to say a personal thanks to all the kind users who sent me and the mods mail since I saw you guys last, /u/godmoderage and /u/IWHBYDBTDGOTFF for the kind PM's amongst the wall of orange, I was considering taking people's advice and just not posting again until I had it open, but you guys helped me trust Reddit again :) As a relative newbie, the wall of abuse was really hard to take, and I started dreading logging in.

/u/x3oo sent through some [awesome links](http://carlitoscontraptions.com/2009/07/gentle-safe-cracker/) for making a safecracker, according to /u/jasperspaw, who sent:

&gt;* Fact. The built in manufacturer's tolerance is sufficient that you can dial every second number. 50x50x50 is 125k combs to run through.
&gt;* Fact. The design has a known defect that they fixed by not setting any wheels on numbers under 20. Some older models left the dial blank between 0-20. So it's 40x40x40
&gt;* Fact. You don't have to dial the full sequence for every trial #. Dial 4x left to 20, 1x right to the drop in. Then dial 1x left to 22, then right to drop in, 1x left to 24, et c. You'll be able to feel the cam contact the wheel each time you pick it up to move to the next number. You can do this with the first 2 wheels, but it takes more concentration, so it won't really save time. Advancing the third wheel like that will help a lot.
&gt;Something else. A lot of people use a single # combination for convenience. Try simply 4x left to 20, 26...

&gt;Note: I often set my personal safes with #s in the forbidden zone. It makes it harder for locksmiths to get at my shit. The problem with the ""forbidden zone"" is that after you unlock the safe, you can use those numbers, and test it, and if it doesn't jam, it's fine, Most users follow the instructions.


I'm taking the slow route and putting some brains into it, it doesn't matter if Reddit wants a big fake ""Move that bus!"" moment, and it's not about attention or karma or anything else.


I will attempt another live stream when possible, or programming arduino boards etc - drop me a line, or check out the solutions thread.  I'm going to bed, I'll try and reply to any questions later.

[META QUESTION] Should I just forget the updates and post a link when we open it? Or would you rather see how we're doing?


Thanks for everything :) DSMS

Bumping this thread because not much to report, and even another safecracking company said they were the 'best in the business'. We're working to set up a time for a technician to make a site visit to inspect the crank handle and see how much work it will take to repair, one can possibly inspect it tomorrow and the other company is booked up till friday.


I need to travel north tonight after work so I won't be around to reply to comments sorry


Thanks! This sub is just the beginning :) DSMS

[EDIT: I guess I should crosspost this to the main page

**Commonly asked questions:**

* No we will not drill it. Anywhere. There is already a hole


* The tape IS very interesting

* The handle is completely ground off

* We will look into starting a KickStarter once we have a RELIABLE QUOTE from a reputable company


* We have permission to crack the safe from the (current) owner as long as we DON'T DAMAGE ANYTHING. 





=============================================

**[Old update from yesterday as per header

Been at work all morning, we got through a tonne of stuff last night and the manual really helped as we were entering the numbers wrong. Also a massive thanks to my mods who have been teaching me how to reddit, please understand the wall of text is *very* hard to keep up with, but I'm slogging through it and every upvote for a good post helps. We're dropping all the meme posts so the sub can develop itself, and it's great to see people getting into the spirit of it and submitting their own. This whole thing isn't about the karma, it's all about finding out WHATS IN THAT FUCKING SAFE!

**WHAT WE'VE DONE**

* Contacted a safe expert. We couldn't do this yesterday because it was a sunday night, but I'll be ringing around a few different places in the meantime and trying different people.

* Tried a bunch of combinations using the manual and factory settings from the solutions thread

* Tried sticking a security camera in the hole. It didn't fit. We've had an offer from a local guy in my PMs


**WHAT WE CAN'T DO**

* Damage the walls, we can't smash into it. 

* Drill the door. We don't want to damage the locking mechanism before a safe expert can inspect it. We are getting quotes and will update as we get them.

* Blow it up. But thanks for the suggestion!




Thanks for your help and patience, and make sure if you see a post like this you bump it to the top. The mod team and I are working together to get this subreddit running smoothly, and the front page is already looking better.

I'll update you as soon as I know any more. Cheers guys!

 And no, and it's going to be in your hands instead of relying on the tight schedules of the companies you've contancted, or on your own budget. I almost feel like Oprah. Not really at all though. 

I've secured an borescope in Auckland. I can have it sent by courier tomorrow

It will record video straight into your laptop, that would probably be easier and minimize delays. A second simple web cam can capture the action. I can get take the video files and slap them together with some prewritten background info, add some music, credit who ever helped, have OP review it, then post it to youtube, probably within an hour or two of the safe contents inspection, you could live stream it or pretend it's live

This is the internet though

The borescope is simple and easy to use

AS OP's said

But maybe if there's nothing worthwhile in there, if that's what you're into. I recommend keeping the focus on the contents of the safe. That's what intrigues me, not people talking about the safe.

This could be a wrap

Otherwise

I'll bet you one big silver coin that if there's silver or gold on cash or drugs inside

And if you do make some cash

Just as a neighborhood-wide yard sale was closing down one evening, but my friends paid him a quarter for it because there was an unlabeled tape stuck inside.

[The mysterious VCR.](http://i.imgur.com/zCJst4x.jpg)

This thing was massive: modern car frames are made out of lower grade steel than this thing. Immediately upon getting this cold-war era monstrosity back to our ratty college pad, this relic would neither play nor eject the tape. The screws embedded in the case were lodged in place and resisted all attempts to turn them.

The only thing for it would be to forcibly remove the tape from the VCR and put it in another player. This was the point that I got involved

We spent some futile minutes banging on the metal casing on top

The one we have already called is the first one they recommended, they charge about 100 bucks an hour and the other company is booked up till friday. I've also emailed pictures to their technicians and I'm waiting to hear back from them. 

* I got a PM from a local NZ locksmith and we have exchanged contact details

* I met with an ex safe installer last night

We basically need help with the combination now, check out [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsInThisThing/comments/1ai17j/mod_post_lets_get_this_subreddit_a_little/) to find out what's happening, or give us some feedback :)

**Commonly asked questions:**

* No we will not drill it. Anywhere. There is already a hole above the door so we do not need to drill into the wall / mortar. We are working on getting an endoscope. We can't drill the door incase we damage it before a safe technician can look at it.


* The tape IS very interesting, and it had been spun since, many times. Keep going with the theories though, I like the length theory better. We are trying all sorts of different ideas surrounding it.

* The handle is completely ground off

* We will look into starting a KickStarter once we have a RELIABLE QUOTE from a reputable company


* We have permission to crack the safe from the (current) owner as long as we DON'T DAMAGE ANYTHING.

The reason we are implementing this rule is because a lot of people have been just submitting pictures of safes and other locked things as an easy way to get karma and never actually opening them up. This way, then you may post a link to get some of that sweet sweet karma.

If you have any comments regarding this new rule,META,False,self,t5_2wn3k,1366343624.0,META,True

I guess I'll post them to r/bookie_safe since I was dumb enough to create it.  I can update here as well if that's easier for everyone.

 [Original Post] Bought this house last year and found out after a month or so that a cabinet in the garage had a 12"" wall safe encased in 1

Previous owner was a real estate agent who bought it as a rental and never opened the safe.  Owner before him was a stock broker who was disbarred and subsequently arrested by the local police for running the largest sports gambling ring in my state.  He went to prison for 10 years and died there.  He gifted the house to his daughter who sold it to the real estate agent.

I've had friends offer me $2

I've been told it will cost me $400-600 to open it by the company who put it in in 1981.  They no longer have any records of the safe combination.

Would you like me to share my journey to open that bitch and see what's inside? 

Unlike OP of r/whatsinthisthing I will not disappoint.

*EDIT: NEW PIC! [Proof] (http://i.imgur.com/6uIAnWI.jpg)

Update :  I've been told drilling through the concrete in the back and then through the 1"" steel body may not be as hard as it sounds.  Does anyone have ANY experience with this sort of thing?  How many, and then plate steel of the safe itself?   Also, I'm thinking I'll at least go over to the house tonight or tomorrow and sledghammer that wood off just to A) give Reddit some nice update photos and B) find out what the rest of that pig looks like.

* Edited to update with accurate info about previous owner.  My bad for being over eager to post the story this morning.

**Opening a commercial safe is not an overnight process!**

 - As of 3/26/13
 - Finding a locksmith that can open a commercial safe can be expensive. This is even more expensive if the safe turns out to be particularly difficult to open.
 - People have lives. They work, ect. Give them a reasonable amount of time to deliver.
 - It would be nice if they would deliver in a somewhat timely fashion
 - A universal rule on Reddit: **No (IRL) witch hunts.**

edit: In OP's case

That being said

 - If you post a safe
 - Updates should be *actual updates*
 - If you ask for suggestions
 - edit: Time should not be wasted with unreasonable solutions or foolish triflings. Entertain us by opening the safe. [Don't screw around. You screw around too much.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wzg1oqDgkI)

I wanted to share this story, I think you might enjoy it too.

My Grandma passed about 4 years ago.  This last fall

My Grandma and Grandpa built a house on about 45 acres of land along a well known river in a small town in Wisconsin.  They had been there for 50 years or so and with so much land

On the property, and about 8 different big barns, garages and sheds they had built while living there.  

As we cleaned out each garage, my younger brother bumped a 'wall,' with the broom and it made a very distinct hallow sound.  Upon becoming curious enough, my Dad and I pulled away this 'dummy,' wall that was basically ply wood that was painted to look like the rest of the walls.  Behind it, was this *giant* safe.

My Dad and I were giddy.  Neither of us expected to find this and didn't know what could be inside.  After the fact,000lbs.  I realize that sounds ridiculous...but that is how big this thing is.

Getting in the safe was another thing.  Seeing both Grandparents had passed

It wasn't until we had almost given up and decided to call a professional to open the thing that I caught a number written on the rafter of the garage.  It was old

Ok

- About 800 silver coins (mostly silver dollars) dating as far back to the late 1800's and as current as 1964.  (Valued at around 15k if sold to a dealer now).

- A Winchester 30/30

- A .410 shot gun

- Paper bills and 'treasury notes

- A deed to property we didn't even know existed.  

- Other family antiques that were cool to us

Now, etc.  What I have pictures of are a few of the coins, the 30/30, and the safe.  I do have all the coins currently in my safe at my home.

I apologize this is a rather wordy post!  I just think it's kind of a cool story and hope you'd find some interest in it as well.

1. Why was the plastic bag covered in a white fibrous paste? I have two hypotheses. Either it was to prevent humidity from entering or it was to be able to know if the keys had been touched because it was impossible to access the keys without removing the paste.

The previous owner told me there was a floor safe in the garage that he'd never opened and that he assumed was put in by the previous owner to him

Flash forward. I like to have a summer project. Last year I built a lovely rendition of battle shots. [Battleshots in the making](http://i.imgur.com/1Ulcr8M) and [Battleshots completed](http://i.imgur.com/JeTNPhk) . So this summer I decided to see if I could build a robot to brute force open the safe.

Here's what we're dealing with. [Cover on safe](http://i.imgur.com/NNEJ58X) and [Safe exposed](http://i.imgur.com/9HC47AL)

So instead of starting from scratch in SketchUp and AutoCAD

Some background on the safe: I've already contacted the manufacturer and they said that the combination was lost in a fire at Star Safe. So that was a burn (pun). I've talked to the current company and it can be brute force opened. I've talked to a lock smith and it can be drilled and opened from anywhere from between $200-$500.  But that's not fun!  I talked to a safe expert up in Northern California and he helped me create the algorithm to open the safe:

&gt; 4 times left to the first number
&gt; 3 times right to the second number
&gt; 2 times left to the third number
&gt; 1 time right to zero (0) - push the dial down and continue right until
&gt; the dial stops (around 70-75).
&gt; Note:  When you push the dial down at ""0""
&gt; correct
&gt; combination is incorrect the dial will NOT remain down.
&gt; Note:  Left is counter clockwise
&gt; revolutions of the dial
&gt; the 12 o'clock index mark (star - index).

I've got a few technical papers that discuss the way that I can eliminate possible combinations because of the mechanics of the lock. So I should be able to get it down from the theoretical 1 million combinations to something like 100k-200k.

So that's where I'm at. I've got a friend with a 5axis CNC machine if I need to build any parts

I think I have a fun summer ahead. I'll post pictures of designs and code I'm using as a go along. I'm going to document as much as I can and definitely shoot video of the Geraldo Moment. (it'll be a trending hashtag on twitter soon).

Any advice or hurdles that any other redditors have experienced would be awesome. I'm guessing I should probably x-post this with r/robotnerds (does that exist) or something.  We'll see where this adventure takes us.  WOO INTERNET.

I dont know how my dad ended up with this pay phone but I remember trying to break into it as a kid with no luck of course. There are some coins rolling around in there mainly but I think it would be good to restore but I cant take it apart without unlocking those three locks

[I did a bit of research](http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Newsletter/May11.pdf) and its a 'Victa 52AUX Red Phone' from the yearly 70's. I'm hoping the age will make these locks easier to pick.

Any suggestions on how to get started?

**Update #1:**

* I saw Fast and the Furious 6. God that was a terrible movie.
* I found out the story of how we got the phone. My dad was on a job site one day and someone had just thrown the phone on a pile of bricks thus the paint being stripped. So he took it home and didnt touch it for 20 or so years.
* Thanks to u/libussa3 for finding the master key on ebay which I purchased!
* After some more research I found the same phone (fully restored w/ full set of keys) going for $1200.
* I will take more photos for those asking tomorrow with something that isnt a camera phone.
* Once the master keys comes I guess the project begins and will keep this post updated. What I'm curious about is that when I shake it I can only hear a couple of coins but I distinctively remember it being full when I was younger so there could be some grime build up on the inside making everything stick.

**UPDATE 5/28/2013:  PARTS HAVE BEEN ORDERED! I'll create a new post once I have a working prototype**

After a few weeks of design and testing and talking and breaking things

Here's the newest iteration of the robot sketched on in pencil because I'm old school and don't really want to build this all in CAD. 

[Sketch](http://i.imgur.com/0hn0eQR.jpg)

I'm going to order the following stepper motor:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9238

Stepper motor controller:
http://schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/

Linear actuator to push the dial in after every combination:
http://store.firgelli.com/category_s/1849.htm

And probably a NEMA-17 mount for the motor.

I found that I can use the IR line finder sensor with the ultrasonic sensor as a backup to test if the dial has come back up

Only concerns and research left are to make sure I have enough torque on the stepper motor to turn the dial. That the linear actuator has the the 4.5lbs of force to depressed the dial using the motor mechanism (and conversely that it has enough force to raise the mechanism afterwards). And that the stepper motor is consistent and doesn't slip so I don't need to add an encoder or calibration step.

The last piece that I'm missing is the piece that will interface the motor shaft with the dial holes. I'd like to find some titanium threaded screws that will fit into the universal drive mount's hole: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10006

but that is probably asking too much. I should hopefully have all the parts here by the end of the week to start assembly in the mean time I'm going to be trying to figure out how to interface the motorshaft with the dial wheel.

If I break anything or have any breakthroughs I'll keep y'all updated.

**Update for 5/11/2013:** We've got some real world problems today. After reviewing the tale of the Pantry Safe it would appear we have a similar problem in that my lid won't spin. 

After some solid Arachnid Abatement (have you heard their new album?) I got to work clearing the safe area for a long slog through the *oiling process*. [You can see a clean workspace free from big black spiders](http://i.imgur.com/pylYPts)

[Here's a close up of the corrosion spots](http://i.imgur.com/HjX7Icx)

Being that we're near enough to the beach that everything corrodes I have a feeling that me and a 2lb sledge hammer are going to become the best of friends.

[First treating of PB oil and a battleshots battleship prototype being sacrificed to see what hammering is going to be like](http://i.imgur.com/0NeH0mx)

So it appears that we're going to be on anti corrosion duty for a while. Good thing my DVR is full. 

The next steps are going to be getting another can of PB

**Questions:** 

* I'm assuming that what I'm going for is to get the oil in there as a solvent to dissolve the rust and then hitting it with the hammer is to get the oil further into the crevices and also to loosen its grip.?

* Do I want try to force the lid to spin by using the wood as a buffer against the handle and then try to get some angular shifting?

* While I'm oiling should I cover the top to prevent evaporation? And what's the intervale between oilings? 

Overall it looks like I have to fix the jock problem before I can fix the nerd problem. This safe is like a bad high school metaphor.

So I have all of my parts put together and some diagnostic stuff coded into the device so I can control it from remote.

Here's a video of how I'm coupling the motor to the safe dial:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvpCsvFl7V0

I know

We've named the robot S.C.A.R. for Safe Cracking Autonomous Robot.

I've got some mounting issues to work out still; the way I have the motor and actuator coupled isn't working...so I need to play around with some zipties and see if I can stabilize and orient all the pieces so everything works.  I have a feeling that since I'm eyeballing a lot of the variables there's going to be some loosening here and tightening there to make sure that everything is lined up and not adding shear to anything.

I drilled the safe dial and installed vertical pins to attach to the universal mounting wheel.  Seems to work as predicted.  I'm not getting any slippage in the motor. I'll just need to work on some calibration with regard to ""give"" in direction change on the pins. Then I can start ramping up speed and see how fast I can drive it before it overheats or starts to slip. 

Hopefully I'll have some better calibration updates for everyone once I fix the mounting issue along with a full combination test.

Here's a video in case you missed it of the first bench test of everything put together.

The chest can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/xpt3m). This was found in the back of an old garage, but there's probably some neat things. 

Safe #1 can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/sM0lR). This was purchased at an auction in southern Ohio. The previous owner couldn't get into it and didn't want to deal with it

Safe #2 can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/DZecu). This one is the most interesting I think. It was found in an old closed down grocery store/post office. I imagine it has to be at least 40 or 50 years old

If you know anything about any of these three, but I know very little about locks/safes and they aren't actually mine. I'm basically allowed to do anything but damage them, let me know if you can think of any options. I'll try and post better pictures of safe #2 when it's not nighttime next time I'm over there. Thanks all!


Edit: Heading back over there tomorrow. I do have a stethoscope; since these are old

Edit #2: Opened the chest up! When I'm not on my phone, obviously belonged so someone that made quilts. But then, on the bottom, there was a dry rotted sleeping bag and an army poncho/cap. Odd, but interesting! As for the safes, I've done some reading and am trying to manipulate my way in (unsuccessfully this far).

We drained the bottom pond so we could build a gazebo when we drained the pond we noticed at the bottom of the pond was a safe. I cant remember how big but from what my grandfather tells me it was about the ""normal"" size you would keep on the floor or in a closet, from 5 years before. We gave the person a call and he described the safe exactly. When we opened the safe it had a good amount of old coins from different parts of the globe in it and a few other precious metals (gold and what not). the coins were in a sealed packet and amazingly survived. The owner was so happy to get his safe and stuff back he gave us a pretty good reward. (Just about paid for all the wood for the gazebo.) 

edit: I  a word. 

edit: words

EDIT: I forgot to mention we live on a highway and the robbers most likely didnt want to get stuck with the safe so they rolled it down the hill and into the pond

I can send it to someone via email if they are willing to upload it to a source so that other can view it.  I am posting from my phone and cannot figure out how to post the PDF to a hosting site.

I already cracked (the old fashioned way) another safe in this room.  It was empty.

I don't know if this one will be any better.  I spoke to the prior owner of this house and he indicated that it was already in the wall when he originally purchased.  He said that he never tried to open it.  If true

I looked up the company that used to make it and it appears they are out of business.  Phone number in owner's manual is also no good.

Any ideas?

UPDATE 2:  More information on Aanon Corporation.  After it dissolved


 UPDATE 3:  Safe opened.  Total disappointment.  All that was in there was a Palm Tungsten.  Palm only made it from 2003 to 2005 so prior owner was incorrect; they must have used the safe at some point.  Thank you for all of your help.  Sorry it was not something cool.

First off: get a clear picture, get good images of the hinges, and (if there are any) feet or wheels on the base.

Secondly: No, and produce steam that saturates the interior to displace oxygen and reduce oxidation of the contents) often cracks and ruins the integrity of the container.

There are some exceptions, and the shipping is extortionate because of the weight.

Don't try to force it. Sure- attack the hinges. Like the manufacturer never thought of that! If you go at it and bust off the dial, you're fucked.

If the door is open already

Floor safes: These fill up with dust and dirt from being below floor level. They may often be flat-out busted. If you own one

If you change the combo yourself (not recommended)

Any safe you can buy at a hardware store, but they are fairly easy to crack. Their thickness is mostly plaster of Paris, and they are mainly gauge steel. Opening them destructively is trivial.

The authority that rates safes and vaults for integrity under attack is Underwriter's Laboratory. The safe is tested against tool attack, and how many minutes of attack it will withstand. However, this is ""compressed"" time, in which the attacker has an open safe as a model right next to the one they are working on, and the stopwatch only goes while there is actual attack. So, while a [TL-30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe#Class_TL-30) sounds pretty lame, it will be a bitch to open by the untrained. Note those ratings go up to TXTL-60, tool

Attacks: A trained safe and vault technician can usually penetrate a safe or vault in a fashion that leaves it largely intact. Moreover, it can be restored to service, often with relative ease. But because you don't want a weakness, that point can be defended: drill shields, drill bits (welded into the hole), ball bearings, etc. These will effectively turn the easiest way into the container the *most difficult* way in, grind it down

[Photos of the bunker](http://imgur.com/a/qtn00)

So here's the story: my friend (/u/0oBountyo0) and I were helping some people at my school with some summer work stuff. We had heard that there is a bunker under one of the dorms at our school that the government had used a while back as a communications base. We walked into one of the many rooms in the bunker and found this ~~safe~~ vault. We know it's a huge ~~safe~~ vault because we heard heard a loud echo when we shook the ~~safe~~ vault handle. We also put in the combination but it didn't work. The only thing that happened when we put in the combination was the little S &amp; G logo was able to be turned 90 degrees and clicked in place. However

**UPDATE 7/19**: I went back to the bunker today only to find that it was locked. So I decided that I would come back next week with my friend and try to open the ~~safe~~ vault then. I also had to leave early today so I wasn't able to spend a lot of time running around campus looking for people who had keys to the bunker. My sincerest apologies to anyone who is waiting to know what's inside the ~~safe~~ vault. Oh and apparently it's a vault

**UPDATE 7/22**: Vault has been opened. Nothing too interesting inside the vault (not surprisingly) although I would like to know how it was used along with the rest of the bunker... Thanks for everyone's help! I will post photos of the vault later and then take many more photos of the bunker later this week. [Link to photos](http://imgur.com/a/oqGWv)

I need to figure out something that'll fit in the dial wheel hole and that'll attach to the motor. Once I have that I can do some basic testing on my motors I have. Then if I find out my motors will work (they probably won't). I can work on the calibration to make sure I can hit the +/- 1 digit I need.

Good evening everyone.  I've made some serious robot progress...in that I've got it mounted the safe. The actuator will press the dial down and the motor will turn the dial.  One set back is that Firgelli sent me a wonky bracket so I can't test everything because it's not secure yet. I'm hoping that they'll send me a replacement bracket. 

[Photo 1](http://i.imgur.com/BNsXh6X)
[Photo 2](http://i.imgur.com/XWo3ldH)
[Photo 3](http://i.imgur.com/R93tteI)

What's left from a robot standpoint:

* Actuator bracket to vertical post
* Drilling the safe dial to affix the universal coupler
* aligning the motor so I don't get shear on rotation
* tightening the crap out of everything and lubricating anything that's going to rub (that's what she said)
* wiring every the EasyDriver into an RJ10 jack so i can use the motor driver on the MeBaseShield (makeblock.cc)

So that's what's left on my punch list for the robot mechanics.

Then...the hard part: Automating and sensing correct combo (i.e. dial not coming back up).

Future concerns:

* Alignment is going to be a big concern
* Stuff overheating and melting/fire (luckily everything is concrete around the safe.
* having the dial get pulled back up because the pins that hold the [universal coupler](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10006) are too snug or thermally expand. The coincidence is that this universal coupler is almost the exact diameter of the dial mechanism. 
* patience to make sure that everything is aligned and not to just force stuff.  Mantra: This is not a sprint it's a marathon.

I'm almost there. I can feel it. Speed is not going to be this robots strong suit

The below are general rules. Not all safes will follow these rules

First things first, I can put you in touch with someone.

Otherwise

## Opening cheap modern safes

There are a lot of cheap modern safes

How would I open a cheap digital combination lock safe?

*   **Find the manual**. The safe will have a default code
*   **Call the manufacturer**. Some of these safes have reset procedures that you can get from the manufacturer. You will need to prove ownership. Sometimes you need the serial number which will be inside the safe.
*   **Try hitting it**. A lot of these safes hold the boltwork back using a spring loaded solenoid. If you hit the safe in the right place with a mallet (or [even your hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOdmMb90YEE) on smaller safes) whilst turning the handle
*   **Pick the override lock**. Nearly all of these safes have a mechanical override lock. These are normally cheap [wafer locks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_tumbler_lock)
*   **Try and activate the code reset button**. Many safes have a [small button inside the door](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D33T4GOtB-U) used to change the combination. I've managed to press this button from outside the safe by using a welding rod poked through a mounting hole on the rear of the safe.
*   **Take the front panel off and manually activate the solenoid or motor**. Some of the cheap safes have all of the electronics outside of the safe. If you remove the front panel
*   **Cut the safe open**. I've not seen one of these resist more than a few minutes with even a small angle grinder. The top or back is normally easiest.
Most of the time

## Opening bigger and better safes

If you want to try it yourself

**Non-destructively open the lock**. There are a number of techniques that can be used to open mechanical combination locks - reading contact points

**Drill the safe**. If non-destructive entry is not possible, and this requires a lot of pressure and special drill bits to get through. Most safes have some form of ""[relocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocking_device)"" - additional spring-loaded bolts that will trigger under attack and hold the boltwork shut. You really don't want to trigger these as there is no way to unlock them from outside the safe. The small hole that is left can be filled with hardened steel and welded over for repair.

**Cut the safe open**. This still generally requires skill or knowledge if you don't want to damage the contents. Angle grinders, and thermal lances are tools used here. This can be very time consuming and noisy.

Do you see a theme? You generally need to know what you are doing.

## Opening a vault

Unless you can make a hole in the wall, you should call a safe engineer.

## Old safes vs. new

Most older safes tend to be fairly secure. I believe this is because of two things. Firstly, more solidly.  Secondly, if an old safe has survived this long and not been opened, it's either secure or too damn heavy to throw out.

Old safes have the advantage that most safe engineers won't easily be able to determine how to open the lock or where to drill

A lot of modern safes are cheap crap. Anything you can buy in B&amp;amp;Q can be cut open in under 10 minutes. But a good

## What not to do

There is a lot of bad advice floating about.

**Don't cut the external hinges off the door**. They aren't part of the locking mechanism on even the cheapest safes

**Don't force the handle**. Good safes have boltwork that won't open no matter how much force you apply to the handle. The handle will shear off first or you will break part of the drive mechanism.

**Don't hit the dial or spindle of the combination lock**. The combination lock and door has something called a [relocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocking_device) on it. If you trigger this by hitting it

**Don't attempt to use thermite**. I'm not sure why, it's dangerous, and it will destroy the contents of the safe.

**Don't try a plasma cutter**. Again

**Don't try any other half-cut idea from someone who has no idea what they are doing.** Dousing the safe in liquid nitrogen

**Don't think that opening safes is some kind of mystical black art**. There are hundreds of people who can open safes. The more expensive and secure the safe

**Don't think that the safe will have anything exciting in it**. They very rarely do.

## What do you need in a safe?

After reading all of that

*   **Avoid any digital combination safe that has a mechanical override lock**. Instead of having one good mechanical lock
*   **Look for a good lever lock.** At prices acceptable to most householders
*   **Decide if you are protecting against fire and/or theft.** A lot of ""fire safes"" have extremely poor security. Burglary is far more common than house fire. My safe protects against theft
*   **Avoid any safe that a single person can easily pick up**. You don't need something that weighs 750kg
*   **Make sure you can bolt the safe to the floor and/or wall**. A 50kg safe attached to a concrete floor with 4 expanding bolts is going to be as hard to move as a 500kg safe.
*   **Make sure it is big enough to hold your stuff.** If it can't hold the thing you need to protect
*   **Make sure it is accessible enough that you actually use it.** If it is hidden away

1) Picture of each hinge.
2) Picture of the dial.
3) Picture of the leftover residue from the tape.
4) The hole to the right of the dial (well lit with flashlight).
5) The handle-less turning mechanism (in the center).
6) The outer frame including a few inches of the masonry work.
7) Any alpha-numerics stamped/molded anywhere on the safe.
8) A timeline of the house. Year built? Year modified or additions added? Etc.

From what I can gather with what I've been given

1A) That is a S&amp;G ""D003 dial with R004 ring

2) Unless they had something that was built special

4 times left to the first number
3 times right to the second number
2 times left to the third number
1 time right until the dial stops

The easy way to determine if the lock is three wheels or four wheels would be to count the wheels.  This can be done by parking all the wheels on a neutral number 180 degrees away from the drop in area, but if you don't understand it, or don't know what you are feeling for, you may pick up random noises.

3) If I'm understanding the S&amp;G timelines

4) It would be very helpful to all of us if there was a manufacturer label on the safe door or frame you could show us.

5) There is a very big difference between a ""locksmith"" and ""Safe Technician"".  I wouldn't recommend locksmiths as they usually don't have the training

6) Finally the safe itself looks like it was added after the house was built (although I don't have enough information to explain how they got it down there post build) as it is in a weird location within the basement. Notice the raised foundation. This was most likely done to either keep the goods inside from minor flood waters with it being located in a basement or to raise it high enough to weld it to that steel support beam on the (facing) top left to permanently secure it on the premises. The cinder block surrounding it was meant to more safely secure/protect the safes out shell/walls from external sources albeit them accidental or intentional. And the way the blocks are laid (poorly) is that they were laid out once the safe was placed on the foundation; then once the mortar set

Bit of a story coming. I moved into an apartment that was built in the pre war period. In one corner of the room on the ceiling is a wooden latched door leading to a crawl space between the roof and the apartment. Well me.and a few friends had been drinking and decided we needed to explore wherever this mystery latch lead. I climbed up into the space and announced that I saw a box. It was incredibly dark and I was drunk so I got down. Promptly forgot about it. 

Cue 1 year later. I've hyped this box up to be haunted.  It was a good story to tell friends that were staying the night and happened to be sleeping directly under it. A few of them had nightmares. Good times were had. Tonight we got drunk and remembered that it was up there and with enough alcohol I hoisted a friend up into the space. Here's what we found.

We are having trouble identifying he whiskey company on he bottle. The paint cans belonged to a.company that existed since the 1800s.

It's open so there's unfortunately no hidden treasure. It's still locked however and with no combination we can't do anything with it.

A number of years ago I bought a condo. It was an old apartment building converted into condos.  They were **horrible** and all had to be redone.  The unit next to mine was being done the exact time mine was.  About 2 weeks into it they were working on the bathroom and removed the floor trim woodwork.  Pow $5k in cash sitting there.  Needless to say we were all very very thorough looking in every wall and cavity of the rest of the building.  Nothing but rusty razors for me.  A few years later I bought my new house and gutted it (because it needed it

About a year later my grandfather passed away.  He had started loosing his marbles a few years before that unfortunately.  Sad way to go.  Anyway he gave everything (cash, book hits friend and falls to ground opening to several hundred dollars.  Guess where most of the books were.  Good Will.  Yup he only took a few and the rest were given away.  They rushed to Good Will but by that time some mysterious buyer had purchased them all.  Who knows how much $ my grandfather had hidden away.

You never know.  Keep the faith and always check everything.

You will likely not get in without some damage to the safe.
You could try and Electronic Stethoscope.. basically a microphone with an amplifier so you could listen for tumblers falling.  The internet will have supplies of that item.. and should not be expensive.

Second.. you could try a Diamond wheel cutter on the external mounted door hinges. use water lubrication.

Drilling holes..first you need to locate the exact position of the lock mechanism.. consult the net for info on this.

Using a Titanium drill bit of 3/8 to 1/2 in and lubricated with ROIL Anti Friction liquid.. you should be able to eat thru that baby in no time.. The ROIL is available off the net.. or via your local Neways Health rep[ ( mlm )

Thermic Lance..
Ok this is gonna stuff the safe for sure.. but hey.. you weren't taking it to your next house.. so just open it.. grab the loot.. and wall it up again.
see here..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV4r7OKkXmU

1365329876.0,1buhlo,Let's just do a Kickstarter for Smee already.,Dromaeosauridae,163,168,43,"I know the idea of a Kickstarter project to pay for a locksmith has been proposed

Obviously, because there is reasonable doubt as to dont_stop_smee's motivations/legitimacy.  But at this point, I'd be willing to throw away 5 bucks just to find out if this is an elaborate hoax or not.  I don't even care what's in the safe.

I can't be alone here.  This subreddit has a shit ton of subscribers so even like 1 or 2$ from a small percentage of the subscribers would cover the costs.  I have a feeling many Redditors would even donate 5$ or more.  And if it turns out to be an elaborate hoax... we'll burn that bridge when we get there. Now I understand half the fun is in the journey, after the endoscope failure, now that we're down to waiting for smee to crack this by hand... or somehow by programming and building a robot?  Come on guys.  

If this is going to be done, so if that does turn out to be the case, I don't think people would rage or feel cheated, just because knowing one way or the other still has merit to many of us... just as long as its made clear from the get go that an empty safe is a possibility.  If the project is started and doesn't reach its goal, then fine, whatever, at least we've ruled out that option.  If there's enough interest in at least trying a Kickstarter, then that should be a bright red flag right there.  

I hate to be a  cynical bastard, I just want to know. 

**Edit: One thing I forgot to mention in terms of practicality.  I know Kickstarter has rules about what kind of projects can be submitted, a live stream etc. That sort of thing. So we can see the safecracker at work, and see the opening.  This way it fits the qualifications and we have some proof that money's going where it's supposed to.**

**Edit 2:  Yes I am aware he stated he wants to crack it himself.  I think that's an enviable sentiment, it's not even his safe, and he does not live in the same house as it.  It is not an exaggeration to state his friend's lease might be up before he makes any progress.  Kickstarter is not a perfect plan, and I completely understand the flaws/objections to it.  I'm just pointing out, if you're serious about finding out what's in it, this is by far the only realistic option.**",Other,self,,

Yes it was fake, as the safe opened we would complain about a sudden horrible smell, and little bits of black ooze, played by hersheys syrup would have dripped out the door, just barely noticable for people looking close, but adding a neat subconscious kreepy vibe, then as the door was opening and we move into look at the very dark safe suddenly a goo soaked hand would pop out and splat against the outside of the safe followed by running and screaming for the door all cloverfield style.

Instead I had to resort to giant nerd treasure which seems to have also been pretty fun to a lot of people. The cards are all very much real and certainly for sale if someone can offer a decent price, and no none of the cards were damaged by little baby hands, despite how it may look cards in sleeves are not hurt that easily, also no the baby was not staged, its just hard to keep her out of stuff cuz she is fast like cheetah.

Long live the lulz! Hope most people at least enjoyed the ride.
