But since then, I know this is confirmation bias).

The following is a stream-of-consciousness collection of ideas which support this theory. Just for fun. Please don't think that this is some kind of realistic attempt to figure out the truth behind SRS.

* SRS has a policy of 'crying wolf' with accusations of child pornography and paedophile apologism. I'm fairly sure that most people who have seen them in action are less likely to believe similar accusations in the future.


* They also like to flood any tool that can be used to submit reports of child porography with false reports and divert resources meant to combat sexual abuse to harass people they don't like.


* They have planted CP to get sub-reddits they don't like shut down. Now


* They do their best to promote unhealthy relationships between adults. I think it's quite possible that they are engaging in social engineering to make adults less able to handle complex


* They constantly try to define terms such as 'pedophilia' and 'sexual abuse' as broadly and inconsistently as possible. Could this be an attempt to conflate things which society generally finds terrible with more socially acceptable behaviour and create confusion about where ethical boundaries should be drawn?


* They persecuted /u/violentacrez


* They encourage the diversification and concealment of subreddits which may possibly attract child porn


* They maintain a large and secretive network of fake accounts


* They are mostly white, like 'demisexual' to explain their inability to handle adult relationships. That seems very much like the profile I would guess an 'average' paedophile would have.


* Most of them seem to have some form of personality disorder. Many of them are also mentally ill in other ways and apparently have difficulty interacting with others. That's not only the kind of person that is most likely to be a paedophile (I'm not saying that most mentally ill people are paedophiles


* They don't seem to care that everyone hates them or that they are dragging the reputation of social justice advocates through the mud. I think this could be a sign that being hated for what they seem to stand for is a lot better for them than being seen for what they really are.


* They are very keen to recruit children to their cause. They use deliberately childish memes, but SRS seem to be entirely focused on children.


* I'm sure everyone has noticed how people who hate gays and denounce various 'perversions' often turn out to have been deep in the closet themselves. Those who are most paranoid about being discovered tend to be the most vocal about bashing their own group. I'd be deeply shocked if paedophiles were any different.


* They promote the idea that men who don't letch at adult women and don't seem comfortable displaying attaction openly are actually polite, creepy and suspicious.


* They rail against child pornography and sex with minors

As a young gay man, but some do - I know I did. Fortunately, though, I came to terms with my sexuality, and now I'm proud of it :)

Perhaps SRS (and many other extreme feminists) is dealing with something similar. Deep down, called a bitch/whore/slut, while some dominating masculine beast fucks them silly. They want to be forced to suck cock and be used as a cum dumpster. And various other demeaning, humiliating things.

They hate this part of themselves, some kind of faggot?"". They're projecting their sexual fantasies on real life. There are two reasons for this behavior - it vindicates them in their hateful moments, and then later provides fuel for their masturbatory fantasies.

SRS (and tabloids) really really like decontextualizing because

In case you're worried about things like ""truth"" or ""facts"" or ""intellectual honesty""

&gt; ""WHAT CONTEXT?!""

Exactly. Now you're in the frame of mind to learn.

###**I. ON THE LABEL ""CHILD"".**

&gt; Physiologically a child is anyone under 10-11. After that puberty starts and they're ""tweens"" or ""teens""

This person has a solid point about [equivocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) between the legal and physiological definition of children. 

No matter. If you're thinking like an SRS poster you will pick up one key thing:

""anyone above 11 is not a child (because they are tweens/teens)""

I like to call this the Qualifier Chopper. Actually

All that shit in parentheses? You can just remove it.

&gt; ""anyone above age 11 is not a child""

MUCH BETTER.

Now just add ""WTF"" after it to [prime (text version)](http://tinyurl.com/primingwikipedialink
) [(video version)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1OVhlRpwJc) the person into reading it with a ""this must be something bad"" frame beforehand.

&gt; redditor says anyone over 11 is not a child. [+20] what the FUCK""

PERFECT.

###**II. ON CREEPINESS.**

&gt; Having a big muscled man say ""I'M GONNA RAPE YOU"" is terrifying

This person has made his or her first fault by using the ""x but not y"" construction.

For any ""X but not Y"" construction

Let's do this. The phrase ""not creepy"" clearly exists in this person's sentence.  All we need to do is add a bit of interjections / exclamations like ""holy shit"" and ""what the fuck"" to do our priming work

&gt; Holy FUCKING SHIT [TRIGGER WARNING] redditor says a big muscled man saying he's going to rape you isn't creepy. I'm at a loss for words.

NOW YOU'VE GOT IT!

###**III. ON EMOTIONAL APPEALS.**

Real talk: if someone tries to commit suicide

But suppose you didn't actually ever try to commit suicide

Say one time you got really drunk in a bathroom after your roommate made a series kitchen jokes and you knocked over some DayQuil pills. 

Assuming you're honest

But you have an in here: the fact that DayQuil pills are still pills

Get ready to take a dump on context

&gt; after my roommate made endless misogynistic remarks over the course of the night

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM

###**IV. ON HUMOR.**

Sometimes some jokes are funny because the persona of the person telling them is someone humble

""What do you call a black guy flying a plane? A pilot

Funny as hell

Now suppose you imagine FreeRepublic people telling this joke as a mockery of the *concept* of racism. Like

Who would be so stupid? Imaginary people

Imagine you think of every single person on Reddit like they're from FreeRepublic. Now

With this in mind

&gt; joke on /r/funny: ""HAHA CASUAL RACISM IS SO HILARIOUS. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RACIST. [+500]""

---

###**What is SRS?**

---

/r/ShitRedditSays is a subreddit (a subsection of the website reddit.com) dedicated to ""calling out"" what the subscribers to that subreddit think are bigoted comments. Their definition of 'bigoted' leans toward an ideological feminist definition,""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/13ehki/i_havent_been_laid_in_like_6_months_and_im/) which would suggest they think the term is bigoted or objectionable. This sort of thing would strike a normal person as crass but not bigoted and not very offensive; terms like ""bigoted"" are usually reserved for something far more severe, like ""I don't want my daughter dating a black man."" [Read this if you'd like to know more about how SRS differs from the general population in words like ""bigoted"", ""racist"", ""sexist"" and so on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/187v5w/srs_offensive_vs_normal_person_offensive_the/)

When SRS ""calls out"" a comment this usually means they will respond to it with extensive use of sarcastic tropes, and isn't specific to SRS; it refers to the combination of downvotes and arguing that happens when a subreddit invades another subreddit's discussion.

SRS was initially created by reddit_sux in a SomethingAwful.com thread and led by users Amrosorma

---

###**Does SRS really believe what they say?**

---

The short answer is **yes**

The long answer is that because they communicate mostly through sarcasm, is what they really believe. So if we're discussing gun control and I say ""YEAH, IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE TO LET CONVICTED CRIMINALS BUY GUNS"" the literal meaning is that I am pro-gun for criminals, and obviously I don't mean that, so you will have the impression that I believe some sort of background check is necessary for gun purchases. This paraphrasing of the opponent's position in mocking capital letters is a device I've called [sarcastic paraphrase](http://alfredmacdonald.com/2012/12/26/dissecting-the-frog-on-sarcastic-paraphrase/).

---

###**Are SRS just a bunch of trolls?**

---

This plays into the last question

If you take troll to mean that they don't believe what they say, the vast majority do not. It's tempting to believe that they *are* trolling because dismissing their arguments is a lot easier, but all evidence points to ""they legitimately believe what they're saying."" (Or at least, they legitimately believe what their sarcasm would imply.)

If you take a troll to mean ""people who argue a lot""

---

###**Why do so many people dislike SRS?**

---

There is not a single identifying factor

There's the short list:

1. argumentation technique

2. etiquette policing

3. sensationalism

4. ad hominem

5. downvote brigades

6. non sequiturs

7. hypocrisy

8. no dissent

9. ideology

and the long list:

1. They argue a lot, a direct counterargument might be something like ""the benefits outweigh the meritocratic losses."" A sarcastic paraphrase would be something like ""translation: I am a racist and am using 'meritocracy' as a cover for being a terrible person.""

2. Their practice of swarming comments they think are bigoted, strikes most people as a kind of militant etiquette police. For example, most people would object to use of the word ""bitch"" because it is a rude swear word. SRS would too, but because it's a ""gendered slur"", and they regard it in a category similar to, but lesser than, racial slurs. By contrast, while a normal person would find it a rude swear word in line with ""bitch."" [This thread is an elaboration on that kind of disconnect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/187v5w/srs_offensive_vs_normal_person_offensive_the/)

3. They can be sensational about the things they are arguing and will frequently take their opponents out of context, the SRS poster can use that as a venue to post an *even more* exaggerated reaction, which is intended to paint you as a bad person. This emotional way of arguing strikes a hard contrast with the logical ideal that reddit professes to value.

4. Their method of attack is often ironically trait-based. In other words, so do not comment""; ""I am poor, you are not, do not comment""; ""I am black, you are not, do not comment."" Or the other way around: ""you are a man, which makes your argument invalid""; ""you are middle-class, which makes your argument invalid."" While their method of arguing is never this explicit

5. While they adamantly deny this, mock this accusation by more sarcasm. (The standard reply is something like, ""my internet points! oh no!"") There is an important caveat to this however: SRS rarely votes on the top-level comments they link to. Instead, they will keep the original comment as-is, but upvote all of their own comments and downvote any comments that oppose their own comments. This effectively creates a structure where the top-level comment remains, but everything following it is completely dominated by SRS, giving their views the most possible publicity and creating the impression that their opinion is reddit's opinion, and creates a kind of negative model: ""if you do what we disapprove of

6. In relation to #1, ""go away"", or some other irrelevant reply if you respond to them. This is despite the fact that they clearly want their views to be accepted/taken seriously. If you push them to seriously elaborate on their views, they will do so with the attitude that it's a laborious effort and they're one step away from exiting the conversation. 

7. Many people perceive there to be rampant hypocrisies on part of SRS

8. Most famously, nearly all subreddits squash dissent in one way or another. SRS is notable for however for *extensive* use of bans for even minor break from their dominant view, even on subreddits like /r/SRSDiscussion which was initially posed as a way of seriously discussing what SRS believes -- a goal which was retracted after too many people posted ""in bad faith.""

9. Finally, which hardly captures all of what they believe. Virtually everyone agrees that rape is a horrible act, for example. But SRS believes that if you have sex with someone drunk, you have raped them because they believe that person cannot consent while drunk. Most people imagine far worse when they think of the word 'rape', and this is due to their ideology's definition of the term. The foundation of their dominant view is The Patriarchy, which is an overarching societal theory that they adopt to explain oppression as they see it. Through this theory, men can be sexist to women but women cannot be sexist to men. Most people, object to their ideological quirks. (Note: this hardly covers every aspect of their ideology. For a more robust summary

---

###**But isn't SRS just satire?**

---

Do not take ""satire"" to mean ""I don't believe what I'm saying.""

The Daily Show is satire, might be pure comedy, in the sense that their comedy is derived purely from wordplay or delivery. Satire isn't. Satire contains, at the very least, some viewpoint of the satirist in the comedy itself.

[This cartoon is satire.](http://i.imgur.com/R1RtV3i.png) It is also obviously argumentative: a criticism of some perceived redefining of facts by the state.

What they are writing may be satirical

Shatner follows that particular piece of advice and takes his request to /r/ideasfortheadmins where he makes [this request that there be a way to ""turn off"" private messages to help reduce the overflow in his inbox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/)

Up to this point, William Shatner is taking an unguided safari through the Wilds of Reddit.

And that's when it happens.

/u/radii314 says: [Bill, offensive and strange just chiming in from left field from time-to-time ... there is much of interest to mine here but some bad neighborhoods too
](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bo3t4)

Shatner responds with this:

[The unsavory aspects still exist - I am apalled by some of the immature, homophobic, ethnic... etc.. posts that are just ignored here. Why are these accounts still active? While Reddit has done well in getting interest from the mainstream I just wonder if by allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage if Reddit is biting off it's own nose in taking that step to become a mainstream community.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bocrt)


[That being said

This simple message from Shatner is what SRS would *want* you to believe they are all about.  They would then be quick to take his words and run with them as fast and as hard as possible.

/u/ArchangelleDworkin is the first SRSer to respond to him by saying: [That's what I've been trying to tell the admins for years and they won't listen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bucf5)

[It took us 6 years just to get them to delete the child porn that was on the front pages

[It then gets linked over to /r/ShitRedditSays where they jerk themselves into an absolute frenzy

Some SRSers even chime in to reply to their new hero William Shatner.

/u/danaofdoom: [You know, but my whole life, William Shatner was a guy from a TV show my dad watches. But from what I've seen of you on Reddit, you seem to be a pretty cool person. 
](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bviiq)

/u/TheIdesofLight: [Thiiiiiiiiiiiis is why I love you, love love love and some more love dear god the love yessssss &lt;33333](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bux58)

And one particularly delusional SRSer /u/blueorpheus decides that hey, would love to enter the land of giant stupid image macros, odd pictures featuring dildos, and a language style so convoluted it takes 2 years on Tumblr and at least 3 gold medals from the Oppression Olympics to understand even half of it.... and he hilariously *invites William Shatner to come hang out at SRS*: [You should check out /r/shitredditsays! It's a subreddit dedicated to calling out all the racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted stuff that is highly up voted on reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8bwqg8)

Meanwhile,](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8cb06w) not their version of the shit reddit says.  This would prove to be a giant OOPSIE!

Back in SRSsucks

As the Fempire's adoration grew their celebration reached a deafening swell.  Foolishly

A day passed...and then this...

Shatner steadied his sniper rifle and let his breathing slow to match his heartbeat.  He trained the cross hairs on the space directly between the big blue bird's eyes.  Without a moment's hesitation, the Fempire went silent.

Shatner had been made aware of Shit Reddit Says

[Could I ask that you send a message over to whomever runs SRS? I would like the banner removed. I do not feel it's appropriate and I am not a member there. Thanks. MBB](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/18536m/turning_off_private_messages/c8cqsgw)

The only response from the Fempire was a defeated whimper from ArchAngelleGabrielle:

[It's really cool that Shatner's speaking up about this; I can totally understand why SRS isn't his style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/189rkc/theverge_article_summarizing_shatner_vs_reddit/c8cvoy7)


[There are lots of ways to approach making the world a better place

The fun was over.  The celebrity that had spoken about the appalling things he saw on Reddit had stopped in to ShitRedditSays and found it just as appalling.  The members of the Fempire thought they had found a hero in Bill Shatner

&gt; Dear (name redacted)

&gt; The President has asked me to respond to your letter dated December 5, obviously, do we take any institutional position on the merits of the arguments presented by this or any other group that airs its ideas on our campuses. What we can assert is our general view of free speech on our campuses. We believe a university campus is a place where difficult questions are asked and controversial discussions are conducted. It is also a place where freedom of speech, within the bounds of the law, must be respected. There are often significant challenges when speech is perceived to be offensive. On these occasions, the role of the administration is both to remind organizers of events that they must be mindful of the impact on others of the exercise of their freedom of speech, and to remind those who are offended by the content of that speech for the need for civility and respect in these discussions. **We deplore disruption of events by protesters and physical intimidation of presenters and their audiences. The vast majority of the University of Toronto community understands that freedom of expression is vital to the mission of universities and cannot be reserved for those with whom one agrees. Indeed, while recognizing the right to freedom of expression. We will continue to work with all members of our community to promote this way of approaching controversial issues and events.**

&gt; Best Regards

**second:**

Sun News Network has started covering the protest. They will be doing an interview with Warren Farrell on December 6th 8PM eastern time on ""Michael Coren's The Arena"" segment

http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/video/featured/news/868018287001/prime-time-preview-december-6/2016593084001

Sun News actually has some pretty interesting stuff

This will only make the coverage of the protest bigger.

&gt; The unsavory aspects still exist - I am apalled by some of the immature, homophobic, ethnic... etc.. posts that are just ignored here. Why are these accounts still active? While Reddit has done well in getting interest from the mainstream I just wonder if by allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage if Reddit is biting off it's own nose in taking that step to become a mainstream community.

Shatner posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/299284069592731649) which seems to corroborate that this is indeed his position on reddit.

SRS was quick to salivate over this and post Shatner as the banner of their subreddit. This is

&gt; Yeah

Shatner does not resemble a social justice warrior in any way; he does not believe even a quarter of the things SRS believes. He does not treat women badly, he would be ""cisprivileged"", and would probably ""reinforce the current power structure / the patriarchy.""

SRS has been doing this for a while. When the creepshots/jailbait drama happened, perhaps, they didn't care either way.

But William Shatner could not be farther from an SRS poster. He probably does not believe in their idea of humor  ""trivializing"" their subject matter. He probably does not believe in rape culture, or in their [flawed application of gaslighting](http://alfredmacdonald.com/2012/11/07/gaslighting-what-it-isnt/), or in their view that women can't be sexist or that minorities can't be racist. There is a gulf of difference between **finding things offensive** -- between **normal person offended** -- and SRS.

---

(side note: I find SRS's current headline about how it wants reddit to become ""mainstream"" oddly hypocritical. Mainstream is the status quo / the current power structure. Feminism's goal is to *subvert* the current power structure. So if ArchangelleDworkin wants reddit to become mainstream

---

SRS has some success because a small fraction -- say, not knowing that SRS's definitions go *far deeper* than what a normal person thinks is offensive.

They have some success because their definitions are intentionally broad for the purposes of misleading. They say ""I am against racism, so am I!"" -- They don't qualify what their definitions are, and they don't make it clear that they are using a nonstandard definition of these words.

Let's be clear: normal people **do not** have definitions of racism, and they have worked out elaborate views of social systems that are easily violated so that they can see offense as much as possible.

SRS retains these definitions as a power move: it allows them to temporarily side with normal people who don't know any better, a person in power on reddit may assume that SRS is more in-tune with what normal people find offensive and give a person sympathetic to SRS carte blanche to decide what is and is not offensive, which is (partially) what happened on AntiSRS and what happens where a social justice person entrenches themselves in a community, says that the moderators do not address social justice issues, and creates a situation where it's cognitively easier to mod the social justice person than to figure out how address social justice issues independent of consulting with that person.

There is very much Normal Person Offended, and homophobia"" means something very different to your boss, or your mother, or the average college crowd than it does to SRS. **They know** that regular people do not share their definitions, but they use them anyway hoping to mislead. This strikes me as [equivocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation), which can be a logical fallacy. It's certainly dishonest, at any rate.

Shatner may side with the 10% of what SRS finds offensive, and very few celebrities who have extended exposure to SRS would agree with them. To have him on the banner of SRS is ridiculous, because he's *far* from agreeing with even a quarter of what they believe.

We all heard this story. Remember that poor kid that played high school football and then went to prison for 5 years for a rape he didn't commit? And his accuser got $1.5 million? Well he plead guilty to the charge because he was (correctly) informed that people had been convicted with less evidence and that he should go for a plea bargain. So someone suggested that we make it harder to convict someone in order to cut down on miscarriages of justice. Well fuck people who want higher standards for conviction. They're bullies and bigots. By the way, ""why isn't the false rape accusation rate even higher than it already is?"" Well, maybe the rate is higher than we think given the low standard of evidence...

If we narrow it down to threads that are actually about Islam, not ones that simply mention it, the list is condensed even more, with no entries newer than 4 months old. ^[[21]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/search?q=islam&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) ^[[22]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/search?q=muslim&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

Let’s examine the way they address Islam in these threads.

Their most common line of attack is, this time taking the form of a tu quoque, stating that while Islam could possibly be misogynistic, other religions, specifically that Abrahamic, are also misogynistic.  ^[[23]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2i2y/islam_and_social_justice/c60wc7a)  ^[[24]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6qj2qd)  ^[[25]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6q78oy) ^[[26]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/104f7s/this_was_posted_in_srs_recently_ive_always_had/c6aujdt) . As one SRSter states “Yes, but Christianity is also. And so is Judaism. And so all are the minor Abrahamic religions, and racist


Additionally we can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/104f7s/this_was_posted_in_srs_recently_ive_always_had/c6aml1n?context=2) that suggesting that one group might commit crimes against another group is a racist idea.
Another line of attack is the conjecture that all criticism of Islam is done by racists to secretly advance their racist ideology. ^[[29]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/vm777/how_do_you_distinguish_between_islamophobia_and/c55t6s5) ^[[30]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pr2bl/islam_and_the_veil_sexism_misogyny_patriarchy/c3roplk) ^[[31]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/11wek4/is_islam_misogynistic_essay_from_slate/c6qjkkw)


We can also note that SRS seems to understand all criticism of Islam as directed at the followers of Islam, or whites, but at male/white society.

Many of us are not teenagers anymore

Whenever I read something posted by someone on SRS, so I tend to extrapolate from the behaviors of people I know who write most like them when imagining what they're like to be around.

However, ideally, IRL based on what tumblr public figures they express support for. And from these examples, I'm starting to realize that they are nothing like the people I know IRL. They are **weird.** Extremely so.

[This picture was the game-changer for me.](http://i.imgur.com/N9l1V.jpg) I don't have a ton of facebook friends -- only around 350 -- but if I showed this to virtually anyone I know on there,"" they assumed *sexual assault* was more likely.

I can't think of a single person I know who would react that way. It would be seen as batshit insane. And I don't have a shortage of friends who think non-mainstream things: I am friends with self-proclaimed feminists, socialists, muslims, sikhs, buddhists... there's a lot of ideologies represented.

My initial reaction is to think ""I just need to expand my horizons until I find someone who thinks this way.""

But then I realized something: usually, have small and isolated social circles, and don't expose themselves to normal people as much.

Which

So I'm going to throw this out there: it's OK to call out SRS people on their social aptitude when they are doing something that is so far removed from what a normal person would think is acceptable,,False,self,t5_2uuwv,False,,True

Personally, and only, marriage, pretty much, in every way imaginable, broke me.

My wife turned into one of these ""empowered women"" who suddenly had no desire to shave her armpits and wanted to pursue a career as a burlesque dancer, caring, supportive spouse and equal partner to a self-centered, manipulative, dishonest, sweaty, overweight dancer with pit bush. Little did I know her metamorphosis brought about another disgusting physical trait

In 2011, was a happy home. Now I'm underemployed, going through foreclosure, bankruptcy and a divorce on top of missing out on half of my daughter's life. I'm going to be saddled with child support that, while greatly reduced over what she would've been granted two years ago, will still put a dent in my wallet every month, and will most likely be spent on more plus-sized bustiers

&gt; First thing get a divorce lawyer and work out custody. Immediately. One of the posters claimed you shouldn't go for custody. This is wrong. Using your child in such a way speaks volumes about her as a person. This is not the type of person that should be raising children. (This is to takes pettiness to a whole new level. Chances are she got on the phone and laughed about it.) In some states this is child abuse. 

&gt; As for not moving out

&gt; Most importantly, consider her or what she wants as you proceed. Do not think you have to be chivalrous. Fuck that bitch.** Once she figures out you plan to fight, she will try to manipulate you. Don't let her. Take her to court and if you can, crush her like the vermin this story makes her out to be. 

&gt; Do not go out looking for rebound sex. Take your time

&gt; Move on. Use this as a learning experience and let that bitch kick rocks.

The encounter:

&gt; Anyway, let's just stop."" but the words wouldn't come out and for some reason I felt conflicted and didn't want to keep going..but also did not want to stop. I sort of remember mumbling and shrugging, like ""that's fine."" It makes no sense. I said, ""Let's just cuddle for now.""

&gt; So we did but then it escalated again, ugh). We ended up going to a different room and I gave him a blowjob and he gave me oral as well. As I've said, I remember being halfway into it, and halfway feeling sort of depressed/ashamed of what I was doing. **I communicated with him the whole time and told him what to keep doing and what to stop doing.** I just never quite felt like I was all there, though.

there was fair warning that the AMA would be taking place, and even /r/subredditdrama had a thread preemptively in place (deleted by mods later) before the AMA was even up.

a number of individuals got questions in *very* early, but another SRSers deemed it an ""[extremely moderate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/comments/18treb/post_reminding_mras_to_brigade_the_fuck_out_of/c8hxhjf)"". 

other drama quickly popped up. after a user was called out simply for being an SRSer

the [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hwxz8) for most of the day was held by an individual with a username SRS would likely jump all over if it was an SRSsucks or /r/mensrights member. as it happens

SRS - Official Fempire Response 

ArchangelleGabrielle (AAG) had a lengthy [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/18txpg/metatw_warren_farrell_noted_mens_rights_activist/) up in SRS Prime within about an hour of the start of the AMA. however

a lot of lube was needed for this level of jerk, copied and pasted straight from the ManBoobz post. but here's the catch: most of what AAGabrielle attributes to Farrell **wasn't even said by Farrell**. they were third party summaries or paraphrases of Farrell's academic work which were attributed to Farrell. a simple word count shows that out of AAG's post only 30% of the words were from actual quotes by Farrell, and Farrell claims he was actually misquoted in one of those. there is no delineation of what is quoted and what is not, with the only emphasis being parts AAG bolded for effect. 

yet again, i'm not sure which is worse), and then used as a representative sample of a 69 year old man's entire body of work. but AAG controlled the flow of information for many SRSers by A. trying to keep posters away from the AMA and B. presenting an *incredibly* biased view of Farrell which would color the views of those who did venture into the AMA.

Farrell:

Farrell:

Farrell was actually a fairly [prominent feminist leader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Feminist_Foundation) and clearly still has some sympathies in that regard. the misrepresentations of Farrell as some sort of woman hating beast are clearly off the mark.

i could go on and on with awful quotes from SRS but as it happens SRS is blocked here at work so that is all i have for now. what it comes down to is that the incest and rape apology SRS is claiming is almost entirely nonexistent. Farrell was attempting to study the delicate subjects from an unbiased academic perspective, and still am](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/c8hz8nm)"". 

when engaged in debate context is massively important, and by adding in a sense of 'guilty until proven innocent' SRS has unfairly painted a man as being an incest apologist. no person should ever be slandered as something that disgusting without definitive, unbiased, and conclusive proof of said accusations.

-------------------------------

My Soapbox -

what it all comes down to, not only as an activist but [even going so far as to take leadership roles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Farrell#Feminist_Foundation). but in the eyes of some, he slipped up by daring to critique the feminist movement for failing to address some issues that men will face. and to make matters worse, Farrell chose to shift his focus to mens issues. 

this has to be quite irritating for the more radical feminists out there. it is easy to dismiss critiques of feminism from your typical average joe misogynist. but dissent from within is quite damning

so what do they do? they try to discredit him entirely by painting him as a rape, if you scream those words often enough and loud enough you will get attention from a lot of people, true or not. (just look at the jailbait nonsense.) and of course, it is far easier to yell than it is to sit down and try to academically refute a well spoken, mild-mannered, and seemingly well educated old man.",,self,,

These situations are often explained away by SRS with ""Well that was a shitty comment and was probably going to get downvoted anyway."" which is a funny way of saying ""Reddit isn't as full of hateful people as we'd like for you to believe.""

However

It started with this comment in Advice Animals:

&gt;[You're a dumbass. My ex spends the child support money on her cell phone, it's still slavery and it's still unfair. You fuck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1fc5by/just_realized_this_about_my_exwife/ca91oax?context=3)

Now at the time it was linked it was at a +19 and at the time of this writing it is at a +14.  Not much of a change it seems.  However

Meanwhile, makes an attempt to defend himself and predictably gets banned.  But not before SRSer /u/second_child_of_BRD has a go at him with this comment:

This then prompts /u/cliff_hangar to send a nasty PM to /u/second_child_of_BRD who decides it is worthy of a posting in /r/SRSMailBag.  It is this posting and the screenshot where we see the evidence of an SRSer who has touched the poop.

1372217387.0,1h32ma,Harassing PMs sent from known SRSers and the Admins do nothing. (Proof inside),ArchangelleDwoorkin,113,28,53,"Earlier today I think this posting got me banned from /r/SRSSucks but I've obviously worked things out with our mods and I've been given the OK to post it again.  

You'll notice that Ides refers to me as Puck.  I'm not and I've done everything to prove that to the mods.  If you look back in Ides' post history you'll see that she's accused about 10 different people of being Puck in the last two months.  She's a little obsessed. When she started  doing it to me I asked for proof. She couldn't provide it

When I first posted this an admin did reply to the thread.  All he did was accuse me of ""ban evasion.""  Again

Here's the text from the original thread:

&gt;In the past 24 hours I have received harassing PMs from two different members of SRS.  
&gt;
&gt;The first:
&gt;
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/9FDJqWr.png
&gt;
&gt;is from /u/TheRaggedQueen.  A SRSer that I have never heard of and as far as I know I've never posted in or about a thread involving that users.
&gt;
&gt;The second:
&gt;
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/OKQUpTv.png
&gt;
&gt;is from /u/theidesoflight.  In that PM she attempts to claim that I am Puck (who has been shadowbanned).  I'm not and I ask her to provide proof or shut the fuck up.  She then calls me a ""bitch"" and a ""spineless piece of shit.""
&gt;
&gt;As you can see here I've taken the liberty of contacting the admins about Ides:  http://i.imgur.com/8Ir1kTC.png
&gt;
&gt;The only real interaction I've had with /u/theidesoflight is to firmly but politely ask her to address the fact that as a mod of /r/blackladies she called for racially motivated violence.  I've also asked her to provide proof if she's going to continue to insist that I'm someone I'm not.  
&gt;
&gt;Ides has dodged both questions.
&gt;
&gt;You'll also notice that seemingly the only reason /u/theidesoflight PM'd me was to get a response from me so she could block PMs and then harass me.  The fact that she had to PM me at all is proof that I have never sent her a PM (if I had she could have used it to block me).
&gt;
&gt;Obviously I've gotten under Ides' skin but that's not the real issue here.  The real issue is that known SRSers are sending harassing PMs and the admins don't seem to care.  Meanwhile it seems that some members of /r/srssucks were banned Sunday night for sending harassing PMs.
&gt;
&gt;To be clear

Let's get behind this and force the admins into action.  Remember they banned members of SRSSucks for sending ""harassing PMs"" but no one has seen those PMs.  I'm posting verified proof of harassment.

**Nobody should *want* to be a circlejerk**   
This is the biggest thing. Rule X. The subreddit seemed to have missed the memo we all got that you don't *want* to be a circlejerk. Think about it; it's seriously one of the worst insults you can possibly gain as a subreddit. It's why atheists hate r/atheism

But SRS seems to think labeling yourself INTENTINALLY a circlejerk is somehow wrapping an invulnerability cloak around what you say. It's like if some guy comes up and hits you in the stomach and say ""no, even if its what you're trying for. 

(the one counter-example is r/circlejerk, is that circlejerks suck)

**Satire =/= sarcasm =/= hyperbole**  
None of these words are the same. While BRDs tend to hit sarcasm pretty frequently and hyperbole quite hard, you almost become worried you've read it wrong and it is an honest call to eat babies. It mimics something by pretending to be sincere, and exposing the absurdity that is inherently in it. Sarcasm functions by being as insincere as possible as a point. And hyperbole is the stupidest thing in the whole universe, so it's mostly employed by people 15 and under.

I think I'll break this up for now. Obviously, and lets people pretend as if it were just a quirky trait of the subreddit. And pretending everything you say is satire lets you always double back on your words and hide under the guise of comedic tools you don't actually understand. It lets you fall back to ""what? It was just a joke!"" while still feeding the actual feelings you have that *do* agree with what you're saying.

Really is this that hard?  Do I even need to explain this?  Why would they even think that people make purely __sexual__ decisions on what the other person's ineffable _internal mental state_ concerning their gender?

And then the next question that ought to be asked is: If biology ought not to be important in these sexual decisions, because it involves __two people with two sexual preferences__), but concerns from the opposite person about biology are literally Hitler?

I am a straight man.  When I have no-strings-attached sex, which last I checked can't be simulated.  You going to be assholes and shame these people too?  Why should this be different for straight men?  What if they're not after surgically produced imperfect vaginal simulations?  

Maybe this will change when they can make genetalia biologically _identical_, what if a biological man wants to take things seriously, with the eventual expectation of a child, considering 99% of straight men will eventually want this?  What then?  In this perfect-genetalia-replication hypothetical, the fact that you've mimicked biology so closely __will eventually lead to you needing to disclose__.

__There is no choice-space for me (and other straight guys) that involves biological men.__  That isn't bigotry (for me at least), and I'm fine with other people's preferences.  This is _my_ __sexual__ preference, and fuck each and every one of you that would shame me for that, and insisting that I don't really know (or shouldn't) want what I want.

Shaming people into sexual preference (psychological coercion) is probably the lowest of the low.  This isn't just my belief

[What SRSters believe part 3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1dsxwy/what_srsters_believe_part_3_it_is_bigoted_to_not/)

I'd been collecting potential posts for awhile now, they will say that a man complaining about being treated as a pedophile for innocuous interactions with kids is shitthatneverhappened.txt and then turn around and start calling men pedophiles for no damn reason at all. [Here is a real life example of that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fmca1/picture_of_a_young_girl_in_a_bathing_suit_shes/) You see, the girl was being very simple. She is ""not going to college"" because she's stupid. Because they literally can't stop thinking about children fucking, the SRSters chose to interpret this insult as sexual attraction. Somehow. It's pretty blatant that SRSters engage in the behavior that they insist never occurs. Sometimes I articulate this baffling behavior with a sardonic verse. ""Misandry don't real,"" cried the group dedicated to hating men.

__________________________________________________________

There's this interesting and popular complaint amongst SRSters. It's that men feel as though they should have the right to defend themselves against women. Almost always there's a comment inside about how ""reddit will go to any lengths to justify beating women."" The only problem is that those lengths, according to SRS, men sometimes mention that they will hit a woman who attacks them or that they wish that it were socially acceptable to hit a woman who attacks them. In self defense. I have a few examples of this.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9412/11382

The top comments exemplify what I was describing above. 

&gt;[Does anyone else think it's really strange that Redditors advocate violence so freely? I feel like half of Reddit is existing in this hypothetical bubble of misandry where all women are evil and need to be taught a lesson. Like. This is a whole thread about how men should be able to hit women back


.
&gt;[""I despise all women for thinking something that literally none of them think.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/ca2x88i)

Yes. This is exactly what the redditor was trying to say. He literally despises all women. For a thing that literally none of them think. Except for every SRSter

&gt;[""I delight in the thought of getting to hit someone who doesn't look like they can kick my ass in rebuttal.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1er54q/anyone_who_hits_a_person_deserves_and_should/ca307tj)

&gt;Sequence of events for these situations:

&gt;1. Man sexually assaults woman in a bar or club

&gt;1. Woman tells him to back off.

&gt;1. Man sexually assaults woman again

&gt;1. Woman slaps man.

&gt;1. Man punches woman. 

&gt;1. Man brags on Internet how he'll hit anyone who hits him first.

☑ Redditors trying to justify hitting women just because.

☑ Minsandry don't real (I mean

☑ Accusing men of something whilst complaining about them complaining about the thing they're being accused of.

In sum
_______________________________

Got another few. Here's one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fh75b/in_response_to_a_question_asking_which_taboo/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9415/11383

So the question was about what taboo redditors would like to be lifted. The user's response was that he didn't think it should be taboo for a man to hit a woman in self defense.

Second comment.

&gt;[As we've seen a lot lately

&gt;Basically he's asking for the taboo of violence against women to be lifted.

It was pretty obvious by the comment... because it said so... that HE WAS ASKING FOR THE TABOO OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ***DEFEND YOURSELF FROM A WOMAN*** to be lifted.

From the top comment in that one:

&gt;[Not Taboo: How come when I go to a playground with my daughter people automatically assume that I'm a creepy-ephebophiledelphian? That's unfair!!!1!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fh75b/in_response_to_a_question_asking_which_taboo/caaafso)

Cool. Tossed in one of those things that don't happen that happen even though it was entirely irrelevant.

Next.

_______________

Here's an EFFORT post about men not being able to defend themselves against women. Kind of similar to the one at the top of this post that was already linked here in SRSs.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fgdmc/effortful_poop_scoop_tm_from_i_watched_this/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/8871/11384

The most fascinating aspect of this post is the spawning image macro that was used in the SRS submission title. ""'I watched this happen at the grocery store today. A woman attacked a man with a knife because he took the last case of coke. He knocked her out in self-defense.' on r/adviceanimals - YAY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMAN!!!! FUCK THE MATRIARCHY!!""

It is bigoted for a man to defend himself against a person who is ***literally*** trying to murder him if the attempting murderer is a woman.

Inside this effort is a bunch of terribly bigoted things that redditors have said. Including how men and women are treated differently if they accuse someone of rape. 

Here's that comment about how redditors are trying to justify hitting women.

&gt; [""A woman committed a crime?! Better circlejerk about beating women."" --Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fgdmc/effortful_poop_scoop_tm_from_i_watched_this/caa1zmy)

""A woman is trying to murder me? Better circlejerk about not letting her murder me.""

_____________

Guess what. It's also bigoted for men to defend themselves against *sexual* assault (perpetrated by a woman). 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/

http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/9419/11385

The sinful quote is this:

&gt;[So the next time a dame grabs my dick in a bar can I haymaker her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fn9q0/just_a_quick_little_kiss_please/cac1nth)

It was in reference to [this gif.](http://i.imgur.com/CqxcU9G.gif) This guy asks a random girl if he can have a kiss and leans in a little (obviously not all the way to her

The comments in the SRS thread reflect some of those themes I keep mentioning. 

[shitthatneverhappens](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/cac50nr)

[Don't try to justify hitting women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1fnz3o/so_the_next_time_a_dame_grabs_my_dick_in_a_bar/caca9qd)

I think I might be about halfway done here. I hope.

______

I think this one would have made more sense if this were the first one... So this is SRS worthy simply because it involves men talking about the various difficulties that men face in society. Usually by people who make negative assumption of men (sound like anyone you know?). 

Oh shit, I wish I screenshotted or used a snapshot or something. Let that be a lesson to all of us. Mostly me.

&gt; *This is Fuck You Week

&gt; Fuck you, obsessively anti-woman horseshit, to the point where it's become difficult for any rational, compassionate person to trust a man who claims he's been screwed over in family court or abused by a female partner, even if he has.

&gt; That's right—I fully understand that those things happen. I fully believe that men in those situations deserve help, especially if it's a woman who's terrorizing them. I know those same suffocating standards also encourage men to stifle strong feelings and any nurturing tendencies, which deprives them of the right to experience the full range of human emotions without shame. That completely fucking sucks! You know how I know all that, and why I think it sucks?

&gt; BECAUSE I'M A FEMINIST.

(oh god I am so moved by the individualism. so poetic. such a revolutionary underdog. this is clearly someone who is on the right side of history and not at all someone who dramatically and ostentatiously wears ideological labels like fashion brands)

&gt; That's the thing, involved fathers, justice for all, dismantling bullshit gender roles, and helping folks leave dangerous relationships. We would be the natural allies of MRAs, if MRAs were sincerely committed to the causes with which they claim to be chiefly concerned. But no, today's MRAs—unlike the 1970s movement that earnestly sought to free men, from the constraints of gender stereotypes

&gt; So fuck you, and trying to make it all about you. Fuck you for derailing threads about the victims of Marc Lépine, a man who screamed about his hatred for feminists as he murdered fourteen women and injured many others, because you also hate feminists and want a fucking cookie for not killing anyone. Fuck you for making rape and death threats against young women who dared to protest a speaking engagement by a man who thinks little girls would enjoy being raped by their fathers if it weren't for society telling them it's dirty. Fuck you for whining about how unfair it is that women might wonder if you're a rapist when you approach them out of nowhere, while completely ignoring how unfair it is that women feel the need to be on guard all the time in public. Or that if we relax and behave normally—drinking, dancing, dressing however we want—you will be the first motherfuckers in line to blame us for getting ourselves raped.

&gt; Fuck some of you for being so contemptuous of women, or that we get into perfectly even fights with our hardworking, loving husbands, then call the cops and have them arrested because we're spiteful bitches. Fuck you for blaming women, feminists, the legal system, and men who aren't misogynistic assholes for your own inability to relate to other human beings in appropriate ways.

&gt; Fuck you for pretending your primary goal as a ""movement"" is anything other than control of women's lives and bodies. Fuck you for being so delusional about how women behave in the real world, that facing consequences for hitting your child is basically the same as being a Jewish person in Nazi Germany.

&gt; Fuck you for trying to make ""misandry"" happen. Your feminist enemies don't hate men; we only hate men who proudly stand up for the rights of abusers

&gt; Fuck you for starting every sentence with ""fuck you."" You are not the Martin Luther King of women giving a historical speech to the people on the stage of a massive civil rights movement. I know you learned in public speaking or rhetoric or whatever that this kind of rhetoric is effective
 
(btw

&gt; Fortunately, most men don't beat, rape, or resent caring for their own children, and thus have no need for the kind of support and ""activism"" you specialize in. The ""work"" you do guarantees you'll continue to attract entitled shitbags who hate women, while driving away decent people who thought you might have something interesting to say—right up until they realized what you're really about.

I like being able to speak my mind. I hate having my thoughts policed.

I don't mind the members of SRS, freedom of speech exists. Freedom from hurt feelings, on the other hand, is a myth. Their myth.

1349705572.0,114z17,[FAQ] SRS_Invasion_Bot - Post-Apocalypse Edition,,109,35,29,"    1. What is SRS

SRS is full of normal people, all white people hark for the days of slavery, and reddit exists for the sole purpose of the white male majority to oppress, well, everybody.

But that isn't the reason why the bot exists. Like all visionaries througout history, and the world will be full of rainbows, unicorns and all possible flavours of cupcakes.

Like a panzer division in 1939, and were it not for the link would have no interest in.

This bot seeks to out these people for who they are.

    2. I'm not an SRSer

It means that you are showing up on the nosrs.tk list due to making a post in SRS in the last 40 days

Message me with your best SRS insult if you would like your name removed.

    3. What does Invader Score and Fempire Loyalty mean?

The Invader Score is an all time count of the number of times that user has been caught invading. This is an indicator of how strong a hit the bot has.

Fempire Loyalty is a sigmoid filtered count of the frequency of SRSisms that SRSer uses. It is mostly for fun.

    4. I hate you. You don't have a life

You would be surprised how little work it is. This bot is much more efficient at annoying SRSers than I would be. That leaves me more time to oppress minorities and promote a rape-culture on reddit,False,self,t5_2uuwv,False,,,t3_114z17

So I wait. And wait. No response. The submission still visible. I wait some more.

I got tired of waiting and decided to send the admins a message, saying he removed it, followed by a PM from an admin, letting me know it had been removed. I'm guessing the dox would still be there had I not involved the admins.

An SRSer linked to dox and the Archangelles allowed it to remain for three hours. My theory is that they allowed the dox to remain because it involved someone they recently banned.

A post in SRSDiscussion

&gt; [Painting men-only clubs as the equivalent to women-only spaces is pulling a false equivalence. Women

Later the post was reapproved after the their doctrine was added by the OP.

So, them being a ""sociological minority"".

Of course, so they invent ""sociological minority"" (**meaning**: not a minority in numbers, but in influence) to rationalize their discriminating. Ok, the term itself does make some sense, although how much of a ""sociological minority"" women think they are, if at all, remains an opinion. They like us to believe they've got it the worst

I also won't go into how much they ""need"" it compared to other people (even white men), however, is hellbent on turning that around again and *is* assigning group traits to individuals again. The least privileged of men are still more privileged than the most privileged of women in their logic, because they're men. It's a simple rule, like most bigoted rules are.

**Anyway**

If they don't have any power or influence

**If this possibility existed, etc) could simply create safe-spaces and avoid prosecution, no matter where or when.** ..but everyone knows they can't.

The only people that can create safe-spaces from other groups in society are those *that have the power*.

**Conclusion / TL;DR**: The fact that women are gaining women only spaces and men are losing them is real proof that women are in fact the group that wields the most power at this time

Men aren't allowed anymore. So

Their front page is instead filled with quotes of people's reactions to today's top story of [an extremist who executed a man in London by beheading him](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1euj7i/man_tries_to_justify_himself_to_people_filming/). It's a big story because the killer, but I was able to put the story together. Unequivocally

IAmSupernova already linked to the effort post on this so I'll leave it out of this catalog. 

First up is a decontextualized *mis*quote from a confession bear (the real purpose of this macro is to make a confession of something that you're at least moderately ashamed of). The actual quote is ""[I'm an ex-Muslim and truly want Islam to be the first religion to be eradicated.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1evs8k/something_with_islam_and_intolerance/)"" It's a lot easier for people recovering from a bad religious upbringing to see the problems with their own religion than criticize another which is probably why /u/wiro8743 opted to paraphrase a bit, this user mentions they'd like Islam to go away *first* (not *only*). The reason I think that someone would feel this way is because Christianity is relatively powerless. Islamic nations are comparably theocratic, brutalizing people for acting outside of a conservative Muslim lifestyle. This includes, but is not limited to, the execution of gays, treating women like property worth less than animals, and the punishment (often execution) of people who practice other religions. These are whole nations I'm talking about here, who have these policies institutionalized as a matter of course. These are the rules, throw acid in women's faces,"" etc. If you were a person who wanted a religion free world and you had to list the religions in order of which ones you'd like to disappear first

Deserving of its own post

&gt;Muslim nations are, because who would? So they go to other nations... and bring their shithole culture and shithole worldview with them

The user then goes on to explain that he *was* trying to vulgar in his tirade.

&gt;I wouldn't call it elegant... it was intentionally vulgar. Still

This is kind of asked an answered. Many Muslim nations are teetering on the edge of development but for the reasons I mentioned above, people. So if location A is filled with people who believe X and X is an archaic, regressive, brutal belief, and people move from location A to location B, then you now have people in location B who believe X, much to the chagrin of the original inhabitants of location B. 

Another comment, wrong one. [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/user/misandrymaggie) Shit, I'm bad at this. [Um, this one?](http://www.reddit.com/user/princess-misandry). Well, whatever. You can just read it for yourself. She's also pissed that you could look into that person's user profile and see that he posts in a [racist sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/killwhitey). 

[Here's another effort post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1eusmn/effortrworldnews_discusses_the_recent_london/) In it is a simple opposition to being opposed to murderers. 

&gt;So my instinctive reaction is that 2 Muslims have seen a Soldier wearing a Help for Heroes sign. Gone full Cultral Enrichment on him and beheaded him. The police then put them down. I really hope that my comment is completely wrong else I don't think even a UKIP vote is enough to fix these scum. [+136]

Well

&gt;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they're muslim. What a giant suprise

Okay, and marathons? Who flies planes into buildings? Not all Muslims do this, but when you hear about it happening, who do *you* assume it is and how often are you wrong?

Okay

It's pretty fucked up to see a relatively small group of Muslim people do something disagreeable and then blame all of Islam for it.

Add your own in the comments section!

I'll start:

- reddit is ""misogynist"", rapists, racists, misogynists)""

- reddit is full of (apologists for the above things)""

- rationality is a gendered concept (no

- everything to do with [cultural appropriation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation)

- any field where the gender ratios are not 50:50 has a ""woman problem"" and sexism is the reason for those ratios

- ""female"" is a demeaning word

- slurs are oppressive

- ""rape jokes trivialize rape""

- for that matter

- for that matter

- you cannot say their ideology is wrong unless you've taken gender studies as your major

- if you've taken gender studies as your major

- if you've gotten your Ph.D. in gender studies

- Men's Rights and /r/mensrights is ""hate speech""

- sex at any amount of drunkenness is rape

- all sex under the age of consent (even a 20 year old with a 16 year old) is rape

- checking someone out objectifies them

- complimenting someone's physical appearance objectifies them

- pretty much anything to do with objectification

- widespread belief in the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_social_science_model (which actually is not the standard social science model anymore

- lived experience suffices for demonstration of a phenomenon http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Lived_experience (one of the most batshit and regressive ideas SRS supports

- they are not redditors (they are)

- sensitivity = morality

- any discussion of IQ is ""bigoted"" because IQ measurements negatively affect minorities

- for that matter

- [resting your head on your girlfriend's butt is ""sexual assault""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1612vu/its_ok_to_call_srs_people_and_tumblr_feminists/)

- that SRS is about ""calling out bigotry"" (they regularly attack anyone who attacks SRS

- that SRS is only about circlejerking (it is a circlejerk

- they want a ""safe space"" (they obviously care about advancing their views in *everyone's* space when possible)

- trigger warnings are useful (for a number of reasons they're not, etc.)

- ""checking your privilege"" (which you will notice follows the same rigor someone would use when writing a literary theory essay about how bram stoker's dracula is a story of sexual repression)

- privilege theory in general (the pseudo-sociological theory that they use for it

- intersectionality (which [has a number of epistemic problems](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/15wjyo/the_epistemic_problems_with_intersectionality/))

- they are progressive (they are regressive/backward, etc.; ""progressive"" depends on what you're progressing toward)

- ""derailing"" is a thing (most derailments are just shitty versions of logical fallacies

- females can't be sexist because the patriarchy (lol?)

But perhaps the most bizarre of all is difficult to describe as a belief -- their applications of labels like ""misogynistic"", and few in the mainstream would see the things SRS labels as misogynistic or sexist as such, except in obvious and extreme situations.",,False,self,t5_2uuwv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/11qn8e/grand_list_of_wrong_things_srs_believes/

Hello
My name is [first name] and I am [a blogger at [URL]/a community organizer/awesome guy/mentally stable person/a fan of your product/etc]. I also participate on the social media website Reddit. Recently

This group of redditors, they are best at discrediting themselves by curating 'subreddits' such as ""Kill Whitey"" (http://www.reddit.com/r/killwhitey) 

This group is frequently caught misrepresenting facts to people and organizations they consider easy targets in their elaborate trolling campaigns. They have exploited mass media sympathy through lies and misdirection in order to stage these campaigns

 Currently, are breaking state and local laws by taking photographs of people in public places. This couldn't be further from the truth, as there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public places. These extremists have openly stated that their goal is to see Reddit burn to the ground.

I will continue to support [Product] as long as you advertise on Reddit

Thank You

After talking to a few mods

For SRS to reach its natural and logical conclusion

1. Cult of personality. The AAs need more veneration with their thoughts deemed always as right.
2. More true believers. SRSters with almost religious devotion to the AAs
3. More utopianism. True believers have to see SRS as what Reddit should ideally be. 
4. Real world (IRL) action. Actual events stamped by the SRS brand. Kind of like ""Occupy Wall Street"" style protests but with SRS front and center on everything.
5. Purges. Of course, punishing, and banning any members who don't kowtow the party line.

**THE PETITION**

---

To hueypriest

The recent banning of /r/cleaningupsrs has revealed that reddit policy prohibits not just vote brigades, a vote brigade; the effect SRS has on threads is well-documented, and the people who comment on those threads -- /u/butyourenice, /u/reddit_feminist, and even the subreddit's own mods -- are routinely upvoted to an amount unnatural to the linked subreddit following the linking to their own subreddit.

Since it is reddit policy to ban subreddits that vote brigade, even though SRS regulars invade threads of other subreddits in plain sight. /r/cleaningupsrs was an attempt to *restore* a subreddit's voting order; SRS's effect is to distort it. So not only is it a vote brigade in line with /r/cleaningupsrs, which was banned for being a vote brigade, it is *worse* than /r/cleaningupsrs because it disrupts activity of *other subreddits* to their own satisfaction. 

To *not* ban SRS would be a selective application of reddit policy. To selectively apply this policy would imply, and that they are being inconsistent with their application of rules in a way that favors certain subreddits over others, even if those subreddits break rules.

Because of these reasons, and banning /r/ShitRedditSays is necessary to maintain consistency.",,False,self,t5_2uuwv,False,mmcflair,

----

SRS is a group of right wing feminists (read: supremacists) who are in support of government-sponsored race/sex/gender/orientation favoritism. 

Unlike leftist and moderate feminists, and favoritism. 

They also use of the following tactics to fight anyone with differing views:

* Censorship and other ""silencing"" tactics
* Dehumanization
* Infantilization
* Other marginalization tactics
* ""Derailing"" tactics

Much of their rhetoric speaks out against the use of the above tactics... but only when it used against them. They completely support the use of these tactics against their enemies. They justify this behavior in different ways:

* By pretending to do it facetiously or sarcastically as a parody of the way society acts towards minorities.
* ""The other side does it to us

One of the most obvious problems with this explanation upon visiting their subreddits, even genuine feelings disguised as sarcasm**. By pretending to be semi-joking, they think they can get away with their terrible behavior. ""You can't call me a hypocrite, because this is a circlejerk, so it doesn't count!""  Ironically enough, one of the main reasons they are against people making race/sex jokes is because they believe those sorts of jokes are really just disguises for actual feelings. All they're really doing is describing their own motivations for calling SRS a ""circlejerk"".

Their use of the circlejerk disguise means they tend to make a joke out of their own behavior. They call themselves things like ""The Shevil Fempire"" or pretend they are obsessed with ""Dildz"" (""we love dildos because we hate penises so much

 SRS makes a large caricature of itself and hold it out in front to deflect all dissent. Sort of like an ""Inb4"" mentality crossed with a strawman argument. They would rather dismiss an argument beforehand than have to actually defend their ideas.

They totally lack self awareness. This is partially because their rhetoric is absolutely one-dimensional. Open discussion among their members (let alone from outsiders) is supressed

* If a man harms a woman
* But if a woman harms a man, when a woman uses violence, it's still the fault of men.  In other words, men are the root of all evil and women have no responsibility for their actions.



----

SRS has strong cult-like aspects:

* They use esoteric in-group language and buzzwords to quickly and unempathetically categorize all dissenters and outsiders as enemies. These include terms like Shitlord (critic)

* They are also not allowed to openly question or rationally discuss their group's rules and doctrines. Even SRSers biggest and most fervent supporters sometimes get banned for stepping out of line simply by asking calm and honest questions that might undermine the groups dogma. 

----

Rational feminists sometimes get caught in the group. But how, irrational, sometimes absurd behaviors and attitudes and decide to stay away? Well, no. Because, as mentioned earlier, they may perceive much of SRS to be sarcastic and partially joking. 

Feminists may choose to play along with absurd rules (like honest, it's actually quite serious in nature. So it's not really a circlejerk at all. In practice it acts like a political echochamber where the even the rational feminists begin to lose touch with opposing arguments and ideas. The desire to fit in with people with some-what similar beliefs causes them to fear being banned, so they adopt an attitude that discourages having normal, human discussion. 

It becomes like the [Standford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) where a pretend situation changes real behaviors and thoughts. The line between ""circlejerk"" and ""brainwashing machine"" may become increasingly blurred

----

Many feminists don't really understand how weird it gets and how much it affects them until they remove themselves from the situation. Usually against their will. These rational feminists frequently reach a fork in the road when they casually make a reasonable remark that challenges the SRS status quo and as a result they are banned. 

Invariably they will message the mods

1. ""I am so sorry I stepped out of line
    If they choose this option, but a second ban is almost certainly permanent. You only get one warning. Fear of being permanently banned or being labelled a Shitlord by fellow ""feminists"" increases the Stanford Prison Experiment effect and pretty much ensures they will lose what is left of the rational part of their feminism.

2. ""Why am I being banned? This must be some sort of mistake. All I did was say [something reasonable]""
    Oh, means you aren't fit for SRS. Feminists who undergo this process feel like they're stepping out of The Matrix. They're utterly stunned. Some feel guilty about it for a while, but eventually they start to see the SRS cult for what it is. They often join subreddits like /r/SRSsucks or /r/AntiSRS, which is full of others who help them see how disgusting SRS has always behaved, and they just couldn't see it while they were a part of it.
 
They start to see how extensively SRS uses hypocrisy, denial of reality, and all of the same derailing-, silencing-, and marginalization- tactics that they speak out against. 

----

**TL;DR - Circlejerks should ALWAYS be TOTALLY lighthearted. When a circlejerk involves serious subject matter, if a group bans free speech, stay the fuck away, it will become an echochamber. Circlejerks with serious subject matter that ALSO ban free speech will always become cult-like and they WILL contaminate your thoughts and behavior.**",,False,self,False,t3_1ge6f4

How many men here have been raped, by SJW definitions?",,77,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1k8ih7/have_sjws_really_thought_this_rape_is_what_you/

My question: How many men here have been ""raped"" by SJW standards? 

How many men have not been the sober one in a sexual encounter with a woman

We can all agree that there are _really_ fucked up things that happen to women, or a matter of consent revoked after the fact.  In _these specific cases_, these people are conditioned to perceive a lack of agency on their part, and that it was rape.

Back to my original question: __How many of us have been ""raped"" in a way that we didn't feel was rape

I have had sex I'd rather have not have had after the fact, and was one of many during my college years who _apparently_ took advantage of me.  I didn't even give ""enthusiastic consent"", or any consent really, my spinal erection reflex did what it does, as with any other 19 year old male, and my body followed, but that isn't _really_ consent

Using SRS definitions, thus I ought to have reported her to campus administration, no?  

I'm really curious as to what the case is for you men, where according to SJWs, _you were in no position to consent_.

What happens, we men are _much_ less likely to report something as rape, or domestic assault, because we're told to ""man up"", ""suck it up"", and ""stop being a pussy"", right?  Of course, because _apparently_ we men are always supposed (by the Patriarchy) to be in control

What happens if we're conditioned otherwise

How much ""rape"" is not reported by men

How many lives have we had the ability to destroy

[EDIT]

So basically

And for the sake of being really egalitarian

Maybe we could be selective, we report it as a rape, even if just to make these statistics more reflective of reality.

Remember that srsers are actively seeking out offensive posts, sexism etc. on Reddit.


Methodology and other things to take into account:

* According to ShitRedditSays they currently have 36,663 figure even more laughable, either way it doesn't change anything. I’m just using this to point out that they should have at least 366 active users which is more than enough for them to come up with a substantial amount of “bad” posts or comments. They are unable to do this. If 1% of their users found just a single comment daily that was objectionable their weekly total would be 2,562 posts. The actual figure of 181 posts over the last week makes their claims a joke. To top it off I’m even including their posts that are misleading and out of context in these figures.

* To see the number of posts over the last week I'm using the Reddit Enhancement Suite (It may work without it, it also includes comments that they found objectionable. A single post sometimes has more than one comment that they have found objectionable and they sometimes make separate post for different comments from a single thread. It’s true that there are often more comments that they talk about from the same post but it still comes out that there are about 25 or less total posts daily that they find offensive.

Anita claims that the fact that Star Fox Adventures features a male character in a leading role

See, featuring a female fox as the main character. During the development, the team was visited by Shigeru Miyamoto (the guy behind Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Star Fox and Pikmin). When he was shown what they had come up with so far, he said he was impressed

This guy had been responsible for the most successful games in history up to that point. What were they supposed to do? They altered the game to shove Fox in the lead role

The change to make Fox the protagonist wasn't due to sexism, Sony and Nintendo, and anything you could do to improve the chances of success was going to be taken.

Miyamoto understood that if the average kid walked into a store and saw a game called: ""Dinosaur Planet"" with a purple fox on the cover

So the question of why Krystal became an ""object"" (apparently the word chosen by people to describe non-playable characters or NPCs). Well, it suddenly either doubles the work, or you cut corners and do a half ass job (Sonic Unleashed, Halo 2, Resident Evil 6, and so on). But on the other hand, if you make their gameplay the same

And another thing, Krystal had been handling her business, but was still completely overwhelmed by the main bad guy. That adds a sense of danger throughout the game because the player knows that the antagonist doesn't fuck around. And it turns out, at the end, that she was blindsided by Andross, who was basically a evil, magic, considering he had the capability of destroying entire planets. 

See, it was business. Making Fox the main character, and the only one they had to worry about from a gameplay perspective gave them the best scenario for success. The unfortunate side-effect was that Krystal wasn't given a chance to really do anything until the next Star Fox game.

1) In the category of **""You think STEM is hard?! Let me school you on MY MAJOR boy""** goes to.../u/brdwombyn for her comments on  the difficulties of art [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14sjvs/if_theres_a_rise_in_stem_and_a_fall_in_the_rest/c7g3pdk)

&gt;*[Yeah

&gt;*AWESOME! THANKS!... FYI it's due in a week! There's also another one due in a few more weeks, including knowing every bit and piece of the entire skeletal and muscular systems, how they're put together, how they move, how they bear weight, and how they vary greatly across EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVER. Also, you'll need to have a really fantastic understanding of gravity and how it affects the human body in a multitude of ways.*

&gt;*You also know a lot about the science behind light and color

&gt;*Please to be making sure that you understand the chemistry of all the materials used as well. It's oil. It doesn't dry. It cures. Putting the painting by a fan won't speed things up. Also, so sorry about those 20-hour days you'll be spending working on them.
Just so you know, so don't get too attached to anything you do. It can be discouraging, but I'm sure that your logical STEM brain won't really have to worry about that, so I don't know why I bothered to mention it in the first place.*

&gt;*I know that's kind of a lot to throw at you, I know that your superior STEM manbrain can handle it.*

&gt;*...Wait

&gt;*lol, because art is a HUGE part of our culture, our lives, and our history. There were paintings before there was science, technology, engineering and math, you know.*

/u/brdwombyn also won the awards for **""Loosest use of the word 'chemistry'""**

Her other post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/14sjvs/if_theres_a_rise_in_stem_and_a_fall_in_the_rest/c7g4chn): 

&gt;*Yeah, because it really was a whole lot easier.*

&gt;*I think painting is the most frustrating thing I've ever done, or via re-triggering some pretty nasty mental illnesses...Or, you know, the drinking that I feel driven to because all the art I do is SO HEAVY and I just can't hold that all in my body without numbing it...Yeah, probably the drinking...but I digress).*

&gt;*I definitely would be living a much cushier and comfier life if I were still in STEM, physically exhausting or as unhealthy as art is for me.*

&gt;*But damn it. I feel like I'm contributing to the story of humanity as an artist. And that's a lot more valuable than what many STEM majors can claim.*

This second comment won the award for **""Best dissociation with reality""**.


2) Our second category is **""Most bitter""** and it's a very competitive one this year. Let's see the nominees...

/u/UnicornBoogers for her comment found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c6795im):

&gt;*As someone with a law degree

We would like to remind our audience that these are all comments in a post about how STEM majors are arrogant assholes.

And the anti-STEMY goes to......./u/Redkiteflying ! 

We chose this winner because she seems to be particularly bitter

On an post about SRS's lack of sense of humor [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/12eegt/so_a_white_male_posted_something_without_checking/c6udbmu)

So congrats to /u/Redkiteflying for the antiSTEMy! And congrats to the nominees as well

3) And the next category is **""Most likely to have dropped out of a STEM major because it was too hard""** goes to.... /u/typon for her post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/nbk7k/women_dont_want_to_be_engineers_thats_why_there/c37vfv6):

&gt;*The reason there aren't more women in Engineering is simple: most engineers are self-absorbed socially awkward misogynistic idiots*

Ooh..you can almost smell the hatred off her. It's as if she is personally offended by STEM majors. Congrats on the award typon and with such hate

4) Our next category is **""Best armchair psychology attempt about STEM majors while using as many words as possible to say nothing""** goes to..../u/Philip_Stained_Glass for her analysis on the problem with STEMMIES found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/y1tu4/hey_srs_whats_up_with_all_the_stem_hate/c5rpkbp)

&gt;*There's one major reason that STEM needs to be brought down a few notches. A lot of STEMers think they have a monopoly on knowledge, intuitive certainty that they are always right about anything, because, like, science.*

&gt;*So when a half-century of incredibly intelligent, threatens some STEM dude's sense of his central place in the world--and he figures out it comes from a discourse other than empiricism--he lazily spouts some lazy bullshit about ""equalism."" Not only lazy but also neither logical nor rational. I'm pretty sure the feminist movement has, in fact, used logic (if not Frege and Russel's psuedo-mathematical ""logic"") to determine why it's necessary to be a feminist and not an equalist. They weren't just wandering around with divining rods while they had PMS-induced girl-visions or something. So shut the fuck up.*

&gt;*Basically, un-nuanced ideas from the French Enlightenment, pretend that no ideas happened in the West since then, and then restate those ideas in the most primitive and shallow ways.
I.e.

This comment was also nominated for **""Post with the most unnecessary commas and quotations""** and **""Post that makes no sense

5) Our final category is **""Poster most seething with rage""**.

And the antiSTEMY goes to....[deleted] for this post about the vile STEMMERS [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/zrxla/in_response_to_a_music_major_as_someone_with_a/c67bbev)

&gt;*The reason these people hate the arts is the same reason they are disgusting human beings

This poster also won an award for **""Most likely to have an aneurysm in the near future""**

1370931739.0,1g3suu,SRS really is slipping if they have to link to fathers who tease about how difficult it is to deal with their daughters growing up.,IAmSupernova,72,12,27,"These types of comments are so common from fathers who struggle with that time in their daughter's life when they start to date and explore their sexuality.  These comments aren't meant to take anything away from the sexuality of women.  These comment are FATHERS who don't want to let go of the innocence

Yet somehow SRS found this offensive.  Which I guess makes sense if you think about SRS style feminism as meaning:  white people = bad

The submissions in question are 2 recent posts where SRS attacked some fathers who made a joke about how they are handling their daughters growing up.  The same type of joke that literally every father makes.  Jokes that aren't designed to take away from their daughters going from girls to women

So [this image]( http://www.livememe.com/ogjx9oh.jpg) was linked to /r/AdviceAnimals.  You'd think SRS would have a problem with the attire for an 8th graders prom sexualizing a child.  But no

The comments in that meme are a lot of fathers talking about what they will allow their daughter to wear.  I mean

Not where SRS is concerned.  Somehow, why does SRS have a problem with children not dressing modestly?  I don't know.)

[I may not be a mennonite

[SRS submission]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1g3ctr/on_female_clothing_options_i_may_not_be_a/)

So there you have it.  As far as SRS is concerned, you're suddenly oppressing YOUR 8TH GRADER DAUGHTER'S SEXUALITY.

As if that wasn't bad enough, GENDER ROLES ANYONE?) finds thongs and he's not sure if they are his wife's or his daughter's.  The post in question:

[I'm so glad I have sons...]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1g1jad/16_years_later_edition_everytime_i_do_laundry_as/cafx9tt) however repeated about 10 times. [SRS submission]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1g1w2f/on_girls_wearing_thongs_im_so_glad_i_have_sonsim/)

They are so hard up on material that they are linking to a dude who is glad he doesn't have to face his daughter's growing up because he has *gasp* SONS!  HE BROUGHT MORE MEN INTO THIS WORLD!

I'm bipolar. 

I'm called crazy, worthless, lazy, unreliable, waste of life, psycho, etc etc. *But I don't know what it's like to be marginalized.*

It can be incredibly difficult to hold down a job. I've managed over the past couple years if not for a boss that understands and a job that isn't too demanding. But I'm aiming for a career

The NRA just recently stated that I should be put on a national registry

No, its direct effects on my social life and its after effects on my finances. I've never had to battle for my life through an episode of severe depression, existing in a breathing purgatory, not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I've never had to deal with an episode of psychosis, where my generally rational brain cannot form a rational conclusion to act on and my behavioral pieces like to fuck with me.

Worst of all, *I can't know adversity.*

------

By trivializing my struggle

All of this does unimaginable damage. Because of these things, you can go a very long time not noticing, even by way of denial. Contributing to this is the stigma, in an effort to avoid being labeled 'one of those crazies.' 

I've been accused offhand as a liar, gender and sexuality; which is absolutely, by its very definition, an assertion birthed out of racism, sexism, bigotry and explicit ignorance.

Let's set up all the data first: 

In this thread srs decides that all women who wear yoga pants do it to be comfortable and that a woman who disagrees is a special snowflake. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1b10iv/woman_says_that_women_who_wear_yoga_pants_to_work/

http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1b17l1/effort_post_redditors_feel_violated_by_swedish/


Now that the examples are given let's examine the reactions. 

1. A picture of a woman in yoga pants is taken without her consent. Srs says this is wrong
2. A woman says that she wears yoga pants so that men will look at her ass. Srs says that she does not speak for all women. She is a special snowflake and that her opinion is not valid she is just one woman. They wear yoga pants to be comfortable.
3. A woman posts pictures of mens' crotches. Srs is ok with this even though the men have not consented. 
4. Men in the thread say that those men were just sitting to be comfortable. Srs says no

Analysis: Srs is ok with candid photos of men and telling them that they don't sit that way just to be comfortable. Srs is not ok with candid photos of women and telling women that they don't choose those pants just to be comfortable. IPSO FACTO IT IS MISANDRY ~QED~ ~FIN~

Some choice double standard quotes:

I got banned from SRSD in like...two posts. Basically, just being standard. White dolls are racist. White beauty symbols are inherently racist.

Now, I don't just blindly agree with every single ""anti-racist"" sentiment because that's obviously illogical. So when I saw this thread, I had something to say. Verbatim, I said:

&gt;All over the world, without being overtly racist. So why is it only a problem when whites find their own race attractive more so than others? Why does every single white male have to be entirely neutral when it comes to such a subjective matter, but it's just fine for minorities to do the same thing?

Of course, or racism at all...I was just explaining that the entire concept of ""more white sex symbols = racist"" was logically flawed and an unfair attack on every single person with a white significant other.

So of course, I just wanted to challenge some of the ideas being presented. I believe that liberally throwing the word ""racist"" around like they did is dangerous because it makes outsiders take ACTUAL racism less seriously. Even if I agree with someone, I'll still challenge their ideas if they're making bad arguments. I just wanted to explain to the mod that I believe their cause would be furthered by consistent debate and discussion instead of just echoing everyone else that agrees with you.

About a year ago, primarily relating to their absurd notions of sexism.

Just like the bullies you deal with here on Reddit, the act of even trying to object was oppressively stifling, because you were ""drowning out"" women's voices. In short: Unless you're a woman, _shut the fuck up_. If you are a woman, shut the fuck up unless you're toeing the line, lest you be bullied with the ""special snowflake"" label.

Their bullying worked.

It became more and more painful to read the site. Occasionally, desperately hoping not to be attacked or accused of sexism. Sensing weakness, as bullies do, those posters would be ripped to shreds.

A few months ago, this strategy hadn't occurred to me!  I had avoided confrontation my whole life, and there are few things more confrontational than standing up to an angry, self-righteous mob.

Nervously, I felt excited. It was an opportunity to stand up for myself and for people who I _knew_ were too timid to stand up for themselves, and nothing feels more empowering than that. Nothing.

My excitement did not predicate upon how well my posts were received; in fact, receiving +20, +30, or +40, especially when I was responding to a particularly aggressive bully to begin with.

**DISREGARD THIS

[The admins want us to take the meme down.](http://i.imgur.com/BFVRX.png) So we're forced to ban it. Sorry.

I will leave the rest of the post here for posterity but it's no longer relevant. The meme is banned

**UPDATE 2**

[Here's the full exchange with the admin from the modmail.](http://i.imgur.com/xoBtQ.png) Make of it what you will.

***

There has been even more controversy surrounding that meme now that the alleged subject of the photo - who claims to be friends with Laurelai - is posting on Reddit saying she's unhappy with the photo being passed around and she does not share any beliefs with SRSers.

First, and the other mods are concerned, that image is no worse than any other meme. All the memes featuring real people use images pulled from the internet without the knowledge of the subject of the photo. Furthermore, they don't consider whether or not the person in the photo actually believes the things the meme is about. There are [far worse memes out there to take your anger out on](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4278427/Web-trolls-put-picture-of-Downs-Syndrome-girl-on-Facebook-with-vile-caption.html) (thanks ddxxdd) if you dislike this, and anyone who takes issue with how the memes are produced should contact /r/AdviceAnimals, not us.

Second, but there's no proof of anything.

Third

So **the official position is we will not be removing those memes.** However, perhaps utilising SRS's ""Brd"" image as opposed to a real person.

2012 isn't the only time that the female electorate has done that. They also did it in [2008](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_08.html) and [1996](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_96.html). 

What about the other years? Well generally the male and female electorate agree with each other. The recent exceptions to this were the 2000 and 2004 elections where women voted by a very small margin for Gore and then again, the 2000 election was essentially decided by the Supreme Court and not by men *or* women.

'Nkosi Thandiwe shot dead 26-year-old Brittany Watts and and injured two other women in the parking deck of the Proscenium building on July 15
 His trial went to court this week.

 Thankiwe confessed that he shot the three white women after he **learned to hate white people in college.**

 The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported:

 During his testimony Wednesday
 Thandiwe suggested that his reason for even purchasing the gun he used in the shootings was to enforce beliefs he’d developed about white people during his later years as an **anthropology major** at the University of West Georgia.

“I was trying to prove a point that Europeans had colonized the world,” he said. “In terms of slavery, it was something that needed to be answered for. I was trying to spread the message of making white people mend.”


He said the night before the shooting

Nkosi Thandiwe was found guilty of murdering a woman and wounding two others in a 2011 Midtown shooting spree was sentenced to life without parole plus 65 years in prison.'

Notice the girls shot were prime SRS material - young white college chicks doing liberal arts degrees and attending a multicultural 'peace party'. This didn't stop them having their privilege checked in the most extreme way by a disadvantaged PoC that their own ideology had taught to loathe *all* white people for historical crimes.

That notwithstanding. SOMETIMES someone would have a point. But their comment is so littered with insults and degradation

Since then I've honed into the r/mensright subreddit

19 hours ago, yes?  Means we won't have to deal with an SRS thread talking about how all ?

Nope.

[This](http://redditlog.com/snapshot/15783/20605) comment, the score was +19.  Now, 6 hours after the SRS thread was posted, the score has dropped to -20 at the time of writing this.  In addition, the scores of comments critical of /u/Pupmup have gone up in karma as well.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/NqLHgP7.png) is a compilation showing the downvoting and upvoting of comments; on the left is the screenshot from SRS, on the right is my screenshot from the time of this writing.

The biggest piece of evidence isn't just the sudden swings in comment scores

[Observe](http://i.imgur.com/nMsKN7v.png), /u/Pupmup posted his comment roughly at 9:00 AM, and received a positive score up until roughly 4:20 PM, about 20 minutes after his comment was posted to SRS.  From there his score dropped to -20.

Seriously, killed, and forced to labor for hundreds of years in America? When a woman hears the word ""cunt,"" does she immediately get a flashback to the 1910s when she couldn't vote? The way I see it, ""cunt"" is ""the most offensive word in the English language"" because women made it so. It's not a charged word full of a history of oppression and hatred. It's just a rough, harsh word that starts and ends hard. I asked my best friend why she thought being called a cunt was offensive, and she said ""it just is."" The way I see it,"" and you know how much BRDs love to use the word ""fuck.""
