**Context**

I'm sure you've hear about the Supreme Court 5-4 decision to approve of strip searches for any arrest. If you haven't

Personally

[First, among other prisoners. A simple arrest is not enough.
Second, police cannot cite this case and claim to have ""permission"" notwithstanding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48dyp8)

Additionally, last year in my hometown of New York, the District Court of New York ruled that over 100,000 claimants in a class-action lawsuit were to be awarded $33 million by the City of New York for being illegally strip-searched and detained. [Link](http://nycstripsearch.com/)

Redditors, let us begin.

*Here I am, cutting through the thicket of sensationalism with a sharpened cutlass.*

&gt;Being arrested does not mean you are guilty of anything
This is one of many laws that will be applied arbitrarily whenever the police need to intimidate citizens, but they will if they need to put you in your place
&gt; &gt;[Well said. It's seems like all these new bills as of late are designed specifically/intentionally to be open to interpretation and leave way to much head room for abuse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48h37m) [+273]

Something that really bugs me about responses like this is that redditors deal with some weird dissonant dichotomy here. On one hand, all 100 federal senators, all federal 3,492 judges appointed by those 535 individuals, and the entire executive office of the President are out to get you. Depending on the situation, both can apply! 

I digress though. Here it comes

I remember laughing about how the USA was going to start loading people into trains and sending them to FEMA prison camps or how George W. Bush was going to authorize the use of the US military against American citizens thus ushering in a neo-facist empire where he is the God-King of the west.

It's easy to point out how everyone with a fucking internet connection is an economist/soothsayer/political analyst these days or laugh when one of these prophecies doesn't come true but I think there is some very interesting psychological stuff going on here. 

Reddit (or more generally the internet) is a little different from printed media. When you print a newspaper

This may seem obvious to you guys but I think this model of information transfer is really poisonous for the paranoid doomsday prophets of our community. If you declare on TV or in print that the rapture is coming next March and you're wrong

Let's get a discussion going on what this subreddit is and what we want this subreddit to be going forward. Here's my take on it:

I think we're leaning a little too much towards a ""SRSpolitics"" tone. There are a lot of threads and posts that need to be critically examined beyond the usual ultra cynical, but I don't believe that r/PanicHistory should be that place to do so. A post can be very outlandish, but it doesn't need to predict imminent disaster. I hate to point fingers at others, so I'll just choose a post from r/OccupyWallStreet:

[Vulture Capitalism doesn't care about the dignity of life. Vulture Capitalism exploits the weak to enrich the few. Stop Vulture Capitalism.](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/pxtf6/vulture_capitalism_doesnt_care_about_the_dignity/)

And the image is of an Indian child in a boat wading through a ""sea"" of garbage. While this is stupid and overly sensationalized

For an example of something I do want to see in Panic History, is to document them all and then retaliate with posts like [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ppdj8/greenwald_time_and_again_americans_support/c3r8las)

&gt;Understand what we really face. Short of violent



This may sound harsh but are you serious? Your Vote? Please. Your vote hasn't mattered in at least 30 years. And your money? That is an even bigger joke. That is unless you are the CEO of some major corporation with the means to buy the politicians. Your pittance will never be able to beat out the billions that get dumped into ""our"" ""representatives"" pockets by lobbyists for corporate America.
If you are really looking for answers then you will need to understand and internalize the following: We do not live in a functioning representative republic in any positive sense of that term. What we live in is an inverted totalitarian Kleptocracy where ""democracy"" is managed. Managed to keep you participating in their rigged system. Voting is all they want you to do. If you are participating in the political process by writing to those that don't give a crap about you or your interests and concerns and then voting for their sanctioned candidates, unless there are hard-core, fundamental changes to our political process, it never will again.
Seriously, there is only one way to have your voice heard and change things at this point. And that is from outside the system by engaging in mass civil disobedience and direct action campaigns. But that takes actual effort from the masses. Not the effort it takes to write a check or the 30 minutes it takes to vote.
