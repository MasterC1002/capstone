I usually get this leather owl coin purse brought for me when people go away on vacation: [[amazing knockup in paint of three of the purses I have found here.](http://i.imgur.com/XyyNx.jpg)]

They're made of cheap shiny leather, one from Wales, one from England and one from Sweden. Apart from the one that came from Spain which is square shaped, most are the same owl shape design and dyed in bright dyed colours. 

Urban Outfitters also used to sell them two years ago when owls got all hipster. The usual places like Ebay, with no description of where it's from, and the sellers are from different countries.

All my purses were brought from knick knacky leather/wood shops that tourist places usually have in every country

Anyone got any clue where they're from, I have no clue which country ""started"" it, so to speak.

I first thought they were Japanese as that's where I got the first present from
