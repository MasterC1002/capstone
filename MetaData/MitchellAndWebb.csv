I'm honestly depressed by series 7 and 8

""It's almost as if Quantocking is the last absolute golden episode maintaining Peep Show universe and by Quantocking II we're in some horribly deformed alternate reality. (Although the moment Mark gives terminal illness reasoning for the failed conference is perhaps the prelude over-the-top moment to this)

This also coincides with a change in director, ""Depends"" to Hans being shot in the rear with a ball bearing? It's some journey this show has taken!""

The show tries too hard with the inner dialogue now. No one gives a shit about Dobby when you turn her into such a crappy character, and Olivia left because Sophie also turned in to such a shit character (seems to be what has to happen for mark's love interests) Dobby's friends are just boring and shit.""
