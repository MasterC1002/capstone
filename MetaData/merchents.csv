The main plan is to bundle custom orders in with my orders to get wholesale prices with a very talented artist

The artist I have in mind is extremely talented and a popular glass blower on boromarket. He's often booked so the work could take as long as 2 months. His prices seem to be fair and he has two other glass blowers that can handle simpler requests.

I was just wondering how you all felt about the idea and if you had any suggestions or questions. I'm also curious about how long would be too long of a wait?

Thanks for all the support so far! Sorry about the wall of text!

TL;DR - Is there any interest in high quality custom glass orders?

Therefore, and I can build the e-commerce myself (experienced web developer).

1364868273.0,1bhiuz,A quick mod post regarding the sub,GloriousMatt,12,1,3,"Dear readers

I figure since my business is on the back burner I can objectively be a 'bad' mod.

On the sidebar this sub is described as: 
&gt; a place for ents to promote their trees-related businesses


Since it has grown most posts have steered away from the original idea of ent-run businesses to focusing on anything smoking related. While I do prefer people to choose 'local' businesses first, questions, product reviews (we'd love some product reviews!!) and anything else as related to running/interacting with a smoke related business or its products are welcome.


That said


Thank you for reading

Good night all

Matt

PM ME!!! If you just leave a comment chances are I won't remember to make your bracelet! 

PM me what color you want (natural tan, blue, or red. Or and combination of the two colors) Then, what style knot you would like, square knot, twist, or braid. If you would like beads in your bracelet, I have round wooden beads, round natural stones... If you want a certain type of bead chances are I can get it. You can order it without beads too. 

And last but not least

I hope to hear from my fellow Ents soon! Since I'm new here

Shipping is $3.00
I accept **PAYPAL!!**

1- I'm no rolling expert
2- I don't like to smoke unfiltered tobacco with trees
3- I don't want to spend money on special wrappers and stuff

Maybe a bong is better indicated
