1364860485.0,1bh3sb,Austin Carlile is not who you all think he is. Wake up.,,173,68,243,"Upon hearing the news that Austin Carlile was recently arrested for felonious assault

I'm aware that it's a lot of ""He said, honest and peaceful person ever. This has to be a lie"". 

You may all think that Austin is that kind of person, he is not nearly the man that he's been showed in the public light. Rockstars have allegations made against them all the time. Why aren't we believing the ones that are made against Austin? The allegations made against Dhavie Vanity of Blood on the Dance floor being a rapist, we all believe. Why? Because Blood on the Dance floor is a musical abomination, and are hated almost universally outside of their cult fan group. Whereas a band such as Of Mice and Men, who have a much larger fanbase, couldn't possibly be headed by such a hateful person. 

I'd like to go through just a few of the allegations (proven and unproven) made against Austin Carlile:

1. Kicked out of Attack Attack (Speculated for Alcohol Abuse and being an all around douchebag)
2. Kick out of Mice and Men (I don't even need to get into why
3. Has threatened to murder the family of Landon Tewers (for all of those who have wondered why Landon and Austin hate eachother
4. Stole music from Nick Conway of View from an Airplane: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnn6Y1l91iw
5. Cheated on his wife
6. Felonious assault.

I can give someone the benefit of the doubt once

I know you all LOVE Austin Carlile on this subreddit, you need to acknowledge the following:

Austin Carlile gets away with what he does because he is talented and attractive.
Austin Carlile is painted as a saint because that's what Rise Records and Of Mice and Men WANT you to think.
The fact that Austin's mother has died is tragic
The fact that Austin was bullied also does not excuse the fact that he's a shitty person.

The one thing that always plagued me with this subreddit is that it's almost exclusively music. Now don't get me wrong, and news posts about our beloved scene. Not only will it add a lot more content, which is frankly void at the moment, but it also grants the opportunity for each of us to find more new music, as a single youtube video really is not an appealing way to do so.

2. Equal Vision records moved the band to its active roster (1st column

A facebook friend's tour story....",7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/PostHardcore/comments/16mtvz/never_book_the_monsters_ive_met_a_facebook/,"So basically, this guy I know filled in on bass for this band from the UP of Michigan for a tour they were going on. Halfway through, he hopped a bus home

Okay
I am going to tell you about my experience on the road with one of the most downright ungrateful and selfish person I have ever met. You can take it or leave it
I was asked a couple months ago to be fill in guitar player for the Marquette, showed a darker, uglier side that I have never seen from anyone. With constant put downs of every person we have come in contact with on this trip. Weather it be the homeless person sitting on the corner, or the promoter of a show inside of their own home.. Nobody was safe from the onslaught of insults and criticism. It only took 5 days into tour for me to confront him about a personal attack after he said (behind my back) ""I wish he would shut up and play bass like he is supposed to"".. I confronted him about it and he told me the stress of the road got the best of him. I forgave him an continued the tour. After that talk he however did not stop the constant smack talking of fellow tour mates ""Apparitions"" and everyone else he came in contact with. Aside from the smack talk, the control over the band from him was nothing short of a dictatorship. Pulling into a wal Mart parking lot became something we dreaded because although the seat in the back of the van folded into a bed, he would only allow him and his girlfriend to sleep on it, even though there was enough room for at least 1 more person. This meant sleeping in sitting positions for hours at a time, while he slept in the back and wouldn't even offer to take turns or TRY to work things out with the bed. His reasons were because of his girlfriend being with, fixating mainly on the image of the band
We played a show in West Virginia and had a food guarantee of pizza for us. We showed up late to the show and all of our food was already eaten, he was across the street getting drunk at a bar. So naturally, as pizzas tend to do, the pizza disappeared pretty fast. After he returned he saw no pizza was left and threw a diva like fit that would embarrass even a 4 year old.. Somehow he was talked down and was invited back to the sound guys house to stay with him and the promoter of the show. Keep in mind this sound guy did the entire show absolutely free, so that the bands could get the money they needed. The entire way all we heard was cut down after cut down about the promoter of the show, at one point heard him say ""this guy didn't even do anything, I just don't fucking like him"". Fast forward an hour, which turns out to be a trailer home in the middle of a backwoods area. Right off the bat the comments of ""what a shit hole"" and ""look at this dump"" came spewing out of his mouth. We went in to find a very friendly guy waiting, he made it very clear to everyone that this home was not good enough for him. At one point
This man was verbally attacked by the pair, and the mans family. I couldn't sit and bite my cheek any longer. I stood up and stopped it right there. Telling the vocalist he is the most ungrateful thing I have ever seen, and questioned how he could possibly de humanize this man in his own home. He did not apologize, he stood his ground and tried to defend what he was doing. After being confronted by a younger brother of the family about how he talked to his family, his first reaction was not to apologize, but to try to fight the 20 year old in his home. It ended with the band going to wal mart, I however stayed behind. The following morning I rode to New York with Apparitions. After TMIM showed up I called them into the van to talk to them and tell them I would not be continuing the tour with them. Expecting to hear apologies or excuses blamed on alcohol, we will have so many bigger better things happen to us

The vocalist of this band is nothing short of a Ronnie Radke wannabe and does not deserve to be associated with the music industry. I encourage every one of you to please share this story and make this as viral as you can, and Bryce reflect on the rest of the band. The other 2 are very good people who appreciate everything. Bullying is not tolerated from anyone, and I hope you would do the same thing and stand up against such bullying. Please share this and feel free to ask any questions you may have. 

I will finish this with a screen shot of a post he made about the man we stayed with after the ordeal was over.

Hi.
I love post-hardcore, this is not an insult, I am simply saying that I am not into it.

So, and thats why I think we need to split off. There are clearly less of us uninterested in synth-n-chug than the opposite, and I would love to see a sub dedicated to the less generic bands that fall under this huge genre, so we can have dedicated content and (hopefully) more of it. I, for one, am discouraged about posting anything related to the bands I'm interested in here, because it's usually drowned in youtube links of rise records bands.

So

Anyway, Solace, caught fire in December of last year. 
Our scene really depends on the Solace team. Without them

I know this is a really out of place post, but the Solace team has started an [Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-rebuild-solace?c=home) to try to raise funds for a new building.

If you guys cant, it will be greatly appreciated by everyone in the area.

Hey Guys.

Last year we did an AOTY competition

The vote will be fairly simple where y'all get to pick your three favorite albums, and third one. I'll collect all of the points and aggregate them. (You don't have to pick three if you don't want!)

 ***MESSAGE ME*** your ballot - Please don't comment on this thread!

I'm fairly smart so as long as you make your message remotely clear I'll be able to count it

My ballot

1. Make Do and Mend - Everything You Ever Loved
2. The Amity Affliction - Chasing Ghosts
3. Vales - Clarity

(So if you're still confused - MDAM will get 3 points, whoever gets the most points wins.)

While we don't want to be stepping on anyone's toes to too great of an extent, etc. posts that we get here need to come to an end. There is of course some crossover between these genres, but at the end of the day, /r/metalcore and /r/deathcore exist for a reason, along with /r/poppunkers, /r/easycore, and literally hundreds of other genre-specific music subreddits.

If y'all can please keep this in mind when posting stuff here, we've been removing posts here and there if they're flagrantly outside of the genre, and we'll be continuing to do that going forward.

Thanks for your help in making /r/posthardcore as awesome as it can be.

*****
**Brief History and Context**

Senses Fail was formed in 2002 in Ridgewood, James Gill (bassist who was quickly replaced by Mike Glita), and Garrett Zablocki (guitarist). Over the years, the band has gone through several member changes, resulting in Nielsen and Trapp being the only remaining founding members. Along with changes in members came changes in the group’s sound, going from an emo/alternative-punk and pop-punk style to a more melodic-hardcore variety, and most recently to a hardcore punk approach.
*****
**From the Depths of Dreams EP (2002-03)**

*From the Depths of Dreams* was Senses Fail’s debut EP, featuring improved mastering and two bonus tracks. 

As is common with many early demos and EPs of this era, the eight songs featured on the EP displays the young band’s energy, passion, and poetic nature. Buddy’s unique voice blends well with the gritty guitars, and Dan’s blossoming drumming talent wraps it all together. Unlike many other bands, where the early demos and EPs are only there for juxtaposition with their later talent and quality, *From the Depths of Dreams* fits nicely with Senses Fail’s later releases.

*[Bloody Romance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwAVD5jVqms)

*[One Eight Seven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bp19vl-Nb4)

*[Handguns and Second Chances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMRYnyo0Rv8)
*****
**Let It Enfold You (2004)**

After the success of *From the Depths of Dreams*, marking a major success for the band.

Often times, but I still hold this album in high regard due to its display of increased skill over the EP, while still maintaining their signature sound and lyricism (*Let It Enfold  You* did however show an increased frequency of emo/self-abuse and relationship subject matter). The guitarmanship present here is varied, skillful, and melodic. Buddy’s vocals, while flawed as he is continuing to find his perfect scream, exhibit emotion and passion not always present in music of this genre. I still can’t help but shiver during the “so follow me” lyric of the track “Bite To Break Skin.” The sound found in this record makes you want to move

*[You’re Cute When You Scream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNcaS2lEOzI)

*[Bite To Break Skin] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar1ZdVNCr5o) I will say that this song has got to be one of the band’s finest.

*[NJ Falls Into the Atlantic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkTcuTh-IaE)
*****
**Still Searching (2006)**

After extensive touring for *Let It Enfold You*, *Still Searching*. The record sold over 200,000 copies in the first month. In the fall of the same year, Vagrant Records released a deluxe edition of the album featuring six bonus tracks (which are fantastic by the way) as well as a behind-the-scenes DVD.

Immediately apparent when playing this album is the amped-up aggressiveness and darker tone. The twin guitars absolutely shine and shred on this album, brilliantly displayed in tracks such as “Shark Attack”. Further inspection of the music will reveal the more serious and mature lyrics regarding alcoholism, depression, and even suicide. In fact, *Still Searching*is a concept album, telling the story of a man struggling through heartbreak and alcohol-abuse, and the associated stress. Several of the songs are based off Buddy’s own life experiences. While definitely a change from *Let It Enfold You*’s somewhat poppy nature, and on some mornings I wake up

*[Sick or Sane (Fifty For a Twenty)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0weYaobEmk)

*[Shark Attack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ_RlLK7G1I)

*[All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues, as they flow directly into each other, and conclude the story of the struggling man. Also some of Senses Fail’s finest work.
*****
**Life Is Not A Waiting Room (2008)**

Released in the fall of 2008, as Glita had left.
While not quite as “heavy” as *Still Searching*, such as “Yellow Angels” and “Fireworks at Dawn”. The lyrical subject matter present in the album is similar to that of *Still Searching*, as it concerns alcoholism and depression, but it’s not nearly as dark.  I’ve done a bit of reading of reviews and comments concerning this album, and it seems to me that some were a little disappointed in the record, feeling that the band had lost a bit of their energy and steam. I even recall someone calling it “half-assed.” I personally really enjoy this album, and there are a few exceptional tracks on it. Definitely give it a listen. That being said

*[Lungs Like Gallows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZDzlEu8588)

*[Family Tradition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec4A6FA1HjE)

*[Map the Streets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgZkVqkG99Q)
*****
**The Fire (2010)**

Recorded and released in the fall of 2010

A quote from a review on AbsolutePunk.net sums up this album perfectly: “Full of aggression and just enough catchiness to please both types of fans.” The melodic hardcore style continues from *Life Is Not A Waiting Room*, I still consider it a very solid release. Buddy continues to display his powerful voice and poetic lyrics, and Dan simply kills it at the drums. The melodic guitar and bass fit wedge in nicely. It is quickly apparent that Buddy has finally found his most comfortable screaming range and style, and displays it strongly on several songs. Listening to the album, one may start to get a hint that perhaps the band is getting a little tired, and fans definitely noticed this. Still, some tracks such as “Lifeboats” and “Irish Eyes” have grown to be some of my all-time favorite songs. This record will always hold a special place in my heart though

*[The Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP0RFjzPZL8)

If you really don’t know much about Senses Fail, as well, and shows a lot of renewed energy and passion that the band may have lost. I consider it the finale of the band’s melodic hardcore style, and ends it with very positive sounding tracks.

**Renacer (2013)**

The recording of *Renacer* took place during late 2012, as well as a new producer Shaun Lopez.

“I’ve always wanted the band to move towards being less pop-driven and heavier and more exploratory. We needed to change it up, which is also the title track, immediately makes apparent the change, as it features only screamed vocals, lowered tuned guitars, and faster rhythms; it brilliantly sets the tone for the rest of the album. Some would say the post-hardcore genre label doesn’t even belong on *Renacer*, as the sound shows a definite shift into hardcore punk territory. What I really love about the record is the much more positive lyrics. The band has finally dropped the themes of alcoholism and depression in order to make way for themes of rebirth and overcoming burdens. I also love how the music often changes from heavy chugging guitars and growling vocals (which sound awesome by the way) into an almost dream-like melody. It’s these traits that convince me on those mornings when *Still Searching* isn’t my favorite album that *Renacer* is. Overall, and *Renacer* contains some of the band’s most powerful tracks to date.

**Epilogue**

I know this is a far-from-perfect guide, they still have plenty of life left in them, and the released of *Renacer* demonstrates that they still have energy and new ideas.

Side-Project Note: Buddy Nielsen was the lead vocalist for an EP released by the hardcore punk act Bayonet in 2011. It features an even harder style than *Renacer*

Lately, like marriage, kids, school, etc.) Since we all have the same influences, I propose this idea to you...

Let's start a Reddit Post Hardcore band! The proposed idea is simple... We start with the basics... I setup a Dropbox account and you all submit your material. I don't care about the quality from the get-go whatsoever. From there, or a fucking amazing riff... I will then clean it up (Or you rerecord it), record something of my own over it (IF IT FITS) and repost it on the Dropbox. Then you all can take a listen and come up with your own little piece of magic and make suggestions on what would fit best.  

From there, and the personalities fit, we then form an official band to call our own. If I get at least 30 comments and/or 15 upvotes for this, I will pursue it will all my heart has to offer. 

REFERENCE - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n48IImd_9vM

In conclusion... WE LOVE THESE BANDS AND THIS MUSIC!!! Why shouldn't we make our own dreams come true?!

EDIT: Please add me as a collaborator on Dropbox so that we can share what we create! Revolver@Gmail.com. If you would like to be added as a collaborator,False,self,t5_2s2pv,True,,,t3_nezd3
