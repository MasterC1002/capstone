The Texans are not the highest-ranked AFC team in Football Outsiders' latest rankings. That honor goes to the Denver Broncos


The Broncos are only 3-3, either. Pittsburgh, San Diego and Oakland have a combined record of 8-10. All in all, Denver's opponents so far this season have gone 24-14. In that light, a 3-3 record is quite an achievement.

Denver has had the misfortune to play so many good teams so early, but lost only four balls. Even more amazing, the Broncos have fumbled nine times, and their opponents have recovered all of them. All together, the Broncos have recovered only four of 19 total fumbles this season. That kind of bad luck is bound to turn around soon.

The good news for Denver is that their schedule is much easier in the future. The 10 teams left on their slate are a collective 21-42


Jeff Gross/Getty Images
Peyton Manning has already made a mark in Denver.
What makes Denver such a quality team? Not surprisingly, no Denver wideout made the top 50 rankings at FO. This year, the team has three receivers in the top 30.

It's not terribly surprising to see a Peyton Manning-led offense playing well. It's a little more shocking to see how well the Denver defense is playing, 18th against the rush and 17th in scoring. However, they rank sixth in DVOA. The biggest reason for that difference once again comes down to scheduling. Denver has played some of the league's best offenses in New England, Houston, Atlanta and Pittsburgh. That's going to throw the Broncos' conventional numbers out of whack, but DVOA adjusts for quality of competition and bumps Denver up several slots.

The Denver defense ranks highly in DVOA not so much because they do any one thing at an elite level, but they're not terribly far from average in either category. They are sixth in sack rate, but they're not particularly strong or weak in coverage against any category of receiver (except in covering running backs, where they rank fourth). The one thing Denver does do better than most teams is prevent the long ball. They've given up only 16 receptions for 20 yards or more this year, tied for fifth-best in the NFL.

The stars of this Denver defense are somewhat unknown. Safety Mike Adams leads the team in plays (the sum of tackles, but he's not in the league's top 40 in that category. Wesley Woodyard has been surprisingly effective replacing the suspended D.J. Williams as Denver's top linebacker. He's in the league's top 10 with 23 run stops (tackles on run plays that prevent meaningful yardage toward a new set of downs), nearly matching the career-high 25 he had last season.

The top playmaker, Miller collected 11.5 sacks, but he was one-dimensional, with only eight defeats (tackles that cause a loss of yardage, turnover or third- or fourth-down stop) against the run. This year, he's even more effective against the pass, with six sacks in six games. Better yet, besting his rookie total with 10 games to go. Only the incomparable J.J. Watt has more total defeats (run and pass) than Miller in 2012. In any other season Miller would be a strong candidate for Defensive Player of the Year,False,

1356592419.0,15icjm,ESPN Insider Scouting Report: Week 17 Broncos v Chiefs.,agobayer,69,13,7,"After watching film of both teams


• Can Kansas City run the ball? Before the season, Mitch Unrein, etc.), but they do an excellent job of filling the gaps and playing with good discipline. The only legitimate offensive weapon the Chiefs have is their run game, led by Jamaal Charles. But if he is forced to bounce runs outside all day, chances are he'll get bottled up. The Chiefs' performance last week (352 rushing yards) makes this a lot more interesting and it will catch Denver's attention.

• Can the Chiefs attack Denver's secondary? Denver's corners do a nice job in man coverage and are solid on the edge. The vulnerability of the Broncos' secondary is between the hashes, that play-action could open up good seam routes.

• How can the Chiefs slow Manning? In reality, it is almost impossible to disrupt him.

• Home QB: Manning might be playing the best football of his career, and although we don't see a ton of explosive plays and huge arm strength, Manning's velocity is good enough and he is uncanny in the short-to-intermediate passing game. His ability to gather information before the snap and read defenses may be better than it has ever been. He will use pre-snap movement to get a read on coverages and how to find a good one-on-one matchups or soft spots in zones.

• Away QB: Brady Quinn has decent athletic ability and movement skills, he should concentrate on low-risk passes -- screens, slants, checkdowns to his running backs, etc. Quinn has almost no chance to keep the Chiefs in the game.

• Key positional battle -- Kansas City RT Eric Winston vs. Denver LB Von Miller: Athletically, who has outstanding size and a big wingspan. Winston's best shot to slow down Miller is to get his hands on him and try to control him physically. We know Miller wins a lot of battles with first-step quickness, but what people don't realize is how strong he is with the ability to play with leverage and use the bull rush. Winston will need help on Miller with TE blocks and RB chips to slow him down.

• Featured player: Middle linebacker Keith Brooking has revitalized his career and stabilized Denver's defense with his intelligence and consistent play. He really helps between the tackles as a step-up-and-fill guy and is a very good break-down tackler. He also gets this defense lined up properly and is a veteran defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio can depend on to make the right calls.

• Film room nuggets: A good chunk of Manning's TD passes come in the second half games


Prediction

**Denver 31**

Kansas City 14	


This should be a lopsided game if the Broncos decide to go all-out. The wild card here is the Chiefs' run game

Before they trounced the Oakland Raiders, it's very possible the Broncos could've been walking into Week 5 with a winning record.

Given how they've played

A lot has been made about the reduced arm strength of Manning after a couple of so-so performances. While it may not be what it once was, offensive linemen were asked to pass protect for 3.7 seconds per dropback. With Manning that number is down to 2.5 and the results are evident; through four games the line has given up 23 combined sacks, hits and hurries -- fourth fewest in the league. In the first four games Tebow started last year, that number was 38 and included one game where Denver only had to pass protect nine times.

Manning has made life easier for his line and kept the team facing less pressure (22.8 percent of dropbacks compared to a league-leading 43.4 percent last year). If you've read this piece

When you add in a defense that has two of the league's premier pass-rushers in Elvis Dumervil and Von Miller (who have already combined for 50 quarterback disruptions), but the early signs are more encouraging than the overall record.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,ocd,

He looked absolutely on point and shrugged off a big hit to throw a TD to Decker on the next play.  Manning's arm isn't yet at 100%, in pass protection but Manning's pocket awareness is so good that should not be sacked often.

Our offensive line is looking solid

Overall, barely hanging on to the last one.

The same old story defensively: Doom and Gloom give the Broncos and elite pass rush

What worries me is our secondary, but the other positions have not looked great.  This is a unit that was absolutely gashed by the elite QBs last season (Rogers, Stafford, Brady) and, the Broncos only invested one draft pick in the unit (CB Omar Bolden in round 4), deciding to improve via free agency with Tracy Porter and Drayton Florence.  Porter is a solid and a worthy partner to Bailey.

Now, he has struggled this preseason and was completely AWOL on Vernon Davis' 40 yard TD catch in today's game.  People keep talking about his potential, but this is the year for him to deliver.  Carter has shown flashes but needs to improve is sophomore season.  Safeties is without question the great weakness of this team. 

Looking forward to a great season and a deep playoff run!  Go Broncos!

1353085486.0,13b0sq,ESPN Insider Scouting Report: Broncos - Chargers,agobayer,56,9,59,"After watching film of both teams


• San Diego must protect the pocket: Denver has arguably the most dynamic pass rush in the NFL as it leads the league in sacks with 31. Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio is doing an excellent job of designing blitz packages with LB Von Miller and DE Elvis Dumervil coming off the edge

• Protect the football: The Broncos have fumbled the ball away 12 times, their opponent, the Chargers, have even more giveaways, thanks to their 12 interceptions. This could be a huge factor Sunday.

• Spread the wealth: Few quarterbacks do a better job of distributing the ball to all of his weapons than Peyton Manning. He has six receivers with at least 23 receptions. His pre-snap reads allow Manning to determine early which side of the field to go to and he rarely tries to force the ball to the wrong target. With all the personnel groupings and multiple-receiver sets he has available

• Home QB: Manning is one of the best at pre-snap reads and checking out of bad plays and into good ones. He understands offensive schemes and how to read coverages. He is not the most agile or quick-footed quarterback but has enough foot agility and feel for the rush that he can side step the rush or step up in the pocket to buy time while keeping his eyes downfield. He is definitely a difference-maker and automatically gives his team a chance to win.

• Away QB: Rivers has prototypical dimensions for the position along with a strong arm that allows him to make all the throws necessary at this level. He can be a precise passer who hits narrow windows and has enough foot quickness and agility to buy time

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' DEs vs. Chargers' OTs: I'm including Miller with Denver's defensive ends as he often gets down in a three-point stance to be an edge rusher on passing downs. Denver brings a lot of heat off the edge with Miller and Dumervil

• Featured player: San Diego needs a big game from RB Ryan Mathews. You can't get into a track meet if you want to beat Manning and these Broncos. If Mathews can get on track and help his Chargers eat up a lot of the clock and maintain good field position

• Film room nuggets: WR Demaryius Thomas is finally showing why the Broncos drafted him in the first round in 2010. He is showing consistency and big-play ability. He has caught 71 percent of the passes thrown his direction and has become a lot more precise in his route running. ... Rivers is throwing a higher percentage of interceptions this year. but it's not all his fault. He was able to throw a lot more passes into crowds when he had Vincent Jackson


Prediction
	
**Denver 31**

San Diego 21	

San Diego has yet to beat a team with a .500 or better record

QB: **2** Manning $20M; Osweiler $0.8M – Total $20.8

RB: **6R/1PS** Moreno $3.3M; McGahee $3M; Ball $1.3M; Hillman $0.7M; Hester $0.7M; Johnson $0.5M; *Fannin $0.4M* – Total $9.9M

FB: N/A

WR: **4R/2PS** Welker $6M; Thomas $2.4M; Decker $1.5M; Caldwell $0.9M; *Orton $0.4M*; *Robinson $0.4M* – Total $11.6M

TE: **4** Tamme $3.5M; Dreessen $3.3M; Thomas $0.7M; Green $0.6M – Total $8.1M

T: **3R/1PS**Clady $9.9M; Clark $1.3M; Franklin $1.2M; *Cornick $0.4M* – Total $12.7M

G: **4R/1PS** Vasquez $6M~; Kuper $5.4M; Beadles $1M; Davis $0.5M; *Boren $0.4M* – Total $13.3M

C: **2R/1PS** Walton $1.5M; Blake $0.5M; *Saulsberry $0.4M* -- Total $2.4M

Currently 23/53 Starters on offense

[A Pie Graph!](http://imgur.com/2mFAQfA)

Offensive Needs to be addressed prove to be limited; the broncos could look to pick up a bit of depth at WR late in the draft.  Runningback is interesting due to the amount of players still on contract with the Broncos although Fannin may get the boot due to injury issues.  Moreno is guaranteed $2.3M of his contract is basically uncuttable due to that.  Kuper is guaranteed $2.7M and may be used as trade bait due to his injury status and the emergence of Zane Beadles.  With Welker signing I doubt the Broncos will look for a full time FB

Strengths: QB, G. Weaknesses: WR depth

**Defense**

DE: **3R/1PS** Ayers $2.2M; Wolfe $1M; Jackson $0.5M; *Beal $0.4M* -- Total $4.1M

DT: **4R/1PS** Vickerson $2.5M~; Knighton $2.3M~; Unrein $0.6M; Siliga $0.5M; *Garland $0.4M* --Total $6.3M~

LB: **7R** Miller $5.7M; Mays $4.2M; Woodyard $3.2M; Bradley $1.1M; Irving $0.7M; Trevathan $0.5M; Johnson $0.5M – Total $15.9M

CB: **5R/2PS** Bailey $11M; Rogers-Cromartie $5M~; Carter $0.7M; Bolden $0.6M; Harris $0.6M; *Ihenacho $0.5M*; *Butler $0.5M* -- Total $18.9M

S: **4R/1PS** Adams $2M; Bruton $1.5M~;Moore $1.2M; Carter $0.7M; *Gideon $0.5M* – Total $5.9M~

Currently that is 24/53 starters signed on defense

[A Pie Graph!](http://imgur.com/vxSUyWS)

K: Prater $3.3M

P: Colquitt $1.3M

KR: Holliday $0.5M

LS: Brewer $0.5M

Special Teams CAP: $5.6M

Defensive needs become adding a pass rushing DE additional depth to DE and DT, the Broncos may also look at the draft where there are several high value DEs that still would be available at 28.  Starter wise the Broncos may not target a high value DT in the draft an instead look to use a rotation of Vick, Knighton and Unrein with Wolfe on 3rd downs.  Linebacker wise the broncos are in trouble, having 7 active LBs is not feasible, and I do not believe Trevathan or Johnson still has PS eligibility.  Look for cuts to bring this number to 6 active LBs.  On the block may be Mays, Johnson or Irving and this decision will probably be made during training camp.  With Rogers-Cormartie look for the Broncos to target CBs in the late rounds, Bolden has injury history and the Broncos will need to acquire 1 more starter.  
I had previously stated the necessity of 3rd CB as Del Rio’s defense employed on average 4.95 DBs on the field per snap.

Strengths: LB

Weaknesses: DE, expensive contracts

Cap room: Dumervil’s release opened up $8.75M in cap space putting the Broncos between $10M-13M depending on the details of our recent signings.  Draft picks at our position should be expected to eat around $4.5M of cap.

The Broncos have 52/53 starters signed at this point

And that is the current state of the Broncos

1351790893.0,12gtcx,ESPN Insider Scouting report: Broncos - Bengals,agobayer,53,9,13,"After watching film of both teams


• Slow down Green: A.J. Green is an elite wideout who is nearly impossible to stop. Andy Dalton looks for Green in a big way in the red zone, as its linebackers and safeties can be exploited in coverage, but Jermaine Gresham has been disappointing this season as both a receiver and blocker. Still, Denver's secondary has consistently improved as this season has gone along, especially with its cornerbacks. And Champ Bailey is still playing at a high level. Drew Brees threw for just 213 yards in Denver last week.

• Get Atkins blocked: While the Broncos' pass protection is very good and Peyton Manning is extremely difficult to sack, Dreessen could help out against Bengals defensive end Carlos Dunlap in this contest. Manning operated from a clean pocket last week and was simply lethal when utilizing multiple-tight end groupings.

• Harass Dalton: Bengals left tackle Andrew Whitworth remains a rock in protection on the blind side, Denver sacked Brees only once. Rookie Derek Wolfe is an interesting player because of his versatility. When Denver shows a three-man front, he handles the defensive end position. But he's usually a heavy-base defensive end on early downs in the Broncos' 4-3. But what Wolfe does best is attack the quarterback from an interior alignment on passing downs, and he benefits in this regard from all the attention that Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil garner on the outside.

• Home QB: At his best, Dalton has done well outside the numbers this season. This offense has not been very efficient on third downs, an area in which Dalton must improve.

• Away QB: Manning's mobility is as good as ever, Manning is handling and defeating the blitz extremely well. This is especially important this week because the Bengals' pass defense has had a tough time when it rushes four or fewer. Manning has been lethal outside the numbers, but most of those completions have been short. He has been terrific in the second halves of games and also has been quite good on third downs. His safety blanket, slot man Brandon Stokley, has been quite effective this season moving the chains.

• Key positional battle -- Bengals' RBs vs. Broncos' front seven: BenJarvus Green-Ellis is a volume runner who will not create a lot on his own. The Broncos' defense is better vs. the run than the pass, an undersized linebacker who covers a ton of ground for the Broncos. He's a playmaker vs. the run and in coverage and was all over the field last week. The Saints rushed for 51 yards in Denver.

• Featured player: Demaryius Thomas is in the midst of a breakout season and is one of the most productive wide receivers in the league. Manning has been very effective with his deep ball, Cincinnati's secondary isn't very strong overall and Thomas' outstanding blend of size, downfield speed, power and ability after the catch will prove extremely challenging.

• Film room nuggets: Vontaze Burfict has been a very nice find for the Bengals. The undrafted free agent has very good size and movement skills for a big linebacker. He plays with a nasty edge and has excelled as a run defender in particular. ... Willis McGahee has been very consistent with his hard-charging interior running along with strong cutback runs, has the makings of a dangerous receiver and has explosive lateral agility, but it is questionable if the coaching staff trusts him in pass protection.



Prediction

**Denver 30**

Cincinnati 13

1343330977.0,x7ez7,My firsthand account of the Broncos first practice,thejerg,42,2,12,"The passing game looked good. Really good. Manning seemed to throw to D. Thomas a lot(who seemed to have no trouble with an expanded route tree). Decker had his fair share as did the TEs(Tamme and Dreesen). Manning is so impressive in person. His timing and reads are impeccable. He makes throwing look so easy.

Franklin was starting at RT and Kuper was in there as well. Looks like Harris is going to be a backup. 

Greg Orton was the surprise of the day at WR. Dude was catching everything and had a wild grab for a TD with the corner all over him. It was a deep ball.

Hard to say much about the D and the running game without seeing them in pads.

They spent a fair amount of time on punt returns with Decker, Thompson and Bolden getting most of the work. Unfortunately Decker and Porter looked the most reliable. I'd rather those two get the chance to focus on their primary positions and not have to worry about returns. 

Osweiler was impressive(for a backup). From what I saw he looked at least as good as Weber and Hanie. He made a couple of mistakes but not as many as Hanie or Weber. Hanie seemed to have a lot of passes deflected and Weber just looked ineffective. Osweiler's passes were mostly on target and seemed very catchable(considering he was throwing to second and third team recievers.

Scheme wise everything was very vanilla. They pretty much stayed with 2 wrs 2 tes and 1 rb, but what they did do looked really solid. I would say Manning has plenty of chemistry with the recievers that matter at this point. 

I was surprised to see a couple of flea flickers in there as well. One with Hanie and 1 from Manning. 

All in all a nice way to start the training camp part of the season.",self,t5_2s51j,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/x7ez7/my_firsthand_account_of_the_broncos_first_practice/

1373151852.0,1hru96,Got two jerseys from a Chinese wholesale company and wanted to give a testimony.,cubedG,43,9,36,"Over the past couple of weeks I've seen a number of threads with questions about jerseys and what sites are legitimate and trustworthy and which ones aren't. With my order just arriving I'd thought I'd give you all my experience.

I initially started looking into the chinese market after realizing that many of the jerseys at nfl shop and other domestic sites are really above what I'm willing to pay for something that willing only be worn days out of the year. I got my two jerseys from http://www.wholesalebusinesscn.net/. Their prices are mostly in and around $20 for all jerseys and shipping is about the same and takes roughly 10 days. I ordered both a Nike Elite Champ jersey and a Mitchell &amp; Ness Atwater jersey. 

[Here is an album of the details on both jerseys.]( http://imgur.com/a/KfiZ1)

**Pros:**

* The quality of the fabric was impressive. Very durable and breathable. 
* Customer service was great. I was able to exchange emails with them throughout the whole process and they answered all my questions. 
* Quality stitching on the the numbers. The look like the real deal. 

**Cons:** 

* Some excess stitching on the Champ jersey
* Continuous stitching between numbers and letters. As you can see on the bottom patch on the Atwater jersey

Overall I was very pleased with the process and the product. The minor mistakes are well worth the low cost of $22 as opposed to the authentic $100+ jerseys you'll find elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend going this route to anyone contemplating it. I hope I was able to help some of you guys out who are on the fence about going the wholesale route.

If you have any questions or would like more pictures I'll be sure to address that in the comments. Also don't hesitate to email them

**Free Agency/Draft Concerns**

Here are the four positions that I feel need to be looked at:

* Nose Tackle
* Safety
* Cornerback
* Runningback

The Broncos have a nice ~14 million to sit on right now, an aging McGahee, and slightly unreliable running backs, perhaps the Broncos might use young talent in the draft to fill these holes. Perhaps the Broncos could look for a Running Back in free agency, but this might only happen if those free agent running backs are willing to take a bit of a pay cut in order to achieve that championship--something Denver is 
definitely a contender for.

###Highs and Lows

**High Points**

* First and foremost, *he'll never be good again* that), Peyton went on to have one of his greatest seasons in history. Backed by our top 10 (I'd dare to say top 5!) defense, Denver is a major contender in the Super Bowl race for next year. Now, you didn't hear it from me, [but...](http://i.imgur.com/scKu7sP.png ""relax, it's a joke"") Peyton and Adrian Peterson of the Vikings both put up great seasons
* How about that Denver D? Last year we were pulling a pretty damn mediocre 20th ranked defense, but even top 5--pushing Pittsburgh for the #1 overall. That is a damn impressive improvement no matter how you look at it and is looking to be improved in the upcoming season.
* Game one against the Steelers. It looked shaky at times
* The first game against San Diego. Words can't express how furious I was after the first half. We were down a whopping 24-0 points at halftime, and meanwhile Peyton got the offense rolling in a way that only the greatest QBs can do. As simple as it is, [the announcer really put it the best.](http://youtu.be/t6jqdHyMSks?t=1m40s)
* Every game after the bye week. To go 3-3 into the Bye

**Low Points**

* The secondary had a couple glaring holes all season. Overall they played great
* Peyton's three picks in the first Quarter at Atlanta. That did not help the argument against Peyton and whether or not he was good
* Struggling against other division heads. Despite our thrashing of Baltimore, they got the last laugh in the end.
* The Chiefs game in Arrowhead. I'm not sure what happened that game
* The second Baltimore game. Peyton throwing 2 picks

After watching film of both teams


• Tampa Bay must dominate the clock: The Buccaneers need a strong ground game with a controlled passing attack that allows them to dominate time of possession and limit Denver QB Peyton Manning's opportunities to come up with big plays. The Bucs can't afford to get into a high-scoring affair with the Broncos as they simply don't have the dynamic players on offense that Denver has.

• Make Freeman uncomfortable in the pocket: Denver has one of the most dynamic pass-rush packages in the NFL. With 37 sacks on the season, especially if this defense is playing with a lead and Tampa Bay has to throw to catch up.

• Running back by committee: Denver was dealt a major blow with the loss of all-everything RB Willis McGahee (knee). Not only do the Broncos need to replace his running skills

• Home QB: Manning is a future Hall of Famer who is still a difference-maker in spite of his missing a year due to injury as well as his age. He doesn't have the arm strength of some quarterbacks

• Away QB: Freeman is a rising star but is still on the inconsistent side. He can make all the throws you need to make at this level and can be extremely accurate when he is on his game. When the ground game is going strong

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' receivers vs. Buccaneers' secondary: Denver is a team that, although the Bucs will be missing their top cover cornerback, Eric Wright, due to a suspension. Manning does not throw many interceptions and could have a big day against this decimated secondary.

• Featured player: Doug Martin

• Film room nuggets: Buccaneers LT Donald Penn has been an elite lineman for the past few years but doesn't get enough credit. He may lack prototypical dimensions for the position but is a great foot athlete with the ability to keep his pad level down and his weight over his feet. He rarely gets out of position and has an excellent sense of leverage. ... Buccaneers TE Dallas Clark has lost a step over the years and will struggle against quality man coverage


Prediction

1351616928.0,12ch1v,ESPN Insider Article - The NFL's best QB (so far),agobayer,43,5,7,"Peyton Manning is playing better than any other quarterback in the NFL in 2012

The problem is

It could remind you a little of another triumphant return. Remember when Michael Jordan announced just how ""back"" he was after a self-imposed exile to Double-A baseball? It happened in Madison Square Garden on March 28, but the game was won when, with his team tied late, Jordan drove the lane and, instead of elevating over Patrick Ewing for the game-winning shot, dished the ball off to an open Bill Wennington for a game-winning layup.

While MJ proved he still had nearly every skill that had made him previously unstoppable, while still brilliant, was more cognizant of some newly realized limitations. It had been two years. And even MJ hinted at it, saying after the game, ""My first notion was to shoot it. I would be lying if I said I was going to pass the ball. I was going to make them stop me, but I was able to get the ball to the open man.""

Self-aware MJ would have been a good storyline, on his final play before that exile, had driven the lane late and dished the ball off, allowing John Paxson to seal a championship.

Now cut to Peyton.

While we busily debate what he has left, he also leads the NFL in Total QBR, and if you drop a six-minute stretch against Atlanta during which he tossed three of his four interceptions on the season, he'd be well ahead in passer rating, too (currently second).

Yes, particularly in the context of how it's being done. But we're caught up in a different form of evaluation, just as we were ever so briefly with MJ, gauging his current performance against the past.

Just consider how we're judging Manning -- and what we're missing.

One of the major questions that has dominated early evaluations of Manning's return is whether he still has arm strength. His deep balls are fluttering. What did all those neck surgeries sap from his strength? What did they mean for the nerves that run down the back of that right arm? Well, brilliantly. Manning has gone 11-for-17 on throws more than 20 yards downfield over his past four games, throwing four touchdowns and zero interceptions.

Deep Impact
Peyton Manning passing more than 20 yards downfield

**Stat	Totals	NFL Rank**

* Comp	11	T-1st

* Comp pct	64.7	T-1st

* TD-Int	+4	T-1st

* Total QBR 100.0T-1st

On the season, is 56 percent, according to ProFootballFocus. He is essentially tied with Drew Brees (56.3) for the NFL lead.
Is this a cagier Manning,"" even though that's a problem area. We can question whether Manning has lost some velocity, but the common perception always has been that Manning isn't a great deep passer based on arm strength, just an accurate one. In 2010, the year before the neck surgeries, Manning's deep-ball accuracy was at 37 percent. Manning is no worse at throwing the deep ball than he ever was, be it in Knoxville or Indianapolis, not just delivering strikes.

What about his mobility? In the ""Monday Night Football"" win over San Diego, just another moment to laugh at a player who always has run like he was pulling a monster-truck tire in a training session. That same 1997 draft report noted that ""Manning will never win a race"" but has ""just enough maneuverability to get past the first defender."" Even with a 12-inch leap.


Manning has been hit while throwing just four times in 2012 and sacked just 10 times

We could suggest Manning's weapons in Denver are far better than anticipated. Demaryius Thomas, we know better. The same group of pass-catchers who many believed held Tim Tebow back in 2011 aren't now responsible for an air attack completing passes at a 20 percent higher rate. Manning, as always, is maximizing the talent around him and adjusting as he allows defenses to dictate what he does. As Kiper wrote in 1997, ""Players have told me Manning knows what's going on [on the field] as well as most offensive or defensive coordinators."" Has anything changed?

**Late Fate
Peyton Manning when trailing in second half this season (* - NFL leader):**

Stat	2012

* TD-Int	9-0*

* Comp pct	66.7

* Pass yds	795

* Total QBR	 93.4*

This is particularly evident late in games. With more time to diagnose, damaged Manning isn't getting worn out; he's getting even. This season, he has thrown nine touchdowns and zero interceptions when trailing in the second half. No other quarterback has a differential higher than plus-4. His 93.4 Total QBR in those situations is the best in the NFL.

While the results show just a 3-3 record for Denver, all while breaking in a new version of its old star.

Except this isn't a new version. Just like Jordan.

After he came back

That's the thing about great athletes. We like to credit late-career success to some innate ability to adapt

Manning might eventually look merely good as the athlete in him fades. And this by no means is an argument that he's the best QB in the NFL,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,t3_12ch1v

What strikes you on film is how fast the Broncos' defense plays

Let's look at them on all three levels and get to know this defense a little better.

Defensive line

The Broncos have made a nice transition under coordinator Jack Del Rio from a 3-4 to a 4-3 front and they are playing it much better than most people expected.

The only marquee player on this line is DE Elvis Dumervil

Derek Wolfe plays DE opposite Dumervil

The Broncos love to show blitz looks with this defensive line

As movement oriented as they are, they sniff out the screen play, they are solid, wrap-up tacklers and they get their hands up to deflect passes. They may not be elite individual players, but as a group they are really sound at a position that was the weakness of this team a year ago.

Linebackers

Much like the defensive line

He is used in a variety of roles -- he lined up as a spy in Week 10 versus Cam Newton, like Dumervil he really has excellent strength and leverage and he can physically bull-rush a lot of OTs back into the quarterback. There are times that he will line up on the same side of the formation as Dumervil and when they go to that overload blitz they can be almost impossible to block.

Weakside linebacker D.J. Williams is back this week from a league-imposed suspension

When you add young players Nate Irving and Danny Trevathan to the mix along with Williams

Inside is veteran Keith Brooking

Like the defensive line, they play sideline to sideline and they really do a good job of protecting their body and not getting ""hooked."" In coverage they will show combo looks with zone drops and occasional man-to-man schemes, but coverage is not their strength. There are a lot of underrated moving parts to this unit.

Bailey
Ron Chenoy/US PresswireChamp Bailey continues to be a force in the Denver secondary.

Secondary

Like the other two units on this defense, usually outside, and his ball skills and instincts make up for any speed that he might have lost.

Veteran Tracy Porter has missed some time due to injury

Inside, especially if the offense catches the Broncos in their base package with Brooking on the field at middle linebacker. This is something that Denver needs to fix.

Ex-Jets safety Jim Leonhard gives the Broncos depth and intelligence and he brings a stabilizing presence to the back end of this defense. They will show a lot of variety in their coverages with tight man, they do a nice job of ""baiting"" WRs by playing off coverages and then jumping routes.

Their most productive blitz is to bring a corner or safety off the slot and with overload pressures where they can send Miller inside the OT and open up the edge for the blitz package. The Broncos' tendency to jump routes could lead to problems against double moves by WRs, the Broncos tackle and they don't make a lot of mistakes.

So, this defense often plays with a lead ... and when that happens the Broncos can tee it up and attack opposing offenses much like we saw when Peyton Manning was in Indianapolis.

The film tells you that this defense is not a fluke. The Broncos have difference-makers on all three levels and they play together and with enthusiasm. And they are not going away. AFC teams should prepare themselves accordingly.",self,t5_2s51j,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/13cbb8/dont_ignore_denver_d_insider_piece/

• Oakland found its ground game: After struggling during the first two weeks of the season

• Denver needs to attack the Raiders on the perimeter: While the Broncos lack great overall team speed on the perimeter

• Denver needs to contain the run with its base defensive front: The Broncos are holding opponents to just 2.63 yards per carry, seventh lowest. This week they need to limit Oakland's ability to gain positive yards on early downs and force them into a passing game. When McFadden and the Raiders are able to get their offense into a lot of second- or third-and-short situations, it makes Carson Palmer that much more effective.

• Home QB: Manning still has a lot to offer despite his 15 years in the league. He understands the game like few ever have and is one of the best QBs when it comes to reading coverages and checking out to a more productive play. He still has the kind of accuracy needed to complete passes but his arm strength is somewhat lacking when it comes to intermediate and deep balls. He can

• Away QB: Last week Palmer led the Raiders to their first victory with a nice come-from-behind win off of three scoring drives in the final quarter. He is a classic pocket passer who can dissect a defense when given time in the pocket; however

• Key positional battle -- Raiders' secondary vs. Broncos' receiving corps: The Raiders' secondary has struggled when it comes to coverage this year and has yet to come up with an interception through three games. If Denver's receivers manage to get free on a consistent basis

• Featured player: Palmer is likely to be without his favorite receiver, it is even more imperative that the Raiders come up with a strong running attack. McFadden is one of the most dynamic ball carriers in the league and a quick start from him this weekend would give the Raiders a much better chance of staying in this game. He not only can move the chains but also can help to keep the ball out of the hands of Manning and his explosive offense.

• Film room nuggets: Denver receiver Demaryius Thomas is getting more looks by Manning but is still a bit inconsistent when it comes to running precise routes and coming down with the ball when challenged. However,,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,True

1357875842.0,16cxb7,ESPN Insider - Do Broncos have any weaknesses? ,agobayer,33,2,31,"*Quick note: I love that this is the title of the article*

It is often said that football is a game of matchups. But it may be more accurate to say that football is a game of strengths and weaknesses. Coaches examine all the matchups to figure out where they have an advantage

That presents a real problem for the Baltimore Ravens as they enter Saturday's divisional-round contest against the Denver Broncos. The Broncos are an extremely well-rounded team without a lot of glaring weaknesses. They finished in the top five of Football Outsiders' ratings for both offense and defense.

Do they have any weaknesses that Baltimore can exploit?

The short answer is no. In fact, Porter came down with an illness in mid-October, left the lineup and ended up demoted when Chris Harris and Tony Carter were clearly better. He's now the fourth corner and won't see the field much, especially against a Ravens team that rarely puts out four-wide sets.

Insider PickCenter
Wondering which side to take? Check out PickCenter and do your research before making that critical decision. PickCenter 

In preparation for this game, the Ravens were usually weak as well.

For example, is explained here.) However, the Baltimore defense isn't particularly good in the first quarter either, ranking 22nd.

As you might expect from a team that depends on Peyton Manning, really need to run for just a yard or two, the Broncos get it more often than not. Denver converted 67 percent of runs in ""power"" situations (third down, fourth down or goal line with 1-2 yards to go), which ranks ninth in the league. Meanwhile, the Baltimore defense, which has been great against the run for over a decade, allowing opponents to convert 76 percent of the time.

On defense, including 27th against red zone passing. However, the Ravens' offense also ranks just 19th in the red zone and is 28th on red zone passes.

Our Adjusted Line Yards statistic, the Ravens are better running up the middle or to the right than they are running left.

Baltimore does have a clear advantage over Denver on special teams, but the negative value is almost all veteran Jim Leonhard; if Trindon Holliday's ankle is healthy enough for him to go, punt returns should be fine. And the Broncos ranked just 26th in FG/XP value, as Matt Prater was just 8-of-13 on field goal attempts over 40 yards despite kicking half the time in high altitude. Of course, in order to force Prater into a long field goal, the Ravens have to stop Manning first.

After going through all the trends and tendencies, Manning was surprisingly weak this season against big blitzes of six or more. Manning had only 5.2 yards per play against big blitzes, compared to 7.9 yards per play the rest of the time. Only Blaine Gabbert was big-blitzed a higher percentage of the time than Manning, who faced six or more on 10 percent of pass plays. He was also poor against defensive back blitzes, averaging just 5.3 yards per play.

Second, and he's even worse now. The Broncos ranked just 24th covering tight ends this season, with players like Jermaine Gresham and Greg Olsen burning Brooking for season-high 100-yard games.

These specific matchups were bright spots for Baltimore when it played Denver a month ago. The Ravens sent four big blitzes, and while Manning completed three of those five passes, the Broncos gained only 16 yards, with no first downs. Meanwhile, Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta caught 7 of 10 pass targets for 125 yards and two touchdowns.

And yet despite doing a good job of attacking these specific Broncos weaknesses

**NFC Champion**

* Bill Polian: Atlanta Falcons  
I picked the Falcons at the start of the season and I see no reason to change up now. Atlanta has a complete team and

 
* Herm Edwards: San Francisco 49ers  
Colin Kaepernick should be able to do enough with his arm (and his legs) to cause some problems for opposing defenses. San Francisco's defense hasn't been as sharp in recent weeks


* Ron Jaworski: 49ers  
The Niners are just a solid football team. If they have to go to Atlanta, the rest of defensive line is much better … it just trickles down to the rest of the defense. You don't often talk about the impact of a defensive lineman, but Justin Smith has that kind of impact on his team.


* Mel Kiper: Falcons  
Finally. Yes, Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez, they can create matchup problems against any defense in the league. This team has often played down to the level of competition, but I view them as a very good ""best day"" team when the offense is clicking. They also have balance as the NFL's seventh-highest scoring offense and fifth-highest scoring defense. I think they get by San Fran to reach a Super Bowl for the first time since Dan Reeves was on the sideline.

**AFC Champion**

* Polian: Denver Broncos  
I picked Baltimore at the start of the season, I'll go with my heart and take Denver. Playoff success usually comes down to team health and an ability to exploit matchup advantages. The Broncos are mostly healthy and Peyton Manning can absolutely exploit any advantages that come his way. Now that New England has to go to Denver, I give the edge to the Broncos.


* Edwards: Broncos  
The Broncos are balanced and the hottest team in the NFL


* Jaworski: New England Patriots  
We could talk about the offense all day long. The Patriots have every dimension you could possibly want. But I've started to see their defense play better, but the performance still showed me that the unit had improved since some of its early and mid-season struggles. Aqib Talib has solidified their man coverage, Devin McCourty is playing well and their pass rush has gotten better. The Pats had a little clunker down in Jacksonville, but I think that was more of a mental lapse than a physical one. And it's one they won't suffer in the playoffs.


* Kiper: Patriots  
The Patriots offense has, the offense was a bit of a dud against Arizona and scored just 18 points. Even then, they left a bunch of points on the field. Other than that, this is a team that scored 23 or more points in every game and averaged 34.8 points per game. That's pretty significant, because it's even more than the unstoppable 2007 Patriots scored. Even when Rob Gronkowski was out, they kept humming along. This team blocks, they can run on you and Tom Brady looks as comfortable as ever. But that's just half of it. The New England defense is seen as a liability, but it's not a bad one. The Patriots were a Mario Manningham catch away from a Super Bowl win last year

**Super Bowl Champion**

* Polian: Broncos  
The difference between the two is very slight


* Edwards: 49ers  
The key difference: The 49ers can run the ball well enough against Denver's defense to keep Manning off the field. On defense


* Jaworski: 49ers  
This is a tough one. But if it was easy, and Delanie Walker and Vernon Davis are matchup nightmares down the field. Plus, they have that violent running attack as well. It adds up to enough of an edge to get by the Pats.


* Kiper: Patriots   
This could be a high-scoring game, and it takes an extremely coordinated effort to slow them. If New England gets to this point with all of those guys healthy, I think they have just enough to top the Falcons even if Atlanta plays really well.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15wxv4/espn_insider_piece_experts_super_bowl_playoff/

After watching film of both teams


• Slow the game down: Kansas City needs to make this a slow game by sticking to the run and sustaining long, they will play into the hands of Denver's explosive edge rushers.

• Protect the edges: Kansas City has two explosive edge rushers -- outside linebackers Tamba Hali and Justin Houston -- and Manning is not the most elusive quarterback in the NFL. Look for Denver to do a lot of situational substituting to keep a back or tight end in to help protect the edge and give Manning more time in the pocket.

• Play from a lead: Everybody wants to score quickly, they are in trouble. Their line struggles to protect the pocket and none of their quarterbacks has shown the ability to take the team downfield on winning drives late in the game.

• Home QB: Kansas City has been struggling at quarterback. Both Matt Cassel and Brady Quinn have played

• Away QB: Manning is the epitome of a game-changer. He is one of the best at checking out of a bad play and into a good one from the line of scrimmage

• Key positional battle -- Broncos' OTs vs. Chiefs' OLBs: The Chiefs generate a dynamic pass rush off the edge with outside linebackers Hali and Houston. They both bring an excellent combination of speed, counter moves or strength to collapse the pocket. Denver's tackles, Ryan Clady and Orlando Franklin, will have their hands full as they try to keep Manning upright.

• Case for the underdog: Hali and Houston have the potential to come up with game-changing plays for the Chiefs. They both have the speed to come off the edge and have developed strong counter moves when needed. They have the ability to transfer speed into power when needed. If the Chiefs hope to keep this game close

• Film room nuggets: Manning has shown consistent improvement after a year-long layoff. He is looking as confident as ever


Prediction


**Denver 30**

Kansas City 17	

Denver's defense should dominate a struggling Kansas City offense.

• Broncos still a work in progress: This Peyton Manning-led offense gets better each week as it improves chemistry, the Broncos show a lot of pre-snap movement to confuse QBs and they are changing up their coverages on the back end. Chargers QB Philip Rivers will have to be very solid in his pre-snap reads. The Chargers will try to confuse Manning with some pre-snap movement and changing coverage looks of their own.

• This is not the Chargers' passing game we are used to seeing: In the past this has been a vertical passing attack with a lot of seam routes and big shots, the Chargers were not getting a lot out of their edge passing game, but with Malcom Floyd playing well and Robert Meachem finally coming around, defenses have to honor those outside routes, and that opens up the middle, where TE Antonio Gates loves to work.

• Third down is a key: San Diego's offense is in the top third of the NFL in third-down conversions while Denver's defense is in the bottom third at getting off the field on third down, and if his run game is working, it will set up nice play-action opportunities, especially on third down. Denver's defense needs to be really good on first and second down to force Rivers into predictable third-and-long situations.

• Home QB: Rivers has terrific skills, he is much more settled in 2012. He has excellent touch and accuracy and is terrific at recognizing defenses and reading his progressions. Denver defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio will use a lot of pre-snap movement to try to confuse Rivers and force some mistakes, but Rivers really works hard to prepare for a defense. This will be an interesting chess match between Del Rio and Rivers.

• Away QB: Manning is really starting to get into a groove with his receivers, curls, outs, etc. He will work out of the shotgun at times with some no-huddle looks and will continue to make pre-snap adjustments to exploit the Chargers' defense. His receivers must be on the same page in sight adjustments. He will involve his backs and TEs in the passing game and is taking fewer chances than he was earlier in the season.

• Key positional battle -- San Diego OTs Jared Gaither and Jeromey Clary vs. Denver edge pass-rushers Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil: These offensive tackles have great size, so that is something to watch.

• Featured player: Mathews has had a roller-coaster 2012 season, Mathews has much more explosiveness and big-play ability than the other two guys, both in the running and passing games. Denver has struggled to get off the field on third down and its gap discipline has been up and down. San Diego would love to control the flow of the game with a clock-eating run game to keep Manning and the Broncos' offense on the sideline.

• Film room nuggets: Miller earns his paycheck as a pass-rusher, he can line up wide and take on the best wideout without help, he can play inside over the slot, and he can play man or zone. His instincts and ball skills are off the charts, and he can be effective as a blitzer.

I like that the Broncos not only want to win now, by signing Manning, but they also want to win down the road, by drafting what they think is a worthy predecessor.

We're seeing some truly tremendous displays that are redefining the way we view positions, the upshot being that our PFF grading system is giving out some of the highest marks we've ever seen.

While that's something to celebrate

Let's run through the contenders

**The Front-Runners: J.J. Watt and Von Miller**

Let me be clear: If these two aren't the first guys you're mentioning for this award

Take Watt. He has 14 batted passes this season. We started PFF in 2008, and you've got a true impact player who is almost unstoppable.

Still, he is tied with Watt with 13 tackles for loss (only Lavonte David has more). In Miller's rookie season, he was more of a pass-rushing specialist, but he's taken his game to another level, becoming a real every-down force and a worthy defensive player of the year.

**The Somewhat Overrated: Aldon Smith**

This is what happens when you look at what a player has done on 2.5 percent of his total snaps and decide he deserves an award because of it. Smith is having a good season

Smith isn't the run defender Watt or Miller is and is only eighth in terms of the amount of pressure per play he was picked up. A good season? Yes. But he hasn't done enough outside of his sack total.

**The Dark Horse: Geno Atkins**

It's criminal how underrated Atkins is. He doesn't get the attention of Ndamukong Suh or have the champions Haloti Ngata does

The most productive interior pass-rusher in the NFL, and then some.

**The Forced Fumble Machine: Charles Tillman**

What can you say about Tillman that hasn't already been said? Eight forced fumbles in a season is quite frankly ridiculous

That's the definition of playmaking, and you've got a difference-maker. He's not at the Darrelle Revis level of cornerback play, but he's been extremely effective.

As with any of these awards

He's that good,False,self,t5_2s51j,False,,ocd,t3_14co4r

**Player Summary**


The Broncos did not expect to be able to grab Sylvester Williams in the 2013 draft.  Said John Elway, we had him very high on our boards.”[[1]]( http://www.denverbroncos.com/multimedia/videos/Elway-Fox-Break-Down-Day-1-of-Draft/01e2c523-5fdf-4d79-b748-d69268b2597b)   The unexpected fall of Shariff Floyd to the Vikings at 23 (when some analysts had predicted him as high as the top 10) gave the Broncos an opportunity to steal a talent perhaps above their pick number.

Sly’s road to the NFL has been a longer one than many first-round picks.  After quitting football in high school, and after two seasons there he found himself fielding numerous calls from prestigious university football programs.  Williams decided on UNC, where he immediately started on an already impressive defensive line.

William’s greatest asset is his incredible physical strength.  He has the rare physical skills to push the pocket back and either disrupt runners before they make their cut or apply interior pressure to the quarterback.  If he is able to translate his impressive college contributions to the pro game


**Stats and Notables**


Sylvester Williams has only two seasons of play in the ACC

* 2011:  13 games, 2.5 sacks
* 2012:  12 games, 6.0 sacks

http://www.cfbstats.com/2012/player/457/1040524/index.html


**How he will benefit the Broncos**


Did you guys watch the Sports Science on Williams???  Seriously.  [Here it is.]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9GZz4l2Sxs)  Go watch

Ok, *33 inch thighs???*  10 yards in 2 seconds?  Accelerates to 14mph in two steps?  That’s straight-up ridiculous.

If Williams is able to mature into commanding double-teams (especially to aid smaller centers), that just puts him right where Von can chase him down (unless he wants to put up hurried throws for Champ and Chris Harris to grab).  Although much talk this offseason has been concerning how to replace the pass rush we lost due to that [stupid fax machine]( http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-puppetconf-2012/images/office-space-printer-beat-down-gif.gif), no one said it had to come from the DE position.  Though a DT will never record sacks like a DE, quarterback hurries and tackles for loss have the same effect of making every other defense player on the field a little better.

Most criticisms of him surround the downsides of his incredible size.  First, with the signing of Terrance Knighton (who, amusingly, was cited by [nfl.com]( http://www.nfl.com/draft/2011/profiles/sylvester-williams?id=2539270) as Sly’s NFL comparison) the retention of Unrein and Vickerson, and the projected continued growth of Wolfe, Williams will probably not be expected to be a three-down player his first year.  Second, his size might it difficult for him to change directions to capture elusive quarterbacks or shifty runners once he reaches the backfield.  Sly will probably not be chasing down Cam Newton--fortunately

In short


**Final Thoughts**


Position players get all the hype, Sylvester Williams will be a rock in the center of our defensive front for years to come.

1373244078.0,1htzu9,[Closer Look]: Champ Bailey CB #24,ignitionnight,30,4,17,"**Player Summary**

Champ Bailey was born and raised in Georgia, but a standout wide receiver and special teams threat as a kick returner. Champ Bailey became the first person in almost 40 years to start the same game on Offense and Defense. In 1997 not only did Charles Woodson take Peyton Manning's Heisman, he had an [arguably lesser season than Bailey did in 1998.](http://www.dawgsports.com/2012/7/16/3161736/georgia-bulldogs-champ-bailey-heisman-trophy-ea-sports-ncaa-football-13) Champ Bailey won the Bronco Nagurski award in 1998 as a Junior and the nation's #1 defender. He did this all while also being 10th in the SEC in receptions (47) and 6th in the SEC in receiving yards (744). In addition to the Nagurski award Champ was a consensus All American in 1998, and first team all SEC in 1997 and 1998.

In the 1999 NFL draft Champ Bailey was drafted as the 7th overall pick by the Washington Redskins. His impact was immediate

Just before the 2004 season Champ Bailey was traded to the Denver Broncos for Clinton Portis, but one of the best cornerbacks the league has ever seen. Not only does he shut down his side of the field in the passing game with 34 interceptions as a Bronco (4th in franchise history), Champ has erased the preconception of cornerbacks being soft and shying away from contact he with 507 tackles in Blue and Orange (10th in franchise history). In the 2005 and 2006 seasons Champ had arguably the most dominant seasons by any cornerback in history. He intercepted 18 passes for 3 TDs, while amassing 134 tackles. He continued to get robbed of major awards and finished just second for Defensive Player of the Year. According to Ron Jaworski was only challenged 35 times for just 4 completions and 0 touchdowns. In 2009 Bailey was challenged just 80 times over the whole season and allowed zero touchdowns.

**Stats and Notables**

[Pro-Football-Reference: Champ Bailey](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BailCh00.htm)

* 12 Pro-Bowls - Most all time for CB position
* 3 time First-team All-Pro (2004
* 4 time Second-team All-Pro (2000, 2012)
* 2 time Defensive Back of the year (2005

**How he will benefit The Broncos**

Champ isn't the same player as he was 7-8 years ago, as well as incredible agility. Players will often mention his hips as a key to making defensive plays, Champ can adjust his body plant and change direction better than most players 10 years his junior. This allows him to stay close to quick receivers underneath and keep up with speedier receivers on double moves and deep bombs on the outside. Corners are often thought of as receivers who can't catch, this is entirely untrue for Champ. His ball skills and ability to snag a pass are also an elite skill that few players at his position can match. This is possibly due to the extended time and reps he received at Georgia playing wide receiver. 

Champ's ability to shut down receivers is well known and appreciated, often against bigger players. If you watch most corners they will often tackle by dragging down or holding on for dear life until a linebacker can come in and finish the job, not with Champ. He has great tackling technique, always placing his facemask straight ahead, wrapping the legs up and driving the ball carrier backwards. This skill and ability is almost unheard of for the corner position. Calling him a crutch for the front 7 would be unfair to the rest of our defense, but at the same time he has the ability to bail out missed assignments and missed tackles which is a luxury any team in the league would love to have.

**Final Thoughts**

Champs critics will say at 35 he has slowed down, in 2010 the Broncos went 4-12 and were absolutely decimated talent wise by Josh McDaniels. Going into the 2011 season with Tim Tebow as starting QB we had virtually no hope on the horizon, Bailey was a free agent and at 33 years old nobody would have blamed him for chasing a Super-Bowl with a contender. He could have gone anywhere and started and helped a team make a run at a superbowl, but instead he stayed committed to the organization and us the fans. Without Bailey there is no way our defense makes the incredible turn around it did in 2011 and I'm willing to bet PFM never comes to Denver. He is without a doubt the most important player this franchise has had since Elway and Terrell Davis.

Champ Bailey's career will always have doubters based on his relatively low number of interceptions

I'm a long time fan and I'm (finally!) going to my first Broncos game. I convinced my wife this is the year and we just bought tickets through NFL ticket exchange (Section 105) to the season opener against Baltimore on Sept 5th. 

To say I'm jacked up right now would be a massive understatement!!!

I've never been to a game before (or Denver for that matter!) and I'd appreciate any suggestions you may have to help me get the most out of the experience! My wife and I are out of towners

Any and all recommendations you may have is greatly appreciated.

My head is spinning still but here are a few random thoughts that come to mind:

- How long of a drive is it from airport to the stadium with game-day traffic ?
- Decent hotel close to the stadium ?
- Not so nice areas to stay away from ?
- What is the earliest we can get into the stadium ?
- Any must see places (either in the stadium or close by) ?
- Chants besides IN-COM-PLETE ? ;)
- Is it September yet ?
- Seriously is it September yet ?

Point blank he fucked up huge. Like, our outstanding Dline pressure has masked how vulnerable our secondary has been. While the loss comes down on more than one person (see also Champ, PFM, Prater, Fox, Refs, etc)

Rahim knows it. Go look at how many people have posted on twitter he needs to kill himself. Ya, I've gained a bit of respect for Moore. Theres a lack of people taking responsibility in professional sports as a whole, but Rahim Moore sat there last night, took full blame, and manned up and let everyone know that his failure led to the team's failure. You dont see that kind of attitude enough in the league, and its huge. 

Whatever happens from here out with him, but manning (no put intended) up and taking the blame, and becoming a better player from it. It's hard to swallow, but I have much more respect for a player who screws up and has the character and professionalism to realize his mistake, then some scumbag who makes that play but is nowhere near as professional in his actions.

1356633605.0,15j2pf,"ESPN Insider Upset Watch : Colts - Texans, or Why the Broncos will get the #1 seed.",agobayer,29,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15j2pf/espn_insider_upset_watch_colts_texans_or_why_the/

The Houston Texans may still have the best record in the AFC, as two of those wins came in overtime to Jacksonville and Detroit teams that are a combined 6-24.

The Texans' best win during this recent string may have been two weeks ago


Of course, but it is a reasonable assumption that the Colts will take the field with a little extra fire in their bellies to go with the usual home-field advantage.

Of course

The latter is a bigger problem than the former, and they have managed to take away the ball with a turnover on just 6.5 percent of drives, the worst figure in the league. That all combines to rank the Colts dead last in our defensive ratings. The Colts are last against the run, next-to-last against the pass and they rank 27th or lower on first, second and third down. Their biggest defensive strength is preventing passes to running backs (they rank fourth) but that won't help much since the Texans don't pass to the running backs as much as they used to.

Yet as bad as the Colts defense is, they rank 21st in passing and 24th in rushing. Wide receivers other than Johnson are mostly absent from the passing game; Kevin Walter has a catch rate of just 60 percent, his lowest since 2007; and Texans running backs have been stuffed for a loss or no gain 21 percent of the time (23rd in the NFL). However, Colts defenders have been so poor at tackling running backs in the open field that Arian Foster is bound to get a couple of highlight-level runs.

Indy's best bet to keep its defense off the field is to keep its offense on, as the Colts rank 25th in DVOA on first down and 21st on second down, but ninth on third down. Indianapolis has been strong on the ground on third down, second in DVOA behind New England, while Andrew Luck is particularly good at converting tough third-and-long situations. Luck has converted a league-leading 39 percent of the time on third or fourth down with 7-plus yards to go. (The league average, and Matt Schaub's rate, is 28 percent.)

It won't help that the Texans have trouble getting to the quarterback on third downs. On first and second down, that is cut in half to 4.4 percent, which is 25th.

Whom will Luck connect with when he makes the big play? Well, but 28th against No. 2s. We saw this trend when these teams played a couple of weeks ago, as Reggie Wayne had just three catches for 14 yards, while T.Y. Hilton had three catches for 78 yards and a touchdown.

**Cover Watch: Arizona (plus-16.5) at San Francisco**

Are you ready for the Brian Hoyer Show? Yes, especially against the pass. DVOA ranks them second, behind only Chicago. However, their run defense ranks 20th, which is a problem against a 49ers team that likes to keep it on the ground. If the Cardinals fall behind, the 49ers will go into a very effective clock-killing mode, so Arizona needs to keep it close from the start.

The trick may be to send as much pressure as possible, this has been a lockdown pass defense led by Patrick Peterson; no defense is stronger against passes to the right side. That's important because both Colin Kaepernick and Alex Smith have been best passing to their right. On right-side passes at least 10 yards past the line of scrimmage, the average NFL quarterback has completed 44 percent for 9.9 yards per play and Kaepernick has completed 65 percent for 14.8 yards per play. But Arizona opponents have completed just 37 percent for 8.0 yards per play.",,False,self,t5_2s51j,,http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/15j2pf/espn_insider_upset_watch_colts_texans_or_why_the/
