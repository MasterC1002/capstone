This is it. After much learning and experimenting my wifi Wikipedia Server / messaging service is setup. It features: 

Legend:

1. 30 watt monocrystalline solar panel 
2. 30 Amp solar charge controller (supports up to 450 watts).
3. Watt's Up DC electricity consumption meter to measure actual watts / peak watts / amps going to the battery.
4. 85 Amp hour deep-cycle battery
5. Another Watt's Up meter to measure actual DC load coming off the battery.
6. 400 watt DC-to-AC inverter 
7. AC Kill A Watt electric usage monitor to measure / compare AC/DC conversion loss and track total hours / watts consumed 
8. Buffalo Wifi router with custom WRT firmware to redirect connected devices to the wifi to server 
9. Small web server running Debian

Stats:

* Total operating electricity consumption: ~10 watts. 
* Total cost in parts: ~$480 (including misc cabling and connectors)
* Given [5 hours of sun](http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/reno-nevada.html) the setup can generate about 150 Wh, consumes about 240 Wh in a given 24 hour period (10 * 24). Starting with a fully charged battery it should last longer than a week straight meeting my requirements. 
* I could investigate adding another 30 or even 100 watt solar panel to be able to last indefinitely as well as charge phones and other devices without worry of running down the server.

I was a total noob when I started this project. Barely knew the different between AC and DC power. I also learned a lot from asking questions on [http://electronics.stackexchange.com](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/19707/powering-a-30-watt-computer-in-the-middle-of-the-desert).

I've already read the basic-introductions Google document, nobody's learning anything.

I know for a fact I can't be the only one here who is a little confused about some things.

**1. Optimistic worst case assumptions.**

It seems to me that you're assuming that ""things won't get too bad"", you'd hate to waste all that work if the government demands to see your wireless traffic, or even simply banned wireless routers (as already happened for a while in 2008 in China).


**2. Chicken and egg problem.**

All the schemes so far require some critical density of Darknet nodes in your neighborhood to work.  As people have pointed out, and that it won't be useful to ""the average guy"" until there are literally millions of users.

How are we going to get those users with nothing concrete to offer?


**3. Hardware transport layer issues.**

A lot of the issues being discussed relate to the hardware transport layer.

Wifi (i.e. radio) has a lot of benefits


**4. The network topology.**

I can certainly see the advantages of a mesh topology


**Invert your assumptions!**

So let's start by turning a lot of the ideas on Darknet completely upside down.

Let's assume:

* Darknet should be useful even if there are only two nodes in it.
* Darknet should be hardware transport-layer agnostic - in other words
* Sets of Darknet nodes should be allowed to use their own routing and connection strategies
* Sets of Darknet nodes should be allowed to use their own encryption and authentication strategies.

**Just the right level of generality?**

But wait

Well, connections, and all that, we do want the possibility of interoperation between any two nodes.

That means first that we have to agree on the top-level protocol - what our ""packets"" look like.

And while we aren't agreeing on our routing, or messages from public individuals to anonymous individuals and so on.

More subtly, and all that, if we need to interoperate we need to agree on the _names_ for our specific strategies - so one node can negotiate strategies with another one.

Then we can start working on specific hardware channels and software services.

**Advantages to the generalized problem.**

* I'm a huge fan of [steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). Part of the reason that I'm proposing a more general framework is that I'm a firm believer in the idea of hiding the information in plain sight - and the fact that I didn't see a way in the current Darknet scheme to hide Darknet traffic within other
* It seems to me that we have more software people than hardware people, topologies and that sort of thing.
* By having an abstract hardware layer, all sorts of steganographic ideas as I mentioned before, megahertz audio (which is tightly directional), a plain old wire, ""acoustic"" encoding using plain-old-telephone style modems, and exotic things like encoding/decoding into Morse.

**Thanks for reading!**

This is a noble undertaking and I'm all for it!  I welcome your comments and questions.

1355000362.0,14ihxs,I am an electronics and network engineer with mass production capabilities. What Can I do to help?,BlueTequila,415,58,173,"I posted a thread under a very similar name a few months ago. I felt very welcome but nothing productive came from it. Here is what I can do to help.

1. Engineer stuff. Tell me what you want and I will design it

2. Mass produce stuff. I will have access to a pick and place machine in  a few months pending loans and the right price. This will happen

3. Design new protocols. Several of my friends are very skilled programmers and in favor of a darknet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nah4BQ9y8IY

The machine wont be as nice as this one and my solder oven can only do about 8 square feet of boards an hour. 

If you help me design the product that will be your messiah I promise that it will be manufactured only slightly above cost. Money doesnt make me happy

One thing that I dont want to get hung up on is data rate. It seems that goals are set way too high. Range

Edit: Tell me the specs

Extra Edit: Thank you all very much for the input. Im going to go mostly solo on this and stop replying to most of the comments. If you have something very important to add then feel free to post. Ill update you guys when I have something for you. I made the mistake of thinking that a darknet also applied to emergencies but you guys seem to think that its a means of preserving the net as it exists today which is great but my area of interest lies more in disaster situations. Im not active on this board so if at a later date you need circuit design just PM me.

My goal as it currently stands is to set up a 10mile radius of communication with a BBS type of service that uses a GUI without using an antenna that exceeds 20'. This seems to be within reason.

As many of you have probably noticed, I think it is time for an honest discussion between the members of this subreddit on what our goals should be. As SOPA and ProtectIP go through the Senate and House in some fashion, we need to begin our planning for the day when corporations and government censor the internet as they like. On the more outreach and PR side of this project, I have a couple of announcements. But, I believe this post is a good place to discuss technical and overall planning ideas of the movement. First though, here is what I am working on with outreach and organization:

**Consolidation of Anti-Censorship Movements:**

Divided, we may be able to actually make a difference. I have reached out to a couple of groups already. It is imperative we collect a list of all groups working on this issue, however, if we are going to succeed. If you know of a group we should be working with, please post in the relevant post I have added in the subreddit.


**Meshnet Conferences:**
This will be the year the free web begins, workshops, planning sessions, etc in order to allow each attendee to build their own network in their own area. In order to do this, I need the help of the community to reach out to speakers and groups to sponsor and work with the conference in order to make it a success. At the moment, plans are to have the first to conferences in Denver and New York City. My goal would be to have these planned for sometime in the second half of 2012. Please contact me if you have any ideas on how to help plan this.

Also, I suggest you check it out. The wiki is supposed to be bilingual but not all pages are in English. [The important one](http://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/guides/openwrt+batman/) is though, so that's cool.

Time and time again, destructive comments and constant naysaying are ruining the integrity of the IRC discussions. At the risk of sounding like a jerk, allow me to say that you are absolutely wrong for saying wireless mesh nets are impossible.

Wireless mesh nets are not impossible. They are difficult, establish or maintain wireless mesh networks. Here are a few very successful projects that have been brought to my attention in just the last week:

1. [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net/en), Europe and Central America.

2. [Friefunk](http://start.freifunk.net/), Gadow, Berlin, Rostock and Dresden.

3. [Air-Stream.org](http://www.air-stream.org/)

4. [MIT/Nortel Wireless Mesh Network](http://www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/getting-value/collaborations/nortel), minimizing data loss and dead zones.

5. [The Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network](http://www.awmn.net/)

6. [South African Wireless Access Groups](http://www.wug.za.net/)

In a previous thread, why not take control of our personal data while we're at it?

Imagine this magical little box that promises to give you freedom. The hardware supports a cause to free the internet from corporate and government control, chat, social networking, blogging, news feeds, wikis, cloud storage and more. This magical device will provide all the hosting

I think this could be a really great selling point for the masses. The box is small enough to carry with you

The software suite would include:

[LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) - the main building blocks for any hosting platform. Possibly use PostgreSQL instead.

[Zimbra](http://www.zimbra.com/products/zimbra-open-source.html) - a collaboration server for hosted e-mail, and more. A replacement for Gmail, Gcal, and document sharing. Comes with a web interface and exchange support. Simply amazing.

[Z-Push](http://z-push.sourceforge.net/soswp/index.php?pages_id=1&amp;t=home) - an open source ActiveSync server. Allows for full email/calendar/contact sync with any mobile device that supports exchange.

[Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Diaspora) - a decentralized social networking platform. You own your data. I'm not sure if it's ready for prime-time though. Might replace this with Elgg.

[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/download/) - an open source blogging platform with a lot of extensive plugins and themes. The right plugin and theme can turn Wordpress into an eCommerce, social network, or any other web platform you can think of. There's even a Craigslist conversion.

[Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/) - a media platform that allows you to share photos and videos. You can even let others upload to you. Meant to replace Flickr.

[Syncanny](http://www.syncany.org/) - an open source cloud storage and synchronization tool meant to replace Dropbox with something more secure. Supports many different platforms and protocols

[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) - the popular open source wiki engine that runs Wikipedia. Allows you to build and host your own wiki!

[Pligg](http://pligg.com/about/) - an open source news platform with community sharing and voting

[ProjectPier](http://www.projectpier.org/) - an open source project management system. Similar to ActiveCollab and Basecamp.

[TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) - allows yourself and others to avoid tracking

This is all I can think of for now. There's also going to be web-based management like Webmin and other goodies like FTP and SAMBA server. The possibilities are endless! 

Please let me know what you think about this compilation. Are there better software alternatives than what is listed? Am I missing something? I'm looking to put all this software together in a VM and streamline the setup process while waiting for the Raspberry Pi boards to release. If you have anything to add to the list

you might want to reconsider.  That's the last time I'll say anything to dissuade you.  By
this point I'll assume you've weighed the pros and cons
GITMO and never seeing any of your family, being tried for your
beliefs in front of family and friends and watching them hate you
hot coals and BBQ'd and then turned into a reality tv special that everyone can fap to while
congratulating themselves on how normal and functional they are.

This may be for people you care about.  Is your kid really smart?  They might end up not fitting
the mold that you cast with your silence.  They might end up getting themselves killed with their
ideas.  With their love for humanity
a world where people are done away with for their ideas?  Do you want to bring back the Salem

**--- [Current Situation]**

We are trading our personal information to a few large corporations in exchange for connectivity
and user interfaces we're used to.  Before thinking about it
the people who use Google
that offer the services.  What could they possibly be gaining?  And look at what we've gotten for
free!  Hah!  We made off like bandits.

While we're right
getting something for nothing.  We're definitely getting something for something.  That something
is a quantified representation of our behavioral patterns that allows for an eerily complete 
picture of who and what we are.

One trend that concerns me most is the intersection between entitlement
foreign productivity
easily seize power in our security-obsessed society.  Under the guise of keeping us safe they 
could silently blackmail us all into paying for reputation insurance or something along these 
lines.  The amount you pay would of course be proportional to what you had to lose
insurance.  It'd be relatively cheap to keep the average man's search history from his wife 
(think car insurance, but if you were running for office 
or trying to do anything in the public sphere?  Expect to fork over the cash accordingly.

The reason this model might come into play is the average American's purchasing power has been
weighted down by debt and our productivity has slumped.  The retail economy will eventually 
collapse

The truth is
only be used for advertising.  Something that is simply not true.  It's mind blowing how hidden
in plain sight this weapon is.  In fact it's so threatening
even consider it most people won't even entertain the thought that it is a weapon.  To put it 
in the framework of a 90s action movie.  Imagine this happy scientist who loves his family
imagine he's played by Will Smith.  He develops this amazing breakthrough technology that saves
all these people money by streamlining all of these processes by using personal data.  He's 
celebrated as a hero and settles into his awesome life as a successful scientist when some foreign
soldiers kidnap his wife and kid and hold them hostage.  They want access to his system in order
to extract data on their ex leader.  Blah blah blah.

Now swap Will Smith with Larry Page.  Swap the foreign soldiers for Blackwater

Swap the caring public with this lathargic
months where that power swap will take place.  They are implying the power now.  They are 
attempting to take it globally.  They have the technical means.  This system has been
technically feasible for probably the last 10 years.  And I could have written a comprehensive
surveillence system myself in that time.  If I could have written it alone
it exists.  Probably in a shockingly more sophisticated form.  Cisco has been making gear for deep
packet inspection for years.  Storage is fast and cheap.  Crypto hasn't been overhauled or 
considered in the public eye for at least 10 years.  Does this alarm you?  Do you still trust RSA?
Do you remember Bill Clinton's calls for key escrow?  The arguments that ensued?  Do you remember
when the NSA suddenly stopped pestering Phil Zimmerman? 

This is happening now.

**--- [Strategy]**

Do not underestimate the opponent.  Especially since all that R&amp;D $$ went into the security
industry after 9/11.  This
they can't decipher your cryptographic traffic
Which can detect what a type of traffic looks like.  Large
in rapid succession from one IP to another looks like a Server -&gt; File file transfer
lots of full packets from lots of sources to one IP might look like a Torrent file transfer.

It's not just what you say
cryptography makes at least two extra statements (in addition to the one you used the crypto
to make).  It says ""I kind of know what I'm doing"" (red flag?)
have something to hide in the future"" (red flag!).

I joined the darknet

Ingredients: 
 - One Internets
 - Some People Who Care About Our Freedoms
 - Open Source Cryptograpic Seasonings
 - Open Source Other Things (Linux, etc)
 - A Large Pair of Balls (figurative

  I've been reading about the progression of the Darknet plan

  Back in the day

  About a year ago, bought an 8dBi omni antenna kit, and found a Linksys AP on Ebay for about 15 bucks.  I installed the antenna on my roof, and have it coming in through a hole pre-drilled from my former dish service, which I caulked up once the wire was fished through.

  My neighbor has since been able to afford her own internet

  I also happen to have an old desktop PC that I got from a previous employer when they were doing an upgrade.  This PC is otherwise worthlessly outdated

  So, not including the P4 desktop PC, which was free, was about $50, but only because I had some difficulties finding the right adapters to go from my antenna cable to an older connector.

  That said, but back then, each link in a node caused a relative bandwidth reduction of about half, once throughput, half duplex comms, and encryption were considered.  Is this still the case?  I will be Googling the subject in my spare time, whenever that happens, and someone can link me to a whitepaper on it

  Meanwhile, once some of the more basic issues have been worked out.  Of course, that's just, like, my opinion, man.

EDIT-  I'm also trying to find a decent priced higher gain antenna to put with the laptop (USB preferably).  I'm not able to allow outside access to my network because I work for the ISP and they wouldn't be happy about it, for those of you that are fortunate enough to use this properly.

UPDATE : My radio showed up today

UPDATE 2 : My radio was DoA.  Got my refund and bought a new one.  The one I purchased before was a used one from ebay.  Found a place to get them new for $69 shipped [here.](http://www.streakwave.com)  It should be here tomorrow or Tuesday (today is 6/3/12/)

Update 3 : Have everything installed and running.  I was hoping to test different channel spectums, this is through a few trees without a problem.  It's also able to connect to my DroidX phone from this distance.  Tells me that this thing line of sight has a whole lot more to offer.

I believe that it may be more practical to attempt a darknet/internet hybrid (for now). Imagine that the darknet mesh handles a sort of initial handshake/key exchange (also could perform a secure/trusted DNS lookup of sorts) and then the bulk of the actual encrypted data transfer takes place over the existing internet. This would require an evesdropper to monitor both darknet AND internet traffic to even determine the sort of data being sent. Packets sent via the internet could even masquerade as something else.

This method could fall back to pure darknet usage if it failed to connect over the internet

Besides the lack of coordinated effort (which is difficult until you actually have something sensible to work on), worse yet, that DNS is needed to really get this thing going.

It's not.  The basis of a network is being able to reach all of the nodes in it.  This is accomplished with addressing and routing.  Any wide area network that is constrained by bandwidth (basically all of them) can not simply broadcast traffic from each node to all other nodes.  That means you need to designate gateway routers, and all of the clients behind them must be doing so as well if they are to be globally reachable.  This is _the_ unsolved issue with making a scalable mesh network.

Which brings up another point: is it a design goal of this project that all nodes should be reachable form all other nodes?  Or do you want to have large nodes that hand out addresses that are NATed?  This makes a huge difference.  It creates points of failure but also reduces complexity.  It's something that needs to be decided on

When networks scale

The Internet/ARPANET solved some of these issues, or they can cause a lot of problems for everyone else.  These nodes must control their down streams to some extent to limit problems.  Is that the way to do it for a darknet?  Probably not.  So some real routing/addressing/protocol decisions followed by engineering will have to be done, and some real decisions about what capabilities are critical must-haves and which can be left out needs to occur.

Without a working plan and consensus on the standard protocol suite for this

So that's that.  If this very mundane, tedious task is not completed, no amount of wireless gear, DNS servers and content servers will ever be available to the scale of audience you seem to want to reach.  No end user gear can be chosen, as you don't even know what protocols it will need to run yet.  You don't even know if the end user gear will be different from an upstream node (hint: it will have to be for any sort of scale or it won't have enough RAM to track an address table large enough for any sort of scaling).

This is going to be a knock down argument against the meshnet plan

ARGUMENT THE FIRST

One of the principle arguments for the meshnet (and against simply making a darknet over the Internet) is that we don't control the Internet

However, whenever they want.  Second, governments can control the wireless spectrum.  If they choose to shut it down, they can.  

So

ARGUMENT THE SECOND

This project is for white geeks living in cities in North America and maybe Europe.  It's biggest proponents admit intercity communication is a problem with no apparent solution.  The meshnet will never grow in Asia or in countries already experiencing significant pressure by governments over wireless frequencies.  

If you think otherwise, who can't afford a wifi router in the first place, will be able to setup a network while the government is waging a civil war.

It seems the /r/darknetplan need not apply to the largest countries in the world

ARGUMENT THE THIRD

Darknet logic is so very clearly different from meshnet logic.  Darknet logic asks how we can make Internet traffic more secure

This is technology survivalism

But more than that, we should worry about more and more Internet.  More piled on top of more, until the very pores of our skin sing in TCP/IP.  That is the direction the real world is going.

If you're concerned about oppressed countries like Syria

SUMMARY

1. Meshnet is not secure against attacks by hostile governments.

2. Meshnet will not scale globally

3. Meshnet survivalism ignores the fact that we're 99% more likely to experience more Internet

I'm just going to leave it at that.  I can't imagine I need to say more.

TO THE OP'S QUESTION

If the Internet shut off, we can assume the government has also shut down, or is closely observing all electronic communications.  And so I offer the following solutions.

SOLUTION ONE: COURIERS
If you need to transmit a *large* amount of data

SOLUTION TWO: SECRET MEETINGS
If you need to coordination action during a time of crisis, and harddrives.  Repeat this to circulate materials in time across a city, region, nation.  

But

SOLUTION THREE: USE EVERY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION AVAILABLE

Radio, cell phones, writing letters, using drones as carrier pigeons, Morse code, smoke signals?  Wait a week and the Internet will be back.

So the real solution to the problem is not more Internet --OR *ANOTHER* INTERNET!  It is maintaining a social network that can securely transmit messages through alternate systems of communication.  

Meshnet is a joke and a waste of time.

Edit: I can't help myself.

**The reason we all should be pissed off** /r/darknetplan has been taken over by true believers in the CJDNS and the mesh net, darknet software serves the billions currently connected to the Internet.  Whereas the meshnet will solve all our problems when t=infinity, darknet solutions are solving our problems today.

But instead of spending time thinking about the darknet

**The alpha and omega of mesh nets.**  Free wireless networks in big cities are a well established culture.  Meshnet must have come out of some geek's observation that city wide wireless coverage could be turned into city-wide meshnets.  So far so good.  

But how many cities actually boast city-wide coverage?  No

So now you have your Meshnet, walkie-talkie's and so forth.  Who's going to use it?  Are these 20 geeks going to use it to play an awesome game of Quake [3] Arena?  No, they're going to totally overthrow this oppressive government, that's what!  They're going to throw it open to the revolution!

Meshnet opens up to the masses.  Meshnet admins sit at their consoles eating Cheetos awaiting the great deluge.  Oh, so you can't find it.  (We'll forget for the moment how the intellience services have already tracked down an eliminated the Meshnet based on their clearnet web page boasting about how awesome they are.)  So how do people find it?  They don't.

Okay forget about that.  Somehow everybody learns where to go to get on the Meshnet.  Now everybody is there.  People are ... doing what?  Not sending emails, no audio sharing.  Only text.  Okay fine, why not text during this revolutionary moment?  This is a revolution of ideas!

So Meshnet is a bulletin board and private message system for the revolution.  Great.  Could it make a difference?  As soon as it starts making a difference,False,self,t5_2rju2,False,,,t3_14moui

 I will not go into too much detail because I hope to be releasing it at a talk during ToorCon 14; must pray to the CFP selection gods. 

I was going to be bringing the rough alpha unit and showing it at DefCon 20 this year

A major change to the project is that DuskNet is no longer a single unit but a solution to provide a rapid deployable darknet that allows people to BYOD and start utilizing the system

First time post on this sub-reddit and look forward to becoming more involved.

I came up with an idea just a few days ago and have been trying to work on it in my free time (whenever that is). My idea is building a mobile “dark net base station” that has a multitude of wireless technologies within it that utilized open source encryption algorithms and authentication methods.
The idea is to have a base station that can mesh with other smaller or larger base stations. 

A quick background on me to see where I am coming from with my building of this device. I would like to think that I am not one of those guys that just come up with ideas that I can never build. I am a communications/security engineer with a focus with radio communications; so building a mobile base station is no big problem (An engineer’s famous last words). 
Being most familiar with commercial cellular networks
The basic hardware and software needed can be seen in the image below. 

http://imgur.com/8UyIJ

This is setup could be used in a case like Egypt where the government tried to shut down the internet and other communications as a portable deployable dark net; where people can use their computers and cellular phones. 
I plan on having a PoC unit up and going at DefCon 20 (if I can get my E-STA from the FCC before then). 
I have called this project the Dusk Net (since you can see spectrum use with any basic energy detention spectrum analyzer) since it can never be a totally hidden network but also not available to everyone; it is the twilight in-between the two. 

I know this was a quick and dirty intro for something that I could spend a huge amount of time talking about this

I just want to know what you guys thinks

One last thing: I understand that this would require using bands that one has to pay to use by the FCC and other organizations if you are outside the US. With that said in a scenario like Egypt

Notes from IRC:

(1) I have not picked an official area to be at a DefCon 20 (Thoughts)

(2) If you guys have any gear that you would like to have integrated

(3) Dan68 is helpful when it comes to tried and true WiFi hardware 

(4) Looking at the CJDNS project (may not be able to integrate before DefCon... No time)

Again according to HowStuffWorks, to lift a simple RPi hub. Simply attach a bundle of 10 or so balloons (for redundancy) to the hub, and attach that to a 100+ foot long rope, and anchor the other end to the ground. Congratulations, you have an easy long-range omnidirectional antenna!

Total cost:

* $50 [Helium tank](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Balloon-Time-Helium-Tank-Fills-50-Balloons/14101103)
* $35 RPi model B (when model A comes out
* $10 dongle
* $10 100 ft rope
* $1 Balloons from dollar store
* $1 Balloon string from dollar store

= $107 total.

Of course, though it's important to remember that without a solid tower, the wind *will* play with your toys, and this setup will not be suited for windy climates. Also, for simplicity's sake, use a basket of some kind to carry your hardware, instead of tying things directly on to it

To get an idea how far your router can stray if it goes down or gets blown around, and the red area (or, intersection) is the area where the balloon has free reign to get tossed around. Make sure there are no power lines in your red area, that gets bad fast.

Thoughts?

**EDIT TO SUMMARIZE RESPONSES SO FAR:**

* Use hydrogen, since the whole thing will basically explode anyways if the the current is not properly grounded and routed around the balloons.
* Rope weight. You have to compensate for rope weight
* You're often better served by using a single, they can last for years.
* When the weather is bad, play it smart.
* Maintenance. It's easy to get one of these up in the air, and replace batteries. If you do wireless this way, you're going to have to accept those as the terms of the deal.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/q4l3e/tethered_balloon_stations/

1321841608.0,mjn12,"Everyone - this is the big picture. Please read and discuss. It isn't as simple as ""make wireless meshes"".",mzinz,109,20,50,"Let me begin by saying that I am a network engineer by profession. I deal with public peering and transit on a daily basis. As I see continued discussion on both Reddit and IRC

1. DarkNET

Before I get into technical details, geographically distributed network that allows end-users (us) to communicate without reliance on corporations. 

The thing is, if we are are unable to access any content on the internet from this network, we will not receive enough support and participation on this project. The incentive isn't going to be there. This is a massive project and is going to require a lot of professional participation, organization, leadership, and time, and you aren't going to get tens of thousands of people working on a network that doesn't have any content on it at all.  What is the point of connecting with someone, over this alternative network if the internet still works fine? It's just not going to happen.  Alternatively, at least.

The point that I'm really illustrating here is the necessity for some sort of backbone. A network backbone, providing a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks"". The backbone will connect the local wireless meshes to one-another, and also provide a high speed path to the public internet. Accomplishing this project with wireless meshes alone is not feasible. Wireless technology has gotten good, but it will simply not accomplish what we want. 

2. So now we need a backbone? How would that work?
Essentially, thus becoming a piece of the internet backbone. Now - before everyone says, ""Wait, I thought the whole point of this project was to DISCONNECT ourselves from the internet?"", understand that having a path doesn't make us reliant on the internet, are have to abide by the same rules that corporations do (or possibly could if SOPA and similar bills pass). This is merely a ""fat pipe"" that would connect us to the internet. Additionally, using the internet backbone will allow our local wireless meshes to connect to each other. 

There really is no other option when this project is in its infancy. That being said, and have dedicated connections between our backbone devices. This would remove any remaining reliance from the internet (since we could traverse our own transit links as opposed to the networks we are peering with). 

A lot of people on the subreddit seem to think that using any cabling, but it doesn't at all - reliance on corporations does.

3. This all sounds kinda expensive!
Yeah. It is. Well, our equipment will need to also.  Honestly, one of the most expensive parts of this whole thing is the wireless. We some how have to connect our local wireless meshes to our backbone. This would mean that those who are geographically nearby to the DarkNET points of presence will need to also connect to the points of presence via wifi, thus providing a path from the local mesh to the backbone. Wireless shit isn't cheap. 

In the beginning, but it's another lengthy topic, so for now just know that we will connect our local meshes to our backbone using our existing internet service providers as a pathway. We won't have to abide by their rules or regulations, and our traffic would all be encrypted, but we still need them when we start out.

4. So how do we actually get started on this project?
Unfortunately, but rather, trying to highlight the fact that we need a huge amount of resources and participation to make this work.  It isn't just network engineers and developers, we will need tons of roles to be filled. I mean, people coordinating upgrade projects, teams assigned to geographic locations, massive amounts of documentation… everything that an ISP would need

Speaking of which, our own connections to the home via wireless, everything. It's actually really awesome.

I've been thinking about how we should proceed with this subreddit and the plan in general. 

The first thing I have to say is about my own role in the subreddit. I am no technical expert and have no guiding vision for this plan. As a moderator

Next, let me know.

The next step is making everything accessible. This is a job for those tech geniuses on the subreddit. Improving the wiki so that even tech impaired people can understand at least the basics will help our cause greatly.

Then we have the actual plan. We have a million ideas thrown out there right now, will be accessible to an almost average person so that we actually have a chance of getting things done. This means we need to stop squabbling about the ideas and come to a decision as a subreddit some time very soon.

How can we accomplish all this?

From now on

Community Organizers: These people will be dedicated to organizing both local and online events to bring attention to our cause and to help carry out the plan as determined by the more technical members of our group. This is a larger task than it seems

Tech Gurus: This is possibly the biggest thing we need right now. If you have experience with networking (please state your experience in your post) and have ideas on how we should proceed from a technical standpoint and have the time to actually do planning

Map managers: We need a main person to create a map and a few people to moderate it. If someone with coding experience could use the google maps api to create a map in which a person can mark their general location and then have each person be contactable via email without displaying the email address itself. 

Darknet Leaders: These people will be responsible for making the community and technology aspects come together. Basically if you're applying for this position you need networking AND leadership experience in order for things to go smoothly. The group leaders will be responsible for making sure everything runs smoothly.


So these are my ideas on getting things a little more organized. Input is encouraged

The project is called Tavern







The basic structure is built around exchanging GPG-signed JSON strings. Your GPG key becomes your base identity, and it'll start downloading them automatically.

Messages can be exchanged either node-&gt;node, you can do machine-&gt;machine relay, and form an effective message-based meshnet, without needing a persistent end-to-end connection.

The message-based design also lets you relay messages on a phone or USB stick

The system works - I have a UI, as well as choosing your own moderators - It works reasonably well so far, but I know there's a lot more to do.

As mentioned on the site, so I had to post to Postgresql, but it lets me sell an easy to use plug-and-play version that my father could run at home easily.  For a network like this to work, I think it's critical to make it easy enough for anyone, even my Dad, to quickly and easily get it running.

I'll attempt to neutrally and briefly describe what I posted, ask you if this is appropriate content. What I posted is described by this:

1. A documentary exists that was uploaded to YouTube. Its content appears to be rare, as evidenced by blog posts urging interested partied to ""watch it while you can"".

2. The documentary was removed from YouTube due to copyright claims. It is hard to find elsewhere on the open internet.

3. I located the documentary on I2P, though I2P is also built around anonymity and directly supports file sharing.

4. I thought that access to the documentary would encourage users to try I2P and learn more about decentralized networks

My post on /r/darknetplan accrued 131/13 votes in an hour or two, and anonymity. As of the time of this post, there were no comments saying it was off-topic or didn't belong.

**Goals - from the highest level down.**

From a bird's-eye view

And what's needed to hit such a lofty goal?

**Users**

Above and beyond all else, and everyone uses it, we win.

Right now, gives the impression of only being interesting to people who are deeply suspicious of the governments of the world.

Now, more responsible and more competent government - BUT I think anyone who reads newspapers and history books should have every reason to be aware of the fact that governments in the past and present have at times been extremely destructive to their own citizens and that being suspicious of them is quite rational.

Nevertheless

We can't lose focus on the underlying idea of an out-of-control network!  But we also have to realize that in order to get the huge adoption that we need for a Big Win

We need that huge adoption, and can only use a small subset of possible contributors.  In order to attract more developers, we need to make it _accessible_ to a wide range of developers, we need to make it _fun_, FFS!, and ideally if we could make it _educational_ we could get a lot of resources from the educational systems of the world.

And to attract both developers and end-users, network agnostic, as I wrote in my previous article.  It's not just that it makes the system more accessible to all, but that it makes it _simpler._  The work hasn't vanished, of course, it's moved into the specific implementations of parts, but it makes it much easier for experts on a platform, or a technology like authentication or network discovery

Finally, or any operation that runs on an individual machine with time complexity of greater than O(log(N)), where N is the number of nodes in the network.

**Non-goals?**

Lots of lofty goals

A classic engineering motto says:  ""[Good

Let's start with ""efficiency"" - in compacting messages, entertaining, out-of-control - and our basic idea is that we're passing around fairly small items with high intrinsic value.

So efficiency is a non-goal.  Of course, but we don't have to write everything in optimized C++ (not that I don't love C++ but it's a lot of work!) and we don't have to make our protocol super-compressed (and for any real compression, we'd simply rely on external tools like zip, gzip, bz2, .ogg, .flac etc...)

What about reliability?  Yes, who wants buggy software?  Well, the underlying system of course has to work well, but if you look at many of the transport mechanisms already proposed, they all come with a greater and lesser degree of reliability already.  And we also need to make the system span to even nodes that are not fully reliable.

We need to embrace and control unreliability

And what about user interface?  Well, but I think _specifying_ a user interface should also be a non-goal of the core project.  Everything we in the core group create for GUI should be merely thought of as a placeholder for the real interface - because people love writing user-interface code :-D and we might as well take advantage of that.


**A development plan

**1. Services.**

So far, has either been on an abstract level or been specific on bottom-up details of the technology.

But let's get back to your average guy

We need to define a set of fairly specific _services_ that this system will be offering.  We need to tell people what they should expect to get if they and their friends set up some Darknet node.

When I say we, they won't adopt the system when it's done.

Ideas for specific services could be expressed as [user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) - short


The deliverable here is a general agreement on a prioritized list of user stories describing what services we hope to get.


**2. Structures.**

At this point, of specific requests for things like ""discovery"".

This is a key stage.  We need to keep this as light

We still haven't written any code or put together any hardware - these are abstract data structures that we'll implement in one or more languages later.


The deliverable here is a document or set of documents specifically describing down to the individual fields the programming data structures and network protocols we're planning to use.  Of course, because the costs of later changes in this spot might be great.


**3. Sample.**

Now we need to go away and write a bunch of code - hopefully not so much code if we've been careful in steps 1 and 2.

Tnese will have actual implementations of the data structures first - and then implementations of the services

I'm going to strongly suggest Python for this task, is easy for beginners to pick up, and is one that I personally know well.  :-D


Deliverable:  a toy system that has all the parts we designed in part 2


**4. Standard.**

We have some excitement

To do that

This would require some sort of hardware.  For this release (and for time to come!) this has to be completely off-the-shelf stuff - for example

And there need to be software implementations of the services.

Now

At this point, and then immediately start coding extensions to it by plugging in more hardware or editing specific files we point them to.  This is how almost everyone develops, starts with a working system and then modifies it, and we should make this as easy as possible.


**5. System.**

Note that we still don't have a user interface!  But that's step 5

There's a reasonable quantity of drudgery here, we probably have a lot of help.  The really hard part is getting to step 4...

**Edit:** I'm not getting much in the way of ""how this could actually work"" so I'll add a starting point...


Lets start with a high level design

In my mind, no reason that it shouldn't look similar.

 * Starting at the client, and it's main jobs are to merely get to the next role device and to extend the mesh.

 * The next role up the chain would be an ""access role"". The client devices should start to aggregate here, and potentially would have some mechanism to extend the mesh range (think repeater).

 * The access roles would then feed up to an ""edge role"". This is where many of the local ""pods"" all interconnect and should be the device that handles routing to the rest of the world. This device shouldn't necessarily be responsible for extending the mesh

 * The edge devices should then connect to some ""core role"" devices that are responsible for shortening paths

 * Maybe we can add some sort of ""aggregation role"" (think IXP)

Great, small devices cannot hold large routing tables, consumer grade electronics doing consumer grade things, etc.  Sounds like a great opportunity to help push for ipv6. 


Okay, take away from, etc. Lets get a design down and then we can start working on what we could use to fill each role and get this moving.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mqal1/so_whats_the_plan_here/

1327527896.0,owm9i,"A simplified explanation of cjdns, and how you can help with Project Meshnet, even with little techincal knowledge.",,90,54

Looking around the subreddit, and how to get it up and running. I'd like to address some of those issues here today with a brief rundown of what cjdns does (in as close to layman terms as possible), why it's important to get nodes up and running (and how), and how it can potentially be applied to a physical mesh network.

**Why is cjdns important to Project Meshnet?**

As we all know the goal of Project Meshnet is to create a nation/worldwide network seperate from the internet we know today to combat censorship and centralized network control. To acheive this, we don't have the hardware to just put that kind of infrastructure into place, so we have to start somewhere.

This is where cjdns comes in. It allows us to create a virtual network inside of our existing network. The cool thing about it is

*Advantages:*

cjdns uses the new version of internet protocal (IP) addressing

Only cjdns nodes can connect to the sites and services available on the meshnet.

*Disadvantages:*

Only available on Linux and BSD (currently).

**Why is it important to get more cjdns nodes up and running?**

It is important to create more nodes so others can connect and expand the mesh. The biggest advantage to a mesh network is having nodes connected at multiple points for alternate routing. In a mesh network, you've cut of an entire block of the network. More nodes means more redundancy.

That's not the only reason more nodes are important though. Another major point is the ability to start bridging to local hardware. Once you have 1 node on a local network (let's say a home network featuring a wireless router) you could set up other devices on your local net to connect to your existing node without the need to connect to the internet. Furthermore, and have IPv6 capable hardware connect to the mesh without need for additional hardware (I will cover this in more detail in a minute).

*Getting on cjdns*

For those interested in getting a cjdns node up and running

[The github site for cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) contains step-by-step instructions for getting cjdns ready and connected. A more user-friendly guide can be found [here](http://projectmeshnet.org/threads/archlinux-pkgbuild-and-init-script-for-cjdns.12/) (Thanks Method320 for the link).

**The Meshnet Project can and WILL benefit from cjdns in the future**

This project can benefit so much from cjdns on many levels. Currently, it will bear little fruit.

If we can expand cjdns into MS Windows and Mac OSX, cjdns desperately needs a port to ARM based devices. With the abundance of Android smartphones on the market, having a revision of cjdns for ARM would allow for huge leaps in our efforts.

Additionally

**In conclusion, we need to be willing to learn new things and think in new ways to make it happen. Yes, it's been tough getting things going up to this point, but cjdns has provided what could be the biggest setting stone in the Meshnet. 

**TL;DR: There is no tl;dr. If you want to know more about cjdns and what it is/how it helps

This seems to be mostly from folks who are not hams in the first place and don't know or understand the restrictions that us ham radio ops have to live with. I'm not going to go into the entire FCC Chapter 47 Part 97 rules us American hams use as there are only a few key items relevant to MeshNet. You can find the FCC Part 97 rules in its entirety [here](http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_10/47cfr97_10.html) and alternatively at the [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/part-97-amateur-radio) for additional reading.

As stated in [Part 97 subsection 113](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/octqtr/47cfr97.113.htm) we're prohibited from relaying traffic from non-ham stations and engaging in regular communications that are better suited for other radio services. The former is self explanatory, unless its a life or death emergency we're not allowed to relay traffic from unlicensed users which is the big killer for ham radio in the MeshNet.

Now in the case we're not connecting wirelessly to ham control mesh nodes without a license and instead are connected by VPN to a computer linked to the mesh node we're still subject to [Part 97 subsection 219](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/octqtr/47cfr97.219.htm) which governs message forwarding. This states that we have to be able to identify the origins of the traffic to ensure its legal on the ham bands (ie Ham traffic) and if we cannot id the traffic that we must accept responsibility for it. This means if there's traffic from unlicensed users we're responsible to block said traffic otherwise we risk losing our license.

Assuming the Meshnet is made up of devices connected to each other wirelessly (some wired?) and almost all of them act as nodes that transport messages and can act as an access point

If there are no satellites for the Meshnet (or the ones that do transport Meshnet packets have been taken over by tyrannical governments)

I also doubt that packets would end up touching every single node physically placed along the way. Messages can travel at nearly the speed of light

There is another point to consider: censors/filters/great firewalls are often easily circumvented by taking an alternative route for your network messages. In high school

If you are able to explicitly tell the network to take your packet in a different direction across the world, I can instead have the message travel across Greenland, hop over to Iceland, and have it hopefully reach the United Kingdom (probably not likely...), then have it travel across Europe and Asia. Or maybe across Antarctica (highly unlikely), assuming sufficient wireless range.

Finally, for free (ignoring the actual costs of radio devices).

Encoding data in to words is nothing new

[Mnemonic encoder](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109230247/http://www.tothink.com/mnemonic/) is an encoding scheme that can encode 32 bits of data in to three distinct words. The original page is long gone but thanks to [the internet archive](http://archive.org) the data lives on.

To be clear

The test project involves a simple file-sharing program that can advertise its availability

I've looked into two methods of doing this. 

The first method involves putting the interfaces in monitor mode and using packet sniffing and injection to receive and send data. By injecting forged broadcast data packets, as far as I can tell, while still using the hardware available. 

This method gives nearly absolute control over the implementation of protocols

There are several disadvantages of this method: it requires packet handling logic to be programmed in software

The second method involves using the ad-hoc 802.11 mode. The clients automatically join a particular network and take a random IP address of the form 10.X.X.X. The the TCP/IP machinery can be used to do broadcasts and connections as usual. This can be made anonymous if the wireless driver allows modification of the hardware address (this is trivial in linux

The advantage of this method is simplicity of implementation - the socket API is well known

I've implemented both systems (in linux) and can provide code (python) to anyone who's interested. 

EDIT: I'm doing some more work on method #2 right now - I'm trying to create a file system (using fuse on linux) that will automatically create directories for detected peer's shared files.

(from IRC)

I couldn’t agree more!
Have you seen the side bar &gt;&gt; ? It is longer that the 25 posts on subreddit itself.

To begin with.
There are three EFnet channels:

* #cjdns
* #hyperboria
* #projectmeshnet

Most of the people on the IRC are on all of the channels.
All questions can be answered by any of those people. 
Pointing someone to the right channel doesn’t happen often because it is pointless.
And even if we where are going to point users to the right channel it will become a threshold for new people to join the IRC.

Then there is HypeIRC which has a #hyperboria channel of its own.
In my opinion this should not be any in-depth discussions here. We could use EFnet for that. That way more people read it.
We can however keep using #hyperoria@HypeIRC like the ´living room´ for HypeIRC. You join here and chat about Hypeboria sites or anything else.

A list of Project Meshnet related subreddits

* /r/darknetplan
* /r/hyperboria
* /r/darknetplanHW
* /r/dorknet
* /r/MeshnetNews
* /r/Meshnet
* /r/DarkNetPlanOverflow
* /r/Hocnet

This is getting ridiculous.

What is wrong with just /r/darknetplan?
It is the only subreddit with a decent amount of subscribers. We want 1.000.000 subscribers to /r/darknetplan. Not 10 subscribers to 100.000 Subreddits.
Imagine you are new to the project

Then there are the quadrillion meshlocal subreddits with not a lot of subscribers to any of them.
Why not just use one meshlocal subreddit and share! meshlocal related issues. This way we could learn from each other.
It also has the same problem mentioned above. We could just add [Location] prefixes to titles in the subreddit to make it easier to localize certain posts.

IMHO it should look something along the lines of this:

* IRC
* - #cjdns (Hyperboria == cjdns network
* - #projectmeshnet
* HypeIRC
* -  #Hyperboria
* - ~ Any Hyperboria only services channel, #uppit
* Reddit
* - /r/darknetplan
* - /r/Meshlocal

And that is it.
We could do with a lot less

And what about infrastructure? WiFi will never be able to handle networks in very high density areas even with perfect traffic management the commons of the spectrum is simply too small for everyone. The solution would be wires or IR links to get traffic out of the WiFi spectrum at least until it can leave crowded areas. But that equipment is expensive and the time to maintain it not insignificant. Helping out the network may be good karma

Both of these problems could cripple Meshnet by making it impossible for it to grow into a truly ubiquitous network without degrading to uselessness. The solution to both of them is simple, so that the Redditor can pay top dollar to see that important cat picture instead of delivering the businessman's email about his 3rd meeting today. By selling bandwidth those who provide services in areas where they are needed are rewarded, instead of just karma people who directly help the network are paid for their trouble, cables and IR links, previously a burden, could employ millions. As the new infrastructure lowered the network load in an area bandwidth prices would fall back to near zero at peak times.

I think that the only way for a truly free and open Internet is through meshnet technology. A meshnet is a versatile, to implement this nationwide existing infrastructure has to be used and maintained and that costs money. What I suggest is that people pay for the amount of data they use and get paid for the amount of data that uses their infrastructure. That way current internet providers still get money and it allows for more competition. Imagine a local coffee house that offers free wifi getting paid for offering free WiFi. Instead of a few ISPs(Time Warner, Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T) getting paid to offer Internet there would be potentially millions. In order for the pay system to work there would have to be some entity that keeps track of how much you use and transmit (though not what you use and transmit) and pays/charges you accordingly. Both the big ISPs and individuals would use the same pay system.

There is a lot of issues

I've also made a project on ClockingIt to help manage our time and milestones. I'm not very familiar with it so it might not be exactly what we want. I'm a web app developer so I can make any tools we need that way and have them open-source as well. I'm not sure how to add users to it
[Global MeshNet on ClockingIt](http://global-meshnet.clockingit.com)

Here is what we need to start figuring out when the project starts (or whenever you want and in no particular order):

* We need a way of identifying uniquely with different computers (IPv6) ?
* There has to be a way of establishing a DNS of some sort.
* Everything must be in an encrypted protocol.
* Some mathematical equations to determine the fastest route between peers with minimal overhead.
* How people can make their own homebrew or pre-made access points.
* Require a minimum of signal connectivity to connect into the Global MeshNet (to help with reliability and prevent flaky hardware)
* Setup a way of sharing the idea and mapping out potential peers that want to contribute
* Try looking into using the power grid to connect MeshNets (like Broadband over Powerline BPL) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication
* Setup a mechanism to prevent abuse (this will be a feat)

As for my own personal ideas, but fuck them, it's **our** money damn it). I'd probably have to setup a bank account for it, but I want to make sure everyone can see where their money is going.

We will need:

* Dreamers
* Testers
* Organizers

Just think about how much that country would benefit right now if it had set up a wireless ad hoc darknet.


Part of me thinks that a WiFi based darknet will never happen. Eventually satellites are going to be cheap enough to build and launch that hackerspaces will be able to pool together funds to launch one and use it for communication. Once you have a couple satellites you no longer have to worry about users being spread out all over the country. I think this will happen before we are able to build a darknet with enough nodes to actually be useful. 

You can already launch a HAM relay station into orbit for a mere $8000

Because I have a residential ISP and it may violate my terms of service and quickly overwhelm my ISP connection, Wikimedia, IRC, Teamspeak, and web sites that provide information about local businesses and organisation, as well as other services. This constitutes some slight usefulness to its users, but not a whole lot. 

So the plan is to create a node by setting up an access point and provide some web based services. The future goal would be to interconnect with other nodes and bridge and/or interlink services. A second access point device that is more specialised to be a 'client bridge' would be able to shoot a few miles to a distant client bridge connecting nodes.

Without further ado

* Anonymity. This is a big ticket item, freenet, or any of their friends. Cjdns happens to, as a side effect, not reveal your IP address directly to users of a service or to providers of a service, other than your cjdns address. This is not anonymity, and treating it as such can only hurt you. Your node is identifiable based on the path taken to it, i2p fits the bill
* Name service. While we may some fine day have this, however that's very much a hack. This is an important item, as cjdns' man in the middle protection relies on you being able to check a public key against an address, and if the address can be replaced with another (by man in the middling your name service), then your whole session can be intercepted. In i2p this is handled with what basically amounts to a hosts file for the .i2p domain space, and all of the major darknet, meshing, though not very popular at the moment.
* Persistence. When your cjdns instance is offline, but I feel it's important to mention. Cjdns routes packets, it does not host sites of any kind without you running some server software behind it. If you're looking for that sort of thing, the answer is Freenet.
* A gateway. Cjdns will not under any condition take you out to the internet. It can route you to a proxy, and non-cjdns packets will be dropped by cjdroute unconditionally. If you want to surf the open web anonymously, you're looking for Tor.


With that being said

* No central authority. Cjdns addresses are not allocated or pooled, nor in fact any software needed to run the entire network except for the same daemon all the peers run.
* Actual IP addresses, and services are hosted using a normal network stack, without the use of proxies or gateways.
* Non-homogeny. Cjdns is designed to work on mixed networks with very flexible operational parameters. Cjdns provides its own link-layer protocol effectively, or on 802.11.
* End-to-end encryption. This is very important to any system
* Point-to-point encryption. This is less critical, look like random noise, with no identifying pattern other than the UDP port the traffic is sent on.
* End-to-end signatures and node identity confirmation. This is somewhat special, forward and back, no matter the carried protocol. If you have the correct cjdns address for a host, it is not possible to inject packets into the stream, as each end will simply see a bad signature, and drop the injected packets.

Some points are also relevant to discussion

* &lt;other software&gt; uses Java!

Yes, can be done well, or done poorly. This is not an argument against either i2p or freenet.

* &lt;software&gt; is so much better than &lt;other software&gt;!

Facts, simple VPN software, cjdns, i2p, tor, and freenet could all live in harmony on the same machine, doing cool stuff like adding some cjdns peers over i2p.


* TL;DR: cjdns is not tor, and freenet doesn't route.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,1346485203.0,,

&gt;Lately I have been doing a fair amount of research into building your own router out of hardware like Micro ATX boards with atom and similar cpu's built in. I do not know if this fits here exactly, in which case, I think you would need to buy expensive multi-port NICs, and by extension, bust the budget and render this pretty much useless due to costs.
&gt;
&gt;This seems like it would be better than most (if not all) consumer routers out today. I figure this could cost from free to less than $350 (buying all new ""high end"" parts).
&gt;
&gt;I figure this would be much better than just buying a plastic box for several reasons. One
&gt;
&gt;So as I said above, out of the box with little or no additional drivers or configurations required, if you are buying hardware for a certain OS, why not make sure it works great for your application?

**A tale of two systems**

A wifi network is not the same as Mesh. One of the biggest headaches when it comes to meshnet is the fact that it encompasses two distinct systems that use the same damn terminology (this isn’t Mesh’s fault). 
The first system is the mesh/internet (the meshnet) this is the thing that will give you website pages this is “The Internet” and I mean that most literally
The second system is the ability to access mesh (the wireless portion of mesh)

I will be referring to the Mesh-internet as “The Meshnet” and the wireless access grid as “The WAG”; I was going to go with WiMesh or Meshfi but I really wanted to have two completely different names for the purpose of this conversation.
The WAG has always existed. The WAG is 3g

**This is not a mesh system**. At this point we may as well start drawing lines and jumping on sides because the first thing you should say is “Didn’t you just describe that as a mesh system”? The short answer is no

It is true that just about any system is a network/mesh/web of interconnected things. Look at [Diagram #1]( http://i.imgur.com/JKvg7.jpg). This diagram represents a wifi grid. Each black dot is a router that does not have internet access and each red dot is a router that does have internet access. You are the blue dot.  As a blue dot you are looking to access the internet

In this system there is a DEFINED GOAL. And NONE of the dots hold any unique value. They either provide internet or they do not. That is it. All of the black dots function the same way. All of the red dots function the same way. If a new node is created the nodes around it will adjust

**That’s a WAG

Now

Shit just got real – all I want to do is get the address of the closest Chinese restaurant. As odd as it may sound this is a really freaking complicated request to sort out in a distributed system. I’ll make it super easy for you; U, but I don’t know how to find it. If I’m connected to point A how many nodes will I pass through to reach T? The answer is ALL OF THEM. I don’t know what direction to start so the only way to solve this problem is to build a path-finder (aka super fun exponential time) – say there is an average of 4 connections to each node, if the two nodes are more than 5 hops I’ll have jumped through 1,024 nodes. After 8 hops I’ll have traversed 65k nodes. Ten hops is more than a million. Twelve hops is sixteen million. 18 hops is 68 billion… and so on…  

This is what people mean when they talk about scalability. The WAG does not have this issue. The WAG simply looks for internet (are you a red circle?) Once the WAG has found that it KEEPS it. The WAG has to make hops but it only has to do it when something goes down. The Mesh is making hops ALL THE TIME. Where’s that Chinese restaurant again? Oh wait I actually feel like Thai. Maybe I should get a movie
  
**Thanks**  
That’s all I wanted to say. I hope this helps someone. I know that was quite a bit to ram through and I hope someone clever’er than I can summarize / critique / tldr / refute my points as I would enjoy the learning experience.

1335025168.0,sldwm,Decentralized DNS idea,Kancho_Ninja,56,8,50,"I know enough about networking to be moderately dangerous

Question #1 - Why are you even sticking with DNS? If you're going to rewrite the book

Question #2 - If you're going to decentralize the name servers

example:

I have a darknet server. I call it ""Darkmass.dom"" (.dom for domain) and want to register it so I can receive and pass traffic. Heck

So I generate a domain key and sign it.  Then I  email it to a friend that has darknet server. He signs my key and sends it back.  I install the key, Repeat.

So how does this solve the domain name issue?  Keys.  The keys contain the domain name and trust. Darknet servers pass keys between each other

So Joe Citizen connects to the darknet

Read about FIDOnet and PGP key signing to get the concept I'm suggesting.  You don't need centralized domain servers - all you need is servers that trust each other and keep a list of trusted keys.  If you determine that ""MIB.dom"" is a bad site


Was I coherent?

edit: I guess what I'm trying to explain is that you would use special software to run a darknet server. That software would include a type of DNS server that passes keys back and forth between the servers.  It would update the location of the server, but perhaps that can be worked around. It was easy enough in the BBS days, the phone number was the key and the name of the BBS was just advertising.",,False,self,t5_2rju2,,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/sldwm/decentralized_dns_idea/

H.265 compression has huge potential to save bandwidth for images and videos used on the internet. VP9 could also have big potential here. With up to 5x reduction compared to jpeg with little noticeable image loss

With these compression technologies
Obviously not with 'data' but with loading times of websites

Data can also be compressed much much better than LZMA with Paq8.

Since the business is internet infrastructure

*Scenario 1* - Large ISP

My initial idea is to purchase an internet connection for resale from one of the local providers

Adding more coverage would basically be the process over again. One could probably get away with delivering routers quite a distance outside of the station coverage as well

In Oslo, a private 5/0.5 Mbps connection from the biggest ISP ([Telenor](http://translate.google.no/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telenor.no%2Fprivat%2Fbredband%2F)) costs about $50/month, while a 1 Gbps fiber connection for resale costs about $1000-1500/month. Now, if we split the fiber connection on 200 customers, they would all get a minimum of 5/5 Mbps out on the internet, for a cost of ~$5 each.

Customers would also benefit from communication between each other

Calculate in a monthly cost of maintenance and hardware for each user

(My calculations are rough

*Scenario 2* - Neighborhood ISP

Let's forget delivering to a massive area

In terms of both scenarios:

* Is anything I've stated bullshit?
* Is it viable?
* What kind of equipment would be needed?
* Is current wireless technologies sufficient?
* Is CJDNS right technology? Commotion Wireless?

I wrote this lengthy paper outlining my ideas on the operation of a truly anonymous network. Basically what we do is arrange a bunch of nodes in a P2P network

We store the information about hidden services and peers on the network using a distributed hash table (not like tor on one server). We also make it possible to open ""remote listening sockets"" through which others can connect to our peer without knowing it's location. And then we have a full blown system for: hidden services
 
This paper also brings up some ideas on using PGP on social networks for cool effects such as easy way to ""search"" for posts by some speciffic user id (posts which are signed with public keys for integrity control and distributed all over in the p2p network). And also some other things. Check the paper.

1354446966.0,145bfg,A question for you all in the community ,boredshift,57,16,12,"Hello all in the Meshnet/Darknet community.
As some of you may have heard I released my [DuskNet project at ToorCon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrZWm3sd4Qs) this year

**Quick background:**
About 5 months ago I saw this community on reddit

The project has changed a little bit since then. DuskNet is the open source alternative to the “internet in a box” that deployed by other countries (US, Syria, etc). This box could also be used in a Meshnet community as a rapid response to if your local government shuts down or censors communication through devices like your laptop or cellular communication device. 

**Where I am at now:**
In my talk at ToorCon I talk about version 2.0 and what I have been working on with that. I have been jamming on that and have some good feedback from those who I have been testing the gear with. People are happy with it and like how much smaller it has become (without the SDR in it) and how much cheaper it is (case + main board + 3 radios = a little under 1000USD). 

**The impasse:**
Since this is an open source internet in a box solution I want to know what the meshnet / darknet community thinks will better everyone. I have 3 choices on a path I can go on. I am fine with all 3 paths



Path 1.

I start building/configuring the units on the cheap. I try to find the cheapest hardware that I can to build the DuskNet comms boxes with, etc.). The cases will be a little bigger and not as rugged but they would do. 

Path 2.

I start building/configuring the units to be as hardcore as I can. This means they will be more expensive but they will also kick 1000 times more ass then the first units. They will be tiny, but that testing cost a lot). They will have extreme capability and will have lower power consumption in comparison. These will be units would be a true work of art. 

Path 3.

Work on both. Yes I know everyone is going to say do this

Path 1 is more for the DIYer while Path 2 is more for the people who would be using it in other countries. 

**Full discloser:**

I am all for path 2 but I want to see if the larger meshnet / darknet community would be behind something like this. I am not looking at making a quick buck out of this, Path 1 will allow for more DIYers to have the setups in their hands to tinker with. 


**Summary:**
The DuskNet project is to replace the so called “internet in a box”, and it is meant to give people the ability to communicate when their government has taken that right away. Each node can be configured in a different way, but that is out of the scope of this post. 
DuskNets goal is simple

Look forward to what you all have to say.

For those of you who have questions as well please ask here and I will update first post if I think they are good. This will be updated with answers to the questions as well as more questions.

All answers get upvotes of thanks!

I'd have to say the first questions are the following:

.

**Does it always require hundreds of dollars of equipment to actually protect your privacy online?** If not

*If your just looking to protect your privacy online from corporations, AdBlock+ and PrivacyChoice TrackerBlocker &amp; you should be fine. If you want privacy, Tor is an excellent service. Proxies are also extremely useful for average (not high download/upload) browsing. Be careful though, as both proxies and TOR can see any passwords you use. However, If you're getting this impression about costs from the posts in this subreddit, you have it all wrong. The darknet project is about setting up an unregulated internet for the purpose of avoiding shutdown.*

.

**How not-private is my privacy online?** Should I be worried?

*It is really up to you to decide if you feel comfortable with every major company and the US Government tracking exactly what you do online. When your computer sends information outside your house/network, and see all the data that you have been sending and receiving. So, basically, you are always being watched.*

.

**Why is your privacy online so important to you?** I know you could just say

*Essentially, what they say &amp; how long they stay on a site. We have no way to stop it, but it would be nice to change that because most people would find the concepts of how we are being watched very creepy.*

.

**What got you interested in the subjects related to this subreddit?**

.

**What are some misconceptions about darknet and similar decentralized ISPs that we should consider?** I would hate to find out the misconceptions along the way through negative experiences.

*One should not call groups similar to darknet decentralized ISPs

.

**What are some important vocabulary pieces that we should get familiar with?** I'm talking about names/nicknames for specialized hardware or actions that the average person won't be familiar with.

*IP addresses, P2P, Mesh Networking, NLoS (near or non-line of sight), LoS (Line of Site), PtP (Point to Point) and PtMP (Point to MultiPoint).*

Supposing you commute once per day

What if a bunch of us got cheap APs with big HDs, and then any participating mobile unit could deliver that feed. Perhaps in exchange for a small fee paid in Bitcoin on delivery. Software could figure out based on where data consumers are and where mobile units typically travel, how to hand data around in multiple hops as needed to get it anywhere. 

Large corporations, bus stops, and airports could become hubs where mobile units would meet constantly to exchange payloads, much like a Fedex sorting facility. Mobile units could even travel through the mail and hand off data as they come within range of other mobile units.

Truckers, anyone who travels a lot could earn a little extra money just by having a mobile unit in his vehicle or on his person.

It could be built on the standard Usenet protocols, he would say ""I am interested in the feed xyz and I will pay 0.05 BTC"". Mobile unit would pass this request on to any other mobile units he encounters, or perhaps fulfill the request himself when he ""docks"" at the university/corporation wherever a big pipe is available. When the payload is delivered, mobile unit gets compensated.

An Internet backhaul is not strictly necessary of course, where they need to do large file transfers ""out of band"". Of course it might be used for warez but there are many other applications. For example if someone needs a huge upload capacity for video/photography work, or to do off-site backups.

1334089989.0,s348v,An Update on Project Meshnet,danry25,44,4,3,"Hey Redditors

The Seattle Meshnet Project was originally very much a separate organization that had a minor relationship with Project Meshnet, and we currently have a (mostly built) Open Street Maps tile server [here](http://badger.thefinn93.com/) that is available on hyperboria &amp; is going to form part of the backend for meshmaps.

On the topic of cjdns, one is that cjdns is vastly more complex than an algorithm such as BATMAN, the other is that cjdns has had comparatively very little actual research into the (routing) algorithm and how to make it function.""

If you think you can assist the cjdns devs

Besides those two topic above, but one thing that the community as a whole should consider is doing a kickstarter or a donation page to build Meshlocal starter kits, essentially it would be a set of 4 to 6 radios that Project Meshnet could mail off to a new Meshlocal, preconfigured to work with each other &amp; flashed to run OpenWRT + cjdns.

A meshlocal starter kit could look like this:

2 Nanostation M5 radios @ $85ea

2 Nanostation M2 radios @ $85ea

2 Nanostation M5 loco Radios @ $50ea

2 RB250G Gigabit Switches @$40ea

Total: $480

This buys at least 2 to 4 meshlocal nodes, and would help streamline the process of getting started. 

But, and as you might have noticed for a short while we reverted back to our default theme, from the Project Meshnet theme. The cause of most of this is due to a combination of Wolfeater being uninvolved in Project Meshnet &amp; making himself uncontactable over the past few months and Derp being an overzealous moderator and taking down Wolfeaters post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/rzp1s/thoughts_on_cispa_and_the_status_and_future_of/).

I'd hope they'd sort it out

Note: The above disclosure is almost assuredly tainted by my own opinions. Also, designing logos and administrating servers, Moderation skills are an area that need to be honed over a long period of time, by going through the learning stages of moderation, whereby you are over &amp; underzealous, and receive backlash for poor moderation. Only after that process can you be a good mod, and learn to back off when a post plays with your emotions &amp; ask another moderator to step in &amp; review said post.

&gt; The people who have developed these proposals are unfortunately limited in
their thinking. ISPs are unable to see past the now almost 30 year old routing
protocols which glue together the internet of today. Government actors are
conditioned to think of something as secure when they have control over it.
A quick look at x509 (the authentication system behind SSL) shows us that
central points of failure inevitably live up to their name. In order to have a
central authority
they must be able to trust his system's integrity as well. Recently people's
e-mail was compromised when DigiNotar certificate authority was hacked and used
to forge gmail certificates.

&gt; It is worthy of note that the vulnerability in DNS which ICE exploited to take
down websites they deemed ""dedicated to copyright infringement"" was also used
by Anonymous to replace a movie industry website with a manifesto.

I wanted to post some thoughts on this ideas in the hopes that I might be able to clear up some misconceptions.

I've been a licensed amateur radio operator for almost 18 years and have experience in most of the bands available on HF, but I am familiar with some of the laws that are discussed in this subreddit as well.

First

What you can do with ham radio:  You can experiment with the hobby and the design and making of communications circuits, volunteer to support outdoor events by providing communications, assist with communications efforts in disasters when other forms are not available, and enjoy any number of other challenging and fun facets of the hobby.

What you *cannot* do with ham radio:

* Expect to send encrypted

Planning to send encrypted text via a digital mode?  Send a binary file that is protected with a password?  Say ""the crow sleeps at midnight"" on the air with the knowledge that the receiving station knows this means you plan to meet them at the bar for lunch?  None of this is legal.  Anything you send over the air needs to be in the clear and *understood by anyone listening in that has knowledge and the equipment of the accepted mode of communication*.  There are some that think there might be loopholes around this

* Expect to send large amounts of data to a wide area.

Yes, nearly everyone types faster than these modes can send.

As you get to VHF and UHF frequencies, though, the coverage of the upper bands is dramatically decreased.  The higher you go in frequency, the more line-of-sight communications are.  Higher frequencies do not penetrate through walls as easily, are reflected, and above UHF you get to the point where the antennas have to be highly directional and must be in visible sight of each other to cover any real distance.

* Expect  communications to be reliable.

The reason so many hams enjoy the hobby is the unpredictable nature of the beast.  HF, sunspot cycle, atmospheric and weather conditions, and other unpredictable features.  Ionospheric skip (the method by which HF signals bounces off the upper levels of the atmosphere and make long distance communication possible) means I might be able to have a conversation easily with someone in Europe but not be readable by a friend just 70 miles away.  It also means that the clear conversation I am having with that station in Europe will suddenly end as conditions change from one minute to the next.

Frequencies above HF do not propagate through skip, to use 50 watts of power on 146MHz to talk to a friend the next town over, no matter day or night, sunspots, etc.  But I'll likely never get beyond that range unless through great luck of tropospheric ducting.

* Expect communication to be easy.

HF antennas can be easily made at home and very cheap, tune, use, and successfully utilize.

Again

There are networks of relay stations for digital communications

So

If short, cheap, fast, or reliable.  Drop by /r/amateurradio -- we're friendly, helpful, and would love to assist you with it!  If your desire is to circumvent imposed censorship, it is my opinion that you should *exclude radio except for consumer wifi and wifi bridging entirely from your plans*.

1320533753.0,m1tw4,Why not tor as a backbone?,,42,6,28,"Tor already works as a 'darknet' within the internet.  I know the idea of darknetplan is to make a brand new network outside of the internet without regulation

For those who don't know, from a chat server, email server, minecraft server, or a web page.  The way traffic in tor works is completely different from how tcp/ip works, in the sense that the traits which make it vulnerable to inspection by routers between the source an destination is removed.  Read up at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion

Lets look back to how the internet first started being set up.  There were a few small networks in different government buildings and schools that connected together using existing infrastructure (perhaps phone wires).  After this network was established using existing infrastructure (IP over modem over phoneline) it was expanded ontop of that scaffolding to be what we all enjoy today.

So

We already have this.  It's called tor.  Tor removes the need for DNS servers, and every other problem with making the existing internet ad-hoc.  Just think of tor as a network within a network (like how a virtual machine works on a computer - a computer in a computer).

The fact that tor exists within the internet is purely out of convenience that the internet exists and is available to facilitate these encrypted links.  In that sense, like on a mesh network, over connections on modems, over adhoc wifi connections, or any other communication medium.  As long as at least one tor node in the network connects back to the internet (as a backbone), or whatever other popular home for tor is that is not the internet, then you're on tor.

So

See where I am going with this?  Why don't we all start our own individual projects to deploy tor to odd places

Now, then if you know what you're doing feel free to chime in.

So first are the goals of the ""Phase 1"" Darknet

*  As Decentralized as possible. It should not rely on single computers to keep the whole network up.

*  Encryption. It should be extremely difficult for individual users to be tracked down.


*  Usability. If this system is not usable


* Finally it must be well planned. If we are not careful it could end up a kitty porn (in both senses of the term) haven and that would ruin the entire project. We want to allow free speech

What does this allow you to do? Well for example for TOR like functionality you would issue a connect() call with several VSL hosts as arguments. This connect call will then ""route"" the connection through these virtual hosts. It also now allows you to issue a remote listen call (which makes creating services like tor hidden services a whole lot easier) - the remote listen listens on a remote node for incoming connections and you can then just call ""accept()"" on the socket periodically to get a virtual socket for the remote connection. The remote host does not know your real IP only the node IP. On top of this you can easily implement tor-like functionality

Best thing: library exposes a standard sockets interface - which means you can call socket()

The code you will find here: 
git clone https://github.com/martinvolk/GlobalNet.git

Unfortunately I have not had time to finish the library all the way to 100%. Something that needs to be implemented is fully rendezvous connections (where two hosts call connect at the same time and none of them listens - which makes it possible to connect through firewalls). Also

These are two things that need to be done. And perhaps some more optimizations to make it really robust.

* Now automatically starts on system boot
* Prompts the user for peer info
* Automatic configuration file editing via sed now much less fragile (no longer relies on being laid out for specific line numbers to delete extraneous braces)

One of the things that I've believed pretty strongly about mesh software is that it's best packaged and easily installable, such as lack of a common packaging system, leave a lot to be desired.

When I was looking into Puppet today as a potential solution for some of the more convoluted aspects of server administration, or for security, off of Github entirely with ezcrypt.it), and the barrier to entry in terms of creating and maintaining them is much lower than with packages. There's also more stuff you can do with them, or at least more easily.

The problem, and I've heard Chef name-dropped. But I haven't actually worked with either one, and Puppet looks like it might have corporate licensing issues. So I'd like to propose the question to the big and wonderful /r/darknetplan crowd: Puppet, Chef, or take a third option entirely?

I'd love to see us have a standard cross-platform format for configuration manifests, plenty of meshnet efforts are working without this kind of tech being used at all.

====================================================
## WIRELESS BATTLE OF THE MESH SEEKING FOR ENDORSEMENTS
====================================================


The Battlemesh community is seeking for endorsements from well known
communities in the field of Community Networks
Open Source Software and Hacktivism.
Endorsement is just a fancy word that means to promote the event and
attract the maximum number of people as possible to the event.


========================
## What Does Endorsing Mean
========================


Endorsing means to publish an official press release (link to the press
release template here) on your website which will express your
community's support to the event and indicate any eventual involvement
of your community in the event.
For example
others might be the organizers; some others will hold one or more talks
and so on.


Additionally but not obbligatorily
hardware or money to the event.


All the communities endorsing the battlemesh v6 will be listed on the
[Endorsers 2013 page](http://battlemesh.org/Endorsements2013) of our
website with their logos
level of involvement with the event.


=====================
## Why Endorsing is Good
=====================


The interest in the event will surely grow if potential participants can
see many communities and skilled individuals are actively involved.


Our goals are:


* spread the word
* let potential attendants see who is coming
* have a poster with all the logos of the endorsers
* have a page with a list of the endorsers


==============
## How to Endorse
==============


* Copy the following [endorsement template](http://battlemesh.org/EndorsementTemplate) and modify it according to
your preferences
* Send a mail with the logo (300dpi transparent background in svg or eps format) and the description (bio
* Publish the press release on your website/blog
* Spread it with all the means you can: mailing list

This project has 27000 subscribers at this moment, but the subreddit looks stagnated. I imagine there is progress that I am not seeing, but for a project of this magnitude to work we need to have a working system that anyone can use and benefit from. I have a feeling that the websites hosted inside of hyperboria will not be as appealing for people who already have the regular internet. This leads me to my idea to attract more users.

Hyperboria's sales pitch should be DIY UNLIMITED FREE INTERNET. I am not a programmer, so they will have faster access. Things will slow down and latency will get worse as people get further away from nodes that have direct access to the internet. Would this work? How bad would the latency get? How well would this concept scale up to an entire continent? If I'm misled then please tell me so others don't repeat my crazy ideas.

I apologize if my post seems a little condescending.

so I was pleased to see the top link is to the recent Chronicle article. I wrote a comment there

---begin self copypasta---

What is needed is a device with the ubiquitous geographic distribution of modern router hardware

Something like an internet CB radio. =)

Its certainly becoming more obvious to everyone the potential benefits of creating a free and open network where one connects to ones nearest neighbors in a mesh oriented topology.

It is strange that it has taken so long for this to become apparent. It points to an overall paradigm shift in the architecture of contemporary wireless networking. 

All network architectures in common use thus far promote connectivity that is tethered to the infrastructure in a center-margin paradigm. The infrastructure owners are the center

Yet from an engineering perspective

I call it lopsided because it has prevented the equally important perception of the potential for connectivity between adjacent nodes. With so many routers already deployed in close proximity to each other, and providing an  interface for various kinds of information exchange between them: File sharing. LAN Gaming. Instant messaging. Mail messaging. Forums. Blog or homepage for each ""node"" similar to a facebook or google+ ""wall"".

One moves into a new apartment or neighborhood and one ""joins the mesh"" and meets their geographical neighbors in mesh space. 

The main idea is that this net network should not be promoted as a connection to the existing internet

While some implementation challenges still remain particularly with NAT

One reason for the need for such a network to exist in its own address space is the shortage of available addresses and subnets remaining in ipv4. Another reason is to promote the idea this is a ubiquitous network separate from the existing internet. Given appropriate encryption and certificate based authentication there is no reason users could not utilize the mesh infrastructure to establish a connection back to the public internet

Its purpose is the creation of a new

Thus the architecture shifts from being infrastructure-centric, to a truly device-centric paradigm.

As far as the naming of nodes and the namespace architecture of the new mesh network, but anyone using both the new mesh and the public internet from the same device or within the same network would definitely use the new TLD.

As for the assignment of domain names within the new namespace

Assuming the new network exists in its own private ipv6 subnet and using something like NDP or SNDP for dynamic allotment of address, local mesh address, and a name within a fixed domain hierarchy perhaps geographically oriented in nature and maintained regionally and locally by committees. This would resemble Big 7. Such a mapping if properly executed could even allow for the existence of mobile nodes and allow for a kind of roaming, especially locally. Meanwhile another hierarchy could exist with a separate TLD models on the ""alt"" hierarchy, allowing for a first come first serve dynamic naming of nodes with minimal or no certificate authentication.

As for the underlying topology of the network at the level of addressing ( as opposed to the level of naming ) this appears to be an area of ongoing research. The wikipedia articles Wireless_Mesh_Network and Ad_hoc_routing_protocol_list provide some clues of the challenges and possible implementations at this level of the architecture. Existing software implementations should be leveraged to get such a network going ASAP

All of this might seem like a lot of work

Old timers might recall the transition from bang-path style email addressing to the modern domain based addressing. This creation of this new network presents some similar challenges

But on the other hand

So hopefully whatever work is done in this new field is not seen as divisive or subversive but rather as the logical next step in the evolution of a truly digitally internetworked information age society.

---end self-copypasta---

Of course I think my ideas are fairly relevant to the ongoing development of the new mesh networking paradigm. But I'd be just as happy to see any of the ideas I present there get utilized as I would be to see them logically debated and ripped to shreds if it helps move things towards the development of a new mesh topology public network. 

Hopefully before the end of 2012 there will be something like a dd-wrt or openwrt router firmware incorporating this new idea of mesh networking. =) ",self,t5_2rju2,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/kvhvv/the_new_mesh_networking_paradigm/

If you're the kind of person who's coming here to say that ""X is infeasible because Y, that's just fine. That's the kind of thing this project needs: people with the knowledge to make it work.

My problem is with the people who are trying to *disrupt* the project. 

Maybe they're old hands at networking, Twittering, MW3-playing twelve-year-olds who think that the MeshNet Project's purpose is to provide them with their own personal WLAN so they can have all-night frag fests.

Maybe they're trolls who think that they can claim to be ""network engineers"" and people will listen to them when they throw around fancy graphs and say ""MESHNETS ARE ILLEGAL AND THE FCC WILL SEND MEN WITH GUNS TO YOUR HOUSE IF YOU BUILD ONE!""

Maybe, and I'm probably going to get people telling me to take off my tinfoil hat, but still.)

Being the older Redditor and software guy that I am (I watched an [IMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor) get installed one time..)

Before always-connected internet, the BBS system would upload a message bundle to another BBS, which would then split the bundle up into new bundles, and route them closer to the destination.  This was nice, because long-distance calls were expensive back then, and breaking it up into smaller hops kept it affordable for everyone.

FidoNet had some weaknesses
* The nodelist tables got to be large (because every node had to be listed)
* Messages were not encrypted
* Messages were not authenticated
* There was no end-to-end reliability.  If a message was dropped.. eh

All these problems are solvable with todays newer technology

Implications of adopting this system?  
* Communications become a store-and-forward experience.  No streaming live video, encrypted, and sent to you.  
* There is a dependence on the POTS telephone system.  As a lot of backup systems run by the authorities depend on it
* Many laptops no longer come with modem ports

VRR is a decentralized mesh networking protocol that collects nodes into a ring-like distributed hash table (similar to some Bittorrent clients). The cool part of VRR is that you can have a huge number of nodes (this module supports 2^32 per ""ring"") and not need to flood the network in order to route; the longest path length is bounded by 2n-1 of the optimal path length between nodes. There is a paper about it [here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/antr/MS/vrr_sigcomm.pdf) and a proof of the 2n-1 number [here](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/81834/VRRT.pdf).

While working on this project, so all traffic could be transparently encrypted and MITM-proof.

The code that has been written so far is a proof-of-concept, should anyone want to take this torch, would be to implement VRR as a userspace client that tunnels VRR traffic over IP.

&gt; As far as the general term, but there was no good way to change the subreddit name, so we were pretty much stuck with /r/darknetplan.

&gt; Closer to what you were actually asking, using physical-layer peer-to-peer mesh technology. The idea is that having the majority of human communication occur in plaintext untrusted connections relayed over a handful of telecoms monopolies is a BAD thing, and having a secure and censorship-resistant personally-owned replacement system is a heck of a lot better.

Reading between the lines here

Can anybody tell me if the Meshnet project is censorship resistant and maintains anonymity of its users

The term darknet has a lot of weight associated with it.  It means absolute anonymity

&gt; That’s why we don’t want to see it taken over by profit-motivated corporate interests. 

Sounds a bit adbusters

&gt; Networks that are owned by their users are subject to the same rules and regulations as networks that are owned by for-profit operators. 

Does this mean obeying the rules and regulations of the state

Starting to think meshnet has nothing to do with darknet at all.  Actually, but only when they are the censor.

**PART 2: The Big Question**

**Are the coders of Meshnet ready to create the next big child pornography trading technology?  If not

VHF (the next frequency band up from HF) has more available bandwidth but still has a relatively small allocation at only 4mhz of total spectrum. It's propagation is nowhere near that of HF either.

The UHF amateur band however has 30mhz of spectrum total. So while not as large as wifi (and obviously we can't consume the whole spectrum) there is still a fair amount of bandwidth. A bit of intuition leads me to believe that a reasonable allocation of 5mhz would net us about 4mbps of bandwidth.

In terms of range we should be able to hit the radio horizon with ample power. This should be somewhere between 13-18 miles without needing huge towers to provide fresnel zone clearance like wifi (though they would help!).

Let me say that first, if not at the very least just for fun! I myself have several major complaints with the internet as it stands:

*  ICANN's stranglehold on the DNS. If .xxx wasn't already enough, it almost literally reads like, ""Nice trademark you got there, it'd be a shame if not registering it under a TLD you will literally never use to pre-empt domain squatters would be used as evidence of abandonment...""

* The intrinsic insecurity of the internet

* Outrageous abuses of local monopolies by ISPs. Filtering traffic, port blocking, instead of, you know, investing money back into the network.

There are of course many more shortcomings I could list. However, baseless speculation. Specifically, it seems to be a common belief that the US government is explicitly preparing some sort of mechanism to censor the internet en masse. There is a quote I like by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, that I believe to be pertinent to this issue, ""Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him."" SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, etc were/are all stupid, and others into some nebulous concept, or whatver

The thing is, ""When we get the remote Russian village online, what will get people to the Internet is not going to be reports from Human Rights Watch. It’s going to be pornography, ‘Sex and the City,’ or maybe funny videos of cats.” But the biggest problem is that this mythologized struggle against the internet, as some sort token of democracy, is fundamentally misguided if not delusional. For starters, people somehow think a dictator can't access it, what is more suspicious? Blocking the internet

**About me**

As this is also my first post in this community (besides a few comments), Oslo, working on both the client and server side. I consider myself a skilled, although I obviously have lots still to learn.

I'm interested in helping out any way I can (and have time for). I'll get onto IRC one of the days in the near future

**Problem 1: It's pricey to do business**

It's easy to get a server set up on the Internet, is a million dollar investment, solely because of infrastructure (given you'd get the same visitors of course).

So even if you have an application, simply because of lack of funding. And even with funding you would have to find a way to return that investment, probably lowering the quality or value of the product.

*- Whoa! Your app is so smooth - it must have been expensive to make!*

*- Well.. Our app is worth $20

**Problem 2: ..and there it broke**

Does it scale? Probably not. Closely related to the first problem is the risk of your service failing once it gets too popular. We've all seen the ""please try again"" pages around the web, a DDoS attack cannot.

*- I though we wouldn't need to care about this scaling-shit once we where set up in the cloud.*

*- You still need to configure, optimize and rent more servers, stupid!*

**Problem 3: Locking down is the norm**

On the desktop I am able to choose whether I want to open a movie in VLC, but that Youtube would lose revenue, and hence doesn't allow it.

API's goes a long way to help share and distribute content, because you aren't getting the whole picture. Twitter's API sucks, because your searching/traversing abilities are limited.

*- I have some old photos on Facebook. How can I show them to my granny

*- You can't really. You know what they say. Same shit; same wrapping.*

**Problem 4: My content - your rights**

As soon as anything is submitted to a service, Facebook have had several, and I'm certain you'll find something questionable in a lot of EULA's, TOS's and similar abbreviations.

While we have to understand that these companies does this mainly to protect them self

*- Did I get this right? In order to use your service

*- Just sign on the dotted line please.*

**Problem 5: No easy way to audit**

While we might trust a lot of companies with our data

I understand the risks, not the clothes i wear or the places I've been to.

*- I watched one episode of Epic Meal Time

*- You have to even it out by searching for the opposite. Try 'PETA'.*

**Problem 6: One fall and all is lost**

Censorship is still a huge problem on the internet, if located, be taken down. It doesn't happened often, and with cjdns making it harder to locate and take down services, we are certainly going the right direction.

But the problem remains; it's possible to censor services

*- My favorite site showed this FBI warning today

*- It doesn't matter if it was wrong

**So

This isn't an easy one, but don't hesitate to ask if I missed something.

Now, without the need of any central servers. Content would be signed by the provider, then published to all peers the provider is connected to. These pees will be able to share the content to other peers outside of the providers reach.

Applications made for the protocol should be written in web standards, just like on a smartphone.

Content is published through a *stream*, without cost or other conditions. The owner of a stream decides who is able to publish to it. This makes it possible to set up different distributions schemes, such as one-to-many (newspaper, movie studio) and many-to-many (discussions, collaboration tools).

When content is published to a stream it does so by a *post*, a thumbnail and a movie are all different content in it self, but can be related.

The whole process is tied together with a DHT, subscribes to a stream (or a content type, tag or w/e) to get the content. This can of course be annotated with data from other sources, for instance for search or multi-factor authentication, but all content should be published through the system.

With the right implementation, and it would massively increase the users ability to filter and interact like they want. (At least like *I* want.)

There are some problems with this solution as well, so let me know.

I have some other thoughts on how go a little further

* Web of trust system (to battle spam and similar) (upvote/downvote)
* Smart DRM/licensing system (usable and open)
* Streaming
* Identity handling
* Proxying

**Keep feedback constructive, as long as you stay on topic.

And many more. However

If we take a step back, hardware and applications which ensure free speech.

My idea is the following:

Remember UUCP? It was popular back in the day. With it

Maybe, and is broadcasted to the whole network. This way, bandwidth wouldn't be a problem: only text messages would go through the network. Maybe small images too.

This would be the perfect way to create some sort of ""twitter"" for events like OWS. There is no central server hosting it.

This is how it would work: users would have an application in their smartphone which implements our protocol. Let's say we're building a distributed twitter.

When I send a message, the original application used to send the message, and so forth.

Then, receives that packet and his application shows my ""tweet"". Then, he can choose to relay that message, so more people can hear me.

Project Darknet

In light of current events, has exploded in growth. Ever since the United States started their controversial SOPA Act, or Stop Online Piracy Act, the internet has banded together to try and stop this obstruction of free speech. While many try to convince the US to stop their hypocritical attack against our rights, others, notably the Darknet Plan community on the website Reddit, are trying to set up an open internet


While our modern Internet is connected through fibre-optic cables, the Darknet Plan is trying to push the boundaries of technology by creating a completely wireless, and therefore an internet that is under the control of no one. This mesh of wireless networks will create an online base where there is no infrastructure to take control of; basically, a place where privacy is abundant, and censorship is banished. 
So what is the problem with our current Internet? First and foremost, the government only has to issue a law stating that these places must be blocked. The Darknet Plan, however, is an internet operated and run not by ISP (Internet Service providers), but by the users themselves, and is therefore completely free to use.


Imagine the internet as a single track


Now imagine a gigantic spider-web that covers every computer in the vicinity. Each intersection of strings, or cellphone. Some of these intersections are also stationary; these mesh-routers connect everyone as well, but they don't have to connect to the internet at all! These points of connection are known as nodes. Essentially, every computer is connected to several other computers. If one node, or computer fails, the others continue to operate, either directly or indirectly, this spiderweb is wireless; There are no lines to control


This system has many benefits over our current system. By connecting nodes to each other, and both be equally as reliable. If this web were to cover a whole city, then a laptop or cellular phone could go anywhere within that city and always be connected. Imagine going from one Starbucks to another without having to lose internet. Moreover, if this type of network managed to be connected over an entire continent, one could go an a road trip, and still have a reliable internet!


Despite all its advantages, as this community-driven effort grows, so does the realization of a dream. A dream of a free, private, and reliable internet.",,False,t5_2rju2,True
