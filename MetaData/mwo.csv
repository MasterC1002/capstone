1372571373.0,1hcp3g,The Gameplay Balance problems leading to the peek-and-shoot meta,Peter2000_HHoD,108,21,105,"**Preface**

As part of a recent push by the competitive tournament community to reach out to the devs, simple solutions), since PGI doesn't currently seem to have a good structure for listening to the players who spend the most time trying to break game balance.  The mwomercs forum post can be found at http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/124605-the-gameplay-balance-problems-leading-to-the-peek-and-shoot-meta/

**Introduction**

There is currently a growing consensus among many of the more competitively-minded players that the game is rapidly becoming one dimensional. Not only in competitive 8-mans, it is very easy to hit any ‘Mechs which expose themselves for any considerable period of time. In particular, it encourages “peek and shoot” snipers (usually Stalkers, due to their narrow profile with high-mounted energy hardpoints) who spend a minimal period exposed to potential counter-fire. Moreover, even when these snipers are closed in on, they are often able to out-brawl supposed brawlers - in large part due to the state of SRMs (normally a crucial part of the brawler’s arsenal - now obsolete), and the relative heat efficiency of PPCs and the ERPPC+Gauss combo.

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Ballistics**

Really

There are some real trade-offs here. The gauss weighs an extra ton, increased projectile speed, and very low heat. 

Ultimately

**Ballistic Supplementary**

You can ""snipe"" with AC/2s, and don't work well in the peek-and-shoot strategy currently prevalent. A gauss will destroy them every time if well played. Likewise, the UAC/5 is a potent weapon, but its fast refire-rate precludes defensive torso-twisting, and therefore really falls more into a fire-support role (where AC/2 and AC/5 also live). The AC/10 tends to be outclassed by the AC/20 or the gauss rifle, depending on the intended use, while the LBX/10 suffers from spread preventing panel-focusing. Machine guns are getting better, and ""criticals"" after armor is stripped are unimportant when it's still so much easier to just knock out the entire section with a ""real"" weapon.

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Energy**

ERPPCs and PPCs represent the energy weapons used for sniping. For brawling, of course, is that heat efficiency is actually not in the favor of brawling weapons. Medium lasers provide a significant tonnage savings compared to the sniper weapons. However, they have the same heat efficiency (i.e. staying power) in a brawl. Moreover, the tonnage savings cannot be used to improve this - since heat sinks are mostly maxed out on snipers anyway, nor can additional firepower be acquired, due to hardpoint number limitations. Large lasers are taken on brawlers primarily to offset hardpoint caps (if you don’t want to take SRMs, then you need to put on lots of energy to still have firepower). They too have comparable heat efficiency to the PPC (somewhat ahead of the ERPPC) - but suffer from having a one second beam duration

The PPC is a better brawling weapon than the supposed brawling energy alternatives. Before HSR was implemented for PPC/ballistics, those buffs became excessive and these weapons came to dominate gameplay. It may make sense to increase heat and/or decrease projectile speed again. 

**Energy Supplemental**

ERLL seem superficially to fill a similar role to the ERPPC. However, their 90m range is too close for effective brawling focus fire. Large Pulse and Medium Pulse have shorter ranges and weigh more than their standard variants. More importantly, they generate even more heat per point of damage dealt. This is widely considered to more than offset the slightly shorter beam duration. 

**Brawling vs. Sniping: Missile**

None of the missile weapons really fall into either category effectively at the moment. For the same reason AC/2 is not a sniper weapon, but the very low total damage (3/hardpoint) means they are really only useful against smaller, harder-to-hit ‘Mechs. 

**SRM Balance**

SRMs have been the quintessential brawler weapon in MWO in months past. In fact, SRMs were overpowered. At one time, they did 2.5 damage per missile, and splashed full damage to many components. Moreover, the old trajectory meant that if you ""face hugged"" an enemy (collided with, and stayed within ~10m), your missiles would all hit in a pinpoint manner. The new trajectory prevents this

However, ASRM6 to a large laser. With one ton of ammo, weight is equivalent, and 2 extra crits (and explosive potential on one of them!) are paid. You also do the same damage with both systems. The large laser generates slightly more heat, but the SRM spreads the damage, has a very slow projectile, a limited number of shots, it is one of the most balanced weapons in the game. SRMs are inefficient right now, so the obvious thing to buff would be the damage. 2.0 damage would be a good start. More numbers can be tweaked in the future. 

**Why the ""boating penalty"" currently proposed will not fix PPCs or the ""peek-and-shoot"" meta**

One of the most popular builds at the moment is the Stalker with 4 PPCs (often ER, and dropping back down. The game often boils down into two broad stages - first is the sniping phase. Here, the team crests, fires, and drops down to cool off and take cover. Heat is of minimal concern, since you should be safe from any return fire until you decide to crest again - so a 10 heat penalty can be shrugged off if needed. The second phase is encountered when one side tries to push up on the other. For lack of a better word, it is the brawl, to a large extent, many other highly effective builds feature Gauss with 2 or 3 ERPPCs - which would not at all be impacted by this change. 

Nerfing the interesting (and in no way OP) HBK-4P to the ground would be in vain. 

**Conclusion**

The “peek and shoot” meta, ‘Mechs such as the PPC-boat Stalker, which could already compete with jump snipers at their best, were unaffected by this change. Naturally, they have become dominant.

Two problems present themselves, ERPPC, Gauss), and one strategy (peek and shoot). First is the efficiency of the PPC/ERPPC relative to other weapons. It is both too easy to hit enemies at 1000m+ range and keep up a barrage if and when they close. Both heat and projectile speed (if PPC projectile speed is lowered significantly, Gauss should slow slightly, to preserve the different behaviors between the two weapons) should be looked at for nerfs. It is impossible to know what the right number is without testing, but it certainly does not seem that the current values are comparable to the other energy weapons. 

Second (and most important) is the state of SRMs. In the past, they could expect their weapons would out damage the enemy’s. However, only the AC/20 is even close to that mark currently - and SRMs are desperately needed to fill that void of viable super-close-range weapon. 

What’s more, as were fast flanking mediums which could afford SRM tonnage, but not AC/20 tonnage. Very strong PPCs have also contributed to the decline of use of the light and medium classes, since these sniping weapons are very heavy - precluding them from being boated on the lighter classes, and are so fast that hitting even a smaller, faster target at extreme range is not uncommon. Presumably a decrease in their effectiveness would help the light and medium classes. 

Once the public test server becomes available, including the wildly successful League of Legends, have followed such a model with great success. We want MWO to be as successful, but fear that it might falter if it does not get input from some of the players who spend the most time and effort studying the game in order to kill each other most effectively.

Here are the details:

* Allow Testing Grounds mode to let a player test any 'Mech—including and especially Hero 'Mechs—with any configuration
* Once a player selects ""Training Grounds"" as the game mode it would pop up a 'MechLab that includes their currently owned 'Mechs in addition to every stock variant
* The player can then select and customize any variant of any chassis at will—including components, non-persistent way
* The player won't pay for anything done in the Training Grounds 'MechLab and once the Training Grounds are exited the changes are lost
* Any changes made in the Training Grounds 'MechLab to 'Mechs the player owns would revert back to their previous state after the practice match
* Having a separate ""Saved Training Grounds 'Mechs"" section would be an even better way of enticing players get excited about possible new designs
* On the endgame screen leaving the Testing Grounds
* The button auto-navigates to the 'MechLab and selects the 'Mech the player just tested for purchase with MC (which would then have to be confirmed again by the player)
* A secondary option (as suggested by [tunarr](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/19xego/how_pgi_can_make_lots_of_money_from_testing/c8s82wp)) is adds a button that allows the tested loadout to be purchased with C-Bills if the player has enough in their account
* If the player does not have enough bays to purchase a new 'Mech
* When the player does not have enough MC available to purchase the tested variant (and, the button instead changes to say something like, ""Like this 'Mech?  Click here to add MC to make it yours!""
* In this case, using a system akin to the one outlined above
* Should the player already own the variant brought to Testing Grounds, defaulting to pre-selecting a purchase for 30 days of Premium—or would simply not activate

Update: SOME numbers

**Machine Guns**
MGs are getting their damage doubled to 0.08/shell.
MG range is going to be 120m and they will fall off to 0 damage at 240m.
MG Spread will remain unchanged for the moment. 

**LB10-X** has had it's cone of fire reduced by 20%

**LRM** speed will be increasing from 100m/s to 120m/s. This equates to about 5-10% more missiles hitting a moving target and it's quite a bit harder to dodge LRMs.

**AC/5**
After reading my last post

**NARC** is going to have its firing distance increased as well as it's duration. This is still undergoing testing and will have numbers for you when they're ready.

**BAP**
Now here's the biggie. BAP is meant to increase your sensor range by amplifying your sensor systems. It allows you to get detail targeting information faster and also allows you to detect nearby shutdown Mechs. Yeah? So?... well...

**BAP will now negate ECM within 150m (tuning number) of the enemy.** Negate? What 'chu talkin' 'bout Paul?

If Mech X has BAP, Mech Y loses all effects of ECM. **It is a 100% counter to ECM**. Mech Y is now vulnerable to LRMs/S-SRMs as long as Mech X stays within 150m. Any friendly Mechs to Mech Y will no longer be shielded until Mech X leaves the 150m area around Mech Y.

ECM is now a long range Mech item. A scout can now use it to remain hidden from LRMs while performing their job. A LRM/command Atlas can rain down death while maintaining LoS on their distant targets without worries of LRMs coming back at them.

**ECM is now getting a dedicated hardpoint that works just like AMS**. It will be located in a dedicated component such as the right or left torso.

**ECM will also no longer mess with friendly IDF markings** so you always know who's friend and foe.


**Missile Update**:
Missiles are coming along. A lot of stuff has been rewritten and we have to test and retune numbers to get them ready to be released back into the live game. So far LRM's are looking really good and SRM's are soon to be addressed as well. As of this writing we're putting the final numbers on LRMs so they'll be ready for large scale testing very soon.

**DATE: All of the above is expected to be released in the May 21st patch.**

_________________________

*1st day playing MWO:*

Holy fuck. JESUS. So many stuffs (and buttons) to learn! Eh what this alpha thing button do... and boom goes the back of the mech leading in front of me. Uhhh maybe I'll start with training mode.

_________________________

*2nd day:*

Oooh there's a lot of logics in this game. *You actually gotta think man.* Where I move

_________________________

*3rd day:*

Still hardly remember those variants. Also why the hell some mech can almost 1 shot you? Right now running the trial assault mech that can jumpjet. Also liking the indirect LRM so far (prior to LRM patch + hotfix). Well

_________________________

*4th day to week end:* 

Got my first Atlas (DDC). Sooo now I'm broke. Looked around and I just realized that those crazy C-bills rate is only for the first 25 matches. 

Hmm.. WELL WHO CARES. I FUCKING GOT AN ATLAS WOOOOO

_________________________
*Atlas DDC first match:*

Twas grilled hard. And some guy in the chat asked what's the point of getting DDC if I don't even equip ECM.  
My thoughts: what ECM?
_________________________

*Atlas DDC

PPC YOOO. Them pilot skills almost halfway getting that 4x magnification. Equipping LRM now. It seems I'm pretty comfortable fighting at long ranges. And then I had these sad realization about why bother purchasing an Atlas at all if I'm fighting all the way back? Trashed my atlas build and came up with..
_________________________

Atlas DDC ""Yamato"":

Weaps: 2 ER PPC, 1 MG
Others: DHS, ECM, AMS, STD300, leg armor ~51-ish

Yes yes. Noob build of course but what's important here

__________________________

*Past week:*

Taken a more direct command of the team.  

Map: Tourmaline.  
Mode: Assault  
Situation: Dire. Enemy already halfway thru the map and almost encroaching base.   

The team has been sticking under my ECM religiously so I shouted to approach into C4 (or D4?). Even then

One guy copied. The rest followed. An Atlas head pops up over the corner with no blue mark. Looking at everyone's aiming direction


End of round: 8-0.  
Personal record: 2 kills 5 assist

After that, smell the fresh air, and then sit down for a long time thinking how amazing that battle went and how harder to even pull it off without knowing anybody on the team. 
_________________________
**Final Verdict:**  
**This game is fun. Slow, = less weapons, fast), it is much easier to understand. If anything, it is a properly made pseudo-FPS that lets you relax while playing it. I like it.**

Things I wish they change / add:

1. Clearly notify user about that Cadet Bonus period in-game.
2. Final damage display on some weapons (SRMs
3. Add a quick note about choosing your first mech.
4. Custom HUD (hard call I know)
5. Those auto-detect screens in your cockpit. Why can't you use them?

I've been pretty quiet about this stuff

SRMs were the dominant brawling weapon. In a brawl, although the extent of that reduction seems somewhat excessive given their limited range and accuracy.

The problem with the SRM damage reduction has been that, the PPC heat reduction and projectile speed increases increased the usefulness of snipers in general. I think the community outcry regarding SRMs is more about wanting to have some more useful close range weaponry, so that if you manage to close the distance against the now-dominant long range mechs you will at least be rewarded for it.

Conversely

Many people are also upset about the preponderance of PPCs. PGI has taken a different approach here. Instead of reducing damage (as they did with SRMs), increasing weight or increasing size they are proposing a new mechanic that penalises (using heat) simultaneously firing multiple weapons of the same type. This seems like it is intended to address boating in general, rather than PPCs specifically - but PGI has conflated the two by presenting is as a solution to PPC boating.

In my assessment, they would address them the same way they addressed SRMs.

Additionally

I feel PGI should either invest development time in a proper hard-point system - where individual weapons are mounted in individual hard-points with size restrictions - or stop worrying about boating and just balance the weapons.

Can you hear the sound of bagpipes off in the distance? That is the sound of the Highlander standard variants marching into your mechbay.   This ‘Mech is a sight to behold and now you can take it for a spin without having to be in a Hot Pink Hero mech.

Introducing our first Champion ‘Mech! Chosen by the people for the people! The Dragon 5N is the first stock ‘Mech to get the Champion treatment with a 10% XP boost. Will this replace your existing DGN 5N?  Will this be your first Dragon?  Take the Trial Mech 5N Version for a spin and see how effective this ‘Mech is. 

Battlefield coordination just got easier. We have added Lances and Lance Leader who can issue orders on the battle grid menu. The Commander can now issue orders to both Lances. You can press U to start a Lance Chat message in game. Read and use this feature to coordinate your team and dominate the battlefield! 

For those customization lovers we have new 'Mech Statues for your cockpit and a cool new pattern called Fractal.

  We have Projectile network improvements as well. Auto cannons

____

**New Cockpit items:**

    - Raven statue.
    - Stalker statue.
    - Commando statue.

**New Skin:**

    - Fractal camo spec.

____

**Gameplay**

**Maps**

    - Added baked in shadows to terrain in all maps.
    - Changed geometry near edge of Tourmaline Desert where many players were being led out of bounds.
    - Updated Warning Billboard signs shader in River City.

**Networking**

Host State Rewinding Phase 2 (Ballistic/PPC weapons)

    - You should no longer have firing delay when shooting a ballistic/PPC weapon.
    - You should now be able to hit moving targets with these weapons even when experiencing
       latency up to ~450 ms.
    - Missile weapons are not affected by this change
    - The complete list of affected weapons:
        - PPC.
        - ERPPC.
        - AC20.
        - AC10.
        - AC5.
        - AC2.
        - Gauss.
        - LB10-XAC.
        - UltraAC5.

**Performance**

    - Extra server compression of movement state transmitted to clients
 
**Matchmaking**

    - Added ability to tune weight class and Elo matching thresholds during runtime.
    - Adjusted player Elo down to their correct values by re-simulating match history (to account
       for the Elo-inflation bug).    
    - Users who disconnect during matchmaking are now correctly removed from their pending match.
       This should help reduce the number of erroneous 'failed to find match' errors.
 
**Lances**

    - Players will automatically be grouped into lances when they join a match.
    - Players who are grouped together before entering the match will be assigned to lances
        together as best as possible.
    - There is a maximum of 4 players per lance
        - Currently
    - Players will now have a lance HUD element in the upper left of their screen which will inform
        them of their lancemates' health and grid location.
    - Members of your lance will be marked in a different color on your HUD.
    - In addition to taking command of the team
        while in the BattleGrid.
        - The team commander is automatically the commander of his lance.  The team commander's 
           lance cannot have a separate lance commander.
    - Lance commanders can assign orders to their lance.  Only members of their lance will see the orders.
        - Lance commanders are marked with captain's bars.
    - Team commanders can assign orders to all lances
        - Team commanders are marked with a star.
    - Commanders can remove orders they have given by clicking the order on the BattleGrid and choosing
        ""REMOVE ORDER"".
    Team commanders can rearrange lance membership by dragging the players' names to different
     lances on the BattleGrid.
    - Players can chat to just the members of their lance by pressing 'U'.

**Bug Fixes**

    - Fixed an issue where certain users were getting random graphical corruption in the 
        HUD (lots of multi colored polygons).
    - Fixed one case of users crashing mid game.
    - Fixed an issue where users with high latency would be stuck on a black screen after loading into a match.
    - Fixed an issue where after a user failed to load into a map other users could experience a black screen.
    - Fixed a bug that was causing Elo to rise by a large amount when defeating a weaker opponent
        see details in command chair post.
    - Numerous map bug fixes.
    - Numerous Front End bug fixes.

**General**

    - Additional tooltips added throughout the Front End.
    - Gameplay tips added to loading screens.

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

Not even in a hissy fit

Now I don't know if you guys have had this experience. But let me tell you, as I'm writing this post complaining about complaining (How's THAT for meta ;) ). 

But guys

I love playing the game

I've got it stocked out with a 300XL, sometimes I do terrible, sometimes I get on a roll, top the match score charts and get 5 kills! (rarely &gt;_&gt;) But I've found it's always due to my playing, and not the build. I do have it elited, which does a lot for it I suppose.

I get more kills in my AC40 Jager

It's a build that has weathered Gausscats, LRM hell, PPC alpha and I believe will do me well in metas to come.

The fixes only serve to make the game less accessible and more unattractive to new players.  The best solution to the problem is NOT more resource management or added layers of artificial depth.  From my experience trying to get people interested in playing MWO

I enjoy playing this game and I want it to last

Let's take a well known example in the F2P gaming community

DotA is well regarded to its fanbase because of the complex and deep levels of strategy involved.  But the downfall is that the systems involved are so esoteric that it is unfriendly towards new players, and complex heros etc which are ESSENTIAL to winning.

LoL is similar to DotA but simplified the model to make it more accessible to new players by removing the more tedious elements and streamlining the interface.  This is GOOD because although the game is easy to learn at face value

Right now the problem is that MWO is difficult to learn and easy-medium to master.  New players either can't get past the hump of figuring out how to build a decent mech


I think that after the initial balance problems, LRMs).  They have recently taken a much more measured approach to game balance (recent LRM patch) which has been successful in my opinion.

Demanding that PGI make big changes that some random guy thought up is not what I want.  I want PGI to keep doing what they are doing


BOTTOM LINE:
The problem with this game isn't balance

If the MWO team focuses on constant player requests for balance and implementing complex arbitrary systems it will leave them with less time and resources to expand this game in the areas that it needs to be expanded.  If PGI gives in to the wishes of the loudest complainers

UPDATE

Greetings MechWarriors

So we have gone and done it again! Victor Hero is releasing first and what a beauty it is. Having The Dragon Slayer in your Mech lab will probably melt your face off with pure ""Mech goodness"". Then again
Oh boy It's the ATLAS Champion! Want to try the Atlas RS build that was the Piranha Favourite for much of closed beta? Here you go! It's a mostly-brawler

Hey look some Cockpit Items! Mech Statues. Enjoy!

Hey Look a new Mech Pattern! Tartan!...Bless you.... Thank you... You're Welcome!

We have some interesting gameplay tweaks that are going to change how you play. Movement on inclined surfaces and a new overheat mechanic so watch your heat or you might get beat.

Various other Items are all in the patch notes for you to read so go ahead and read them!
See you on the Battlefield!

If anyone has heard of the game cosmic break 

It seems to me that the biggest hurdle to this would be the implementation of AI

Heck they already have a decent number of maps, and need to take down a lance of scouts, and then defend the area against in-coming re-enforcements, then on the next level, its forest colony snow, and you have to lead an exodus of civilians out before the area is bombarded.

1369330959.0,1ewyxm,The tale of a Brave Soul,I7Goblins,60,13,10,"I would like to tell a tale of a brave soul who dared to live a dream.

“All systems nominal

As our scouts reach the enemy team we begin receiving quick pings of available targets mixed with the sound of launching missiles

Then things seem to quiet down momentarily, preparing for what is to come. 

Suddenly the calm is broken with a giant volley of LRMs from the opposing force, scaring their targets with a molten glow. The report of ballistic shells add a calm yet intimidating cadence to the battlefield’s ambience as they slam into their targets.  PPCs rounds begin hitting targets with silent, deadly precision, their shooters rising and falling from the skyline.

The team communication system suddenly comes alive…

Brave Soul: ""I'm going to sneak around and over heat them with my flamers!""

Brave Soul then turns to the team in his newly found Blackjack and fires off a full armament of flamers at once

Rest of the Team: ""lol god speed""

Intrigued, getting closer and closer to the core of the enemy line.  So far he is unscathed, all light mechs are off to the left or intertwining through the center trying to heard the other mechs and break stragglers away from their teams.

An opposing Centurion suddenly comes into view, only one hill away from Brave Soul, who has come to a stop to allow for the supporting fire to clear the path.  With nowhere to go, the enemy Centurion tries to turn and retreat, but it is too late, one final mixed blast of fire from the team violently blow him up.

Curious, as if he is contemplating his decisions.  However, his mech suddenly turns towards his targets with confidence; he knows what he must do.  

The battlefield is now a beautiful display of organized chaos.  By now several mechs from each side have fallen and people are engaged in hard fought battles. Brave Soul makes his move and charges his first target

I forget to maintain firing at my target as I watch Brave Soul.  I shift focus to his target who just sent off a deadly volley of PPC bolts in my direction, and the Stalker is looking right at me, I am clearly targeted.  The next round of PPC volleys slam into my right torso, the Stalker is met with an immediate shutdown.  

Brave Soul…you son of a bitch.

Being shutdown must have allowed the pilot to notice the pillar of flame engulfing his cockpit. The Stalker pilot must have called out Brave Soul to his teammates since a few other enemy mechs in the back line turn and open fire on Brave Soul.  Brave Soul begins to maneuver and use the Stalker as a barrier and keep it between him and the new enemy threats

The Stalker powers up again, I think I can destroy my target before he gets a final volley of PPCs off, which will surely be my end.  I was wrong, I don’t kill him in time; PPCs get fired into my direction. However, only a single PPC round is sent my way! He must have been trying to manage his heat.  My center torso is now critically damaged, but regardless of his caution, the enemy Stalker still over heats!  

Brave Soul…You son of a bitch.

As I pound away at the Stalker

Close to overheating myself, completely unaware of the rest of the battle, I must save Brave Soul!  Brave Soul’s attackers have been somewhat distracted by the rest of the friendly force who won the battle in the center of the battlefield. The eneymy mechs hesitate between switching targets and pay for it.  A heavily damaged Catapult continues to fire upon Brave Soul, determined to take him down.  I engage the Catapult, trying to distract and interrupt the best I can.  

Despite my efforts

Brave Soul begins scorching the enemy

A violent alpha strike annihilates the enemy Catapult from behind.  The match is over.  The battlefield falls silent and there he is

Before I have a chance to type out a message to this crazy pilot I see:

Brave Soul has disconnected.

With no need to flaunt his flaming victory or desire to receive any kind of recognition for his feat of blazing glory

Brave Soul…You son of a bitch

While I would have much rather had Brave Soul equipped with actual weaponry

My hat goes off to all of you out there who dare who break the norms and create fun experiences.",self,t5_2t1w0,1369337930.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1ewyxm/the_tale_of_a_brave_soul/

1364924042.0,1bizvv,April 2nd Patch Notes,Fireye,53,3,132,"Greetings MechWarriors

Yesterday was April Fool's day but these patch notes are no joke!

First is our Hero BattleMech Heavy Metal! Yes this 'Mech is pink and does really play music when you get a kill! This is the first time we have released the Hero Mech before the base variants (coming April 16th). Don't let the color stop you from buying it

Next we have added air-strike and artillery consumables. I think Conquest mode just got more interesting! Here is a pro tip: Use them for when a light is capping your base on Alpine and save yourself a walk back to your spawn!

New Thermal and Night Vision modes are in! They look amazing and are balanced for game play! No more BlueWarrior for you!

We also have cool new digital camo patterns for your 'Mech and more 'Mech Statues for your cockpit! Keep reading for other fixes and tweaks!

See you on the battlefield!

      power up
    - While in the middle of a power up/down sequence

      recent changes:
        - At any time you can press P to power your Mech on/off
        - Each time you press P
            this is to help prevent people who constantly spam the P key from continually powering up and down

            opposite sequence once the current sequence is complete
        - If your heat level reaches 100%

                automatic shutdown is ignored. (Note: Even after the 5 seconds have passed
                automatically shutdown if you are over 100% heat.)
            - Each time you press O
            - You can manually power down after overriding the automatic shutdown by pressing P
                will not automatically power back up when your heat drops below 100% (though you will know this               
                has happened when your screen stops flashing red)
        - If you remain powered up while over 100% heat

1351297308.0,125hjq,Learned Bias and MWO. Your last favorite shooter has filled your head with LIES.,CakeBandit,58,12,50,"I'd like to take a wall of text and yammer about why a bunch of our learned biases are wrong in the context of MWO.

To all outward appearances, most badass thing the galaxy has ever seen. That's what the advertizing is selling players. They're seeing Atlas stomp around cities, laser beams charring gaping holes in other mechs and glorious explosions everywhere. Once you dig yourself into the mechanics of the game you see why this might not even be how we want to market the game. Let's hit the big points that seem unimportant but really set Mechwarrior Online apart from the rest of the shooters of the past decade. Some of them fundamental things you have to re-learn to succeed.

* 1: **LIMITED MOBILITY. MOST NOTABLY TURNING SPEED.**

&gt;Alright

Wrong you are. It's a very intentional mechanic. It forces you to be deliberate and decisive in your actions. It's part of why I struggle so much in the heavier chassis. Your momentum and your movement matter in a very significant way in MWO, CoD all feature the ability to rapidly re-orient your vision and by association your ability to deal damage.

In MWO

* 2: **TEAMWORK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVEN IN TEAM FORTRESS 2.**

&gt;No way man

Wrong again

In a lot of games your individual ability as a player is defined by your ability to put targets down faster than you can be put down. Most notably seen by sniper classes that tend to deal lots of damage to very specific parts of players but are fragile themselves. These classes are typically seen as the pinnacle of play

That's not how it works here. Not quite at least.

DPS is still important, it's still a fairly reasonable assumption that another shot is going to take the target down unless they run away. In MWO, if you miss a shot, your next shot is liable to thunk harmlessly into a non-vital area. Even if you were to make the shot there's almost no such thing as a one-hit kill. Add to that the fact that the only hitscan weapons we have in the game require you to maintain your aim on a target to deal their maximum potential and you have a lot of very confused/unhappy campers.

All of this goes against what we've been learning in a lot of different games. Nothing wrong with it

* 3: **THERE IS NO MEDIC**

&gt;Wait

Because there's also no revival feature. If you make mistakes mid-match *everyone has to live with them.* Even you. Y'know what? Especially you, or a way to heal teammates/yourself. Other games don't slap you and tell you to walk it off.

Not here. Walk it off

You run out ahead of everyone, you're going to pay for it later. Which brings me to my next point.

* 4 **YOUR MISTAKES FOLLOW YOU OUTSIDE OF A MATCH**

&gt;I bought an Atlas and can't make any money with it! I thought this thing was supposed to be good!

It is! It's just covered in a lot of very expensive metal that you keep getting blown off and filled with very expensive parts that you keep having to replace. If you manage to do really poorly in a match, it's going to come back and bite you in the end.

Change Log

Update:

_Greetings MechWarriors_

_I am truly excited to welcome you to this patch for 5 good reasons:_

_#1 - The Jagermech: Ballistics fans

_#2 - Tourmaline Desert: You're going to love this map. It looks amazing and plays even better! It’s perfect for the Jagermech I just bought._

_#3 - New Controls: Gas pedal? Check! Arm Lock? Check! Centre Legs to Torso? Check! Improved joystick controls? Check. Changing all these options in game? Priceless! (Test them out in the Testing Grounds!)_

_#4 - Consumables System and Cool Shot: Do you ever find yourself running hot? Is override not going to get the job done without BBQing your internals? Try using the brand new Cool Shot on your BattleMech and you just might survive to fight another day._

_#5 - New Customizations: We’ve added the Vagabond pattern and some new BattleMech statues for your cockpit. What better way to show the Jagermech you just bought that you love it than a new paint job and some decorations?_

_Did I mention that we also increased the server count for the new map we just added? See you in the desert

_Matt Newman._

**Tourmaline Desert**

The Tourmaline Desert is found on a small sun-baked planetoid in a binary star system. The bedrock is largely granite covered, are the endless, towering outcrops of massive tourmaline crystals that reach up against a scarlet nebula. The mean temperature is ~97°C, with an atmosphere comprised mainly of carbon dioxide with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, sodium and water vapour.

The planetoid is located along a strategic corridor

BattleMech warriors will have a challenging fight ahead of them. Heat management will be a huge priority

1369776018.0,1f83ps,"Achieve balance by creating unique weapon mechanics: PPCs, LB-10X ACs, Pulse Lasers, LRMs",Thuraash,22, WR: PPCs divide their damage between 6 points of direct damage and 4 points of splash; LB-10X AC shells fire as slugs and fragment before hitting things

It's evidently very difficult to balance MWO weapons. A small tweak to a heat value or cooldown swings a weapon from complete irrelevance to total dominance, and cooldown values.

**PPCs**

The clear flavor of the past few months, less high than before but still rather high DPS, and reasonably good heat efficiency for the non-ER variants. At 7 tons apiece, they should certainly be powerful weapons, but right now the dominant strategy is to simply stuff as many of them as possible into a CTF, STK, or HGN

To make PPCs simultaneously more interesting and better balanced, and the rest spreads to surrounding components.

By way of rough guide

*Edit: Perhaps adjust to 7 direct with 3 splash

This creates an interesting dynamic: the weapon itself is a highly precise instrument. Unlike a laser, however, is not precise and necessarily spreads from the point of impact. This allows the PPCs to maintain their high damage output, and therefore remain very useful weapons, without being overpowered. This also creates a unique niche for the Gauss Rifle as the only weapon capable of dealing a pinpoint 15 damage at extreme range.

**LB-10X ACs**

Fixing LB-10X ACs by continually tightening the spread will never work. One ton is pretty much chump change when dealing with 10-caliber ballistics, i.e., when it IS the AC/10. One of them will be redundant, no matter which numbers you tweak.

Making the LB-10X viable without breaking the AC/10, and number pushing isn't going to be enough. Instead, much like BT does, have the shell launch as a slug, just like the AC/10 does, then break into pellets whenever it detects a solid object within 90m ahead of it. This way, the 540m range is actually usable

**Pulse Lasers**

This one is very simple. Have them actually function like pulse lasers. Instead of doing their damage in 20 or so tiny bursts like they do now

**LRMs**

These probably need the most work. As multiple LRMageddons have shown us

* *Overheat Breaks Lock:* This one is a no-brainer. If an LRM asset overheats, and still have them connect is crazy.

* *Implement Missile Acceleration:* You don't want LRMs to be near insta-hit weapons at short range. You also don't want them to take fourteen seconds to hit a target at long range. The solution is missile acceleration. Missiles launch slow, and decreases time to impact at long-range, making LRMs more effective at the range they're designed to operate at, and less effective at shorter ranges.

* *Change the Targeting System:* Right now, you need to keep your reticule over some VISIBLE part of the enemy 'mech. It has to be on the 'mech itself, and not simply in the box. If your reticule slips off the target, you've got a quarter or half second grace time to bring it back on (which doesn't progress lock acquisition), or you have to start over. 

*Edit:* Just to be clear

*Edit 2:* Perhaps a better change to the targeting system would be to implement two layers of lock. Let's call them a ""soft-lock"" and a ""hard-lock."" Simply placing the reticule inside the target frame like we do now can acquire a soft-lock. This could be represented by a lock indicator that flashes between yellow and red. Hard locks would be represented by red lock indicator

LRMs fired on a soft lock take the super-dispersed firing pattern, with full guidance capability and proper flight patterns. Or... you could just do away with the soft-lock entirely and make the hard-lock be the ONLY type of lock. */edit 2.*

*Edit 3:* See light warfare discussion at bottom. */edit 3.*

* *Indirect Fire Requires Teamwork:* Having a teammate simply target an enemy should not be enough to acquire an out-of-LoS. In order for missiles to fly, and NARCs should lose their damage cap, or at least have it substantially increased.

*Edit: Alternative (credit to Epitaph):* Instead of outright requiring TAG/NARC support

*Edit 2 (credit to /u/Autoxidation):* NARCs could bestow the side-benefit of allowing missiles to fly fire-and-forget to the target

* *Fix Missile Tubes:* Right now, and why CPLT-A1s can launch upwards of 40 missiles out of each 15 tube ear at once. Once a missile tube has been used, it should be reserved for the full cooldown of the weapon. Also, salvo intervals need to be increased to half the weapon's cooldown or, if that's not workable, to two seconds. That way, the most you can fire out of a 6-tube launcher is LRM-10 before you start firing for longer than it takes the weapon to cool down. This would bring boating under much more control

**Light Warfare Discussion**

The missile changes would create a potentially interesting dynamic for lights. Getting a streak lock would now be quite difficult, however, will allow friendly lights to acquire a hard-lock as they do now, by just holding their reticule in the frame. Thus, in order to get easy streak locks, the NARC asset needs to be a good enough shot to land an unguided missile on the target, and by doing so confer a huge tactical advantage to the lance. This comes at the cost of one asset in the light lance having to give up a streak launcher for a NARC. 

Enemies may then choose to focus down the NARC asset in the lance early,,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1370065584.0,,True

Then they added ECM, and be the only one, on both teams, not in a 3l.  This, is when I took my 1st break from the game.

In the past couple months they have put out some great patches.  they fixed the lag shield that made lights un-hittable, is what has led to the current long range/sniper tactics, and not the addition of the new highlander and Trebuchet mechs. 

Right now, move and communicate"", just like in the M-1 Tanker manual.  Establish defensive lines, cover avenues of approach, set up primary, secondary, and tertiary fighting position.  Hold off your opponent, and capture the enemy base.

**Pre-Match Lobby to Meet your Team**

A pre-match lobby (""dropship"") would make this situation a whole lot better. It gives you 45s or so to chat with your teammates, and equipment they have selected, and see what map is next. This will allow some some very basic teamwork and organization, where players can decide who they'll cover or run with, what cap points they'll go for (vs. either zerg-herd or scatter), and come up with very basic strategies or plans.

**'Mech Selection in the Dropship**

A great feature would be to allow you to have access to all four of your ""selected"" 'mechs in the dropship, and your battleplan. The game already has the four selection slots, so this feature would go along with that great.

**Lance Selection**

If PGI implements the dropship

Lance-members would be highlighted in neon green instead of blue on the HUD, since they can quickly find one. It creates a layer of organization to allow the team to function as a set of two or three lances instead of just one disorganized swarm. 

Being able to name the lance would be awesome

**Best of 5 (Campaign) Mode**

Another feature could be for matches to be a ""best of 3"" or ""best of 5"" instead of single runs. Matches would run for a more satisfying length of time (~20-30 mins)

Each warrior has access to only their 4 selected 'mechs for the duration of the campaign. This can have lots of interesting impacts on gameplay.

Needless to say, with maybe c-bill penalties for repeat offenders (like more than 3 bailouts in a day). You also forfeit any c-bills and xp earned if you leave early, but still pay for damage (if R&amp;R comes back).


*Persistent Damage*

There are no repairs of internals, and only limited armor repair between rounds. 33% of each section's max armor sounds like a fair amount of armor repair for an emergency refit mid-campaign. This means you need to preserve your 'mech if you want it next round, or else drop with a damaged 'mech or choose another one.

*Strong team-building*

If you're only playing with people for one round, they're gone. This way, the team sticks together for longer, and gets to work together for longer.

*Competitive Play with ""Long Campaigns""*

For competitive play between merc groups or 8-man pre-mades (or even PUG players if there's enough interest), and it's a real possibility that some mechwarriors might have only damaged 'mechs (or NO 'mechs) left to choose from by the end of the campaign. To compensate, it might be a good idea to have ""escape zones"" at certain places near the edges of the map where players can run off the map to save their 'mechs. 

That sounds like an AWESOME mode for competitive/""serious"" play.

What do you all think?

**TL, see which map is next, and organize into lances would be AWESOME for PUG gameplay.

Also, and armor repairs only 33% of max points for that section per round.


**Edit:** [x-posted](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/89907-pre-match-lobby-suggestion-taking-a-page-out-of-lols-playbook/) to MWO Suggestions forum.

**Edit 2:** In retrospect, when a lost match goes from a fight for victory to loss preservation mode, where teams fight to hide their most valuable/slowest assets, and escort them off the field. Cutting off armies from routing also then becomes a concern for the winning team in terms of how and where they attack. What do you think?

##General
This is an interesting paradigm for a 'mech.  The variant determines which arm hardpoints you get

Also notice that none of the selected variants carries MASC.

The lightest 'mech yet will also be the most to benefit from the coming scouting bonuses.
Also with the coming tonnage limits I expect this 'mech to become the go-to when you need a scout

##LCT-1V = The Ballistic Variant
I can see the LCT-1V being the least used.

Machine guns are doing much

There will be the occasional AC-2 build


##LCT-3M = The Energy Variant
This will be the most common Locust.

The LCT-3M will serve as a light-weight
Note the lower module count

As this 'mech naturally carries AMS
An anti-missile scout would be quite an interesting option; it would scout at first


##LCT-3S = The Missile Variant
Why one missile hardpoint per arm and not two?
I admit it's possible.
However, makes me leary that they'd allow it.

Assuming this
As scout 'mechs tend to carry more modules and already be very agile

##General
The only (normally) jump-jetting 'mech of the Project Phoenix.  

The shoulder cannon is reminiscent of a left-handed Hunchback.
The lack of energy weapon slots seems to balance the mech against the HBK series.
This mech is also going to (mostly) follow the same pattern of Ballistic

##SHD-2H = The Ballistic Variant
As soon as I saw this 'mech's hardpoints
It's a 'mech with too little tonnage to make use of it's ballistic hardpoints.


This variant will not be loved by many.
Its most prominent role will be due to its C-Bill and Loyalty bonuses.


Expect variants that equip a Gauss Rifle with a PPC and SSRM-2's.

## SHD-2D2 = The Energy-ish Variant
Missile hardpoints are all over the 'mech and limited by both tube-count and critical space.
Don't expect to launch more than 10 missiles in a volley; this is the balancing factor. 


The extra ballistic hardpoint is only there to match the seven-hardpoints per variant count.
Otherwise, and FANG (no one uses the second ballistic slot!)

I expect the tiniest jumping 2x ERLL + Gauss 'mechs to appear from this variant... just barely.


## SHD-5M = The Missile-ish Variant
What to do with this 'mech...
I'm expecting that this will be an Trebuchet tribute 'mech.
The 20-tube hardpoints will be awesome for this.


However this 'mech will be plagued by number of defects
Despite more jump-jet ability, and mostly pointless dual ballistic slots.

##General
There's an elephant in the room with this 'mech
It's supposed to have a shoulder-mounted missile-barrel.  That would also greatly increase its target area.
Will we see the first instance of a 'special' target region?  If so


Note that only one variant of the Thunderbolt has the missile-barrel on the right shoulder.
Another has it on the left shoulder.
And the last one questionably has a missile-barrel at all.
All of the possibilities have been illustrated over the years.

The models for this 'mech will be very interesting


## TDR-5S
A typical heavy
I expect that this 'mech will give Cataphracts trouble.  More
If this 'mech is in anyway limited
Sadly


## TDR-5SS
This will be the energy-themed variant of the Thunderbolt.
It will also be a weird
One question is: ""Will it have a missile-barrel

## TDR-5SE
What a mess; very left-torso dependent.

I think it's a new attempt at a missile boat.  If the tubes are dynamic

The ability to jump may be its saving grace.  It should be able to carry enough energy weaponry make it a viable alternative to the energy-based variants of the CPLT-K2.

##General
I will quicky admit that this the Project Phoenix 'mech that I've had the most difficulty characterizing.  It just doesn't flow into obvious variants like the others.

##BLR-1G
This 'mech give along with the BLR-1S
I expect this will be balanced by a lack of agility and a generally tall profile

##BLR-1D
Frankly


It's a missile-less version
I've made my best guess


It's interesting that the ballistic and energy arms are reversed versus the BLR-1G.


Commentry is especially welcome here.

## BLR-1S
Holy missiles 'Mechman!  


Something to compare to the AWS-8R?  The tube count will really matter with this one.


If it turns out that all of the launchers are dynamic



### EDIT: 
Typos and Additional Thoughts

###General Engines

Another conversation that needs to be had is with regard to the engines these 'mechs are going to be best capable of using.

For two of them

The Shadow Hawk and the Thunderbolt are where the interest lies.  The ability to reasonably carry XL's

While there is no way to predict this with certainty
Several older chassis' have fallen into distinct categories.  'Mechs like the Hunchback and Centurion are notorious for needing to carry a Standard, one which the developers seem eager to correct, which only reinforces my suspicion.

There is constraint to what can be done though.  The models of the 'mechs only provide so much flexibility in assigning the dividing lines between torsos.  Going beyond that greatly reduces how intuitive it is to hit any given region, it would be disconcerting to see the damage register on the left arm or center torso.


##Thunderbolt Engines
If we accept the notion that the torsos should encapsulate their corresponding weapon mounts, invariably.  The provided artwork shows the left torso energy weapons mounted fairly close to center.  Dividing the torso at the point just beyond these yields a stick of a center torso.  This means Standard engines will by typical for this 'mech.

As any balancing factor, if a bit slow.  This has the positive effect of preventing it from instantly outclassing the Catapult and Dragon which rely on XL's to provide speed and weapon tonnage at the cost of absorbing the bulk of their damage to their core.

I expect Thunderbolts to be slower and more lightly armed than I initially thought

## Shadow Hawk Engines
This 'mech can go either way.  It really depends on whether or not the developers cut the side torsos to-the-inside or to-the-outside of the depicted heat-vents.

To-the-outside means a large center-torso

To-the-inside means larger side-torsos

Down-the-middle creates a more balanced 'mech.  While I would expect this will be the developers' goal

The Hotfix

What it addresses:
The insane amount of damage missiles started doing including splash damage and something weird that caused said splash damage to spike through the roof.

How it used to work:

(Note: I'm going to use the term 'secondary component' below but you can read it as 'a component that did not get hit directly but is taking splash damage')

All missiles used to have a 4.0m splash damage radius that took into account the percentage of the volume of secondary components engulfed in the radius. 

With the advent of smaller/tighter component groupings on the smaller Mechs

What does the hotfix do?
A number of things. First off

Any location directly hit by a missile takes the full damage. Any secondary component hit by the splash damage radius takes splash damage based on how far the location is from the center of the explosion.

We also added a scaling factor of 0.4 to the amount of damage done to secondary components. From the impact point to the outer radius of splash damage

But Paul
I know I did

Doing this exposed a problem with the grouping/clustering of missiles. We now have a high percentage of any incoming missile targeting the CT. This is BAD.

Now our primary concern as to what is happening on the live servers is to curtail the incredibly high damage levels of missiles/explosions. To make the missile explosions/damage feel like they should and to keep the damage spread across a Mech

LRMs drop from 1.8 damage per missile to 0.7 damage per missile.
SRMs drop from 2.5 damage per missile to 1.5 damage per missile.

DO NOT HIT REPLY TO FREAKOUT YET!

It is at these levels that missile combat falls back to a level that we AND the community felt was right for a long period of time before the badness appeared. I'm going to ask you to help us test these values by FEEL. Not by playing SpreadsheetWarrior.


Missiles are STILL a very big threat to the target but just aren't doing these chart topping damage numbers.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS MESSAGE:
This is a TEMPORARY fix to quell the damage done by missiles at this time. We are fully investigating the damage model AND focusing on the grouping of missiles and will update as soon as we can on how any changes will be managed/implemented.

Procedure:

1. Put a PPC back on my 'phract.

2. Enter a live match so we know for sure there are no training ground shenanigans. (sorry to the people in this match!)

3. Face a flat surface at 300m. (Flat so we know there are no convergence issues)

4. Take hands off wasd and the mouse

5. Hold space.

6.  When the JJ meter is even with bar in the throttle (for consistency)

7. Release space.

8. Repeat 5-7 a few times.

9. Get shot in the back as a nosy BJ finds you shooting at a wall.

10. Attempt to kill nosy BJ until his friends come up and finish you off.

Note that these are all the shots I took during the test

I've played a lot of games where if you aren't playing with the ""theorycrafted optimal"" build, there are very few ""wrong"" ways to skin a 'mech. 

Sure, experience, and a great deal of player skill. Ravens, Commandos, and Spiders may be the ""best"" light mechs, but [Jenner jocks still love their mechs](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/17au3o/the_jenner_is_awesome/)
 and contribute as much as anyone else. There are so many ways to skin a Cat', but the breadth of creativity and design afforded by the system is breathtaking, and the skill and ingenuity of this game's pilots are something worth saluting, and the designers who make it possible, worth commending.

I hope this isn't taken as a total qq post. I've been a loyal supporter of this game, and three Hero Mechs. I've also tried to be a voice of reason and supporter of PGI's efforts through the Great ECM Debate, 3rd Person View Affair, LRM'pocolyose, Consumable Fury, Maps and Mechs Can't Cost THAT much revolt, and the THIS ISN'T BETA issues on the official forums. 

While PGI has made amazing progress in a short time with this game, and while all of that is important and all, I need to see some attention given to the content I'm writing about. 

Content is very important in F2P games and we have some great content so far

The Highlander was released on Tuesday and I was VERY dismayed that there was not a Plaid camo pattern. Tartan would be acceptable.

UPDATE


Greetings MechWarriors

We have another great patch ready for you today.  It's packed full of content

The Trebuchet is now available in the MechLab.  We have been having some serious fun with this BattleMech in our play tests.  It’s great to have a new medium `Mech on the battlefield

What is Alpine Peaks you ask? It’s a huge map.  H U G E.  Bring your scouts

If you liked our New Year’s holographic cockpit items

On top of all this there are a lot of cool new improved features to play with. Personally I can’t wait to disable someone’s ECM with a PPC. Now I just have to put a PPC on one of my `Mechs.

See you on the battlefield 

Matt N

I'd like to clear something up for people who may not realise this: In any large software project involving multiple developers, you can't have 25 people work on it at once and complete it in two hours. The only thing you can do it split it into subprojects and have one or two extra people working on those, but the extra co-ordination within teams means doubling the number of people won't halve the time required: more like 60-75%.

I'm not sure how large PGI's development team is, QA etc.

This means that you can't just pull people off camo-specs and have them make levels; the skillsets may not be transferable and the level may already have all the modellers and texture artists it can support.

It means implementing new features takes place in parallel with fixing bugs in existing features

It means the matchmaker will take as long as it takes; pulling people off other projects won't make it go any faster.

Always remember [Brooks's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks's_law): ""Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.""

On a related note: The hardest part in fixing any bug is usually reproducing it. People say things like ""PGI *knows* about the 4FPS bug, blackscreen are all *intermittent*. They don't happen reliably every time you do a certain action, or if they do, they don't for everyone. There are a lot of factors that could possibly be causing this bug, or it could be many bugs with the same symptoms. The best way you can help is by reporting bugs whenever you see them, with as much information about the circumstances in which they occurred and the hardware and settings you are running as possible.

**EDIT**: I made this post to try and clarify why PGI often ""fail to deliver"" with their patches. It wasn't either defending or decrying their business model or QA process (about which we know little),False,self,t5_2t1w0,1353601278.0,,CR2,t3_13m8kq

What happened to the Orion? The factory had some issues with orbital bombardment... production of the Orion will resume once the factory can be rebuilt. These 'Mechs don't just grow on trees

Which reminds me of a joke. If a tree falls in a forest... you must not be playing MWO.

We also added a new Champion 'Mech and made it a trial at the same time. The HBK - 4P©. A nice loadout at a good price with a 10% XP boost. Try it then buy it.

UPDATE

Greetings MechWarriors.

  Death's Knell is here! With a 30% C-Bill boost that lets you make money while dancing around Atlai burning 
their armour off with four medium pulse lasers.  You know you will look good because this BattleMech has possibly 
the coolest Hero skin yet!
    
  All Systems are… Nominal? (we're getting there!) Finally!  the Bitching Betty start up sequence is in game!  If 
this doesn’t give you warm nostalgic feelings
 animations and functionality for overheat and shutdown.

  Some nice bug fixes round out the rest of this patch.  Thanks for your help in tracking down and squashing 
them!

    See you on the Battlefield
 
Matt Newman

    - Top Speed:  113.4 kph
    - Armor:  176
    - Weapons &amp; Equipment:
        - Left Arm:  2 Medium Lasers
        - Right Arm:  2 Medium Lasers

    - Hardpoints:

    - Heat Sinks:  11 Double
    - Jump Jets:  n/a
    - ECM Capable?:  No
    - Module Slots:  2
    - 30% C-Bill Bonus

New Trial Mechs:

    - Spider SDR-5V
    - Hunchback HBK-4SP
    - Cataphract CTF-3D
    - Awesome AWS-8V
	
Gameplay:

    - Start-up animation at the beginning of the match.
    - Normal power on/offs during gameplay now have animations.
    - Now able to manually shutdown during an override

Power System: (Powering on and off the Mech):

    - There has been a significant change in how the power system works in regards to powering on and off your Mech and when overheating.
    - Pressing the ‘P’ key will always turn on / off your Mech even if your Mech is shutdown from overheating.
    - Pressing the ‘O’ key will temporarily prevent the shutdown of your Mech due to overheat.
	
What does this mean exactly?

Pressing the ""O"" key just prior to overheating will temporarily disable the overheat Mechanic for the next 5 
seconds.  If you do not overheat in those 5 seconds
next time you wish to engage it.

If your Mech DOES overheat within that 5 second buffer
to start taking damage to your internals.

Pressing the ""P"" key now powers your Mech on/off no matter what state you are in.  Hence
key while you are overheated
you have cooled off sufficiently.

Performance:

    - Anti Aliasing is Disabled by default for low specs.
    - VSync off by default.
    - Optimized visibility checks.

Bug Fixes:

    - Fixed some issues with CryEngine.
    - Fixed a few memory leaks.
    - More fixes done to the FE.
    - NARC/TAG reward now shows up in the EoR screen.
    - Fixed texture LOD issue with the cockpit items.
    - Additional movement code bug fixes and improvements

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

What now? For now, sometime in the near future. For next time, we're going to borrow a setup that Goonfleet of EVE uses to broadcast special events, which will allow people to listen in without needing to deal with all the headaches of installing and shuffling into Mumble. We're also going to take a different approach to get questions from textchat into the discussion, something we couldn't effectively manage this time.

In particular, I'm a little unhappy we couldn't get more groups who were more or less happy or just ambivalent about the way the game is going, for contrast. I'm also unhappy that we couldn't get anyone who represented just themselves involved, both for logistical reasons and because of how we solicited speakers. Do you have something to say for next time, good or bad? We want to hear it.

To keep the conversation going in the meantime, however you feel it's going at the moment. There's no good general chat for MWO, so we wanted to step up and offer some of our extra infrastructure capacity to everyone.

----------------------------
--------

**Lights:** 

**Primary Functions: Scout

**Scout**: As a scout, if you see/hear something moving, call it out. Hopefully your team will respond in kind. As a PUG, don't count too much on have a TAG. LRM's are popular, but let the LRM boats worry about their own tags. UAV's help enough as is. 

**Diversion**: Cap

**Light Swat**: As a light

**DO NOT**: 

**Be slow** - If you're going to be slow

**Be Silent** - As a scout

**Brawl** - Jesus Christ, go sit on cap. Never brawl. If I see a light that's brawling, I'll shoot you myself.  

**Go Alone (If you can help it)** - Work with your other lights. Strength in numbers. If you go alone, you're toast. I get it, sometimes, you're the only light. I play that role a lot. If you do, never directly engage unless you have a clear advantage. 

-----------------------------------------
**Mediums** 

**Primary Functions: Support

**Support**: As a Support unit

**Heavy Hitting Skirmisher**: CN9-A with 3xSRM6 running by you at 100 KPH or a Hunchie with an AC20. It's about hitting hard and running away. You can't soak up the damage your bigger brothers can take. Shoot

**Light Swatting** - This is just like the lights, LBX10s. These are the weapons of choice. Go for the everything. They're carrying XL's always.Shoot for the biggest portion until they're dead. If you can reliable hit the legs, do it. Your team will sing your praises when they can finally have those ankle bitters off their asses. 

**DO NOT**

**Be Slow** - You're biggest benefit is that you can fit heavier hitting things than a light

**Go Alone** - Same with lights, but you'll be the fire support in any situation.  

**Be afraid to take Damage** - That's your role. You take damage and keep ticking as long as you can to allow the bigger guys to get their shots. Draw the Aggro

---------------------------------------------

**Heavies**

**Primary Functions: Damage Dealers

**Damage Dealers** - High Alpha. As high as you can make it without sparing armor and speed. There's a reason you see 2xPPC's 1xGuass on a Cataphract. It's High Alpha, but they've got the teeth to tear a bear to shreds. More Ballistics and Lasers, the better.

**Fast Brawlers** - I'd recommend no XL engines but I've seen it done. They are piloted like a Medium, die gloriously if you have to. Brawlers don't typically live long if it's a hot brawl, but like a Med, use your torso twist, protect your big guns, and do work. 

**Support** - LRMS, assaults, lights in that order. Take a god damn tag with you, don't blame other players for not holding targets if you're too stupid to get your own. 

**DO NOT**

**Go Alone** - Do you see a Theme here? 

**Misplace your shots** - Heavy pilots have to be the best shots in the game. They can't take the ammo an assault can. Use your damage wisely and make the most out of each shot. 

**CHASE THE SQUIRREL** - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

-------------

**Assaults**

**Primary Functions: Damage Dealers

**Damage Dealers** - Deal out as high as damage as you can. Target other assaults and heavies and just go to town. Don't bother trying to rack up a bunch of kills. They'll happen if you do your job. It warms my heart to see an astronomical amount of damage from an assault but only 1-2 kills and 6-7 assists. Leave the heavies or Mediums to finish off the task  if they're close. Call the targets out. Do work.

**Support** - LRMS again. Same thing with Heavies. Take a tag, no one will notice. They'll just think you rolled them without any effort, but really it was your ass providing all the cover and support they needed. 

**Brawling Tank** - I'm awful at this, and AC20's I know I'm about to see a fucking show. It's high energy, high kills, high damage, and die in a blaze of glory. They've become somewhat less known since the release of the bigger maps, but they still have their uses for sure. 

**DO NOT**

**Be afraid to take damage** - You're a giant sponge. Take the damage and move from cover to cover. 

**Know your role and strengths** - Long range support

**Go Alone** - You will always be the center of attention in a match, because you know you raged at seeing that stupid shit. Stick with your team, be a damage sponge.  

-------------------------

**Words of Advice**
When building a mech

Communication is key for this game and although PGI has their thumbs up their ass on how to communicate effectively with team mates it still has to be done. Once you're in a clan or organization that has a TS, communicate. Lead if you have to. Most are clueless on what to do, and if you suggest a strategy, most will follow. 

You know what, but the inability communication effectively right now kills any type of momentum you'll have. Most PUG groups that win have a team of 4 who are communicating, so join one and start having a better time. (If you haven't already)

1374689687.0,1iyyzt,How could PGI incentivise non-combat roles on the battlefield?,ataraxic89,42,7,84,"IMO this is a gigantic problem with the game. There is no serious benefit to anything but shooting the enemy. 

I am mostly talking about assault here but conquest is actually far more affected by the lack of incentive to capture and defend. PGI mistakenly thought the concept of capping = more resource points would make people want to cap. This is obviously not true to anyone who has ever played a video game. 

The role of the information warrior is entirely non existent. We can get a very minor bonus for spotting an enemy that is then damaged by a team mate within some time (I think). However

Sometime I will run out to scout in my spider and have my leg 1-shot off upon first contact. On top of that my team will probably not shoot the enemy anytime soon so I wont even get a bonus for finding out where the enemy is. 

Some ideas for information warefare rewards: 

* Cbills = number of friendlies under your ECM * time. This would be a small number but would be continuous (next to nothing for just 1 person

* ECM kill assist bonus. Kills made by teammates under your ECM gives you a bonus. 

* Much better spotting bonus mechanics. Often when I find the enemy I quickly press R to let the friendlies know where a bunch of them are. I feel this is kind of rigged

* ECM counter bonus. Extra spot bonus for countering ECM  carrying mechs then being the one to spot them. I dont think this should include PPCs because they are a weapon first, BAP, tag, narc. Not sure if UAV should be included as to avoid a consumable = guaranteed cbills.

Thats just some idea

Keep in mind that your idea should actually be possible. It cant magically give you a bonus for looking like you might be spotting.

3. Community Sites can then build their own Leagues
4. PGI can track traffic trends and give their marketing department better statistics for better ad placement

##Feature 3: Replays and Internet Streaming
1. Player streams are now gaining more traction
2. Replays give them the tools to break down historic matches
3. MWO Commentators are now able to build quality coverage
4. Replays allow the community to post tutorials and guides on youtube

##Feature 4: Community Warfare
1. Everything PGI is planning with community warfare goes here
2. Understand which Galactic battle site is working the best
3. Simultaneously work with and compete against the community sites to revolutionize the game

##Feature 5: Arena Combat
1. Can even make it Solaris themed arena type combat
2. In house ranking structure for various drop types (1v1, etc)

**On** the first day of Patch-mas my true love gave to me, DUN! That’s right a new game mode available on every map. You can explore new strategies on this mode over the holidays and let us know what you think. We will be looking to tune it in the new year based on your feedback and the data we will collect. We know you are going to want to try it right away so we added mode selection, allowing you to choose which game type you want to play.


**On the second day of Patch-mas**, because you no longer have to repair and rearm, you keep what you earn. BE WARNED you have to contribute to your team to earn C-bills. We also changed Trial BattleMechs to earn 100% C-Bills and Mech XP. Lastly, There is no better time to invite your friends to play, we added the Cadet bonus for the first 25 matches to accelerate a new players ability to buy their first BattleMech.


**Speaking of BattleMechs**! Get ready for the triple threat! The new, with patterns that send fear into the heart of your enemy and a C-bill boost that will send you laughing all the way to the bank. Wait, we didn’t stop there! Introducing The Stalker. Here is what Kyle L. had to say about this Assault class BattleMech. “It’s the blimp ‘o’ death bro!... It’s like the Hindenburg except everyone else is going down in flames!”. Well put my friend...well put. You can also take a look at the latest BattleMech patterns. We have expanded the options and the Phranken is sure to please.


**Get ready to battle in River City night version**. I mentioned it earlier and we delivered! Finally a night map where night vision is effective!  I love this map and I know you will too.


**Finally**, the Urbanmech is a must buy!
We hope you notice we have taken your feedback on pricing and offered the new year’s items at a variety of price points!


We also addressed some key performance and stability issues this patch and we are testing new networking code over the holidays that we are looking to release in January. During test some users noted much improved performance with latest graphics drivers so please if you experience performance issues ensure you are running the latest graphics drivers for your card. Also there is a suspected issue with the patcher we are continuing to investigate where performance for some users is lower when patching vs. a fresh re-install if you suffer from low fps and new drivers don't resolve the issue please try a fresh install as a workaround for now.

So have a safe and Happy Holidays and as always

Matt Newman

P.S. This is our last planned patch this year so we will resume our “normal” patch schedule in January

**NEW MAP**

    * RiverCity Night Map
        * RiverCity Night map enabled.
		
**NEW GAME MODE**

**Conquest**

      With the rumblings and rumors of activity
      amassing large amounts of Germanium.  Germanium is used in the jump drives of the large jump capable 
      ships that transport Mechs over long distances.  The unsettling atmosphere that has permeated throughout
       the InnerSphere has Germanium at an all time high in terms of demand.  It is now time that all 
      MechWarriors pitch in to help in this cause.

    * Conquest Mode enabled.
    * Gather resources by capturing resource extractor points.
    * 5 extractor points per map.
    * Each team starts with 1 extractor in their possession.
    * The more extractor points owned by a team
    * Once a team reaches 750 resources
    * A team can still win by destroying all enemy Mechs.
    * Win or Lose
      750 resources
    * Known Issue: There is a problem with Conquest resource rewards not being issued if players/groups select 
      ""ANY"" as the game mode.  If you wish to play Conquest
      ""Conquest"" from the game mode selector.  This will be address in the next patch.

**NEW NEW YEARS COCKPIT ITEMS**

    * Champagne Glass
    * Top Hat

**BANNER ADDED**

    * Piranha Hunt 'Killed a Dev' banners have been added to the winner's accounts - congratulations!

**NEW REWARD SYSTEM**

	  The reward system has gone under a serious revamp.  We are removing the Repair and Rearm costs 
      from the game and rebalancing how many C-Bills you will be earning.  We are also reducing the amount of 
      C-Bills you earn by default for a win/loss/tie.  Non-participation in matches will result in very low C-Bill 
      income.  That being said
	  Below is a detailed summary of the changes to the reward system:

    * All mechs will be fully repaired and rearmed after every match at no cost.
    * Trial mechs get the same rewards as normal mechs (even mech XP)
    * New Bonus called Cadet Bonus: this bonus is rewarded to new users for 25 games. The math is calculated 
      by: log10(gamesremaining) * 300

        * This means you will receive 424
      played 25.
        * After 25 matches you will have received a total of 7
        * If you have already played more than 25 matches,686 C-Bills as a lump 
      sum (Happy Holidays!) If you've played under it

    * Removed Capture Win/Assist CBills Bonus
    * Spotting Assists will now only be given if spotted target takes damage from allies

Assault Rewards:

    * Win/Loss/Tie = 25
    * Team Kill = -10
    * Component Destroyed = 2
    * Enemy Kill = 5
    * Enemy Kill Assist =7
    * Spotting Assist = 2
    * Damage Done = 25 * how much damage you did in the match
	
Conquest Rewards:

    * Win/Loss/Tie = 25
    * Team Kill = -10
    * Component Destroyed = 1
    * Enemy Kill = 2
    * Enemy Kill Assist = 3
    * Spotting Assist = 1
    * Damage Done = 25 * how much damage you did in the game
    * Resource Bonus = 25 * how many resources you have collected

**MECHLAB IMPROVEMENTS**

    * Heat sink entry in both new Mech detail panel and current Mech detail panel now shows Dbl Heat Sinks
      when double heat sinks are equipped
    * New BattleMech list now organized by class (Hero, Heavy, Assault)
	
Jump Jets:

    * Removing Jump jet override (now using actual jump jet loadout restrictions)
    * Now enforcing and showing maximum number of jump jets as well as current number equipped on a Mech
      chassis.
    * Added Jump jet bar showing maximum jump distance for current configuration (if a Mech is capable of 
      using jump jets)
    * What this all boils down to is that the number of Jump Jets on a Mech will now properly affect jump 
      height/distance.
    * Players will notice a change in the overall jump trajectory. This will be tuned in future patches.
	
Modules:

    * Now showing how many modules the BattleMech is capable of in the new Mech detail panel
    * Now showing module slots available and currently equipped modules in the current Mech detail panel
    * Both of the above automatically adjust when Master status is achieved (extra slot is added)

**GAMEPLAY**


    * ECM will now fully counter only the closest enemy Mech.
    * Cockpit Camera shake intensity adjusted to be more realistic  (Shake = Damage * Impulse)
    * HUD will no longer flicker unnaturally when shot with machine gun fire and flamers beyond a certain 
      damage threshold
    * Player can now control the brightness in the cockpit using (.) period.
    * There is now a 3 second delay at the end of the match before the End of Round Screen shows.

Weapons Tunning:

    AUTOCANNON UPDATE:

    * AC/20 projectile set to 900m/s (750m/s previous)
    * AC/10 projectile set to 1100m/s (850m/s previous)

    NARC BEACON UPDATE:

    * NARC lifespan increased to 20 seconds (15 seconds previously)
	
    TAG UPDATE:

    * TAG range increased to 750m (450m previously)

    PPC UPDATE:

    * PPC projectile speed increased to 2000m/s (matches AC/2) (1200m/s previous)
    * ERPPC projectile speed matched to regular PPC (2000m/s) (1200m/s previous)
	
    ARTEMIS UPDATE:

    * Artemis now requires line of site to function.  In-direct fire will not benefit from Artemis.
	
**PERFORMANCE FIXES**

IMPORTANT: Please remember to update to the latest graphics drivers if you are having FPS issues and ensure that you are running low settings with V-Sync disabled and if that doesn't work try a fresh re-install.

    * 10% faster ray traces
    * Reduced number of client side ray traces Mechs require
    * Shadows disabled for low settings
    * Foliage swaying disabled for low and medium settings

    * Refresh MechTree Categories whenever mech ownership changes
    * Refresh PilotTalents when GXP Changes via MXP conversion
    * Weapon bay door toggle SFX will no longer play when a mech does not have weapon bay doors
    * Fixes most issues with penetrating LRM’s (projectiles in general) through static meshes
    * Jump Jet effects will no longer float around unattached
    * Weapon Bay doors will no longer float unattached

Update

Greetings MechWarrior’s and welcome to Open Beta Update 4!

We have some exciting things to talk about in this patch, but  Founder's premium time will now be reset and banked allowing you to activate it when you desire. This won’t stop you from purchasing premium time right now and activating your founders time later. Any of the bonus XP and C-bills you earned while your premium time was active are retained.

Next up we have Frozen City Night. This relight of the Frozen City map changes things up by creating long clear sightlines and some cool new effects in the sky. It may not be a night map that requires Night vision but that will be in another patch. ;)

I can’t talk about Visual Customization without giving props to Mark Hayden

It doesn’t stop there either

Last but not least BITCHIN’ BETTY is in the game! Yes that is Carrol Ruggier’s voice, start-up sequence, *cough*), and some more system refinement, but we just couldn’t make you wait any longer!

Lastly, and bug fixes. This is the heart of any great game and we are committed to getting the best experience we can for our players. Some things take longer to turn around.

See you on the Battlefield!

- Matt Newman


VISUAL CUSTOMIZATION

Players will now be able to customize the outer visual looks of their BattleMechs.  This includes applying patterns and adjusting the colors that make up those patterns.

    * Patterns - Patterns are made up of color elements which give them a unique look when applied to a BattleMech.  Not all Mechs have skins available to them.  Check out the matrix in the link below to see what is currently customizable.
    * Paint Colors - The colors that can be applied to a Pattern are broken down into channels.  Each pattern has from 1 to 3 channels.  Colors can be changed on any channel that is available for the chosen Pattern.
    * Cockpit Items - Items can now be purchased for the player's BattleMech cockpits.  More items are being implemented and they will be coming out soon.
	
For more in-depth detail on Visual Customization

With this

LEVEL

    * Frozen City Night
      Dropped into what once was the city centre of a thriving metropolis, to the moonlit night effects, you will have to be much more careful about checking for enemies; the fog has dissipated however.

As with normal frozen city, more intense battles with less chance of overheating your mech.

GENERAL

    * An “Activate” button has been added to the main screen allowing Founders to activate their banked premium time.
    * The following applies to Founder's Accounts ONLY:
        * Your premium time is now zeroed out.
        * If you have purchased premium time with MC during Open Beta
        * Once the ""Activate"" button is clicked
        * Again, your remaining purchase time and your Founder's time will be combined.  (i.e. you will not lose any Premium Time).

WEAPONS

    * LRM damage has been increased from 1.7 to 1.8 per missile.
	
GAMEPLAY

    * Bitching Betty v 1.0

            * a location on your Mech has been destroyed
            * a weapon has been destroyed
            * a weapon's ammo is at 25%

            * a heat sink has been destroyed
            * jump jet fuel is at 25%
            * jump jet fuel is empty

BUG FIXES

    * Fixed a desync that could occur when a Mech had a destroyed leg.
    * Users will no longer have a blurry screen after they die.  This was caused when a user would die from a missile.
    * Users will only be able to launch one game client now.

KNOWN ISSUES

  MechLab:

    * Newly bought Cockpit Items are not always automatically equipped on Mechs.

    * Colors cannot be changed on default patterns of the Commando
    * After purchasing MC
        * Restart your game client after Purchasing MCs.

    * Camo Spec color palette may incorrectly display previous colors after changing patterns and coming back to re-change colors.
    * Selecting Cockpit Tab too quickly after saving Cockpit settings may lock the camera outside of the Mech.
    * The two first Mech Bays you purchase will not immediately accept new Mechs.
        * Select another working Mech Bay and then your newly purchased Mech Bay will function normally. 

  Ingame:

    * Bitching Betty is missing certain prompts and repeats “AMS ammo at 25%”.
        * Targeted by enemy
    * Frozen City Night can have red/green sky textures in low settings with certain system specs.

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

A few minutes ago, I could see an ambulance with lights on apparently not moving at a distant intersection on a hill. Curious as to why it's not moving, I start to engage my zoom out to 1.5x or even 3.0x if necessary...when I realized I wasn't sitting in my 'Mech cockpit.

Greetings MechWarriors.

Hard to believe it's March already! Especially since I am writing this in February.

March is going to be a big month for us and we are starting things off with a guaranteed new favourite hero Mech, you know for shooting missiles and stuff. With superb piloting skills this thing is going to pwn. Just check out those hardpoints and start your scheming. A Hero Mech so good I didn't feel the need to mention the 30% C-bill boost? WOW

Speaking of hardpoints, heatsinks, equipment and available slots. Now if you could just remember where you put that XL 320 engine you bought.

Since you just spent 20 minutes tweaking your build

Hey you!... Yeah you! You don't have enough stuff in your cockpit! But you are in luck because we have NEW hanging cockpit items using the ""Real Hula Girl PhysicsTM"" engine. Repeatedly alpha striking and shutting down is sweaty work but my cockpits smells 75% better now that I bought and equipped an ""Air freshener"" in all my Mechs. You should too!

Read on for the rest of the tuning and fixes included in the latest patch.

See you on the battlefield

Matt Newman.

1373432973.0,1hzmb2,Guide to using a Flight Stick,TheTucsonTarmac,34,5,34,"Shortly after discovering MWO

Recently, I decided to give it another try.  

The Stick:  I'm using a 10 year old Saitek Cyborg Evo.  This stick features a hand rest that can be moved from side to side, so that you can place then in a natural position.  If your stick is a right hand only model (like the ThrustMaster Loc-Nar showed in his cockpit), it will not work.  I do not know if Saitek still makes this model, but a quick check of Ebay showed them going for $10-20.

Previously, so I secured the stick to my desk top with some scrap wood and clamps.  I added a armrest, made out of packing foam and gaffers tape, for comfort.  I hope to come up with a cleaner mount later, but this works fine.

I then spent a couple hours in the testing grounds trying to set it up, in place of the WASD buttons.  Pushing the stick forward accelerates the mech, pulling back puts it in reverse, and just letting stops you.  You don't need to use the ""full stop"" button with the stick.
I am not using the ""torso twist"" option
 My goal was to make it so that the only reason I had to take my hand off the stick was to type in the chat.  After much trial and error

* Trigger:  AKA button 0 toggle zoom
* Center bottom thumb:  AKA button 1:  Strategic overlay (show names)
* Left bottom thumb: AKA button 2:  Toggle weapon chain fire (normally backspace)
* Right bottom button: AKA button 3:  Next Target
* Left top button:  Center Torso
* Right top button:  Jump jets
* Analog throttle:  Axis Y
* Analog turn: Axis X

The center top of the stick has a 8 position ""D-pad""

* D-pad up: Override
* D-pad down: Show scoreboard
* D-pad right: Map
* D-pad left: Center legs

IMPORTANT!  I never used the ""center legs"" button when playing with a keyboard, and (if I'm in a mech with them) jump jets.  This lets me push the center legs button quickly, with a tap of my thumb, and gets my legs aimed where I am looking.   Great for fast escapes, or just going across that bridge without falling off.

The stick has 6 buttons on it's base, arm lock, etc.   Flavor to taste.  The throttle, which I can't use due to my ghetto mount,  should be used for weapon group 5/TAG.  The stick twist, normally used for rudders, is not used.

I put together a little demo video to show you what it's like.  I used one of the fastest, figuring that if it worked with that, it would work with an Atlas, and everything in between.

http://youtu.be/naJHfXQskOc

Conclusion:  When I started this, I wont use it.""  I'm happy to report that it works just as good as the WASD, and in some respects, notably the ability to make turns at less then 100%, it's better.

Comments and feedback (except from CeaseToHope ;p) are welcome.  Enjoy.

Hello cadets!

TheMightyWashburn here to give you some helpful tips. (Credentials: playing since closed beta

First off Ill address your questions directly then add what I think you should know.


* Good starter mech: I strongly suggest that you choose a weight class based on how you *want* to play and not on what is easiest. Whether you choose an atlas or a spider you will probably suck for about the same length of time. That said, and stragglers. Heavies and assaults play similar overall and are the primary core of a team as far as both damage output and absorption. Dont get me wrong, lights and mediums often do as much damage, but cant stand toe to toe like assaults do. 
* Close and medium range is
* Sweet spots: The head is the weakest target, engine (CT with std, CT, RT, or LT in XL engines) or destroy both legs. Almost all mechs carry far less armor on their back than on their front making this the optimal target. Note: there is no way to see if someone has an XL engine visually. However, many pilots choose them for the weight reduction. Virtually all Centurions have them, along with many lights.
* Balancing: This depends so much on the specific mech and what range you are going for on this build. I personally try to set it up so that all my weapons work well at a certain distance I plan to use the mech at. So I wouldn't equip LRMs (long range missiles) to a brawler. or conversely small lasers on a ER PPC boat arent even worth having as every weapon reduced heat efficiency even when not being fired. This actually brings me to a critical point about making an effective mech. *You do not need to use every single hardpoint to make an effective mech.* Double heat sinks are pretty much a mandatory upgrade in this game
* Finally Id like to add some important skills to focus on: *Fire Discipline* This is the ability to stay calm and wait to shoot when your shots will do the most. This includes not shooting when you are brawling and would overheat upon firing. Also it means taking your time to get all of a weapons damage into the same exact place shot after shot. **THIS IS CRITICAL TO KILLING ENEMIES** Lasers shoot for 1 whole second and sweeping it wildly across them does next to nothing. You must hit the same hitbox every time even if that means taking shots waiting for the perfect time to fire. *Torso twisting* This is the habit of turning your upper body often so that each shot of your enemy hits a different area spreading the damage out. This is the counter to fire discipline. *Teamwork* Even if you are always with PUGs (pick up groups) you can work together simply by stay close to a mass of friendlies and picking a teammate and shooting what he is shooting, running beind their ""front line"" and try to chase it down even if they could never catch it. All the while the enemies atlases are now focusing firing on 1 friendly at a time and ripping your team to shreds. Dont do it, whether they are in a light or an atlas. Exception, if you are fast enough, try to stop a cap on your base, just stand in the square and try not to get shot till you get reinforcements. 

This was a very long PSA by your friendly medium mech master TheMightyWashburn :p

I see a lot of complaining about the size and what it means for capping issues. What I don't think that people are getting is that it seems this way because we are all used to playing an imbalanced game. 

Think about how many medium mechs you have seen in the last 2 months,  have gradually shifted the gameplay to the point where harder hitting and slower moving mechs, and speed of light ECM mechs were all that was viable. 

Enter the resurgence of the mediums: 

You can tell PGI knew what they were doing by introducing this map by looking at the other changes they prioritized to be implemented at the same time. Increased engine capacity and quirks/tweaks for existing mediums

We will all readjust. Medium mechs will be more fun to play now and so more people will drop with them. People will learn they have to coordinate in Alpine

 The demands of the maps themselves play a large part in the meta game and balancing the game will depend on knowing this fact. 

tl;dr The map will help rebalance the game by making Mediums useful again.

**Meet the Lightning G15

[Adridos on the MWO forums](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/116901-new-airstrike-bomber-model-anyone-seen-it/page__view__findpost__p__2330550) took [this nice screenshot of the Airstrike fighter model](http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/9158/beznzvulo.jpg).  Turns out that it's a [Lightning G15](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Lightning_(Aerospace_Fighter\))

**UAV Data**

I have a full dump of my observations [in this pastebin](http://pastebin.com/HAnvDzmq).  The TL;DR is

* The UAV is a consumable which lasts for 45 seconds and has a 240m sensor range by default.  It can be targetted at 180m
* It is able to use up to 3 waypoints (only if you upgrade it? this might be outdated text)
* Advanced UAVs (MC perhaps?) will last for 60 seconds and have a 240m Range.  There are references to it having a 2minute duration
* Pilot Talents grant the UAV 25% increase in sensor range (15000gxp)
* Three overall UAV types, UAV-A (Advanced, MC?)

**Squirrel Cockpit Item**

As mentioned in the [PAX East thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1b222o/my_unanswered_question_from_pax_east_and_a_bonus/)

**Cobra Skin**

Looks like we're getting a skin named Cobra!  Just some [placeholder localization data for it at the moment](http://pastebin.com/qj3QC8Em).

**Canyon Networks Minimap**

Looks like this was added in the last April patch

I've come to some conclusions and have a bit of advice to offer any other newcomers:

Overall conclusion: yes

I've been grinding for a LONG time since my cadet bonus expired and I've only got a hunchback and 3 million C-bills to show for it. It's currently kitted out with 1x L-laser 4 x M-laser 2 x SSRM2, but am not currently using artemis missiles. With this build, my hunchback hits 81kph and I was able to rinse 4 heavies when  I was the last one left on my team, before getting owned in the face by an atlas. Still, took the score from 3-7 against to 7-8 before the match was over. 

General tips for noobs:

* Don't bother spending c-bills to experiment with builds and such

* F-F armour is a waste of money and space. I switched back to normal armour and went for endo steel internals instead

* Learn to play with a light or a medium mech first

* Without using real money

* Group weapons in terms of arms and torso

* Upgrade your engine and double heatsinks before you do anything else to your mech. 

* You can take down assaults with a medium, this is only really possible if you can find an assault in relative isolation. Pick your fights wisely, again, speed is your ally. Don't be afraid to break off and pick a better fight.

* SSRM's are your friend if you want to face off light mechs. 

* You can't paint your mechs

* Winning a match with a few kill assists and kills will get you about 100

* Don't sell weapons you have decided you don't like

* Pulse lasers have a stupidly short range

* PUG's (pick up groups) are usually useless unless you communicate. Use the chat box. My only other advice would be to stick together with the main force for straight fight maps

Paying players are at a clear advantage in terms of equipment advancement

If anyone has any tips on getting more c-bills quickly then I'd love to hear it

The camera angle is actually fine

It appears arm lock is permanently on for 3pv

I'm not sure how tweaking the FOV affects the 3pv camera

The reticle jumps up and down with your mech's steps

Side note: Capping take much longer in 12v12 now

Just watched a lovely argument between Bryan Ekman and one of those ""why don't you have the whole team working on HSR?"" idiots. 

IDEA: Make transition time from 3pv to 1pv longer to avoid abusing it for corner peeking. That way by the time you're back in shooting mode

Edit to poptarting: While it may not be useful for aiming, they know you're there too because of the drone, but that just means brawlers have to avoid that area.


Final impression:
In its current implementation, 3rd person cannot be included in them (Hardcore mode is already listed in the game types on the test server). Yes, this will split the player base, but it seems like we have enough players to handle that. Counter-Strike seems to do fine with a heavily split playerbase.

Potential fix:
Use a system similar to mechwarrior 3's camera:

1371016786.0,1g6hn5,Extreme alpha is the problem. NOT boating.,Decaysa,53,23,153,"The fix proposed by PGI in the latest development update will be ridiculously easy to game. Hell the current 3 PPC + 1 gauss builds already avoids it. My favorite build on the 4P already dodges it with 3 large lasers and 6 mediums. Once it's in place we'll quickly find other ways of doing abusive alpha. 

I propose a different solution:

Simply calculate the alpha base damage D;

if D &gt; 30 

calculate the excessive damage E = (D - 30);

Calculate heat penalty P = (1 + c*E) where c is a balance constant.

Now the heat generated by the alpha is multiplied by P.

--------------------
An example with (c = 0.03): 

3 ppc +  gauss firing is 45 damage;

So E = (45-30) = 15;
thus P = (1 + 15*0.03) =  1.45.

The heat generated by the alpha currently would be (3*8) + 1;
which is 25.

With the penalty it becomes (25*P) = 36.25.

-----------------------

This system would be both impossible to game and so much easier to understand. A simple new game tip can say:
Firing weapons with more than 30 damage total in less than 0.5 seconds will inflict heat penalties.

Patch Date - Thursday Oct. 25th @ 10AM – 1:30PM PDT
 
UPDATE
 
Another push towards Open Beta and we’ve been very busy.
 
Not only are there numerous fixes and improvements on existing systems, Endo-Steel Internal Structure and Double Heat Sinks are now in the game!
 
Ferro Fibrous armor is going to give you a bit more survivability on the battlefield; it is a little lighter
 
To accommodate these new additions in MechLab, you press “V” to activate it.
 
We've also made changes to the economy of the game.  Firstly, Mech costs being the sum of it's parts.  While it doesn't follow the canon pricing, it is close.
 
Pretty Graph
 
Graph of Mech Prices
 
As you can see, you get more value for your MC, as an Atlas AS7-D, for example, is not the same cost as an Atlas AS7-K. This helps reflect the fact that many variants have more sophisticated equipment, and thus are worth more. So to sum up: Average MC cost for Mechs is much lower, and there are spikes in MC cost for Mechs with advanced equipment.
 
The rest of the changes are in the patch notes below and we hope to see you take advantage of the new features in combat.  Now get out there and pop a Jenner!
 
P.S. Those of you who have purchased the December issue of PC Gamer will now have your Mech Skin and Coconut Monkey Bobblehead!

Engine heat sinks

    Engines with a rating of 275 or greater can contain one or more heat sinks inside of them without taking up critical slots.
    There is now a mechanism to add/remove these heat sinks (previously these heat sinks were fixed within the engine). The number of spots available and the number of spots taken are shown in the equipped engine
    When removing an engine
    The number of heat sinks the engine is capable of holding is the same regardless of whether the ‘Mech uses single or double heat sinks

New Upgrades tab - upgrades are options that affect the ‘Mech as a whole
 

    Armor (currently selectable are Standard and Ferro-Fibrous)
    Changing your armor type automatically replaces all of your armor with the new type
    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price for the conversion (based on max tonnage of the ‘Mech) plus the cost of whatever armor of the new type you need to buy. Having an amount of armor of the proper type in your inventory will therefore reduce the cost of the upgrade
    Armor types other than Standard take up critical slots (14 for Ferro-Fibrous). These slots will be floating (see below)

Structure (currently selectable are Standard and Endo-Steel)
 

    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price based on max tonnage of the ‘Mech
    Structure affects tonnage of the ‘Mech (Endo-Steel is lighter)
    Armor types other than Standard take up critical slots (14 for Endo-Steel). These slots will be floating (see below)

Heat sinks (select between single and double)

    Selects whether your ‘Mech may use single or double heat sinks. Only one type of heat sink may be used on a ‘Mech at a time
    Cost of the upgrade is a fixed price
    Engines are also automatically upgraded to double the heat sink capability
    When heat sink type is changed

Floating slots

    Some upgrades take up critical slots. These slots are auto-flowed into available empty slots
    If a floating slot appears in white
    If a floating slot appears in yellow
    Floating slots are ignored in the critical hit system

GAMEPLAY

    Running into another Mech will no longer knock it down.
    Line of sight check now higher on Mech so targeting can occur when only 25% of the mech is visible over a hill instead of 50% 
    Explosions explode on the surface of the water and spawn water explosion effects 
    AC/Gauss/PPC type weapons now pass through water and deal a reduced amount of damage depending on depth of the hit 
    Laser water hit effects spawn at the correct location on the surface of the water and deal a reduced amount of damage depending on depth of the hit
    Added Picture in Picture Zoom module. (Default mapped key for advanced zoom is 'V')
    Added Current active Vision mode status in HUD
    Extend range finder to 2500m( was 1500m )
    Cockpit light will now flicker after taking hard hits

MOVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS:

    Animation shaking under various circumstances
    ‘smoother’ jump jetting behavior
    Weapon hit detection more in-line with where you see the mech on your screen (don’t have to shoot infront of your mech so much) especially at lower frame rates were the problem was the worst.

BUG FIXES

    Two AMS on a Mech (AS7-K) now correctly destroy double the missiles
    PPC’s will no longer cross at extreme ranges
    Players are no longer able to zoom or change vision modes when a Mech is shut down  
    Zoom and Vision modes are tuned off when a Mech shuts down
    Target hit indication for missiles now correctly only goes off when explosion damage is dealt 
    Users can no longer specify an FOV less than 60.0 degrees in the user.cfg

We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/93716-the-recovering-light-mech-pilots-comprehensive-guide-to-things-that-can-one-shot-you/

I'll spare you guys the snarky tone, as well as in game.  AC20 cats and multi-PPC builds are dirt common in this game now, and there are TONS of ways to die in 40 damage or less.

here's the list:

Key: 

* Dual Gauss
* Dual AC20 or Quad-PPC (xx) 
* Hex-PPC only (x)

NOTE: this list doesnt include lasers or missiles as they are not 'instant kill' in the case of lasers, A1, etc)

ANY MECH IN THE GAME: Headshot (xx) (~33 HP)

Commando: 

* CT front - 24 armour
* CT rear - 8 armour
* ST front (XL) - 16 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 8 armour

Spider: 

* CT front - 30 armour
* CT rear - 10 armour
* ST front (XL) - 21 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 7 armour

Jenner/Raven: 

* CT front - 33 armour
* CT rear - 11 armour
* ST front (XL) - 24 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 8 armour

Cicada: 

* CT front - 36 armour
* CT rear - 12 armour
* ST front (XL) - 30 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 10 armour

Centurion/Hunchback: 

* CT front - 48 armour
* CT rear - 16 armour
* ST front (XL) - 36 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 12 armour

Dragon: 

* CT rear - 20 armour
* ST front (XL) - 42 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 14 armour

Catapult: 

* CT rear - 21 armour
* ST rear (XL) - 15 armour

This assumes 3:1 armour, so some of the 30HP and 40HP killshots may not work, but the message is the same.  Once the netcode/hit detection more accurately represents people's aim, light and medium mechs are going to be getting one-shotted - A LOT.

What a huge improvement!,qwortec,31,6,18,"I played two or three games when the last patch went live but haven't really touched it since then.  Last night me and a friend hopped on and went tanking around in Stalkers.  I didn't see many people talking about the changes on here in any significant way so I just assumed it was a minor thing.  I have to say that I was surprised by how much of an improvement the terrain mechanics have made in gameplay.

In some places it's subtle but the games we played last night (~8-10) were all much more dynamic than prior to the changes.  We had to put much more thought into how to move, etc. This led to some great ambushes (seismic is still a problem though) and some awesome use of drawing people into tunnels and off of high terrain (the river and bridge in Forest colony is actually tactical now).  

I can't wait to see how this gets evolved as they tweak it and when brawlers/mediums/lights finally make a comeback.

1370370296.0,1fo0e6,New Mech Announced: Quickdraw,Fireye,29,6,40,"They snuck this announcement in to the June 2013 Creative Director update:

&gt; `Mech of the Month - Quickdraw (18th)

The [Quickdraw is a 60 tonner](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Quickdraw)

* QKD-4G - The only long-range weapon carried onboard the Quickdraw is a Delta Dart LRM-10 launcher, two of which are rear-mounted and the other two (in the arms) giving it respectable close range firepower. Additionally, to capitalize on any weak points in an enemy's armor, the Quickdraw carries a Hovertec Quad SRM-4 launcher.

* QKD-C - The C is a modified version of the 5K Quickdraw. The 'Mech has had a Medium Laser removed and replaced with a C3 slave unit, BV (2.0) = 1,225

* QKD-4H - In an attempt to bring more direct firepower to the 'Mech,006, BV (2.0) = 1,242[9]

* QKD-5A - The 5A makes the Quickdraw a more effective close combat 'Mech. The LRM-10 launcher has been removed and in its place two more forward-firing Medium Lasers have been added, BV (2.0) = 1,196

* QKD-5K - The 5K Quickdraw is upgraded using Star League technology. The 'Mech carries the same weaponry as the 5A model. The heat sinks have been upgraded to double heat sinks and the armor carried is Ferro-Fibrous armor,170, BV (2.0) = 1,265

* QKD-5M - Another basic upgrade of the Quickdraw utilizing Star League technology, BV (2.0) = 1,237

* QKD-5Mr - This version uses ER Medium Lasers in the arms, and an Artemis IV FCS. To make room for this new equipment, engineers removed a heat sink and the one-shot missile launcher.[12] BV (2.0) = 1,465

* QKD-8K - The 8K variant of the Quickdraw brings it up to 3062 weapons standards. The 'Mech is built using an Endo Steel chassis and is armored with eight and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The 'Mech's arsenal has been stripped and upgraded. The 8K Quickdraw has four forward mounted ER Medium Lasers and also carries an MRM-30 launcher, BV (2.0) = 1,583

* QKD-8P - The -8P is based on the experimental -8X. The major differences are the removal of the Stealth Armor and the Head Turret. This reduces production costs considerably, remain. The 8P also uses the same handheld weapons as the 8X. BV (2.0) = 1,598

I hope that we see the QKD-C as our first Heavy mech to implement ECM.",self,t5_2t1w0,1370372136.0,,EXP,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1fo0e6/new_mech_announced_quickdraw/

If all goes well, but I will be able to give a calculation of how the game treats the ""Idle Heat"" of your engine. Unlike CBT, engines in MWO generate a nominal value of heat (which is why you see a non-zero percentage in Caustic valley, or in the crater).

1. Lance drops need to spread out. I've seen a lot of other users mention this as well. It's really bothersome to have a bunch of medium mechs surrounding me and making it difficult for my big-ass Quickdraw to move around properly. Also

2. A snipping or brawling match seems to be determined by map size. It took me a little bit to figure out why some matches I played last night evolved into sniping/lrm battles, Frozen City, and River City tended to turn into brawling matches. Obviously, this seems to be because there's so many mechs on the map now that you have to fight in close quarters on these small maps. Whereas big maps like Alpine and Mordor (Tera Therma) turned into sniping/lrm matches due to the distance between mechs. Canyon and Tourmaline seem to be a mixture of the two types of maps, especially Canyon. On those two maps, there seemed to balanced brawling and long-range combat. The question now is how PGI will balance out these maps--or if they will balance out these maps. Personally, as a brawler

3. LRM have become popular due to quantity, rather you're getting 4,5, maybe even 6 lrm boats in a team now. So, all of a sudden, you're getting a constant stream of lrm that the targeted mech simply has no way of escape from. A particular example was a match I had last night on Alpine. I was piloting my Quickdraw and peeked my head above the ridge, and then I was punished for almost nearly 20 seconds worth of an lrm barrage that I couldn't get away from--stripping me of my armor before the match had really begun. I think this is an issue PGI didn't think of for 12v12

4. Armor or internals should maybe made stronger now. Along with lrm barrages, and I think a lot of it is due to no one being able to move out from under cover because they'll be blown to pieces in a few seconds. Increased armor damage could be a solution for this if players know they can survive more hits to flank around sniping mechs and brawl them. I know this is something that has been talked about for awhile, and it may be time for it to actually happen.

Which brings me to the subject of this thread. Here, Podcasts, Streams, Command Chair Posts, Creative Director Updates, etc.

Even if it isn't much

1. To the competitive players leaving the game because of a lack of competitive support

2. The end game is definitely player/community run tournaments and leagues at the moment. These exist in majority of competitive games because the developers of the game did not organize the competitive play. They might have allowed in game features (lobbies, but in many games these things have been player-run and organized.

This is where I think PGI will differ. If I remember correctly

3. Regarding competitive player input, beta game that still has features like a lobby in development) competitive players do have great input regarding weapon balance and gameplay. This however, does not mean PGI should only take input from competitive players. Casual players matter as well.

So, but that does not mean the game is perfect, either. While PPCs and SRMs are being adjusted, other weapons such as the Large Pulse lasers and Streaks need to be reviewed again. 

**edit:** just got home from work, I am really excited about all the feedback this thread got. There are a lot of detailed discussions going on and I'm glad important information can be spread without a hostile argument.

1374387141.0,1iqm1h,What mech might we see next month?,CeaseToHope,37,13,79,"The old roadmap has reached the end of the road

Here's a list of the mechs PGI has to choose from. All of these mechs are timeline-appropriate, LAMs, etc.) I've added a bunch of stuff I've unearthed since last month, plus some of the new ex-Unseen (even though we won't see those until 2014).

Why isn't your favorite mech listed?

* It's based on concept art now owned by Harmony Gold in North America. A number of mechs are based on designs that were later used in Macross, or Zentraedi Battle Pod is out. No Wasp, Crusader, Warhammer, Marauder, and so on.
* It's a four-legged mech. PGI has said that they don't want to add these to MWO.
* It is introduced after 3052. In particular, and both Mechassault games are set well after the current period, and include many mechs that were invented as a response to the Clans, or to fight in later wars like the Fedcom Civil War or the Word of Blake Jihad. So no Owens, Templar, Fafnir, Bushwacker
* It's a Clan mech. PGI has enough on their plates right now without springing the Clans on us unexpected next month
* I've skipped all of the TRO 3058 and 3075 mechs that are described as extinct in 3050, Hammerhands, and Helepolis. There's a bunch of them, they're all goofy-looking, and nobody much likes most of them. It's possible that PGI could put them into MWO, but very unlikely.

**Complete list of Equipment and their Functions:**

* **TAG** - A TAG will provide the following benefits;
    * 50% bonus to missile clustering.
    * 50% bonus to missile targeting speed.
    * Lasts for 1 second per hit. Timer is refreshed after each hit.
    * Target locks against TAG'ed enemies decay 25% slower
    * TAG negates ECM on the targeted enemy.
    * Stacks with Artemis and NARC
    * TAG itself requires Line of Sight to apply bonuses.
    Bonuses do not require Line of Sight for Friendly Launchers.
    * Only works outside 180m from ECM.

* **NARC** - A NARC will provide the following benefits;
    * 100% bonus to missile clustering.
    * 75% bonus to to missile targeting speed.
    * Duration is until first of the following two conditions are met;
    Lasts for 15 seconds per hit. Timer is refreshed after each hit.
    Lasts until 40 damage has been dealt to enemy from missile sources. Damage is reset per Hit.
    * Stacks with TAG but not Artemis.
    * Works through ECM.
    * Allows all friendly mechs to target enemy regardless of Line of Sight.

* **Artemis** - Adding Artemis will apply the following benefits.
    * Requires 1 slot and 1 ton per LRM or SRM launcher.
    * Does not apply to Streak launchers. (Bug: Currently targeting speed will improve on streaks if an Artemis enabled launcher of another type is present)
    * Enables new Missile cluster pattern (75% tighter?).
    * 25% bonus to LRM targeting speed.
    * Requires Line of Sight to target for LRM benefits to apply.
    * Stacks with TAG.
    * Overwrites NARC bonuses even without Line of Sight

* **BAP** - BAP will enable to following benefits;
    * 25% bonus to target acquisition range
    * Allows targeting of shutdown enemies within 120m
    * 25% bonus to acquiring target information details
    * Will cancel enemy ECM within 150m

* **ECM** - ECM provides the following benefits;
    * Prevents enemies from targeting ECM protected friendlies outside 200m.
    * Disrupts enemy targeting within 180m with partial / flickering display.
    * Prevents enemy sharing targeting data if enemy is under ECM.
    * Prevents all enemy missile lock acquisition under 180m.
    * Each ECM can counter any other one enemy ECM instead of providing bonuses.
    * Friendly ECM will be negated on an enemy PPC hit for 4 seconds.
    If the ECM carrier is hit
    Another hit will refresh this timer.

* **Command Console** - No current functionality.

* **AMS** - Equipped AMS will provide the following benefits;
    * AMS range is 200m.
    * AMS will prioritise on missiles aimed at you but will actively target enemy missiles passing within 90m.
    * AMS will only function as long as AMS ammo is available.
    * AMS does 2 damage per second
    * Nearly ineffective on SRM's under 90m.

* **C.A.S.E** - CASE when equipped provides the following benefits;
    * CASE will prevent explosion damage from propagating to adjacent sections of your Mech.
    * CASE is only used after all other Hitpoints in that section have been destroyed. Therefore it does not prevent item or component destruction. 
    * For this reason
    * CASE itself has zero HP when determining item destruction and is therefore not a target itself for Critical hits.
    * Explosion damage prevented is from all internal sources such as Gauss and Ammo explosions. 
    * It does not prevent external sources such as splash or direct missile damage.
    * Currently

* **Heat Sinks** - Heat sinks provide two functions. The first is to assist in dissipating the heat generated from weapons

    * Engine Heat Sinks
        * All engines are required to contain a minimum of 10 Heat Sinks to function. 
        * Engines below rating 250 are too small to contain all 10 Heat Sinks inside the engine
        * The first 10 equipped of either type
        * A valid load out of 10 SHS starts with a base of 40 heat capacity
        * A valid load out of 10 DHS starts with a base of 50 heat capacity

    * Single Heat Sinks (in addition to the 10 Engine Heat Sinks)
        * Reduce heat at a rate of .1 per second
        * Cost 1T and 1 critical slot
        * Increase heat capacity by 1 point per Heat sink
    * Double Heat Sinks (in addition to the 10 Engine Heat Sinks)
        * Reduce heat at a rate of .14 per second
        * Cost 1T and 3 critical slots
        * Increase heat capacity by 1.4 points per Heat Sink

-----

So that's what I've got so far

**Change Log:** Updated Artemis to reflect NARC overwrite. Added C-Bill and XP rewards for most items. Changed format slightly to make rewards more obvious (swapped Italic to Bold

**Still required:** Clarification on how Kills are computed. If you damage and kill an enemy, values for Capture / Capture Assists. Also,  confirmation on maximum stacking values of TAG / NARC  / Artemis. Patch notes say 75%, however this can't be right as some systems provide this alone, even without stacking.

I was looking at the size and weight of 'Mechs and decided to do some calculations.  I thought the following was funny.

&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I think the current armor system is fine and I am not suggesting radical tweaks to it. I'm just a numbers guy and found the following pretty entertaining:
&gt;
&gt;Something a lot of people don't realize is that when you double the edge length of a 3D cube, eight times larger. There were a couple threads about this topic, but I didn't see any numbers. I wanted to apply this concept to the Atlas and Commando to see what this did to the 'Mech's armor thickness.
&gt;
&gt;Let's start with a human being
&gt;
&gt;H = 1.74m
&gt;W= 79kg
&gt;
&gt;There are formulae out there for calculating volume and surface area of humans. These formulae should also apply to the Atlas and Commando since they have the same approximate shape. I applied them and got the following:
&gt;
&gt;V = 75.2L
&gt;SA = 1.94m^2
&gt;Density = 1.05kg/L (approximately as dense as water)
&gt;
&gt;So we have a baseline. 'Mechs, since they have a similar form of locomotion. Unlike tank treads, which spread out the weight of a tank, 'Mechs and humans apply all of their weight to a small area beneath their feet. If they were significantly more dense than humans they'd sink into soft ground much too easily to be effective war machines.
&gt;
&gt;The Atlas:
&gt;
&gt;W = 100 short tons ≈ 90700kg.
&gt;H ≈ 16m (from the sources I could find)
&gt;Therefore:
&gt;V ≈ 92000L
&gt;SA ≈ 193m^2
&gt;Density ≈ .98kg/L
&gt;
&gt;So the density is right on! An Atlas really is what you would get if you scaled a human up to 16m tall!
&gt;
&gt;So the Commando:
&gt;
&gt;W = 25 short tons ≈ 22700kg
&gt;H = 9m (official number)
&gt;V ≈ 23000L
&gt;SA ≈ 71m^2
&gt;Density ≈ .99kg/L
&gt;
&gt;Again, fusion reactor, and Streak SRMs.
&gt;
&gt;But hold on, you need more armor to cover it, right? If you keep the same amount of armor and spread it out over more surface area, it gets thinner and easier to penetrate. Let's see if an Atlas really is that much tougher than a Commando.
&gt;
&gt;From looking at the game
&gt;
&gt;So the Commando has 70.85kg of Armor per square meter.
&gt;The Atlas has 89.14kg of Armor per square meter.
&gt;
&gt;So even though it has 244% more armor by weight
&gt;
&gt;tl;dr Not much of the physics in this game make sense

This currently as a sticky by Bryan Eckman in the Beta forums:  
http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/63434-dhs-were-looking-into-it/
&gt;You will hear back from us tomorrow. Everyone take a deep breath. 


A lot of people are doing great work in analysis of it.  
This post in particular intrigues me:  
http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/63408-we-have-derived-why-heat-sinks-are-not-working-as-ostensibly-intended/

&gt;After doing a lot of math and experimentation in the MechLab a team of friends and I have determined that heat sink efficiency degrades with a power law of SQRT[1/(16*x)] where x is the number of heat sinks. This is a very exact equation—meaning it must be completely intentional—that tests perfectly in practice. It means that each successive heat sinks adds less cooling power than the one before it.  

&gt;Because we figured out this relationship we realized that doubling the cooling power available increases heat bleed by 41.4% (or multiplying the cooling power by SQRT[2]). Therefore, we are missing out on almost 60% of the expected cooling power.  

&gt;Furthermore, if you are using doubles) offers less than a 2.5% benefit to cooling. The diminishing returns mean that boating heat sinks is effectively useless.  

&gt;We imagine this implementation was derived in order to mitigate the effects of laserboats (which also tend to be heat sink boats). However, very expensive) part of the game: Generalized heat efficiency. It is nearly impossible to manage a 'Mech's expected heat capabilities when the cooling system is so unintuitive.  

&gt;It is our vehement suggestion that this system be thoroughly reexamined and revamped to more closely match a more rational heat system in which each additional heat sink is exactly as beneficial as the one before it.  

&gt;Please make sure the devs see this; I have also submitted a support ticket about this. My preliminary spreadsheet is available [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwW5mNHnakM8cFFOWVFOMzdqaUk/edit). I will expand the spreadsheet (and add labels and such) as well as elaborate on these hard data tomorrow as I really need to get to sleep.

It's bad when you need to make quick reactions for short cursor distance as the faster you move

ie. You need to move half an inch really fast

You will get used to it pretty fast if you have not changed your settings yet.


You need stability. The ratio from your hand movement to you cursor movement must always be the same regardless of the speed you move your hand. Well that's if you want consistent accuracy. Enhanced precision basically makes it so the faster you move

Test it. With it on move your mouse 3 inches on the desk quickly then slowly. The distances traveled between the two will be different. With precision off it wlll remain the same distance no matter the speed the mouse is moved.

A: If you are referring to Normal and Hardcore descriptors for the matchmaking buckets, players will find it not as powerful as feared or as intrusive into the existing experience, rather accept it as an extension.

A: It&amp;#8217;s a feature you can expect to see once UI 2.0 is out.

 

Strum Wealh: What are the plans and attitudes of PGI with regard to the in-game availability (or lack thereof) of certain BattleMechs (or individual variants thereof) that, and neither it nor the Annihilator not being available outside of the Wolf's Dragoons)?

A: You will however see some of this come into player through price adjustments based on faction availability in a future game update.

 

Gallowglas: I know this is getting WAY ahead of things, you guys manage to get all the mechs into the game, would you consider adding your own designs to the existing canon? Are you allowed to do that with your license agreement? Would that be heresy? I know there's a certain group which would want to stone me for even suggesting this, but let's face it...a LOT of the designs beyond the Unseen were pretty hideous.

Update

Greetings MechWarriors!

And… we’re back!  We hope everyone had a safe and fun holiday season full of BattleMech Combat. The content of this patch was work that was started shortly before the holiday break and there was a focus on getting some quality fixes and improvements. We wanted to start the New Year on the right - giant metallic stomping - foot so to speak!

Included in the patch are movement fixes, because everybody loves NARC right? There are more fixes in there as well so read on.

Most importantly we want you guys to know how excited we are.  We have been plotting out this year’s content and feature schedule and it’s going to be a big year.  Stick with us and you will be able to say “I remember when…”.   So strap in

3050 is the year of MechWarrior Online.

 - Matt Newman


Conquest:

    - Changed it so you now get a resource every 1.7 seconds instead of 2 seconds.
    - Increased the reward for collected resources from 25 per resource to 50 per resource.

Performance:

    - More FPS improvements
      We have seen an increase in performance for the majority for all specs
      users that may notice a performance drop.  As always we are continuing to investigate and improve on the 
     performance for all specs.

Gameplay:

    - XP and C-Bills Rewards for using TAG and NARC 
      This reward is given to pilots that are TAG/NARC'ing a hostile and that hostile takes damage from other 
     friendlies. Given once per hostile mech per match.  

Movement:

    - Reduced/improved snapping when jump jetting
    - Reduced/improved movement snapping in general
    - You should no longer need to fire ahead of where a mech powers down or shuts down in order to hit them
~~- Partial 'lag shield' fix - it is now only affected by your ping
~~NOTE: The ""lag shield"" problem is an acknowledged bug
~~is in progress~~

Lag shield change removed from patch notes: [Bryan explains changes aren't in this release](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/89599-glaring-removal-of-key-patch-notes/page__view__findpost__p__1712725)

Faction Icon

     - Changing your faction icon in on the MWO forums will update your faction icon in the game interface.

Numerous Front End bug fixes.

Various In Game bug fixes.

    - Bullets will no longer pass through things and explode twice
    - Cockpit light will no longer flicker at the lowest setting at low fps (&lt;20)
    - Weapon Bay Door lights are back.
	
We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

The MechWarrior® Online™ Team

I understand that the mechanism to end a game aside from chasing a lone spider around the map while piloting an Atlas needs to exist

Here are my initial ideas: 

* Make a destructible base that has a major consequence for the battlemechs on the field. It could be the LZ for the dropship that they need to get offworld

* Have the mechs ""capping"" actually be performing some function like hacking the station's computers. Maybe when you ""cap"" the base, but they would make for a nice tactical advantage and give capping a true purpose aside from ending the match quickly. 

These ideas are admittedly lacking in some respects because it is 2 AM

* What are other possible means that have not been discussed in depth (so no reticule bloom unless it's a new and novel idea) to prevent massive pinpoint damage?

Then the remaining 2 mechs, then alerting my team that we were being flanked by 2 more mechs.

What do I get when the match is over?  300xp for win

No spotting bonuses

There has got to be a way to credit players who focus mostly on strategic placement/locating/scouting than damage/kills.

I thought spotting bonuses were supposed to help some

1371749092.0,1gqlhb,[Battle Log] Just had the most-fun match I've had so far...,IceAuroch,27,5,22,"So, this Spider is pretty lightly armed, and I'm dodging multiple LLs

I hide behind a ridge for a few moments, a Cataphract-4X sees me and starts making for the base as well. I get there first and cap a few percent, and then we're in each others faces in the tight space of the northwestern base. I think he was a relatively new player, I don't think he even saw me after that, as I was able to stay behind him for the entire brawl - towards the end, he tries to run back to the main fight to get some assistance, and I take him down.

Back to the base, a Stalker-5S and an Atlas-D-DC. I engage them for a few short blasts, they are pretty coordinated, and I figure I've tied up two assaults for a few minutes at the base, so I run to the main battle and join in - it's mostly over, our guys were getting wiped up, and by the time I get there, an one-armed Atlas - don't remember which one. I try to draw a few shots and get in the line of fire to soak up some damage

Now, Atlas coming out to meet us - I don't know if I made the right decision here, but I ran to the base, and tried to get a bit more capping in, while drawing fire from the Stalker. I end up playing ring-around the posy around the base/derrick thing with him, trying to stay behind him as much as I can. He starts to try and focus on my Atlas buddy, I sit behind him and blast away at his rear torso ... moments pass, and the match is all on me (adrenaline engaged!) I circle the stalker one more time, there wouldn't be enough to fuel an ant's motorcycle to go around the inside of a cheerio). 

He is a yellow-armor-only Atlas, I'm taking damage, I see if I can draw him off, I go and hide for a moment. No dice, he sits on his base. Two minutes left now. I run back in, I'm circling him, jumping as much as I can, whatever I can do to bring down the behemoth. He has no back armor left, and everything is yellow. The only armor I have left is on my RCT. So, hit him full in the RCT - and land in some water-tower looking thing and become immediately stuck! FFFFUUUUU! I'm trying to get out frantically

Teamates are crying in chat

According to the recent Dev Answer post they are still on track for creating a set of seperate EU servers and making you make a one off decision as to which one you will play on. The EU server farm and the NA server farm will be isolated from each other and we will no longer be able to play with each other casually

It will have a massive strain on any unit and is the biggest threat to any units survival especially when you consider the move to 12 man matches. I had it in the back of my head I would maintain a second account but it's just not feasable and I also cannot commit to CW / tornie matchers based on NA time's from over in the UK. I can't believe they are doing it tbh it's a stupid idea.

Forget OP ECM

I want to see them go back to the drawing board and wait until they can feasably deliver a cross continent game

I'm a harrier. A skirmisher.  A scout.  My job in an assault mode match boils down to three things.

1. Find the enemy

2. Hit their home base and try to pull some of their mechs out of the fight

3. Fly through the enemy team at break neck speeds, and give my team a chance to fire.

But here's the deal: The XP I get for spotting bonuses and assists on kill is paltry.

In a match where I get 8 assists

Conversely

Lights are penalized XP *for doing their job instead of trying to get killing blows* and it nerfs their XP gain.


XP gain either needs to be weighted to role (Like a Light Mech getting MORE xp per assist


Edit:

I just wanted to add that one XP bonus we *really* need to see in game is:  Getting points in for halting the enemy capturing  your base or node.  It should have a cap so it cannot be abused in matches...but to that little mech that launches himself at 4 mechs standing in his home base--delaying the count down so his teammates can get back and hopefully pull out a victory.

I think my favorite by far has to be the 4H with 3ML and an AC20.  It's not as fast as the other two

After I'm done the HBK I'm trying to think of what to go with Next. Ironically I've been tempted towards a Victor since I've already got a massive XL from my AWS-9M,False,self,t5_2t1w0,False,,,t3_1itlj4

&gt; Updated [rules list] to include giving coordinates for AFK players as falling under Team Treason

&gt; Team Treason

&gt; Treasonous provision of information to enemy combatants

Does that seem a bit heavy-handed? In the over 3, namely giving the enemy information on a still-living teammate that was still playing. Yet there have been dozens of times where it's been helpful for the enemy team to provide the grid where their last teammate is AFK but didn't have the courtesy to disconnect or is hiding like a pussy to try to avoid a death stat, wasting everyone's time instead of playing the match.

Everyone hates that on both sides of the match

Any idea why they would add a common courtesy practice to the policy's forbidden list? They are specifically adding giving coordinates for AFK players to the existing griefing policy which already covered the actual problem scenarios,False,self,t5_2t1w0,1372705559.0,,,t3_1hfaa5
1372365777.0,1h7bip,"Why ""True Team DeathMatch"" would probably suck",mishagale,28,6,61,"I've often heard people clamouring for ""True"" TDM, but here's the thing: The game would be worse without the possibility of capture wins.

Most games that have TDM modes also have respawns. Games which don't have respawns generally have some other victory condition besides ""kill everyone."" This is because trying to kill someone is risky - they'll try to kill you right back. If you are playing Quake 3, the enemy team is one point closer to victory, but that's only one point out of dozens or even hundreds.

If you are playing MWO, your game is over until the next round. So, in a mode where the only objective was to eliminate the enemy team, what is your incentive to go out and look for kills? The smart thing to do is to move to the most defensible position on the map, and camp there. Your aim is to maximise the number of kills you get, and minimise your own chance of being killed, which does not favour aggressive or risky play. 

Games which don't have respawns almost always need some objective other than killing the other team to prevent this problem. It's why counterstrike has hostages and bombs (there are server mods which remove these, but since the bases are *not* the most defensible positions, this is usually a suboptimal strategy. So you need to head out towards the enemy base, and they will be heading towards yours, resulting in epic massive-robot-battles in the middle. 

So, killing an Atlas, or any 'mech for that matter, feels like a great accomplishment, striking a real blow for your team. Chances are, that kill cost you dearly in armour, ammo, but you won it

Games with respawns don't normally have a high time-to-kill. Engagements are over in seconds, but it's really all about quantity, not quality. That's why we used to relish the announcer telling us we were **DOMINATING** or had a **MMMMMONSTER KILL**, but barely noticed the individual kill messages scroll past. The equivalent thrill in MWO is killing an enemy 'mech, watching it explode and collapse in a smoking heap (but we could really do with a word from Betty to go with it...)",,False,t5_2t1w0,True

Then I notice someone from the opposite team say ""GG :)"" and hit tab to check the scores. We're 5-2 down. Just me and the Commando I helped out before. 'Bugger! Oh well, I then get a lucky shot (either a head or an internal toro crit on an XL) and take the other mech down.

_____


Each time the internal structure of a Mech takes damage, and a 3% chance of causing 3 critical hits (for a total of a 42% chance of any sort of critical hit). Each critical hit will randomly hit a weapon or piece of equipment in that location; the chance of a particular piece of equipment being hit is proportional to how many critical slots it occupies. Each critical hit damages the weapon/equipment an amount equal to the damage that caused the critical hit.

For example

Currently, is lowering the health of the Gauss rifle to 3 points. And, sometime soon, we plan on doing a full pass on the health of all the items.

Critical damage to the side torso hit boxes of XL engines deals damage to the engine as a whole. However, critical damage to your engine will not disable it, but simply add to your repair bill. This is likely to change when we do the pass on the health values.

1374770889.0,1j1cac,Mwo Escort game mode,saux01,33,14,34," I would like to see more game modes added. One in particular that I have been thinking about a lot would be an escort mission in which you would need to protect or assault a cargo train/convoy (optional win might be to destroy the other side's mechs) . Imagine a large with terrain that would help conceal/provide cover along the path. The convoy would take a certain amount of time (example: 7 min) to reach its destination which would be a win for the escorting team and the sides are switched. Destroying the convoy before the time limit is reached
 This might encourage more medium or fast heavy mech being played (these types are less frequently used then say assaults or lights it seems) as you would need to keep up with it and still have fire power to destroy or defend it. Scouting would still be important since there could be more than one path that the convoy could take either randomly or somehow a selected option from the escorting team. Scouts could fan out
 
 I think this would be a nice change of pace from the usual standoffs or cheesy base capping that most of the time just leaves one or both teams angry. This idea is probably out there on the forums somewhere but I am at work on a slow day and can't read them... ftl

I fully support any build you want to create but a key tenet of MW has always been that there are trade-offs.  PPCs (should) run hot
The rest of this post will not focus on game balance.  I will accept (for the moment) that PPC builds rule the battlefield and

On to my tale:  My friends and I were getting to the point where we didn't want to play the game due to the PPC balance issues.  Losing is one thing, overheat/shutdown, rinse and repeat.  (Props to some of the highly skilled snipers out there - you deserve credit for maximizing the PPC build.)  There seemed to be few counters to a pinpoint accurate 50 point alpha strike.  So we stopped worrying about winning and just started having fun with various builds. In time, we started messing around with lights (again), and we ""discovered"" something rather obvious - mobility rules the battlefield. 
We all started running lights and we developed our own lance tactics that took advantage of our light mech mobility:
- begin to cap a flag on an assault map as a distraction to pull off any defenders
- hunt the other team's lights (obviously), and base cappers
- wolfpack heavies that stray from their group &lt;-- our specialty

All of these tactics are obvious so I don't expect any surprised reactions.  But what really worked was communication (we use vent) when combined with our speed and mobility.  A call of ""isolated Stalker at E5"" would bring us all in a swarm.  Easy prey when they have no streaks

But the best part of all this is that we began winning, rather than a threat, since we can zig-zag faster than they can aim - besides, they're usually target fixated on the PPC sniper from the other team.  When we find them hiding behind a hill (usually alone in the backfield, in their sniper positions) we nibble at their ankles until they die a 'death from a thousand cuts.'

So that's my story.  The tactics we developed aren't terribly original but they work for us against the current flavor of the month. And when that flavor changes, decide when and where to engage, and we kill your PPC cheese builds!

How it works: We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death. Stats are recorded.

Over 90% of the time we match up

So basically leave it up to the Hosts to manage the matches and rankings and you get to provide the carnage.

- Seismic sensor: Flanking has always been part of victory tactics and getting surprised from behind was your own stupidity. Now

- PPCs: Ah, LRMpocalypses, Boomcat. But unlike PPCs/ERPPCs these things had weakness: Range. You could keep your distance to boomcats and srm cats and you could sneak up on LRM boats and hug them.
Now PPC boating is a whole new story. Sure
Best suggestion I've read so far is that slower the projectile speed a bit and change the PPC damage to 6+4 meaning that 6 damage will be delivered directly where the ppc hits and rest 4 damage is spread to adjacent components.

- Useless weapons: Ah, SPLaser, Narc. I do understand that flamers and MGs were mainly anti infantry weapons but MWO does not have infantry so why not make the viable againts mechs? Machine gun is even more waste of tonnage for small mech than small pulse is weighing at least 1,5 tons. Sure, the crit seeking could be nice feature except there's nothing useful to crit! And once the armor is gone there's really no point in seeking to destroy those components because the internals will be gone soon anyways.
Flamers have been made a bit more viable but I think they could do a little damage aswell.
Now NARC
For small pulse there aint much more to say than just tweak the numbers. It doesn't really work as alternative to medium lasers nor does it perform better than small lasers.

So

TL;DR: I really hope that PGI achieves balance one day because I love playing MWO.

&gt;As I’ve mentioned in other posts MWO does not have a cheap HUD it contains a lot of detail and we always planned to have Scaleform 4.0 as part of the CryEngine 3.4 update which is much more optimal than the version currently in MWO. Sadly this integration did not come as part of the 3.4 update

&gt;Levels

&gt;The levels were created with performance in mind but not as the primary goal and visual quality was more important to us initially. Each level is now getting a cleanup pass and the changes will roll out in upcoming patches all of them should be done by early in the New Year. This work has already been making its way to production Forest Colony and Frozen City are already done and other maps are coming down the pipe

&gt;Terrain

&gt;We’ve been looking more closely at the Terrain code in 3.4 and noticing that it is generally responsible for much of the streaming/hitching happening in game. We are working to tune it for min spec machines; this work should help all platforms feel generally ‘smoother’ in terms of performance. There were also a few regressions caused by a cleanup pass that happened a few weeks ago which have been caught and re-exported correctly that go out on production today.

&gt;Ray Traces

&gt;Mechs sure can fire a lot of lasers and also use ray traces for range finding

&gt;Audio

&gt;We’ve also recently done some audio cleanup passes that should help performance that go out in today’s patch.

&gt;Engine

&gt;CryEngine 3.4 was a great update for us and lays the groundwork for many good things to come


&gt;We’ve also significantly tightened up on our process for internal performance testing of upcoming builds to ensure builds don’t go out with any significant performance regressions. We appreciate that there are some outstanding performance issues awaiting fixes on production 4fps bug and degradation over time

&gt;Starting today we hope you will experience some improvement in today’s build with a much more significant improvement in the following build that we hope will bring us much more in line with where performance was earlier in closed beta and then only ever the same or better from there.


&gt;As always we thank you for your support and patience and hope to see you on the Battlefield. ",self,t5_2t1w0,False,,EXP,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/149ymi/matthew_craig_dev_comments_on_performance/

I was thinking about the problem, I would think would be pretty easy to code is, as the system is already in place.

Since Mechwarrior is true to life to 'Mechs as one can be without they really existing yet (well not yet at least :P), and the heatsinks aren't going from a ""cold-turkey' state to high heat instantly.

However

To keep within the MWO universe, the pilot, are faced with the decision of a short term strong punch, vs a potentially long term damage to yourself, and making you less viable for the match. 

Additionally, the slimmer the chance that your high alpha will blow out a heat sink. Or, they can say the more heat sinks you have, the higher the threshold your mech has before the game determines if a heatsink should be lost.

Heatsink destruction is already in the game, they would not have to code a whole engine to fix a problem, people can still do high alphas if they want but with some downsides.

1. Less Ammo. Most weapons will be fine with 2 Tons.  
2. Less back armor. In most divisions you will be better off with more front armor since you are only fighting one enemy.  
3. If possible optimize your DPS for 30-45 seconds without overheating.  

**Dueling**  
1. Torso Twist. Spread that damage.  
2. Never Overheat. This will get you killed... quick.  
3. Clear any preconceived notions of ""good"" v.s. ""Bad"" mechs. Some ""useless"" chassis excel at dueling.

How it works: 

We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death.  

Stats are recorded.  

Over 90% of the time we match up
One of the funniest ""missed-sync"" drops was all trial spiders! (we went 4-8)  

So basically we leave it up to the Hosts to manage and you to provide the carnage.

PS: We also try to record all matches and post them on our youtube channel.

On the ""hidden goodies"" side, why stop there, why not see what else is lurking around in the game files?  I found a _LOT_ of interesting graphics and UI work in there, some hilariously outdated, though some of these are clearly early prototypes.  Here are some highlights:

I played the shit out of the original Mechwarrior on PC back on my dad's 286. When I first heard that someone was making a new MW game I was sold instantly.

First, the tactics feel good.  All of this should be the base of a great game.

Here's where I get confused.  It feels like there is a severe disconnect between the devs and those who really enjoy the core game and want to see it made great.  What it comes down to is a lack of dialogue and an opaqueness and generally patronizing attitude coming from the devs.  It's like they won't acknowledge the community that is smart and *wants to help them*.

Some examples:

First that comes to mind is the lack of complete patch notes.  I cannot fathom the reasoning behind not including major changes to the patch notes of a game that the devs keep reiterating is IN BETA.  When changes are made to the game and you want people to test them out

Then there's the ""ask the devs"" and other sources of info which are ridiculously patronizing.  There is never any serious discussion of plans, PPCs, etc. are all brushed aside.  There was little to no discussion about the matchmaking issues until the devs decided to lay out their 3 phased matchmaking plan (which is still not fully fleshed out) without any consultation whatsoever. 

Take the problems they had with double heat sinks and the incorrect heat values for pulse lasers.  These are issues that were discovered by members of the beta testing group who noticed that what they were being told about the mechanics were not lining up with their experience.  They then did some pretty rigorous testing and found the problems.  It's obvious that the devs read this and realized that they were right.  But instead of acknowledging their work, they just pretended as though it was a bug that they found internally and then fixed (a fix that was flawed).  

Another obvious one is the move to open beta.  Instead of talking to the community and having a reasonable discussion with the people that are the most intimately familiar with the game as it exists about some ideas for moving to open beta, forever losing a portion of potential players for whom the game was far too newb-unfriendly. 

The latest thing that's got me is this move to 3rd person.  So this gets announced in an unclear way on some quasi-sponsored podcast where the hosts just acquiesce and don't ask any meaningful questions.  Understandably the community erupts because first of all this was never supposed to be in the game (by the dev's own plans), *THEN*, the devs setup a feedback [thread](http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/73172-the-official-3rd-person-view-feedback-thread/).  Why didn't they just ask for feedback before this announcement?  Anybody could have told you that this would be howled at.  This strategy (and it is a strategy as evidenced by its continuous pattern) creates a terrible relationship between the devs, who obviously need help from the community, and that same community who see themselves constantly ignored, blown off, or treated as idiotic entitled whiners.

I just don't understand what's going on.  On one hand the devs do seem committed to communication, every spontaneous new announcement, every back-pedal, every show of incompetence that gets followed up with PR bullshit instead of honest talk... it makes me wonder.

**TL;DR:**  PGI has been patronizing to their testers and fans for a while now and it seems like a poor strategy.
 
**Edit:**  Part of the problem /r/mwo is that anybody who is critical of the management of this game gets downvoted to hell.  Even if it's a realistic and non-vitriolic critique.  Why can't we have a discussion instead of people getting into camps of either ""the devs are retarded"" or ""devs are awesome

Open Beta - Update #1 - Patch 1.0.142

Upcoming Patch - Tuesday Nov. 6th @ 10AM – 1PM PDT


Change Log
________________________________________
Update


Hello Folks
It’s been another big push for content and gameplay this patch. There are several new things for you to take a look at and test out. In summary, a new piece of information warfare equipment and some tuning to existing systems. Also included with this patch is the first phase of the Match Maker system.
Forest Colony Snow is a new take on the original Forest Colony. There have been a few changes to some of the gameplay spaces which change the tide and tactics of how battles on this map will play out.
The Centurion CN9-D has been added to round out the Centurion family.
The Artemis IV FCS Upgrade system has been added to the game. Artemis IV is an enhanced targeting system that increases the accuracy of LRMs and SRMs. This means that more missiles will be hitting on target than previous. This does not mean that SRMs become guided
A very big improvement in Mech hit-box detection was also included in this patch. You should notice much greater accuracy in weapon hit detection than previously.
While not 100% eliminated
That being said


**GENERAL**

MATCHMAKING Phase 1

This patch

This is phase 1 of a 3 phase Match Making upgrade and will eventually evolve into a skill based matching system.


Match Making – Phase 1

Players can launch into a match as a solo player.

Players can launch into a match as a group.

Player groups cannot be larger than 4 players.

Player groups can be 2

The Match Maker still checks to make sure there are even Mech weight classes on both teams.

Example: A player group of 4 players launches. The match maker then tries to find more players to fill an 8 player team. The additional players can be another group of 4


**New BattleMech:**

Centurion CN9-D

Tonnage: 50

Top Speed: 97.2 kph

Armor: 8.5 tons

Weapons: 2 Medium Lasers

Hardpoints: 2 Energy, 1 AMS


**Artemis IV FCS Upgrade**

Artemis improves the grouping size of LRM and SRM volleys.

Artemis improves the lock on time and tracking strength of LRMs

Artemis does NOT add guidance to SRMs.

Upgrade panel has an Artemis category with two options – Artemis and Remove Artemis

The Artemis category will not show up if the ‘Mech does not have Missile hardpoints.

Changing options will automatically upgrade/downgrade any existing eligible missile weapons and swap any eligible missile ammo to the proper type

The Artemis upgrade can be applied to all standard LRM and SRM launchers

Price of the upgrade includes cost of the upgrade itself plus cost of the ammo if there was not enough in the inventory

Ability to select the Artemis upgrade will depend on availability of sufficient slots and tonnage

When viewed in “Loadout”

For any weapons that are Artemis eligible

Similarly


**GAMEPLAY**

Double heat sinks are now 1.4 times as effective as standard heat sinks. This includes DHS's that you place on your Mech as well as those integrated into the engine.

Trial Mechs now get locked when taken into gameplay.

If you leave early

Mechs with Weapon Bay Doors can toggle the doors open/closed with ‘/’ slash

Catapult and Centurion now have weapon bay door indicator lights in the cockpit. Green for Open

Fixed a source of de-synchronization issues (result should be better hit-box detection)

**WEAPONS**

AC/20 heat reduced from 7 to 6

Small Pulse Lasers were only generating 50% of the amount of heat they should have been. This is now fixed.

Small Lasers


**MAPS**

Forest Colony

There is now a beached ship splitting the large water expanse. This provides a new area of cover for people engaging long-range enemies.

NEW: Forest Colony Snow

Forest Colony Snow is now part of the random map rotation. During the winter, frozen ground, with an icy chill in the air.


**BUG FIXES**

Heat value will no longer desync for clients when a Mech does not contain any external heat sinks
The Catapult K2 now has correct geometry/textures when swapping out PPCs.

New equipment on Mechs will default to weapon group 1 instead of not being set
Missiles will now correctly explode at their max range

Locking animation will no longer play when firing SRM if LRM/SSRM ran out of ammo
Machine gun will no longer fire when Mech has been destroyed

Catapult arms will once again blow off correctly when side torso has been destroyed
Greatly reduced Mech ragdoll jittering

Fix an issue where the cockpit and/or arms will randomly jitter

LRM’s will no longer behave incorrectly (spin wildly) when fired at corners of objects at close range
Ammo counter will update with each volley fired

Damage glow amount and size reduced


We thank you for your patience and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!

Since I had so much fun with my [speed optimization calculations last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1hq63g/the_math_behind_optimal_speed_of_your_mech_or_why/)

I've found a way to mathematically express another one of the big problems we continually debate...and here's the part that will really get the physics/math types out there wet:  I figured out how to map that problem onto another type of problem that was already solved around a hundred years ago.  This means that all the hard work has already been done by people who are long dead (so we get their share of the credit :-) ).

Now, and there's a big parameter space out there, so I would like to get a working group of similarly minded people together to solve this stuff and put it out there.  Nor do I know the actual answer is going to be.  That's the most exciting part.

How it works:

We have hosts that get everyone distributed into teams (so you can call a grudge match if desired). Then our hosts drop both teams at the same time in conquest mode. The hosts summarize the Arena Rules and then each sends a mech (or 2) out to the designated arena territory to fight to the death.

So basically we leave it up to the Hosts to manage and you to provide the carnage.

Currently there is a slight penalty for overheating

My proposal is to implement a more punishing heat system. You can have a threshold of 100% for the automatic shutdown but heat is still tracked and accrued above this point. A threshold of 105% would serve as a point where you take damage EVEN IF you have shutdown. 

This would make overheating at all a very dangerous proposition without having to enter into the messy business of tweaking weapon stats and altering convergence values. ",self,t5_2t1w0,False,,CR2,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1cy1e9/my_suggestion_to_fix_the_meta_dont_nerf_weapons/

After bobbing and weaving through the upper city streets and harassing their assaults and heavies

Unfortunately, and destroyed piecemeal on its retreat back down the hill towards our base, but not after managing to destroy all remaining heavies.  The successful party scraped by with a Centurion at about 70%, an Atlas at 46% with minimal center torso armor and no right arm as well as a stalker at 62% which was banged up in all armor slots.

Meanwhile, we hightailed it to the enemy base to attempt a Cap (pick your battles...) at their dropship base.  Cicadabro was at about 65%, with myself sustaining heavy damage to the right leg and left torso and completely out of Streak SRMs.  A well placed shot on either of those by the armament the remaining enemy mechs had at their disposal would leave me dead or immobilized.  After getting the cap bar down to about 1/3, Mr. Centurion arrived to stall the cap.  And he served that purpose admirably, holding us off long enough to allow the Atlas/Stalker to arrive before succumbing to our en masse medium laser strafing.  Not 5 seconds after dispatching the Cent, the one armed Atlas lumbers up the front slope with the Stalker close behind.

While the Atlas was weak, beacause that Stalker was still out there, and I didnt want to be caught standing still behind the Atlas. The slightly slower Cicadabro opted for a ""shooting gallery"" approach, with a wide arc around the obstructions to minimize running into something.  Meanwhile, the Stalker lumbered up and around the battle on the pad, all the while chain firing his weaponry of ER PPC's at the quick mechs that were assaulting his lancemate.  His objective, which only became apparent later

The Atlas succumbed on the pad to the combined firepower of our medium lasers, he ducked into the structures around the pad and ran around towards the dropship, hoping the Stalker would lose interest in favor of my Raven-3L currently lazing him in the back.  However, his interest was not dissuaded as the Stalker continued turning his torso around to obtain a clear line of sight to the dropship.  As Cicadabro rounded the Dropship, at least 3 ER PPC's caught him square in the cockpit.

Cicadabro was down.  No ejection pod.

I made a couple more passes around the Stalker with my 3 Medium lasers, and the single ER PPC at close range that stripped my right leg armor alerted me to that fact.  I ducked and weaved away through the structures around their cap and retreated down the front slope that the Assault mechs had originally come from.  

This was now a cat and mouse game.  My speed and maneuverability vs. his sheer firepower and durability. He could kill me with one shot...if he could catch me.

Circling around to the left, who was still watching his territory like a hawk. His return fire was swift, but not quite swift enough, as I was able to back off around the corner *just* as an ER PPC splashed home on the corner where I was standing moments before.  At this point I ran through the tunnel to the other side, and drove out to be greeted by an alpha strike that hit the wall of the tunnel from his perch, he had missed, but only by a hair.  I retreated out and to the left and back down the front slope to reassess my situation.

I was getting careless. Of course I would go under the tunnel

I could hear the echoes of my slain lancemates (text chat...) as they gave me encouragement to continue my fight and I formulated a plan.  I put the ECM in the 'Counter' configuration and lined up to assault from the left side again, and presumably his sensors had just picked me up as an approaching target.  I switched back over to disrupt mode on my ECM package while firing, as he sped up his traverse to meet me.  I dodged right just as an ER PPC hit the ground to my left, presumably at the limit of his torso twist, he was now rotating his mech around to obtain a target picture.  I continued up and around behind him, all the while firing medium lasers at every opportunity.  I initiated my circle strafing as I went around behind him, favoring full speed and knowing full well that on this uneven surface, I was damaging my BattleMech's already damaged legs.  I repeated this circle at least 3 times, but not enough to shoot me

I fired.

Enemy Destroyed.

Well, and as a result I came to some perhaps incorrect conclusions. I have since altered the sheet.

[updated file here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B69AQHLDMJo6Y19ZQUpEZDVZV28/edit?usp=sharing)

Some info before we get started

**Assumptions**

* Speed and free tonnage are valued equally  
* Speed tweak has not been applied  
* Maximum armor will be used

**Methodology**

Frame weight is calculated as ten percent of max tonnage

Weight of each engine rating is defined with a minimum of ten sinks

Max armor for each chassis is added to frame weight plus engine weight

Free tonnage is then modified by endo steel weight reductions if applicable.

Speed is calculated as (Engine/Tonnage) x 16.2

Final free weight is multiplied by speed to give a Battle Value. The maximum BV is then reported as well as the engine size that offers maximum battle value. This is further summarized by inclusion of free tonnage at max armor

The sixth sheet and onward contains a graph for the BV for each chassis. Should be a lot easier to read but it doesn't have max values in it

The summary for each engine type and skeleton material is on the first four tabs in lines 24-42 for each chassis or variant with different engine specs.

**Conclusions**

Many of the engine recommendations are different from the previous sheet as every Mech is as fully armored so as to leave no tonnage unused. I haven't done any what-if analysis to see what happens when you strip percentages of tonnage. That will be even more heavy processing and I don't know if it's something that would be useful. **In my opinion, but with max armor a smaller engine was required for optimum balance of speed and potential power.

If you want to see the effect armor has, so you can choose how best to optimize for speed, firepower and durability.

Of note are the zero and negative BV. At zero BV, but the weight exceeds free tonnage. Worst offenders are the Centurion D and the Cicada.

FF armor is an absolute pain to calculate out

If, let me know what I did wrong and I will amend it. I can also look at stuff that you want me to look at, getting my stats chops back in shape.

**Late edit** Doing more calculations and it's looking like XL+Endo always wins, both because of how large the side torso profile is. 

Run an Atlas with an XL and Endo and you really neuter available slots

I was wondering what the community's opinion on friendly fire penalties is. Right now I think it is kind of screwy. I notice in pugs people don't mind taking risky shots right through me if I have enough armor not to be killed. It many games I take way more friendly fire damage then enemy damage. Meanwhile

Another task that I find time consuming is taking a mech configured in the game and recreating it in the Online lab to try various tweaks. Here

I would contend that providing API access would allow us to easily take a tool such as Smurfy's online mech lab, import, export, edit, or remove a Mech from our mechbay. This would also allow the developer community to develop Android, iOS, etc. apps for managing our inventory. It reduces the steps required for planning and purchasing mechs.

Open Beta Update #5

Upcoming Patch - Tuesday Dec. 4th @ 10AM – 1PM PDT

UPDATE

Happy Holidays MechWarriors! Open beta update 5 is inbound!

‘Tis the season to Deck your Mech with holiday themed Items! These Items are here for a limited time and are sure to please the misses’. “Look honey I hung the Xmas lights”. For some added tactical options you can also turn your Xmas lights on and off. Oddly enough powering down your BattleMech does not affect the Xmas lights

ECM is here and personally I can’t wait to ruin some streak cats day with this excellent piece of equipment. I am going to be honest with you ECM is a game changer so let us know how you feel about ECM on the forums because lately I think you guys have been holding back and not telling us how you really feel.

The Cataphract Hero Mech “Ilya Muromets” is in this patch with an excellent skin by our man Hayden. What can I say about this Mech? “Ilya?.. More Like Kill ya!” is how our tools programmer Kyle L put it and I have to agree.

I can’t remember but I think you guys wanted 8-player groups too right? Well those are in there too. You choose “8-Player Required” when creating a group. You will require 8-players to launch and your groups will only be matched against other 8-player groups.

Once again I want to remind you we have people 100% focused on performance and networking and we are making headway. The people making these above features are separate group of resources.

Until next patch.

I've had more success in 12s by fitting my TBT-7K with an XL280, there's a good chance with the increased number of players that you'll expose yourself to multiple enemies with PPC's when you do attempt a flank on someone caught out of position.

In MechWarrior: Online, and mobility work in conjunction with the size of the map/terrain.

Examples:

-Firepower has distance related traits. Brawlers aren't a preferred 'Mech for a large map such as Alpine or Tourmaline.

-Mobility obviously has a lot to do with map size. Quicker 'Mechs traverse it at a much faster rate.

-Armor increases survivability. This is actually more related to the lack of necessity to complete the objective opposed to eliminating the enemy team (which brings me to my next point).

The current map rotation changes map sizes, etc which is a UI1.0 problem. There is no pre-game lobby, so there is no organization as to which 'Mech is chosen and why. I believe this (along with only having two game modes) is why we see more assault/heavy 'Mechs on the field. Why?

Let's say we had a pre-game lobby. You see that you're about to drop on Alpine

-A bunch of Assault 'Mechs on the enemy team spreading out to attempt outcapping you is not going to end well. They will be isolated and picked off one by one.

-Lights are faster

These two things (ideally) result in a win. There is no necessity for elimination of the enemy team.

Now let's look at another scenario: You're in the pre-game lobby, and so does your team. Why?

-Close quarters combat on a map where the objective isn't a priority

-Not big and open, it is a different terrain than other maps.

Now this, are what seem to cause the high usage of Assault and Heavy 'Mechs.

Although I understand we are still using UI1.0

**ALSO:** 12v12s will make this concept I have explained even more extreme. Who will care about objectives on River City when there are 12 enemy 'Mechs 1000meters away?

**tl;dr**: Varying map sizes/terrains in rotation change how much of a priority objectives should be. When no one knows which map they are dropping on

=====================

Any thoughts? I feel that this contributes to the current meta and there do need to be more quantitative incentives for completion of objectives such as higher cbills, so maybe these problems will be fixed, but this may be a plausible explanation for the time being.",,False,self,t5_2t1w0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1izspa/the_current_problem_with_objectives_in_mwo/

* Textures popping in and out when you approach objects

* Other graphical fidelity issues

* A general lack of visual fidelity in the maps; they sort of look like they have the level of detail of maps from Counterstrike 1.6...which is fine if it was 2003.

Granted, and there's still A LONG way to go visually.

1370981084.0,1g57ve,Are the rules becoming too complex?,mishagale,28,10,51,"Reading the latest post, and will be hard for new players to follow.

We already have a pretty complicated game, with various special cases and formulae being introduced. I'm referring to things like:

* Heat sinks - DHS are 1.4x as efficient, only the built-in heatsinks.)
* Maximum engine size is 1.4x the stock engine for lights
* The critical hits system
* The various ranges associated with ECM
* Diminishing returns of cadet bonus - your match rewards for your first 50 matches are determined by a *logarithm*?
* Elo (not so much of a problem

It's understandable, and a lot of that complexity is going to be in the numbers. Personally, I don't really have trouble keeping up with these rules (though mwowiki is invaluable), but I've been introduced to them gradually, and I have above-average mathematical education. For a new player, or someone not terribly numerate, is all this a bit too confusing? I don't believe in dumbing-down, adding hardpoint sizes

It may be that these things are really needed to maintain balance and still allow player freedom, I am just concerned that the combined effect is to make the game's rules as clear as mud.

Here are mine:

* Add an MC purchase option alternative for expensive gear like Engines
* Remake the Champion (10% XP boost) concept as an MC-only purchasable module (instead of adding fake variants of mechs that many players will simply never buy)
* Additional colors (e.g., bronze, copper, etc)
* Additional camos (e.g., Spotted, a better take on Buccaneer (something more pirate-y than throwing a skull-n-bones on what otherwise looks more like a Vagabond scheme should (strips of duct tape placed haphazardly)), Battle Damaged (see the Cent's shield arm; battle scars are not just for hero mechs)
* Hero mechs for certain existing chassis that don't have them yet (for me it'd be the Atlas, Raven, and Hunchback. Maybe the Trebuchet) and additional heroes for the Awesome and Cataphract would likely be insta-purchase.
* Sales are always good. Chassis sales, camo and color sales, and XP conversion sales all tend to work for me. Of course an MC sale would work as well.

&gt;We have to starve out the current matches so you'll likely notice that games are even harder to find for the next 15 minutes while the system cycles but should then be back to the same times as before this patch.

To get it to work

Place the Music folder inside MechWarrior Online/Game.

The best thing is that you can add your own music too!    

Copy the &lt;Pattern Name=""mat....&gt; to a new line within &lt;MainLayer&gt;&lt;/MainLayer&gt;. Ensure that you give it a new 'Name' as this is how it's referred to internally. Finally

You may need to convert them to '.ogg' (use Audacity) as I haven't had much luck with mp3.
