[Lightning Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180617)

Lightning reaver is something I play in my Adun Oakenheart EDH deck on mtgo. Every time I have got in into play (4-5 times) it has really wrecked the other 2-3 players. The haste makes up for such a high mana cost for a 3/3 and the fear also is very useful. The damage is does is pretty insane after two or three turns and it works quite well with multiple attack steps through cards like [seize the day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=30573). 

In multiplayer EDH it definitely seems a ton more powerful

Consistency is one of the hardest thing to attain in an EDH deck. Whether its a teneb

Except for land screw. No one, slow, and filled with regrets. 

It's rather simple to avoid, for every [Paradise Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370448) and [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194975) you play instead of a land you are strangling your deck's ability to compete! A one-shot jump in mana for a single turn does not equal the consistency of a land for every turn. Being able to cast a five drop before your opponent can cast a four drop is not worth a card in EDH. Let's say you live the dream and you drop a [Mirrari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=338455) before you opponents can cast their  [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191064) , [Ogre Battledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370662), and [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247345) . How much do you really benefit? Was that Lotus petal really worth the cost of a card in your deck when the other opponents can just overwhelm any modicum of a lead that has been created? A land drop will be better than a card like Lotus petal in almost every single situation, besides maybe storm, and even in storm i'd rather play an island.

If you are just starting into EDH and find that the mana bases are overwhelming here are some basic guidelines. **Start at 39 lands**. It may seem like much but being able to play your cards is always more fun than watching your friends play the game. For every two mana rocks you add into your deck, It is ok to take out a single land. But never drop below 36 lands, even the edric deck shouldn’t drop below 36 lands and that thing plays 4 different types of llanowar elves.

Also, [Haunted Fengraf]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245289) , and [Kessig Wolfrun]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233256) ? You lose, that’s what. You need colored sources to cast you spells, so please play your basics, it’ll do the deck good.

Overall, the engine is what does all the work.

I'm an avid TCG player- started with Harry Potter and Yu-Gi-Oh, Lord of the Rings, and of course, the mother of all TCGs, Magic!

What brings me here to your screen is an appeal for assistance- I know just what my playstyle is

My favorite way to play is theme/flavor-centric- my all time favorite deck is a Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Magician deck- for those unfamiliar, cheats, and tricks- it's usually considered quite bad, unless you structure around it entirely (which I do).

My current two EDH decks are Rhys the Redeemed (pretty standard stuff) and Gisela

1373254726.0,1hubnp,[META] On improving the quality of /r/EDH.,ShakeAndShimmy,52,14,86,"Ladies and gentlement of /r/EDH

A little about myself, without further ado, I'd like to discuss some of the issues I have noticed with this sub.

**1. What exactly is /r/EDH *for*?**

At first glance, a few alters, and tales of EDH shenanigans.  One could say that that this place is for all things EDH, a concept I support, but what exactly do we offer as a community that somewhere like mtgsalvation doesn't offer?  We do not have lists of community created/reviewed primers, we do not have well organized and defined areas of discussion, we almost never acknowledge 1v1 EDH and we have zero posting guidelines beyond ""basic reddiquette"".  This brings me to another negative facet of this subreddit...

**2. Our lack of posting guidelines and any level of standards is limiting the potential of this subreddit.**

All too often while browsing this subreddit I notice posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hsucx/my_thraximundar_deck_needs_fixing/) or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1hpy2q/looking_for_input_on_my_first_edh_deck/) or one of the hourly ""help me with my Kaalia deck"" posts.  The problem with these posts is that they provide little to no information about what their local meta looks like, etc.) and what their budget is for additional cards.  This severely hampers anyone wishing to provide constructive criticism.  Some kind souls are willing to comment anyways to get the relevant information from the OP, but that really shouldn't be the case in a subreddit that discusses decklists as often as we do.

A quick fix to this problem would be to add and *enforce* some posting rules/guidelines in the sidebar that ban non-self posts to deckhosting websites like Tappedout.net in order to encourage the relevant information to be added in the initial post itself.  While this would ideally improve the quality of the posts on this sub

**3. The comments can be just as low quality as some of the self posts.**

Comments that just say ""look at the sidebar"" do not contribute anything to the discussion that this subreddit is supposed to host.  People come here looking for ideas from a friendly community and it saddens me that some of us feel we have nothing more to offer than links to a completely different EDH forum.  In an ideal world we would have our own series of regularly updated primers submitted by members of our own community for general use and perusal.  Some members in the past have expressed interest in writing primers of their own to submit and I feel many more share that interest.  We should be able to provide that as a community dedicated to EDH.

I have also noticed a significant amount of hostility directed towards a series of deck archetypes like dedicated Combo, and Land Destruction.  The popular opinion is that running cards like Memnarch or Armageddon will lose you friends or be justification for some level of physical violence against your person for running those cards/combos.  In a format that stresses playing what you find most fun above all else I ask you why do we have people discouraging the archetypes listed above or ""hateful"" cards?  Everybody has different definitions of fun and nobody's can be considered superior.  Just because you don't like fast combos doesn't mean there aren't people who DO like them and you shouldn't discourage their use because of your own issues with the archetype.  I personally am a Stax player who plays cards that other people may not enjoy.  That being said, I thoroughly despise watching people ramping into turn 4 Ulamog in monogreen or cards like Possibility Storm.  However, I do not discourage their use simply because I do not enjoy the same things other people enjoy.  I hope as a community we can keep that concept close to heart as we move on in the future.



**In Conclusion...**

Despite the negative things I've noticed within this subreddit I truly do love this subreddit and its community.  There are a lot of great people out there willing to coach an EDH noob through his first deck and provide some real and interesting feedback on a deck concept.  To those people I say thank you

We have a fantastic opportunity here to make this subreddit a haven for EDH enthusiasts worldwide

Are you ever late game needing a board wipe

Cycling lands prevent dead draws late game at the small cost of coming into play tapped if need to use them as mana.

They are also cheap (most of them can be had for ~$1)

Probably the best thing I ever did for my EDH decks was add all of the cycling lands in my general's colors to my decks.

Why do I care, it's the same shit every single time I sit down to play. It's not fun anymore. There is no incentive to play a fair deck, as there is significant financial benefit to playing combo or deadeye.



Several of us in the group have petitioned to have deadeye banned from EDH in the store, but this stifles creativity, fun, and is harmful to the growth of the group.

The following will be my personal analysis of cards in my Karador

---
Artifacts:

Blasting Station - This card is a must have in Karador in my opinion.  You do not want your cards exiled and it gives both a good sacrifice outlet AND a combo piece(if that is your style).  It provides insane value with other cards in deck(Skullclamp

Chromatic Lantern - This is a personal choice of mana rock

Crucible of Worlds - This is a card that rotates in and out of my deck a lot based on whether the meta has LD or not.  I try not to abuse the wasteland/strip mine interaction but if a player is asking to be striped of their lands

Mimic Vat - Usually a must have in almost any graveyard based deck to eek out value.  No exception here and not much to discuss

Sensei's Diving Top - Very underwhelming in Karador compared to many other decks, it is a staple.

Skullclamp - Insane value in a toolbox/utility Karador build.  Equip to a Qasali Pridemage before you blow up someones artifact and you get to draw 2 cards.  Dont need the land from Sakura-Tribe Elder? Draw two cards.  Absolutely necessary in Karador IMO. 

Sol Ring - Zzzz staple

Witchbane Orb - I ran this before I had a leyline

---

Creatures:

Acidic Slime - Trades up

Angel of Despair - There arent too many traditional reanimation fatties that you normally see in a strictly reanimation type deck.  But angel makes the cut easily.  Vindicate with wings

Dawntreader Elk - Ramp on a creature that sacrifices itself.  I run this because of skullclamp

Deathrite Shaman - My meta runs a lot of flashback

Dryad Arbor - Land on a creature

Duplicant - Pesky indestructible cards getting in your way?  Well then I have an answer for that.  This is a staple and not much more needs to be said.

Elesh Norn

Eternal Witness - Clampable

Harmonic Sliver - A great card to deal with anything bothering you

Harvester of Souls - A lot of the creatures in my deck are able to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.  Feeding your draws and allowing you to reach a critical mass where you cant be stopped.

Karmic Guide - Kills itself after its done its work so you can use it again.  Getting back a fatty or a utility creature

Kitchen Finks - Some might think the life gain is irrelevant, throw it again, cast it, throw it again, etc.  Combos with Melira/Mikaeus.

Melira, but when the meta is cut-throat she goes right in.

Mikaeus

Necrotic Sliver - Vindicate that is a creature with a sacrifice built in

Qasali Pridemage - Remember what we said about creatures that have utility an are their own sac outlet?  This guy is great

Reveillark - VALUE TOWN

Ronom Unicorn - Personal sac outlet?  Check.  Utility?  Check.  A GOD DAMN UNICORN? CHECK CHECK CHECK.  Other cards similar include Kami of Ancient Law and Keening Apparition.

Sakura-Tribe Elder - Rampant growth on a creature that sacrifices itself.  Helps you get to Karador 2x and if you draw late game he suddenly disappears and becomes two new cards when his skull is burrowed through.

Shriekmaw - In a meta of mostly green decks

Solemn Simulacrum - Ramp on a creature that provides value when he dies

Soul of the Harvest - Similar to Harvest of Souls

Sun Titan - Notice all the &lt;4 cmc cards listed?  Ya

Sylvan Primordial - Huge blocker, all in one.  Whats not to love.  I still miss you prime time :'(.

Sylvok Replica - The body is extremely underwhelming for 3 mana

Ulamog, and hes a vindicate,  a 10/10 beater, and he is indestructible.

Viridian Zealot - Again

Wispmare - Not usually in deck anymore actually

Yosei

Kokusho - the Evening Star - Kokusho's life drain is great in a 3+ player game.  Being able to do it every turn is great too.

Blood Artist/Falkenrath Noble - Of the two

Butcher of Malakir - You are going to have your creatures die. A lot.  Why not make it so no one else can have creatures too?  He costs a ton

Crypt Ghast - Personally I do not use

Restoration Angel - Some thing this card is bad in EDH

Scavenging Ooze - So, well, here is the answer.  Also, again, great against graveyard strategies and the life gain adds up over time.

Bone Shredder - Terror on a self sacrifing stick

Vampire Hexmage - There is no dark depths combo here(mostly because I do not have one) but even without it this card stays in my deck because repeatedly killing planeswalkers for 2 mana is great value.  As well as killing creatures with out of control counters or even other permanents.

Massacre Wurm - Can cause huge pains for your opponents

Spore Frog - This card, but the deck generally only needs one of these type of effects.

Yavimaya Granger - Ramp on a 2/2 self sacrificing creature

Yavimaya Dryad - Ramp on a creature, helping them on their way with one of my own forests is great and allows for fun, interactive games.

Wood Elves - Clampable ramp

Farhaven Elf - See Wood Elves

Fertilid - In the same vein as Dryad

Spike Weaver - Whats better than one fog?  How about three!?

Krosan Tusker - Mana fixing and creature put into graveyard as well as a card drawn?  Sign me up.

Diligent Farmhand - Similar to Dawntreader Elk

Fleshbag Marauder - Using this while Butcher is on the field is almost cheating.  Just casting this every turn can deal with a ton of things that you normally couldnt.

Dauntless Escort - Sure

Riftsweeper - Great card for late game when you need a card that SOMEHOW got exiled.

Angel of Serenity - This card is at its best when you can flicker it

Hermit Druid - This card is great, so fuck him.

Jarad

Nezumi Graverobber - The problem with this card is that it is incredibly mana hungry.  Your deck just to operate normally is hungry for mana too.  I also found that too many times was there far too many cards in a graveyard to eat when I could do it much better with ooze.

---

Enchantments:

Animate Dead - Cheap reanimation

Aura Shards - MVP of the millenium.  This card does so much work against every single deck I have seen.  Most people try to get rid of this ASAP

Mirari's Wake - As I said earlier

Survival of the Fittest - Personally

Sylvan Library - Card draw when needed or filtering

Leyline of Sanctity - Sometimes you would like to overextend your graveyard

---

Instants:

Chord of Calling - A tutor

Grisly Salvage - This card actually reads draw 2-3 cards

Krosan Grip - Only here because pesky blue mages dont like me blowing up their Omniscience.  This'll teach 'em.

Path to Exile - Spot removal

Ready//Willing - You want your creatures dying when you say so

Swords to Plowshares - Spot removal

---

Lands:

Gaea's Cradle - Expensive

Bojuka Bog - Standard fare in black EDH decks.

High Market - Life gain over time adds up

Maze of Ith - I have been increasingly dissapointed with this card as of late

Strip Mine - Pesky land

Wasteland - Pesky land

Vesuva - Kill pesky legendary lands

Urborg - Does not do much here other than occasionally help fix mana

---

Planeswalkers:

Vraska - I mostly keep her in because I have a foil

Garruk Wildspeaker - Not in the deck most of the time anymore

## We used to be good

My friends and I play EDH almost exclusively now. A few of us used to play competitively, we're nice big fish in these tiny little ponds and can usually walk out with some prize.

We've sort of taken to EDH the same way. ""Let's build an awesome deck!"" Iona's a thing at our table, Olivia as a commander, and some of my scarier decks. 

We play with newer players who don't have huge collections to draw from, that are silly and have no win condition.

## Then Peter had a fantastic idea

We drafted for my friend's birthday ([lordmanimani](http://www.reddit.com/u/lordmanimani), I noticed my friend Peter brought his giant collection and had been rummaging through it, but didn't think much of it.

When we sat down for EDH

""Really

""Just wait!"" he assured with a devious smile that betrayed the jank within.

## He pulled 99 cards from a box that were the right colors

The shittiest rares. Ever seen Murder of Crows in EDH? I have now. Augury Owl? Oh yes. [This fucker](http://magiccards.info/ala/en/48.html) wiped our board as I was trying out a token deck. Then he handed the Sea Monster [a sword](http://magiccards.info/m12/en/222.html) (not one you might think) and wiped us again. Then he unearthed the bastard.

We played a 5+ hour game. He literally decked himself

## Responding in kind

I thought a lot about that game over the next week or so. Peter had a great idea:  why the hell am I spending money on decks when I bet I could build something stupid and janky without mail-ordering a thing.

A lot of people seem to agree that playing the obvious combo generals - Niv-Mizzet the Firemind, etc.

Combo generals get my ire, Arcum, Sharuum, Niv the Firemind, etc, because I know that if I don't interact with the player, they'll find a way to win non-interactively. 

The really easy-win Voltron generals, though a lot of people groan when they see Rafiq too.

1368999626.0,1enk5f,Critiquing EDH Decks,hijenx,31,6,8,"With the number of posts that are essentially a decklist and ""help me make my deck better"" I figured I would write how I go about critiquing an EDH deck.

**The Complete Critique**

The most 'helpful' way for me to critique a deck is to divide the deck into categories and comment on essentially a card by card basis: giving opinions on the cards I don't like as much, etc.  Now, the issue here is that I'm essentially just building my own deck around someone else's shell.  Sure, it may be a fairly good deck, but it's essentially mine now, not the person who originally submitted it.  

In most cases I will just skip over the cards that I agree with

So this includes:

* Summary of the deck in question
* Cards to take out
* Cards to put in
* Interactions between cards that are being put in
* Questions I have for the maker of the deck

**The Minor Critique**

I'll use this if I don't have much time. I'll also use this if the deck already has a review and I want to write a few other things that aren't already brought up.  This includes:

* A few cards I really think don't fit
* A few cards that I think are staples that aren't included
* Questions I have for the maker of the deck

**The Not-Very-Helpful Critique**

Sadly this is the one I usually see.  The main reason there are these critiques is because the OP just isn't helpful.  Here is what you will get if you submit a decklist with something like ""I just made this deck and haven't played it yet

* CARDNAME, you should run them because they're good.  
* Wait

**What to write if you want useful help**

In general it's helpful if you've already played your deck before submitting it

* What you think is the general strategy of the deck.
* Maybe decks that you're having issues against.
* Writing a little on the local Meta never hurts.
* Specific questions.  
* If you have a budget for changes.  
* How a usual run of the deck goes. (e.g. First I play Azusa on turn 3, then playing fatties.) - /u/mpaw975
* How you plan on ending the game. (Eventually I play Genesis Wave for 40 or Avenger of Zendikar + Craetorhoof Behemoth or Blightsteel Colossus) - /u/mpaw975

Now, Spin Into Myth, Hallowed Burial, and other spells which tuck important permanents (and your general) into your library.  The counterplay they provide is healthy.

What I think is excessive, though, is a deck with 10+ ways to search for unique cards in the deck and cobble together a fragile combo which ignores the rest of your deck entirely.  EDH, to me, not assembling a 3 card combo and packing your deck with filler tutors which only make your deck more consistent.

**WTF is ""Partial Paris""? I Ain't playin' no French Rules!**

""Mulligan"" refers to dumping your hand and grabbing 1 less card, requires a slightly better hand on average to have fun, hence [Partial Paris](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php). Basically, you draw your hand, drop as many cards as you want, then pick up that many cards from your deck. In the event that you want to do this again, then drop as many cards on the table again, drop 5 cards

**The Method**

Keep all [ramp](http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/List_of_Magic_slang#Ramp) and lands

**Why? I want to play stuff!**

Do I need to point out the obvious? You can't play stuff until you have the mana for it, but it doesn't mean shit against the HP-bag sitting across from you in EDH. The only creatures I play before turn 5 are creatures that ramp, draw me cards, or are just using up mana I can't spend on anything else.

**You have to be ruthless with your mulligans.**

You've got 3 lands, keep the sphinx (because it's so tasty!!!) , and draw 3? NO! FUCK YOU! Drop the damn sphinx! Lets calm down and think about this. Drawing three cards ain't that bad, right? You'll probably get a land or two on average. That'll put you at 4ish lands. By turn 5 you've had 4 draw phases, of which you need to have drawn 2 lands/ramp to get to 6 to play the sphinx on time. Not likely, but lets say you do. You play the sphinx on turn 6 after having 3+2 (cards you drew from mulling 3 + draw phases - land draws) that are most likely too expensive or not really that important. Congrats, you're drawing lots of cards, but at the end of the day

Lets look at some math for why aggressively mulligan is the way to go. The goal is to keep as many ramp/lands as possible

**Situation**: Start with 2 lands, one of which you REALLY like, and is amazing for you deck.

Decision 1: Keep the bomb.

Decision 2: Dump that shit.

**Decision 1**: drop 3

**Decision 2**: drop 4, drop 2 draw 1 (land). Total cards seen: 7+4+2+1=14.

Whether you get a land/ramp or not is obviously going to be random, wood elves, chromatic lantern. Obviously if you saw something you liked in the 2nd to last mull, you wouldn't do the last one, but the point stands.

What you should get away from all of that is, and play. It's still in there! I promise. And what's better, it'll come when you have a nice little blanket of mana to wrap around his little face so he can be all comfortable with some friends before he gets out there on the battlefield and mauls the shit out of that prick that put a Blightsteel in his deck. Do it for Jace. It's for his own good. World Peace.

**""This doesn't apply to me! I play controlly wizard man-powers deck!""**

Not true, but Vintage/Legacy/Modern/Standard are WAY more fun for competitive 1v1s. If you know better, and defy this rule (only keeping ramp and mana), that's because you've tried this method, experimented, and found a card you can actually keep over the possibility of another land or ramp.

**""But I don't have any green in my deck! KREENNNKOOOOO \*Django Theme\*""**

A wise EDH player at my LGS once said that if your deck doesn't have green or isn't heavy on artifacts, Red) and expect to have fun, you're going to want to play your shit on time, and sticking lands in your deck isn't going to be enough. You're going to need that Lantern, lots of rocks, and expect to be using those 20 dollar tutors to get more damn land. The only thing worse than not having what you need in your hand, is having what you need in your hand

If you keep any cards that you cannot play given the lands/ramp that you already have (this includes ramp), you have 6 draw phases to get 1 land. Pretty reasonable. If you have 3 lands and a 6-drop, you have 6 draw phases to get 3 lands. Much more difficult. Apply this thought process for each time you're deciding what to drop from your hand.

Ex) You have 4 lands, and it's ramp! Lets think about this. If you draw no other ramp, then it's going to be turn 7 that you want to drop Boundless Realms. This means that you had 7 draw phases to get 3 lands (if you ramp at all, you have less draw phases than that). 3/7 is right on the line between smart and risky. That's a tough call. If you start with only 2 lands and a Boundless Realms, you definitely want to drop that Boundless Realms in the first Mull, due to how many more cards you'll be able to look at and decide to keep, if you just Mull that one extra card.

**Exceptions I've found to this rule:**

* Demonic Tutor / cheap CMC tutors - because it could always turn itself into a land

* Phyrexian arena - if you have the lands to play it already -- better chance to not miss a land drop

* Liliana of the Dark Realms (if you have the lands to play her already in hand)

* Garruk Wildspeaker - he actually is ramp

* Oracle of Mul Daya - same as Garruk

The main thing to think about for the exceptions is that you need the mana ALREADY in your hand or they need to be dropped. If I have a demonic Tutor, I'll keep it, of course.

**All of that being said...**

Keep in mind that MTG is a game of risks and rules. Start with a set of rules in your mind about how you think the game should be played, good or bad. Without reflecting back on how your ideologies were different and what outcomes they caused, you cannot improve.

Take the example of an idea I often use while drafting, I think about what would have happened if I had picked the enchantment instead, and had drawn the enchantment right when I had drawn the creature. Would there have been a difference? Is that difference caused by a niche situation, or is it objectively much more common in this set to be facing this situation (lots of creature removal, for instance), and the general rule of ""creature first"" isn't a good rule to have? Always challenge your rules, or your game won't evolve. Which, to me

I hope this method can improve some people's fun. I know it has for almost everyone in my playgroup that we've gotten into EDH. I said a lot of controversial things up there so feel free to flame me below and we can teach each other a little more about the game we love. I'd also be open to answering questions about specific hands and what I would mull.

1352131772.0,12o78g,[Anecdote] 6-Player Multiplayer Last Saturday Night,katarr,26,5,20,"I know myself


EDIT: Added Gatherer links to each Commander.


Last Saturday my family threw a big party (50+ people) and I (knowing that there would be many Magic players there) let everyone know to bring their Commander decks (if they had them)


Eventually, and the other three borrowed my decks. One of these three hadn't played Magic at all since 7th Edition!


The decks were

1) Me - [Maelstrom Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=265154) (Mine)

2) Guy Who Hadn't Played in Years (Danny) - [Skullbriar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236485) (Mine)

3) My Best Friend (Steve) - [Experiment Kraj](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107385) (His own)

4) My Brother (Ian) - [Child of Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180516) (NOTE: Based off of the ""JUDGE!"" deck posted here a few weeks ago) (Mine)

5) My Brother's Best Friend (Geoffrey) - [Elesh Norn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214352) (His own)

6) Random Dude (Sean) - [Thelon of Havenwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=116737) (Mine)


We shuffle up


The early turns start out simply, nothing too fancy. Ian drops a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044) for emergencies, but everyone is generally cordial. Danny brings out [Skullbriar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=236485), but most people have blockers, so he's not gaining very many counters. An amusing moment occurs when he draws [Garruk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247323), blinks, and goes ""What the fuck is this?""


Meanwhile


Then Danny drops [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220583). 


One full set of turns goes by.


Forgotten Ancient has 10 +1/+1 counters on it. Luckily, and we had to do something. But no one had an answer. The closest thing was Geoffrey, who had [Scepter of Dominance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174792), but that just kept him from attacking, not from gaining counters. And gain counters he did, all (now) 18 of them. If that scepter gets destroyed, one person is doomed per turn.


Ian manages to destroy the Forgotten Ancient by sacrificing Child of Alara somehow to stop Skullbriar getting more counters (along with the  [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266274) I had of it), and he has more than enough mana to cast it again and again.


It's Ian's turn, and Ian passes the turn, knowing full well what is to happen next.


Geoffrey draws, except Geoffrey, who has 18 3/3 soldiers. Skullbriar is tapped, and suddenly Danny takes around 35 to the face. Game over for him.


Everyone breathes a sigh of relief


The turn goes around, only) major move, casts [Phyrexian Ingester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214384), imprinting Elesh Norn. She bounces immediately to the Command Zone, but the hope is someone can counter her or something. The hope never materializes. Elesh comes out again, and this time it is Steve who bites the dust. 


And now there is 4.


Ian decides it is time for things to get silly. He casts [Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190187). 


And suddenly, and now it is my turn. 


I cast Maelstrom Wanderer, but I end up casting [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46424) at a storm count of 7. Ian copies it, but this only gives him the one copy.


I end up taking a 25 minute or so turn


In the end, has [Ivory Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83413) out from the Warp World., so he's out. So I deal out the copies evenly to Sean and Ian. We resolve Sean's first, and he dies.


Then we resolve Ian's. As the life is ticking down


He has a [Tainted Sigil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180618).


I facepalm as I remember the Acidic Soil


Ian's turn. He plays [Shared Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=49764).


I blink a couple of times, and scoop.


After about 15 minutes, he could cast essentially nothing, while Ian could cast anything he drew from Geoffrey's deck. Ian swung in with Geoffrey's own creatures, and the game was over.




There were a few more plays in there that I left out that were moderately interesting


In the end, laughing, and having a great time. Exactly what I think EDH/Commander is all about.

This deck was created out of the ashes of a straight up control Grand Arbiter deck that won by doing stuff like Stasis/Capsize.  I loved/hated that deck so I switched up to a bant deck



This is probably deck 1a in terms of my favorite decks to play.  It has an answer for most things



The biggest issue this deck has is generating consisted card advantage.  I tend to run out of gas and if I don't have any good defensive pieces in place I get run over by faster/combo decks.  Looking at it



I'd like to try and find a better balance between the ramp/draw/defensive support cards.  Spending wise



My metagame has a mix of incredibly power/fast combo decks and stompers however mostly the decks are fairly Johnny and have been trending that way.  I don't need to really worry about heavy countermagic

Now
**Hibernation's End:** Great Card

**Golgari Grave-Troll:** I don't ~~play creatures~~ leave creatures in the graveyard very often

**Troll Ascetic:** Not good in commander. Not nearly enough impact on the board state.

**Sins of the Past:** None of my instants or sorceries give enough of a value to be worth paying six for a second use

**Skullbriar, because my deck was built around larger creatures.

**Druid's Repository:** Has helped before, I often attack only two or three times in a game, so it rarely gets counters.

Now for some cards I would like to consider as potential replacements for what I would take out:

**Ashes to Ashes:** Amazing card

**Black Sun's Zenith:** Good board wipe that recurs itself

**Beacon of Unrest:** More recursion

**Decree of Pain:** Board wipe and card advantage. Probably wouldn't use it AND BSZ.

**Spiritmonger:** Efficiently costed

**Butcher of Malakir:** Grave Pact on legs. Large

**Scavenging Ooze:** Life Gain and grave hate. All around good card.

On the Ruric Thar player's turn, I target my Rune-Scarred Demon to see if I can find anything to do. I decide to leave my Triskelion in the deck so that in case I hit it off of MY Primal Surge (thank you, Hive Mind), I can insta-win with my Mikaeus. I grab Rakdos Charm instead. My copy of Primal Surge goes off first. I get Darksteel Colossus and one other card, doesn't matter. The Atogatog player is next. He hits a couple lands and Possibility Storm. Kaalia wiffs pretty hard. Of course, the Ruric Thar deck goes bonkers and hits a TON of permanents. He gets Akroma's Memorial, Urabrask the Hidden, Woodfall Primus, and due to Possibility Storm, the Ruric Thar player

Fast forward a few turns later. My board position is pretty much the same minus my Kaervek. Kaalia actually has some threats and is probably going to win during his next turn. He has 5 creatures and 8 life. The Atogatog guy made everyone draw a bunch of cards and hit a Copy Enchantment through Possibility Storm, letting each player get a free Demonic Tutor. I'm looking through my deck and notice something beautiful. I have exactly 2 instants left in my deck: Dark Ritual and the Rakdos Charm from before. So I search for Dark Ritual, of course! During my turn, I cast Dark Ritual. With the triggers of both Hive Minds and the Possibility Storm on the stack, the Kaalia player attempts to Swords to Plowshares his Balefire Dragon. So the Atogatog player gets two copies of Swords, as do I, and the Possibility Storm is still on the stack for the original Swords. The Atogatog player uses one Swords on his own 5/5 and one targeting the Balefire Dragon. I target both of mine at the Balefire Dragon as well. So now the Kaalia player has 4 creatures and 14 life. The Possibility Storm on the Swords turns into a Vampiric Tutor, since I know what I'm going into with the Possibility Storm on my own Dark Ritual. He has no further responses, ""And with that

Rules of the thread: The card you're suggesting a replacement for must be greater than $10 in price, try to keep it below $2. It's a singleton format, after all!

(We touched on this in another thread a bit back

My suggestion:

Sensei's Divining Top ---&gt; Soothsaying

Soothsaying is limited to blue, and can actually go deeper than the Top thanks to the X activation cost. While this means it costs more to hit the 3 cards Top hits, it means you can dump excess mana at the end of an opponent's turn to dig pretty deep, and plan out your next, like, 10 turns. Beyond that, you can actually shuffle your deck if you've dug deep and found that Islands are all you can expect for the foreseeable future. No, but as far as deck-stacking and combo-digging goes,,

1365075274.0,1bnks7,Lands for colourless EDH - an investigation,sebbyk,21,3,24,"I had a discussion earlier today about mana bases for colourless EDH decks on r/MagicTCG

The following information was all gleaned from Gatherer. The prices are TCG mid-price. Some of what I say below may be incorrect



There are 143 different lands which can legally be run in a colourless EDH deck. 

(Technically

Some lands are utterly pointless in a colourless EDH deck

- Pillar of the Paruns

- Fetch lands (Onslaught

- Evolving Wilds/Teramorphic Expanse/Thawing Glaciers

- Meteor Crater 

- Command Tower



This leaves us with 122 lands. 

Of these
The offenders are: 

- Vesuva (although
- The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale
- Dark Depths
- Oasis
- Sorrow’s Path
- Island of Wak-Wak
- Eye of Ugin
- Arena
- Safe Haven
- Ice Floe
- Maze of Ith
- Bazaar of Baghdad 
- Diamond Valley
- Glacial Chasm 
- Halls of Mist
- The cycle of “bands with other legendary creatures” lands (Adventurer’s Guildhouse, Seafarer’s Quay, Unholy Citadel)






The most expensive land you could run in a colourless EDH deck is Mishra’s Workshop ($400).

There are 16 lands over $10

This means that there are a whopping 63 lands which cost less than $1 and can be run in a colourless EDH deck. Even though some of these are terrible

If you wish to develop your mana base, very few of the lands which you can run in a colourless EDH deck cost more than $5. 

Hopefully this puts the myth that the mana base for a colourless deck is expensive to rest once and for all. 

EDIT: moved Thawing Glaciers to the list of cards which are practically useless in a colourless deck.

I'm here to get your opinions and feedback on a format I've been working on for a short time. As you read the general rules and guidelines to the format please understand that we've not actually begun playtesting yet as we have to have a fairly firm set of rules before we can even begin constructing the cube. If you see anything that can obviously be improved or simply doesn't work as is please let me know. This is why I'm showing this to you! Criticism!

That being said... **What is Command Cube?**  
Command Cube is a variation of both the Commander and Cube formats. The format follows all of the rules (aside from the Commander ban list)

**Why is Command Cube worth playing?**  
It's hard to balance your local meta. One of the most common comments I see here on r/EDH is people complaining about a particular archetype making their meta unfair and little fun. Too much land destruction ruins some people's day. For others combo decks just wreck them. Some prefer pillow forting and hate aggro. Some hate pillow forters and just want to hit them in the face. The reason for these issues is because we tune our decks week after week until they play out just right. Those pillow forts are made of the softest down and the combo decks have all the right tutors. Variety is sacrificed for competitiveness as someone will always ramp up the odds for everyone. Arms races can kill metas. Command Cube helps stop that by giving a fixed card pool and putting everyone (even the noobs) on an even level.  

**Well
Well.. We're figuring that out. Right now we have a general outline as to how the format should work.  
1. For an 8 player draft there is a card pool of 800 cards.  
2. The card pool is split into 40 twenty card packs.  
3. 1/5th of the packs contain only Legendary creatures.  
4. Commanders are drafted first

Yup! It's that simple. The idea is first you draft a number of Commanders you may want to build around. Choosing a variety of colors or redundant colors (a RUG general, but everyone has their own way of doing things. From there you begin to draft, attempting to pick cards that you might think will fit in your deck. In the end each players has 15 legendary creatures and 85 other cards. From this they build a 100-card singleton deck.

**What's the catch..?**  
Well, not Riku getting his jollies in the corner again.   

Tribal decks are also rather hard to build unless they cube dedicates each color to one or two card types. This is bad news as many of the favorite decks (IE: Elves &amp; Slivers) are likely to be non-existent in this format

Mono color decks can be difficult to run depending on how the cube is built. Luckily mono-color legends can just be played in multicolor decks if you can't scrounge up enough of the particular color.

Those are the major issues I already foresee for the format but hey.. If I wanted a game just like EDH I'd play EDH

**Possible Changes**  
Still

*An open card pool*  
My playgroup and I have discussed having a large pool of mediocre cards, any cards you trade into the pool can be taken by other players as we go around. It would be almost like a second round of drafting. Once we go around the table once without anyone taking a card the open pool closes and we deck build.

First thing's first

**The Main Idea**

The point of this deck is to gain life, we let other players knock each other out, then try to get off an enormous Serra Avatar, or win outright with Felidar Sovereign. The dream is to have Doubling Season and Trostani out, play Ajani, make two avatars, then get Trostani to make two more. Your life goes up 16-fold. God forbid you also have Rhox Faithmender out too...

**The Deck**

The deck plays 6 [soul sisters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;text=+[%22gain+1+life%22]+[battlefield]+[%22another+creature%22]&amp;type=+[%22Creature%22]) including Trostani.

&gt; Soul Warden, Auriok Champion, Suture Priest

Combined with creatures that have ""**ETB gain some life**"" we try to get up to 80 life within the first 8 turns. There are tons of really bad creatures in the history of magic that do this - Venerable Monk? - so this deck only runs high-impact ones. Lone Missionary is the outlier

&gt; Jaddi Lifestrider, Loxodon Hierarch, Thragtusk

From there we run a variety of **flicker** and pseudo-flicker effects to keep the life-gain-train going. (This deck is still in the works

&gt; Flickerwisp, Otherworldly Journey, Flicker

We also are running a **4-post package** (mostly for the hilarity)

&gt; Cloudpost, Thespian's Stage, Expedition Map, Knight of the Reliquary

Once we are floating around 80 life

&gt; Serra Avatar

Other **big cards** that work well in our deck. Saproling Burst is a total beast. With *only* Trostani out

&gt; Ageless Entity, Eternity Vessel, True Conviction, Saproling Burst

Finally, but frankly, I don't really care about getting a Felidar win. If anything I would tutor up KotR to get 4-post online.

&gt; **Tutors**: Enlightened Tutor, Sterling Grove

&gt; **Win Cons**: Felidar Sovereign, True Conviction

1365489760.0,1bz53l,Animorphs - Giving some love to an awesome ability,coversation,20,4,10,"Morph does not get enough love in EDH. It's so tricky

[Here's the current list](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/animorphs/)

Anyway, all morph creatures are free to cast face-down (and why would you ever want to cast a creature face-up?). There are several ways to exploit this, and the most broken way I could think of is to use [Cloudstone Curio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89089). Once Animar is on 3 counters, you can chain-bounce two morph creatures, pumping Animar up arbitrarily high. Big dude = big damage, and his protection acts as natural evasion (but there's also a [Rogue's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=277992) to get through). 

Now, and [Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366283) are for. These allow you to draw your entire deck and chuck lands at anything that moves, clearing the way for a massive morph swing.

There is also the stasis-like interaction between [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189245) and [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109765). This effectively creates a lock on your opponents' permanents

That covers the main combos in the deck

Definitely open to suggestions on improving this one. I know some people frown on infinite combos in EDH--I never include them in my other decks--but let's be honest here. A deck centered around morph is going to need a little help from broken cards like the Curio.",,t5_2scee,False,,BGS,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1bz53l/animorphs_giving_some_love_to_an_awesome_ability/

I want to tech out two more casual decks that I can bring around with me to show off the format.

Doing a little searching around I found two commanders I am interested in building around. 

Experiment Kraj 

http://deckbox.org/sets/212238

 looks like it could be a lot of fun.  It's a little janky but I've always found creature centric light combos to be entertaining.  This is my list so far.  I'm trying to keep the budget as tight as I can. We're all casual players so shouldn't be too difficult.  I do want to try and keep it from relying on mill and/or infinite damage combos.

The second commander is Thelon of Havenwood 

http://deckbox.org/sets/212635

I am an unabashed lover of alternative tribal decks.  My first set was Fallen Empires and I have always had an affinity for fungus.  I keep going back and forth between Thelon and Ghave

Any advice for either of these decks would be very helpful.

My brother who loves screwing things up played a Worldpurge with 13 minutes left on the clock.  My brother being the clever man he was kept a precinct captain and a Champion of the Perish.  Luckily he was beating down the Aurelia deck before he got to me.  I got my doubling season on the battlefield thankfully.  Then with about thirty seconds left with an avenger of zendikar on the battlefield I cast my Zegana from my hand getting her 14 +1/+1 counters.

These are by no means bad submissions by default, and there's nothing worse than ordering some cards for an EDH deck and later realising that they really aren't what you are looking for!

It's not a perfect comparison by any means, [standard], [RTR draft] etc which really help find what you are looking for, and you know fairly well what kind of issues are at hand in a particular thread before you click. 

I would respectfully suggest that tags for posts could greatly improve the functionality of this subreddit with tags like [tested], [casual/kitchen table], [tuning], [deck staples], [aggro], [control], [combo].

UPDATE!
Thanks guys

Commander: Sharuum
Colors (U/B/W): I think I would like to stay primarily blue
Style: Control - I know Sharuum can be used for some sick game-breaking combos

Cool cards I'd like to include:  
1) All of the awesome Artifact and Blue Sphinx (Enigma Sphinx, Sphinx of Magosi, Sphinx of the Steel Wind, Summoner, Sovereign, Uthuun, etc)
2) Card draw! Can't get enough!
3) Late game big blue spells that are tactical and fun (Rite of Replication for instance).


===Old Post:===

I'm going to outline some basic goals for what I'm interested in

Colors: Blue or Black


Previous notes: I had toyed with doing a Dimir-style draw/discard deck with Sygg, Underworld Dreams, and Liliana's Caress. However, since this is for such a friendly play-group, I think focusing on punishing discard may be a bit too hostile. I love mill but I'm skipping it for the same reason; I'd like a deck that's as fun to play against as it is to pilot.


I am leaning more and more towards mono-blue Combo/Control. I'd love to get some use out of Reliquary Tower, with an emphasis on late game big Sphinxes (cos they're fun).


Any ideas for a commander? Staple cards that fit this style and are fun to use? Combos that aren't too frustrating to play against?
I really appreciate it!

This deck is the response to the post I made in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1i33no/who_was_your_first_general_and_who_is_your/)

I posted a very brief description of it on Tappedout

This is an infinite combo based deck that relies on the fair draw engine of various Howling Mine effects. The game plan as well as the concept is twofold:

1. Use a mass draw engine to execute an infinite combo

2. Because everybody gets to draw cards

I put fairly in quotations because we can back up the combo with free and under costed counterspells, and draws gas. That is why it is my personal favorite EDH deck to play, it is always fun.

Ill give a brief description of the cards and how they interact to make the deck work.

Howling Mines (Font of Mythos

The backbone of the deck. This allows you to draw into your combo, or hard ramp decks like Azusa to go nuts, but it is what I like most about the deck. People tend to ignore strong plays like mana doublers when they are drawing 5 cards a turn. Standstill is my favorite, I like to play it, put my hand face down on the table, fold my hands and say ""Take your time"" Nobody wants to be the guy who cracks Standstill.

""No Maximum Hand Size"" (Library of Leng

These are the next most important cards next to the mines. These let you keep a full grip of cards at almost all times, as it stops your opponents from discarding Eldrazi or triggering ""Whenever X is put into graveyard, shuffle your graveyard into your library"" effects. My favorite is Venser's Journal, it gains you a ton of life.  

Punishers (Iron Maiden, Mass Bounce effects)

These are the cards that are able to subtly exploit your opponent's having a large amount of cards in hand. Iron is my favorite, Back to Basics is back-breaking in the vast majority of EDH decks I see, even in mono-colored. Your opponents can't play anything if their lands don't untap, obviously. Jushi Apprentice is my favorite, it can make your opponents draw their deck when you flip him into Tomoya. 

Protection (Propaganda

This deck runs a very low number of creatures, I activated Tomoya in response to put 40 cards total in hand, first time I ever saw a resolved Craterhoof not win.

Clones

Pretty self explanatory

Ramp
Again

Mana Doublers (Caged Sun

These cards are insane. They are they key to infinite comboing, you can *just* play free counterspells. I cannot stress enough how much these affect gameplay in EDH, these are the reason Disenchant variants always go into green/white decks.

Counterspells (Force of Will

These protect your combo most importantly, one for yourself, and another one for when the table looks to the mono blue player to stop something degenerate. Free ones are the best, but splashy ones like Desertion and Draining Whelk keep the game fun.

Combo engines (Mind Over Matter

These are the cards that win you the games, I'll just go over the main ones.

Palinchron+Mana Doubler= Infinite mana. With this you can:
Draw you deck(BSZ
Make your opponent draw their deck
Steal all permanents (Memnarch)
Bounce all permanents (Capsize

Mind Over Matter+Nearly Everything.
Seriously, and my favorite blue card ever. Even if you can't combo, you can make tons of mana with a doubler and a land, or a Gilded Lotus, and draw a bunch of cards with Stroke of Genius to continue making mana. If, under odd circumstances, you can't do that, Mind becomes the Fuck You Button. Your opponents can't attack

Omniscience+Enter the Infinite

The ultimate duh combo in magic. Honestly, tables usually have more than 5 steps. As much as I don't like this combo, it is very powerful and wins upon execution. I could see taking this combo out in the future.

Anyway, or hard card draw. The only thing I could do to improve it is add more expensive blue cards, currently my Force of Will is gold bordered. I would love to add some more untap land cards like Treachery and Time Spiral, as this deck plays kinda like a High Tide deck, also i would love a Misdirection. My dream cards would definitely be Mana Drain, Jace TMS, and Timetwister, comments,False,

Furnace of Wrath/Gratuitous Violence end games.

Chord of Calling lets you play a land and bounce one back. This is sweet for Valakut, replaying if you can play more than one land turn, or just late game to return lands with ramp spells to throw with Borborygmos.

Storm Cauldren lets you pick up all your lands to destroy someone.

So ever since I saw this guy I've been trying to brainstorm ways to make him useful. It's really a shame that he isn't Red/Blue because if he were you could actually make a pretty sick deck with him (also I think it makes more sense with regards to the color pie). Nonetheless I still think he could make an interesting general. I've found some cool stuff but I'm having trouble getting enough cards to make a deck

This deck is in the same vein as 99-Land Ashling and it is the stupidest deck I have ever won with (sitting on 3/0 W/L).  No small feat in the cut-throat Casual circles.  

I have exactly 2.5 win-cons (Maniac, attacking with 37 Shadowborn Apostles turn 7) and I have many ways of getting to them.  

--------------------------------------------
1.) Sphinx + 2 Apostles in hand + Doomsday (choosing at least 2 Apostles and 3 of whatever) + (counter magic possibly) + Lab Maniac

2.) Sphinx + A ton of Apostles in hand + Lab Maniac/Kombat

3.) Thrumming Stone + Orrery/Leyline + Apostle + Rune-Scarred Demon + Mortal Kombat EOT

4.) The all important Demonic Consultation + ""Aquus Steed"" + Lab Maniac combo

5.) Extractor Demon + Kill many Apostles + (Dark Prophecy) + Lab Maniac/Kombat

-----------------------------------------------

I have some tutors in here to search for whatever combo piece I want for whichever combo I want to do.  I've hit #1 once and #3 twice thus far.  

One reason I am sharing this is because I am very proud of how stupidly Johnny it is while also being cheap and fragile enough to make those very infrequent wins so worthwhile that you'll fall in love with EDH all over again.

Another reason is that I think I want to make it a bit faster/more consistent.  I'm thinking of taking out something (cut the mass reanimation probably? Suicide UB would be fine and more efficient) and adding in more card draw or something else to speed this deck up.  Part of me dares to try to make this even marginally competitive

I want to make the most evil, being a douche will not lose you friends. Unfortunately, I have no idea what I'm doing.

I am currently facing a dilemma and would love some suggestions. (Okay, and it became a giant blender of concepts.  Though I think two clear ideas hinge out.

----

**Ninjas and Mirrors:**

Commanders(?): Lasav, Wrexial, (maybe Circu) 

So more around having a lot of ninjas, its set in the realms of U/B and all the scary things in there.  

Looking at how the theme really goes I imagine it has to be swift and dexterous with not a lot of place for patiently toying away at people.  So like the name-sake it has to be good at quick assassinations.  On the other hand it will have access to cloning which is one of my favorite things to do in any game. Unlike the following it will most likely have less ""yours is mine"" and more ""ohhh let me copy that and then destroy it.""

Fun Themes/Combos: Vela + Rite of Replication, etc.), Wonder (flying ninjas!)

* Benefits: Most likely more consistent than latter, possible to go voltron-ish, more tribal

* Cons: More aggressive than I would like

----

**Grand High Court:**

Commander: Merike ri Berit 

This is more based on my fond memories of Merieke ri Berit, or access to a good exile.  I'm also a sucker for white because Linvala, Keeper of Silence is one of my favorite cards and I try to include it whenever I can.  Unlike the theme above this is completely based in nostalgia, but it is closer to my personal play style.  

Fun Themes/Combos: Elesh Norn + Sheoldred, Demon/Angel Subtheme, Storm Herd, Mind Control

* Benefits: Oh so many fun mini-combinations and themes, versatile, let's exile things

* Flaws: most likely just stuffed more of things I like rather (this single statement says a lot...I think.)  Though the format is/can be casual

----

Things that kinda go in both: Serendib Sorcerer + Beguiler of Wills, Counter Spells, Temporal Extortion, Infinite Mana...for something?

----

I really don't know which one I like better.  Personally I'm very fond of both, usually I build things centered around fun combos than anything else; since I play more for themes/interactions, it doesn't matter to me much if I win or not.

(aka What do you consider first when building a deck?),possiblyoc,9,1,17,"I'm interested in seeing what r/EDH thinks is most important about a deck. Powerful sorceries? Large creatures? Mass/spot removal? Counters? Board diplomacy? Mana Ramp? Control-oriented cards? etc.

In my opinion

100 cards is a lot for a deck. Every card in a deck should be picked for a certain purpose and in order to respond to the situations that come up during a game you need to be able to have the appropriate tool (card). If you just go around drawing one card per turn the chances of you having that tool in hand when a threat arises is very slim. Whether it is by directly tutoring for a certain card or just rolling the dice and hoping you get it by drawing more cards than each opponent

Having draw / card advantage is also necessary if you want to keep from stalling out after a strong start to a game. The worst thing that can happen to you in a game is for your hand to get depleted and then have no way of drawing more than one card per turn. The more cards you draw per turn the more spells you can potentially play. Playing more spells inevitably advances your board position compared to opponents with inferior card advantage and pushes you towards victory. Card advantage and being able to replenish your hand also makes you incredibly resilient against board sweepers since you will be able to recover quickly. 

When I go to make a new deck the first thing that I look at is the deck's potential for card advantage. Only once I feel like I will be able to out-card-advantage my opponents do I go further into the building process and find the utility creatures / other spells that I want to play.

So r/EDH...what are the first things that all of you look for when deciding to build a new deck?

In a fashion similar to Archenemy

I want to see a commander-theme game mode that feels like this; a boss deck with packs of monsters and spells, a pumped final boss.

We've all heard of Archenemy, to simulate an old MMORPG. What do you all think? I've got a few ideas, but I'd love to hear some suggestions, or to be pointed in the right direction if something like this exists.

Update! 

I've been reading over the old WoW TCG Rules

Players would play against mini-bosses. These are creatures with very large health pools, bosses would play face-down small creatures as ""resources,"" which are functionally identical to lands. They would then be able to cast spells, attack enemy heroes, etc. 

After the boss is defeated

The Final boss has a special

For a Commander variant, a selection of boss legendarily including a final legendary, and a deck of boss spells.

Players would play reduced-length rounds of Horde Magic

A boss round would be more similar to archenemy. The dungeon player would begin with that boss commander in play. They would need some other advantage to keep even pace with the players; I haven't decided what yet, mana, immunity to whipes, or the like. That boss would be defeated when the dungeon player had lost a sufficient amount of life.

A final boss would be nearly identical to the above, more draw steps, or some other mechanic.

The challenge of this variant format would be to test players to stretch their life totals. Horde-magic breaking spells wouldn't be as effective against bosses. Quick combo engines would leave players exposed to later fights. Losing a commander too many times may make playing them impossible by the last round. Thoughts?

I'd prefer thematically linked boss choices, featuring Crosis, Bolas, Sedris, Thraximundar, and the like.",,,RGWS,

After getting in about a week a foil niv-mizzet (izzet vs golgari), I felt the calling to make a U/R EDH deck, the color combination that is my favorite, but one that I actually never built.  I didn't want to use the original Niz Mizzet as the general, to remove any doubt that I'm not playing the infinite-damage combo, so Dracogenius steps up to the plate.

It's a pretty simple concept, card draw, and dragons.  Mana to cast dragons, card draw to draw more dragons to cast, and dragons.  Cause dragons.

I got to play it this past Sunday for the first time, and one single-handedly could do it's fair share of damage...not to mention late-game shenanigans with the Dracogenius himself.

Probably the funnest play of the day, and attacked right into me.  I had a Belbe's Portal out, but an empty hand, so I popped mind stone, drew the classic Shivan Dragon, flashed him into play, and pumped 1 to trade.  Felt good.

I'm back again to ask for sagely advice on Jhoira since I have a very limited knowledge of MTG. I'd appreciate it if you guys would be brutally honest in your opinions. 

Testing out the new Jenara deck though I ran into 2 or 3 things in my meta that didn't sit right with my stomach:

 First

Then an infinite turn lock by the same player and no one bats an eye. 

The final rule...and the one that people told me I wasn't allowed to break: Mass Land Destruction. No less than 3 times playing against Zur the Enchanter were all my lands blown up as Jenara (I wasn't even aware Zur could do this but apparently it happened). Again

Now I feel cheated. I got rid of Jhoira, you'll know I don't typically play Magic. I was very on and off and Suspend was a cool mechanic I just happened to really love. I didn't know playing the only real suspend general would get me all the hate in the world)... everything I was told was thrown in my face.


Here is the current iteration of my Jhoira deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/1st-edh-deck-jhoira/


**The Problem**

The question becomes now which road do I take? Do I go all in with Mass Land Destruction and just be the asshole who plays this deck if people are going to go ""High Power"" and I'll just use Jenara when they're willing to be nice? Or do I try my best to make the deck powerful without going all in?


**Issues with the Deck at the Moment**


I have very little experience with this iteration of the deck (I do not yet own all the cards for it...surprisingly most of them being cheap commons. The expensive stuff I already have) but generally my deck struggles early on. Either I get run over by aggressive threats before anything I have can hit the board or I have a really fast start in ramping but I have no threats to suspend. 

I assumed that the best way to answer this was to stack my deck with cards like Ponder

This deck currently just replicates a ton of turns and beats people down with one fatty until nothing remains. It's consistency in winning is entirely dependent on how long I last. Usually if I can live about 10+ turns around the board


**Creatures: Am I even playing the right ones?**

Tidespout Tyrant has consistently been mediocre for me for almost a year and a half. Am I not using him correctly?

I keep hearing Bogardan Hellkite is a card I should be playing but I'm not.

Kiki Jiki has always been a card I felt I should be playing but the whole stigma that comes with him is something my group hates. There is someone at the table who is now regularly playing him and again... no one bats any eye. If we're going down the ""I'm going to be a dick"" route


**If I'm going Mass LD...**

Which ones do I play? How many?


**On Manabase**

I don't think I need to change anything here. I've almost never had any issues paying for anything. If you feel an Artifact or Utility Land is necessary for this deck to be viable


**On the issue of $$$...**

I don't have unlimited funds, let me know. I'll add it to a wish list and try to grab it further down the line. 

This deck has been revised so many times that I'm simply sick of having it be ""lackluster."" I personally have fun with this deck even if others may or may not. That said, so be it.

Perhaps it is best to just have a transformational sideboard so I can go from being ""Nice"" to ""Jerkface"" depending on how people want to play it.

So, really wanted to build this deck. I want to keep the flavour there while still trying to make it as good as possible.

I thought out of all the other monob generals his Thrulls would fit perfect with the sacrifice clauses of big demons, black sacrifice artifacts and for Skullclamp targets.

I don't feel that going B/R gives enough to justify it. I'd love to hear what people think about this though. I obviously may be wrong here as I'm still somewhat new to the format and don't have the knowledge of cards that some players do. It's mostly for Multiplayer and not 1v1. Group has a mix of competitive players to casual players and proxies are 100% allowed. I didn't want to run Imperial Seal because it's just too good to proxy - I also wouldn't mind fully buying this deck if I enjoy it. But suggest things even if they are expensive!

Long post incoming! I'm looking for some advice on how to revise my Jenara EDH deck for when I meet up with a bunch of friends next month to play several EDH games.  I'm hoping Reddit can give me some awesome advice like it has in the past and try to help me make the deck better on a budget. 

**I'm trying to improve this deck as much as possible with a $70 budget**

**About Me and my Playgroup**

I'm not a regular Magic player. I played a little when I was in middle school for a few months, I know that competitive play is a lot of money so if you want the best, you have to pay a lot. I was drawn to EDH because I loved multiplayer formats in other CCGs and this was a way to play with my MTG friends and have a lot of fun in a social way with them. That said, they're all very competitive so striking a balance of competitive and fun is key for me. Mass Land D and Infinite Combos are probably out but there are still some pretty powerful and expensive cards flying about in my meta.

Commanders I'm usually playing against include Zur, Riku, Drana, Azami, Edric, Sedris, Azusa

**Cards I'd Like to Keep that I Realize may be underwhelming**

*Avacyn

*Iona

*Yosei

**Cards I'm Considering Cutting**

*True Conviction* - It doesn't seem to do much unless I'm sitting on Jenara with a sword. Very rarely do I actually get any benefit from it but I recognize it's pretty good... I just think there's gotta be something better than this card.

*Aura Shards* - I don't think I've ever actually got the effect off more than once a game but I recognize that Artifact/Enchantment removal is good and that it is reusable. It is a dead draw early and late game

*Day of Judgment* -  I play too many Wrath effects I feel. This is the worst one.

*Trygon Predator* - Artifact removal. It has no synergy with the deck other than it's colors.

*Dauntless Escort* - Friends talked me into this cause it has synergy with Sun Titan...but what doesn't? Super underwhelming middle and late game as I can easily get Avacyn

*Mystic Snake* - He's strong...but is he better than Restoration Angel? I really need help with this one guys.


**Cards I wanted to add**

1 or 2 larger late game creatures simply because I find that unless I win super early (doesn't happen in a 5 or 6 person game usually) I don't have enough power houses besides Avacyn to stand up to the rest of the table. These include...

*Ulamog/Kozilek/Blightsteel* -I own the Eldrazi Titans &amp; Blightsteel from my Jhoira deck but I feel their synergy with this deck is ZERO so I haven't bothered. If you feel otherwise

*Elesh Norn* - I keep hearing how amazing this card is but friends keep saying it's garbage for my deck. I personally feel Elesh Norn would be fantastic for me as I have a lot of cheap creatures and most of the utility creatures in my play group are 2 or less toughness. Can someone explain why this creature is worth playing? More than any other creature on this list

*Akroma

*Angel of Serenity* - I keep hearing to play this over Elesh Norn. I can't deny the card reads amazing but it's more than 1/3rd of my budget and I feel I can get more value than just picking up Angel.

As for other cards...

*Restoration Angel* - Considering replacing Mystic Snake with this. Has a lot of synergy with the deck. Friends saying having the counterspell is more useful though. Very on the fence about this.

*Coiling Oracle* - I played it once. I don't dislike it but... what do I cut for it?

*Ixidron* - Something I saw on MTGSalvation. Seems powerful for the same reasons as Elesh Norn. I want to cut down on Wrath effects while still having answers to problems and perhaps this is good.

*Karmic Guide* - Feels like the best card I'm not playing but it's a $10 price point which is a chunk of my budget. Worth the investment?

*Gilded Drake* - Second best card I'm not playing it seems. It's about 1/3rd my budget but if it's THAT amazing

*Detention Sphere* - Seems like a no brainer but it eats up about $5~7. Is this a for sure in or is there something better?

*Bribery* - See Gilded Drake/Karmic Guide

*Wood Elves* - My mana base can best be described as ""Average"" or ""Mediocre"". . . this just makes things easier on me it seems. I don't see a reason to not run it...what would you cut though for it?

*Chromatic Lantern* - The Fix for my crappy mana base...

*Time Warp and other extra turn cards* - I have all of them from my Jhoira deck. I don't really feel they fit here too well as my Jhoira deck has ways to stack 3+ of these effortlessly giving me maximum value for them. I'd love to hear your experiences with these in this deck.

**My Manabase**

I know there will be people who suggest I get no new creatures/spells/artifacts/etc. and just focus on land. Is it worth it to spend most of my budget to just go for straight lands rather than power cards? I'd like to do a mix of both lands and other cards if I can help it.

Grixis presents a strong base to create a blink/ETB type of deck. Sedris lends himself mostly to this, Deadeye Navigator, Conjurer's Closet, and the various reanimation spells, it promises to be very strong, playing similarly to Riku, or Bant blink. These kinds of decks tend to be strong, and access to instant kill spells such as Comet Storm and Exsanguinate.

Alternitavely, Thraximundar, Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker, Price of Glory, Tectonic Instability, Pendrell Mists the list goes on and on. This would require a strong mana rock game, Mana Crypt

Or you could go for a control build. A focus on denying your opponents resources while capitalizing your own. Almost any of the legendary creatures could be used for this type of build, and decimate an opponents hand and life total. These decks will be very reactive, and will require you to prioritize your counter spells. It's an important skill for any blue player to learn what spells actually need countering. What hinders your game plan? What pushes your opponents closer to their win condition? As always, free counterspells are a massive source of value. Force of Will, Pact of Negation, Commandeer and many of their ilk will help you out. I'd also recommend counterspells that are hard to interact with. Time Stop is the ultimate no. Last Word and Counterflux have that beautiful line of text, ""Can't be countered."" Counterspells attached to creatures are also very difficult to deal with since there is no casting involved. Morph creatures such as Voidmage Prodigy and Voidmage Apprentice are great since morph doesn't even use the stack. Glen Elendra Archmage is persistent and forces everyone to think twice about what their playing. Deadeye again rears his head here

Any way you decide to build it, or success stories involving your decks. I may cover more color combinations in the future if discussions like this prove popular. Here from you all soon! and take care.

1365650981.0,1c42ld,[PRIMER]Borborgymos Enraged,petrcai,9,1,6,"This is my first time writing about EDH

**Introduction:**

[Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366283) is one of the most interesting generals around. It allows you to play a very different game

This build is for you if you:

* Enjoy complicated
* Enjoy table politic

This build is not for you if you:

* Enjoy casting creatures and attacking
* Enjoy having answers to everything
* Dislike fragile combo
 
[**Sample decklist**](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/edh-borborygmos-enraged-2/)

**The combo:**

* Step 1. get lands into play
* Step 2. get lands in play into your hand
* Step 3. use our general to kill the opponents

There are many ways to accomplish these 3 steps. 

**How to play this deck:**

* Avoid becoming the target at ALL COST. I can not stress how important this is. This deck will not survive the onslaught if it becomes the target. You have very little answers and very little ways to bounce back. This is where your political skills come into play. You need to constantly assess your perceived threat level and make plays accordingly. It's usually correct in the early game to try and balance the overall strength of your opponents so that they spend their resources fighting each other. Remember, or use [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202558) even if it means that you don't get the most value. You should try to feint weakness throughout the game. Sometimes it's best to not do anything even if you have a play. You should avoid making obviously powerful plays that does not cripple the opponents or win the game immediately. 

 
* In the early stage of the game, [Comet Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247539) and [Chain Reaction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247538) when necessary. And by necessary, I mean the last possible moment. There isn't a lot of answers in this deck, so you should try to get your opponents to answer the threat for you. Don't cast your wraths if there's a control player who just drew 5 cards.
* The middle stage is where proactive decks try to take over the game with overwhelming board presence and card advantage. Try to stop them when necessary, and their life total will often be very low by being the threat. Let these decks cripple or kill the control decks for us. Focus on setting up the combo in this stage. Find key cards with [Planar Portal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45486) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194972). Draw as many cards as possible. 

* The late game is where we kill! After we assemble the combo, sometimes it's OK to just go for it. It depends on the situation. Also, don't be lazy, do the math before you combo!

*  Step 2 and 3 of our combo should all happen in one turn. So cards like [Mana Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159264), in order to avoid sorcery speed answers from your opponents. There are a two ways to accomplish step 2: [Storm Cauldron] (http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25663), or [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111048) / [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593) + [Praetor's counsel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214034) / [Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245198). Don't forget to consider the damage from [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190400) if you are going off with [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593), and the 9 hasty attack if you are going off with [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=111048). Step 3 is to play our general and use the lands we get from step 2 to kill our opponents. The following cards can be used to effectively double the amount of ammo you have: [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205268), [Illusionist's Bracers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366426) and [Chandra, the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259205) -2, [Increasing Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262661) on [Praetor's counsel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214034) / [Creeping Renaissance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245198).

The Commander - Eight-and-a-Half Tails:

This guy is a total house.  You don't want to put him out onto the battlefield until you have the mana open to be able to protect him OR you want to get him out early before the other guys start drawing extra removal.  It's up to you and how you feel the game is going.  He is innocuous enough to avoid a lot of hate and his abilities make him resilient to all but the most determined of removal.  The big pillowfort enchantments and planeswalkers end up being surprisingly long lasting with your General blocking threats.  Feel free to ask specific questions on the interactions he has with just about anything that hits the stack.


Interesting cards and my thought process behind them:

[Palisade Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253567) - She's fantastic with my Eight-and-a-Half Tails (Especially against Voltron) and she's even better when I can tutor for Darksteel Plate

[Reverse the Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=79125) - This is a fantastic political card and

[Debt of Loyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4573) - The amount of wipes in my local meta is pretty heavy

[Sudden Disappearance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262865) + [Sundial of the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=228118) - These two cards are only in this deck specifically for the interaction they each have with the other.

I love the deck. It's everything broken I love doing in cube

What I don't like that Jenara is just an afterthought (a crazily threatening one though

I was hoping the community of /r/edh could point me to a general with a cool powerful engine that's not as generic as the goodstuff blink plan. I really enjoy working hard to put the engine together (see the future-sight-seedborn-flash hot mess above).
If there's some route to go down that features a lot of recursion while avoiding too much goodstuff

oh

tl;dr - i'm looking for a powerful engine that isn't infinite combo that people can interact with but at the same time will take over the game if left unchecked

1373974764.0,1ieocc,"Geth, Lord of the Vault",jollyfrog,8,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1ieocc/geth_lord_of_the_vault/

Hey all, but I think this one is alright. At the very least, I have won with it a lot, and each time was fun, interesting, and different. Just like I think EDH should be. 

The deck does trip over itself on occasion, but as per my group rule, no two card combos. 

The only other rule we have is no excessive tutoring. I try to limit all my black decks to just Demonic Tutor

Now

*Geth, Geth made me chuckle a little bit. I figured I'll use their graveyard as a resource too! It turns out I can also use Geth politically, helping an opponent that wants his graveyard full or helping the Mimeoplasm player get some extra fuel from across the entire table. 

One of the main ideas I had when I was building it was to not rely on my own graveyard too much, but It's mostly because of Mikaeus! Oh sweet lordy is Mikaeus one of my favorite Magic cards of all time. He is the centerpiece of a few combos, as well as just being awesome.

**Some of the combos**

To win the game, and any sacrifice outlet. Pretty common combo, but at least mildly hard to interrupt. Just ping everyone to death with a recurring Triskellion. On this note, I need more sac outlets. Alter of Dementia is good for what I'm going for, but I definitely need more. Suggestions?

INFINITE MANAZ
This one is a little silly
You need: 6 lands. Urborg, and three swamps/other lands. You also need Rings of Brighthearth. Pretty unlikely, but with infinite black mana, you can pretty much totally mill out an entire deck with Geth if it has enough creatures in it. Because of this combo, I took out Exsanguinate and Consume Spirit. It's just a really anti-climactic way to win. 

Now, and copying it with Vesuva and thespians stage makes for all that mana you should need for a turn.
Thinking of adding stuff like Crypt Ghast or Nirkana Revenant

So what are we going to do with all this mana? Well, steal things with Geth, blow up lands with Helldozer, repeatedly sack undying/persist creatures to get neat effects and suck off their counters with Hex Parasite.

For another combo


Things I want to do with this deck:
Add a discard sub-theme to help slow my opponents down. I don't know the best cards for this type of thing though.

Add more sac outlets. Creatures or artifacts

Add a few alternate win conditions

And finally

Let me know what you guys think. Thanks.

Who is the commander?  [Sliver Overlord](http://magiccards.info/pds/en/24.html) is my personal pick as he can tutor for the other legends

How about color split?  An even five color deck requires so much mana fixing that it will struggle to be consistent.  Green gets a lot of focus for being the mana fixing color.  How do you balance the deck?

Is being five color enough of a drawback to make slivers not OP

Do you play standard tribe support like Coat of Arms and Changelings

New Slivers vs old?  Does the ""All Slivers"" vs ""All Slivers you control"" mean an EDH deck should focus very heavily on new slivers to avoid mirror matches that give your opponent too much?

1373299285.0,1hvc2t,99 slots just isn't enough. I'd like some help choosing between some big scary creatures and all for my Olivia deck.,jollyfrog,9,2,20,"So

http://www.mtgdeckbuilder.net/Decks/ViewDeck/729487

I'll try to explain my card choices and what they are based upon, so that maybe you can come up with some good cards for specific situations. 

The decks I play against most often are:

*Super-Dredge Kerador
*Voroniclex
*Scion of the Mana Ramp into Scary Dragons
*The Mimeoplasm
*Skullbriar

And sometimes that angel lady that brings dragons and demons into play or whatever. I forget. He doesn't show up that often.

As a playgroup, but that said we wanna have fun too, and not all die to a turn 3 combo that kills everyone. It's an unwritten rule that our infinites should be minimal, and we should be able to see them coming to have a chance to stop them. 

What I want the deck to do is pretty obvious, but I don't find those so much fun so I may take them out.

I'd like to talk about my land base first. I tried to put in the best duals, I'm worried I don't have enough red sources to go without some of the other dual-lands. I need this deck to be fast to beat out Skullbriar (sort of ) and Scion. Once I get Olivia on board it seems to make others afraid to play their commanders, which is great. I think the best I can do is T1 land, sol ring, greaves, T2 land, Olivia, become public enemy #1. 

Apart from wanting a fast mana base, so I'm not too worried about going overboard with the extra mana effects. However, I'm not sure 37 is the right number. My logic is if all of them are producing extra, I'd certainly rather draw a spell than a land. But I'd also rather not have to mulligan a lot.

On to my Creatures. I pull my hair out trying to figure out the best stuff for this deck. It should absolutely be close to tribal, I may actually want to go up a few creatures, but I don't know what would be great versus just pretty okay. They definitely need to make an immediate impact. Some of my candidates for creatures slots are:
**Grave Titan**
*Poops out tokens
**Massacre Wurm**
*Talk about immediate impact when he hits the board! Not only that, -2/-2 doesn't seem to be a wipe in EDH. Maybe some mana dudes, but mehhh*
**Desecration Demon**
*I love the flavor of this guy
**Vampire Nighthawk** 
*I just can't cut another card it seems. I really think he should be in here though*
**Geth
*WOAH

Some creatures I'm contemplating trimming:
**Stuffy Doll**
*Basically the idea is to just have a way to directly assault a player with all that extra mana and Olivia. No way to choose a new player once the first one dies though
**Baron Sengir**
As awesome as he is
**Filth**
*Maybe if I ran stuff like Entomb, running both Blanket of Night and Urborg make him seem like a solid fit*
**Mirri the Cursed**
*One of my favorite vampires, and Nirkana Revenent, nothing to dump all my mana into.*

I'm sure I'm missing some great creatures or vampires

**SPELLS**
Keeping the X costing spells for sure. Profane command is one of my top 10 cards in the deck, lol!). My other slots are very much up fro fixing. Sorin's Vengeance seems fun, and works well with a lot of my big life drop cards, but in EDH, without the other pieces of a combo it's nearly useless. 

Looking through my deck makes me realize I'm silly for not including diabolic revalation
I've thought about beseech the queen

I tried to keep all my removal sacrifice effects, but I don't know what a good balance would be honestly. 

I haven't played magic enough to know about the best enchantments and artifacts, but that's kind of fun in itself. Plus, I'm running out of options for big mana.

Maybe I should have a lashwrithe or demonspine whip? Both seem good.

Azusa is probably my ideal general. A land ramp fatty aggressively costed card that screams ""build around my ability"". I never had the money to build an effective build, I decided to go all out and build my dream deck. 
 
Info on my meta, ranging from $2000 hermit druid t4 combo deck to your average ""play to have fun and try to win"" deck. I tend to find myself somewhere in the middle, attempting to be competitive while remaining on a much lower budget than many of my group members. As it is I'm more willing to spend on Azusa as she's my grad present to myself, so instead of the 1-2 $20 card limit I normally use, I'm willing to go into the 3-4 range, but card's like Gaea's Cradle are still out unfortunately. 

Now onto the deck itself. This deck is kind of your stereotypical Azusa build, enough to dump a massive amount of damage on board and draw enough of my deck to overrun my opponents. Drawing into Concordant Crossroads so I don't have to give my opponents a chance to respond to my sudden 140 damage on board has seemed pretty important in playtesting.

This is my first time making a mono red EDH deck. The main goal is to use [Jaya Ballard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234707) for value while making the game difficult for my opponents.

But the cards that Jaya uses are only a small portion of the list. I'm going to be completely honest and say that this deck is not perfectly tuned by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, some mana doublers, and some big flying creatures. Pretty much everything that I think red is great at doing.

I'm playing with a few ""win"" conditions, Word of Seizing, but I'm really not all that interested in winning. If they tuck my general, I'm okay with spending the rest of the game just doing silly things.

I don't really want to play a lot of counterspells or removal or things like that

Am I missing any cool interactions with my general? Are there other group hug cards I could put in to make other people explode more?

edit for help guidelines:

I want the deck to get people as much of their decks out as possible. Stuff like Temping Wurm and the blue Braids are what I'm shooting for. Mana doubling effects like Mana Flare, or anything like that is that kind of stuff I'm trying to play. Bonus points if it uses Ink-Treader. I'd like to have the option of stopping someone from going out of control without everyone else, which is why Mercy Killing is in there, but that's less of an issue. That's what everyone else at the table is for. I also like silly things I can do with Ink-Treader, like Illicit Auction or Polymorph.

For budget, but if it's fantastic or hilarious enough, it'd be worth it.

I come to you today with a predicament regarding my next EDH deck.

Just for some background on my playstyle and deck interest:  I currently play mono green omnath with a ton of ramp, or straight beats).  My interests lie with creatures, ramp and some control so omnath has been perfect.  I hate combo!


Now


My idea for the Jenara list is to make it a control she'll with some ramp and ETB creatures to abuse with venser and the like


The idea for Maelstrom Wanderer is a primal surge-esque deck with all permanants costing 7 or less, but ramp and fatties in this list seems like it could get redundant with my omnath list and pretty much end up being a ramp and fatty deck like omnath.


So which should I run?  Anyone with experience playing with or against either general

Keep in mind I've never actually played either deck

--------------

**[Wrexial](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/wrexial-wrecks-you/)**

The general idea of the deck is to use my opponents cards against them by cloning my opponents' creatures and using their spells against them. Wrexial obviously works best if my opponents' graveyards are full, I play some mill cards, I tried not to play ""one-shot-effects"", but couldn't resist putting in Traumatize. As always with a blue deck, I was tempted to jam it full to the brim with counters, but I know my friends wouldn't enjoy that, so the only counters are ones that fit the theme of the deck.

My main concern about this deck is the relatively high mana curve, Ambassador Laquatus etc. ? But all those effects seem so small.

----------------

**[Vish Kal](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/vish-kal-wishes-you-dead/)**

The theme here is playing creatures with sweet ETB effects and being able to recur them. I am not sure how feasible this is

My main conern however is the correct ratio of etb-creature
As with the other deck
I also think this deck might have a little too much removal

There was a post a while ago about other cards that would serve as good Commanders but as I'm writing this I can't think of too many.

Some areas I'd like to see explored/focused on:

1. Effects/Interactions with the command zone: Your creatures get +1/+1 while he's in the command zone

2. ""Negative"" effects like Abyssal Persecutor

3. Cards that refer to Allies like Imperial Mask

4. More political orientated cards: Making players choose

5. More variety in some colour combinations: Ruric Thar and Bory 2.0 are good examples of this for Gruul. I think they feel flavourful without being just a beatdown commander.

Rules: 1.33 non-land cards from either ravnica or RTR block (nonbasic land doesnt count). 
2. Must use a general from one of the guilds
3. Deck must follow multiplayer edh rules in terms of banlist.

My favorite guild is Simic, although vorel is a close second and deserves a slot in the deck even not being at the helm. 

This is what I came up with http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/counter-speaker-zegana/ 

The deck is supposed to play to abuse Prime Speaker's ability, and generally taking advantage of the multitude of counters and card advantage generated to win. Psychosis Crawler with Prime Speaker has been an all star, and Primordial hydra (if left alone for even a turn) becomes a massive threat and draw generator. 

Now here's the problem, but I'm at a loss for what to remove for them. Any input on what I should drop or change to make that magic 33, or swaps of one ravnica card for another would be great. Thanks a lot!
