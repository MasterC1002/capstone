1376406570.0,1ka4yz,Let's make a timeline!,ZackOFFICIAL,78,6,44,"With all these clone theories, and the five seasons definitely haven't taken place over ten years

So here's what I know:

* **1900** Guild Flashback (thanks /u/radjose)

* **1910** Founding of the Guild of Calamitous Intent

* **1959** Rad Mantle and Dragoon join the guild. (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1961-1968** The Monarch is born. *(note 1)*

* **1964/1965** Rusty is born *(note 2)*

* **1968** Spanakopita takes place

* **1969** Major Tom dies

* **1969-1976** The Monarch's parents are killed in a plane crash.

* **1972/1973** Billy Quizboy is born (16 or 17 years old in 1989)

* **1976** Venturion is constructed

* **1977** Venturion Decommissioned 

* **1978/1979** M.U.T.H.E.R. floods Jonas's underground utopia with a neurotoxin. The children touring are abandoned inside. (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1979** Venturion returns as Vendata

* **1979/1980** Nikki Fictel Born (15 in 1995)

* **1982/1983**  Rusty begins college. *(note 2)*

* **1986** Brock attends Goodwill games (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1987** Sphinx is defeated by OSI

* **1988-1989** Rusty loses his virginity at the age of 24

* **1989** Billy Quizboy recruited by attends State. Phantom Limb becomes a full fledged villain in the Guild. The boys are likely conceived early in this year and born shortly before November

* **1993** The Boys believe they are born *(see edit 2)*

* **1995** Dermott is born

* **2004** Crime o Dile dies

* **2011** End of Season 4

* **2012** End of Season 5


**Notes**: 

1. The monarch was eight when his parents died
Since I don't have every date reference/timeline hint memorized

2. Mike was inspired to study robotics after seeing Bladerunner


EDIT: Formatting

EDIT 2: Hank and Dean were born before the fall of the Berlin wall (before billy was recruited by the OSI) and Dean states he's 18 in ""The Devi's Grip."" As such, since they'd believe they were born in 1993. If Dermott is still 17 at the end of Season 5 his birth date is 1995, and Nikki's would be around 1979.

A-plot, no confirmation if Myra is the boys' mother. Damn you writers!)

B-plot

C-plot, so I expect we'll see that addressed more in the upcoming season

1376156827.0,1k3jyj,A list of unanswered questions (up to the end of Season 5),smallflightlessbird,48,5,75,"Just finished watching the whole show again

**1. Why does the Monarch hate Dr Venture?**

Monarch's ""first attempt to destroy Venture"" was in college. The event which first triggered the Monarch's hatred can't have happened much earlier than that

Edit: I also forgot to mention that there are a ton of hints that Rusty and the Monarch are actually related to each other

Edit: In S05E07, he seems to be hallucinating: ""Where is my wife? [...] I think the plane is going down."" Is Vendata the Monarch's father?

**2. Who is Hank and Dean's mother?**

We now know for sure that Myra is not their mom. I can't think of too many other remaining female characters who would be about the right age, but we don't know who with. Could this woman be connected to the Monarch somehow?

""Dean
- Ben

**3. How did Jonas Venture die?**

Through the latter part of the ORB episode, ""I have taken from this world a great man; my silence is my penance."" But he was silent as Rusty's bodyguard long before Jonas had died. This episode also implies that even Brock doesn't know exactly how Jonas died.

One other thing to note is that when the alien impersonates Jonas at the end of ""Twenty Years to Midnight""

**4. Who killed 24?**

At the end of the Season 5 finale, but the trigger was left behind on one of the thrones.

**5. Who is the sovereign

(Credit to [crypticthree](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cbl2c77).) ""We now know that the sovereign is a shape shifter

Edit: As pointed out by [tibbytime](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cblr7wq), I think it's highly unlikely.""

**6. Who is Rusty's mom?**

(Credit to [aeomatic](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cbl37p4).) This has been addressed much

Most of these points come from the Halloween special where it was said that Jonas helped in the perfecting of the process. There's also people saying that Rusty couldn't have built the facility because he's incompetent. And this discussion is starting up again because of the reveal that the Monarch and Rusty knew each other in some capacity as children. I don't see how Rusty could be a clone since it showed that he swallowed J.J. in vitro and J.J. has been gestating there until a couple of years ago. Consider Jonas Venture Sr.: adventurer, has inadequacy issues. He couldn't save his kids every time like his father did for him. Not to mention how dim they were in the beginning seasons. I think the combination of Rusty being an alright kid to begin with, just lazy. As for the Monarch

Nowadays he makes things like that crappy vacuum and generally doesn't try anymore.

I still kinda wish he went the route of a villain, hell bent on destruction, mutating angry insectoid woman, general impressive weaponry.

**Bonus Edit Question**: I was watching some old episode and getting myself back into the series.

Rusty wasn't too worried about the boys lives because he has replacements.

However

""Tears!? Come on! You know that sick deformed freak! You know he was pounding his invisible meat!"" - the Monarch

Plus the fact that we see the Alchemist pick something up

So this all implies that after the accident that destroyed his machine, or was this merely a little extra self esteem boost? Can he kill with it?

In Pomp and Circuitry it is revealed to us that Phantom Limb can control his appendages when they're not attached to him (that is what happened right? He used his invisible detached limbs to move his inanimate object friends?) What does this mean for the alchemist? Did Phantom Limb at some point summon his penis, inch-worming its way over streets and through rivers, possible in the cold or the rain, until they were reunited? Did he try to exact any revenge on the alchemist? Did poor Al get chased around his apartment by a killer invisible penis? If he can control his detached limbs, can he also feel them? Did Al attempt any racy activities with the poor little guy?

And now we've seen that Phantom Limb, by the help of Dr. Impossible. Were they regenerated or reattached? Has his penis been regenerated as well? Is it still trapped in Al's apartment (or he lives with Dr. Orpheus now?) Is the Phantom Limb we know and love still a eunuch?
These are the questions that keep me up at night.

1. 21 is going to find out that the monarch killed 24 (see the shallow gravy ep for the monarch's confession) and now he has left the monarch will either arch him or try to kill him.  His romantic interest with Dr. Girlfriend will feature in this too. (edit: don't forget the monarch added his name to 21's list.  He goes back to get his stuff.. and then what?)

2. We will see more of ben and find out that Dr. venture is a clone, and ben thinking it odd rusty never mentioned him) I think these were deliberate hints of that.

3.  We'll see more of ""new hank"" and new dean.  I know that's kinda obvious

1) Why didn't Jonas manually override or reprogram Muther once he was back topside?  He just unplugged her and left her programming in state.

2) Why was MUTHER programmed to launch all her nukes if Dr. Venture is not present?  What kind of insane idea is that?

Sgt Hatred: went from bad guy to archenemy to body guard to growing tits.
Hank &amp; Dean: innocent young adventurers, no longer ""immortal"", Hank ""almost"" sphinx, ""almost"" OSI and always batman, Dean struggling with self awareness and rebellious ""goth"" or ""emo"" young scientist.
Henchman 21: Fat, looses best friend, struggles with ghost of dead friend, gets buff, becomes ruthless top henchman, has a breakdown, leaves the monarch, sphinx dismantles

1.What is your name and what do you do?

Christopher McCulloch, direct and produce. Doc Hammer also writes scripts for the show.

2.How did you come up with the idea of Venture Brothers?

There wasn't really any specific moment of inspiration, if I'm not mistaken)--they were just two idiot kids who talked like Scooby Doo or Leave it to Beaver characters and maybe solved adventures. I was looking at a lot of old boys' adventure novels from the 1950's &amp; 60's at the time--stuff like Tom Swift--and I was just goofing on that and my vague memories of the old Jonny Quest cartoons. I tucked them away in my notebook and would think about them little by little over the following years, eventually adding their father and Brock to the cast as I moved the idea closer to a parody of Jonny Quest. Basically I'd start by subverting the expectations of any character you'd find in a straight adventure cartoon from that time period. Slowly the characters developed their own personalities separate from the direct parody I was perpetrating. Eventually, after several years of not really developing them full time, I had enough scattered notes and concepts to try to write a comic book story about them. I publish an anthology of underground comics called Monkeysuit with some friends of mine. But at that time it had been so long since I'd drawn any comics that I didn't think my artistic skills were up to snuff to really do the story justice the way I saw it in my head, so I held off for another year and kept adding more and more notes to my notebook.  The next time we were gettting ready to publish an issue of Monkeysuit my art had improved but my story was now too long for the ten or twelve pages I'd been assigned.  So I started another story...and that one got too long, too.  Now I had a folder of sketches, so I cobbled it all together into what would become the pilot episode script of The Venture  Bros. cartoon.

3.What was the most enjoyable part of this season of Venture Brothers?

I assume you mean the most enjoyable part of the process of making the show, yelling in character and developing jokes and dialogue.  That's the point when you're just doing it because it's fun and because your mind's racing, so it's purely creative with no restrictions, no expectations, and really no effort.  When you actually have to turn it into a script, it becomes work--you have to make the story make sense, you have to keep it to a specific time, etc.  But writing's still fun and enjoyable...there's just a little more pressure there.  The same goes for all phases of production, but it's also a drag because it's a time consuming process and you can't help but feel a little depressed about it because it's the last time you'll ever get to touch it--your last chance to make it what you want to be and you're already stuck with whatever animation you got back from Korea.  

4.How many voices do you do for the show roughly?

I do two of the main characters: Hank Venture and The Monarch.  I also do Pete White (who sounds like my dad) and one of the Monarch's henchmen (who sounds like Ray Romano) who both show up pretty frequently. We have a lot of characters who only show up in one or two episodes but have big parts and I did some of those: Roy Brisby, doctors, henchmen, etc.--who only have one or two lines and I do a lot of those voices, too.

5.Are any of the characters refrences to any other cartoons or movies?

A lot of them are.  Heck, as I like to see them, homages) to the Six Million Dollar Man, Walt Disney, The Right Stuff, John Woo movies, Fargo, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and dozens of others. Not to mention passing references to real world rock stars and toys and games and books.  We even got to actually use Race Bannon from the Jonny Quest cartoons (because Cartoon Network owns those).  We killed him

6.When and What is Venture Brothers on?

The Venture Bros. is on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block of programming.  It's on Saturday nights at 11:30pm and Monday through Wednesday nights at midnight.

to their cloning). Add
	
**""The Incredible Mr. Brisby""**

-Mr. Brisby
	Question: How was Brisby aware of this information even if the O.S.I. was not at this point?   
-This is the first mention of the cloning technology.  

**""Powerless in the Face of Death""** 

-It is revealed that the boys are clones and have died 15 times before
-The learning beds record their memories and put them into their cloned bodies. 
-Brock has been aware of the cloning for some time.
-They come out pink
-Orpheus becomes aware that they are clones.

**""The Buddy System""**

-Rusty clones a child at his day camp and removes the cancer from his DNA: ""they'll thank me after they re-potty-train him"".
-Questionable: Supposedly the child would have no past memories due to the recorded memories not supplied.  

**""The Family That Slays Together Stays Together Part I""** 

-Hank tells Le Tueur that he once dressed up like Batman and jumped off the roof but thinks it might have been a dream. The death montage in ""Powerless in the Face of Death"" shows it did happen.
-Therefore

**""The Family That Slays Together Stays Together Part II/ Blood of the Father
(adding these together for the sake of saving room)

-During an O.S.I vs Monarch battle the clone slugs are released to fight
-Because of the battle many more people request/ demand their own clones: Gary wanting a clone of 24
-The O.S.I.

**""Perchance to Dean""**

-A flash-back shows a deformed Dean clone being aborted. Therefore some times the clones will not be 100% perfect but will have some mutations. 
-Also
-The clone was able to survive for a long period of time on its own. 

**""The Better Man""**

-The Master is aware that Dean is a clone

**""The Diving Bell Vs. The Butter-Glider""**

-While in Dr. Venture they see the corpses of the 7th Hank and Dean. 

**""A Very Venture Halloween""**

-Dean meets Ben and learns that he has been cloned multiple times. 
-Ben has worked with Jonas Sr
-Ben says to an upset Dean that ""Jonas, saw it as nothing more than a fucking band-aid for a really big boo-boo."" 
-Jonas must have performed some type of trial
-Ben also says that Dean has a real mother: he was the result of ""getting drunk and forgetting to wear a condom
-Reco/ Rico= Recombinant Lusus Naturae. Recombinant DNA: DNA sequences that result from the use of laboratory methods (molecular cloning) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, or monster.

**""Mama's Boys""**

-The boys learn that Myra is not their real mother

**""The Devil's Grip""**

-Dean tells Hank that they are both clones. Hanks reacts very well to the news and sees himself as the Highlander

In summation
At this point we cannot be completely certain that any other characters are clones (Rusty
we can really only make guesses and theories. Jonas and Ben have most likely created a clone based on Ben saying that they both have ""perfected genetic engineering"" and saw it as a ""band-aid""
has been supplied. There are still a few questions: the vague memories of their deaths
