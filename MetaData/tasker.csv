1351629048.0,12cv57,Thanks to Tasker,jrmwz,215,30,13,"Last night the brunt of hurricane Sandy passed overhead.  The sump pump in my basement was running continuously and after watching the water levels with the pump disabled I figured I'd have about ten minutes to start my generator and get the pump back online before the sump filled with water.  I was running on fumes and with no way of knowing whether the power was out if I fell asleep I set up a super-simple Tasker profile to raise an alarm if the phone was not on a/c power.

Around 5:30am this morning the alarm went off without a hitch as the power failed.  It did end up coming back on minutes later

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/EnDNEYm.png)

The ""Turn off"" button turns off Wi-Fi immediately while the ""Cancel"" button stops the countdown process and lets you keep Wi-Fi on, notification is dismissed and a new notification message shows ""Wi-Fi reconnected!"" and disappears immediately. If a Wi-Fi connection is not regained in 60 seconds, Wi-Fi is turned off, the notification is dismissed, and a new notification message is displayed: ""You left Wi-Fi on, idiot"". Note: the profile considers the case where Wi-Fi is initially turned on and always begins as disconnected; the notification will not show until AFTER disconnecting from an already established connection.

Changeable things:


* Timeout - To change the timeout, i.e., converting ""90 seconds"" to display as ""1:30"").
* Notification message after countdown finishes - Default is ""You left Wi-Fi on

1370652057.0,1fweb1,[How To] Connect to wolfram alpha via API to pull important event anniversaries for today and displays them on a minimalistic text widget every day,PinkyThePig,64,7,14,"So let me start this post by first [directing you to my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1fbmxm/how_tomaking_api_calls_to_wolfram_alpha/) about Wolfram Alpha if you do not know how to get connected to their API.

With that out of the way what follows is my Tasker task and associated things and afterwards will be a largeish explanation. In addition you may notice there are a handful of 'extra' steps. I tend to add those in to make everything more user friendly and if I ever decide to I can start using Tasker App Factory on them with as few modifications as possible.

Make a profile that runs at 1am. (From 01:00 To 01:00) Have that profile run this task.

1. If &gt; %Wolfapi ! Set
2. Variable Query &gt; Title: Wolfram API &gt; Variable: %Wolfapi &gt; Default: Please insert API Key &gt; Timeout: 525 seconds
3. End If
4. If &gt; %Wolfapi ~ Please insert API Key
5. Variable Clear &gt; Variable %Wolfapi
6. Goto &gt; Type: Action Number &gt; Number: 1
7. End If
8. HTTP Get &gt; Server:Port: http://api.wolframalpha.com &gt; Path: v2/query?input=%DATE&amp;appid=%Wolfapi&amp;podstate=NotableEventForDate\_\_Show anniversaries&amp;podstate=NotableEventForDate\_\_More&amp;includepodid=NotableEventForDate &gt; Timeout: 20 &gt; Mime Type: text/xml __(IMPORTANT: There is a space between ""Show"" and ""anniversaries"")__
9. Variable Set &gt; %Wolfraw to %HTTPD
10. Variable Split &gt; %Wolfraw &gt; Splitter: &lt;plaintext&gt;
11. Variable Split &gt; %Wolfraw2 &gt; Splitter: &lt;/plaintext&gt;
12. Variable Set &gt; %Wolfans to %Wolfraw21
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: \&amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '
14. Minimalistic Text &gt; Configuration: Wolftxt1 = %Wolfans

After that make a Minimalistic Text widget 4x2. Add a single Locale Variable. Name said variable Wolftxt1. From here everything else is optional but you can change font size etc to your liking. I then use widget locker to add minimalistic text to [my lock screen](http://imgur.com/2g54JPr.jpg).

Now for the explanation. Lines 1-7 are basically fluff. They are completely optional as you can always manually add said variable in the variable listing in Tasker.

So Line 8 deserves its own paragraph. It took much reading through their [API document](http://products.wolframalpha.com/docs/WolframAlpha-API-Reference.pdf) to get this pulled perfectly. The relevant 'options' podstate and includepodid are referenced on 14 and 23 respectively. Podstate achieves the same thing as clicking 'more' in the top right of a 'pod' and having it in there twice is the equivalent of clicking said more button two times. Includepodid makes it so that ONLY the anniversary values are pulled. So instead of getting a pod containing phases of the moon or holidays I ONLY receive the anniversaries pod. One other note about said action is debugging the text in this field was probably half of my time spent on this project. 1 Typo? Not so bad. 2 Typos? This is getting annoying. 3 Typos? WTF do you mean I forgot to include a space! ARGGGGGGG!!! I had 3 typos that took me probably an hour to find in the monster block of text. End my suffering

Lines 9-12 are just pulling the text from the XML response returned. In the future I may add error messages in here if say wolfram isn't reachable or if there is a bad API key etc.

Line 13 is needed (and more may be needed) as when wolfram returns data with an apostrophe in it it actually sends \&amp;apos; instead of an actual apostrophe.

Line 14 displays the actual events for that day. Conveniently wolfram sends them with an 'enter' at the end of each line so no splitting or further manipulating of the data is needed for it to display well.

Enjoy!

Edit: Fixed apos at end.

Edit2: [Here is an xml dump if you wanted to import.](http://pastebin.com/eA4ZdxG8)

EDIT3: Fixed my code. Line 13 is now:  
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: \&amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '  
instead of:  
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: &amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '

    “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear

Tools: Tasker

1. Find the programs you use that cause wakelocks. Use whatever app to identify the wakelocks. I use BetterBatteryStats. For me it was Google Maps


2. Create the primary Task that will shutdown these apps when screen is off in Tasker:

Context: Display State ON (invert) 
Task: Disable Apps - Google Current


3. Now


Task: Enable App - Google Maps (Use Secure Settings Package State).
Task: Launch App - Google Maps.


4. Export the Task by creating an APP using Tasker App Factory. 


5. Install APK of your new Task.


6. Done. Enjoy greater battery life by getting rid of those wakelocks.

Here is my list (from a thread yesterday) of most of the things I use Tasker for. If anyone wants profile details just ask!

   1. Long press search (new feature) pops up a menu with my top used apps and I have one of the icons represent a task which opens a menu of my top used tasks. Allows me to toggle wifi/bluetooth/gps or run any of my tasks WHILE another program is active.
   2. Bluetooth turns off 15 seconds after bluetooth disconnect with notification announcing this.
   3. When battery level &lt;15% turn off wireless
   4. During 11PM to 7AM turn off wifi
   5. Turn on GPS when My Tracks
   6. When Phone Offhook (calling someone) set variable %OFFHOOK 1 when Phone Idle clear %OFFHOOK (so I can check for this to stop some profiles from running while on phone)
   7. When I unlock my phone write the time and battery level to file. (To observe how compulsively I check my phone.)
   8. When I leave my home location start a popup asking if I want to set variable %CARMODE
   9. When %CARMODE is set: Read texts
   10. Display rotation off for certain apps.
   11. Hourly chime and 30 minute gong. Set brightness to 0 hourly (since Touchwiz notification swipe changes brightness w/ Galaxy S)
   12. Use a Cell Near profile to set variable %NEARHOME and another profile uses a Wifi Near profile which checks only when %NEARHOME is set (prevents turning on wifi near far from home).
   13. Bluetooth widget which toggles bluetooth and sets widget icon based on state.
   14. Widget to turn on my computer using the Wake On Lan locale plugin when I am connected to home wifi.
   15. Widget to take a picture using the camera. (saves time from having to open the app
   16. Every 15 minutes: Menu task asks if I have been on task or not. Depending on answer it opens another menu task of productive/distracting tasks I routinely do. Sound also plays Mario Death = off task Level complete = on task. Finally all this information is put into a text file.
   17. Set up desktop notifications of phone calls
   18. Use a Task countdown widget to track cooking time or any other eggtimer task. The task I attach it to simply raises the media volume

Protip #1: When creating a menu to select Apps or a Task

Protip #2: Often

It was actually surprisingly easy (took 10 minutes tops to get back a resultant text file) but there is apparently quite a lot of stuff that gets returned and was wondering if anyone was wanting to take this further as I personally don't have a use for it at this time but it would be interesting to see where it goes. Here's the basics.

1. You need to set up an API account at wolfram alpha. Super simple

2. Generate an API key. This should be a long string of gibberish.

3. Make a task that does an HTTP Get to:  
http://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query?input=%INPUT&amp;appid=[Insert_your_app_ID_here] &gt; Mime Type: text/xml &gt; Output File: outputdump.txt


The Variable %INPUT controls what question you ask wolfram. Make sure that when you set the variable the spaces

That's it! You now have a huge amount of text to wade thru and variable split

Bonus Round: There is significantly more functionality available such as setting assumptions (which narrows your results) which starts on page 7 of their API document. So if you only plan to use wolfram for a very specific task you would probably want to add that in to your query.",self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1fbmxm/how_tomaking_api_calls_to_wolfram_alpha/

This one is a little tricky but here is what you are going to need.

1. Chrome (OS or Browser)
2. Tasker (duh ;P)
3. PHP server (apache
4. Internet connection.

Alright. First start off by creating a new profile.
Select *""Event &gt;Phone &gt; Received Text""* You can then fill it in with whom ever you wish to receive notifications for or leave blank for all texts.

Next you are going to want to create a new task.
Select *""Net &gt; HTTP Post""* This is where you are going to fill in all the info for your server

**msg=$SMSRB**


Be sure to save all this.

Now let's focus on the PHP side of things. 
Grab [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui7egrgym4zozxi/SMS.php?m) file.

(You can rename it. Just make sure it's a .php file)

Now you need to place it on your website and go back to Tasker and make sure to fill in the *Server and Port* correctly.

Now in in order for Chrome to display all this you are going to need a few more files.

1372834005.0,1hjx4m,"[Partial How To] Home automation with tasker, push notifications to android, and a doorbell that shows you who is knocking!",PinkyThePig,33,6

My final goal for all of this is to have a raspberry pi, it is just there to pull more use out of the pi for other things. (Maybe even a speaker to tell them to come in or access denied!)

The way it would work is upon pressing the doorbell it sends a notification to my android which initiates a popup with a picture of the person ringing the doorbell with an option to do nothing / unlock the door / retake the picture. So far I have the notification part taken care of

The more indepth explanation for this portion is that upon someone pressing the doorbell the pi would initiate a python script which sends a notification to my android via NMA. Tasker then automatically takes that notification and does something.

Links:  
Library for sending push notification: https://github.com/uskr/pynma  
Notify my Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usk.app.notifymyandroid  
Tasker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm  
You would need to install the python library from git into the same folder where your script is stored (other possiblities for this but this will do for now) via:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    (cd to your desired directory for installing all of this)
    git clone http://github.com/uskr/pynma.git

This will make a directory inside that folder starting with pynma. You will want to make your python script inside the first pynma folder where test.py is.

With this portion installed quickly switch over to your android phone and get NMA and make an account. On the website www.notifymyandroid.com you will want to login to your account and generate an API key. We will need it in a few seconds.

Then we want to switch back to the pi and create this python script:

~~from pynma import PyNMA~~

    import pynma
    doorapi = pynma.PyNMA( ""insert your api key here"" )
    doorapi.push(""Door"", ""/picture/of/person/ringing/door.jpg"")

The first 3 fields on the last line are the different fields that display on the push. The 4th is a URL. Can make an actual URL to allow tapping of push to open your browser

Now switch back to the phone and in tasker we want to make a new profile with Event &gt; System &gt; Intent Received and in the action field fill in: com.usk.app.notifymyandroid.NEW_NOTIFICATION

leave all else default.
Make a new task called NMA

Now from this task the possibilities are endless. You can reference all of the push fields via: %app (field 1), %url (field 4), %prio (priority, unused in my example).

From here if you wanted to allow your phone to react to multiple things such as doorbell or a security alarm tripped you would want to make multiple If/End If under the task such as

    If: %app ~ Door  
    &gt;Do stuff here  
    &gt;Stop  
    End If  
    If: %app ~ Security  
    &gt;Do stuff here  
    &gt;Stop  
    End If  

That is as far as I have gotten so far. The button I have mostly figured out

1300889319.0,g9pje,A trick I've learned in programming classes...,gerusz,32,8,4,"Hey

Maybe some of you have encountered the following problem: you have multiple profiles that can set the phone to silent mode and turn the ringer back on in their exit actions, you have separate calendars for lectures and seminars, they overlap and the ringer turns back on when you have your seminar.

There is a solution: semaphores.

So how did I set up these profiles?

First

Then I have a profile with the condition ""Variable value %SEMA Math:Greater than 0"". The enter task is ""Silent mode: Vibrate""

And whenever I want a profile to silence the phone then turn the sound back on in the exit task, the semaphore-checking profile does it for them.

Of course, but I have only set it up for the silent mode since that's the only profile where I have overlapping profiles.

I hope some of you will find it useful.",self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/g9pje/a_trick_ive_learned_in_programming_classes/

If Bluetooth (insert MAC address here) is connected

This fires up a task called 'new text BT'.



**New Text BT**

1. Start Autovoice Continuous (I want it to start before I need to speak so it's up and running in time)

2. Say 'One New Text Message'

3. wait 10 seconds

4. AutoVoice Continuous Stop

First off, it fires up another task called Read Newest Text.

**Read Newest Text**

1. Say 'SMS From %SMSRN (This is the name of the person who sent the most recent text) %SMSRB (This is the body of the most recent text). '

2. Say 'Would you like to reply?'

3. Get Voice (with a timeout of 10 seconds).

4. IF %VOICE = yes (for some reason

Get Voice takes whatever you say and saves it as a variable named %VOICE. This makes it easy to us the IF command that's found in many actions.

**Respond to text**

1. Say 'Please speak your response'

2.Get Voice 30 seconds

3. Variable Set %HeardSMS to %VOICE - This takes whatever is in %VOICE and saves it to a new variable called %HeardSMS. This is important so that if %VOICE gets overwritten you don't lose the message you just spoke

4. Say 'Send Message %HeardSMS (body of the text) to %SMSRN (the name of the sender of the last received text)?

5. Get Voice with a timeout of 10 seconds

6. Send SMS %HeardSMS to %SMSRN **ONLY IF** %VOICE = yes (this is why it was important to save the text body as %HeardSMS)

7. Clear the variable %VOICE (probably not necessary

8. Say 'Did you want to edit or cancel?' **ONLY IF** %VOICE doesn't equal 'yes'

9. Get Voice for 10 seconds

10. Stop Task IF %VOICE = cancel

11. Go to Action 1 (beginning of this task) if %VOICE = edit

12. Go to Action 8 (ask if you want to edit or cancel) if %VOICE doesn't equal 'edit' or 'cancel'

Specifically about variables..,RedemptionX11,26,2,11,"First off I just want to say that Tasker has blown me away with its abilities. Now, etc. I'm the type of learner that needs more than just a text telling me something

I think I get the basic concept of variables..Like Receiving a text is an event, is it as simple as typing in %unknownnumber as a variable? Or is there some certain way I'm supposed to write it so Tasker knows what I mean?     

There is a variable for receiving emails and the like
     - Going a little further on this one, I would need to split the Gmail variable I mentioned before so it would be different for each account, correct? How would I do that?     
Also

I also see that you can assign values to variables. All I've gathered from that is that a value =1 means the variable is ""true"" and value=0 means ""untrue""... or something like that. Is that correct?    

Now.. What are ""Arrays"" and how are they used? Again

My last question (for the moment) is what exactly do the ""tasks"" actions do and what do they mean? It seems pretty obvious what 'stop' does (stops the context?) but the rest I don't get. Anchor, end if, for, goto, if, return, wait... I just keep shaking my head at these and how useless they currently are to me because I can't figure out what exactly they do and how to incorporate them into a profile.   


That's all for now. Thanks in advance!

This is specifically set up for music playing through Google Play Music App. Pandora and Amazon MP3 ~~aren't controllable via the media control actions so I couldn't add them in~~ are tricky to control with Play Music on the system.

The project only runs when Play Music is on or recently turned off and as such is designed to always be enabled. That said

Controls:

- 1 wave will play or pause and say the correct term ""play"" or ""pause""
- 2 waves plays the next track and says ""next""
- 3 waves plays the previous track and say ""previous""
- 4 or more waves acts as a cancel and says the number of waves you did

* Uploads files in the /sdcard/dropbox folder that you specify (I may later support files not in that folder

* Supports Tasker variable substitution (So you can upload files with the date in their name

* Uses the real Dropbox API

* It actually works. I played with a few things on the market before

* Only uploads when you tell it to - it doesn't make a background service that wastes battery.

* Again

Also, recursively upload all files in that directory. Would you guys be interested in that feature?

For instance: I want my Nexus 4 to disable wifi when I leave the house


Tools Needed: Backup tool like Carbon, but DataSync doesn't have one way Sync, and it has seriously messed me up in the past - AVOID at all costs). 

1. You need to identify each device as unique

1.a - Declare Variable: DeviceModelID
1.b - Create a new Profile:

Profile: ""Screen On""
State: Device Screen ON
Task: Set Variable 'DeviceModelID' to %DEVTID

The above sets the Device ID that is unique. Look at your DeviceModelID variable

Once complete

2. You need to create a profile for your device that you can re-use over and over

Profile: Nexus 4
State: Variable DeviceModelID matches value ""32323232"" (This is the value set in stage one)
Task: STOP (command STOP)

3. Done. You can now do all your Tasker related activities on your primary device


Now

Say I want to create a new Context for Wifi to turn off when you leave the house:


Profile: Disable Wifi
State: %PACTIVE = ""Nexus 4""
Task: wifi off


The above will turn off wifi on my Nexus 4 only. This way you can manage multiple devices from One device.

* The first stage with screen on is required; the reason for this is that the variable was set on your primary device as 32323232 - when you go to restore on your secondary device

I love Tasker. Every week, or just more interesting. Currently, I'm building a sort of 'virtual assistant' around a complex set of tasks, but I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

My calendar is a huge part of the way I use my phone. I have a schedule that varies from day to day

My first grand plan for my assistant is, along with some context-sensitive chatter;

""Good morning Mr. chrispy212. Looks like a busy one today, and the last is with Dr. Thompson at 4.00pm.""

However, you can HTTP GET your calendar feed from Google, but it's far from ideal, especially considering there are some pretty powerful Calendar API's on Android. 

I want to change that. Tasker's plugin architecture is powerful enough for me to create a plugin that lets the average user query all the calendars on their device - not just GCal but Exchange and others too - and return the results in variables for them to do whatever with.

First off, and for someone to tell me how, with as few expletives as possible.

Failing that

Step 1: Create a profile. When you add a profile, and received text. For type, you can choose any (thats what I choose) or change it to SMS/MMS. Aside from that, leave everything else blank

Step 2: Create a new task from the new profile. Name it text alert. 

Step 3: Add a new action. Click on Audio. Click on media volume. Change the  level to a volume thats loud enough to hear for when your in your car (your phone will raise the volume to this level when its going to say the new text message). Click on the sound checkbox and exit the task

Step 4: Create a second new action. Click task, exit the second action. We will go back later and change the number ""1"" to ""4"", but since we don't have a 4th action, it won't allow us to do it yet. 

Step 5: create a third action. Click on Miscellaneous. Click GPS. Under Set

Step 6: Create a 4th action. Click on Miscellaneous. Click on Get Location. Make sure the source is on GPS and the timeout is 100 seconds. Click on ""Continue task immediately"" (under my observation

Step 7: Go back to step 4 and change the action number type to 4 (as explained before). After that

Step 8: create a 5th action. Click task. Click perform task. In the name section type ""Convert_LOCSPD_MPH"" (type this with exact caps and underscores. The only thing that isn't supposed to be typed are the quotation marks). Set the priority to 5. Exit the 5th action. Exit out of text alert.

Step 9: You should be on the profiles section now. Create a second task within your ""Recieved Text any *, type ""%LOCSPD*2.23693629"". Click the check box on ""Do maths"" and exit the action. Exit out of ""Convert_LOCSPD_MPH"" to get back to the profile screen. (Its almost complete, I promise)

Step 10: Click back into your ""text alert"" task to create one last action (action #6). Click on Miscellaneous. Click on Say. in the text section type:

 ""%SMSRN sent the following message: %SMSRB"" 

(use the exact caps lock and percent sign). in the engine: voice section, click on ""Maths: Greater than"". On the right side, type in ""5"". Exit the task.

 If you want to allow it also to send a message back to the contact saying that ""I am busy driving right now and will message back later""

Step 11: to auto send a message back to who sent you the message

 ""(auto) I am currently driving (at %LOCSPDMPH MPH). Will respond to you when I can safely."" 

the ""%LOCSPDMPH MPH"" will show the contact how fast you are driving.

Step 1-3 are pretty obvious how they work. Step 4 explains that if the GPS is already on, the phone learns to speak the new message.

Step 11 explained how the message can be sent out to the contacts who sent you the message. on the bottom, the ""If"" statement is the same as step 10 and can be changed to any speed you want.

- Really cheap

- works with a lot of different hardware from a lot of different manufacturers

- allows 3rd party apps

- those 3rd party apps have tasker plugins

- you can control everything with your phone or pc (native clients for linux

- system can be easily retrofitted into every home

- Very easy to setup

- Haven't found any yet.

I come home - scan a nfc tag, etc. and boots my pc. If it's between 4pm and 7am the lights turn on as well.

I leave the house - all the lights turn off

1356658253.0,15jrwz,[How To] Implement a Smarter Silent Profile at Night,Meta8,21,3,9,"Hey guys!

This is my first real profile I've implemented all by myself on Tasker. The goal is to automatically set the phone to silent at night at home. However, after which it switches to Silent. Once the user uses the phone again (or it's morning come), the phone goes back to whatever setting it had before.

Here's how I did it:
(Also let me know if it can be improved)

1 - Create the first profile (call it e.g. ""Silent at night"") with the following:

* Context 1: From 23:00 till 07:00 (or whatever your sleep time is)
* Context 2: Wi-Fi connected to home network (if you'd like this to take effect only at home)
* Context 3: Variable Value %ISIDLE
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Silent""
    * Silent Mode On

2 - Create the second profile (call it e.g. ""Monitor idle"") with the following:

* Context: Display Off (in the Event section)
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Set Idle"" with the following actions:
    * Variable Set %ISWAITING to 1
    * Wait 5 mins (or however long you'd like the 'timeout' to be)
    * Variable Set %ISIDLE to 1 If %ISWAITING = 1
    * Variable Clear %ISWAITING

3 - Create the third profile (call it e.g. ""Clear waiting and idle"") with the following:

* Context: Display On (in the Event section)
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Clear Waiting &amp; Idle"" with the following actions:
    * Variable Clear %ISWAITING
    * Variable Clear %ISIDLE

Now, and set Collision Handling to ""Abort Existing Task"". This will allow Tasker to count a new set of 5 minutes if you turn on the screen during the previous 5 minutes.

Earlier tonight I rememberd that Nova could do homescreen gesture recognition and at the same time I was using my phone to listen to music and wasn't having fun opening poweramp just to skip the track forward. Enter tasker!

By setting up the tasks to skip back, rotate clockwise, and double tap, respectively, I can now control poweramp from the homescreen. here are the tasks:

    Media Next (96)
    	A1: Media Control [ Cmd:Next Simulate Media Button:On ] 
    
    Media Previous (108)

    Media Pause (104)
    	A1: Media Control [ Cmd:Toggle Pause Simulate Media Button:On ] 

That's three tasks, pick the gesture you want to use and tap it, then go to shortcuts, scroll all the way down and select task cut (it has the tasker icon) and make a new task with the media action you so desire. Done!

The next section is a bit more advanced and contains one task and two profiles.  It also isn't fully tested yet as I came up with it shortly after the above tasks. What it does is allow you to setup a nova gesture to turn the screen off, then turn itself back off. You can continue to wave your hand over the phone until you manually turn the screen off with the power button. This is handy when your phone is doing stuff but it's just sitting on your desk and you don't want to leave the screen on. I set the pinch in gesture to turn the screen off because it's kind of intuitive :)

Note that under the tasker settings you will have to enable the proximity sensor to be polled when the screen is off. This under the 'Monitor' tab in settings.

1373319036.0,1hw38i,Howto: Use Tasker to make your phone's auto-rotation less sensitive,kindall,19,3,4,"**Edited** 7/12/13 to remove requirement that accelerometer be turned on in Tasker prefs; this isn't actually necessary.

It's nice that my phone display can auto-rotate

Tasker to the rescue... believe it or not!

**Method A** (the best way)

Requires:

* Tasker (of course)
* A ROM that lets you choose what orientations your phone's display can auto-rotate into. I use Carbon

Steps:

1. Go into your phone's orientation settings and TURN OFF everything but 90 degrees. Don't worry
2. At the bottom of Tasker &gt; Preferences &gt; Monitor, make sure Beginner Mode (in the UI tab of the Tasker prefs) is not set.
3. Now create a profile: Name: Landscape; Contexts: [State: Display On; State: Orientation Left Side]. Create a new Enter task containing one action: Display Rotation On.
4. Create a second profile: Name: Portrait; Contexts: [State: Display On; State: Orientation Standing Up]. Create a new Enter task containing one action: Display Rotation Off.
5. Set the Restore Settings checkbox in both of these profiles to Off. (Long-press the profile name
6. Optionally, if you want to force portrait mode at either of these occasions.

Now your phone won't auto-rotate into landscape until you hold it pretty much exactly in landscape orientation

If you want to, it should be difficult to switch accidentally since they are physically so far apart.

**Method B**

If you're not running a ROM that lets you disable some screen orientations for whatever reason (e.g. don't want to root) then you can use Tasker with one of the following apps from the Play Store.

* [Rotation Locker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devasque.rotationlocker&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5kZXZhc3F1ZS5yb3RhdGlvbmxvY2tlciJd) - free
* [Ultimate Rotation Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.fameit.rotate&amp;feature=search_result) - $2.99 with 7-day trial

Ultimate Rotation Control has more orientations than Rotation Locker (it supports reverse portrait and reverse landscape). Both have Tasker plug-ins so you can easily set up profiles to rotate the screen

The downside of these is that they *force* rotation. Even if an app is set not to rotate (e.g. some launchers have a preference for this)

The profiles you'll need for a basic implementation are the same as above

**Power Usage**

The orientation sensor is basically passive (powered by gravity) and Tasker's use of it uses no more power than the OS's use of it for automatic display rotation. I certainly haven't noticed any additional power consumption since adding these profiles to my Tasker setup.

Assume you create a task called ""volume off"" which turns the volume down to 0 for notifications, etc.

Now you want to utilize ""volume off"" so you create a profile called ""sleepy time"" which runs from 10pm - 7am.

Once you have selected the time frame(10pm-7am)

Instead

Next click in the ""+"" and select ""Task --&gt; Preform Task"". From the list you can now have it run ""volume off"". This is great

You can have it run as many ""Preform Tasks"" as you want. So you could create a ""volumn off"" and a ""disable sync"" and a ""copy pictures to remote server"" etc and have it all called in 1 profile.

Doing it this way allows you to create a lot of common reusable task and you can string them together in different ways for different profiles.

So in CyanogenMod 7, you can create a shortcut on the dock or on one of your desktops to call the ""Start Assist"" task.  
What all the above code gives you is a way to call apps and functions using a single word. When the ""Get Command"" task is called, which is why I push it into %VOICECMD).  
The ""Assist Action"" task should have a list of the things you want to happen based on what you say. For example

---
1: Load App: WSDOT; If: %VOICECMD ~ pass  
2: Load App: Navigation; If: %VOICECMD ~ navigation  
3: Load App: Music Mod; If: %VOICECMD ~ music  
4: Load App: Waze; If: %VOICECMD ~ ways   (had to tweak this one)

Notice that the word is all lowercase as that is what is returned from Get Voice. Now, and say ""navigation"" and immediately the navigation app is loaded. ~~Multiple word actions are possible by increasing the Maximum Results slider on the Get Voice function.~~ You can use multiple word actions with the setup detailed above. So, for example:  

5: Load App: GasBuddy; If: %VOICECMD ~ find gas

Hope this helps to fuel some imagination in your Tasker profiles. I will be doing more in the future
Thanks for reading!

I've found this: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/12754/how-can-i-enable-mobile-data-periodically-with-tasker

But at one point I can't combine the conditions into one profile.
It's that one:

&gt; * **Time: Repeat 15min**
&gt; * **State -&gt; Variable Value %LCD ~ 0**
&gt; * **State -&gt; Variable Value %PSAFE ~ 1**
&gt;
&gt;So it runs all 15min
&gt;
&gt; * Net -&gt; Mobile Data: ON
&gt; * Net -&gt; Auto Sync: ON
&gt; * Tasker -&gt; Wait: 1min
&gt; * Net -&gt; Auto Sync: OFF
&gt; * Net -&gt; Mobile Data: OFF

I'm only able to say every 10 minutes but I can't check the display status. 
That's only possible at the tasks.

1362724944.0,19wecm,[HOW TO] Show battery drain/hr + time to 0% / time to 100%(while plugged in),E_x_Lnc,18,3,5,"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1523053

&gt;4 Profiles Total:
&gt;Profile 1 - OnBoot - Clears and sets variables for new battery drain/charge stats

&gt;Profile 2 - PluggedIn (AC or USB) - Clears and sets variables for new battery drain/charge stats

&gt;Profile 3 - BattCharging - Calculates %charge/hr

&gt;Profile 4 - BattDraining - Calculates %drain/hr
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The first two profiles are designed to clear and reset the battery% and timestart variables when the phone boots up or when the power profile changes. The first one is the OnBoot profile which is a useful profile to have in the first place. You can have your phone start a program or do some other useful task when your phone first starts up.
&gt;
&gt;The second one will activate when the phone is plugged in either via usb or the wall plug. This is also a useful profile for other reasons... for example you can make your timeout longer when the phone is plugged in and make it go back to a shorter timeout when it's unplugged with the exit task.
&gt;
&gt;I would imagine some people already have an OnBoot and a Charging profile
&gt;
&gt;Profile 1: OnBoot
&gt;Context: Event &gt; System &gt; Device Boot
&gt;Task:

&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...
&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)

&gt;5. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTDRAIN = Please

&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...

&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)
&gt;
&gt;Exit Task:

&gt;1. Variable Clear: %BATTSTART

&gt;2. Variable Clear: %TIMESTART

&gt;3. Variable Set: %BATTSTART To %BATT

&gt;4. Variable Set: %TIMESTART To %TIMES

&gt;5. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTDRAIN = Please

&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...

&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)
&gt;
&gt;The next two profiles are where all the math is done. One profile is setup for when the phone is plugged in and charging. The other is setup for when the phone is unplugged and discharging. An IF statement was implemented because Tasker seems to track battery changes very frequently even when the actual battery percent hasn't changed. So a variable called %BATTPREV was created to do a quick check... If the battery % hasn't changed then it doesn't do anything until it does change. Also... I personally have the results written to a battlog.txt file because I found it handy to see a log of data.
&gt;
&gt;I used the Variable Section task to drop one of the decimal points... Precision to 3 decimals is not necessary I don't feel

This was great and all

Using [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) I am not able to enable the doubletap to wake my phone ONLY while my phone is docked!!!

**Buy and Install**

* Buy and Install [PGM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ponury.pgm2)  ($3.08)
* Buy and Install [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) ($6.49) (or from the [Tasker homepage](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/index.html) for cheaper)

**Setup PGM**

* Run PGM and make sure the **Load and Start at boot are on and checked**

**Setup Tasker to Enable PGM on docking**

* Open Tasker.
* In Tasker's Profiles tab click the ""+"" icon and name your profile something like ""Tap screen to unlock""
* Next select either ""State &gt; Power &gt; Power"" or ""State &gt; Hardware &gt; Docked"" depending if your using a dock or just a USB cable for your dock.
* Hit The Green Check mark to save your condition.
* On the next screen Scroll to the top and choose ""New Task"". Name it ""Enable PGM"" or something more clever and tap the green check mark.
* Click the ""+"" and choose ""Script &gt; Run Shell""
* In the Command field type ""echo enabled 1 &gt; /proc/ponury/g_doubletap2wake"" and check the Use Root option. Then hit the green check mark.
* Tap the green check mark again.

**Setup Tasker to Disable PGM on undocking**

* You should see your profile named  ""Tap screen to unlock"" in the profiles tab. Below it should be your condition and your command ""Enable PGM""
* Long press on the command ""Enable PGM"" and choose ""Add Exit Task""
* Scroll up to the top and choose ""New Task"". Name it something like ""Disable PGM"" and click the green check mark.
* Click the ""+"" and choose ""Script &gt; Run Shell""
* In the Command field type ""echo enabled 0 &gt; /proc/ponury/g_doubletap2wake"" and check the Use Root option. Then hit the green check mark.
* Tap the green check mark again.
* Tap the green check mark again

I hope someone finds this useful. I am very excited to have this functionality built into my phone. Android for Life! :)

**TL;DR: Want to double tap your screen to turn the screen on while your phone is docked.

Sleep Mode Project:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/106730378/Sleep_Mode.prj.xml


This is what it does:

**Normal Mode:**

* Alarm clock that goes off at 7AM M-F
and tells me the date and the weather in my city (San Diego).

* Received Texts

**Sleep Mode Widget:**

* Records the time I pushed it for the sleep timer to announce later

* Turns off my normal text alert

* Sets media volume to 0 (I choose to use media volume for most of my tasker notifications just because it works best for me)

* Turns on my Sleep Text Alert which is silent and sends an automatic
response saying I am asleep and how long I've been sleeping. This
includes instructions that if they send another text including the
word ""emergency"" or ""911"" it will wake me up. It then announces that I have received an emergency text from the sender to wake me up on the ringer channel

**Driving Mode Widget:**

* Records the time I started Driving to send drive time later.

* Sets my media volume to Max.

* Announces &amp; starts playing music.

* Turns off regular text mode and puts into Driving Text Received Mode

* Texts received while driving pause my music


If you want to install this import the projects and change the Task&gt;Sleep Widget/Driving Widget&gt;Set Widget Icons to your own icons, delete the icon changing actions, or download the same icon pack. Then place the Tasker Widget ""Task"" and set the task to ""Sleep Widget"" or ""Driving Widget"" and you should be good to go.


Also, and Asleep when you are asleep, not vice versa.


The weather announce alarm is basically a copy of the "" WEATHER - Speak Weather in the Morning"" profile on the official Tasker Wiki and the toggle widgets are the ""Generic Toggle Widget"" from wiki as well


**Known Problems so far:**

* I haven't found a good way to get the ""Get Voice"" action to work when the screen is off

* Texts that are supposed to be automatically responded to are sometimes received more than once. I added a 1 second delay to the start of the profile and a 5 second wait before repeating the text received profile, and would rather not have a 1 second delay if it can be avoided. If you have issues with receiving texts multiple times, try messing with a wait time before repeating or executing the profile.

* Music playback when entering driving mode doesn't always work

* I am assuming you will run into problems if both widgets are active at the same time(Driving widget set to driving and Sleep widget set to asleep). There is an easy work around by having each profile check the variable the other sets


These profiles are running on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.

This essay is brought to you by a programmer who wants to explain some programming concepts that make Tasker a lot more powerful for non-programmers. It will be long. Let's start

**First of all: Tasker condition types.**

Tasker has two condition types: states and events. Events are one-shot... well... events, screen on, etc...

A state condition, more on that later). It can only have two actions: an enter and an exit action. However, a profile can have a technically infinite amount of state conditions. Examples: location, time, calendar event, etc...

**Conversion between condition types**

Sometimes

**Creating a custom state**

Luckily, a variable must be initialized to be used. In the following example, I'm going to create the ""screen on"" state.

Create a task (say ""InitVar"") that has - currently - one action: set the %DISPLAY variable to 0. Yes, or it will set the variable as a string instead of a number! Whenever you create a new variable, add such a similar action to the ""InitVar"". Press the play button in the bottom right corner to initialize this variable now - you don't want to reboot your phone for this to work, do you? Now create a profile that has a single condition: ""Device Boot"". Its action should be the InitVar task.

Next

First, the value to 1 and check ""Do Maths"" for the same reason as in InitVar.

Can you guess what ""DisplayOff"" will do? Yup, only the value should be 0.

From now on, build a talking clock that says the time only when the screen is off, you can add a new state condition: Variable / Variable value. The comparison should be ""Math: equals"", the parameter should be 1.

**Creating a custom event**

States already have two events: a ""phone entered state"" event and a ""phone exited state"" event. You can only assign one task to each. This is the problem here

Because you can launch tasks from other tasks.

Yes

**One way to make a logical OR: locks.**

Now you can make a new state. That's great. However, so there is some overlap between them. You have set up two profiles that silence the phone when you have events in these calendars. However, thanks to the overlap the ""unsilence"" runs when the seminar ended and you are already sitting in the lecture. You want a profile that silences the phone when you have an event in either the ""Seminars"" OR the ""Lectures"" calendar.

Tasker, so that's what I'll call them.

First, you'll have 0 and greater-than-0 values. The point is: every time your phone enters a state in which it should be silent, it adds one to the variable and every time it exits from a state like that, it subtracts one. When the variable is 0, the phone isn't in any of the states. When it's greater than 0, it's in one of those states, so it will be silent.

How?

Well, ""Silence"" and ""Unsilence"".

Silence will - surprise - turn silent mode on. Unsilence will turn it off. These are the simple tasks. Making tasks like this is the first thing everyone does with Tasker

Now the increment and the decrement. SilentLockIncrement should add one to %SILENTLOCK so you'll have to use Variable / Variable Add.

SilentLockDecrement should subtract one from %SILENTLOCK

Then you should make a profile that actually changes the setting depending on the value of the lock. The condition should be Variable / Variable value. The variable should be %SILENTLOCK, 2 to 3, 128 to 127, etc..., it won't do anything since it's still greater than 0. So the enter task should be Silence and the exit task Unsilence.

Now if you want to add any other silence condition (location, instead of silencing the phone directly, you should use SilentLockIncrease and SilentLockDecrease.

**The other way: De Morgan's laws.**

Okay

Yup

Wait

[De Morgan's laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) are:

""The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations."" and

""The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.""

WTF?

OK

NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B) and

NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B).

So how does it help in creating a logical OR? You see

But we want to have an OR

Woah

Instead of creating the new variable, with Google:Seminars and the Invert also checked. You will enter this state when you have neither lectures, nor seminars. So ""Unsilence"" should be the enter condition instead of the exit condition and ""Silence"" should be the exit condition! Brilliant, isn't it?

Good luck with the profiles!

**Philosophical musings about the nature of Tasker states**

I've said that a state is actually a set of states. What did I mean with that? Well, etc... of the phone - the battery state, the volume, the reception, the variables you set, etc...

A Tasker state is actually a set of states that match the condition you set. For example

This has no effect on your usual Tasker-usage however,False,self,t5_2s0ro,True,,,t3_m934i

That last bit is whenever someone sends me a text that is two or more texts long.  In those situations

----

**Profile:** When any text from anyone is received

**Texter:**

* Secure Settings(used to turn screen on when receiving a text)
* Variable Set: %Sender to %SMSRF(sets my own variable to the sender.  Used my own to reduce the overall number of tasks I needed to make)
* Perform Task: AutoReply

**AutoReply:**

* Variable Set: %Message to ""[Automated]...""  **IF** %Endo/%CalEvent/%Night is set(Three nearly identical steps that only change what %Message is set to
* Stop **IF** %Message is not set.
* Send SMS to %Sender body is %Message  **IF** %Sender is set
* Send SMS to %Caller body is %Message **IF** %Caller is set(I have another task for missed calls).
* Variable Clear: %Caller

----

So that works most the time except for the longer texts that end up with my [Automated] messages sending multiple times.  I'm trying to come up with an elegant way to resolve that issue with as few tasks as possible.

My idea on that is to set another variable at the end of the AutoReply task and make it equal to %Sender(before it's cleared out).  From there I could check in the beginning of the task if %Sender = %SenderPrevious and stop if it does that.  I would then have another profile that waits for %SenderPrevious to be set

* [Secure Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin&amp;hl=en)
* A second launcher of your choice (I used [ssLauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.launcher&amp;hl=en))
* You must be rooted

**Setting up Secure Settings**
Secure Settings is a plugin for Tasker that gives you control over a whole bunch of phone settings. Once you've installed it open its icon. Slide over to the options page and under ""root actions"" make sure that Package Manager is enabled.

**Getting Ready For Launcher Swaping**
As I said, Android will not allow any third party to change your default launcher setting. It will always ask the user which launcher you want to use until the user specifies which launcher gets the default ""chip"". However, if the phone has only one available launcher to choose from, Android will automatically use that launcher regardless of weather or not that launcher has been specified as the default, without a prompt.
To exploit this

* go to system settings &gt; apps
* find the launcher you're currently using (for me this is nova launcher)
* open it and scroll down to the ""Clear defaults"" button and press it
* Press your home button

**Disableing stock launchers**
You must make sure that you have exactly 2 launchers available to Android. Since both the launchers I want to use (Nova Launcher, or you already have only 2 launchers installed you can skip this step.

* open Tasker
* in the ""Tasks"" tab
* Name it ""Stock Launcher disable"" (dosen't really matter)
* Add an action: Plugin &gt; Secure Settings
* click the edit button next to ""configuration""
* pick ""Package Manager"" under root actions
* click the question mark in the top left and scroll and select your stock launcher (trebuchet
* once selected make sure that the grey toggle in the middle is set to ""disabled""
* press the save button in the bottom left
* press the test/play button on the bottom right hand side. This will disable your stock launcher

**Using Tasker to automate the swap**
This is the easiest part of the whole enterprise. 

* In Tasker
* in your entry task add a new action: Plugin &gt; secure settings
* edit the plugin configuration: Edit &gt; Package Manager
* select your alternative launcher (sslauncher in my case)
* Set the grey toggle to ""enable""
* hit save in the bottom left
Now for your exit task do the exact same except make sure the toggle is set to disable your launcher rather than enable it. 

And you're done! You can test your entry and exit tasks

*quick note* wallpaper is shared between launchers. this can cause problems when you want one launcher to have one bg,,False,self,t5_2s0ro,False,,True

Prerequisites: Rooted Device, [Car Home Ultra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spinninghead.carhome&amp;feature=related_apps), and [4.2 Car Mode Patch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spinninghead.homepatch#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwic3Bpbm5pbmdoZWFkLmhvbWVwYXRjaCJd)(by the same developer as Car Home Ultra).

1. Open up Tasker and create a new Profile. I named mine ""Car Home""
2. Your Context might vary but I have this profile activate when my phone's state is plugged in and it's connected to my car stereos Bluetooth.
3. Create the entry task. I named mine ""Car Home On""
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;(Your default launcher here. Mine was ADW) - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;System Launcher - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;CarMode Bug Fix Home - Enabled
 * New Action&gt;Display&gt;Car Mode&gt;Set On and Go Home (Car Home Ultra has an option for this but I think Tasker handles it much faster)
 * Press the play button on the bottom of the Task Edit window to test the new task. Exit Car Mode and return to Tasker. If everything worked right save the task.
4. Add an exit task. I named mine ""Car Home Off""
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;CarMode Bug Fix Home - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;(Your Launcher here) - Enabled (I chose to leave the system launcher disabled)
 * New Action&gt;Display&gt;Car Mode&gt; Set Off
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Launch Activity&gt;(Your Launcher Here)
 * New Action&gt;App&gt;Kill App&gt;CarHome Ultra
6. Save the Car Mode Off task and re-open the entry task. 
 * Press play again to start car mode and make sure the home button takes you to Car Home Ultra. 
 * If everything is working use the recent application button to re-open tasker without getting out of car mode or exiting Car Home Ultra.
 * Now press the play button on the exit task to make sure car mode is turned off and that your default launcher is now re-associated with the home button.

If everything worked then you now have a working car mode once again! I had to kind of figure this stuff out through several different posts at [this thread](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?can=2&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;q=&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars&amp;groupby=&amp;sort=&amp;id=39662) and some trial and error.

1351287521.0,1258px,[How To] More advanced Location SMS Auto-Reply,cubanjew,18,5,9,"**What this does:** 

Automatically replies to an SMS containing *""where are you""* with your location + Google Maps link.

There's a similar Tasker profile out there

This can be much more useful in situations like when your bar buddies ask you what bar you're at - the name of the bar is so much more useful than the address (especially in college towns where there's 10+ bars on a street)

Here's an overview of the procedural flow of this profile:

1. Queries Google Places API to get the name of the food/store/gas station/establishment you are at (uses the GPS accuracy as the search radius).
1. If no establishment is found within your GPS accuracy radius
1. Automatically replies with your location in the following format:

 	*[NAME/ADDRESS]*
 
 	*[Google Maps Shortened Link]*
 
 	*[Location accuracy] [Your speed]*


**Examples:**	

[Screen capture example](http://i.imgur.com/RtSLj.png)

(If Google API was able to identify establishment name):


&gt;Paddy's Irish Pub
&gt;
&gt;http://goo.gl/abCd
&gt;
&gt;(+/- 6m



(Otherwise):	

&gt;123 Fake Street

&gt;FakeCity

&gt;http://goo.gl/abCd

&gt;(+/- 6m


   
         

**Requirements:**

In order to use Google's API for determining the the name of the store/establishment you're at (not address)

1. Visit [Google API Services] (https://code.google.com/apis/console/#access) and generate an API key.
1. Go to the [Services](https://code.google.com/apis/console/#services) tab and enable access to ""Places API.""

**Installation:**

1. [Download](http://zomgstuff.net/tasker/Location_SMS_Auto_Reply.prf.xml) the profile and &amp; import it into Tasker
1. In the Tasks tab
1. Open up the second task item (""Variable Set"") and edit the ""To"" value to your Google API Key


**Room for Improvement:**

* Restrict auto-reply to phone #'s in your contacts list by comparing ""Text From"" and ""Text From Name"" phone # variables or by creating a whitelist array
* Change the *""send sms message""* to* ""compose sms message""* if you want to confirm whether or not to send your location


**Privacy:** 

Google's URL shortener only accepts JSON encoded POST requests rather than GET requests. I couldn't find any documentation on how to do this with Tasker so I created a script hosted on my website that acts as the middleman to get around this. 
The script does the following:

* Takes your lattitude/longitude as a HTTP GET request from your phone
* Executes a HTTP JSON-encoded POST request to Google API
* Echos the results back to Tasker on your phone

None of your information is stored but if you don't feel comfortable you are free to download and host the [script](http://pastebin.com/SJuY6BuF) yourself.

I'd love to hear any feedback on my first Tasker profile


**----------Edit:----------**

My website is no longer up and I've received several PMs asking for the files. Here are the links &amp; instructions for getting this working again:

&gt;1) **Download Profile:** [Location_SMS_Auto_Reply.prf.xml](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yjgNiBPV)

&gt;
&gt;2) Since I don't have my website up anymore you'll have to find a place to host this [script](http://pastebin.com/SJuY6BuF) (there's tons of free services)

&gt;3) In the profile xml file you downloaded

&gt;Change the web address to reflect where you're hosting the php file from #2. (**don't** change the  *""?url=%LOC""* part though).

**Profile 1: Car tunes**

*The premise of this one is simple. ICS/JB ROMs for my phone set the Media volume at 6 or 7 when you plug a 3.5mm cord in, then down two. Figured Tasker could help, and I was right.*

Condition: Headset Plugged

Task 1: Open PlayerPro

Task 2: Set Media Volume ""13"" (out of 15)

*Works just how I like. I get in my car, and my volume is set. I could have Tasker pick my master playlist when I make it, but it's easy enough to choose and sometimes I'm in the mood for something specific.*

**Profile 2: Bluetooth on

This one's a straight up battery saver. I use a Bluetooh ear piece

Condition: Call incoming (any)

Task 1: Bluetooth on

Task 2: Bluetooth to phone audio (connects to earpiece)

End task: Bluetooth off

So This is going to be a very long post. Just a heads up.

All of this shows you how to print pretty much any file (text or image) on your thermal printer from your phone.

This will be broken up in to 3 parts. First will be the initial setup

Here is a picture album with the referenced pictures for this project as well as some test prints: [http://imgur.com/a/FGHB5](http://imgur.com/a/FGHB5)

First for the parts list:  
Raspberry Pi: 35$  
SD Card for RaspPi: 10$  
[Thermal Printer \(and needed assesories\)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/600): 62$  
[Two Pin headers &amp; Two Jumpers](http://i.imgur.com/VhK2L3Y.jpg): &lt;1$ (pennies / free?)  
Some solder: 2$ if you don't have any  
Soldering iron: 10$ for an el cheapo one

Tasker: 4$  
FolderSync: 3$  
AutoShare: ~1$  
SSH Command for Tasker: 1.50$

Total Cost: ~ 120 (shipping may add to this number)

First you will need a raspberry pi computer as well as a thermal printer. You will want to follow the setup listed in [adafruit's internet of things](http://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer) regarding the software install and follow my hook up pictures [here](http://i.imgur.com/YKPpjnd.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/RnEHack.jpg).

At this point make sure you can print test pictures from their library and dont forget to run calibrate.py and change the corresponding Adafruit_thermal.py heat setting so that your images print correctly.

If everything up to this point is successful you should have a fully functioning printer.

(**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you are using a different non root user from the default pi user in which it prompts for a password when running commands as sudo then you will need to either add your user to root or do some other workaround so that it will not prompt for the password as that will break the SSH Command functionality in tasker. There are multiple ways to do this ranging from making your user account a root user to making a shell script that auto runs as root.)

Now for the second part:

This section will be going over how to print text files. The way mine is setup is to tie in to other tasks as I don't currently have a reason to directly print text from outside of tasker.

First

    from __future__ import print_function
    from Adafruit_Thermal import *
    printer = Adafruit_Thermal(""/dev/ttyAMAO""
    f = open('/insert/your/directory/here/Android/print.txt'
    printer.print(f.read())
    f.close()
    printer.feed(3)

With the script installed we can now go back to the phone and add in our tasker task. I recommend making a folder somewhere to save your text file in.

    1. Write File &gt; File: tasker pi/print.txt &gt; Text: %Printtxt
    2. Folder Sync &gt; Config: Pi Printer #Explained after
    3. Wait &gt; 10 Seconds
    4. SSH Command &gt; sudo python /insert/your/directory/here/piprinter.py

For Folder Sync in accounts select SFTP and input the credentials for SSHing into your pi. For Folder Pair select /insert/your/directory/here/Android for the remote folder and the folder where you are saving your text file as the local folder. Set sync type: to remote folder. Check instant sync and set overwrite old files always and conflicting modifications to use local file. Then select this folder pair inside your tasker task.

Now to print anything from another task you will want to set what needs printing to %Printtxt and call this task. This completes the text printing tutorial.

Now moving on to the image printing tutorial. One thing to note here is that for your purposes you may not need autoshare. Autoshare is just needed so that you can browse the gallery on your phone and print directly from there. If you have another task that creates an image and you only want to print that same image name over and over you shouldn't need autoshare. On to the tutorial!

First

    from __future__ import print_function
    import PIL
    from Adafruit_Thermal import *
    from PIL import Image
    img = Image.open(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/androidpicture.png"")
    basewidth = 360
    wpercent = (basewidth/float(img.size[0]))
    hsize = int((float(img.size[1])*float(wpercent)))
    img = img.resize((basewdith
    img = img.convert('1')
    img.save(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/processedimg.bmp"")
    
    printer = Adafruit_Thermal(""/dev/ttyAMAO""
    printer.printImage(Image.open(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/processedimg.bmp""))
    printer.feed(3)

That completes the script. It saves the final image as a reference so if the printer is acting up you can make sure that you are sending a valid bitmap file. Now for the tasker task.

    Make a profile that is State &gt; Plugin &gt; Sender: com.sec.android.gallery3d
    Task it links to is named Print Image
    1. Load Image &gt; Source %asfile1
    2. Save Image &gt; Tasker Pi Img/androidpicture.png
    3. Folder Sync &gt; Config: Tasker Image
    4. Wait &gt; 10 seconds
    5. SSH Command sudo python /insert/your/directory/here/imgpiprinter.py

For the folder sync on this set up everything the same just swapping out for the picture directories. For the profile you would want to change/add senders for each program you want to print from. I only currently intend to print from my gallery app so that is all that I added. To actually print tap the share icon and then tap autoshare.

With this you can now print all sorts of things from your phone! Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions or if you see any typos.

This profile can be used to work with any app that is able to share text that you want to keep track of. Also

**Setup Dropsync**

If you haven't already, it should take you through the setup of choosing the folder to sync. You can change sync settings depending on your preference.

**Tasker profile**

Before starting with Tasker

Now, subject, and text should all populate. With the free version, only the text will populate.

You can change the text filter how you like, you could filter by #SoundHound and it should work, but I haven't tested this.

In the task, so I used a Script &gt; Javascriptlet action to split out the parts I didn't want with the following code:

    var song1 = astext.split('found ');

    var newsong = song2[0];

This stores the song name and artist in the variable %newsong. If you are using a different app to share

**Basic Steps**:

1.   Create a new action in Tasker.

As a result, using the regular alarm system is very cumbersome, especially if I end up falling asleep without intending to. I also am starting to miss classes.

* Figure out what time I slept based on inactivity periods. I usually look at my phone one last time before I sleep,+5 mins or so.)

* Check my schedule. This is my major issue with it. I can get it to see whether I have something on my schedule right now, and Location of a current event (as a built-in variable), but I can't figure out how to tell when the next event starts. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.

* Attempt to give me as many 90-minute sleep cycles as possible, then give me 30 minutes or so to get out of bed and get to campus with an extra 30 minutes for shower if I slept more than 4.5 hours, or if I did not go home the day before for more than 20 minutes.

* How can I get the time of the next event?
* How can I do time-based calculations?
* Can I interface directly with the phone alarm (I am on 4.2 Gnex), before the actual alarm sounds.)

1373129694.0,1hr6vz,[How To: Update] How to do my thermal printer task from SL4A for improved printing time.,PinkyThePig,13,3,0,"This is an update to my [Thermal Printer project](http://redd.it/1halfm). I was never happy with the plugins that I used as FolderSync would randomly take longer than 10 seconds and it would do nothing at all if another sync was happening at the same time and SSH Command only let me use a single server which meant I could either print things from home while on wifi or print things from 4g but not both. I had since then tried all sorts of other plugins over the last few days and all of them seemed to have similar problems. At this point I found Better Terminal Emulator Pro which had scp and ssh built in

**NOTE: This script requires root on your phone to get around a bug that would otherwise happen with the known_hosts file.**

Required Apps:
SL4A: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/  

Better Terminal Emulator Pro ($4): http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro

First you need to generate an RSA/DSS key for your raspberry pi. Do this via BTEP. Can just google ""dropbear making RSA key"" there are a couple of different ways to do it. You also want to copy the public key to your raspberry pi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

From here you will want to make this shell script inside SL4A:

    su -c /data/data/com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro/bin/scp -i /path/to/rsa/key/rsa_key /path/to/picture/on/phone/androidpicture.png piusername@192.168.1.10:/path/to/picture/on/raspberrypi/androidpicture.png
    su -c /data/data/com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro/bin/ssh 192.168.1.10 -i /path/to/rsa/key/rsa_key -l piusername sudo python /path/to/your/python/script/imgpiprint.py
    exit

The advantages of using this script over my previous setup is:

1. It is always going to work
2. It is significantly faster. The task now takes 2-4 seconds as compared to the 15-20 previously.
3. You will no longer run into the issue of the sync taking longer than the wait timer and as a result it prints the old image. With both commands in the same script it waits for the first to finish before starting the second.

When you go to add this to your task you will want to select the gear icon instead of black box so that it will not popup on your screen and instead will run in the background.

EDIT: I forgot to also add there is an update to the python script for printing. This is option but it basically makes every picture that prints from the printer print in its largest way (eg. instead of scaling to print an inch high

put these lines after the image.open line but before the wpercent line:

    if img.size[1] &lt; img.size[0]:
        img2 = img.rotate(270)

When unlocked

I set my wallpaper with Nova Launcher. It sets it correctly using the portrait option.

Unfortunately, not the portrait crop that nova launcher is using. 

Usually with Tasker, it doesn't' seem to work that with display unlocked. You also can't add an ""exit task"" if you use display unlocked event context.

I thought I could be smart somehow and basically set my homescreen wallpaper with Nova, when unlocked, go back to the default homescreen wallpaper previously set (which has the correct crop). You can use display off as a context and treat it as a ""fake lock screen"", but that's not accurate. 

I basically wanted a custom wallpaper for the lock screen that is darker so I can read all my Dashclock widgets without having my homescreen wallpaper leaking through (which is pretty design intensive and hard to read over)

I don't like any lock screen replacements, etc. not sure if there is another way to do this. Maybe I need to mess around with wallpaper image size to make Tasker crop it differently or something?

I'm by no means a pro with Tasker

1. I'm having difficulty making Tasker display the scene nicely in fullscreen. Borders appear on the left and right sides of the scene grid, Tasker gives various display options (Overlay, fullscreen, full window, no title, etc), but I'm not sure which to chose to mimic a lockscreen

2. I'm not understanding which variable(s) to use between the text box input (the code entered) and the ""Enter"" or ""OK"" button to actually use the code that's entered (hope that makes sense). For example, the scene would be destroyed and the homescreen displayed. *If* the code were *4321*, the user info wipe would initiate. *If* the code were anything else, an ""Incorrect code"" popup or something similar would display. What I'm not understanding is how to program the ""Button1"" to check the specific input of ""Textbox1"" when clicked. Like, *When 'Button1' click, If 'Textbox1.text'=""1234"" Then* perform some task.

Wondering if anybody can help me out in creating a task that will use the Viper SmartStart app (app for Viper remote start systems) to start my car.

What I've thought of so far is using Load App followed by Dpad to try and navigate to the button that starts it, the interface on the main screen doesn't seem to register dpad movements.  Doing a search on Google for anybody else trying to accomplish the same reveals a post from 2010 where somebody figured out that the app can be interfaced with via https calls and using SL4A, but I have nooooooo idea how to even go about that.

Can anybody offer any suggestions or advice on how to make this work?  Thanks so much!",self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1ip2td/help_viper_smartstart/

I'm trying to create a music player widget with Minimalistic Text and Tasker, doesn't update when the song changes. According to the userguide, the way the variable works is:

* set %MTRACK on music play
* clear %MTRACK on music pause

However


Another issue I've run into is more of an OCD type of thing than anything else. I have it currently set so that when the play/pause button is pushed, then that means Play Music isn't running, and that it should start it. Ideally, I would have it start in the background, but I don't know how to do this. I have it set for now to launch Play Music, then to return home half a second later. It works, but it flashes the app screen for a split second


If anyone has any ideas


**EDIT:** Figured it out!

Changed the profile to:

1. If %Music != %MTRACK
2. If %MTRACK is set (Prevents widget from updating to just ""%MTRACK"")

then task:

1. Variable Set %Music to %MTRACK
2. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %music=%Music

The main differences in what I'm doing is that I'm relying on BT Connected instead of Car Docked for the state, and Notification Volume to 7.

In the actual task to read texts I've got the following:

1. Wait 6 seconds. //this ensures it's not trying to read a text over my notification
2. Set Media Volume = 0 //the media control functions are wonky/inconsistent w/ Pandora and Google Play
3. Set System Volume = 7 //it should already be at 7
4. Say ""%SMSRN says %SMSRB"" using System Stream //reads back the text
5. Set Media Volume = 12 //sets media volume back to what it should have been

If I just run the task absent the BT Connected-based profile

Unfortunately, as if it were reading at a 7 on a 15 scale (maybe even a little lower). This happens using any of the streams with a 7 max scale (ringer, notification, alarm, ~~call~~). *However*, actual Notifications and other System events play loudly, like you would expect with them set to max volume.

The easiest fix here is for me to set the media/voice volume to 7 and just turn up my head unit, but they don't, so I'm stuck.

I tried manually setting %VOLS to 12, but it doesn't wait until ""Say"" is done speaking, so any SMS with more than a few words gets played over.

Any ideas on how I can get ""Say"" to read back louder

**Cliffs: ""Say"" function using System stream reads back at 7/7 volume without BT connected

Car Home is still running in the background so bluetooth should stay on.

1368664012.0,1ef42j,[How To] Set up an NFC tag to 'lock' and 'unlock' certain applications.,PinkyThePig,10,3,0,"This step through will allow you to lock certain applications on your phone with a tap to an NFC tag. This would be useful if you were say giving the phone to your niece/son/daughter etc to play games on and didn't want them messing with your banking apps or the play store etc.

This setup requires 1(or more) Profile(s) and 2 or more tasks. Additional tasks and profiles are only needed if you wanted different passwords for each chunk of apps. Say you lock your phone and wanted to seperate into games

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not super secure and also make sure you hide (or lock) tasker so that they cannot simply enter tasker and turn the profile off.

First we start out with a Profile named Locked Applications 1.  
Select application &gt; then select everything you want locked with your passcode.

Make a new task called Passcode 1 that links to the above profile.  
1. Display &gt; Lock &gt; Set your code that will be typed in to access it. e.g. 2345 check allow cancel

Allow cancel adds a cancel button to the screen making it a bit easier to cancel out of the app back to homescreen. If you don't have full screen checked they can still tap portions of the app around the side of the lockscreen. And remember till off means you only have to type in the password once until the screen turns off whereas without it you have to type the password in every time you switch to the app.

Then make a second task Called NFC Locker  
1. Tasker &gt; Profile Status: set name by clicking mag glass. change Set: to toggle.

Bind this task to your NFC tag via something like NFC Task Launcher.

If you want additional passcodes for different things then add a new profile and task per each one then add the toggle for that profile inside the NFC task.

BONUS ROUND: If you want it to be one entry of passcode totally disables the password then I recommend changing it to the following.

Add to the passcode 1 task 
2. Profile status &gt; Name Locked Applications 1 &gt; Set: Off

This will set the profile off if the passcode if typed correctly. So typing in once will completely unlock it.",self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1ef42j/how_to_set_up_an_nfc_tag_to_lock_and_unlock/

edit: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8pjg7duj2zk46j2/HF19Sw1pad

explanation of the method i used.

the context for the quick charge is battery 0-70%

The first task is a popup with voice

yes -&gt; i airplane mode is not available for my nexus 4 so i have individually shut off each antenna and autosync etc

no -&gt; popup ""no problem!""

shut down -&gt; self explanatory

ONCE YOU ARE DONE CHARGING. I have set the exit task to ask you if you want to reboot

and voila your phone reboots and assumes its correct state.

---

This profile would be useful for people who just want to squeeze in as much juice as possible in the 10-15 minutes before they head out the door. I have a nexus 4 with god awful battery life and sometimes ill wake up after a night of clubbing getting ready to head to class and realize its only at 5-10%. normally I'd have to go through a few swipes and taps to turn on airplane mode or to turn off my phone which is not inconvenient in the least but obviously we can make that a more efficient and gangsta process.

TL;DR: get phone to ask you if you want to charge efficiently and respond to your commmand

---
My idea goes like so:

1) New Profile -&gt; State -&gt; Power (source: customizable by you) &amp;  Battery (percentage: customizable by you)

2) New Task ""Quick Charge Settings"" -&gt; Misc -&gt; Say ""hey big pimpin'

3) This is where I want tasker to be able to recognize me saying yes or no. I know that having the context of power (AC

4) if the voice thing is doable then I'd also add location awareness to the profile settings (Net ON

5) I'd also take it a step further and once it recognizes me saying yes I'd have it ask ""yo jiggaman, the following actions will occur.

6) Actions: Turn on airplane mode (mobile data, turn off ringers, turn down brightness and/or turn off screen, kill running programs and whatever else can be thought of.",,False,self,1365444516.0,t3_1bvxbh

1372198837.0,1h2gce,My Tasker keyguard off when connected to wifi task,trancemsteve,11,4,2,"Good evening all

I've had Tasker for a number of months now and just cannot stop learning with it.

One of my favourite tasks to be constantly tweaking (and a task that gets a lot of requests for help) is a keyguard off when connected to wifi.

I started out trying to use the variable %PACTIVE which I found tiresome at best as results completely varied seemingly based on weather

Lately it's been getting more and more accurate and I've now settled on a solution that I have yet to fail on me.

My thinking behind this is that it is really useful to have tasker decide what it's doing based on your whereabouts. With regards to the keyguard I wanted it to be off when I'm at home or work as well as if I'm in certain locations where I'll be using my phone a lot and where I feel is a safe place to have no keyguard. Sometimes though I'll be connected to a wifi where I definitely want my keyguard and sometimes I will connect to new routers where I want to have the keyguard removed without much hastle.

My thinking was to have global variables for %Home %Work %Safezone and %Inpublic which should all be self explanatory. Since home and work will rarely if ever change I keep those stored in tasker. For the safezones I store these in an oblique (/) separated text file. I match the ssid of the router I'm connected to either through the variables or the text file and based on the results it will either unlock

So without further ado here's the task:

        Turn Off Keyguard Request (13)
        A1: WiFi [ Set:On ] 
        A2: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:8 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ] 
        A3: If [ %WIFII ~ *connection* ]
        A4: Read File [ File:Tasker/textfiles/listofsaferouters.txt To Var:%saferouters ] 
        A5: Perform Task [ Name:GetSSID Stop:Off Priority:10 Parameter 1 (%par1): Parameter 2 (%par2): Return Value Variable: ] 
        A6: If [ %Ssid ~ %Homerouter ]
        A7: [X] Flash [ Text:Connecting to %Homerouter Long:Off ] 
        A8: Variable Set [ Name:%Home To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A9: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:39 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A10: Else If [ %Ssid ~ %Workrouter ]
        A11: [X] Flash [ Text:Connecting to %Workrouter Long:Off ] 
        A12: Variable Set [ Name:%Work To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A13: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A14: Else If [ %Ssid ~ %saferouters ]
        A15: Flash [ Text:Connecting to Safezone Long:Off ] 
        A16: Variable Set [ Name:%Safezone To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A17: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A18: Else 
        A19: Show Scene [ Name:Add To Safe Routers Display As:Dialog
        A20: Goto [ Type:End of If Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A21: End If 
        &lt;Last Endif&gt;
        A22: End If 
        A23: Variable Clear [ Name:%saferouters Pattern Matching:Off ]

As a step by step:

When I hit a shortcut on my home screen (I don't actually like the idea of automatically removing the lock as what happens if I'm on my homerouter but my young niece decides she wants to play a game on my phone and just mashes buttons with reckless abandon) my wifi turns on. There's a wait while the wifi connects. 

Tasker loads the list of safe routers from a text file and then launches a task to extract the ssid I'm connected to from %WIFII. SSID is checked first to see whether it's my home or work router, again if it is the unlock will be launched if not I will get a scene popup asking if I want to add that router to the text file (if I did it would launch a task that writes routername/ that way I don't have to go back and keep updating the text file manually).

Lastly for cleanliness sake it'll clean the variable for saferouters.

Hope this helps anyone looking for a solution

1369135026.0,1eraey,[Idea Requests] Nexus 7 Car Install,nealjr,10,3,6,"I've read the other Nexus 7 car install help requests and have some questions based off of the differences in my install.

My main hurdle at the moment is determining how to sync my home music library with a SSD connected via powered (currently via stock inverter) USB hub in my vehicle.

Sequence of events:

* Pull into garage.
* Nexus 7 automatically finds and connects to home wifi.
* Media Syncs.
* Nexus 7 enters a battery saving mode.

I currently have my media library on a Synology NAS but I've been debating converting an old laptop into a more sophisticated media server.  I'm flexible in this area if it means achieving my goal.

My other question is about the power connections inside of the vehicle.  There are a lot of great ideas on how to service a Nexus 7 and the associate peripherals (USB hub, SSD) but I've been waiting to firm up this area of my install until I sort out the sync issue.  I want the SSD and Nexus 7 to maintain power long enough to finish the sync'ing process before entering a state where they draw as little power as possible.

I've been able to emulate the work of others up until this point but unfortunately no install that I've found has had these requirements.  I'm no electrician but I'm proficient with a soldering iron.  I'm not sure if I need to worry about these small devices killing my car battery but I'm willing to modify cables and run wire to ensure it doesn't happen.

When you share from the imgur app, so I decided to give AutoShare a go and make something to pull in the raw link. While doing this, I figured I’d also keep track of what I shared in the form of a cheap little CSV with the link and title.  
  
**Profile**  
This part is simple
This profile runs the task described below.  
  
**Task**  
First thing I had to do was remove the http://imgur.com/ part from the shared URL and then do a HTTP Get.  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %astext  
* Splitter - http://imgur.com/ 
   
HTTP Get  
* Server:Port - http://imgur.com/  
* Path - %astest2  
* Output File - tmp/imgurTask.html  
  
Next I read the file created by HTTP Get into %image
I did this with variable splits simply because I was too lazy to actually write a script to clean this up
  
Read File  
* File - tmp/imgurTask.html  
* To Var - %image  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %image
* Splitter - &lt;img src=”  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %image2  
* Splitter - “  
  
Variable Set  
* Name - %imagelink  
* To - %image21  
  
And finally I set the clipboard to the link, %imagelink and Append and Add Newline checked as true. My personal task does a little more like flash a “Link copied” and downloads the image for offline viewing too. I also delete the tmp/imgurTask.html file created by the first HTTP Get, just to keep my sd card fairly cleaned up. On a side note, I’m sure there is an easier way to do this all, but this works just fine for me.

1366347176.0,1cntas,Project-NFC Based Timeclock Manager. Work in progress w/downloadable project file.,Landondo,10,2,5,"**Why I made this:**

I have to work 8 hours a day, because our timeclock at work is not very advanced.


**What it does**

* Writes the user's clock in time, final clock out time, and total hours worked to a text file in a /Timeclock folder on your SD card. This is done by executing the task with the NFC tag. It would be easy to make it activated by a widget or some other context instead if you prefer.

* On the first punch in, turns on sync, and turns off wifi. Since these are activated by a ""Work Mode"" profile, it is super easy to modify the setting changes to your needs.

* On the clock in after lunch

* On my final clock out it also audibly says how long my work day was and changes the %Atwork variable back to 0 to reverse the setting changes.

* It counts clock ins/outs based on a counter(%Workcounter) that counts from 0-3 then resets to 0. If you get this out of sync you will have to manually reset the variable. 


**How to get it to work:**

* Download the project and put it on your phone. 

* Import the project into Tasker.

* Program your NFC tag to activate the ""Timeclock"" task in tasker. You can use ""NFC Task Launcher"" or ""Tasker URL Launcher""(if it works on your phone) to do this.  


**Give me the damn profile already!**

* https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/106730378/Work_v2.prj.xml   (v2 updated with a minor fix)


**Known issues:**

* A couple of the groups of actions in the task can take up to 10 seconds to fully process. I'm not sure why it is taking so long

* This thing is bloated(too... many... variables). Making it do all the things I wanted it to do in the way I wanted it to do them proved to be more complicated than I had originally anticipated-but it works.

* Local variables don't seem to work right. When I started this I made all the variables global so I could easily track what's going on and identify problems. I changed all the variables to local variables by making the first letter lowercase and it didn't function properly. Ex. %Clockintime changed to %clockintime


**What I plan to improve:**

* Reduce the number of variables and actions to make it less bloated.

* Figure out why it wasn't working with mostly local variables

* Implement a widget/scene to tell you what mode it currently thinks the user is in

My goal with this task is to remove the lock screen entirely when im within my home radius. My assumption of what keygaurd does is disable the lock screen entirely so that when I power on it goes straight to the homescreen.

exit task: enable keygaurd. enable pattern lock (secure settings pro)

Tasker newbie here so go easy on me please.  I was attempting to create a profile/task to turn off mobile data and apply the wifi sleep policy as long as the device isn't plugged in if the screen is turned off and turn mobile data on and keep wifi on if the screen is turned on.  I used the Profile named Battsav context of time 00:00 to 23:59

1. If %SCREEN ~ OFF

|2. Mobile Data set OFF

|3. WiFi Sleep Policy Never While Plugged

4. Else If %SCREEN ~ ON

|5. Mobile Data Set On

|6. WiFi Sleep Policy Never

I have a second profile for when the phone is plugged in using the Profile Context of Power - Any and a task consisting of:

1. Profile Status Name Battsav Set Off

With an exit task consisting of:

1. Profile Status Name Battsav Set On.

Currently this task does absolutely nothing.  Mobile data and wifi stay in whatever state I set them regardless of screen or charging status.  Here's a [link](http://imgur.com/8MaZNqo) to a screenshot of the screen on/off task if that helps.  Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?


*Edit:  Also

Prior to this setup I tried a few different setups that had mixed results.  I tried creating a profile called ScreenOff using Display State Off as a trigger to run a task that turned mobile data off and a second profile called ScreenOn with Display State On as a trigger to run a task that turned mobile data on.  In that instance Tasker seemed to get confused and frequently have the wrong profile active when the screen was on, I had to turn data on manually.

So I tried adding exit tasks to each profile.  ScreenOn would turn itself off as an exit task as would ScreenOff.  That worked better but tasker still seemed to run the wrong task occasionally.  What eventually led me to trying the method outlined here was when I tried to add a profile related to charging my  phone called Plugged In.  That profile was triggered by Power Any and it turned off both ScreenOn and ScreenOff profiles and ran a new task to keep all data on and an exit task to turn both ScreenOn and ScreenOff back on and turn Plugged In off.  That addition fouled the whole thing up to where Plugged In would never turn off and data would constantly stay on.

I tried all this same stuff with Display On or Off Events as opposed to display on or off states and that did nothing at all.  Just enforced the settings defaults.

Profiles with events and profiles without events behave differently: profiles with events are instantaneous; they trigger new settings or actions and then that's that. On the other hand, etc.), and then restore the previous settings afterwards. For that reason, event profiles can't be assigned exit tasks – there's no end-point for Tasker to detect.  
  
Except when there is. When profiles contain both events and states
  
Here's an example: I need to put my phone into silent mode when I go to bed and back into vibrate mode when I wake up. I use a sleep cycle alarm clock (Sleep as Android)
  
Contexts  
1) State - Power AC  
2) Event - Initiate sleep tracking (via a Home Screen button)  
  
Enter Task  
1) Silent Mode  
2) Set %SLEEP variable to 1 (linked to call screening)  
3) Send sleep tracking intent to Sleep as Android  
  
Exit Task  
1) Vibrate Mode  
2) Clear %SLEEP variable  
3) Clear %DAILYBACKUP variable (linked to a separate task
  
This way, Tasker will run my exit task (including resetting my backup counter) *every time I unplug the phone*, rather than just when I wake up.  
  
I could get *close* to my solution by splitting this into three or four tasks

I have several profiles, one for the Car etc, that enables a specific behaviour on that location.

For some time I have tried to use wifi connected or wifi near to get this right

I have tried autolocation but with no great success. 
Boot: Enable autolocation
- I have created a circle around each location R=1km to enable ""balanced location"" when I am near my home/work etc. And a smaller circle R=150M to enable specific behaviour at home/work etc.
However this doesn't solve the problem. Sometimes the profiles doesn't trigger at all

1372134038.0,1h0nvj,I made a way to print text files from my phone on my raspberry pi thermal printer,PinkyThePig,7,2,1,"Needless to say the stuff in the task is pretty simple compared to the shit I had to wade through on my pi to get this all working. I'd say I probably spent 12-18 hours to connect the printer and diagnose all of the stupid mistakes I made on the way. I can elaborate on the printer setup if anyone is planning on replicating this but I figured I would include my tasker setup as the steps involved can easily be adapted to other uses/applications. 

On a side note does anyone know of a ssh command launcher that can handle multiple server addresses? The one I used on this task can only store a single server address which means I can either do printing from home or printing via cell connectivity (internal vs external IP).

    1. Variable Query %Printtxt
    2. Write file &gt; File tasker pi/print.txt
    3. FolderSync Plugin &gt; Sync tasker pi folder on phone with pi
    4. Wait 3 seconds
    5. SSH Command Plugin &gt; sudo sh startscript.sh

So now for an explanation:

Line 1 is purely for debugging

Line 2 Saves %Printtxt inside a folder as a txt file.

Line 3 Is setup to sync via SFTP the text folder on my phone with my raspberry pi

Line 4 is there to give the sync time to finish. On a 10 character file that is more than enough (100 ms or so was actually long enough) but I made it longer in case I need to print large files

Line 5 runs the start script on my raspberry pi which calls my custom python script (composed of 7 lines) that will actually print the file.

So now all I have to do if I ever need to print something is set what I want to print to %Printtxt and call this task and it will print!

Next project:

Print images from my pi/phone. It has a print image function but as far as I know the image has to be a .bmp monochrome color which I would need to find a way to convert the image.

1367819092.0,1ds0et,[How To] Explanation on how the APOD wallpaper task from the wiki works broken down.,PinkyThePig,10,4,2,"So I figure this would classify closer to a tutorial for a beginner at tasker to give them a more in depth look at how a task does what it does in a more easy to digest form. I personally glaze over when a long technical explanation is given at once. I have to see how the thing does what it does to actually understand it and be able to use it. So here is a task taken from [the wiki](http://tasker.wikidot.com/apodwallpaper) and broken down into more manageable chunks so you can see what goes on behind the scene.

First

Here are the instructions with a breakdown of each chunk.

   Create a context at 7:00 to 7:05

This actually triggers the change to happen every morning.

&gt;Make a folder APOD in the root of your SD card

This is required as tasker will not auto create a folder.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod

This actually pulls the source code for the website and stores to a universal

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD

This takes the %HTTPD variable and every time it encounters &lt;IMG SRC="" it will split the variable into a new offshoot. If you view the source code you will notice that this happens precisely where the background picture occurs. Delete Base will clear any previously set variables (basically making sure we have a blank slate). With the split everything before the IMG SRC becomes %HTTPD1 and everything after becomes %HTTPD2

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD2

With this step we currently have the picture URL at the beginning of the variable but a ton of junk after it. This step allows us to clean all of that out. %HTTPD21 now contains our 'clean' URL and %HTTPD22 and up contains the rest of the junk for the website.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod/%HTTPD21

This step takes our pretty URL which as of writing is image/1305/lemmon_rhemann_960.jpg and appends it to the URL to pull only the picture with the mime type specifying we want a picture format file and the output file is saying what and where we want to save it to.

&gt;    Set Wallpaper:Image=APOD/apod.jpg

This actually sets the wallpaper to the picture we just downloaded.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod

This and everything that follows is used to pull the Description in case you are curious or if you want to view it.

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD

This dumps everything out from before the start of the explanation

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD2

And dumps everything from the end

&gt;    Write File: File=APOD/apod.htm

Then writes everything to a file that can be read.

 and if the dir is empty; carry out the task as described. I would like this to be done on (or shortly after) startup.

Does anyone know how i would get tasker to check the output of ls /sdcard before carrying out the task?

Thanks in adv

TLDR: want to check output from execute plugin before performing task.

* Wireless on at home only.  Used [this](http://tasker.wikidot.com/low-battery-usage-wifi-enableing-profile-using-wifi-near) and it's working very well.
* Lower camera volume when camera app is run
* Lower/Disable volumes at night
* Silent mode when google calendar has a busy event but does not have the word ""Available"" in the description.  
* Reboot phone nightly
* Send txt to bank to retrieve balance daily
* Change brightness levels when in very bright conditions.
* EDIT:  Forgot
* EDIT2:  Added a task to update weather from [this site](http://www.thefuckingweather.com/) and display using Minimalistic Widget.

&gt;Dear Budding Graphic Designers
&gt;I need an icon for Zoom and my icon skills are
&gt;actually. 
&gt;Therefore it would be great if anyone was interested in tinkering with 
&gt;Photoshop / Gimp to come up with something. The rewards for the chosen 
&gt;icon would be many and as listed below
&gt;- a free Zoom licence code 
&gt;- mention in the in-app credits 
&gt;- a beautifully formulated thank you post 
&gt;The icon needs to be a 24 bit PNG
&gt;requirement). 
&gt;Zoom is a zoomable WYSIWYG widget editor. Widgets are organized in 
&gt;cells
&gt;I'll put up a website with some more info at zoom.dinglisch.net when I 
&gt;get the chance.
