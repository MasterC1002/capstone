I was browsing the school's library looking through all the books (Most of which completely bored me. It was a middle school in Alabama)

I decided to ask the librarian if there were any stories that took characters to space. She showed me a few titles I no longer remember and she could see they were a little too childish for me. So then she said ""Have you ever read anything by Douglas Adams? I bet his books will be right up your ally"" and smiled. She was right! I fell in love right away. I couldn't put it down.

I read during classes, they were furious. They tossed the book across the room and took it back to the librarian the next day and they took me with and had my library account deactivated. I was only to read books that were required by the school for classes and that was it. The librarian was horrified and she finally understood a lot about me without anything more having to be said.

Well, while I was in the library I'd read the book :) I didn't get to the other books until later that year because the lackluster library of the Alabama public school only had the first book.

However

Hitchhiker's was the first book I read that I wasn't allowed to read that I read anyway. It started my rebellion. ",,t5_2t9xb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1895di/share_your_own_hitchhiker_story_ill_go_first/

I'm hoping to sell the tickets so I can buy another pair for a night when my friend really is in London and, the cost of the tickets, and then I'll post them out to you for free! Because I love you.

**Don't Panic**

Everyone is a researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, for obvious reasons.
___________________________
Researchers:

Obtain a piece of paper. 

Write your name at the top of the paper.

Right under the name

Researchers have 2 stats: Froodidity and Towel. Divide 12 points between the two stats.

Write down the names of the other researchers. After each name write “owes me __ drinks.” The blank starts at 0.

For any action where effectiveness, roll 1d12+froodidity. Any result 12+ is a success.

For any action where life, roll 1d12+towel. Any result 12+ is a success. Narrate how you use your towel to get out of trouble.

If you fail

If they succeed, they might demand their drink right then and there. Don't flake out dude, they just saved your life.

If they fail
_________________________
Guide:
Mediate the game. Play happens in 4 stages.

1. Consulting the Guide: Give the researchers a topic from the guide, dangerous, and ridiculous.

2. Making the Plan: The researchers discus how to go about proving/disproving the facts given. Roleplay scenes about getting supplies

3. Carrying out the Plan: Set up and run the experiment

4. Getting Drunk: Pay off any drinks owed. Discuss your findings. Decide on a new,,False,,t5_2t9xb,False,,True

But if the Heart of Gold (HoG) was brought into the universe Zaphod must have entered it within an unknown period between **exiting** the Total Perspective Vortex (TPV) and saving Arthur &amp; Ford. For at no point before the TPV does he have the HoG.

I'd like to apologize in advance for my extremely long post.

   I've been through so much with this amazing book. I remember back in 7th grade when I saw my friend holding his Hitchhiker's Guide and I asked him about it. I had seen the movie a couple years before, but after reading one page I was hooked. I only like a handful of books, but books hold sentimental value to me so I didn't want to borrow his because of the fear of accidentally damaging it. That night, I ordered this copy online and I waited impatiently for it to arrive.
   
When it did arrive
  
 I'd respond with
  
 My friends would have no idea what they were getting themselves into when they asked ""What is it about?"" I'm sure they had no idea they were about to get a 15 minute overview of a book that seemingly had no plot or sense whatsoever.
   
One of the classes I had was being a library helper
   
The librarian said
  
 I tried explaining
 
  She then told me in a terrible attitude
   
I said, but it's pretty hard to 'laugh in your head'. This book is very funny; I'm going to keep reading it, and when I get to a part I think is quite humerous, I'm going to laugh at it.""
   
About a minute later, I laughed. This made the librarian pretty mad and she gave me ISS. Yep, ISS for laughing at a book in a library.
   I'm sure you can guess what I did all day in ISS.

   
It's also quite hard to explain a funny part in the book to people. I would read a really funny line and my friend would ask what I was laughing at. I'd try to read him the line
   
It's also hard to find people to talk to about this book. I've only got about 2 friends or so that have read it
   
In the past couple of years
   
I also love the subtle humor it has. Like how Arthur's house was being destroyed to make a bypass, they told the humans that it had been posted in Alpha Centauri for fifty years, so they had plenty of time to file a complaint. I've tried putting post-it notes on the pages that something funny happens, but I gave up because of the extreme amount of post-it notes I was going through.
   
I'm sure many of you have lost interest in my life story by now

The J'ardeen are a curious race. They are one of the only four species to make itself extinct. The most famous of these species is of course the Dodo, but stupid, nature would have turned them into pets instead of a Sunday roast. The J'ardeen went extinct not due to wanting a hug, but due to a thirst for knowledge. Before 42, the answer to life, the universe and everything, many philosophers were still trying to find out the meaning of life. The J'ardeen were a deeply philosophical species, meaningful life had it not been slowly dissolved in it's seven heeloglans. Two million years and twelve exploded brains later and a plucky young J'ardling put forward his idea. It went like this: Blarg blarg blarg blarg, in fact, when death was put forward as the answer



A Smugian is a large green slug. It is approximately 12Dr long, created the universe it must have taken a long time. Many people think Smugia was the result of God having a break, and deciding to have a dump in the middle of the universe. Much like the Vogons, evolution took one look and the green turd crawling along the floor and decided to go have a hamburger instead. The most popular theory is their smell scared it away. Smugians do not have noses, they cannot smell the richest perfumes that a Dafer emits from its rear end. Unfortunately, this is why they're still here. If they had noses, their whole body would be inside out. It's a weird reflex to try and hide from a predator or anything harmful (They never use it since everything's already been killed by their stench). The slug would turn itself inside out to try and protect itself from the odour. If this did happen, slowly killing them. If would be unselfish, deaths. The most popular death on the galactic show, since when their heads do explode

Fig.1: [Don't Panic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1horffGyO0)  Starting with Coldplay's debut album, entitled ""Don't Panic."" While the song itself seems to contain nonexistent Guide references, that's why it's number 1.


Fig.2: [42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0xfWCDLoCU)  Skip ahead a few years; and the reference here is pretty obvious, if we continue down the album...


Fig.3: [Strawberry Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb9X5jMofEo)  One of (literally!) the most peaceful songs in modern music, death, and consequence of power, Strawberry Swing steps away from that. It's a song about being happy in the face of loss and death, because you'll always have your loved ones. Trust me on this: *Viva La Vida's* music videos don't do the album justice. I digress. You hear that?  
&gt; ... cold cold water

Go ahead. Deny it. Because that one line is going to be recurring throughout the whole album.


Fig.4: [Life in Technicolor ii](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXSovfzyx28)  Life in Technicolor ii is one of my favorite songs. Like, this B-side is just littered with this one, solid theme that is a direct reference to the Guide. Gotten to the chorus yet? Then you've probably already heard  &gt; ...now my feet won't touch the ground...  Yes, in the *chorus!* Your counterargument is getting weaker and weaker, Debby Doubter!


Fig.5: [Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZIoFXmWbv0)  A sort of spiritual successor to *X And Y's* ""'Till Kingdom Come, lyrics and title.

In the end

A couple of days later I decided to bring the book along to a road-trip my family were taking. Mum and Dad in the front of the car, being forced to compliment the alien on his poetry - and decided that reading this book was the greatest idea I'd ever had. I loved it,

My mum turned round and asked me what I was reading. When I told her, eventually, having to stop because, every time, she'd end up bursting out laughing in front of an entire carriage. Knowing how quiet and awkward London tube trains are, I can imagine just how embarassing that would be. My Dad, it transpired, and had given my mother the first book about the time they got engaged.

1371084403.0,1g8i2b,De-Mail &amp; Hyper-Coke: A Loving Homage to HHGG,DSPR,1,0,0,"This is a short excerpt from a sci-fi romantic comedy book which contains a pretty obvious homage to HHGG. I hope it's on topic. Because it's pretty rare to find HHGG-like stuff out there.

(If it's not on-topic

------

So... De-Mail. What is it exactly? And how does it work? Glad you asked. Let me see if I can describe it for you. It works like this. You send an electronic message to this service, lick it, close it, stamp it, press it, write the addresses on the envelope by hand, then place in a mail bag, walk the horse into a shuttle, then the shuttle de-berths, every time)

This same incredibly wealthy woman also hired Stanley Opolis to build for her a custom fleet of android pool boys, and the exact abs of Ryan Reynolds of Earth. She was also quite adamant about having each android so well-hung that Stanley had to briefly bring a horse into his software studio when finalizing the design models for them in order to ensure that the androids ""equipment"" was realistic enough for her.

It was so realistic she was found dead a mere month after delivery. Her body by the side of the pool, and, a short meteoric boost in the sales of custom android pool boys. It made Stanley a small fortune, and it was yet another small fortune made from what was, from his point-of-view, merely a side project.) After her death her estate was divided up, except for her pool --- the gigantic private ocean filled with Hyper-Coke -- which was abandoned and left to go wild. Within a decade a new ecosystem was flourishing in the now untended ocean-sized pool, sometimes accidents happen from time to time. It's been said that if you're ever in a ship that MUST crash land on the nearest planet, alone in the darkness

Hyper-Coke also tastes pretty good. But we'll explain more about this later.",,t5_2t9xb,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DontPanic/comments/1g8i2b/demail_hypercoke_a_loving_homage_to_hhgg/
