Since you all know, so I took the time to build this simple script for Hola, with which you can switch between the following 6 Netflix regions (currently, hopefully more soon):
Netflix USA, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark.

All you need is [Hola Unblocker](http://hola.org) installed in your browser (awesome plugin) and [the script that I made](http://hola.org/unblocker?hscript=ccd652c20a5f98e8&amp;sites=netflix-us+netflix-gb+netflix-ie) (if you cannot download it over the hola site

After you have installed both Hola and the script

Now for the content. I have discovered this awesome site called [Moreflix.com](http://moreflix.com) (I believe through reddit :) ), and you can instantly stream it, by just switching on the UK button for Netflix in the Hola control pannel.

TL;DR
You can switch between 6 regions of Netflix by installing [Hola addon for your browser](http://hola.org) and [this simple script that I made for Hola](http://hola.org/unblocker?hscript=ccd652c20a5f98e8&amp;sites=netflix-us+netflix-gb+netflix-ie)

I'm a 31 yr old dude's dude &amp; I would normally look at a show that is pretty much all about women - and in which the only male characters are mostly badly written/acted - as not really ""my thing"" nor interesting to me... but this show is different. 

The writing is A+ all around; the flow, the flashbacks. Superbly crafted screenwriting. 

The directing isn't going to wow you with artistic shots

The dramatic scenes are just as good if not better than the comedy... though comparitively much more scarce. The scenes between the wife and her husband 'turned' transsexual are incredibly deep.

The casting is really *really* good (sans the male corrections officers) &amp; I haven't seen a character as intriguing as the transsexual inmate in any show in a while (who BTW is actually played by a real transsexual inherently adding much deeper realism to her character). 

The comedy starts off kind of weak and dry

Hi. This is [name removed]. How can I help you today?

*You

Hello! I am accessing Netflix from my computer, don't seem to have an instant queue on my account at all. I have signed up before, and have had one, so I don't know what the issue could be.

*Netflix

Hmm. That sounds pretty weird. Lets get to the bottom of that for you. Who am I chatting with today?

*You

My name is XXXXXX.

*Netflix

Hi XXXXXX. Let me check on this for you right now.

*You

I appreciate it

*Netflix

While I'm checking on this

*Netflix

No worries

*You

It's been pretty great! It's my first weekend off in awhile

*You

How about yourself? Have all your chat clients been friendly today?

*You

I have a few friends who work in chat support

*Netflix

Ah that's pretty cool I use to never have weekends off. It's my Friday though. And yeah

*You

Well

*Netflix

Thanks! I'm still looking into this for you XXXXXX. I appreciate your patience.

*You

My pleasure, then subsequently don't.

*Netflix

Ah I see what happened. It looks like we are trying some things out with some of our new members

*You

Oh

*Netflix

Well I don't want to make any promises I can't keep but submitting your feedback definitely helps change things. Especially since they know they're not fooling you. You know there use to be an instant queue.

*You

Hahaha, especially with such an eclectic selection is a pretty key feature to me. Please be so kind as to let them know that if they attempt to remove this feature, I will most likely not remain with the service for long. In contrast, you have been an absolute pleasure, [name removed]. Thank you for your help today :).

*Netflix

Hey I don't blame you

*You

I sincerely appreciate that, though, thank you so much for your assistance. Enjoy the rest of your ""Friday"", and your weekend! :D

*Netflix

Thanks. I appreciate it. Well I hope you continue to have a laid back weekend, please stay online for a one question survey.

I love my husband but I'd be lying if I said he wasn't a bit sexist... he's a typical 'jocky boy'

After much whining and sighing, it was clear he was getting into it. By the time the 2nd episode was over he said ""Okay, so this actually isn't bad.""

But it was the third episode that made him start crying! I was so shocked. I have only seen my husband cry two times in the 6 years we have been together; when our daughter was born

[Very mild episode 3 spoilers ahead]

My husband has always tried to be open minded, he's pretty much expresses his discomfort with the subject, and even hateful things such as ""They aren't REAL women/men"". It's always bothered me, and while he's gotten better over the years, he is still very ignorant about the subject.

So we're at the part where Burset is buying shoes for her son and then her old co-worker comes in and sees her, I hear a sniffle and look over and my husband is trying really hard to hide the fact that he's been crying! I paused the show and asked him if he was alright, and that just made him cry even more! 

My husband told me after a minute that it was ""upsetting to see, family, and son...you have to be suffering a lot if you would willingly go down a path that makes everyone hate you for it.""

We talked for about 10 more mins before continuing to watch the rest, it's still not okay for people like him to treat them like crap or treat them like their gender isn't 'real' just because in the past they were someone else.


I was so damn shocked hearing all of this! Shocked, he said he felt really terrible because one of his old friends had come out to him years ago. He was looking for support, but my husband said it freaked him out too much, so he stopped being friends with him and hadn't talked to him since. 

So

To make an already long story short, if it helps people like my husband become more open minded, then I'll take it.

Matt Walton · Sacramento
Dear Mr. Hastings

Every so often some genius with a crazy idea comes along and creates a product that is so brilliant it becomes an integral part of the fabric of society. These people usually have a bold and overreaching vision, and are willing to make the risky, bet-the-company moves that such a dream requires. Throw in a bit of serendipity and they change the world. You, sir, are one of those people, and Netflix is one of those products. You are one of my heroes.

When a product reaches the status of Netflix, you practically have to kick your customers in the face to get them to stop giving you money.

Netflix is there. You've created a multibillion-dollar company that grows by huge amounts every quarter. You win. You did it. Congratulations! Netflix is invisible and indispensable. I've never been able to imagine not having it; it's like my electric bill. For some time now I've viewed Netflix as this untouchable company that would continue to grow and innovate

I have been a member of Netflix since the summer of of 1999, that I still get riled up thinking about it. I signed up for your subscription plan in December of 1999 and the first movie I got was Intolerance (1916) (for a film history class). I kept it for a YEAR! At first it was just because it's a difficult film to sit through. Slowly, the longer I kept it, it became a test of your ""no late fees"" mantra, almost like I was taking out my $56 late fee on that movie! I kept expecting to get an email from you guys asking where it was. Then finally, and triumphantly, it became an icon for the success of your business model. I was sold. I bragged about Netflix to everyone and would show them my copy of Intolerance (""No, EVER!"").

I'm a very loyal customer and loyalty means a lot to me. In the last several years you've made changes that have made the service less useful to me, which is crucial to the way I use the service. These changes have resulted in me using Netflix less and less. I slowly stopped rating films because there was no one to show them to. Before long I realized the same 3 DVDs have been on my shelf for six months. But I still kept the brand. I still kept paying.

The industry has changed a lot since you started Netflix. There are now many options for watching content online. I've been an Amazon Prime member for awhile now and out of nowhere they started offering free movies. And iTunes selection and interface is amazing. Despite all my choices

You have obviously made some great decisions at Netflix as the company is wildly successful. You've made some decisions that seemed crazy at the time, but I think you're wrong.

Some companies -- huge, then MySpace). What makes companies fall overnight is a shift in the collective mindset. Such a change requires a catalyst, that kick in the face I mentioned earlier. For MySpace users, the kick in the face was Facebook. And once you get kicked in the face it shocks you into seeing things differently. It's like a spell is broken. And then, without even knowing exactly how it happened, yesterday you thought MySpace was irreplaceable, and today you'll never log on again. Shifts in collective mindsets topple countries.

For Netflix customers, the splitting of DVDs and streaming. By splitting them out, you created a new way of looking at your product. Before it was just a ridiculously large library of DVDs plus the added bonus of UNLIMITED streaming now and then when one of my shows or movies was available. It was a package that caused me to never think about either. Upon splitting I suddenly realize that they both suck for me. When I was forced to view DVDs separately, I realized I wasn't watching nearly enough to make the plan worth it. And when forced to view Streaming separately, I realized how deficient the library was especially compared to other options. It wasn't a viable product on its own. I could easily rent all the movies and buy all the shows on iTunes that I watch in a month and pay way less. Before viewing them separately I never cared about this.

Yet, and hearing the grumbling all over the internet, I was willing to stay with you. I was going to pay the new price for both plans and go back to not thinking about it. That was until I heard about the third kick in the face, Qwikster. Companies don't split up when they are successful. They grow and acquire. Companies have to be forced to split up by the government or due to seriously bad financial circumstances. Your shareholders have shown you what they think of Qwikster. The explanation you give, wanting to promote the products separately, doesn't make any rational sense. Everyone, from four-year-olds to 99-year-olds

Why not use the gigantic cash-cow

Please, rash, impulsive decision to REVERSE your decision to split up Netflix. Give us back our old Netflix. Give us back the one thing that no one else was giving us: unlimited DVDs and unlimited streaming in a single package.

I love Netflix. And for the first time in twelve years I'm actually seriously considering canceling my account. Once my DVDs move to Qwikster

Thanks for listening
A Very Loyal Customer.
Matt Walton

I grew up in the late 80's/90's and was a big fan of the Friday night sitcom block of programming on ABC known as TGIF. I have a feeling I'm not alone in this.

Here's the blurb from the sidebar:
I have a goal. I want to build a community around enjoying the best

There are two simple rules.

1. **No jumping ahead!** You watch one episode of each series each week. Can't wait to see how a very special two-part episode of Cheers plays out? Too bad. When these shows aired originally

2. **No spoiling!** Given the very nature of what we're trying to do here

As you can see

I think we all know one of the best parts of watching TV as it airs is to have a chance to discuss the week's episode with your friends. I want to bring this concept to watching the best Netflix has to offer on streaming.

**What do I need from you?**
I'm looking for help in getting interested redditors to subscribe and contribute their thoughts to the discussion. That's it. I could also use some help figuring out other subreddits to advertise to that might show some interest in joining the club.

This is at this point, so any ideas to improve upon it would be greatly appreciated.

It somewhat does what its meant to do. It plays around 2 episodes before I need to hit play. However

I understand that playing all the episodes with no one watching is a waste of bandwith. I've tried finding ways around the pop up by showing Netflix that I'm still on the computer watching it. 

1. I've moved the mouse and actively used the computer but it still pops up. This should show that I'm on the computer but I'm not sure if it's even possible for Netflix to detect mouse movement. 
2. I've clicked on the icon on the bottom right that appears once the episode has ended. If I'm clicking to play the next episode then Netflix should play it in its entirety but it doesn't.
3. I've paused and pressed play on an episode only to have auto play show up 2 minutes later. If I JUST paused it and played it

In other words

First world problem maybe but I demand satisfaction. ",,t5_2qoxj,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/zx60f/while_autoplay_initially_seemed_like_a_good_idea/

I really enjoy Netflix

Here's the places where cable just fails:

* Commercials:  My time is worth a too much for you to waste it with commercials.   (Edit: my math was wrong.  It's 64 cents per 32 commercials, not the product.   If you need to charge me 64 cents more per show I watch to get it commercial free, I'll gladly pay.

*  Selection:  Let me stream every episode of every show I have access to.  Maybe not every nightly news episode, if I'm streaming episodes, default to starting me at the first episode of that show and working my way to current episodes.  

* Tracking:  Remember where I was.  Remember what episodes I've watched.  This isn't hard.  If I watch a new episode live

* Recommendations:  You know what shows I watch.  Recommend ones you think I'd also like.  It doesn't have to be all that complicated.  Figure something out.

* Pictures not Text:  This isn't 1980.  Providing a folder based interface with text names of shows and episodes is ridiculous.   Look at Netflix.  They do this right.

* Devices:  I can watch Netflix on my laptop, and damn near anything that can play video.  Hire the programmers.  Get it done.

I think the problem is that cable companies see themselves as selling you channels, it's obvious as a consumer where I want things to go.

We're all disc-renters &amp; movie streamers at the end of the day.  It is possible to write an engaging, or that somehow because you saw a movie at a film festival, your take is more *valid*.

I imagine this crap is so prevalent because the ""top rated review"" is the one that almost always starts out with the ""I saw it at a festival before you"" cringe-inducer.  It's now a ""formula"", punctuation, &amp; grammar, along with the sheer *laziness*, offer zero value.

Similar to Anthony Hopkins as Titus Andronicus or Ian McKellen as Richard III

I think

The supporting cast does tremendous work as well, and Gerard Butler.  I think that Brian Cox as Senator Menenius, an aging and cagey politico searching for a point of compromise between a popular uprising and an elite, between internal and external threats.  And the most important piece in that game is realized in Ralph Fiennes' performance as well as his vision as a director.

* Less expensive than Netflix streaming only
* First year is 50% off
* Free two-day shipping on Amazon-Prime items (which can be very useful on items where the vendor jacks up the shipping price)

5. Push the guide button on your 360 controller

6. Go two spaces to the right and it will list all of your available Quickplay choices. Scroll down and click Netflix.

7. Netflix will give you a code which you must enter here https://account.netflix.com/Activate

Enjoy.

Also after activating you need only do steps 5-6 to reach Netflix again.

Multiple people on GameFAQs have confirmed that this works

EDIT: I can personally confirm that this works. Make sure that when you open Netflix you're selecting it from the list on the ""All"" tab in the Quickplay menu on the Xbox Guide

**†It should be clarified that just because these titles are listed as expiring on July 1, which may or may not get reupped. This list should not sensationalize the loss of titles, this happens all the time, Netflix's catalog is constantly in flux. However, if you have been planning on watching any of these titles, it might be a good idea to check them out before July 1, just in case.**

From an [article that quoted this](http://www.webpronews.com/is-netflix-about-to-lose-a-bunch-of-pbs-content-2013-06)

&gt;Basically, Netflix will decide it’s not worth it to keep paying for it. In the case of the titles in question, most probably just aren’t getting enough views to make it worth Netflix’s money.

2. I was able to watch the whole thing but would not want to watch again

That isn't the reason to skip it, and what's worse, the _entire episode_ is included in the 2-part ""The Menagerie,"" where Spock, more or less, recounts the events of the episode, and nothing but the credits is left out.

_Trek_ purists probably love the fact that ""The Cage"" is included on Netflix for streaming, on its own. However, it's irrelevant to the story at that point for a first-time viewer, and ""The Menagerie"" puts it in a much better context. We don't care about Spock's first assignment before meeting the rest of the crew... but we do care why Spock does what he does in the 2-parter.

The alternative is,"" it's boring because, as I said, it wholly contains ""The Cage."" You don't want to skip ahead because it's interwoven with the present story, and it's probably the best Spock episode so far. So, Trek on, but don't watch the pilot twice.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1iprjq/lpt_if_youre_going_to_watch_the_original_star/
