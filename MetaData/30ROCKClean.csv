What I'm suggesting is a no spoiler period lasting 24 hours. Not everyone gets to see the episode when it airs on thursday. At a certain point, you make people like me choose between: 

* seeing all the jokes and enjoying the show a lot less
* not going on reddit all of friday
* unsubscribing from the subreddit.

It's the episode where they're all playing Poker and Jack gets obsessed with knowing how Kenneth plays Poker. But, the line that got me is when Tina Fey things she's a lesbian and is mentioning her previous boyfriends, she goes, ""Then there was that tall, gangly red haired guy that played guitar all the time - Conan."" 

Pretty sure it's a reference to Conan O'Brien that just about slipped under my radar but I caught it. Things like this really make me love this show! :) I can't wait to keep watching it, it's getting better and better! It sort of feels like SNL sometimes with its skit-like comedy and how it shows off all the scenes of NYC, it really makes me want to visit/live there... Does anyone else feel the same way? :D

First off, there is the homeless man, [""Moon Vest"" whom you may remember from when Kenneth pitches the ""Gold Case"" game show concept to NBC in ""The Head and the Hair""](http://i.imgur.com/YYYbF.jpg).  Imagine my surprise when I was watching ""Audition Day"" and saw [who backs away from Jack on the subway when he announces he has bed bugs!](http://i.imgur.com/DfF9A.jpg).  That one I noticed myself, but then I googled ""Moon Vest"" and found out he's also in [""I Do I Do"" playing the loud song that is keeping Jack and Avery from talking](http://i.imgur.com/IS9sA.jpg).  

Also, I was watching the episode ""Larry King"" where Liz has to go to a bad part of Queens with Kenneth to retrieve her lost cell phone from a cabbie.  [Note the poster in the background as they exit the subway](http://i.imgur.com/plVFj.jpg).

I thought it might be a fun idea to discuss new episodes like they do on r/community.

So what did everyone like / dislike?

I thought Jenna had a few good lines, most noticeably the one about vagi mesh or something.

However I would say that this episode seemed really off. The way the camera followed the scenes and certain cuts were really odd. I don't mind changing the way they do things but in more than one case it disrupted the flow of the story / jokes etc.

Granted, some of the jokes weren't as great (or maybe the laughter just turned me off) as the regular show, but I've never heard/thought of a show producing a live one!

This episode just compounded all my glee from every past season into one, being able to see all the actors perform live and everything. I'm sure you guys have had it with people talking about this episode but I just want to tell the whole world about this show and this episode. 

But anyways, I'll leave because I don't want to spoil the rest of the season!

When Tracy was going on that date for Kenneth in ""St Valentines Day"", Dot Com speaks in French. When Kenneth/Tracy's date comments on this, Tracys says ""I learned on a website, stop showing off dot com.""

When Jack was trying to convince Tracy to speak for the Republican party, bringing up Lincoln, Dot Com mentions some historical context, and Jack asks ""Why must he be so off-putting"".

I just saw him get wine thrown in his face by a dog on the Queen of Jordan episode.

edit: I just saw another one.  After Tracy came back from 'Africa', Dot Com is welcoming him back and Tracy cuts him off, saying 'Great impression of a guy that sucks, Dot Com!'.  

So I ask:  Why does everyone hate Dot Com?
