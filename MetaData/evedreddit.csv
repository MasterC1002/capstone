1323691583.0,n9kv8,First few days in Dreddit.,Evian_Drinker,192,36,72,"So i joined up on a whim after stumbling into the 21 day invite thread last Friday - Dodeca Hedron providing me with the initial invite

By the time i had completed the Military and Industrial tutorials i figured i knew everything i needed to know to play Eve and was enjoying flying towards stuff to see if my ship would blow up (kind of disappointed their is no collision damage tbh).

Then my application for TEST got approved and i realized just how little i knew. Everyone on Team Speak 3 and in Corp chat were speaking English - but it made no sense to me. People kept talking about ""Dictors

Luckily no-one in DeeDeeReddit shouts at you for asking dumb ass questions so i only every seem to be in the dark for a few moments at a time (that and the Wiki). Within an hour i was in Curse being given a handful of free ships (most of the mods wouldn't work at this point due to me learning Survey to lvl 3 for the first day!) and then managed to fuck up the first two fleet instructions as Madlof Chev tried herding cats with us - teaching the basics of flying internet spaceships in combat.

He and Nikolai did kill me mind

As i went to collect another ship Pidgin popped up. letting me know a fleet was forming in H-ADOC. 

Thanks to a Family Christmas party (hosted by My wife and I) the next day I already had my wife giving evil eyes as I joined the fleet. Given my experience during the rest of the day I figured I would be dead within minutes anyway so largely ignored her and tried to figure out how to warp to a Titan (by the way these things are fucking huge).

Moments later we're on the other side of Eve and I’ve lost the fleet again - I warp in to a random member @10km as the fleet jumps to another system. Burning to the gate (I can use a Micro Warp Drive by this point) we jump into the hostile fleet as they sit off gate.

It's around now that someone in DeeDeeReddit mentions that Tengu's

28km...

25km...

Fuck I've forgotten to turn on my MWD. The hostiles warp out

Second chance.

I activate the Drive and get shot before I start moving. A Tengu on my Overview has a red box around it - i vaguely remember that means something bad so i lock him up and head towards him. Second volley hits me and my armour vanishes slipping into hull. The FC shouts to get tackle on a Tengu as they warp out again. At this point i'm still zooming towards the Tengu - 18km away. I Wonder what the range is on my Warp Scrambler and decide to try to activate it anyway. It turns green and a little icon appears next to the Tengu. Moments later the fleet catches up and melt his ship. Thankfully i think he shit bricks at some point as he thankfully stopped shooting me at 20% hull.

Over the next few minutes i tackled a few more and learnt the value of keeping distance from the enemy fleet until tackle is called for.

In the afterglow of the fleet my name got passed around. Shadoo the FC donated 500 million ISk to me as a thank you for getting the first Tengu

My first night playing Eve wrenched me from pure terror

Thank you to everyone in Dreddit

Mind I’ve since turned down my settings so  my PC doesn't melt though the desk

If you are a ""Lurker"" and have a reddit account that just *barely* meets the requirements to get in or has a lack of comments/recent comments then the only way for me to check you are actually a lurker is to view your voting history.

So save us both time and make your voting public. 
&gt; You can allow us to view your votes by enabling it in the preferences section of Reddit

**Do not submit applications for all your alts.**

This is very annoying. If you do not have at least one character in TEST do not submit alt applications. Apply with your main and then once you are in you can shit up the queue with lots of alt apps. I'll be withdrawing alt applications when I notice them

**Don't:** Shit up the queue with alts when you aren't already a member of TEST.

**Do:** Add the api of alt accounts and wait till you get into Dreddit to submit applications for all your alts.

**Do not submit applications if you don't meet the requirements.**

You might laugh at this, hope this is ok""*. Sorry, but no. Requirements are requirements. They aren't up for negotiation unless they have been approved by a director.

**In-game apps:**

Please for the sake of this bag of kittens I have ready to throw into a river

**Those with roles in current corp:**

Try to drop roles and have the in-game app ready to accept. Don't worry, you may as well prepare and get those roles dropped. Saves waiting in the application queue for an extra 24 hours.

**Use the message feature in auth.**

Sometimes you are asked to change or update something. You probably got a message from a specific HR drone when replying to them that you fixed it

**Don't be in Jita 4-4 while you have an application open.**

If you get accepted while you're in Jita 4-4. Kiss your ass goodbye. We are constantly at war with terrible ""pvp"" high sec corps who do nothing but camp the Jita undock. 

** A Word about our Joining Requirements:**

Please don't take the joining requirements as some sort end goal to reach to get in and then be done with reddit. That isn't the point. The point is to let Redditors in. I've said it a million times already, you will come across as a massive asshole and will probably destroy any chance of ever getting in. We know what our own requirements are, you don't have to quote them to us.

Residents of OWXT certainly recognize the name. That guy roamed our space for some time like he owned it. I started observing him. Watching intel channels reportings when he was away. Scanning with my directional while he was in local

I found out I often could spot him within scanner range of the station but rarely (never?) on the station’s grid itself. Planet IV being an obvious nearby spot

Of course, once again, I got a close range spike for a Rupture named “Fugly”. I warped blind to Planet IV at zero in a hurry. Look at what I found... This time, he was a meagre 125..130 km away, in a perfect line with 3T7-M8 stargate. At this point, Im fairly certain he likes to warp to P IV at 100 from 3T7 gate, presumably to scan the station. It seam to be part of his patrol pattern. That’s why I think he got complacent. He showed a pattern and kept showing it. I locked my throttle to “rabbit” and burned toward him. At some point he even turned back and approached me but he must have said fuck it and warped out to some unknown point in space. I reported this precious intel into dk_surveillance.

Next round, actually. 

BAM! He landed exactly where I expected him to land. Spot on. Everything happened so fast. Go go Warrior IIs. I overloaded the entire top rack. My shields basically vanished in a blink. My armor went down to 50% in another blink. Meanwhile his shields were at/or near peak recharge (35%?). At this point, I collected sufficient presence to “look at” his ship and place myself essentially in formation with him. This dropped transversal to low double digits in a pinch. Meanwhile intel chan’s people are like “wow, totally usefull and shit”. Made me giggle, actually. 8jane formed fleet with me. At this point im entering structure. He is in very low armor. I turn OFF overheat as my guns are about to burn out. I have hope. I think I can win this fight actually... and I did! Fugly exploded. His pod escaped by less than a second. 8jane landed next to me just after the fight ended. My hands are left shaking due to the adrenaline inrush and the victory’s exaltation. 

I won this by a thread

All his stuff is for sale in OWXT station actual at or (slightly) under regional average. Thanks you for shopping in OWXT. ",self,t5_2rhwu,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/csxim/first_solo_kill_thats_where_it_begin/

'Twas the night before Christmas
Not a TESTie was stirring
The Rifters were docked on their platforms with care
In hopes that -A- soon would be there.

The newbros were nestled all snug in their beds
While memories of gudfites played out in their heads.  
My cat in his collar and I wearing naught
Had just settled down after many Serpentis rats fought.

When out of the station there arose such a clatter
I undocked in my Manticore to see what was the matter.  
My grid slowly loaded,  
And I docked the hell back up

The planet with it's dark side made the ships stand out
-A- had come knocking
So I raised the alarm
The pilots arose

One FC stood alone
He gathered his men and flew into the night.  
More rapid than rockets his brave pilots flew out
And he cued his mic

""Now Dictors! now Hictors! now Logis and 'Nados!  
On Talos! on Naga! on Drake and on Phobos!  
From the top of the grid
Primary

Like kindling before an open flame will burn
A terrible lesson the -A- badposters quickly learned.  
So out of the bubbles the sperglords aligned
With TEST in pursuit

And then,  
""Make them burn
As I kicked on my 'burner
A red cyno went up

There were titans and dreadnoughts
We watched as they appeared
In tight formation they flew
The subcap fleet huddling under their protective pall.

Their guns
The battle was lost
When in our ears the comms started blaring
Fear not dear TESTies

Galvanized we flew into the enemy's maw
Missiles streaking
Our ceptors gave us warpin's deep in their ranks
They were certain to die

Our capitals undocked
With Foxcat support
The carriers triaged
And what happened next had to be seen to be believed.

Bombers uncloaked
And one by one the enemies started to explode.  
Railguns,  
All of this was a recipe for one hell of a party.

The battle was over
The smoke was clearing
And as legions of Noctises salvaged their loot
The FC exclaimed

It is an early Monday morning, no fantastic drops from that one...


We go on with this for a little while until...


I warp into a belt


*""Tuvan Orth""*.


I can hardly believe it! First a Shadow Serpentis


His first salvo hits me


Second salvo


Third salvo hits. *Half hull left*. I hit Shift+R and hope the drones manage to make it back in time! The ones that don't will have to fend for themselves! I've just remembered there's a officer-free repair-party in station


Fourth salvo hits... My Hurricane turns into another Minmatar ship


""*But this guy is surely worth a lot! I hope someone around here has a ship capable of killing him so this isn't a complete waste!*""


I make an announcement in Alliance for the faction spawn (turns out it's called an officer, there's already 5 Tengu's fighting Orth. Not before long, he explodes and I can uncloak my Hauler. It takes 30 seconds before I can lock onto my own wreck, and I already see a Tengu nibbling on my wreck.


Recover of 9 million in modules + ship insurance


I can see the Alliance chat lights up with all the incredible modules that were looted! Things worth upwards of 10 billion ISK in total - insane! Verb Object is kind enough to remind me I could ask for a finders fee


The response from the looter was somewhat underwhelming though:

""LMAO THIS IS TEST


Slightly sad about the response, but having learned a valuable lesson. This guy went further though, and kept letting me know how much he gained from it, without even a single 'thanks'. :|

I was naïve. I thought all of TEST was filled with the most wonderful people on the planet, and I should be a little more selective. **What happened next was incredible though.**


I may have lost my piece of the cake of an incredible spawn, I had to give my wallet CPR due to it drowning in ISK and I got a new fitted Hurricane and a lovely Shadow Serpentis EANM! I'd love to post the names of everyone who helped me, and who came to the defence of a newbro, they deserve all the love and appreciation from this event! &lt;3


Moral of the story:

1) If you're a newbro in TEST

2) Don't announce officer spawns in Alliance chat, don't let any more innocent Canes die.

2) I'm bad at counting and writing stories from actual events.

3) For every bad apple in TEST

TEST is just the best alliance with the most wonderful people I've ever seen!

1279005553.0,coy9l,"Guide To T2 Frigates: Helping new and old players decide which faction to train, fly, and why. (long and detailed)",KainX,95,88

 My in-game name is Andreya. I played Eve for around 4 years, I cannot fit and fly a battleship all of my frigate related skills are maxed out.. I have spent +90% of my Eve career in T2 frigate and destroyer hulls. Hence why I am writing this guide. Everything in this guide is highly opinionated. I am just speaking from years of heavy PvP experience.

 I find a lot of players wondering which race to train. There is millions of variables in picking your faction

 Each faction has their pros and cons. No faction 'sucks'

 Each ship will have a description. If the description claims the ship is redundant, but cheaper. Keep in mind, Eve is nothing but variables, and situational, and these 'opinions' are just based on my personal experience.

 Lets cut the babble and get to the guide.

 Also Rockets are a weapon system built for frigates, keep in mind, they may suck now, but have huge potential when rockets are fixed. Also, I rarely to never go out to pvp without a MWD on a frigate. 

  Lets get on with it.

---

**Assault Frigates**

* Caldari Harpy: This ship is a Sniper, but shes great in war decs against poor newb corps. The Harpy can be useful to have one in major fleet fights, just one is needed to send every enemy pilot back to a gooey filled clone vat bay. *However*, the Cormorant is a cheap T1 'frigate module classed' ship, shoots around 95% as hard as the Harpy, and just as far. but has 50% better tracking at a fraction of the price! The Harpy does have a higher survivability but i prefer the tracking of the Cormorant. The Harpy simply is not worth the isk/efficiency ratio. If you want blasters, get a ishkur

* Caldari Hawk: Can be fitted with missiles or rockets. the missiles hit like a girl, not an option. skip this AF, grab a T1 kestrel or a crow instead.

* Amarr Vengeance: This is a tanked out rocket platform. She has the potential to become one of the most ruthless annoying little shits in the world when they fix rockets. untill then, and is amazing in T1 frig warfare)

* Amarr Retribution: This ship needs to go die in a fire. it has one mid slot meaning no tackling gear. meaning, or AF is better. Frigates are meant to tackle, so i'd prefer to see a punisher, or a rifter in my gang ovef this failboat. Do *not* fly this ship!

* Minmatar Jaguar: aka the mini Vagabond. The best, and par DPS. Main reason why i favor this ship is because 95% of the ships that *can* catch you, can be killed by you. Everything you can catch, you may not be able to solo kill it, but you will be able to hold it long enough for your friends to kill. Dont screw around with a well piloted Jaguar. he will either kill you, or not be killed by you. either way, it ends up in the Jaguars favor.

* Minmatar Wolf: Meh, you could plug that hole, but at a cost to your damage or mobility. However, the Wolf does hurt a lot. If your in cruiser and above, and the Wolf has a nos, and can tank/kill your drones, and *somehow* managed to get on top of you with an AB

* Gallente Ishkur: This ship will smack the crap out of anything it can land on. Shes packing the highest DPS of the frigs. she has a great slot layout, but the master of *one*’ and that is, breaking faces.

* Gallente Enyo: Decent ship. hits like a brick

 Assault Frigate Summary/Notes: Untill they fix the 'missing bonus' on assault frigates, the Jaguar is an excellent tackler, and the Ishkur will eat your children. 

---

**Interceptors** (there are two types, its usually your own fault. Which, you learn from. If your wanting cheap practice first, grab a T1 Rifter of Vigil to get a feel for it

* Caldari Crow (combat): This is a common all time favorite for good reason, and battleship neuts. A great tackler, but dont expect to tickle too many people to death unless you got a magazine to read.

* Caldari Raptor (tackler): Redundant

* Amarr Crusader (combat): Fastest inty (although it should be the claw) great damage, and very fun to fly

* Amarr Malediction (tackler): This inty has amazing potential, this will be a beast

* Minmatar Claw (combat): Very similar to the Crusader. but your dealing with different firing optimals, it has extremely short lock range, and doesnt shine in any specific aspect anymore than any other intys out there.

* Minmatar Stiletto (tackler): This, is the best tackling inty. Its the only inty with 4 midslots. and thats all that matters. by definition of a proper tackler, the Stiletto takes the cake. If your a new T2 frig pilot, and wanting to help your veteran PvP friends, this is a ship thats usually welcome in any gang.

* Gallente Taranis (combat): One of the most fun intys, and simple battle tactics to live by. however you must pick your targets wisely, and the Ranis is a little slow. pack a nos on this and you can try your luck with larger targets like cruisers because if your neuted in a ranis, your dead. This is one of the few Solo intys that really shine. some crazy kills can be pulled off in one of these. a DCU is often seen as a requirement, is nearly doubles its EHP (effective hit points). A smart, well piloted Ranis can terrorize a system full of carebears. Read Sun Tzu’s the Art of War if you want to master this ship.

* Gallente Ares (tackler): Avoid this

 Interceptor Summary/Notes: Intys are fun, you start with the Interceptors. Each race has a decent inty. but if your wanting to be a true interceptor whos job is to catch targets, get a Stiletto. if you want safe-*ish* mode, get a Crow. If your foolish/brave and want some crazy solo kills, get a Taranis.

1326136033.0,o9mfe,My first solo kill - Does the shaking stop?,Harmswahy,81,9,75,"Last night I got my first ever solo kill after a very quick 25 days here.

I was ratting in 6VDT, ever. I wanted to get a feel for it before wandering to another system.

I'm minding my own business taking on two BS's when suddenly a wild Manticore appeared 20km out. ""SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!"" First thing I do is attempt to warp out. I set my warp out and recall my drones. Suddenly I realize I'm not warping.

BLAM! A rocket hits me and I lose 20% of my shields. I see two more rockets on the way and try to warp again. I then realize that he's got a warp disruptor on me. I'm not getting away...

BLAM! Another rocket hits me

""No nonononono! I can't afford to lose another hurricane! This one is supposed to be paying for the next one!""

I am forced to make a decision. I set my orbit around him at 1000m. I turn on my MWD

BLAM! My shields are blaring in my ear. down to 23%

I'm closing in on him

12km

11km

10km

I activate my guns and score my first hit. 60% of his shields disappear and I realize I have hope. Another hit! he's down to 80% armor. Another hit brings him down farther.

""I'm doing it! I can win this! Take that

Then suddenly he blows up. His pod turned around and warped off. I'm left sitting there

I feel brain dead at this point. ""What just happened? Where am I?""

I return and dock up. Shaking..... Nervous.... Proud.

I know I did a lot wrong to get into this fight

I've been in plenty of fights during my short 25 days here

Originally i was gonna go with something alittle more elaborate

After extensive research on youtube i used some groundwire to fleshout some kind of frame and wrapped it up in tinfoil [LIKE SO](http://i.imgur.com/HZTpo.jpg).  Then proceded to layer it up with clay.  I have to admit though.  This whole thing took several hours and for the first half of this time i thought to myself more than once ""Maybe they'll pity me...""  But i pushed on with a healthy dose of resolve and stubbornness and slowly something half decent started to show itself outlined [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/jpKUE.jpg).

At this point i thought it was done and was quite satisfied with the results but then i remembered reptiles have scaly skin so out of sheer curiousity i started picking at it figuring i could just smooth it out if i screwed up as it was still quite wet.  But again i surprised myself with what happened and threw caution to the wind as i started carve into it like i knew what i was doing and turned [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/O6Z9i.jpg) into [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ZtnUa.jpg) ending with [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/N8IJq.jpg).

Again i thoguht i was done.  Though over the next few days i would take some time to clean it up and smooth it out leaving me with [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/5UVyv.jpg).

This is where i knew i could screw things up now.  While i could copy drawings fairly well with decent accuracy in highschool

To be honest i really shocked myself with this thing and am quite proud that i actually pulled this off.  So irregardless of being accepted i have to thank you guys for letting me know i could do this.  Just a week ago i would have laughed if i was told i could.

So next time i run into a blob of reds by myself i can look up to [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/b9DFq.jpg) and think i have a chance of surviving... then get blown up :D",self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/11j9v0/arts_crafts_clay_mmd_scuplture/

Current Intel and Analysis

17-08-2011


As evidence has continued to show from a fight a few nights ago and other actions taken by Gonnswarm Federation and Test Alliance Please Ignore. It now seems certain that GSF and TEST have agreements with the DRF to assist in the taking of Delve and Querious for their own purposes. They consistantly were late to aid NC forces when the DRF was invading the north and often found excuses not to come in at all. Sources i have found inside of GSF and TEST have confirmed that they are actively in contact with Nothern Coalition.


This is part of an extended plan by the DRF to take over all of null sec before October 2011. The DRF are aiming to holkd all the null sec space they can by that time so that their reliance on Super Capitals will not cause an total colapse of their comabt capability. It has eben noted on many ocasions that the DRF and their extended alliances power base seem to have no ability to run support gangs. They continue to depend upon the power of the super capitals in all engagements even if they are deployed or not. They are starting to recongive that this percieved threat wiull be going away in Octover and thus are aiming for total dominance now.


White Noise


Evoke and Ewoks were sent to Delve as a distraction force against the allies of -A-. They did not expect to have Morsus Mihi and Brick Squad all but abandon their assault on Nulli Secunda and TEST pet alliances in favor of attacking the Evoke infrastructure and fleet logistics. Evoke was not prepared to deal with an extended engagement with RAWR and BR1CK. As a result Evoke has made an extended effort to deal with RAWR and BR1CK and has cost them a good portion of their fighting force. As a result forces that were slated for operations against -A- have been moved to deal with the growing issue in Delve. Evoke has been unable to distract the forces of -A- away from the DRF as a result of major action with RAWR and BR1CK.


GSF and TEST had already staed their inbtrest in taking back Delve from the invaders and have been in contact with NC. and Evoke to facilitate this. AS a result there appears to be an agreement for coioperative action in Delve between the Decline Colaition and the DRF. In addition Raiden has placed supers in low sec within jump range of 1DH-SX. Raiden has brought all but about 150 supers down from the north and placed them in either HED or in low sec. NC. and Evoke are doing the same. At last check GSF and TEST are moving a large quantity of super capitals and material power. The direction is assumed to be Delve.


As it stands the DRF appear to have an agreement with DC for the final dividing of the last free areas of null sec. They are stagiong to put this plan into action and are aiming to completely own all avaliable space in eve by the begining of October. DRF view the remaining alliences not under their control as bumps in the road. It should be noted that atleast 5 of the major players in the DRF are running major defficates to make sure that they conquest all of eve. Their logistics trains and the lack of major market movement because they have pushed all the major buyers oout is causing them to not have the equity they are neededing to keep the war machine running.


DRF are betting that they have all the power needed to over run the rest of eve and hold it until to sov and super capital changes that are slated to come. they are quickly realizing that they are sevierly lacking in a good and consistent tactical doctrine that will allow them to fight on eve grounds with their enemies. Instead of adressing this they are just bguilding mroe super capitals and depending on the likes of Evoke


Pandemic Legion has gone mostly inactive. Most of their memeber have not logged because they are not enjoying the game anymore. Many of the members are now regretting the action they took in siding with the DRF and destroying what many of themsaw as a consistent and fun place to get fight (Northern Coalition Territory) and now that they are on a perminant retainter with the DRF they see the extremelly low risk and extremelly low effort PvP as more boaring then anything. Shadoo has not been logging on consistantly for the past 3 weeks and many other members of the leadership team seem to be inactive. At this point it is doubtful that if the DRF call them


DRF are aiming to take Providence as of right now. This is aimed at completely cutting off all normal acess to empire for -A- and Stain Wagon. They have assigned this task to NC. and Raiden. Starting this weekend the DRF will start to mass seige -A- space and try to break all will from -A- in one massive assault. This assault will be putting a massive strain on the DRF and they are depending on iontimidation rather then force to keep -A- quiet. They are looking at a time table fo the total destruction of -A- to be completed by the first of september. Or at least be far enough along to not make a difference. Disaster for them would be if their assault stalls for whatever reason.


CCP have staed to many that if the DRF as a whole manage to take over most of null sect to the point that no other force would be allowed in without their saying then drastic changes will occure.

Good evening

If you read this forum

Many of you know me, a college junior going for a comp. science degree. I've been a Redditor for about a year and a half, I've played EVE for almost 3 years now off and on, and I joined Dreddit in April last year. I've been helping new players for about 10 months, I've been the head mentor in TEST for about 4.
Oh and I should back up a step and say my finals are next week

]Why a Dreddit CEO?

A few reasons. Some people - like me - think Dreddit needs our own leader to take care of the corp. In the past the Dreddit CEO has always been the alliance executor
My job is to look after the needs of the corporation
I will retain whatever position I had in the alliance training department; however

I've been reading through various posts in this board and others, and I've discussed a few things in private with certain people. I've seen a lot of suggestions for things that need to be changed, implemented, removed, etc. I have taken note of as many as I can manage (literally... written them down by hand. I have more handwritten notes for EVE than school).I have been, and will be, contacting people both in private and on the forums for more ideas and help in better developing them. I don't want to make closed private decisions all on my own

Speaking of Reddit, but for now we'll continue using the forums for anything that needs to stay private. For starters, I'm crossposting this to the subreddit and I'll do an AMA for you guys as well :D. I will post here or send an in-game mail whenever I do something important on the subreddit, but I would like to see the continued and possibly expanded usage of /r/evedreddit. I'm really happy to load up the board and see posts that AREN'T about ""hay i want to join the corp brup brup brup,"" and I would love to see more activity there still. 

One last concern that I'll address right now is the approachability of leadership. Again, suggestion, question, whatever - feel free to talk to me. You can reach me on the forums in a PM, on Jabber most of the time, or by in-game mail. Granted, I do have finals next week, get in touch with me if you ever have anything important (or unimportant!) you want to talk about. I still actually log into EVE when I have time

We've got several issues with this

* Name similarity

Our names are very close to each other, not _because of the Reddit post_. 

In addition to this

**Update**: [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/iltzf/would_anyone_be_interested_in_forming_a_reddit/c24uny0) appears to be the start of them using the name of Test

* Logo issue

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/evedreddit/comments/1339ls/sorry_to_drop_by_dreddit_but_can_someone_inform/) popped up asking for the artist of the Honey Badger Coalition logo. No leadership was contacted prior to this post and the post wasn't directed at leadership. Artists absolutely own the rights to any work they do

In addition to this the poster claims he found the image while searching on Google for 'reddit'. I call bullshit. Go try it

* Art asset usage

Early on they were using a number of art assets very similar to some of our propaganda

* The [TEST] tag

Test Outfit Please Ignore grabbed the [TEST] tag before we could reserve it for ourselves. This has already created confusion for our newbies getting into the game. We are currently in a different outfit in combination with PL and others

* Moderator censorship

Moderators are basically deleting and hiding any discussion of issues on the /r/testoutfit subreddit

* Arrogance

Nothing seems to set our organization off more than dealing with arrogance or elitism. A lot of the posts by the Test Outfit guys are along the lines of ""We are bigger then you in Planetside 2

I look for open fleets in the finder window because that's what boodabooda told me to do when I was crying of boredom in deedee. I see an interesting fleet lead by horrorgun [Dr_Sandvich]. The title says ""RESCUE MISSION. EXPECT TO DIE"" and the description further read ""Johnathan Alabel has some ships in C3X. We are attempting to rescue them. You will most likely die""

I'm pretty used to dying by now, but welcomed nonetheless. They were already 5 jumps ahead of me so I had to play some catch up. They were awesomely patient for me, I must have asked ""where do I go?/where are you guys?"" at least 5 times. When I finally catch up, they tell me to head straight for the station and accept the contract from Johnathan so that I can fly the ship home. The entire time, Beef Cubes (I think?) was near shitting his pants at the warp gate making sure all was clear. The others waiting for me at the station were joking about spamming trade windows with the reds or something. I dock and accept the contract... but low and behold, I don't have the skills yet to be able to fly the damn ship he gave me. I let them know that on coms.

*""hey ummm... I can't fly this...""*

""JE-SUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!""

""WHAT THE BLOODY HELL!!"" *beef cubes your voice is awesome btw*

""YOU CAN'T FLY THAT?!?!""

""WE'RE SO FUCKED! WHAT DO WE DO NOW?""

""JUST LEAVE IT HERE!!""

""NO

*""guys im so sorry I told you I was new D: D: D:""*

""CAN YOU FLY ANY OF THESE?!? - *lists a few ships* ""

*""ummm that one!"" I picked out a small Incursus*

""FINE. HERE! FUCKING HELL!""

And so it was. On the FC's command we all zerg'd out of the station and flew to the safe spot before getting the all clear from B-cubes at the stargate. The entire trip back, and plenty of lemming jumps. But somehow we miraculously made it back in one piece. No casualties. We even scored some 'rat kills along the way (I got to use the sweet T2 shit on what I was flying. The power!!!) When we got to the station, we all had a laugh about how rag-tag it was and how it somehow worked out ok. I contracted the Incursus back to Johnathan, and he thanked us all with a 10mil donation. 

me: ""wow thanks! you doubled my isk!!""

everyone else: ""...wait what? doubled? how much do you have...?""

me: ""no really

everyone: ""TAKE A FUCKING SCREENSHOT OF YOUR WALLET AND SHOW US HOW MUCH YOU HAVE!""

me: ""[ummm.... D:](http://i.imgur.com/LtXRj.jpg)"" *at that point only Johnathan knew how much I had because he knew how much ""doubled"" was*

10 seconds later

me: ""[JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!! WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO WITH THIS MUCH MONEY???](http://i.imgur.com/4RmC6.jpg)""

They had effectively increased my isk by 2500%... I still have no idea what a noob does with this kind of money. This was the shit that I read about in forums about ""hero"" noobs getting showed in isk and having no clue what to do. I am living the dream right now. The whole time I was spazzing out in coms about wtf do I do with all this, we play this game for fun, and this is what it's all about: doing stupid shit with a group of strangers and having an awesome time. Enjoy it! Spend it on whatever you want! Just remember to pass it on when you see someone in the same position as you were :)""

I'm excited about the wardec. Are you? If not

Since we do not have a military director

For those of you who have never been in a war before, we're not doing much else besides roaming gank operations anyway, so here's what we ask of you - and if you do it, I promise you we will have more fun than they will.

1) Get mumble. Join the mumble server. If you're unclear on how to do this, I don't need to hear you, but I _NEED_ you to hear me.

2) Take some time today and prepare a few ships. These will be the ships that you will fly over the course of the next week or so. I know, and a lot of you like hauling. Now, however, you're combat pilots. Here's what you need: a t1 frigate with a couple of guns, a warp disrupter (not scrambler), and an afterburner. The rest is up to you. Even if you can, do not put t2 guns on it. Buy the cheapest modules you can find. Make a bunch of these outfits and stash them in a whole bunch of nearby stations. If you're having trouble funding this because you're new

3) Once the war goes hot, and that can be taken care of outside the game. To reiterate: This is going to be a lot more fun for us than it is for them. It isn't fun to blow up frigates. It especially isn't fun to blow up frigates if you're losing battleships in the process. All operations online will be fleet operations where we hunt war targets. We will lose ships. We will lose some money. We will be drunk.

And that's pretty much it. The rest writes itself. Never talk in local

*Edit*

So

Day 1: Set up a mediclone in CS- and used the ""pod express"" for the first time by visiting the gorgeous Amarrian nebula from Paye and self-destructing on my way to the star. Flew in a whelp cane fleet after using our free ships program to get a Rifter. :3 

I've flown in small gangs before, and scimitars was amazing. I'll never forget how significant I felt playing a small but vital role in a fleet like that - I was in complete awe when we pulled up to an Erebus.

I started snapping screenshots like none other

I realized how important we must be to defend that Titan - especially after the nerf and whatnot

---

Day 2: 

Flew around with some camping fleet for a few minutes until my game shat on me - logged back in four hours later and flew in the Maelstrom strategic fleet to take out a few POS's - we encountered a fleet of Against All Authority Tengus along the way, and I saw a cyno light up - and then all of the sudden there's an Avatar, Erebus, and Leviathan right on top of us. Got some more glorious FRAPS footage. Gathered 22 corpses, both friendly and enemies, alike.

A guy piloting a maelstrom contacted me during the fight and said he knew my face from a lowsec system in Amarrian space - reminding me of the time I called him ""dishonourable"" for gatecamping me. We had a good laugh and got back to shooting Tengu pilots, and we blew the shit out of them. 

I also found an old Goonswarm friend - the guy who met me in my first few hours playing near Pator [with a tengu] - gave me a few million isk, and he's since moved on to TNT. I bumped into him outside the CS- station and we shot eachother for a while.


---

Day 2/3:

Set up my mediclone in 6VDT after the strategic op [around 2 AM] and pod-expressed to Fountain. Beautiful system

I set up a jump clone in Fountain by jumping my consciousness to Foves [deep Caldari space

Currently sitting in Paye

1266276204.0,b2g9w,Q&amp;A with FTV,skrunkle,82,24,121,"Greetings redditors. My name in eve is skrunkle. I am one of the executors of the Fear th3 Vampires alliance. We have been auditing these forums ever since Haskuldr First popped dotblank in alparena. And I have decided to offer you all a chance to talk to one of us in your own environment.

Let me start off by saying that I will probably not respond to trolls or flames. My intention here is only to correct the record on a few misconceptions you all might have about Eve-online in general or FTV specifically.

The first thing I think you all need to know about FTV specifically (and I think you will find this applies in a very general way to most of the people you will come across in eve) is that we are not player haters. We did not start this war out of any sort of animosity towards dreddit or redditors. (in fact reddit.com is a web site that many of us were already familiar with.) We declared war only because you represent many very soft targets. I noticed a post early on after we war deced. The commenter declared that this must be an eve record for time from corp creation to war dec. If that is true

The next thing I would like to mention is your constant references to the gloom puppy movie ""Twilight"". I have never seen nor will I ever watch that schlok. The Fear the Vampires name is over 10 years old and represents a gaming group that has played together in many games across the internet. I cannot answer why that name was chosen because I was not a part of the group when this name was first applied. But I have been playing under the FTV tag in one game or another for years before Twilight so your Edward references go right over my head. :)

Another post that I would like to adress is a post that talked about the FTV killboard having skewed numbers regarding the value of pods. This post claimed that pods are not worth 10 million. and that the total value of the pods should be removed from our efficiency numbers. That commenter is right and wrong in the same breath. The truth is that most of the time pods are worth ALOT MORE than 10 million ISK. Now before all you trial account players start saying that YOUR PODS cost you NOTHING, considering that in certain cases it's not unheard of for an advanced highly skilled clone to have over 2 billion credits in implants. So relish this time where your pods cost you nothing as this will change quickly once you start progressing in the game.

Next we need to talk about money a bit. The amount of money that any of my main toons is capable of making in eve as opposed to the amount of ISK a trial account toon is capable of bringing in is exponentially different. So when you talk about making this war hurt us because we lost a fully TII fitted and rigged battleship, and if you all stick with the game long enough you will find that money will come easily and quickly once you have some piloting skills.

The last thing I would like to address before I leave this to commenter questions (which I will try to respond to as long as you are not asking about things that we consider to be secrets while we are at war.) Is that even though we should be able to converse about this in a friendly manner here don't go thinking that somehow I won't still kill you when I see you on grid in eve. :)

1360921941.0,18kp3a,[Arts &amp; Crafts] A custom Dreddit satchel bag,KamaKaZzie,62,11,30,"The Dreddit Bag. (pic gallery at the bottom)


When I first conceived the idea to produce this bag I saw it as a way into Dreddit
Unfortunately the lack of time in EVE is still an issue



Back to the bag.


My first thought was to get the highest resolution images I could of the MMD and the Dreddit logo



The Process. 

I did the Dreddit logo first by taking a tracing directly from the screen of my laptop (not usually the best idea, again the detail made it a slow process. In the end I am pleased with the results, I do not do very much carving or stamping so I was a little concerned how it would turn out.

The MMD was, I started by tracing each line of the image, including the various areas of shading and detail. Once satisfied the tracing was taped to the leather (cased) and imprinted by running a ball point pen carefully over the tracing. Corrections and additions were then made where I had missed areas or the lines did not “look” right.

The outline was then carved with the swivel knife

The fun part!
Dyeing the leather! What fun I had with this! The first idea was simply to dilute some black dye with methanol to the desired shade, but at the same price as a month in EVE (before postage) for a 200ml bottle I was a little put off. The solution turned out to be a 100ml bottle of Kiwi White Sports Shoe dressing. This white paint type liquid was then tinted with black leather dye (Note: It doesn’t like to mix with alcohol based dyes) until I had the shades I desired.


Production times (approximate)… 

Research ran to about 3 hours, about the same for the MMD, dying the rest of the bag including using vinegarroon to blacken the strap another 3 hours. Assembly and finishing… 5 hours. 

For a nasty total of approximately 21 hours


The entire bag and hardware is hand stitched with 0.8mm braided polyester thread that has been waxed with bees wax. The final finish is done with Fiebings Resolene acrylic finish.

I hope you enjoyed this write up as much as I enjoyed the challenge of producing the bag.

They ended up loving our ridiculous fleets and just as we got settled, the HBC died, and Sort dragon demanded our space for his little power tri... Alliance. As the only PVP corp in our alliance, we could not mount a defence, and so we were forced out. Our alliance invited us to go join them with S3N but we felt our loyalties lie with TEST and friends

Since then this war with goons has started

Our very existence is seen as stupid, where they feel we'll be the victims of harassment. The eve community simply hates us because we're a group they don't approve of.:P There's mad all around us but despite it all we've persisted, shown our teeth and fought our way to success and became the ones harassing, not the ones being harassed. 

We have few allies in the game, but the alliance we've been paired with is kind of serious business, and spent their time getting mad at our newbros, which we refuse to leave behind for any reason. (What good is a corp without a cuddly newbro or two?) 

Basically, moons, or space/outposts. We just want spots in your fleets so we don't have to spend the rest of our time in game isolated from the rest of our community in dreddit by silly internet spaceship lines.:P I'm hoping by maybe getting some support from you guys on the subreddit we might get leadership's attention on the matter.

Short version:

* RA moving to Delve, but that wouldn't change a thing as they would still get stomped, so they want a new, fresh start.

* They want to raise their combat skill and morale so they need softer opponents - that's why Delve is so great apparently. They also want to change the alliance focus to be a NC./PL-style PvP alliance.

* In the end some guy (sounds important) admits that he signed the alliance's death warrant by getting involved in the MACTEP (SOLAR) vs xXDEATHXx war and that is why they are getting destroyed now.

First of all

Salvaging is going to be your new friend. You and salvaging will become the very dearest and bestest of BFF's in all of fake internet space. And this is how I made 100 million ISK in 30 days and if you actually put in some effort

No

Joining channel noob_salvage is a great start

Since we're new we'll have a Thrasher to salvage in. She's a good ship too (and free in test_free) but she isn't very tough so you don't want to wander too far from home alone. But that's okay too.

&gt; ""But I'm so new I don't know where anything is! How do I even know where to go?""

**[GARPA](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/GARPA_Topographical_Survey)**. That's how (click that link to the .zip file). 

You already have [EveMon](http://evemon.battleclinic.com/) to track your training and plan your skills, **really** helpful since ALT-TABing means you have to leave the game screen).

Install GARPA now.

Next, Status, Owner, etc, just everything *in the table itself* below that header). Highlighted? Good. Now copy it to your clipboard.

**EDIT : Just go to the page with the jump bridge list, xik)**

Now

GARPA has now copied the contents of that table into the program and you now have all our jump bridges. Close the window. Remember to keep the list up to date by repeating all those steps when the jump bridge list wiki page that I linked above changes. I check every single day before I load GARPA.

&gt; ""Okay

Find 6VDT-H in the map - it's all the way over to the left in Fountain. We are out in the sticks it seems

So now when someone posts in noob_salvage that they have salvage in DBRN-Z you don't have to make 6 jumps. You can just make 2 easy ones.

To use a jump bridge (JB)

Oh

So let's plot a route right now. Find 6VDT-H on the map in GARPA. Now click it on the map itself (that's the giant space on the left). Now

Okay

Great. Now press ""Find route"" (it's just above ""routing options"").

&gt; ""Cool! It's all highlighted on my map!! But

See the column that's labeled ""P-M""? That mean Planet - Moon. That means that when you warp to NDH-NV from 6V you need to warp to Planet 3 Moon 1 (according to this particular example). Once you get there you will see the JB! 

&gt; ""Awesome. Uh

Ozone is the fuel the JB uses. Don't worry about that right now

But wait

When noob_salvage is a ghost town, you can use your ships scanner to find your own stuff.

&gt; ""Scanner""?

Yep

Go to

Now fly back to 6V

OK, open people and places and do another scan. Have any of the anomalies you listed in your bookmarks not shown up in this new scan? Yes?! Awesome!! - that means someone probably ratted that one and that's why it no longer comes up on your scan. Now, change the titles of your BM's to add in a note to all the possible anomalies that might be salvageable and then warp to within 70-100km of each one on your list. 

At this point you wanna be a little cautious. If all the wrecks show up as white triangles

Remember, that's bad even by my low pun standards).

**EDIT : Also

* Blue - abandoned
* White - you and your corp can loot
* Yellow - someone else - if you loot it

 This is day 14 on eve for me also . Right when i joined test was when i moved out of highsec/faction warfare space. This wasn't highsec anymore. I was in a different world. I undock from our main station with my little rifter and i see this FLEET. OF DRAKES, away. It was amazing. WHAT THE FUCK DID THEY JUST DO.

I go to the forums

 so i go join a fleet, and join up with this 14 man fleet. I have no clue how any mechanics work, but i remember them being ""Raycats"" and seeing all these drakes. I listen, keep quiet, and just align/jump to where im supposed to. We go fly around for a bit and have our Scout who was baked out of his mind go look for shit. 

So we finally find one place to get some fights goin. I'm this little speck of a rifter inside this fleet of drakes (someone brung a hyperion too). We have 14 of us around this gate waiting. Suddenly we see 2 or 3 -a- jump in, then more oracles, and i blast my microwarpdrive not knowing what else to do but approach what the FC called out and hit my scrambler before i die. 

Suddenly 20-30 oracles jump on in, and watch as all these drakes drop in seconds. 20 seconds after we started we're all blapped.

So we all laugh about it in coms and i understand the meaning of ""fucking blobbed"". so everyones leaving, i'm okay i can make it myself and then i look into my wallet, see 100M. If that isn't icing ontop of the cake. Holy shit.    

My first real time in a fleet i flew around and got completly anihlated in the worst way possible

Thank you all for making me love this game now haha

UPDATE: so apparently after our fleet got blobbed, go off to fight and be space raped, then know those guys murdered for your vengeance.

On top of insomnia

Well, paired with my Trazodone for sleep, gives me some really lucid and oftentimes fucked up dreams.

Last night I dreamed I was my pod pilot, shooting at a fleet consisting of UAxDeath and a few other people. All of a sudden we got dropped.

Titans as far as the eye could see. I could feel the terror one would feel in that situation. Not like, but as if I were **actually there**. Shit was scary, as we got bubbled by some dictors and locked down and ransomed. Why they were ransoming assfrigs IDK, but all of a sudden a friendly covops decloaked a few hundred km away, and lit a cyno.

Durr, Beffah, Dingo, and every other ""VIP"" in TEST came to our aide along with hundreds of drakes and capitals.

The fight was glorious. Titan DD's were going off every other second, cynos were flashing in and out of existence. The biggest fleet battle I have ever seen in or out of EVE or YouTube videos, and no TiDi. Fweddit came in and reinforced us. -A- bridged in to help UAxDeath. 

It all finally ended when Bombers Bar came into local. Makalu ran

Bridged back to 6VDT

I got my first kill. Yes.

So I'm flying to meet up with the fleet to farm some tears with them in my first fleet op. As I drop out of warp and approach the gate, but a sudden calm comes over me. I say to myself, ""To hell with this...I'm in a tackle rifter, I'm gonna tackle shit."" I return lock, hit my MWD, and get in his face. I start up my nosferatu, orbit at 1000m, and web + scramble him. All of a sudden

Well, and tackled. Simple enough.

But I understand my role now. I'm small

I jump into Corp chat and let Dreddit know about my wonderful experience. Two seconds later

I learned a ton those first few days

I took part in my first fleet and was 100% lost. I had a hard time following the terminology about what direction we were going. (Oh, mostly just running around, learning. At this point, I had been salvaging enough that I had learned to navigate pretty well, including utilizing jump bridges. I had been relying on TEST_FREE, so I had extra ships.

Last night though, determined to actually contribute. 

I joined up on mumble after seeing the ping on jabber

Eventually, you guys should get over here."" Next thing you know its an all out battle. I moved away and set up a few perches 300k from the gate so that the fleet could warp out to me if needed. Hearing the FC say ""align to nathan, warp to nathan"" was awesome. 

Eventually reinforcements showed up. I stop bouncing around and burned in close, and we stand victorious. 

I grab what little loot I was fast enough to get my hands on. Everyone heads back to NOL. I mention on mumble that it was my first time scouting and my first killmail

Here is an album of me putting it together &amp; testing the various parts:

[Lots of JabberPi](http://imgur.com/a/vmwkA)



**How it works:**

1. A message is sent to the Raspberry's jabber account
2. A python script running on the Raspberry receives the message
3. If the message contains the word ""fleet"" it then gets sent to the LCD panel using a custom Python library (Note - If you buy the SainSmart 2004 LCD panel to use with a Pi
4. Additionally
5. The MOSFET connects the 12V power to the LEDs and leaves them on for 3 seconds
6. The python script returns to monitoring Jabber messages



The biggest challenge in making this was dealing with the voltages that the Raspberry Pi provides and aligning them with those required by the LCD screen &amp; LEDs. All the logic on the Pi runs at 3.3V but the screen runs at 5V and the LEDs run at 12V. Additionally

Well, I made myself ready.  Sold off my meager assets, jumped into a blank clone that was NOT in Jita, and stayed logged in, waiting.

Next morning, right?

Then last night, and away I was!

Upon jumping into Mumble and local, and it was time to suicide a fleet in it's place.

I was excited - but not having a ship ready and not knowing what the local market would be like

We went a bunch of jumps looking for targets and eventually found a gang of Tengus (Tengii?)...who seemed to primary me first!

I went down in a ball of flames

I decided to take advantage of the reimbursement that NOS is doing and formed a 5 man gang of newbros, and caught a Retribution. 1 kill down. We then continued on our way, getting caught once in a bubble that was luckily not manned. At 1DH we got 3 more kills when a Thrasher and 3 Rifters jumped on to us, we killed the Rifters, but the Thrasher burned out of point and warped off with 10% structure left. At 1DH we got some more people in the fleet and went out on a short, fiery roam. I volunteered to FC because we didn't have anyone that had done it before (neither had I), and we found a VC AHAC fleet twice our size in about 4 jumps. I died, but everyone else made it back alright.

1329752508.0,pxv3h,Went on my first op last night. Now I have many questions.,wildfyre010,48,1,25,"Op redux:

1. Got lost after the first jump. Didn't know about jump bridges.

2. Looked up the jump bridge map on the wiki. Didn't know how to find the bridges if I didn't already have them bookmarked. Turns out jump bridges are near a moon and the map lists the moons. Used the 'All' setting on my overview to find the moons until I realize I can right-click on the starfield and warp to them that way.

3. Sheepishly asked in Mumble for a current system location

4. Eventually caught up with the fleet

5. When the SBU is just about to start taking structure damage, by the way. First op, I see a Titan? Sadly, we didn't end up doing anything with it except jumping back out to the system where the SBU from earlier was still floating.

6. Everyone's shooting the SBU, I figure my overview is fucked because those can't possibly be bad guys because they're less than 80 km away and we brought a big ass fleet out here. Surely we would go and kill them if they were hostile?

7. So my Rifter is flying over that way and some people on Mumble are laughing at the hero rifter. I get close to these three ships and something shoots at me. Oh shit. Pop the afterburner and run back towards the aHAC light show (also

So

- How do I get jump bridges to show up in my overview

- When the FC talks about a primary

First of all

I had only been in game a few days when I signed up for Dreddit and now I'm in low-sec with 23 days left on my [30 day skill plan](http://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/30_day_plan) to get through. What that means

However

Last night I joined a fleet and though I spent half the time just catching up to everyone (thanks to some help from a very patient and helpful player), as everyone donated ISK to me (not to mention the insurance on my Rifter) and so now I have at least plenty of money to keep me in paper ships that blow up instantly. 

Also, for sure).

Still though

The rest of my time I've spent reading guides that are pure information overload and though they are written to help new players

Overall though, salvaging when those opportunities arise, training skills - and then move up into something that will allow me to rat and at least get some combat experience against NPC's so I'll feel more comfortable in real PvP combat.

So, but I have learned a lot already and I really want to improve so I paid for a full account and will keep at this.

This is going to be big.

There are a few things we need to address

1) There are instructions in this subreddit on how to join the corp. Private messaging me in game is actually detrimental to getting anything done... as I've been logging on

2) On that note, we can count on level 4. I'm seeing that this is going to be bigger than I originally anticipated, and am skilling my damndest to accomodate.

3) There are standing orders in EVE Mail. It's got a system I recommend the older players to group up at (and the newer players can group up nearby in the high sec systems.)

4) About the Corp HQ: Once the board of directors is established, I've got the corp management skills to at least get us off the ground. I'm taking suggestions on how to fill the corp management director roles, but essentially I'd like established players who demonstrate a good knowledge of each of the areas we're specializing in. As a result, this MIGHT lead to a little less than a democratic vote, but if there is public outcry demanding we put it to a vote, that's for reddit to decide (I would fully recommend that we simply appoint the people best suited to the jobs however).

5) Please keep this in mind: This is going to be a clusterfuck for a couple of weeks. A lot of you new players will get pretty dismayed by the lack of organization, it will just take time. This gives the new players a chance to learn what they want to do in EVE, and the veterans a chance to learn each other's strengths and weaknesses.

6) I want to thank everyone for their immediate action. I truly am sorry about the member cap issue that we're currently having, browsing the boards as always. I look forward to your input.

Fast forward a few months and suddenly the entire alliance is turned on its head before me. I sat and watched from the safety of ""home"" as we reset Goons and ditched the HBC while Fountain's invaders grow more and more numerous each day. Of course, I was happy with what we had in Fountain and figured it'd be so much easier to defend anyways. I even joined a local jewing/PVP squad to help reach that goal, slowly gaining more and more experience in player combat but never understanding why nobody else seemed to share my views.

When the first defensive stratop of 1-SMEB came along I told myself I would leave my comfort zone, left me ill-prepared to fly any doctrine ship, so I hopped into a tackle frigate and joined the n00b fleet. Needless to say being a perch for targeted logibros to warp to was boring as shit, watching from afar, listening to the FC try to coordinate tackle frigates, interdictors, ECMs

Well over a hundred battleships come and gone in a multitude of beautiful explosions, we all could've just said ""fuck it!"" and done something else. But here we were, over **sixteen hundred** people, sitting there playing internet spaceships, each with a vital role to fill no matter how mundane it may seem... we were each making more of a difference than any amount of taxes ever could.

The second half of the 1-SMEB campaign only served to reinforce that feeling of accomplishment and helped me understand the need for conquest, even if it's against those whom we used to name 'friend'! To call it exhilarating would be a grave understatement, and I now know that I belong to something so much bigger than just one ship doing one profession in one corporation. It takes so much organization to get this gaggle of drunken, sleep-deprived nerds to come together, but when they do not even the combined efforts of the Goons, TNT, NC., and whatever other organization that tries to take our playground away from us can do so.

Though my heart will always lie in Fountain I am now more than excited to pledge what free time and resources I have to helping TEST retain both regions of space. And for those of you ever wishing to come visit, and I'll keep a light on for you. o7",,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,

I used to make and launch these rockets from kits when I was younger and even mix and match pre-made parts

I took a look at all the spare parts I had, I did not know if this would launch properly due to both engines not firing at the same time.  Due to this I decided to go with a single rocket model which presented a new problem.  With a single engine, I had to have this balanced in the center of the rocket.  With the Rifter, the cockpit is fairly small, but if I made this to scale, then I would have no room for the engine plus enough room for a parachute.  Because of this I decided to make the body larger.

Here are some pictures of the work and assembly process of the rocket:

[Launch 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CougjNlr-Ps&amp;feature=plcp)

After the first launch I decided to just stick the biggest engine I had left and see what would happen.  I really had no hope for this launch.  It's quite funny how a lack of stabilizers makes a big difference

Around the fall of 2010 TEST caught my eye, and I wanted to. I wasn't going to go for ""Elite PVP"" (I am not good enough at the game), I wasn't really a ""goon"" - although I respect what they do and laugh with them (and occasionally at them), and I'm not Russian. I'd been on the wrong side of fighting the NC enough times that I wasn't going to join that sinking ship, and as I wandered aimlessly throughout EVE, I found the source of TEST (and by extension Dreddit) - reddit. I started reading, posting, which led me to the opportunity to join Dreddit a few months later.

I then combined everything to create the battle report: [album](http://imgur.com/a/217Yi) and [animated gif](http://imgur.com/MgDpR).

I also reenacted the battle in pasta form: [album](http://imgur.com/a/dfhwM). You can see the glorious macaroni victorious over the vile gomiti.

Our wise, clever eh?) and Dreddit/TEST at large to answer.

Here's out charter

**TEST's Antitrust Squad**
*Mission*

Do you enjoy Industry? Do you find more satisfaction in a fat wallet than a well-equipped HAC? Does a smoothly operating production line make you spooge like a schoolgirl? Does the idea of a multi-hour mining op send you for two fingers of scotch

Then Antitrust Squad may be for you! Antitrust’s mission is to provide you with a place to hone your industrial chops amongst like-minded robber barons like the latter day Croesus

Antitrust may not be for you if you think mining is boring in a bad way

Antitrust is looking for Miners, Industrial Pilots, Salvagers, Refiners, mineral compressors and importers, and all sub-genres that make up the isk side of EVE.

*Member service goals:*

* Provide TEST with a ready source of industrial know-how and willing participants for logistics operations in the maintenance and expansion of the glorious industrialist Mecca known as Fountain.
* A place to find and connect with like-minded players to engage in the ancient art of natural resource exploitation. Be it Rock, Gas or Moongoo we want to use it to our own ends: Antitrust is Scrooge, Fountain is our fortune, TEST is our Moneybin.
* A mature environment where trolling and flaming are frowned upon
* A forum and sticky posts and sources built and maintained to place want ads

What you should bring to Antitrust:

* A desire to learn about and participate in Industry
* A willingness to share your expertise, mentoring, and Antitrust in-game channel help.
* Antitrust does not have a wealth

*Administration*

Squad Administrative crap: Squad will be run primarily on the initiative of its members; it is your job to see we succeed. I intend to act as supreme squad dictator to start off, and/or appointment in as laid-back manner as possible. Think of it as a little island of direct democracy in a sea of communism.


Who we need:

* YOU
* Players with significant industrial experience who would be interested in serving as officers.
* A Wikipedia guru
* Moderators to help organize the (eventual) squad sub-forum.
* People who want to find people to work together with in ISK acquisition activies.
* People who are still reading this.
* YOU

*This change will only effect those that got into Dreddit via a recommendation from someone else.* If you were recommended in

**Why?**

It basically means that everyone getting in directly knows someone who is an active redditor.

**Who decides if we are an ""active redditor""?**

The HR Drone looking at your application. It is basically exactly the same as if you are applying to Dreddit without a application. We will go through the same process.

**OMG I'm going to be kicked!!!!**

No, no, no. If you were recommended into the corp you are still under no obligation to become an active redditor, and you won't be ""purged"". You simply won't be able to recommend others in.

After talking with a few EVE veterans last night in game, would be preferable to a complete democracy which would be slow to act, and would often take into account some real wackadoo ideas. Looking at it critically, I believe the five director positions we need are as follows:

* Military Director
* Industrial Director
* Training Director
* Economic Director
* Political Director

Although I feel the roles are fairly self-describing

*Military Director* - The military director is the supreme commander of our PVP forces. His/Her decision is final when it comes to matters military. This includes running conquest campaigns, etc. Any concerns you have regarding the direction of the corp on a military level will need to be put through the proper channels to arrive at the MD's ears.

*Industrial Director* - The ID will organize all things industry. They will largely be in charge of any industrial POS's that need to be put in position, and be the one to finally drop the axe on when it's time to start cranking out capital ships. They are the ultimate strategic mind in running the supply chain. Often, they will need to coordinate with the MD in order to secure their operations.

*Training Director* - The TD will be our head of PVE operations. It is no secret that we have a lot of people who are new to the game. The Training Director will not only help to set up classes involving how to play the game, exploration, and small pvp learning skirmishes. Essentially, everything that does not involve direct anti-player contact will be conducted by the training director. The TD will be responsible for putting new troops into the pipeline.

*Economic Director* - The ED will be in charge of our resource management. With this many players, and hundreds of people will want their assets moved to wherever we decide to settle in to. The Economic Director will be in charge of all of our hauling, trading, and funding operations.

*Political Director* - The PD must have his/her finger on the pulse of EVE. He will advise the leadership council on the current happenings involving the other corporations and alliances who we may or may not be involved with. He will be our eyes, the political director will be in charge of running our intelligence and counter-intel wings.

---------------

All of these directors will have equal power in deciding the direction of the corp (which system should we start with in nullsec

Of course

The night started as a pretty quiet night in Dreddit.  I was just hanging out in station playing skillplanner online when I see a jabber ping go out for a fleet to save some of our supers.  I'm still pretty new and hearing that there were supers that needed saving, but pretty let down that we didn't actually get any good fights out of it.  

So when I see another ping for a suicide fleet of frigates, interceptors, t1 frigs, and a couple cloakies.  We start roaming through nullsec and head towards Catch and some Angel space which I think is NPC nullsec.  Somewhere along the way a bomber squad suddenly decloaks on us and the FC tries to get everyone to warp away in time but they still get almost half our fleet.  Most of the t1 frigs and a couple others went down and drop fleet, but fortunately since I was in my tanky merlin and didn't have my MWD running, i only went to about 30% shield or so.  Those of us that survived choose to go on.  

We don't get much action for a while and then someone in fleet remembers that we're pretty close to where he used to live or something.  He had a few ships there that he wanted to try to get back to his new home in or around K-6, including a pirate faction frigate Dramiel.  There were 7 of us left at this point, and we figure our main goal at this point is to try to get some of these shiny ships back home and take any fair fights (or unbalanced fights in our favor) we can get along the way. 22 Jumps, ok, we can do this.  Supposedly we're going through some pretty rough space but I'm not sure what that means, its all nullsec to me.  

On the way back, two stilettos, a dramiel and another ship or two.  We crash the gate and manage to distract their fast tackle with some of our own fast tackle long enough to give our ferox and scimitar a chance to jump to a safe that someone created.  This now began a nerve-wracking coordination process where we try and escort the slower jumping ships (the ferox and scimi) through each gate while making sure that the fleet that's behind us doesn't chew them up.  We were a bit ahead of the enemy fleet so we just had to make sure that the ferox and scimi could warp to the perch set by our scout before the enemy fleet showed up on grid. The ferox would warp first, and as soon as he was off the scimi would follow in warp and we would align, and once the scimi entered warp we would all warp as well to make sure no one got left behind as easy pickings.  

This continued for a few jumps until the enemy fleet caught us in one system, the cavalry's arrived!  We can really bring the fight to them now!  People started cheering on comms, but once the enemy fleet saw local spike they warped to the sun or something before they were able to kill any of us.  We didn't have any points on them because we were still in ""run run gtfo"" mode and we didn't want to agress.  But now we are the hunters, and they are the hunted.  We move our fast tackle around to some different celestials while the ferox and scimi warp to a safe with the FC.  Before long, we hear that one of our fast tackle guys had a hurricane pointed.  ""Hurry!"" he says, ""I'm not sure how much longer I can hold him!"".  We all warp to him http://i.imgur.com/hDaAF.jpg (which was around when the screenshot from the title of this post was taken).  Right before I land though, he says that he lost point, but I remember them saying that the fleet of 15 or so blues were a frigate roam.  And when I load grid, which is the last command the FC gave that I can remember.  As I was entering warp

Somehow our fleet's only survivors were the scimi and I.  He said he warped in at 70 which is why he was able to get out, the dramiel, the assault frigs and interceptors, died and were podded too.  So it was just me and the t2 logi left.  The FC apologized for getting us killed and dropped comms, as did everyone else but the Scimi.  I warp to the next gate and get caught in a drag bubble, and there's a stiletto on the gate.  He starts burning towards me and moments later the scimi shows up in the same drag bubble.  At this point I still wasn't sure that he and I were the only ones left, but he starts telling me to shoot it, trying to engage it.  The Scimitar gets to the gate and jumps through, but excited.  I managed to get away from the gate on the other side before any enemies can pin me down and i catch up with the scimitar.  I'm determined to do what I can to scout for the Logi so that he doesn't get caught.  He tells me what to do and I successfully follow his instructions.  On the last gate before highsec (which was the last dangerous section before we entered back into our own space)

I load grid on the last gate before High Sec and as expect, 4, 5 bombers decloaking around me.  CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP.  I need to make a split second decision.  I've been in fleets where the FCs always tell me to make sure the MWDs are off so that you don't take full bomb damage.  But with 5 bombers I wasn't expecting to survive if I was hit, even with MWD off.  And I needed to survive to get that bounce for the Scimi.  I decide to take the gamble and hit the MWD.  My speed quickly jumps to over 2km/s and I see the bombs getting closer and closer to where I originally was.  I'm praying that I'm out of their detonation range.  During this time the gate rats have also locked me and have started shooting me.  I'm seeing lots of damage indicators going off and lots of ships redboxing me but my shield's aren't going down too much.  I see the bomb explosions and I was out of the blast range!  I rejoice and turn off my MWD as soon as I'm at 150km above the gate and tell the scimi to warp to me.  http://i.imgur.com/i4vPR.jpg  We need to get out of here ASAP.  I don't know how bomber fleets work.  I don't know if they have someone that can scan me down and give them a warpin to do another bomb run.  We need to GTFO.  We both warp to the gate and I jump into highsec first to make sure its clear on the other side, and it is.  No war targets.

This was only the third time I have FC'd and without all you guys who got involved it would not have been anywhere near as awesome

Also I know some of us at the beginning got blapped by a 100+ strong goon fleet and left behind so I apologise for that

Thanks also to the guy who sent me 30mil for ""the newbro heroes"", we lost about 15-20 mils worth of isk but we popped just shy of 460mils worth! Op success!

If anyone who was in fleet could post the kills that would be ace, a noctis and possibly something else, if not I will do so tomorrow as I am posting from my phone right now.

Thanks again guys and keep an ear to bacon bar and an eye on deedee in game

Update: Your FC has the taste for blood and is going rabid for more! I am sat in work itching to go get more pubbie tears. If I am on later I am arranging another hisec gank fleet. Be ready for tears in floods Dreddit

Edit 2 I have decided I am going to try and make this a ""thing"", all newbros are encouraged to join in, if your sec status is too low, as mine will be shortly no doubt we will just gank lowsec on a hisec gate that sees activity, we will jump off that bridge when we get to it.

1) The little blender I had to use was godawful. The blades didn't reach the sides of the jar so it was almost entirely useless. In the end I did most of the berry-mashing myself.

2) Though I talk kinda tough in the imgur gallery, though, since I think it really helped the end results. It made icing the cake much easier, since it was like painting on a blank canvas. I will add, however, that it has roughly the same taste and consistency as play-dough so I wouldn't use it again on a cake unless the decoration was more important than the taste, like here.

3) Mixing equal parts white and black frosting gives you black frosting. To get grey you need 2 or 3 parts white to 1 part black. I'm sure the actually crafty painter people already knew this

This was a great deal of fun to do

* Imgur of some of the how: [http://imgur.com/a/B710z](http://imgur.com/a/B710z)
* Game size is about 6MB

**Controls**

* Movement: wasd
* Firing: Left Mouse Click
* Switching weapon randomly: E  (there are only two weapons


I've tested this in Google Chrome

It's a VERY basic top down shooter where you, two will spawn, so the game will get tougher until there's just too much shit on the screen.

**Programs Used**

* Pixlr for image manipulation
* Construct 2 for game creation

Construct 2 is a very neat program because it lets you manipulate things in a graphical environment, so I'm pretty happy anything at all works :D

**Notes**

* I'm not a game programmer
* The laser effect was the most fun for me
* The zooming in and out effect is a little jarring at first
* There is sound

Hiya folks. So, watching all the Alliance Tournaments and generally staring from afar, I finally took the plunge and signed up for EVE. I was hooked. Never before have I ever seen a game so complex. I still don't  even understand half the full intricacies of this game. 

I spent my first few hours missioning around hi-sec after finishing the career missions and the SoE Epic arc before I got bored and decided to try out exploration. I scouted out a nice pocket of 6-7 systems bordered by a few lowsec systems

I moved into lowsec and began ratting in a little shitfit Caracal, but I decided I needed better skills to thrive in low.

Thus, my activity was a little low. Thus, I present to you my Arts and Crafts.

Now,  I asked him why he was having trouble killing rats. I looked him up and asked him for his fit; 2.7m SP, flying a 1200mm rail Maelstrom; 180 dps, 250 tank. Shit, I could kill BS rats easily in my shitfit 600k SP Caracal. So, I decided I would set this terribly abused Maelstrom free and convince the owner to downgrade to a boat he was better skilled to fly.

So

The gang was put together to go shit on the campers in NPC Fountain to make our space safe for little carebears (like me).  Our FC was calm and cool

I heard the go command to jump to gate and tackle something and I was in a fast frig with tackle so that meant me.  I'm pretty sure I got there first but with the lag I was experiencing my Overview might not have been fully up to date.  I locked the Jaguar because I figured slowing down the fastest ship in their group would be best for my gang.  I locked, point, neut and guns over and over to get them all active.  I said on comms that I had a point and then I never said anything again until it was over.

For the first few seconds I was panicking because my mods wouldn't activate on the first click.  There was lag, they were hitting me just fine.  As I realized that I was about to lose my ship I started trying to spam a warp button.  That was when I realized that I was warp scrammed.  So I switched to trying to turn on my MWD instead.  That didn't work the first three clicks because the AB was still on, natch.  Turn off AB, turn on MWD, start trying to get out and everything just freezes up in the lag.  I figured I'm probably dead by now so I go back to warping to try to save my pod.

Five seconds later the lag clears

FUCKING DREDDIT KILLED THEIR ENTIRE GANG IN 10 SECONDS OF ALPHA FURY

All of my orbiting and spamming buttons and taking damage and panic encapsulated all of the rest of the fight as well.  Without all of them being so cool and calm and taking out each target I'd have taken the last shot to cost me that little ship.

So... I'll probably park the Dram for a while (though no guarantees) and start taking a Jag out so I can learn to fly and learn to actually 'see' what is going on instead of just realizing it all after the fact.

The biggest mistake I made was not taking the time to clarify who the FC was so I could say 'thank you' after it was over.  He was awesome,False,self,t5_2rhwu,False,,,t3_gri9v

This is my submission to the Arts and Crafts program. I made a small 2D game

The plot line (since there _must_ be a plot line) is thus: You are a fresh pilot in Dreddit flying a small tackle Rifter in a fleet exploring a strange wormhole. Suddenly, and to top it all off, your fleet is being attacked. Being the faithful and fearless tackler Rifter pilot that you are, you immediately head for your tackle target, targeting system or not. However, it is on the other side of the enemy fleet! 

I had a lot of fun making this smallish project: coding the engine, and have fun playing it!

Edit: I am currently creating a .jar file so you can just execute that. It might take me a few hours though

**What are tacklers?**
Tacklers are ships that slowdown (stasis webifiers) and stop enemy ships from getting away from the field of battle (warp disrupter and warp scrambler). Any ship can tackle

Afterburners and Overdrive injectors make you go faster (though you have to activate the AB to make it work) and Nanofibers make you turn faster. Weapons fire as you expect.

**What skills are needed?**

Racial Frigate III

Propulsion Jamming I

Electronics III

Navigation I

Afterburner I

Hull Upgrades I

Mechanic I

Theses skills take about 2 days to learn. You may need some fitting skills (Electronics

**Merlin fitting (Caldari):**

Lows: Overdrive Injector

Mids: Afterburner, Cap recharger (gives you more capacitor, not essential)

Highs: 2 Rocket Launcher and 2  Hybrid Blasters (short range) or 2 Missile Launchers and 2 Hybrid Railguns (long range).

**Incursus (Gallente):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors

Mids: 1Mn Afterburner I

Highs: 3 Blasters (short range) or 3 Railguns (long range)
also one light drone (Warrior or hobgoblin)

**Rifter (Minmatar):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors

Mids: 1MN Afterburner I

Highs: 3 Autocannons and 1 Rocket Launcher (short range) or 3 Artillery Cannons and 1 Missile Launcher (long range)

**Punisher (Amarr):**

Lows: 2 Overdrive Injectors and 2 Nanofiber Internal Structure

Mids: 1MN Afterburner I

Highs: 4 Pulse Lasers (short range) or 4 Beam Lasers (long range)

Note: use the Crucifer if you want to use a Amarr frigate with 3 mid slots.

**Why no armor/shield tank?** 
Cause if you get hit by a cruiser or battleship (your most likely enemy)

**What enemies/modules  should I fear?**
Short answer, webifiers can slow you down to make you a sitting duck waiting to be destroyed, Neuts can wipe out your cap so you can't use any of your active modules (a sitting duck without any offensive weapons). 

And oh yeah

**Short range or long range weapons?**
Short range weapons do more damage and will be able to hit most drones attacking you, Neuts and Webifiers which will likely kill you. 

You can also have blasters on your ship while orbiting at 12km +, cause if everyone started doing this, we'd kill noone. 

**Warp disrupter or warp scrambler?** 
Warp disrupter has more range so if you want to stay out of range of smartbombs/Neuts/Webs or want a better chance of stopping your enemy getting away use disrupters. If you want to disable a Micro warp drive or having fitting usage issue (needs a quarter less CPU usage) use a scrambler.  

**How do I use a tackle ship?**
If you see a enemy on your overview in range of warp disrupter/scrambler hit F1 (your disrupter/scram should always be in the F1 slot) and then hold down crtl button and spam click on the enemy to get a lock.  

If your enemy is out of range hit approach or orbit and turn on your afterburner/Micro warp drive. Approach gets you there faster but you are more likely to be hit and die.

Once you activated your disrupter/scram on the enemy you have him ""tackled"" he can't get away unless he breaks your lock

**What is a micro warp drive?**
 Micro warp drive (MWD) can replace your afterburner as your speed booster. It requires more skill points and way more capacitor and fitting to use

**Should I use expensive modules?**
You can but everybody will think you're an idiot :D. A Tech 2 warp disrupter/scrambler is the only exception to this rule as it gives you more vital range.  

**I really like tackling alot what should I do next?**
Become a better a tackler by learning more navigation and capacitor skills. Also turn up to lots of fleets to get experience. There are Tech 2 tacklers called Interceptors that you may want to look at for the long term.

**I don't like tackling what can I do?**
 Learn electronic warfare. Especially if you're Caldari or Amarr.

After a while, and decide to orbit a ship out near the edge of the fleet. 

Suddenly, drones everywhere, but he manages to escape. I was in a rifter, and had begun approaching with a MWD when he jumped, so now I was out from the fleet, near where he had warped in.

That's when the main enemy force arrived. I took a hit from a cruise missile, and healed my shields and armor to half. I panicked, and tried to get back to the safety of our fleet, but wasn't fast enough.

I found myself in a pod, I just woke up in 6vdt with a notification about the insurance on my rifter being paid.

The fight was still less than 3 minutes in, and I was finally back in a rifter, and ready for combat again. I undocked, and immediatley fell victim to a station camper with artillery. 

Back in my pod, then after saying ""GET AT ME"" set a direct course toward him. I made it about 50 meters before his guns locked onto me, and I was back in the medical station, 9 jumps from vft. The fleet chat was mostly congratulations about winning, and how awesome logi was, so I decided that I had lost enough ships today, and at 5:47

After hanging around the home base since landing there

Getting there was uneventful

But before that even, toying with me almost. He actually managed to fly into the grid of my first safespot! But I was halfway towards warping away...

He never caught me

I warp into KVN. Local channel goes from empty to crowded with hostiles. Not wasting any time, and then another. Then I warp within 100 km of my next gate, it's time I got out of here.....warp ends and HOLY SHIT the whole hostile fleet is here camping the gate!!!

I flew back to my most complex safespot to gather my wits again. I convince myself that since I'm coming from a random safespot

And so, getting ready to spam the jump button. 

I see myself entering, SUCKAS!

(I know I didn't actually engage anyone
