For Christmas, two of my friends had to drop out at the last minute, leaving only myself and one other. We had not been camping together before, but knew each other fairly well (friends for about 12 months), so we were completely comfortable going as just the two of us. For convenience of writing and anonymity, I'll call her B.

The walk itself went quite well (save for a tiger-snake that I nearly stepped on), B woke me up asking if she could come in to my tent for a second. I was a bit confused, but thought that perhaps she couldn't sleep. When I unzipped the entrance, I could see that B was shaking and seemed incredibly nervous. Thinking that something had happened or that she was suffering from hypothermia, I asked if everything was alright. Unexpectedly, she broke down crying and told me that the trees squeaking in the wind was scaring her, which seemed incredibly out of character considering that the encounter with the tiger snake earlier that day barely phased her. Since I had only just been woken, so I tried my best to comfort her and ask what was wrong. Within less than two minutes she started throwing up. 

Now, I realised she was having a panic attack. I tried my best to comfort her and threw some dead ferns on the smouldering fire-pit (I assumed that panic attacks wouldn't mix well with not being able to see anything). Eventually, she was calm enough to speak explain to me that she had been in a car accident about two years earlier where the driver of the other vehicle was killed and that she was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result. She was still shaking and occasionally vomiting, so I made sure she sat next to the fire and kept her fluids up. 

Luckily for us, I don't doubt that that would have happened with the ammount of vomiting). At 3am, they arrived and drove her home, they were also kind enough to drive me back to my car at the bottom of the mountain.

I should repeat, illness, allergies, snakebite, sprains, broken bones, asthma, however, that's coming from someone that once supported a partner through schizophrenic episodes and frightening hallucinations - In a remote setting

****

So, **discuss these matters with your party**. Before travelling, ask yourself how you would respond to a mental health emergency such as a panic attack or psychotic episode. **If you - like millions of others - struggle with mental health issues that may lead to a similar situation, please discuss them with the people you're camping with if you can**, even subtly if possible. 

**If you find yourself in a situation where someone in your party starts having an anxiety attack, empathetic and patient** (Edit: User BadDadWhy [also suggests you be polite](http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/153jxp/a_little_safety_and_first_aid_suggestion_that_id/c7j1ig4).). Re-lighting the fire so that the campsite was well-lit helped a lot in my situation, but your circumstances may be completely different to mine.

If you're not sure how you would respond to a person suffering from such an attack or episode:

* ['4 Things You Shouldn’t Say To Someone Having A Panic Attack'](http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/4-things-you-shouldnt-say-to-someone-having-a-panic-attack/)
* ['How to Help Someone Who's Having a Panic Attack'](http://www.livestrong.com/article/152711-how-to-help-someone-whos-having-an-anxiety-attack/)
* ['Learn First Aid for Psychosis](http://mindhacks.com/2007/09/12/learn-first-aid-for-psychosis/)

*****

**TL;DR**: Friend of mine experienced a post-traumatic-stress related panic attack during a camping trip, even if none of your party members are known to suffer from mental health issues: They might not feel comfortable talking about such very private and sensitive issues, meaning that you may not prepare for them. If you find yourself dealing with a mental-health related emergency in a remote location, be empathetic, caring and understanding to the victim - Try to stay calm, do NOT yell, and make sure to keep an eye out for physical issues that may result (e.g. shortness of breath, etc). Most importantly

This is the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1fel90/all_loaded_up_on_tulemalu_lake_nunavut/


I did this trip through a YMCA wilderness camp that I'd been going to since I was 11, 20, 30, then 50 days, traversing further north, in the Quetico just north of the BWCA, the Bloodvein and Pigeon Rivers to Lake Winnipeg

As our group took form we emailed back and forth about routes and planning. In total there were 6 women plus a guide. I was 16, and one going into her sophomore year of college the fall after the trip. Our guide was 24 I believe. We all knew each other from past trips.

We decided to pioneer a new route that no one at our camp or any nearby had done. Baker Lake is the most popular terminus, Back, Kazan, Kunwak, and Dubawnt. We decided to begin with the Dubawnt, then hook up to the Kunwak and Kazan via the Slow River, which was relatively unmapped, never thru-travel. [Here is our route on Google Maps.](http://goo.gl/maps/vKyp4) This is a rough map

We all got to base camp in the Boundary Waters after whitewater training on the St. Louis river near Duluth, outfitted our boats and such. Our guide and the camp had organized the plane drops and tickets. TO be clear, our ""session"" was 50 days. The session includes the time we're at camp before the trip, and all the transportation before and after. Day 3 or so we headed out in a big van with two other guides (just drivers) and drove to Points North Landing in Saskatchewan, the end of the road going north. Points North is a mining facility that happens to be on a lake, so they also charter bush plane drops and picks. It took us about 3 days to drive there.

[Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/MY2lR.jpg)

[Picture 3](http://i.imgur.com/IgoUPKy.jpg)

Here is a GEAR LIST oh so exciting:

-[3 canoes](http://i.imgur.com/FYMKMc5.jpg) (Old Town

-7 Duluth packs (one was a SealLine waterproof one we packed all our Thermarests in)

-1 Wanegan (I don't know how to spell that, bulk items like milk, brown sugar, and butter, and the spice kit in, same size as a Duluth pack)

-7 gallons of white gas

-2 bear barrels for food (not huge ones

-800 lbs of food (we ate like queens, personally I love to read about that shit

-2 Cabelas 4-p tents

-1 screen tent

-3 Whisperlites

-2 daypacks

-a bazillion tampons


between the 7 of us:

-8 knives

-12 Nalgenes

-10 paddles

-44 pairs of socks (I had 13 of those I love my socks it's my one trail luxury)

-11 books


I fuckin love lists so here's a list about food

-800 pounds

-8 punds of butter yaaa we ate that all

-3 food loops (each one lasting about 2 weeks so you are only dealing with that much food in a bag. the other loops stayed untouched until we needed them)

-I think we brought 12 onions and 8 heads of garlic. we randomly also had 2 potatoes so we made french fries one night.


Sample meals:

-gado gado (""asian"" peanut noodles)

-nature burger (veggies oat burger things taste like the real deal) with bisquick buns and a zillion bbq sauce packets. A few times we stuffed the burgers with Jarlsberg SO DAMN GOOD

-Oatmeal obvs

-coffee cake (baked for REAL it's my favorite trail meal)

-granola of course

-quinoa

-mac n' cheese with parm and Jarlsberg be jealous

-calzones

-quesadillas

-burritos

-Eggs/hashbrowns/cheese (called eggs po cheese)


Lunch is the same every day:

-cheddar

-salami

-tortillas

-trail mix

-Matt food (peanut butter, honey all mashed up in a mushy goodness)

-chocolate 

-rehydrated hummus

-dried fruit

One day near the end of the trip we realized the cheese was making us all feel sick after lunch so we broke into our Tillamook aged cheddar that was vacuum sealed and still good. That was a beautiful day.

Have I talked enough about food? I don't know.

ROUTE THINGS:

So we were flown into Wholdaia Lake and paddled the Dubawnt River from there. The Dubawnt was characterized by largish lakes and moderate whitewater. (by largish I mean normal for up there but bigger than most Boundary Waters lakes). We were still below treeline so we were in what's called the [taiga](http://i.imgur.com/rNVu3h.jpg)

STORYTIME: Our biggest incident

On one girls birthday, 4 people stood along it, downstream in the water, and pushed the side up and away from them. I stood on a rock upstream and pulled on a painter line (rope attached to the end of the boat). Another 2 people stayed in a canoe downstream in case anyone floated away. It took a while, but rocking it back and forth it finally was set free from the rock. It was in the water like that for about an hour. We decided to camp and assess damage. The boat had metal gunwales and those were no longer curved but bent (like an octagon as opposed to a nice circle). There were also holes where the plastic bent and creased. These were repaired with epoxy. The yolk and one thwart were busted so we lashed those with p-cord back to the boat. In all it was miraculous that it was okay. Past groups have had the same accident and the boat had been completely shredded and the trip was canceled.

[Shit going down](http://i.imgur.com/rt8MI.jpg)

[Repairs](http://i.imgur.com/m7VcRh.jpg)

Continuing on the Dubawnt, we were able to experience the ice and walk around on it and pull canoes across for a little bit, but the wind blew it away in time so we crossed in a timely fashion. It took us just two days, each day we crossed a bay at the bottom of the lake, about 10 miles across each. We had been experiencing pleasant, sunny weather but when we reached Dubawnt lake the temps dropped and we were very very cold while crossing ice.

Then we reached the Slow River. This was a small river we would be traveling upstream for about a week, exactly halfway)

A good 5 gallon paint bucket is a great thing to have in your gear. They are cheap, sunscreen, toilet paper, bug repellant. Set it inside the tent during the day when you are out and about. 
By the picnix table you can use one as an extra seat. Store the food that doesn't need to be kept cold. Hang it where the raccoons can't get into it. 
I have an old one that is beat up. I use it as a trash can. Collect fire wood. Fill it with water to douse the fire pit before you leave. Carry the hatchet, bellows, mallet, shovel. 
I generally have three of them. 
This goes for car camping, I could easily use a couple more. ",,False,self,t5_2qk80,1351043094.0,,

This will totally change how I camp in the future! I wanted to share

Here is the woman's response


Ok

As much as I love tent camping

Also

I invested in one of those sealing machines. The pouches from those machines are made to toss into boiling water. That machine made life so much easier for me

Spare time for packing, was in short supply. With my sealing machine, I developed the habit of always cooking extra of any meal that would work as a ""plan over"" for the freezer. I did this throughout the weeks prior to a trip. I wrote the item and the date on them in permanent marker and stacked them flat in the freezer. 

For breakfasts, raisins, honey, etc. go into the packet and those are sealed and tossed into my freezer. 

For eggs, pat of butter, green onions, ham pieces, or whatever you fancy. These can be cooked up into omelets by just tossing the egg packet into boiling water or you can empty the contents into the frying pan for scrambled eggs. 

The beauty of using the boiling bags was twofold for me. Everyone can have what they want for their meals and all I have to do is pull the packets and toss them into the boiling water pot. Almost no cleanup too. After they are heated or cooked

Since I maintained plenty of pouches in the freezer

Right before a camping trip, so this cut down on the amount of ice we needed too. 

At the camp site, which was mostly thawed by this time, and tossed it into the boiling pot. My son could have spaghetti and meatballs while I had roast chicken and wild rice. Since we always packed a few extra meals, we could invite any new friends my son made to come eat with us. 

There was no wasted food. At the end of a trip, freeing me up to do the camping laundry and relaxing a bit before going back to work. 

You can pack anything that can be reheated from pizza leftovers to your own complicated recipes. Soups and stews are awesome on a cold night in front of a campfire. We took pasta, fruit, and potato salad) by putting those into the sealing pouches to float in the cooler to keep them cool but free from melting ice. Garlic bread can be cooked with your S'more fork over the campfire. 

Seriously

We even made our own mini condiment pouches (ok, and relish containers with us too. We typically washed the bigger packets to cut them up and turn them into other types of packets. 

You can also make individual disposable shampoo packets, cold water, little soft toys, and glitter bits to put on a toddler's lap when shopping on a hot day (keeps them occupied, can't break, and you can refill and reseal and keep them changed up and interesting) You can make frozen fruit squeeze treats too. Once you start using one of these things, you end up finding more and more uses for them. 

Sorry for the mega post, play catch, cast a few more times for that fish before going back to the camp for dinner.

1342736819.0,wub3e,BIOLITE REVIEW from my own personal experience last weekend.,ICEFARMER,56,6,48,"Okay


**Setup and First impressions:**

Very very well well made. The only cheap thing about it is the crappy little 6"" USB cable they give you with it.  At 2 lbs. 4 oz **(correction 2 lbs 1 oz)** so it's not heavy and is very portable.  They include 4 firesticks as starting aids and a nylon carrying case. (and 4 starter sticks). 

Super easy setup was simple and it works quite well. Power station goes in the side and then flip down three legs.  Easy enough.


**Starting the fire:**

The battery has a bit of residual charge so as soon as you press the power button it starts the fan on Low (it has a low and high setting) which reduces your need to blow on the embers directly. Loading your fuel in is pretty simple it can only go in from the top.  This is where the fire starting can be tricky because there is no side port to add flame at the bottom.  You must load fuel and fire directly from the top.  (They send the biolite with some firestarting sticks but I didn't use them).  If you start fires poorly you will produce a shitload of smoke as the fan pumps air into the chamber.  A recommendation I would make for those who are not confident in their fire starting would be to make a teepee out of small twigs (less than 1/8"" diameter) and put in your hand.  Put your ignition in the bottom and light it (or if you wanna chance it drop it in)



**Fuel:**

Any dry biomass seemed to work well.  

Starting off I used some very fine tinder and slightly smaller twigs etc. and used some thicker as the flame began.  Size wise for stickes I would say 1/8"" thick or smaller were fantastic to get things starting off.  1/2"" were excellent once the fire got going. It could do some larger but had trouble once they reached about 1"" thick unless I had a really good burn going.  In terms of length

Leaves and dry grass were no problem.  Chewed through them like nothing.  Also tried cardboard and paper that worked really well.  None of these burned for long.

Pine cones, pine cones.  These were my favorite fuel of the night and they usually burn like shit unless you have a big really hot fire going..  (I have access to 3 huge pines so they were everywhere).  Dry or even damp worked great once the fire was going.

It burned relatively little fuel. If we subdivided a log it may have lasted for overnight.  That being said you do have to continuously feed it like any fire throughout the night by tossing in a touch more every few minutes and I can see some people getting annoyed by this.  I didn't mind at all.

**BURNS INCREDIBLY CLEAN. I WAS VERY VERY IMPRESSED.** Unless you let the flame die and then you get smoke.  Don't let the fire die or do if you are attempting to clear the entire forest of mosquitoes.

Another note is that it burns best when completely level.  Slight angles affect the airflow and it doesn't burn as efficiently.  This was easy to fix.



**Ash Production:**

Very minimal.  As aforementioned, uncontrolled fires starting) and quickly insert the new material, minus the ash, back into the Biolite.  Total time to do this was about 20-30 seconds.  If you know your way around a flame it's about as quick as changing a bottle of fuel on another stove.


**Cooking:**

I boiled 2 cups of water in a small aluminum camping pot in about 3:55.  The base is extremely sturdy.  I added a little more fuel as we used it to ensure the flame's consistency and turned the fan to the high setting.  Pretty much what they promise.  My wife also made some smores and roasted marshmallows and other foods on sticks over it (which drove me slightly nuts with the anticipation of dripping marshmallow but it didn't happen).  This is a very capable cook stove.


**Notes On Heat Production:**

The design is excellent in that there is very little lateral heat though the materials.  Though not recommended I was able to bare handed move the lit Biolite by grasping both the power station (recommended) and the lower outside mesh of the combustion chamber.  The heat produced out the top was excellent


**Charging ability:**

This is kinda the big one everyone seems to care about.  It produced power.  If you hood up a unit like a USB powered LED bar, it will not continuously power.  It seems to have a battery setup where only excess power is send to the charge unit, which makes sense.  Keep the fire going and use the extra when it comes available.  The way it worked while charging my phone was simple.  After the fire got going for a while, there is a green indicator light that will illuminate on the power station.  When this light is lit, there is extra power available and you can charge via USB.  When you have used the extra charge in full, like when I was using my iPhone 4S, it would charge for about 10-20 minutes (depending on if we had the Biolite on low or high and depending on the flame we had going in it of course) then stop charging for 1-3 minutes before beginning to charge again.  How much does it charge? How fast?  I was able to have my phone, increase 20% in 47-50 minutes fairly consistently.


**Take Down:**

After finishing up and emptying the combustion chamber


**Overall Impressions:**

Very happy with my purchase.  Works very well.  Is very functional.  It pretty much what they promise it to be.  A slight learning curve for ppl not comfortable making fire.  Requires finding or making small combustibles which some people may find annoying.  Needs a few twigs every few minutes so it's not as turn on an forget as a Jetboil or a large fire but used very little amounts of fuel; produces excellent

Any Questions?

**EDIT: correct weight  is 2lbs. 1 oz. or 935 g.**

**EDIT: I have had people comment on the charging capability. My phone was in use and on while I was using the charger. I had several calls come in and took some photos and a couple of minutes of video with it as well. Would reddit like me to do a test with a drained phone turned off and some charge times that are more strictly monitored? If so I don't know if I'll be able to do it this weekend (going to UFC - yay) but I can try. Let me know.**",self,t5_2qk80,1342885582.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/wub3e/biolite_review_from_my_own_personal_experience/

Things that may seem obvious to you can still be helpful to others!

Here's a few of mine (forgive me if these have been repeated ad nauseum:

* For trips that last 3+ days, instead of opening the big one every time you need a fresh one. Ice will last you a week or more.

* [A portable bucket](http://www.amazon.com/Seattle-Sports-Camp-Bucket-Blue/dp/B001F1YI24/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372480910&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=portable+bucket) is worth its weight in gold. Which ain't much because it weighs next to nothing. It rolls up very small and will quickly become one of the most useful things you can bring. Use it by the lake to wash the sand off of your feet, haul water for boiling, and on and on.

* Shave off pieces of a bar of soap into a baggie for washing. Many folks use wet wipes

* Damp clothes can be dried in your sleeping bag overnight. Your body heat warms it

* Buy a [Thermacell](http://www.amazon.com/ThermaCELL-Cordless-Portable-Repellent-Appliance/dp/B0031ESIVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372481904&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thermocell). They can be found in most camping sections or hardware stores and the like. It's the only thing I've used that actually work to keep the bugs away.

* Someone else in this sub recently advised someone else to never pass up a chance to buy old tent poles if you run across them at garage sales or the like. Whoever you are,,False,self,t5_2qk80,False,,True

STORY TIME:

They launched the canoe at 3pm-ish and by around 4 were over in another lake via a short portage and had just finished up setting up camp. Now, you're basically in a remote area.

As they're finishing up the set up

So, he paddled over in his canoe to a cliff across from the island he was camping at to grab some photos of the sunrise. Shortly after arriving, he was accosted by a black bear. Now, he was on a cliff, so the bear was blocking his exit. The bear charged, he emptied his bear spray into it, and without any effect the bear charged again. The guy ended up tripping, realized his breathing wasn't working correctly. Decided to portage up a 50 degree slope over to the other lake

My friend is a paramedic in training

They gave him a ride out over to the next lake and helped him over the portage. He ended up paddling down to some cottages to get help getting to shore [there's a marina at a bay in the lake]. Official prognosis - two broken ribs and bruised lungs. He's lucky to be alive.

My friend ended up heading down to gather the solo campers stuff up - found the cliff he fell off

Anyway - craziest thing I've ever heard. Guy is so

* Charcoal 
* First Aid
* Garbage Bags
* Ice

I live in Kennesaw so if you know of nearby places with fair rates on renting things that could be useful as well.

My boyfriend and I are going cross country in about a week. I've never really traveled much in my life, etc.)

I have a list of places we're definitely going and places we would like to go if we can fit it, we don't have a strict plan- for example, I can't say ""Ok, so we'll be in San Diego on August 1st, in LA August 2nd"", etc. We're basically seeing what we have time for a how long we want to stay in each place.

I've been looking on the national park websites and seeing what campgrounds they offer. Some are first come first serve, and many of these campgrounds don't have electrical hook-ups. From what I can tell, there are many private campgrounds that would have electric, but I don't know how to find them, and I have a feeling I'll need reservations. My boyfriends dad has a KOA card, but in order to look at prices you need to pick a specific campground and put in the dates you'll be staying.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Should we return the air mattress since we likely won't have any way to inflate it? We would like to spend the least amount of money possible

We're going for 6 or 7 weeks. Here is our plan: We live on long island, to Austin TX. Then New Mexico to Colorado to Utah, then the grand canyon and Vegas. After that we're going to San Diego and making our way up the coast to Washington, then over to Glacier National Park in Montana, down to Yellowstone. After that we're going to the badlands in South Dakota, then Chicago and home.

Will snag ""special"" foam padding from work this week and use that on my shoulders ;)   I'm sure hip bruising was from jeans,and all the pleats, riviet, and crap.  I'm also not where near fit enough for this weight, so....that will have to be fixed later.
I gave all upvotes....and took all advice!

I know this because you *must* reserve your site via a website, and you *must* reserve it for at least 2 nights.

My fiance and I have been talking about going camping for a while now

I have a little bit of camping experience from when I was younger (only on large commercial lot style campgrounds unfortunately...don't think it's really camping if there is a lodge facility with showers, so we pretty much need to start from scratch.

I've been looking around on Amazon for gear options since I figured going off of customer reviews would be better than going into a store knowing nothing about what I need and getting upsold without realizing it.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for someone just starting out

1. Does anyone have a list of the actual gear that we'd need?  I have a basic idea of what we'd need to bring with us but I'm afraid of forgetting something that we'd need.
2. Can I trust the big stores like REI or Dicks to actually tell me what I'll need?  Or am I better off researching and buying online?

I figure we'll most likely start off at Great Smokey Mountains National Park since it's only a few hours away and seems like a nice place to get a feel for things. ",self,t5_2qk80,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/pm6kx/getting_started/

* June 19-20-21: Badlands/Black Hills/Mt. Rushmore area: riding + hiking
* June 22: ride solo to Cody / Yellowstone NP
* June 23-27: Yellowstone/Grand Teton area
* June 28-30: road back to Chicago/Los Angeles 

Now

* 1) We are not American and we never camped in the US
* 2) Does anyone have a good camping suggestion for any of these places
* 3) When I am in the Badlands, the Black Hills? Or is it better just to pick one location (Rapid City?) and then tour from there? 
* 4) Yellowstone: we have 5 full days: is it enough/too much? I know the park is huge
* 5) Yellowstone: should we stay in Cody? I am leaning towards staying there

I'm looking for a campsite in Ontario

a) secluded (not like a trailer park style

b) accessable by car



I'm having a really difficult time finding what I'm looking for, and set up camp at a remote secluded site). Unfortunately, one of these buddies took a nasty spill recently, gave himself a concussion, and won't be able to exactly rough it. So I'm looking for something that won't be too strenuous for him, and somewhere we'll have the car close if we have to pick up and go. 

Any help would be appreciated.

How large of a cooler do i need for my family and the length of our outtings? I'm guessing between 50 and 120 quarts...

How should ice be placed in the cooler?  Should it be layered in the bottom of the cooler with food placed on top or should the ice be dumped on top of the food?   

Do any coolers have dividers or organization within the cooler?  I always hate having all my food floating in the bottom of the cooler.  I also hate having everything just kind of thrown into the cooler.

Is there any benefit to using ice packs instead of ice?  Do they last longer or stay colder?  I know plenty of people use frozen water bottles to keep their food cold in the cooler.

I've been camping a few times

I live in Nashville TN, tell me.

The tent I've recently bought is huge. I bought it because of the great reviews, but I plan on it lasting a few years (hopefully) and I plan on going with other people too, so others can use it if they need to. But due to it's size and weight it pretty much rules out much hiking. I do want to be by a lake. At least on the first trip this summer, and probably a lot after that. 

The type of sites I'll be looking for are by water

What I would like from you pros, but would probably find useful had I brought it. I've already got things like the tent, lighting, and bug spray covered. I'm also going to get a gas stove, what I need to make a fire, and probably a survival shovel also. (or do you think that's overkill?) Any things you can think of that you've found useful that I might not think of? Any techniques, principles

I'm looking to do some ultralight cycling hammock camping this summer. I realize each of those are different subreddits but decided to post here as my questions are more general.  

I'm in Southern BC Canada. These trips will most likely be in Northern Washington. Vancouver Island and The Okanagen Valley. I don't plan to bring much in cookware if anything. I'll most likely stop

I'm going to be cycling ~200km's a day and can't guarantee getting to an actual campsite at any time. I figured as long as I have a tent/hammock I could throw it up just off the side of the highway for the night. 

As someone who hasn't done a ton of camping in actual wilderness before the idea of being so exposed to wild animals scares the eff out of me. I know only a couple basic things like:  
 - Don't keep anything scented in the tent at all. ANYTHING scented (toothpaste/deodorant/soap/food etc) and to tie it off a little ways away from where I sleep.  
 - Sleep with a stick and if something comes sniffing just wack the side of the tent.

I'd feel way more comfortable knowing a lot more. What resources can I check out websites/books/blogs for this kind of just of the road camping style?

We are lucky in that we don't have to stick to a set schedule and spend more or less time wherever as we please, again stopping wherever looks good and isn't crazy crowded. Does this sound feasible? Do we *need* to plan and reserve in order to camp? Will there be nasty surprises where we won't be allowed to camp somewhere and will get stuck having to pay for a lodge? Can we really just pull off to any exit that has a KOA/campground sign and pitch our tent for the night? We are just going to be in a little Mazda with a tent, sleeping bags, and basics- are there RV only places? I feel like these are really basic questions that I could find the answer to, but I would really feel more comfortable in having tips from real people who actually have done this! 

Thanks!!

1338915796.0,umbmx,Backwoods camping - Need advice,,12,1,33,"Hey guys

I looked at some of the [MSR](http://cascadedesigns.com/msr/tents/experience-series/nook/product) tents and their average pack size of around 17""-20""X5""-10"" is not even close to what Nemo has to offer. The prices are not much of a difference either.

Ideally I would like to find something between $100-200 and under 5lbs with a packed size on the single digits (i.e. 6""X8"").

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

UPDATE: A lot of good suggestions. Going with a [hiker's mosquito net](http://www.amazon.com/Coghlans-9775-Hikers-Mosquito-Net/dp/B000HGMNOS) and a [tarp](http://www.kelty.com/p-518-noahs-tarp.aspx) seems to be the most economical

I am still on the search for a tent!

Thanks all for your suggestions.
