I pledged this last semester to a large fraternity at a large university down south. I was the oldest pledge at 21, 3 active) I've done more than I have in my entire college career put together. 

*I've made God knows how many friends this semester. And not just friends that say they're my friend because we're brothers, and just all around treat me like they've known me their whole life. 

*I've slept with three girls...IN ONE FUCKING SEMESTER! That's a 200% increase over my first three years of college put together. Fraternity life in general,000% more outgoing when it comes to girls. I can't explain what it is, but I somehow gained confidence I've never had before and girls (and guys) noticed. 

*I've gone places and done things that I never imagined I would. Gone on trips and adventures with my pledge brothers I thought only happened in 1980's style fraternity movies. I made so many memories in just one short semester

And all of this happened because I decide to take a chance and do something outside of my comfort zone. No it wasn't easy

I believe that it is necessary to maintain the highest quality of brotherhood. I was hazed and I do not hold anything against the brothers who were dishing it out. It made my pledge class close and we all came out stronger. Nothing can create the bond that we share better then a little pain and fear. Although there is a clear line with some fraternities taking hazing as a rite of passage and turning it into who can beat the pledges the worst. I like to think of it as constructive learning

Update: A quote from a past chapter president that speaks volumes, if you are not then we are not doing our job as a brotherhood. I want each of you to feel like quitting at least once while pledging. Then if/when you get initiated you will realize how little amount of work pledging was compared to how much you gain from being a part of this fraternity.""",,False,,t5_2s0mx,1343179563.0,,

I am working on a startup called www.greekdrop.com, and potential internship and job offers. Think of it as a specialized Groupon for us, except its going to feature products we want, and help us find jobs. 

We are still in development as we do not have the store up yet, .edu e-mail, and house on the homepage, it would help bring us better brands. You will gain access to the Beta launch  which is essentially just the first week of discounts, and a lot other quirks.* Also liking us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram will definitely keep you updated as we get more brands

Twitter and Instagram: @greekdrop
www.facebook.com/greekdrop

So far in our first week

1. www.solebicycles.com
2. www.solewood.com
3. www.hydracup.com
4. www.12society.com is in once we have 5
5. www.getsomejerky.com

And we are definitely planning on talking to many

How are other ways you can use greekdrop? 
1. Get discounts on hotel rooms
2. Find internship and job opportunities specialized for the greek life community
3. Redeem FREE product samples
4. Discounts on clothes


Let me know if you have any questions, or suggestions. I would love, and need suggestions on what brands to contact. If you have something you want to buy, suggest it to us, and we'll try to get that company to give us a discount! We are thinking of implementing a campus ambassador program If you want to get involved, send me a pm, and we can talk. 

Thank you for reading this long post in advance.

One thing I think we need to work on is how to deal with mixers we have with ""higher"" sororities. Obviously, when we do manage to set up mixers with better sororities, the girls they send are often freshmen with no say in the matter - girls who have to go, and have poor preconceptions of what the night is going to be like.  
  
We have the usual - beer pong, bar area, dance floor - but it's hard to get girls involved at first. They're a little aloof and disinterested, and at first they'll kind of clump together. This makes it tough for *us* to be interested. However, brothers *do* have to stay tenacious and keep working at them, because all sororities are going to be like this for awhile. Once girls open up a little they have a good time, but occasionally we'll have mixers that are a complete bust because we can't really get things going. Contrary to the message of this post, but for some people (especially freshmen)

I'm not concerned about hooking up - it happens often enough - I'm just way way more preoccupied with making sure the sorority as a whole has a good time

We've managed to stay afloat for twenty years without any attachment to the school and have recently become recognized on campus about two years ago.

We are the only house in the city due to a grandfather clause but we are struggling to grow. About 4-5 pledges are admitted every semester. Part of the reason for the low numbers is that the actives number between 10-15 and moral is low. The other cause of our slow growth is the reputation the fraternity has accumulated on campus.

The scandal mentioned above was over an alleged rape that occurred about 20 years ago. In the end no one got arrested and all charges were dropped. Story from the alumni goes that one of the girls that routinely partied with us got mad over something and cried rape. I dont know the real story but thats besides the point. 20 years later the house is unkept and struggling to pay the mortgage and utility. On campus the freshman and non greek students are told that going to our house WILL get you raped and that our members are drug addicts. We make efforts to break this stereotype but many people have it set in there minds of the character of our members. Our parties have been said to be the best by our patrons seeing how ours is the only actual house. 

I'm writing this to hear yalls feedback on the situation. Maybe some of yall have been in a similar circumstance and can offer assistance. For instance a good way to flip the perception is to highlight the perils of gossip as an incentive to be open minded towards our fraternity. Feel free to add your two cents so we can evaluate each others claims.     ",,t5_2s0mx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/1kksjr/how_to_flip_a_bad_reputation_into_a_good_one/

(My fraternity) is bashing my face into a brick wall
It is climbing uphill, clawing my way to Light, but hopelessly trapped in a dark and unknowing pit of ignorance. I’m clawing at the walls to draw passion from the passionless, but the ears of the unknowing are clogged with their vices. The “brotherhood” around me is usually my biggest adversary in every project.  It represents everything I despise: apathy, arrogance, entitlement, and pointlessness.  I have less faith in my brothers to come to my aid than I do a random stranger in the street.  

Every single day, I have to withstand my brothers talking behind my back, ostracizing me and mocking me because I have passion.  I care about what I’m doing, and I act intentionally.  (my fraternity) is hypocrisy and cowardice and the institutional imperative—mindless mirrors of men reflecting shadows of a flawed system.  It is degradation, humiliation, and a bullet point on my resume which makes me less attractive to employers.  (My fraternity) is daddy’s money and a C average stirred together in an effort to never grow up.

What is it we try to achieve as a group? What is our purpose? To strengthen one another and fight for what we believe is good? To be a collective force for what is right? To support one another like brothers would support brothers? I see none of this.  As individuals, I believe our fraternity would stand for…nothing because action is a prerequisite of standing.  We don’t stand for shit because we don’t have passion.

My fraternity, our inactive chapters more than quadruple the still active ones, and finding another active brother in the US is a game of Where's Waldo. It makes me sad because we used to be great in years past but in a couple of years we're going to end up having to merge.

Anyway, is virtually unknown to people at my college. Parties are hard to come by, and we're very insular. On top of that, we've recently been suspended for 2 years for hospital visits during pledging, though we're appealing it. By the time we're back, most of our fraternity will be gone, leaving one or two pledge classes in addition to mine.

I want people to know our chapter again on campus. We need to continue recruiting, well-connected individuals to our fraternity. I also want to start doing parties for the fraternity, but I need a place of my own first. I've been thinking of trying to rent out a brother's first floor of the house for the night or something, but I'm not sure if it would work. Also, befriending other fraternities may be an option for parties.

I've got moderate social anxiety, and I'm not even sure I'd get a bid anywhere if I did rush. Greek life is huge at my school, and it sort of just comes across as this elite group of people that I'm not good enough for. 

Now other than being shy, I love to party, I've got decent grades, and I'm into southern style/""frattire"" which is huge at my school. 

Basically my question to you guys is, or should I just rush for the hell of it, be myself, and hope that I get a bid? I feel like joining a fraternity would be a great way for me to force myself to be social, it's just that I can't help but think I won't get into one.

I am a brother in ΦMA Sinfonia, with somewhere around 6,500 actives and 246 chapters.  On campus (in our small college in Iowa), we're the oldest (72 years in June) existing social on campus and also the largest.

This is all well and good.  The problem lies in that the other Greek organizations on campus don't *recognize* us as Greek, as recently as 2010, they were concerned about further upsetting the balance between men's and women's organizations on the council (currently at 2-1).  We don't necessarily want to be on the Greek council either, because Sinfonia and the other socials on campus (ΔΣΦ, Acacia, and ΑΟΠ) have somewhat different goals in life and some of my brothers feel that membership on the Greek council would restrict us too much.  

All that said, it causes some bitterness when, for example, the Sigs go around billing themselves as the oldest Greek organization on campus when we have them beat by 15 years, or Acacia tells its recruits that it's the largest on campus when we consistently out recruit them.

tl;dr:  How does one go about gaining recognition as Greek with an uncooperative Greek council?

A few of us had some similar ideas all based around greeklife so we decided we could make something out of them. Facebook really doesn't cut it. It's way to public and too difficult to manage people in groups that you aren't part of (e.g. you can't make use of a sorority Facebook group).

Problems we saw:

* Its difficult to get the word out to the people you want and only them
* Frats are terrible at keeping their brothers on track with the social schedule
* Finding dates to formals or date-parties is really annoying unless you plan on taking your friend in another sorority
* Getting set up by friends is awkward
* There is no forum for two houses (one frat and one sorority) to discuss their activity
* Organizing a Formal out of town is very time consuming and expensive including busses

We aim to solve these problems.

[Here](http://vimeo.com/44292496) is a link to our pitch deck (I'm not in the video).

What I need from y'all:

* What is difficult for you as a brother?
* What is difficult for the social chair?
* How could a service improve the quality of greek life?
* Would you use such a service?
* Have you heard of innergreek? Do you use it?

1. Don't wear cargos
2. Don't wear AE/Abercrombie/Aeropostale
3. Don't be creepy
4. If you don't handle alcohol well or you turn into a douche/creep/whatever when you're drunk
5. Rush around. Don't just rush one fraternity and because they we're super nice you feel like you can't go to another.
6. Take fraternities/sororities talking about other fraternities/sororities with a grain of salt. Sometimes it's true
7. Don't tryhard. Just because you we're on TFM for most of your senior year high school classes doesn't mean you need to start wearing Ralph Lauren/VV/Brooks Brothers/Southern Tide/Croakies/Chubbies. Props if this is what you grew up wearing though.
8. Don't be creepy.
9. Don't talk about all the shit you did in highschool
10. While partying is a rather large part of greek life in most areas
11. Don't just show up to the rush parties. Go to other events too. It shows again that you just aren't looking for a fraternity to party.
12. Don't try to be someone you're not. Just because you aren't ""fratty"" and you want to join the upper middle tier ""fratty"" fraternity doesn't mean you should change how you are(unless you're a solid guy but you need to break out of your shell/be more of a gentlemen/shit that can benefit you in life)
13. This one is iffy
14. Don't brag/seem to be a overconfident douchebag(unless you can back it up in intramural sports). Dad owns a company worth $50 mil and you have 4 houses? Keep it to your self unless you show up in a 911 and the brothers ask about it. Wealthy people that are classy and don't flaunt their wealth obnoxiously are much better company and brothers.
15. Try to dress better if you don't already. 
16. Don't act like you're in the fraternity already no matter how much the brothers seem to like you/lead on you getting a bid. Unless they directly tell you something like that
17. Have a dope drinking skill? Show it. I got my nickname from a rush party for beating all the brothers in chugging. Just makes you stand out a little.
18. Try to make relationships(sexual or just friends
19. Going off of 18

I go to a large state school in MO *wink wink*

1. Grades. I'm a smart guy trying to get into law school

2. I'm super liberal and I think most fraternity guys are super not liberal..

3. Douches. I KNOW. Geeds and what not are just slandering your good name. But the fact is a lot of douches ARE attracted to the benefits of a fraternity. It's like the difference between a single crazy racist and the KKK. (not saying fraternities are equal to the KKK haha) Obviously one if going to get more attention.

4. I'm gay. I realized I couldn't really be out and be in a ""good"" fraternity so I didn't want to try to rush something that would hate who I was. And I figured I could find more guys outside of it.

Cue reality. I'm a masculine gay guy, or banging guys who have girlfriends of 3 years. I thought the whole concept of being in a fraternity was about brotherhood? Doesn't it cheapen it all to not let in a out gay guy but let in 10 closet cases who are too afraid to tell their brothers?

Do any of you guys have experiences with closet cases? What is your opinion on it all? And why do you think such a homophobic community on the surface attracts so many closeted gay guys?",,t5_2s0mx,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/xg9f3/how_do_you_feel_about_all_the_closeted_guys_in/

1332399327.0,r82it,Alright bros. Lemme get your opinion,Carson_Perry,3,4,12,"So this girl I went to high school with also attends my university. When she found out we were both greek as freshman

Well around this time last year, because the day these girls had their big little reveal night, she texted me asking if it was alright if she found a different big brother for her little. Normally I would not open my bag of fucks and hand one to her, but I already bought, for what I thought would be my little sister, a few containers of certain beverages, a sweatshirt with her letters, a VIP pass to a local club for her and her friends

Needless to say I wasn't exactly happy. And I made that very clear to this sorostitute. I gave the gifts to her new big bro to pass along anyways because they would be no good for me to hang on to. 

Now it gets to the point where even I can't be tftc. This girl that originally wanted me to take her little has put me in the dog house with her sisters and caused the biggest seen on fratville on St. Pattys day because I took a little brother this semester and chose a girl from a sorority we were paired up with for greek week to be his big sister. She screamed that we had an agreement she would be the big sister and when I told her that was off when she switched me out for her little

So now the university is getting involved because of her illegal claim and I'm the reason girls in her house and a few others hate my house. 

So my questions are:

Am I totally in the wrong for not making her my little's big?

What can I do to stop the bad blood?

Thanks for reading. I hate drama
