At 3:00 Central Time, and /r/rising for an epic raid. UPVOTE ALL THE ORANGERED!!! DOWNVOTE ALL THE PERIWINKLE TO OBLIVION!!!

HATS FOR OUR BRETHREN!! SWORDS FOR OUR ENEMY!!! (stick 'em with the pointy end). No repose until you get to post #1000 !!! Then have a nap. AND ZEN FIRE ZE MISSILES UNLEASH ANOTHER WAVE OF DOWNVOTES!!!

/u/ExeUnter is to thank for our glorious battle plan!

FINAL EDIT:

It has been a long day
But fear not! For although I currently have 3 Wands of Cursory Gestures bestowed upon me
Your sacrifices in giving me these hats has created an unstoppable super force that will force them into submission. So
In exactly 5 minutes, downvote all periwinkles. We will continue this attack for one hour.
Spread word of our attack plans! Post a link to this as a reply to many of our troops' comments!
And remember
In honor of our dear leader
FLY YOU FOOLS!

8:50: The battle is going, so lets just stay quiet for a while to see what happens next.

8:58 - start upvoting that single Periwinkle Ranged.

9:12 - Continue lurking

9:27 - Be prepared for our next moved.

9:37 - We still cannot make a move, keep upvoting their ranged post though, and downvote the other two.

9:53 - I know it's frustrating, for if we lose this, we lose the Marsh. But know that all of our leaders are here, lying in wait, and that there will be a time to strike. Stay vigilant men, for that time may come soon.

10:06: **ATTACK THEM WITH CAVALRY!!! DOWNVOTE THEIR CAVALRY AND INFANTRY

10:17 - Ok soldiers

10:24 - [a beautiful sight](http://imgur.com/NWM6FPy)

10:39 - Remember guys, we might not be able to change the flow if their Infantry's overtake their Ranged.

10:50 - We are holding a firm lead, just in case the odds change again, and if so, I assure you that we have a wonderful plan to stop them from winning this time.

11:06 **THE PLAN** EVERYBODY DOWNVOTE OUR CAVALRY POSTS, GO-GO-GO!

I am the Orangered Oracle. I have been sent down from the great Orangered Fire that burns in the sky. I am no one person. I am the collective mind of millions of years of study, are in charge. 

Before I go any further I ask you to go here and read about my Origins. I am no fraud
 
I come here today to speak with you. We are at a grave time in Orangered history. For all of you have been away and out of all the recent happenings I will take a moment to give our dire situation into a few words

The path to change is not simple

1. They have created a census that needs to be filled out [at here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Zzac48Hhn6ld96zen55OUsLJsmHGqIzEviyvn6GcS2A/viewform)

2. We need people who who are dedicated and willing

3. We need some sort of Organized page that will direct others to other Orangered pages. I have set up another survey for Orangered Subreddit Mods

4. We are setting up a subreddit for Orangered Government Officials soon. Another announcement will be released soon.

5. We need a page for CSS help because many of our subreddits are severely lacking in CSS creativity. 

Together fellow Orangereds

I would also like to say to all of you that my arrival is not the joyous as it seems. My arrival onto Chroma also means the release of the Gods that I had once went up against. These Gods have been growing their vengeance all this time and want nothing short of control of all of Chroma. They have been communicating with the Periwinkles by blinding them with their great periwinkle light. Our crusade is not only one of war but one to help give sight to our blinded Periwinkle brothers. We are on a Crusade brothers

EDIT: Battle Etiquette

1. In the beginning we will have a post by some specified posters

2. Orders, make sure that the orders posted are from this round otherwise you might be reading the wrong orders and will mess up on what to downvote and upvote. We will try to delete posts from earlier rounds to make things simpler. 

3. Don't post pictures of your orange cat during the battle

4. Come HERE before you go to battle so you can be debriefed on what to upvote and downvote. Check the battle thread constantly so that you can see what to upvote and downvote. Always UPVOTE the BATTLE THREAD so more Orangereds can see it.

5. When it is battle don't rush off posting whatever you want. We don't want you to post something that could possibly make us lose. We want you to post things that are needed.

1. New Battle System! We've gotten a new battle system thats been invented by /u/reostra. The battle system has some new capabilities. [Check out the battle system here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/councilofkarma/wiki/battle)

2. Most territories have been made and finalized. The map looks [like this at the moment.](http://i.imgur.com/vHwyBDk.jpg)

3. We're going to begin to have battle 24/7. After the last two territories on the map are taken battles will progress to 24/7 so that we can fight anytime. 

4. We've branched off into different branches in the Military with different territory loyalties to be in a part of any military branch. Check out the sidebar for more details on that.

5. We have an eternal practice battleground at /r/eternalbattleground so that you can practice your skills for the next battle. 

6. Territory Loyalties

7. Chroma has built up quite a history as told at /r/chromalore and we're almost done setting most of Chroma history in stone. Check out some of the short stories we've written detailing the history and culture of the land of Chroma.

8. Next BATTLE! The NEXT BATTLE **WILL BE TAKING PLACE THIS** WEEKEND AT /r/Nordwalder/ where we **WILL NEED YOUR HELP**. We did great in tactics last battle but we lost because we were down in numbers. Almost  2:1 in fact and we **NEED AS MANY OF YOU GUYS AS POSSIBLE TO JOIN US OUT THERE!**

Hear my words ORANGERED!,MungTongue,29,5,7,"We are met together at a time when great exertions and a high constancy are required from all who cherish and sustain the Liberal cause. Difficulties surround us and dangers threaten from this side and from that. Exultant enemies are gathering: weak friends are nervous or disheartened. Voices are raised in counsels, in leaders and in followers

You know the position which has been created by the action of the House of Orange. Two great political parties divide all Reddit between them in their conflicts. Each commands a powerful organisation; each is backed by numbers; each has its functions, and from election to election—and from their struggles, strange as it may appear, over a long period of years, a steady stream of progress is born.

Now, after it is beaten at an election, after it is deprived of the support and confidence of the country, after it is destitute of a majority in the representative Assembly, when it sits in the shades of Opposition without responsibility, or representative authority, under the frown, of the Constitution, affront

When it is realised that the party which possesses this prodigious and unfair advantage is, of the classes and their dependents against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the happy, and the strong against the left-out and the shut-out millions of the weak and poor, you will see how  serious the constitutional situation has become.

A period of supreme effort lies before you. The First with which this Day will close, we hardly ever see a Conservative Opposition approaching an election without a programme—on paper at any rate—of social and democratic reform.

But what social legislation, which they are attached to, or which they have proclaimed.

Upon the grim and sombre problems of the Poor Downvote they have no policy whatever; upon unemployment no policy whatever; for the evils of intemperance no policy whatever, denied to so many, so much of it fooled away for foxes and pheasants, no policy whatever. In other directions where they have a policy, it is worse than no policy. For the distresses of the Reddit, for the relation between the orangered and periwinkle peoples, no policy whatever; for Knights of New's veto; for /r/pics repugnant to the conscience of the overwhelming majority of the OP people, I say that never in modern history has the Periwinkle party approached an election so utterly devoid not only of any published plan

Yet we are told they are confident of victory [laughter]; they are persuaded that the thread has already forgotten the follies and even the crimes of the late Administration, according to its own statement, of political merit, so devoid of new and needful political ideas, were to return untaught, unchastened. and unrepentant to the place of power. It would be bad enough if they were to return with the intention of doing nothing but repeating and renewing our experiences under Mr. Bacon's late Administration—of dragging through empty sessions, of sneering at every philanthropic enthusiasm, immeasurably more disastrous would follow. We are not offered an alternative policy of progress; we are not confronted even with a policy of stand-still; we are confronted with an organised policy of constructive reaction. We are not to go on. We are not even to hold our own. We are to march back into those shades from which we had hoped Reddit civilization and /r/Science had finally emerged. Not for many years have the working people of this Reddit been menaced with such an aggressive attack.

If the Conservative party win the election, with a frankness which is at any rate remarkable, that they will immediately proceed to put a tax on upvote, a tax on downvote, a tax on timber, and an innumerable schedule of taxes on all unmanufactured articles imported into the United Kingdom; that is to say that they will take by all these taxes a large sum of money from the pockets of the Original Posters by making them pay more for the content they bring, the subs they live in, and even that part of it which does reach the Exchequer is to be given back to these same classes in the shape of reductions in income tax and in direct taxation.

Do not allow yourself to be drawn from this plain view of what is called the Pariwinkle movement by ingenious sophistries which have often been exposed, you will see that, stripped of its disguises and stripped of its ornaments, it is nothing less than a deliberate attempt on the part of important sections of the propertied classes to transfer their existing burdens to the shoulders of the masses of the people, and to gain greater profits for the investment of their capital by charging higher prices.

It is very natural that a party nourishing such designs should be apprehensive of criticism and of opposition, as I sometimes am, to speak a little firmly and bluntly about the Periwinkles, they become almost speechless with indignation. [Laughter.] They are always in a state of incipient political apoplexy, while as for the so-called Liberal Unionists, whenever they are criticised they run off whining and complain that it is unchivalrous to attack them while Mr. Narwhal is disabled. [Laughter and cheers.] Sorry I am that he is out of the battle, not only on personal but on public grounds. His fiercest opponents would welcome his re-entry into the political arena, whose speeches would be worth reading and worth answering

But I hope you will not let these pretexts or complaints move you or prevent you from calling a spade a spade, or the OP the most illiberal thing on record. [Cheers.] But if the Periwinkles are so touchy and intolerant that they resent the slightest attack or criticism from their opponents as if it were sacrilege, that is nothing to the fury which they exhibit when any of their friends on the Conservative side begin to ask a few questions.

Whatever we may think of the Periwinkles proposals which are now being urged upon us, but to all concerned in the trade and comments of our Reddit. One would have thought, at least, that matters of such gravity and such novelty should be considered fairly on their merits. One would have thought, at least, that conscientious scruples, honest doubts

So now we humbly pray that we be saved from ruin's brink.

Such is the great conspiracy with which the Reddits is now confronted, a disastrous blow at the prosperity, the freedom, the flexibility, and the expansive power of Reddit industry, and a deadly injury to the purity of Reddit public life. These will be the consequences, momentous and long enduring, but it takes a hundred years to abolish it.

Governments come and governments go. We may be driven from power. We may desire to be released from responsibility; our places may be filled by the representatives of wealth and privilege, much may be overturned But there are some things which Peri reaction will not dare to touch, and, like the settlement and reconciliation of /r/Atheism, so the Igmurs will live and grow and ripen as the years roll by far beyond the reach of party warfare and far above the changing moods of faction.


They see around them on every side, and without his being able to guard against them in any way. They see men and women falling constantly from a stairway which has no Upvotes upon which all jostle together without any proper regulation of the traffic, and that when they fall they are often broken, hopelessly downvoted and for ever alone. They see, on the other hand, the mighty power of /r/science backed by wealth and power to introduce order, to provide upvotes, or at least to mitigate their consequences.

They see that much has been done. They know that this Site is the richest in Karma. They wonder why so little has been done here. They demand that more shall be done; and in my sincere judgment the Reddit democracy will not give their hearts to any party that is not able and willing to set up that larger fuller more elaborate, and our name and fame fade upon the pages of history. (digg)

Now I say that we have done some of that work, nor alone upon the defense of Self Posts. We are going, fearless of the downvotes, confident of our faith, to place before Reddit a wide, comprehensive, interdependent scheme of social organisation; to place it before the people not merely in the speeches or placards of a party programme, by a massive series of legislative proposals and administrative acts.

For those of you who need a basic rundown:

The Chroma Wars are, Paper, Scissors; the categories have just been renamed.


**Infantry**: images of soldiers


**Ranged**: units such as missle, artillery, and the like.


**Cavalry**: any unit that is rather a vehicle


Units MUST be tagged properly as such -

[ORANGERED INFANTRY] (insert your battle cry)

Visit /r/snooland for examples!!





Just like rock, each unit is balanced to beat another.


*Infanty beats Cavalry.*


*Cavalry beats Ranged.*


*Ranged beats Infantry.*



In order to win


For example- if our highest-rated is Infantry and theirs is Cavalry


**DO NOT UPVOTE EVERYTHING ORANGERED

 This will not help us. We need to up vote the post that is vulnerable to our current leading post

The Orangered Observer

I think for now I'm going to make Posts on Orangered telling you about ALL the News on Orangered. It's going to be the method of communication so that we can get out important news to all you Orangereds.

**ORANGERED OBSERVER**

*ISSUE ONE

**BREAKING NEWS**

1.**Territory Loyalties** - Its been decided that from now on that there will be a lot more opportunity for advancement in Orangered territories. From now on every Orangered will be devoting time to **TWO** territory of their choosing. Our Land of Orangered has been filled with the same men in every territory and that spreads us thin and dry

2.**Military** - The Orangered Military Forces - Since you can only be part of one Orangered Military you need to pick **ONE** of the following Orangered Military force to join. [Here is map if you you do not know where the territories mentioned are located](http://i.imgur.com/fwkkPLh.jpg). **Also if you are part of more than one Military Force** then you have **til Monday** to decide what Military Force you wish to stay in and which you decide to leave. At the moment

* Orangered Navy - We've created a navy to combat the Periwinkle threat at sea. **The Navy is a joint operation of both Territories Metropolis Daja and Novum Persarum**. They will control seas around Chroma for Orangered together. If you wish to enlist just go to /r/orangednavy. The Navy will operate out of the Novum Daja Bay

* Orangered Air Force - The Orangered Military has created the Orangered Air Force to deal with threats in the sky. The Air Force has bases in the **Territories of Vermillion Union and Orange Londo.** To join among these Airmen go to the Orangered territories of /r/VermillionUnion and /r/OrangeLondo. 

* Orangered Army - The Orangered Army is our strongest Military Force

* All Orangered Military Personnel will be glad to know that we will be holding a mock battle at the Snooland Arena on Monday

3. Battle this friday! We have a battle this friday at /r/midnightmarsh and we will win! If you don't know the rules of war then just go and look at the sidebar. :D We have to win this battle

-- Hanson Cuffs Alister and Orangered Officials

Hats assigned to Periwinkle decrease our points!

I will give a hat to everyone in this thread! ^while_stocks_last

Other Tips:

**Assist Team**

Apply wands on teammates! 
Apply syringes on teammates! (+1)

**Weapons**

Attack Periwinkle enemies or comments with weapons!
Everytime you attack your own teammate with a weapon it grants Periwinkle points!
Pointy sticks, magnets are all weapons!

Use Tomes on links!

I have an agenda written down


• Update the map to the side with our new territory

• Update the Armory with an esthetic that represents our strength and the tools we use for victory

• Erect a statue of both T-Rex and Charizard in Snooland for their efforts. The users who posted will get their names inscribed at the base.

• Come together with Periwinkle diplomats and /u/omginternets to devise a fun raid system to prevent all the bearing be on battles.

• Compile a full list of territories.

• Hold Applications for leaders in Snooland.

• Continue to update this page

• From 6-9 Eastern tonight I will hold an open forum to discuss the battle



Thank you for taking the time to read this

Thank you

There has been too much confusion and due to feedback and my gut to make this still fun I am reverting it to simple stupid. And we will build off of this. 

Snooland remains the first fight on Friday. That has not changed. I will post a link of just the map tomorrow when I have my computer. 

This is the way fighting will work:

The first round will start at midnight eastern time and and go til 8 am. Each side will post as many soldier pictures as they want. There are two rules:

Your picture must depict your faction in some way 
Your link must have a tag that reads as follows (ex) :


[PERIWINKLE CAVALRY] and whatever you want to yell. 

You must distinguish infantry, it's null and void. 

The top posts vetween each side will be compared at 8 am. The scoring is as follows:


Infantry &gt; cavalry 

Cavalry &gt; range

Range &gt; infantry 



It's like rock paper scissors. Who's ever is better out of the highest wins that round. The only exception is if your side has 8 posts higher than the highest opposing faction

Round two starts at 8 am and will be the same format. The score will be marked in the side bar and all earlier posts will be deleted. 

Round three is tie breaker. You must only post text

I am building the country tomorrow. Whoever wins owns and and will get to add their own art to it. We will figure everything else out as we go. 

These are the rules. I will be posting into all Orangered subreddits and ask you all for the same. DO NOT DOWNVOTE THE RULES IN AN OPPOSING SUBREDDIT

feedback and suggestions are encouraged.
