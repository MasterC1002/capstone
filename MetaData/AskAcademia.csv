I looked at a number of schools, big state schools, small private schools, the whole spectrum.  I'd be happy to answer any questions people might have about the process, or the lessons I've learned on how to prepare better.

Some quick lessons I've learned that should be of broad interest:

* Schools don't care about teaching.  I had little teaching experience, there are many people you'll interview with that will question your ability to get tenure if you enjoy teaching too much.

**EDIT:** To clarify, of course, a negative.  What I mean by ""schools don't care about teaching"", is that schools will hire a good researcher who might be able to teach over a phenominal teacher who is unproven when it comes to research.

* Universities want to hire business savvy individuals.  I won the most points when I discussed why my research is important

I'll try to answer whatever questions I can.  Fire away!",,t5_2sakj,1338629356.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ugwjl/iama_im_a_recently_graduated_phd_student_who_just/
1367366176.0,1dg3xn,How are things done in your field?,dr_chill_md,74,6,29,"Talking to people in other fields, that don't apply to my field at all.  It makes me wonder what the rest of the academic world is like.

I study computer vision

**What's your field?**

Computer Science.  But I can't answer the rest of these questions at that scope

**What are the roles of conferences vs journals?**

Most new work is published at conferences (and this *is* considered ""publication""; I believe some fields do not consider a conference paper a ""publication"").  Many journal papers are revised

**What's the paper submission / review process?**

For journal or conference, but since many journal articles are extensions of earlier, well-known conference papers, it's often obvious to reviewers who the authors are.  Submission deadlines for the big conferences are 7-8 months before the conference.

**What are the most prestigious publication venues?**

Conferences:

- IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
- International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
- European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)
- Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (This is really a machine learning venue
- ACM Special Interest Group on Graphics (SIGGRAPH) (Really graphics, but I don't even remember the name of the conference.)

Journals:

- International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)
- Transcations on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI)

**How much has a typical

At least 3 first-author conference papers (but possibly up to ten, this may not actually be published at graduation, but should be in the works).

**Are most new professors hired directly after graduation

Mostly after a post-doc, you wouldn't have had to do a post-doc"" attitude that can work to the fresh PhD's advantage.

**Where does the money come from?**

(This probably varies a lot from country to country.  I'm in the US.)  It's mostly from the military and intelligence agencies (very interested in computer vision) and the NSF (National Science Foundation, Yahoo, Nvidia, Canon, Sony).

 
**== EDIT: SOME QUESTIONS I FORGOT ==**
 

**What happens at conferences?**
In some fields (e.g. history, you're expected to prepare a talk, with slides (computer vision and graphics in particular are often much easier to explain with images and diagrams), of about 20 minutes.  But that's only if you are accepted for an ""oral presentation.""  At the large conferences, most papers are accepted as ""posters.""  *This is still considered a ""publication.""*  In this case, you prepare a poster and stand in front of it for an hour or two explaining your work to wandering conference attendees.

**In multi-author papers

The main contributor is first.  In most projects, and see if anyone has the guts to challenge you!).  With more than two authors, it's not as well-defined.  Generally the people who did the most work are at the beginning, and the people who did the most supervision are at the end.  For example if a student in group A does a paper assisted by a student in group B, the order will probably be Student A, Student B, Advisor B, many professors stop putting out first-author papers at all (and to *get* tenure,,

I just wanted to pass along a little advice to those graduate students and post-docs out their looking for a job.  I will state that I am at a mid-size state school

First, mention the classes from the ad.  Our ad said the person had to teach two courses and 1/2 of the candidates did not mention one of the two classes (the more important one in our mind).  Also, unless the job ad specifies that they need special topic classes covered, do not start off with a long list of every special interest seminar class that you have ever wanted to do.  First mention the bread and butter core curriculum courses, then typical electives, then tack on that it would also be nice and give one or two specialty seminar classes.  Also, do not go the other way around and say I can teach any undergraduate class you ask.  This may not apply to all fields, intro

If they ask you how interested you are in the job, we are not going to take a chance on the person that said ""medium-high"".

When asked about your research

When they ask you about resources, if you low ball it, you may be stuck with inadequate resources.  Give them a realistic feeling about your research needs.  If they cannot provide what you actually need, it would be a bad fit for you anyway.

At very least look at the department website before you talk to them.  Making little comments like

1346168437.0,yyrts,Need advice on how to proceed with a terrible lab situation.  Probably quitting Ph.D.,disgruntledThrowaway,54,7,31,"Throwaway account. 

I am currently about a year into a lab and already thinking about quitting.  I joined this lab due to its quickly growing publication record, was more than happy to take the lion's share of the credit and state that he came up with the ideas although he does not understand how the data was gathered, analyzed, nor can he perform, train, or judge quality for any student in the techniques used by the previous postdoc.

I began to have problems in the lab when I found I could not replicate any of my former post doc's data.  Going back into the computer, and inconsistent selection of artifacts that would make our negative control groups look worse, but exclusion of artifacts in our treatment group that would correspondingly make them look better.

He also used a predictive tool on a machine that no one has used in literature

Unfortunately my PI has no experience whatsoever with any of these techniques and simply believes me to be incompetent.  He even called the former postdoc over and they had a long discussion stating how my immaturity and inability to produce significant data with low variance was not very promising.  When I took my PI to see the raw data so that he could analyze it himself

The whole point is moot however as I called in a specialist from a biotech company and a doctor from a nearby hospital with tremendous expertise in this technique and they found that not only was the postdoc calculating the data incorrectly, either did not understand the ramifications of this or did not care, only telling the lab to perform further analysis the new way.

To exacerbate things, he can offer absolutely no advice as he has no expertise in any of our techniques and simply tells us to run the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result while growing increasingly unhinged.  For example, a Western Blot done by two separate students was shown with equally perfect control GAPDH bands in each lane, but the protein of interest was not upregulated and downregulated in the fashion he expected.  The PI basically berated them, telling them to run it again with (no change in procedure) until it showed what he wanted.

I am currently only a year invested into this lab so leaving or switching labs would not be a huge loss.  I just don't really know how to go about this without a good reason.  I don't really want to report the lab to the ethics committee because I believe it would give me a bad reputation in my university (although I have backups of all the data produced by our lab).  My main issue is that I feel this lab is a dead-end.  It will run out of funding soon, receiving no training, and being berated on top of that.

**Student E-mail**:

Prof. Galloway

I would like to discuss a matter with you that bothered me. Yesterday evening I entered your 6pm Brand Strategy class approximately 1 hour late. As I entered the room, they explained that you have a policy stating that students who arrive more than 15 minutes late will not be admitted to class.

As of yesterday evening, I was unaware of your class policy. I was disappointed that you dismissed me from class considering (1) there is no way I could have been aware of your policy and (2) considering that it was the first day of evening classes and I arrived 1 hour late (not a few minutes), it was more probable that my tardiness was due to my desire to sample different classes rather than sheer complacency.

I have already registered for another class but I just wanted to be open and provide my opinion on the matter.

Regards
xxxx

**Professor Response**:

xxxx:

Thanks for the feedback. I

Just so I’ve got this straight…you started in one class, went to another class (walked in 20 minutes late), left that class (again, presumably, in the middle of the lecture), and then came to my class. At that point (walking in an hour late) I asked you to come to the next class which “bothered” you.

Correct?

You state that, you opt for the more conservative path or hedge your bet (e.g., do not show up an hour late until you know the professor has an explicit policy for tolerating disrespectful behavior, check with the TA before class, etc.). I hope the lottery winner that is your recently crowned Monday evening Professor is teaching Judgement and Decision Making or Critical Thinking.

In addition, urinating on desks or taking that revolutionary hair removal system for a spin. However, xxxx, there is a baseline level of decorum (i.e., manners) that we expect of grown men and women who the admissions department have deemed tomorrow’s business leaders.

xxxx

xxxx

Getting a good job, navigating the politics of an organization, finding a live/work balance…these are all really hard, xxxx. In contrast, respecting institutions, having manners, demonstrating a level of humility…these are all (relatively) easy. Get the easy stuff right xxxx. In and of themselves they will not make you successful. However, by virtue of you being admitted to Stern

I finished a Master's degree in Anthropology in 2000.  I barreled through it and achieved it in 1.5 years with a 3.9 GPA.  I immediately went on to start on my PhD.  Needless to say I hit some bumps along the way.

My 2 years of course work went well and I managed to maintain my 3.9 GPA.  I ended up being a GRA and then GTA for 3 years.  During my qualifying exams I ended up going through a divorce from a 10 year marriage which left me as a single mom of 2 children.  I made it through my qualifying exams with flying colors

I ended up meeting my now current husband about 2 years after the divorce and subsequent qualifying exams.  My GTA ran out and I had to get a real job, all 276 pages of it.  Turned it in, started some revisions and turned it back in and faced more revisions.  In the meantime I ended up taking a different job back in Michigan and moved back across the state and put my PhD on hold again.

For those who don't know, at least in science (my field). But tenure is the golden fleece, offering the tantalizing reward of ultimate job security and thus also intellectual freedom -- some of us can pay a lot of dues to even the get the positions that will allow us the opportunity to pay even more dues to get tenure. To get a tenure track job, we take the shorter term, non-secure, positions to build our CVs and to survive financially. For her, in the humanities, for me, so its hard to put down roots. Obviously

It seems no one knew how hard she was taking it. The web is now full of posthumous testimonials and obituaries about how she was surely the brightest rising star in her field

I am reasonably sure even my closest friends, have no idea how close I too have come also to losing hope. How you can feel that you are doing what you love, and that you are talented, but that even people who appear to be perfect struggle to find what we call a ""real job,"" the only measure of success. And we all know, deep inside, that we are imperfect somehow, is too much for anyone.

Students, but be aware of how hard they are working and how much they are sacrificing. They do this because they love the subject you are there to learn, because they love teaching, and they love the idea that one of you might fall in love with it as well.

Tenured faculty, don't be so taken up in the mad dash to try to secure your tenure (another depressing issue, though, I know) not to offer support to the contract profs who absorb a lot your teaching load or postdocs who work slavishly to get you the data and papers you need for you grants and to get tenure.  And fellow contract profs/postdocs, try to see the other ones as sisters and brothers in arms, make more of an effort to share your insecurities and worries, so no one feels so alone and fatally imperfect.

And friends, let her know that work isn't everything, and you can't know who will win the game of life until the very end.

**EDIT: I am not going to get into a debate here about women being under represented in science at the level of tenure track positions, it was not something I believed either just from casual experience.  But by being exposed to the data, numerous studies and some investigative journalism pieces in *Science* I have changed my tune.  But I will speak to my personal experience, in my field.  I was the first female student who successfully finished under my adviser, who was 63 at the time and had maybe 40 students finish at that that point.  As a postdoc I have worked in, or closely collaborated with, 6 different labs, 4 of which were women.**

1328483721.0,pcemo,So give me a better alternative.,mike918,39,10,19,"I'm feeling insolent.

There is a tendency among some academics on this forum to advise against pursuing graduate studies. They cite the usual reasons--decreasing salaries, the joy of crushing dreams; 2) egoism, ""I successfully navigated the world of academia but I would not expect as much from you""; 3) sincere concern for the well-being of the student, which I suspect is the primary reason, but I could not help including the other two.

Certainly the concerns are substantial. Attrition rates alone indicate that many students either are not adequately prepared for graduate school or are attending graduate school for the wrong reasons. That being said

Which brings me to the title of my post. You don't owe your students an alternative. Providing the answer to the question ""How should I live my life?"" is not, each of you is complicit in a system designed to develop skills applicable only within that system. It is also an unsustainable, increasingly corporatized system that charges students an exorbitant tuition so that they might pursue positions within that same system for wages too low to cover the cost of the initial expense in the first place. Moreover, your jobs are dependent upon, among other factors, the student's or her financial providers' willingness to pay for the classes you teach. We can, of course, on the whole, underemployed (to borrow a phrase) students on the job market who increasingly consider graduate school preferable to positions hopelessly unable to recognize the value of books beyond entertainment

So I ask, but on the same sense of sincere concern that motivates you to discourage graduate studies in the first place, what is a better alternative? Where can I use these skills that mean so much to me that I dedicated four years to honing them, that help me define who I am, if not within the very system that encouraged me to develop them in the first place?

Full disclosure: I recently completed my Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature and am in the process of pursuing graduate studies. My question deals with the humanities more than the sciences since the sciences tend to develop skills applicable outside academia. Finally, I am merely concerned by how quickly professors discourage graduate studies without stopping to asses the ambivalence of their position or, if they do asses that ambivalence, then it has not been done publicly, *to my knowledge*.",,False,t5_2sakj,True

1320004092.0,luc08,About turnitin and why it should be eradicated.,michael_faraday,32,5,12,"General introduction to turnitin:

* [Turnitin's website.](https://turnitin.com/static/index.php)

* [Wiki page on turnitin.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnitin)

* [The wiki talk page on turnitin (has interesting discussions about the service).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Turnitin)

First of all, in the fear of loss of academic merit, all the times that I didn't stand up and opt-out or confront the faculty. For those who don't know why I'm upset, turnitin essentially violates student copyright and your privacy by making profit from your papers (and essentially everyone else's papers since they're all stored in their database most likely without your permission) without any compensation all while claiming its ""fair use"". The fact that it's all proprietary and a commercial enterprise posing as a well-meaning education tool is more than enough for me to completely disregard it. 

On the service itself, I see it only really see it catching obviously blatant plagiarism which any competent professor should be able to find on their own. 

It's also the service's percentage system, and be able to resubmit it indefinitely until they felt satisfied with their turnitin score for the final submission, essentially allowing anyone to get near-zero plagiarism results. This didn't help anyone because students who plagiarised their essays simply keep just editing and resubmitting their essay to get better results rendering turnitin completely useless—of course this was completely the faculty's fault since they clearly had no idea of how to implement it properly (or they did, since it made their students artificially perform better and at a higher standard).

I've seen luddite professors convinced that it was a catch-all, and by extension, the professors, essentially send the message to the students that ""we don't trust you and don't care about your rights"". 

It speaks volume about the service when [Princeton, declines to use the product,](http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/04/04/15061/) although you still have many other top universities still erroneously using it in some courses. I really just hope I can convince/encourage some academics here to not allow their university to implement turnitin, or if they already do, to try advocate the removal of the service.

Anyways, weight of animals, date of dosage, etc.).  However, on his excel data and in the later pages of his notebook, numerous animals in his treatment group were thrown into the non-treated/control group because I assume the treatment failed.  Furthermore from reading his previous publication, he claimed that he used n=20 per group.  In the folder that contains all the excel data for his paper

This was extremely annoying because many of us in the lab have projects that are extensions of his paper and if his treatment never worked

A week later, report me to my department head, etc.  I ended up apologizing while secretly being furious.  The postdoc's notebooks were taken and have completely disappeared from the lab though a general rule of thumb is everyone, including past lab members, must leave their lab notebooks to help in data replication.

Words cannot describe how incompetent and stupid my PI is.  I am actually surprised he ever made it this far. During the year he has degraded me by making me write his kids' essays for college and grade my fellow PhDs' written qualifying exams (which he is supposed to grade himself).  I have given scores to abstracts for large conferences and even reviewed manuscripts that are meant only for my PI's eyes.  My comments need to be broken down into incredibly simple language so that he can understand them (non-native English speaker) and he becomes infuriated when my sometimes page-long reviews are too complicated for him to understand.  I have saved e-mail exchanges of him requesting all of the above.

Anyways, he called me into his office and told me that he thought I won this grant due to luck and his mentorship.  He then proceeded to tell me that I had too much free time on my hands and was not a hard worker...on the day that I won a huge national grant.  I responded that I was teaching this quarter (I did awesome and had stellar reviews because I dedicated a lot of time to it).  He snapped back that he was patient with me this quarter, but he expected more work out of me in the coming months.  I was understandably pissed.

All that is coming around though. I planned my escape route after being yelled at a year ago by applying for numerous jobs and other programs.  I basically have large standing offers from numerous avenues in and out of science.  I don't want to list them here

My question is how do I quit in a way without making too many waves?  I consider the bridge with my PI burnt as he is not a reasonable person at all and will take any attempt to leave (especially with a huge grant) as a grave insult.  He has also not ever graduated a single PhD student so it will hurt his standing. I do not want him going batshit insane and slandering me with lies so he doesn't look bad losing a student(though actually I am fairly ready for this to happen).  I do have backups of all data and email exchanges so I guess I could totally nuke his reputation if I heard he was trying to destroy mine.

I am planning on telling him that I am disillusioned with science and was given a high paying offer to work and that it is nothing personal: I just want to work and make money.  I am planning on doing this soon and giving only a few days notice because I know he will flipout and kick me out immediately.  However, and telling him the truth of why I am leaving (crazy insane PI).  ",,False,,t5_2sakj,False,,

I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.
My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life.
Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright
I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.
The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science.
I would love to join either a scientific journal/publishing house or manage an international graduate school. This is where I need your help Redittors
I have posted some incredibly personal stuff here so I created a new login just for this. I have been a Redditor since my depression started and I always love the support I have gotten from /r/ depression and will always be thankful for that :)

I'm asking mainly because I have gotten offers from two of my top-choice schools. One is my undergraduate university, fellowships, etc. Additionally, this university has unmatched resources in the USA and is regarded as one of the best programs, if not the best, in the world. I get along well with the faculty, and my research interests line up extremely well with my potential advisor (who is currently my undergrad advisor). She is an up-and-coming scholar in the field on tenure-track, but she does good work. (Other things of note: Two profs in the department are also retiring soon and are guaranteed to be replaced by newer

As for the other university, but as far as I'm aware, they typically cannot guarantee funding for all five years, especially for out-of-state students; I would have to renew it year after year and establish residency in the state for tuition purposes. My potential advisor there is a middle-aged, extremely well-published, world-respected and world-class expert in the field (read: hotshot). Our research interests do not line up as well, but they do intersect at down the line, not having met him yet

All in all, mental, social). On the other, there's this better-respected advisor and the fear of ""academic inbreeding"" and how that may affect my chances of employment years down the line. The profs in my department whom I've spoken to have all told me they don't think inbreeding is a big problem, especially in light of the school's reputation and the fact they are hiring two new profs. But, well, of course they'd reassure me of that considering how much money they threw at me, they won't see

1374863471.0,1j425p,Supervising undergraduates: is he underperforming or are my standards too high?,,33,7,38,"I've been here before asking for some advice with working with my summer (undergrad) student.  As of today

He is working full-time and I have him on three projects (all connected) to keep him busy during the day.  One project is experiment-based, so to fill the rest of the time I gave him a sort of literature review project and one where he edits some already-produced data of the type he is producing on the bench.

My experience with him as been as follows:

(1) There is almost nothing I can simply ask him to do, he couldn't write an outline for a paper or do a literature search for a recent paper without me showing him exactly how to do, and essentially doing it for him.  For his literature research all he ever did was read the books I gave him and summarize the information, when I told him explicitly they were just to get him started.

(2) If he doesn't do something immediately after I teach/show/discuss it with him (even after repeated instruction), then he will do it on his own and do very well.  However, when I repeat the same process with the same task, but I let him take a few days in complete the task on his own rather than immediately after we have done the teaching session, it is clear he has forgotten a lot of how to do things.  It isn't just the science either, it's even simple steps in data entry.  I've asked him to take notes when we talk and I give him my own directions, but I don't think he looks at them.

(3) He doesn't seem to want to troubleshoot/figure things out on his own (this may be related to (1) above).  I admit that when I give him things to do, there is someone on the internet somewhere who has had the same question.

We have a meetings every day for half an hour so I feel he has plenty of time to ask me questions and we can go over things

EDIT: Since this thread is still alive, and he is almost completed it.  Midway we had a talk where I said it was good time to switch from ""school"" mode (I give him assignments, grade them, and then return them) to ""project"" mode, where he takes time to think about what needs to get done, how to do it, and how much time he thinks it will take (all with my counsel).

He also did not hold a class on the day before Thanksgiving (not blaming him on that, but adding to the picture).  As more and more classes were missed, the class became more rushed.  The syllabus was changed, an exam was dropped, leaving the essay paper and the remaining tests to be worth more points.  More classes were missed and in class lectures turned to the professor printing out the class notes and handing them out in class with a little bit of discussion.

So I'm a 3rd year Master's student at a public university. I've completed my coursework and am now in the pre-thesis research and writing phase. I successfully proposed my thesis topic in the spring yet have done absolutely nothing more on it over the summer as I was teaching two courses (one of which had 90 students and usually a professor teaches it with a TA) as well as working as an RA on a summer youth program project that took up all the hours in my day that I wasn't teaching. 

The professor I wanted to originally work with left two weeks before I arrived two years ago and I was forced to take a year to explore my other interests and options (which turned out to be better as I found research that I really enjoy) and because my cohort came in during a ""transition"" period for the curriculum

My professor is batshit crazy and has alienated herself from every person I know. She didn't get along with the other professors and just recently left the department because her research isn't in line with many of the other professors (in fact she is the only one in the department who does the research that she does and that I've gravitated towards). This has caused a rift among students as well as among professors with students. Now the Dean is after her and would love to see her gone and she has all this legal bullcrap going on and is WAY too busy (and selfish, which isn't all that great and now it's time for me to get the hell out of here.

The only way out as I see it is just doing my thesis research and getting the hell out. The only problem is that since the program was ""in flux"" and they never gave my professor any courses since they hated her

I've kept holding out and saying that things would get better but I feel like I should have quit when the professor I wanted to work with left (though I would have never found my passion in research). Like I said

I'm currently doing a PhD in computer science at a university I'll keep anonymous. I will have been in this program for 3 years at the end of the coming summer. I'm at a point where I'm considering quitting

I have good funding and I like computer science. I like the work that I do, but I decided to change university because of some advice I had received, which was that you shouldn't do your undergrad, masters and PhD at the same university. I very much regret having done the switch.

My PhD advisor is lazy. You have to bug him alot to get forms signed. He's also too disorganized to use an agenda. I was used to having weekly meetings with my advisors in the past. He can't be bothered to give me a meeting time. I have to ask him for a meeting, and that I should come back in 30 minutes. The current situation is that I haven't had a one-on-one meeting with him in at least two months.

I also feel rather demotivated by his attitude about my research. He's lazy

I feel like my advisor stalled my research work uselessly, prove I can do better than the competition. Except I barely have any motivation left. I feel I have other ideas worth publishing about, but my advisor's attitude is always the same crap. He doesn't want to take any risks. He basically wants you to prove that something will work ahead of time, only then is it worth studying.

I'm not quite sure what to do. I'm about halfway through my PhD, closed to new ideas. The exact opposite of what I feel researchers should be about. I generally feel unappreciated. I also feel that the treatment I get is perhaps unfair. Other students seem allowed to do whatever they want without so much tension. It may have something to do with my female/trans status, but this isn't something I can measure objectively.

Advice or moral support would be appreciated. I will say that I applied for a PhD at McGill (where I did my MSc) last semester and got accepted.

Fast forward to the present. I'm in a healthy relationship now, and overall content with the way things are. Suddenly, said professor comes to my office out of the blue (he's at a different university). It kind of ripped me up inside, as I thought I'd dealt with this, but apparently I'd just been pretending not to care. I was excited and happy to see him, but on the other hand, it felt horrible.

So much of this relationship has shaped who I am now - my career path, how I view my current advisor (unfortunately I have a rather large crush on him, and I suspect I'm just projecting my past feelings rather than really liking him - but at this point I know better than to show this or act on it). This negative experience in my life in some ways makes me feel like he ""made"" me. I also feel sort of longing towards my ex, even though it was a bad situation, he's married with children, and I'm in a great relationship now.

So

* Once you have finished your PhD you can apply to become a lecturer. You would need to have at least published a couple of peer-reviewed articles and more often than not you would need three or four years prior teaching experience in a position called Associate Lecturer (Associate Lecturers are usually teaching whilst doing their PhD or have just completed the PhD)
* Next is Senior Lecturer
* Then Reader
* Then Professor. So, are at the top of their field and are usually in their 50s. If you make Professor by 40 then that is pretty exceptional. 

Is this the same in the US? Is there a different hierarchy? My impression, is there a way to distinguish between early career Professors and more respected, established Professors?

I have always wanted to do science, not sleeping, drinking too much, unable to visit my family for a year. I have back problems from clenching my jaw all day and the general tension. I don't want to meet new people because when the inevitable ""what do you do?"" or ""how long have you been in the country?"" questions come up all I have is negative things to say. I used to be such a relaxed and happy person and I don't know how I ended up here. I thought the point of taking science with its crappy pay, crappy career prospects and crappy working conditions was to avoid ending up in this state in my thirties. 

I thought science would be a more relaxed career, you are even more of a slave than in a corporation (everyone is a slave for the glory of the PI). Politics and petty infighting is much worse than anything I experienced during my time working in a company before coming back to study. Everything is about grants and papers, an interesting idea that might take a bit of time to flesh out gets ignored because it is more important to work on something that gets published this year. I can look forward to the next 5-10 years of putting all my savings towards international moves every 2-3 years (I already spent all my existing savings moving to my current lab), no pension (I am early thirties), no possibility to settle down anywhere. Meanwhile all my friends from school and university are having great lives, having children, lovely weddings, and how I gave up my twenties studying for this and I think what I am doing?

I don't have any teaching responsibilities, so I don't know where I am supposed to go from here.  I know a lot of this is coming from the poisonous atmosphere in my current lab, and I am looking at other postdocs (in fact I have a definite opportunity to continue in science if I want to with a position in a different country) but I look at the salary and the prospects for the rest of my life and old age and I really can't see how its a good decision to make. At the same time I don't want to feel like a quitter or a failure or one that couldn't make it. But I just don't get excited anymore about writing papers, I find it a bit meaningless working so hard to churn out articles that realistically no one, or at least very few people are going to read. I don't agree with the broken system of closed access academic publishing.

It's common in our field to have a recommendation letter from the lab director.

Now I've dealt with this and moved forward, and is obsessed where I get interviews.

Furthermore, since we are in the same lab, I feel like she is always watching who I network with, and she will try to outdo me by talking to those people as well. This extends to our annual conference where she constantly ""joins in"" my conversations with faculty in other departments. She has asked me what I wear, bring, etc. during interviews

Anyways, and said something like ""oh don't worry, you'll find a job"" in front of our students and my advisor, and I got really frustrated.

1335319608.0,sr1q1,Being verbally accused of cheating. I don't know how to defend myself.,thegrieved,17,2,13,"Throwaway account...Just in case.

As a background, I have never cheated on an assignment, ever.

Our department is fairly small, and most genuinely care about our education.  However, the lines have started to blur a little in one of our physics courses.

It all started a few weeks ago, answered any last questions and left to go turn our homework in.

Fast forward to next week, because I take this seriously.  I went to the professor's office and asked for an explanation.  According to him, I cheated because my classmates copied my work with my permission.  My argument against this was that his syllabus encourages us to work together.  Not only that, but my classmates invited themselves into our study area, copied our work, then submitted it verbatim as it was written on the board.  I continued saying that it isn't my concern what they submit, so I shouldn't be held responsible.  I made sure to make the point that I told my classmates not to copy our work

The advice he gave seems to conflict with everything we had learned up to now: he wants us to stop working as a group.  My classmates are my friends.  I've known most of them for almost 2 years.  We've had all the same classes

Here's where I have my problem. I'm now labelled as a cheater by him.  Almost every chance he gets

An example of above: Today I was working on another physics class homework.  The teacher of this class (call him X) provides excellent lecture notes that we use as a guide during his lecture (he posts them online before class).  Then, so general assumptions have to be made to skip around the math.  Unfortunately, the homework required that I understand the assumption, which I didn't.  So I look the problem up after attempting to solve the problem.  I find the question posted in another professor's online exam, so I look at that.  Professor Y (the one accusing me of cheating), comes over and without understanding the situation, accuses me of copying the answer.  Had he looked, and my solution

This is what annoys me.  He walked into Professor X's office and told him that I was cheating by copying the answers. I was in disbelief that he would do that right in front of me.  I ignored it, he comes back (while I was still trying to understand everything).  He sees that I am still trying to figure everything out, then walks back into Professor X's office and says: ""You know [thegrieved] is out there copying the answers, and you aren't going to do anything about it?"".  Professor X: ""No, it's fine."" Professor Y: ""Well, if I were you, I would give him a 0 (zero) for cheating. That's what I would do.""  Professor Y walks back into his office

Maybe I'm overthinking things, but try to correct myself before I get it stuck in my head.  I've never copied someone else's answer.  I always make sure I understand it.

This is more of a rant than anything.  Feels nice to blow off some steam.  Any suggestions on the situation would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Professor accused me of cheating by allowing classmates to copy my work with my permission (I didn't).  Get labeled as a cheater (I am not).

I took a break for a year to work...great pay (70k) but I hated it, going home and being sick of computers and the lack of human companionship in my life (the only person I had any social interaction with was my girlfriend).  So, I chose to go back into Academia.

Now I am in grad school, but have been working on the material far longer and more in depth than you will probably ever care to, and they expect you to know the material damn well, too.  

The second thing grad school teaches you is how much of a farce the school system is for learning.  Sure, so you should know it too.

I, then study for a day prior to the upcoming midterm or final by reading the book.  Now, unlike many of my colleagues, I am nearly incapable of remembering topic information from years or semesters, prior.  Thanks to both myself and the teachings of school prior I am now capable of applying what I have learned to precisely situations that I was taught, but only if I miraculously remember.

So now I go to classes every day, as soon as I finish up on reading and studying for one class, I have fallen behind by two in the rest...and the worst part is, I feel that I am not retaining anything.

Reading on field related topics is just bad.  I am not sure whether authors are just orders of magnitude smarter than me , but these papers have a way of avoiding the grasp of my understanding.

I'm a recently-graduated Ph.D. student (in the hard sciences) who has a few questions regarding the world of academia and job prospects

Essentially my problem boils down to this: I have no publications and have been to no conferences, well, a less-than-encouraging supervisor. So as soon as I see the request for 'a list of publications' in a position advert, I get very down about my prospects.

If I'm honest, even good researchers within my group that have proven track records had a lot of trouble obtaining grants to start doing their own research. Fashion within science has played a part in the unemployment of at least one researcher I know, and university budget restrictions another. So how the heck do I expect to get constant work when I'm (seemingly) way behind the eight ball already? I know that independent research centres are an option, but they seem to be still reeling a bit from the GFC and recent worldwide economic changes (and since research is by its nature speculative, it seems to me that few are offering positions until they can be assured of work coming in from industry/commercial sectors). I'm at a bit of a loss about where exactly to look, as my training has been so specific I feel that university or university-associated centres are my only choice.

I admit that this sense of despair could all be a kind of post Ph.D. depression, or perhaps any steps sideways you might have taken?

UPDATE: So I've since had a chat to my supervisor/s and we're going to work on a couple of papers over the new year.

Right now my plan is to double major in neuroscience and linguistics (neither of which have good prospects with just a BS) and then go on to grad school for a masters in computational linguistics (UW says this can also applied towards the bioinformatics field), or epidemiology/biostatistics. I also plan to pair this with a minor in Economics - but do employers even care about minors? Does this sound like a viable plan for a good job?

Basically, and they were.  I even measured the same values for my samples that the grad student had with his equivalent samples, even though we had never even met each other.

However, there were still periodic nonsensical bumps in the curve.  We observed this across different samples, and it was not a property of the samples themselves.

An analogy is if you had a machine that measured the mass and volume of different amounts of a material, the lower the density of the sample the greater the discrepancy is when it occurs, such that for very low density materials the machine occasionally measures a negative volume.  So you conclude that those data points are not REAL measurements of the samples that are put into the machine.  They are simply a fault in the machine.

My professor and a few other people could not figure out how to fix the machine so that these steps/bumps were eliminated.  I was graduating soon and we were under pressure from another professor to publish the new manuscript.  I had to replace one curve on a multi-curve figure with the data from the machine.  This was a relatively minor addition among some other major ones I did.

What I ended up doing was deleting those steps/bumps in the machine output and interpolating between them. This kind of data is naturally presented as an interpolated curve anyways, I *was* hiding what we sincerely, and with reason, believed to be unreal data points from the machine.

I did not share the fact that I deleted data points with the reviewers.  It wasn't a planned cover-up type deal.

The journal ""Science Fiction Studies"" comes very close on a few aspects, but isn't close enough. In addition fan studies journals like Participations are getting close, albeit in a different way. 

The reason I ask if you just start them was because I wasn't sure if there was something like IRB that you needed to go through. You obviously can't just *start* original research without IRB approval, so I thought it might also be like that. Sort of like throwing out a CFP and seeing what sticks.

Some benefits to using these instead of MATLAB (aside from the ones mentioned in the video above):

* They are free and open source, provides MATLAB licenses for researchers but they only allow one to install it on work computers and not on personal computers (even if you use your own laptop in the lab). As a PhD student this is constantly a thorn in my side.
* You get the use of python and everything else it comes with. This means access to things like:

I'm starting my second year of a PhD in English at a European university, impoverished adjuncts, and the all around doom-and-gloom has me terrified.

Over the summer, as I thought I was to ""go where the work is."" The truth is, it's important for me to be able to live in a specific region (northeast US/Ontario region, to give you an idea) so that I can be available to my family and friends, who will need me. It's already an enormous drain on me emotionally to be so far removed from them now. I've been told inflexibility about where to live can be an academic career killer.

When I get right down to it, it's not worth it to me. I'm not sure if these sorts of statistics (like [this one](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/08/2012820102749246453.html) that got passed around recently) are hysterical or really the truth. It's hard to differentiate between the alarmists and the realists. I keep trying to remind myself of the reason I started doing this in the first place: I'm good at it, I enjoy it, I honestly believe I have something to contribute, the academic lifestyle (of a successful professor) appeals to me, and I was encouraged by faculty to do so. But reality has set in: no one will ever give a shit about anything I write and funding will almost inevitably dry up as soon as I finish my thesis. More likely, I will end up defaulting to high school teaching and this would be my nightmare. (I did some high school teaching before beginning my PhD and I don't ever want to go back. Ever.)

Really, and no debt. I've also been given a prestigious studentship and according to my supervisor, I've been playing my cards right so far. But law school is tempting me. Before you laugh at the idea of trading the unpredictable academic job market for the unpredictable law job market: I'm well-acquainted with the similar doom-and-gloom articles about the law school world, and my impression is that, if you are a motivated, intelligent student at a top tier law school, you will do well. This seems to be the consensus among a lot of my friends in law school as well as the few recent grads (within the last 5 years) I know. I took a practice LSAT cold and got a competitive score. With some studying

If anyone can give me ANY words of advice... at all... please. I'm dying here. Thanks so much for your time.

I apologize in advance if the details are a little vague.  I've bolded my questions to help you guys out.  Thank you; I really appreciate any and all help!

I have two semesters left for my MS in Computer Science (thesis option).  I'm still at the same state university from which I received my BS degree.  Right now

The agreement isn't set in stone yet, again paid for by my employer plus stipend.  I will only have two years while at my university to earn my PhD.  If for whatever reason I do not complete my PhD in that time period, I will have to finish up my dissertation while working for my employer.  Also, I will have to pay the time I was in school back 1:1.

This is an amazing opportunity that I would like to take advantage of to the fullest extent, unless of course it is a very prestigious school.  How true is this?**  I'm not saying my university is bad, but it is just a public state university.  Nothing too special or prestigious.

You might be wondering why the hell I would care about my CV/resume if my current employer is cool enough to offer paying for all this stuff.  Truth be told, if I could make a list from most to least places I want to live in the US, this would be pretty close to the bottom.  My focus is in machine learning and I'm not interested in becoming a professor, if that helps.  **My second big question: Would getting a PhD make a big difference in what jobs I would be overqualified for as opposed to just having a Masters?**

I guess I left out a few pretty important details I'll list below:

*  I am very interested in my current master's thesis topic and potential PhD dissertation topic

*  I was interested in earning a PhD before this offer even came up

*  My advisor is 110% on board for this and has been very helpful throughout my undergrad and grad research projects so that isn't a problem

*   I am married and my wife will support me if I choose to go for a PhD


**TL;DR:** I'm worried about the cons of getting a PhD given my current situation as described above.  

Please let me know if I'm overlooking anything!  I *believe* I'm fully aware of the difficulties regarding the struggle to attaining a PhD

1340115920.0,v9z5e,Seeking Advice on a Teaching Focused Career at the Post-Secondary Level,Deradius,16,3,7,"This is a bit of a read

I taught high school for a couple of years [and then left that job](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6lye?context=3).  Now I'm finishing up the last year of my PhD in the biomedical sciences.  If all goes according to plan

My life's aspiration is to teach at a small postsecondary institution.  I'm a mediocre researcher and scientist, and naturally talented at teaching.  (It's the one thing I do well, so I hope you'll forgive my candor.  I'm talented, not skilled - there's plenty of room for improvement.)

I think small postsecondary institutions are where the biggest impact can be made.  It is the attendees of these institutions who are

A close friend of mine is a great example.  His family was dirt poor and lived out in the sticks.  He had a work ethic like you wouldn't believe.  He went to high school and held down a job at a gas station at the same time

Because he had to work to help support himself in high school, got top scores, transferred to State U for his last two years, graduated with no debt, and is now rising through the ranks of an accounting firm and helping his family out like he always wanted.

It's these folks who I think could benefit most from what I want to do.  The average State U trust fund kid will score well and make it through whether his/her professors are great or terrible - but that guy who is having trouble staying awake because he was manning a gas station all night?  He needs me.

So I want to teach 100% of the time

As I've gone through my PhD, and stayed active in teaching service by judging science fairs and joining professional societies like the NSTA.  All of this is reflected on my CV.  My research record when I'm done will be mediocre at best - maybe one or if I'm lucky two publications in third-tier journals.  Right now, I have no plans to do a post-doc.

I'd love to TA

**TL;DR**:   I want a job teaching at a small postsecondary institution ('community college')

My questions for AskAcademia are as follows:

1.  How realistic are my goals?  Based on my background (briefly described above)

2.  Individuals who work at small teaching colleges

3.  What am I going to wish I had known five years from now?

4.  How do I avoid getting stuck in the adjunct pool

5.  Do you have any advice for the job interview process?  How do I make a strong

6.  Thoughts on salary negotiations?  How much should I expect to make starting?  Do I just go look up the BLS.gov median for postsecondary instructors ([~62k](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/postsecondary-teachers.htm#tab-5))

7.  How soon should I start looking?   Three or four months before graduation?

8.  Hidden tips for finding a job?  (For example

Then they are sent through a systematic vetting of rigor and due diligence to extract the levels of quality in science and or research performed to produce the academic work.  All of this

And does that make Wikipedia that much different from those academic institutions or would you say that the bottom-up construction of Wikipedia lacks the rigor

If time, at what point would you consider it a source worthy of trust, if you do not already consider it worthy?

Much of this treatment is so subtle that it's difficult to describe and to quantify, while my colleague was totally ignored although she too had greeted the professor.

This past January I left a PhD program with an MS because of disagreements with my advisor. I started grad school in the fall of 09.
About a year ago
I also asked if there was a way to move to a different branch of the school that had a location I preferred.
This effort on my part was met with support from my advisor but ultimately no solution was reached so I decided to tough it out.

At the end of the spring semester of 2011
My research involved developing a method that could be used to base experiments on.
I had developed the method enough so that I could start using it in some experiments to extract useful data.
At around that time my advisor informed me that she had been invited to submit a paper to a journal and would like the paper to be based on my work.
She also told me that there were other projects she could base the paper on if my research didn't pan out.
I informed her that it was a possibility if I was able to obtain meaningful results with my method.
At this time we also submitted my work to be presented at a conference later that year in October.
I should note here that there wasn't a specific outcome we were looking or expecting other than some correlation with the variables our method allowed us to vary.
Basically I had not yet picked a hypothesis to test with my method and my advisor knew this.

I began to collect data using my developed method and searched for any meaningful trends.
While this was going on
My advisor requested and received an extension on the deadline of the paper.
The weekend before the paper was due
Luckily I was able to pull out a few meaningful trends to tell a story for the paper.
While writing
Most notably
At several points while writing I asked for her input on data analysis, etc.
Each time I was met with a response along the lines of ""you need to take ownership of your project
In the end the paper was submitted
Eventually the paper was accepted but I really feel it could have been much better had it not been so rushed.
It could have been avoided had my advisor been willing to respectfully decline an invitation rather than saving face by putting it off on her student (me).

Later that summer
I brought it up that I didn't think she could put me on the right career path.
This was true after all because I didn't want to go into academia.
She however expresed a desire for her students to pursue academia over industry
Thus I suggested that I switch laboratories to work for someone else that could provide me with the proper guidance.
I interviewed with a few other PIs however none of them seemed to want me as a student despite a stellar academic record and strong research skills.
In the end I decided to complete an MS instead and leave at the end of the fall semester.

Remember that conference I submitted my work to?
Well it was accepted for a poster

While I was interviewing with other laboratories
One week during lab meeting
Later that day (a Friday) I get an email from my adivsor asking to meet with her at 4:30pm.
I enter the office and am accused of making her look bad in front of a potential new lab member.
She says she is kicking me out of the lab and I need to move out of the lab offices.
She absolves me of any further obligations to the lab.
The main point she makes is that she needs me to leave so that she can still write a good recommendation for me later.
Mind you

Then comes the conference.
She refuses to finance any part of my trip (no big deal
She asks me to send her a copy of the poster
Essentially what is happening is that she is afraid I will put up the poster and ""not properly represent the lab"".
A good point
We end up both standing at the poster for start of the session we're at but she later leaves to attend talks.
She suggests I leave too because there will be reduced traffic to the poster.
Not five minutes after she leaves
He asks what my plans are after the MS
I also find out he knows my undergrad advisor very well (bingo

Come the end of the semester
I figured it was worth a shot because I could just get a job in industry if it didn't work out.
In March I get a rejection letter. No big deal
Then today I find out from a fellow (former) lab member that my advisor didn't exactly write a glowing recommendation as promised when I left.
Rather she wrote an ""honest"" pros and cons type of letter

End of rant.

There are other things

I could go on but you probably get the picture.

I should also add that I know 90% of the students in her lab are unhappy working for her but feel they are too far into their studies to back out without repurcussions.

I'm very concerned that this will negatively affect my current job prospects should they ask my graduate advisor for a reference. Is there any way to triage this?

Thanks for reading.

**TL;DR:** I took an MS to get out of a PhD program due to my advisor caring more about her reputation than the education of her students.
I believe she is unreasonably providing me with bad references based on our differences rather than my skills or abilities for a position.

Before I apply for the masters program I will have to complete some biology and chem classes that are not part of the psychology program but required for the masters program because its in the Nutrition department. or Path 2 start from scratch as in none of the prerequisites are completed and go for an undergraduate program in Nutrition. On a side note I am in my 30s and have 2 young kids so full time schooling is not an option. Or am I at the point that I have missed to boat for higher education and the time that it would take to complete this would not be worth it so just stick with the new gig with new moms and engorged boobies?

I'm a candidate and nearing completion of my PhD (should be able to defend by Dec but will need to stick around for publication/reviews for a few months). I've been working on a project that is completely novel to the lab that spun off a collaboration. I've put about four years into it


But now I'm having issues with the person taking over my project. He's been here for about a year, since he knows how to do Westerns, to validate the qPCR with Westerns. That didn't work out so well because he could never isolate enough protein and the antibody wasn't as specific as the vendor claimed. After insisting for months that we needed Westerns and getting nowhere with it, he finally threw his hands up last December and moved onto his own subset of the project that I started but had to abandon to strengthen the core of the study.


Since this happened, but he won't budge. He started skipping meetings and times to do work that we agreed upon. ""This isn't my study,"" he says, despite the fact that my boss puts him as second author on all conference abstracts and papers. At one point, I didn't come into work because I needed the morning to do laundry. He flipped out because I wasn't on hand to show him how to use some equipment to run an experiment I developed with code it took me weeks to write and refine. He never asked me if I was free at that time. Never said thanks for any of the help. Just a huge sense of entitlement.


His behavior got so bad that he let some cells die that he was supposed to culture for me while I was away at a conference. OK, I made a stupid joke to my friend which he overheard (""Where's Clay St Pizza?"" ""Clay St."") and said he wanted to ""smack me"" for that. That was uncomfortable. He hasn't earned the right to joke with me like that.


I took this to my boss. I told him about his behavior and that I needed as much help as I could get to finish what needed to be done within his timeline. I told him that this other student's behavior was getting worse and worse and I didn't like my work environment anymore. And my PI was useless. He said that we're ""a team"" and that I don't have the authority to tell this student what to do. I explained that a second author has responsibilities. He said ""tell me if someone isn't doing something they're supposed to do."" How the fuck are they supposed to have to do something if no one with authority is telling them to do it and you just took my little bit of authority away??


I've been ignoring this student and my PI now. He asks for data, because I'm not an asshole. But I feel like something needs to be done or said.


If anyone has been in a similar situation

I just started a post-undergrad position at a top tier university. I was initially led to believe that the job was exactly what I was looking for -- in my area of interest, I was informed that a big part of the job was administrative with much less actual research than I initially thought, but still with some hands-on aspects and the freedom and resources to pursue other avenues of research/education in my free time. I started last week, and found out that this not really at all the case. The job is almost entirely technical/administrative with little to no involvement in the research, and I've been discouraged from seeking out the kind of opportunities I crave or have been told that that's not how things work here. I moved away from my family, my SO, and everyone I know for this job

I can't imagine doing this, if not both. I'm not under any kind of contract for the job or for my house. My general plan as of now is to stick it out at least until Friday before making a decision, but I feel bad not talking to my boss (who hasn't been here since I started working) or the person training me about this. I don't want to waste their time by allowing them to be in the dark and train me if I have no intention of staying, but I feel like I can't say anything until I have made up my mind for sure.

I had a feeling that this was going to happen but I was staying positive about it, and some even went as far as to tell me I would be much happier doing more research (and they were right, although I didn't know how little I'd be involved with until I got here). I just didn't feel like I was in a place to turn down a well-paying job that's technically in my field at a university with such a good reputation, for grad school application purposes.

A bit of background: I'm 19 and have had moderate to severe depression and anxiety for the past 8 or 9 years. I've been in and out of counselling and had a brief stint of normalcy that lasted about a year and a half (ended this past autumn). That normalcy was brought about by me getting serious with my boyfriend who is my rock, and with my life looking so positive and happy all of the negative feelings faded. However, when I started my course, I became incredibly depressed. I realised I hated my course and talked to my advisor about switching out but it was too late in the year.

I managed to do alright (mentally) the first 4 months, and I'd regularly leave the class to cry or take a breather, so I was just fed up. In February I stopped going to classes regularly. I went once a week, then once a fortnight, then once a month, and then we had all of April off and didn't go in during May at all. I spent the time lying in bed or moping about the flat. I missed my final portfolio review for my course, but I have 2 final exams for my other non-course-related subjects next week that I do plan on attending.

But back in September when I went to switch out of my course, not surprised) said that if I pass at a 60-65% for this year then I'm in. Unfortunately, I'm looking at a 40%. I talked to a few friends and my parents and they all suggested I write a letter explaining that I had a bad experience with the course and my depression and I was wondering if I could get the conditions relaxed a bit. The other 2 classes that I took that aren't related to my current course are related to the course I want to switch to, and I have a 70+ in those, so I hope I could use those as proof that I would do well in the new subject.

I've always been really embarrassed about my depression, do you think this will help, or will they just toss my letter aside?

&gt;For the uninitiated: post-hoc theorizing involves creating or revising a hypothesis after you've collected the data; data-fishing entails running a study


I don't know much about life science.  I've only looked at stats collected from computer programs

I've been looking at a bunch of simulation papers.  These are not classical Popperian ""state a hypothesis

With these simulation papers, and hack original algorithms until they are convinced the original algorithm is better than the pre-existing algorithms.  Then they collect data for their original algorithm and they often can get it published if their original algorithm is just a little better than the previously existent stuff.

Clearly they don't have a theory of their new algorithm until they've collected data on the old algorithms.  They don't care about whether their theories are post-hoc

So apparently post-hoc theorizing is bad in the life sciences because it distorts the statistics somehow.  Why?  Why shouldn't one be proud to say, a little statistical generalization could make irrelevant hypotheses appear to be relevant.

1343746776.0,xg949,Another question - this one regarding undergraduate research prior to graduate school.,StrangeOvertones,9,1,15,"Hey all

I've recently been offered another potential research position (just yesterday). The professor who offered it to me is absolutely humongous in his field (polymers) and really likes me. I took his graduate level class this past semester and he's amazing to interact with. The best thing about this position is that it will be a paid research position so I can drop my current job as a math tutor and focus on something that's incredibly intellectually stimulating (at least for me). 

The catch is that I have another research position that I've been at for 1.5 years. This one is also a position that I enjoy immensely however I've been doing this for free (or credit) for the past year and a half including my summers here. I'll have a publication under my belt in this field (tissue engineering) by the time I graduate so it's been a worthwhile experience. 

Is having two research positions detrimental to my future prospects? I'm leaning more towards going to graduate school for polymers because I'm just as interested in it as biomedical engineering and it pays much much MUCH better once I get out with my PhD.

I'm in my first year in a science PhD program at a semi-prestigious institution and I'm currently thinking about re-applying to a different school. 

My two main reasons thinking about to switch:

1, but It affects me as I can't go to conferences I would like and sometimes I have to participate in crappy projects. Not to mention that my thesis should be a co-work with my adviser.

2

It might be possible to tweak my topic toward to my interest but then it became a one-man show(which I can pull out

Apart from my adviser the environment is great

So what I would like to know:
- Have you had similar experience or heard about similar stories and how did they turn out?
- What is the usual practice on this shaky business by either parties? I wouldn't be overly content to read about an applicant who ""sneaks behind"" but I think I would kind of understand it. On the other hand I had heard stories when the contacted professor reported back to the adviser and the story had ended ungratefully..
- General feelings and thoughts?

What I'm referring to is the scope for translations from French into English for:

* Graduates, and all others actively engaged in research who would like access to francophone works and do not yet have an appropriate reading level in French.

* Francophone academics who would like to translate their research into English in order to broaden their readership reach.

* Translations done outside of publishing houses

I graduated with a B.Arts with majors in French and classical languages at the end of 2012 and I have been exploring the opportunities available for a career as a French to English translator, ancient history, archaeology, and all related fields.  What I have found is that translations outside of publishing houses are done, if at all, through a colleague of friend if the researcher/author happens to know someone who is available at the time.  Remuneration is generally small or non-existent.  

Many academics in those fields do have an adequate reading level in French, though circumstance doesn't allow timely access to an English translation?  I would love to fill that void, if the demand was out there, and I am sure there are many others like me.  To date, response to my inquiries have been lukewarm or non-existent.  Perhaps there is no demand, or perhaps I have not inquired with the correct people.  Perhaps even it is the specific fields I am looking into that do not require such translations, though other fields have a more pressing need.

Would you fine people have experiences where you could have used this service




Additionally:  

* I have explored avenues with publishers; work with them is similar to any other employment opportunity - one must be the right person at the right time for the right role.

Hey everyone

I had a meeting with my supervisors this morning and they told me that I should aim to submit around June next year. This was a pleasant surprise to me (I was thinking more like December 2014) but it's also kind of freaked me out that I've only got one more year remaining.

So what should I do/plan for this coming year? I've currently got a draft table of contents for my thesis and have my lit review from my transfer report that I'll expand. I've got some results still to prove but think that shouldn't be an issue before next year.

For academics in the sciences: Part of the reason I studied mathematics was to develop skill in the mathematical sciences. My research area for my master's degree was in Fourier analysis and signal processing, so far no lab has accepted me even as a volunteer because I don't have formal experience in cognitive science or psychology. Even if the lab said its focus is in mathematical modeling or coding, I still found no luck. I do have functional knowledge in cognitive science, although this doesn't seem to be enough. What's a mathematician interested in the sciences to do?

For historians: I also have a degree in musicology with a focus in music history. I did a bit of research here as well, look attractive to a program in general history?

I don't know if this is relevant information, if it helps, I would like to be an academic one day, so industry is not for me.

When applying to graduate school

With respect to fellowships/financial assistance

Reason for asking:
My graduate admissions office stated to list my cumulative GPA from the school I graduated from. This seems opposite to what I interpret *cumulative* to mean and I would like to confirm or refute this point. 


Back-story: 
Since high school (2005), switched majors, and 'took time off' while going to a community college. I have double the credits needed to graduate. With that in mind, I performed poorly at the institutions that I attended previously. Thankfully, I was able to excel at my current university. Since my GPA will drop dramatically, below the 3.5 requirement for most funding, how are students evaluated in this situation?

* Get to work in an area of research that I've wanted to for the past two years or so but haven't been able to.

I don't know what my long term goal is.  I love science, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be a professor.  From a practical standpoint of having a job and making a decent living I'm also open to working in industry, but I prefer the idea of being able to research things more based on what you are interested in rather than what you can just make money off of, so I'm pretty sure I don't want to move to industry just yet.  If I stayed here for a year the next position I would look for would be a standard 1-2 year post doc at a different institution.

I don't know what would happen if I agree to the 1 year then decide to leave in say, 8 months, if I find another job.

I recently discovered my love for biology a year ago while completing my AA. I took a biology course on a whim just to satisfy a science credit. This class changed my life completely; studying habits to the way i viewed the world. i know it sounds cheesy, but i'm at a complete loss when it comes to CALC. I can't really take any upper level courses towards my degree until i complete my math requirements, seeing as they are prerequisites for courses like physics. Staying optimistic, this spring term i started out enrolled in chemistryI and precalc. i was virtually teaching myself everything, i woke up and went to sleep 
doing precalc. I wanted to do this more than anything. I needed to prove to myself that i can learn math. it became a personal goal. i've always talked down about myself possibly having learning abilities and 
here was my chance to defeat that demon. Unfortunately, and on my way back home i had my first panic attack while on the air plane. I continued to stick it out and tried keeping up. It was tough, but for a good 2 weeks i felt better than ever, i was actually understanding and on a path to somewhere. Another set back arose when i had another panic attack while driving, which lead to to the ER. i've been experiencing them everyday since then. i'm afraid to drive now and i've been busing it to class (hr ride). the worst part is i had to dropmy precalc class because of this mess. I just couldn't get back with all that anxiety. I feel so defeated. If i continue to pursue this major i wont graduate until about 3 years or maybe more. Any thoughts about me getting a private tutor and studying everything i'll need to know up until Calc and just testing into CalculusI to get the ball rolling? i'm talking blood sweat and tears type of studying. I'll have till Fall. It's not a matter of finishing quickly. I just really want to get involved in this major already. my interests are in ecology, but who knows, the field is so large i'm not trying to limit myself. 

this is a terrible post, but i feel like i'm not competent enough in the mathematics departnent. i'm only 21, but i exhausted plenty of majors (music ed, elementary ed, etc..), none of which i felt this strongly about. reddit, do you think i should revaluate my choice in major? should i get a tutor while i'm only taking one class and test into calc? has anyone else experienced a discouragement in degree choice because of college level math courses being too difficult?

She went to the professor first (after sending him emails and got the turn around along with a subtle 'too bad') and laid her case. The professor actually relented and sent her an email saying that it must have been an error on the publication side and asked the publication to fix it. The editor was based in NY and was hampered by Hurricane Sandy for a week and never really responded to any email from her. Eventually the gf got annoyed enough and called him. After a *very* lengthy phone call he basically stated that there was nothing they could do and that since it was already published online that the offline magazine had to reflect the same thing.

So which one do I choose? These are both at the same academic institution.

1) research I am interested in with a new lab; position stable only for a couple years until grant money runs out; probably only one published paper coming out of here; novel research

2) research I'm not too interested in but in an established lab; position stable forever as its paid for through the institution (not grants); potentially four published papers coming out of here (4 high profile PIs); research not so ground-breaking

What's more important in terms of marketability in the long term in the sciences? Sheer number of published papers or the substance of papers? And do I choose the stable career or the more risky one? And  would a PI who interacts with me daily be better than four higher profile PIs I hardly interact with?
Please help! 

I can also give advice on how I landed these jobs without too much experience. I did not network at all for these offers. I did it the old fashioned way of sending in my apps/resumes and going into interviews. Any questions welcomed!

In case a bit of background would help: I’m starting my last year of undergrad in two weeks or so, etc.) the prospect of teaching, at any level really, terrifies me, and I’ve essentially ruled out taking a year off to teach English in France through a French government-sponsored program. 

I do want to at least go through with an MA in French literature or comparative literature (likely the former).

1. When applying to an MA program (as opposed to a PhD program)

2. Related to #1, etc.? At the moment I really only have a few very broad topics and authors that I feel drawn to but that I definitely don’t feel that I have a mastery of…in case anyone cares/wants to offer a critique: the fantastic and the absurd, decadence (e.g. Huysmans, though I haven’t read La-bas/novels where the occult features prominently), surrealism both in the 1920’s/1930’s and in contemporary literature (in particular, Roland Topor) and representations of violence in the theater and in modern/contemporary French lit. I guess I’m asking because I really don’t think it would help to wait another year before applying, and was hoping that over the school year and the following summer I’d be able to further develop my knowledge in the subjects that I’d expressed an interest in throughout my SOP.

3. After reading a bunch of posts on gradcafe, but would it make sense to apply to both MA and PhD programs with the intention, in the case of the latter, of quitting after two years with an MA?

4. For a foreign-language program, and that was over a year ago (I spent all of last year studying in France, and I don’t think I can get recommendations from professors there)…meanwhile, the only professor who I feel would be able to write me a relatively detailed letter of recommendation teaches Russian literature… :/

One possibility is to create a separate note-taking system that explicitly itemizes and arranges connections like this as they come up. But this potentially causes a lot of overhead in maintaining one's system of note-taking.

A useful tool along these lines is creating tags. But while tagging notes allows you to pull up content associated with a given tag

What I'm thinking would be useful would be something like a hyperlink system where e.g. the notes document for P could have links to the note documents for X, as in a webpage, would still make the overall structure of connections between documents obscure. What would be *really cool* would be if there were an option to view the entire document system as a directed graph, where each node is a note document and each edge indicates a link between documents. Such a graph could be readily generated automatically, on the fly, by a computer program taking documents with hyperlinks as input. Being able to see the graph visually could provide a really nice bird's-eye-view of all the conceptual links between the notes on takes on papers / ideas / etc. But does such a note-taking visualization program exist?",,,,

I'm double majoring in Chinese and International Studies. Within International Studies, specifically the crossroads of sociology and technology.

Basically I want to look at how institutions, namely globalization and the growth of the Internet. But I'm not sure if there's a specific branch of sociology/IR that this would be filed under for the purposes of finding a grad school program, or even if it's an actual field of study.

My sense is that IR has more to do with the political side of things, but between societies. So sort of a democratization of the whole international stage, a new global public forum. That's what I want to study, I just don't know where exactly it would be classified in academia.

**TL;DR— is ""sociology of international communication"" a thing?**

Let me begin with a bit of my personal background. In high school I excelled at math of all kinds getting top ranking scores on all the AP tests I took, a bad experience on my part). I swapped majors 4 times and by the end of college I graduated with a BS in biochemistry(would have preferred chemistry but I just wanted out for several reasons). College was a challenging time for me, not because of financial issues but my mental health was deteriorating after a break up with my girlfriend, soon to be wife of 5 years. I learned that I had autism, bipolar, agoraphobia, social anxiety, but I failed over and over. I was afraid to talk to my professors, every time I went outside I had a panic attack. I managed to pull out of school with a 3.4 GPA but no references. I tried to get into research groups but I was denied on account of my junior status and funding issues. That is basically my back story leading up to a few questions.

Firstly, i'm thinking of pursuing a second BS in chemical engineering. I have applied to many jobs(100+) with only a few bites that told me I did not have the research experience/qualifications. I want a stable career and I want to do something I am passionate about, so I am thinking about this second BS. Are there Co-op programs for people in my situation who want to earn a degree yet still work? Are these available through school? Lastly, should I try to get a lab tech job right now to fill time and gain some experience? the only 2 jobs i've ever had were an arcade manager and a waiter. People treated me very cruelly and it is hard to get back into public without being terrified of being attacked/hurt emotionally.

If I was flat out told I was not allowed to continue in this major I'm not sure what I would go into-which is part of what I want Reddit's help for. I just looked through my universities majors and can't find exactly what I was looking for. I remember the difference between a first-glimpse at CS and the more in depth reality of CS as being somewhat different-to the point I almost chose a different major based on the initial description.

-I see myself as being an architect

-I can't seem to find a art major that deals with cgi. Good artists of other mediums have trouble as it is, tv, ads, etc. Based off of a class I found the closest I see is Informatics, is this right?

-Staying with my current major. I feel uneasy about this major. I love actually doing directly relevant classes but feel my math will drag me down before i can even graduate. I'm currently paying for a private tutor to help me every few weekends(AKA before tests) and look to khanacademy and the likes for help but I do horrible in exams often

Any advice/comments/questions would be incredibly helpful.

It seems like every time a study is discussed that has been funded by a powerful organization like a corporation or government agency and argues in said organization's favor, I hear that such studies cannot be trusted, usually with the explicit or implicit argument that the scientists involved must be corrupt shills who, in one way or another, lied or distorted the facts in order to ensure that their results benefited the people paying them. Obviously, there are examples of such corruption, such as the fabricated Vioxx studies, there aren't exactly hard numbers on this, for various reasons

Essentially, being a layman, how should I regard these studies? Should I make assumptions about a study's credibility based on its sponsors? Obviously, being a layman, I'm not exactly in a position to understand these studies in their entirety, but assuming that I don't have someone credentialed and trustworthy to interpret the results and discuss possible flaws, I'm not sure how I should regard these studies if I'm, reading an Ars Technica or other news article about their results.

I've got a BA in general science for secondary ed and I'm teaching middle school. I think teaching *might* be OK still

So

However, I think I need a career change.

I'm willing to go back to school, I'd like to do something more rewarding than teaching. 

I used to *love* going to college, I feel good about myself maybe one or two days per month. The job is just killing me emotionally. I need a job where my hard work and intelligence actually has some value. I just have no clue what that job is.

I like science, I can see myself involved in writing textbooks or science books for kids, I can also see myself doing something completely unrelated to science (as long as it pays ok, I think I'd be happy doing any mindless job at this point).

The bottom line is that I spend *way* too much of my time preparing lessons, I'd like to not work overtime for free in the process. I envy the people who work at McDonald's because they show up, do their job, and go home. They get paid for the hours they work, and their customers get what they want and are usually pretty happy. As a teacher, I do extra work and my students are rarely happy.

One of my concerns are the working conditions, I spent some time at eastern asian Universities and the working hours there are mostly incredible up to the point of being ridiculous. A fourteen hour day was the norm, Saturdays were work days and not showing up at least on two sundays a month was also frowned upon. This, however, was basically only _physical_ presence: Even the most senior PhD students worked appalingly inefficient (sleeping for four hours at their desk, wasting away a whole day playing WoW and then pulling an all nighter because the professor is such a mean guy and expects too much), and this is the reason I actually turned down two offers from (also quite prestigeous) Universities in Eastern Asia.
I heard from people doing PhD/PostDoc at other ""big names"" in the US (MIT, Harvard) that that it's very much alike, but most of it is hearsay (I don't know anyone who has first hand experience) and I highly doubt that it's exactly like that.

* Went to college for a year and realized I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life; finished the first year but didn't re-matriculate.

* One ""gap year"" turned into four: landed an internship which turned into a paid position

* Went back to (a much better) university to pursue my BA in political science (minoring in philosophy).

Present day:

I'm now a junior with an excellent GPA and have realized that though the germ for my political passions may have been domestic policy, or an IGO that will allow me to work on international policy issues.

I humbly ask for your collective advice and experience concerning graduate school. I've been working for 7 years since I graduated college and built up some good work experience and make decent money. However, insightful, optimistic, pessimistic, whatever the case may be. I can use all the advice I can get.

Currently I work a steady 40 hour a week job that pays me a decent salary in the Network admin / IT realm. Benefits and vacation included. I have a $337 a month car payment that I would like to try and maintain

Here is my academic circumstance. I graduated from college 7 years ago with my BA in Geography and BA in Geology. Minor in Environmental Studies. My primary areas of interest are geospatial sciences (GIS), and have been exposed to it or working with it in some capacity for about 6 years. Furthermore if I could incorporate GIS into my studies at least to some degree(If I take the Geology path for example), I would be delighted. One thing I think is also important to mention in relation to the geology portion of my interests...there are a decent amount of geology courses I would have taken if it were my primary major, but since I needed to fill 36 credit hours after my geography major, I decided to take the BA of geology. It was a mistake in hindsight that I didn't just go for my BS of Geology, but I am willing to do what it takes to remedy it. Courses that in my opinion I lack that I feel might hurt me include but are not limited to: Mineralogy, Stratigraphy &amp; Sedimentation, a Geology field course

So much for background and interests. I have about $37k in student loan debt remaining at this point,utils,insurance). I am willing to take out some loans if need be for school, but I would like to somehow try and work and go to school...even if it’s just part time work. Some source of income would be preferable to none.

As for my past academic records, was a 2.734. I don’t know if it matters really, but my major coursework in Geography and Geology was easily above a 3.0 average at all times. Once I was able to focus on my majors, everything improved substantially. Also, as I said, this was 7 years ago. So much has changed in terms of motivation, focus, maturity

Also I understand that I need to take the GRE, preparing for it, what to study, how to study, experiences with it, etc... would be very much appreciated.

Finally
*“When applying, figure out what kind of research you would like to do, and find someone at an institution that is doing similar research.“*
To what degree does that hold validity in your experience? Not that I doubt what he said

Ok Reddit, but I really just want to try and lay out in front of me what I am up against and then see if I can pull it off. ANY advice, testimony, stories, experiences, contacts, links, etc...that you would care to share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time.

1363300610.0,1abayx,Questions about graduate school and application process from an applied math and physics undergrad,RuffleBee,8,2,4,"Hi AskAcademia! A little background info: I am currently a sophomore at a  tier 1 research university (UW-Madison) and in the past year have very heavily been considering attending graduate school to try and get my PhD. I originally was studying Computer Engineering but I quickly realized that I was more interested in continuing my education rather than entering the job field right out of college like most of my peers in the program intend to do. I thought about it very heavily this past year and decided that I wanted to continue my education and if fate allows, almost certainly in Physics but possibly Math. I have had very little luck talking to my math advisors about grad school and I haven't been able to meet with my physics adviser because he's been out of the country. I'm really just trying to figure out what I need to be doing at this point in my college education to ensure that I will have a strong application to graduate school. Here are most of the questions I've had

1) When do I need to start finding research experience? Am I already behind if I don't have any experience and I'm a sophomore? What are the best ways to find research opportunities? Can I really just ask a professor to do research with them, or do I need to go out and find them myself? Can anybody do research, or do I need prior experience/more education? How much experience is needed to make a grad school app appealing? What should I expect out of undergrad research in terms of the work I'd be doing and my overall involvement in the research?

2) Who are the best candidates for getting letters of reccommendation? If I don't know any professors or researchers around campus, or are they generally accustomed to meeting new undergrads?

3) Do I need to be published to get into a good grad school? Will I be able to find oppurtunities to get published in my more advanced coursework, or will a professor be able to help me along the way? If I want to get into a good grad school, do I NEED to write a senior thesis?

4) What is a good GPA for applying to grad school? Will anything less than a 3.75 disqualify me from getting into top tier schools? What kinds of things make a grad school app very strong? Should I pretty much accept that I won't be able to get into a top tier school because I only recently made the decision to pursue grad school? Is there still hope for me eventhough my grades aren't perfect (3.745 GPA) and I don't have any research or writing experience yet

5) What do I do if I don't get accepted anywhere? Do I just try to find more research opportunities and try again next year? Is it a bad sign if I don't get accepted to a grad school the first year after graduation? Will my undergradute degree be enough to get a paid research position that will get me through the year

6) Is it enough to have the drive and desire to pursue a PhD

I'm sorry if some of these questions seem a bit foolish. I'm only a sophomore and I haven't gotten much serious information about grad school and what it takes to get there so I'm just trying to get as much information as I can from people who have already gone through the application process.

For what its worth I thought I wrote good essays.
I'd imagine good recommendations. 

I know I'm not headed for ""ivy"" school

So my question is how much more beneficial would an REU be to an internship? My feeling tells be an REU would be way better because I'd image grad schools don't care about internships and If I decide to get a job and REU would still look pretty good on my CV. 


My lack of success with these REUs is really making me question my potential as an academic

Hello
I am 22 years old and have just begun grad school. A problem

I completed a major in Linguistics and a minor in Communication Sciences and Disorders. I settled into this major/minor through sort of a long process of trial and error and enjoyed all of the classes I took under Linguistics a lot. But while they were fascinating, TESOL - did not interest me as much as simply the ""how-language-works"" part, I guess. I was eventually introduced to the prospect of becoming a speech-language pathologist and heavily considered it because at the time I felt that I would be applying the concepts I'd previously learned in linguistics towards therapy, as well as the fact that the job market for SLPs appears to be very good. Over time I grew complacent in this certainty, and it was only in the last semester of my senior year, with grad school looming on the horizon, that I began having doubts. I realise now that there's a large part of me that is unsatisfied with the career path (even though I still find the subject matter interesting), physics (especially optical and particle)

The issue with this is that historically I've been much better with language than math or physics in high school, for example, to test the waters. I would be willing to learn - if anything, the possibility I'd struggle would only spur me to keep trying. However, I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm coming across all of these career path considerations so late of my own fault. My peers are all certain that SLPs are what they're going to be, and I've been accepted into (and, hell, but I can't put my fears to rest. I've spoken to an undergrad career counselor and my grad school advisor, to my grad school advisor telling me that it's an intense program and that I have to really *want* it for any hope of completion.

I was looking forward to completing undergrad with minimal loans and entering grad school with a mostly clean slate. However, further atop rent payments unless I move away from my significant other to go back home. Needless to say I would need a job: my grad advisor said she would take me up as a grad assistant only if I decided to remain in the program, which only adds incentive to uncertainty. More loans may be required in the meantime in my job search, so I'm disheartened seeing the clean slate goal I'd worked towards slowly fall to ruin.

**So I have a few questions:** what do you recommend I do - remain in the program and use the future employment to go back to school? Leave now? Defer admission? Is a loan unavoidable at this point? And would I send myself back at least 2-3 years if I change course?

**If anyone has any knowledge about the fields I mentioned considering:** what is the job market like for any of them? Do you know of any companies/places I should specifically look into? What is the coursework / daily job work like? Would it help me to speak to professors involved in those fields at the university; would they have anything to tell me that I might not already know?

Hi, though I floated around in my subject matter for quite a bit. At first I wanted to do bioinformatics - I did some coursework, loved it, then grew tired of it. Then I was really into brains. I did some coursework, loved it - then I did some lab work and hated it. I also had lasting love affairs with media studies, sociology, philosophy

When I graduated, and befriended the poli sci grad students. My work was mildly interesting (at best), but I grew really fascinated with the grad students' projects. The lab did very data heavy empirical work with some really cutting edge modeling. I worked out a transition from the admin side of things to becoming a research assistant to the grad students. I loved the work that I did for them. I got to satisfy many of my academic 'needs' such as doing math, coding, and thinking about behavior and the law.

Anyway

But, it's academia.

**Questions actually start here**


I have a few worries about going back to school

* I've been very academically fickle in the past, and see if I still yearn for it after a year or two?

* Poli sci was attractive because I got to do math with an interesting subject matter. I *may* be more excited about the math behind poli sci than the poli sci itself. I'm also very interested in the private sector applications of the modeling skills I would pick up during the phd process and am realistic about the slim probabilities of successfully becoming a professor. Is this the wrong kind of mindset?

* I would most likely go back to my undergrad institution for grad school. This is due to strong connections with the faculty in the poli sci department who are willing to look beyond my not 3.5+ gpa. I also know with whom I would want to work with

* I also know what the conditions of the grad students at my alma mater are. They live pretty nice lives, but I haven't seen anything else, so I don't know how this compares. How does one go about learning more about the day-to-day life of grad students in other universities?",,False,,t5_2sakj,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/whd8m/grad_school_for_the_wrong_reasons/

Since I am not from the US

First off, minor is (public) law, but my faculty is very interdisciplinary, so I also had some economics classes. A B.A. here lasts three years, i.e. six semesters. I just returned from an exchange semester somewhere else in Europe which was officially labeled as a vacation semester (to avoid tuition fees etc. - the university suggested to do that). 

I have the choice now of finishing within the next semester, factually studying seven then, officially six. This is relevant because if we officially study more than six semesters, tuition fees rise. 

I don't really know now what is preferable. Reasons why I think studying seven semesters would be a good idea:

* since the faculty is interdisciplinary I lack a certain amount of in-depth knowledge in some areas
* no further tuition fees because I'm legally not extending my B.A.
* a unique chance being at university to develop further as a scholar and a person so I should not rush through it as fast as possible but use the opportunity to become a GOOD scholar
* I could take more methodology/research methods classes which I think are very important
* I could further improve my grades (I do not know how that GPA works, 1 being the best, my average is 1.7 which is already quite good, but it could be better still)
* more time for language proficiency that will benefit me later (mainly looking at French here)
* time for two internships (one in the summer and one next year in the summer between my B.A. and M.A.)

I'm definitely sure I want to go on with an M.A. (Or MSc for that matter)

On the other hand

So I think the basic question is this: should I try to finish my B.A. as fast as possible because it will look odd/strange/weak to further potential employers if I took ""extra time""

From my wording you can probably already guess to what choice I tend more

1314823329.0,k0kq5,Trying not to fuck up the Ph.D. dismount,ThrownawayTaco,12,6,14,"This is long

I met my wife while studying at Derp State University. My wife and her family (to whom she is very attached) are from Derpville, we had a pact that wherever we moved post-Ph.D. it would be closer to Derpville than where we are now. In spite of this broadly-worded agreement, she never let it out of her heart that somehow we would end up back in Derpville. This desire of hers only burned hotter when we learned that several professors in the Geology department (both of whom share my specialty), would be retiring about the time I finished my Ph.D.

Six years have gone by. We have two children. Having kids has changed my priorities away from long field seasons and constant travel and towards stability. Together, and have just been offered a good, intellectually-stimulating and highly lucrative job with a company I like in a city I can tolerate (and may even like). This city is, I will add, 3 times closer to Derpville than our current home, thus meeting the terms of our original contract.

Still, to give talks to conferences, etc. But, ultimately I took the job offer. It is a good, stable job which will allow a lot of time for me to hang out with my family. I will have my evenings and weekends to do with as I please, and I can largely leave my work at work. Also the pay is almost exactly twice the average starting salary for an assistant professor in the geosciences.  Immediately after sending the email which said I accepted the job in industry I had the overwhelming feeling that I had made the right choice. Life was good. I started planning what to do with all the cash, and to dream of an early retirement. My wife was bummed that we weren’t ending up back in Derpville

24 hours later, Dr. X of Derp State is retiring, and they are probably looking for a replacement in his(my) specialty. Derp State is pretty low-profile, and my sense is that my credentials/publication record are sufficient to be competitive for the job, even sans post-Doc. If I don’t apply for this job my wife will never forgive me. So, the decision I thought was made now has to be made all over again. The thick academic job application I thought I had avoided now has to be written.

I honestly think I have it in me to do the academic thing if I had to. I understand the grant writing process, etc. I am just no longer as sure as I once was that I would enjoy it. Sure I love (passionately love)fieldwork, but I understand how hard it is to get funding for field-based geology. I am a pretty good teacher, and I am interested in the pedagogy of teaching science. That being said teaching has never driven me the way I see it driving some of my peers.
But living in Derpville would be good for my marriage, which means more of a social life for yours truly.

So

* Derp State has a two classes a semester teaching expectation from all faculty. How much of my life would I expect to spend teaching/grading/prepping?

* Approximately how many hours does an assistant professor put in every week

* (Optional) Knowing what you know now

tl/dr: Unbelievably whiny Ph.D. student complaining about have too many job opportunities. 


**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback. Yesterday I emailed my old mentor at Derp State. He said told me that the position I am interested in applying for isn't being posted until next fall, after talking to my old adviser, I do not expect to get the gig (I still think I am competitive, but I am thinking the odds of getting hired are still only 10-25%, depending on the strength of the applicant pool), so it will likely be a non-issue in my career. And if by some fluke I apply and get hired, maybe by that time I will see that Industry isn't that rad after all. I have a strong suspicion I am viewing industry through rose-colored glasses at the moment.

CS and engineering would interest me, but I'm not sure I can switch to those at this point partly because I'm kind of tied down by this ROTC contract and my school has practically no engineering or CS. Psychology interests me, and in fact I'd been thinking of going for Psychiatry in med school. I could still switch to that major, but I'm not sure I have the interpersonal skills for clinical work and I have no idea what other profitable fields are out there.

I've really only found my love of research in the past couple years yet my GPA is shit. My nutrition GPA is decent at about a 3.5 and I've been able to get a ton of research experience. I know that I may have screwed myself over early in undergrad. I'll be a late graduate because of a major change but how the hell do I fix this? Would everyone suggest coming back and fixing the GPA or just take the GRE and attempt to go into industry? I just hate that I feel like I found my passion too late and don't know what to do....

I know the person I work with in the lab has like 6 publications and said that he's talked to an advisor at his undergrad school and they've basically said he would have no problem getting in

EDIT [Academic Question]: My major isn't actually nutrition because at my school that doesn't exist so I'm just a plain Animal Science major.

I graduated from St. John's College in May and am currently taking some time off before I actually apply to grad school.  (For what it's worth

St. John's was an excellent introduction to philosophy, while I do have a background in philosophy in a variety of fields, it lacks a specific focus and a modern, updated vocabulary to help me to properly define my interests.  At least, this is how I feel about it.  Thus, while I'm fascinated by language, particularly the thought of Wittgenstein (with whom I'm quite familiar), Austin, and I feel that ""philosophy of language"" is too vague and general a phrase to actually be helpful to me.  Heck, but I have no idea how to factor those into my main interest (Phil. Lang.); my understanding is that MAs and beyond are very specific

So if anyone has any advice/pointers regarding finding a program and/or narrowing down my interests, than how academia treats of those sources after the fact (by applying certain classifications, fitting them into particular historical/philosophical movements, and so forth).  At this point it also sounds like I'm asking for someone more experienced with the whole grad school application process to advise me on a set of criteria I could use in my research, so if anyone has any pointers there as well, that'd be great.  Typically I've been looking at types of programs offered and geographical location (which I do feel are important criteria), but I can't help but think that I should try to find a specific professor whose research aligns with my own interests.  However, I have no idea how to go about finding such a professor.
