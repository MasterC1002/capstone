Question, Method, Test, Analysis, Conclude.

**In Mythbusters they subtly follow this perfectly**
****
Question: The myth. Is this possible

Hypothesis: The hypothesis is what happened in the myth

Prediction: They often make a prediction as to what they think will happen

Method/materials: They state exactly what they are doing and with what materials

Test: Normally a small scale test

Analysis: They analyse what they've done and what happened. (Talk about it after the test)

Conclusion: When they conclude they normally go up to a larger scale

THEY DID IT WRONG

The Myth is that when you break a ship's mooring line

Because they tested the wrong thing. 

In their eagerness to dial it to 11, Kevlar ropes don't do it, and wire ropes certainly don't do it. 

Nylon is used for mooring lines *because* they stretch - it gives some buffering to the force holding the ship to the dock. If they just broke

If you need a mental image of this - it would be like testing if a rubber band can hurt your finger when it breaks

By the way, not the rope snapping. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX19sAudmic) is a video of what it looks like when an arresting wire fails.

When I was a kid in the 90's one of the top football players was the Brazilian player Roberto Carlos. He played for some of the best clubs in Europe and was famous for his tremendously powerful and precise free kicks.

I believe it was based on the power of his free kicks that the myth was born. The myth went that he, it was not just the goal falling apart because of poor construction, but the crossbar actually cracking, break, being destroyed, due to the shear stress. 

Now, etc.. But, searching the web, I can see that I am not the only one who's heard of this. Furthermore, I believe that anyone who has played football, or is interested in football, have heard of either this myth or similar. 

So, material of the football, material of the crossbar, friction (is the goal fixed into the ground), and of course power. Can it be done? And, can it be done by a human?",,self,,

The scenario is: a person trapped in a coffin 6 feet under has to punch a hole through the lid of the coffin from about three inches away and then climb out and through the dirt to the surface.  
Since Grant takes charge on the myth, they also don't punch at their target, they try to punch THROUGH their target...

So many shows since they got popular are over-the-top dumb and pure entertainment but there is fun stuff there in what they do. That's why I watch (and get angry when they are so dumb: surely that is part of the plot). But this was a very simple ""myth"" that

If you haven't yet then go seek out [The Bridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799954/) ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_\(2006_film\))). It's very moving and absolutely horrifying.

It left me thinking that Jamie and Adam are either getting really dumb or that the producer of the show is having thing do pointless stuff just to get people to complain and get more buzz going.

dodging a snipers bullet for one could be possible. They just failed to test any thing in that myth correctly. 
No night testing ( fire can be seen better at night no way ).  THe USMC has been using Night vision scopes since Vietnam. 
Shooting at 500 yards max they kept talking about how far that was but 500 yards with lapua 7.62x51 or 8.6x70 round

Speaking of walking why did they not test out side profiles? 

TLDR: no night testing

As far as the other 2 ""myths"" Will adding a ~~Duct tape~~ stronger and lighter material to an airplane then what they had 60 years ago work? 

It was less the 10lbs and they made it sound like a big deal

Concrete thicker then water? ( said in a zoidberg voice )  hold on concrete will do more damage then hitting water when at the same height. I think every one already new that. The actual myth is can water do the same damage as concrete which is yes. jumping from 200 feet and landing in water is the same as jumping 40 feet and landing on concrete.
