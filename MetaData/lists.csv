In my years working in kitchens I have seen hundreds come and go; eager at the start but quickly disenchanted and just as eager to get out. Only a small percentage of people who walk into the world of gastronomy stay there once faced with this harsh environment.

Below is a list that I compiled of all the realities  of day to day life as a chef

 

What you can expect from making a living in a professional kitchen:

1. You'll almost always have open wounds on your hands and arms.

2. You'll never meet new people because your social life deteriorates into non-existence.

3. You'll find it hard to start relationships because alone time will become a precious thing.
4. You'll lose your social skills.
5. Your sense of humour will degrade into the politically incorrect and socially unacceptable.
6. You'll eventually start swearing like a sailor and you won't even notice yourself doing it.
7. You'll turn into an anorak/monomaniac and always turn all conversations back to food.
8. You'll earn a pittance for years/decades.
9. You'll either lose a vast amount of weight or gain a vast amount of weight.
10. You'll never ever have a tan ever again.
11. You won't become famous.
12. You'll develop a habit, alcohol, gambling, cannabis, cocaine, or even red bull.
13. Your feet will get destroyed.
14. Your back will get destroyed.
15. Your hands will get destroyed.
16. You'll live in a constant state of sleep deprivation
17. You'll have to ask your friends to plan everything around your schedule
18. You'll become of a very highly strung nature.
19. You'll become more prone to temper flare ups.
20. Your awareness of other people's lack of efficiency and common sense will increase and your tolerance of it will decrease.
21. You'll spend the largest part of your life cooped up in a small, a lot of noise, humidity, no natural light and no windows, with a small group of people who will become your only social interactions.
22. You will work longer hours than you ever imagined possible or thought legal.
23. You will spend all your waking hours on your feet
24. Your shortest work days will be longer than most people's longest, will be longer than the average person is awake in a day.
25. You will not cook gourmet dinners at home. You'll be too tired
26. You will probably start eating mostly fast food and cheap instant noodles.
27. You will be the subject of abuse, it will be as a form of entertainment.
28. You will end up spending so much time at work that your colleagues will know you better than your partner/family/friends do.
29. You will meet and form strong bonds with types of people whom you'd previously never even have imagined sharing conversations with.
30. You will be in a constant state of stress.
31. You will never be irreplaceable and will be expected to constantly give 110%.
32. You will always be exhausted.
33. You will not be allowed to call in sick for a hangover.
34. You will be expected to place your work before any other part of your life in your list of priorities.
35. You will never be congratulated on your work.
36. You will be expected to treat your superiors as absolute masters and never answer back, or show any other type of insubordination, even if you know that they are in the wrong or feel as if their behaviour towards you is unacceptable.
37. It will become very difficult to watch friends cook.
38. Your mum will stop cooking for you because she feels embarrassed.
39. You will be expected to cook for family gatherings such as Christmas EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Luckily
40. At least one year out of two, New Year's Eve, Easter, Valentine's day, Mother's day, Father's day, bank holidays, your birthday
41. You will have to work many years in menial positions before attaining any level of authority in the workplace.
42. The better the restaurant is, the more unhealthy your lifestyle will  become, the more likely you will be to develop a habit, the more competitive the people around you will become, the less sleep you'll get, the less you'll eat etc.
43. You will constantly make mistakes
44. If you are a woman, belittlement and remarks about your menstrual cycle.
45. None of your friends or family will understand what is involved in your work and you will never be able to make them understand.
46. You will spend vast amounts of money on equipment, which will leave you with not much money for other things.
47. You will develop a creepy obsession with knives.
48. If you are a pastry chef
49. You will get a rash in your arse crack from the mixture of heat, will mostly always be slimy and itchy and will be there most of the time.
