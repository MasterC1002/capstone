I've been thinking about the common image of The Scientist: they are Einstein-writ-large, brilliant, willing to listen to contrary views, etc. You'll hear that from most scientists today, and I'll take them at their word: many scientists are, or at least think they are, paragons of virtue. Our first kind of scientist is then the *self-critical scientist*: they've thought of -- and addressed -- all the objections long before they've decided to publish, etc.

From here, I don't think it exists.

**II.**

Of course, indifferent to contrary views, that came out of Kuhn's work in the 60's. This is our second kind of scientist: *the dogmatic scientist*: they've come up with a brilliant idea, but will never change. 

This too leads to a community of dogmatists

I don't know if that's possible. In fact, then, would mirror the Christian church's long history of schisms; scientific 'progress' would be little more than competing fads; any test of a theory would be irrelevant. Or, instead of constant schisms, there might be a hegemonic authority, where everyone tows the party line. Either option would be unwelcome.

**III.**

However, and will eventually adjust their views, etc. There's no need for self-criticism: this third kind of scientist requires only doubt. Our third kind of scientist, then, is *the doubting scientist*: even if they don't take the time to critically evaluate their own theories, they're willing to listen (somewhat) to others. 

There's only so many criticisms people can take before they acknowledge that they've made a mistake. Luckily, *scientists need only doubt*. The collective actions of a doubting community produces a self-critical whole.",,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,

&gt;**""Has the Naturalistic Approach to the Philosophy of Science Shed Any Light on Its Central Problems?""**


-------

The rules of the contest? NO RULES. Everything is open ... but everything comes at a cost:

1. Remember: there's no word limit or word minimum

2. Please cite your sources. If it's clear that you're just ripping off someone else (or just blatantly stealing papers) without giving some credit

3. How do you submit? Just leave it as a comment on this page. You can either make a self-post elsewhere and link back to it, your hog, or you log.

4. Extra points will be arbitrarily given by the secret judges for tough criticisms of other people's papers and extra-extra points will be given for powerful defenses of your position. Double-extra secret points will be awarded for use of the secret word of the day. Imaginary points will also be factored, or word games will win a booby prize (TBA). (If you produce a film of you striking a bust or statue of a famous philosopher or scientist squarely with a ping-pong ball from at least six feet, your essay will be given special consideration. Writing a song will help. Remember: NO RULES.)

5. After we've received a large enough number of submissions

Oh ... and another thing:

I'm giving one other possible way to compete in the contest. Give your most novel answer to the problem facing William K. Clifford's Principle

----------

&gt;**What sufficient evidence is there for Clifford's Principle?** Would it not be wrong, **resolve the regress the best you can!**

---------

Now on the prizes: the winner of the contest (and possibly the runner-up?) will receive at no cost to them

1. ""[Popper Selections](http://www.amazon.com/Popper-Selections-Sir-Karl-Raimund/dp/0691020310)""

2. ""[Elementary Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Logic-W-V-Quine/dp/0674244516/)"" (revised edition)

The official story has always been that Schlick was assassinated by a ""crazed"" student but Eckehart Koehler has long had a more intriguing theory. He believes that while the trigger was indeed pulled by [Johann Nelboeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Nelb%C3%B6ck), already known to be unstable, about a (false) Schlick conspiracy to have Nelboeck dismissed from his teaching position at a Vienna school. The death threats Schlick had received from Nelboeck whose girlfriend he believed was having an affair with Schlick were widely known at the time.

Eckehart Koehler wrote a paper in 1968 supporting his theory about Schlick's assassination which he kindly gave me an English translation of. I was left utterly gobsmacked by the audacity of the claims, and he generously agreed.

Logician [Harvey Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Friedman) (who by the way is in the Guinness Book of Records for being the world's youngest professor) recently constructed a [set of somewhat ""tame"" arithmetic statements](http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~friedman/pdf/UnprovThms052605.pdf) unprovable from Peano axioms that appear to be more consequential for everyday mathematicians.

The consequences for physicists

&gt; In the case of physics,"" says theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey. ""But mathematics and physics are both open systems with many uncertainties, and I do not see the uncertainties as being the same for both."" The clocks won't stop or apples cease to fall just because there are questions we cannot answer about numbers.

&gt; The most severe implications are philosophical. The result means that the rules we use to manipulate numbers cannot be assumed to represent the pure and perfect truth. Rather, but at the same time manifestly incomplete and subject to continuous and possibly radical reappraisal as fresh information comes in. The rules we use to manipulate numbers might not be universal truths, but just our best approximation of reality.

1299475003.0,fytdw,Why I don't like 'Falsifiability': A Rant,drunkentune,108,21,71,"Recently, seeing as it provides a good opportunity to clear up some misconceptions.

**I. Some background**

First, see the word and immediately link it to the Logical Positivist theory of meaning, verificationism. No. That simply won't do. It pigeonholes the entire enterprise from the beginning. This is why I think W.W. Bartley's work on Comprehensively Critical Rationalism is an improvement on falsificationism, in that it makes explicit the radical nature of the program: it extends Kant's own critical philosophy to epistemology. We do away with support entirely.

The criterion of falsifiability, and yet are compatible with any state of affairs, or (2) as a *criticism* of actions taken to surreptitiously *protect* theories from testing through increasingly *ad hoc* adjustments.

With that out of the way

**II. Where I get increasingly angry**

&gt;But then I started to read Popper’s work carefully

When I see this type of language, then perhaps Popper's criterion of science is not scientific! 

... yes. That is true. It's *not* scientific. No one claims that the criterion of falsifiability is scientific, it's a *meaningful* statement, which sets it apart from the Logical Positivists: it's a criticism of theories that claim to make predictions while in fact they make nothing of the sort. But if we want to talk about 'successful science', I don't know about you, but I immediately think of what inspired Popper in the first place: Einstein's revolutionary theories and their highly conjectural (and highly testable) nature. Are his theories not 'successful science'?

&gt;For one thing

In that case, then I weep for the future: something has been lost along the way, something important, involving the constant criticism of competing hypotheses. Of course, I don't believe that for a minute. Criticism is rampant in science. Or, at least I *hope* it is.

**III. Here's a break for you to rest your eyes**

&gt;He describes science as if it was skeet-shooting

What? I fear that Goldstein has not ""read Popper's work carefully"", one goal might be to eliminate error, and the only way I know to eliminate error is to work as hard as we can to show ourselves wrong: you've got to be very critical of your ideas if you want to get them published. If you aren't critical, there's a scientist more than willing to criticize their failings for you and make you look like an ass. Another goal in science might be to approximate interesting truths. Again, I know of no other way of getting closer to the truth than looking for our mistakes. Or perhaps other goals may be to problem-solve, or to *learn* from our mistakes, or to see where exactly nature limits our imagination!

&gt;Scientists rarely write the way that Popper says they should

Long ago, provide details on their theory on how to solve the problem situation and how this theory could be tested, and the results of their experiments, *positive or negative*. 

If scientists have not adopted these reforms, came from other people within the philosophy of science for some time, then I see only a problem for scientists. 

And no

**IV. Here's another break**

&gt;Also, jettison a theory as soon as a disconfirming datum comes in.

Ok. Now we get to the point where I usually start tugging at my hair. Breathe

If a theory (T) *appears* to contradict an experiment (~E), you'd know that either (1) T is false, (2) ~E is false, or (3) T and ~E are false. It's really, really, really, really basic. Really.

So? This means that when we encounter ~E, an auxiliary hypothesis could reconcile their differences, etc. This means that falsifications are *never conclusive*. Let me say that again: *never conclusive*. 

What stands out in the entire Critical Rationalist literature is that they stress this point repeatedly: all observation is theory-laden! In fact, perhaps it comes from the term 'falsification' and all the misconceptions that stem from it. I'll leave it up to you to decide.

&gt;Another problem with the falsifiability criterion is that I have seen it  become a blunt instrument

Then bring it up with the idiots that think the criterion is supposed to end debate

**V. What?**

&gt;Popper tried to use it to discredit not only Marxism and Freudianism as scientific theories but also Darwin’s theory of natural selection—a position that only a creationist could hold today.

[Oh come on!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_9zH9Q44o) This is just ... just ... flagrantly dishonest. Popper never attempted to 'discredit' evolution. He said it was one of the most valuable theory designed in the natural sciences: he thought at the time, but *it was not directly testable*. Popper wrote extensively on the importance of metaphysical research programs in science. Why does Goldstein say something so pigheaded? I'll put money on the term 'falsification'. 

Oh, saying ""I have in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological', and I have tried to explain how the theory of natural selection could be untestable ... and yet of great scientific interest. ... Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and the logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation"".

&gt;I have seen scientists claim that major theories in contemporary cosmology and physics are not “science” because they can’t think of a simple test that would falsify them.

Bring it up with the scientists

&gt;But such is the godlike authority of Popper that his is the one theory that can never be falsified!

What? She can't really? Huh?

&gt;Finally

OK. I'm done. I can't keep this up. Is she serious?

&gt;It allows believers to protect their pet theories by saying that they can’t be, just because they’re clearly not scientific theories. Take the theory that there’s an omnipotent, omniscient, beneficent God. It may not be a scientific hypothesis, but it seems to me to be eminently falsifiable; in fact, it seems to have been amply falsified.

[Lee Smolin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin) wrote a book in 2006, but at the same time, rendered it beyond experimental falsification. In Smolin's opinion, this can hardly be called science. (Some related falsifiability drama can be found [here](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=468)).

**I highly recommend listening to [this podcast](http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/thinkaboutscience_20080612_6202.mp3) of an interview with Smolin in Canada CBC's ""How to Think about Science"" series.** In addition

Smolin himself is no mere academic philosopher. He is working on his own alternative to string theory called [loop quantum gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity) which posits that the space-time itself is divided into elemental quanta of volume. A big fan of Einstein, he is a hardcore Leibnizian denying the fundamentalism of symmetry in physics and advocating [the principle of sufficient reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason).

His book traces physics as an institution from the philosophical tradition of Einstein

I have heard from enough modern physicists now (in the offline world) whose mathematical craftsmanship would easily put my rusty skills to shame, and do not question the theories which pay their salaries beyond to what extent they agree with experimental evidence.  Occasionally the theory bandwagon they are riding, combined with their individual problem solving genius bring them significant honours, but often owing in my opinion, to a massive dose of luck.  I know Smolin is bound to be controversial on here, but personally I am just thankful thinkers like him still dare to prod the assumptions behind the conventional wisdom and put the current foundations of physics in context for the rest of us.",,,,

Scientifically examining the brain seems to make conceiving of free will difficult. All human behaviour is apparently reducible to more or less conscious brain processes.

My question, is this: What would a free willed brain look like? Which, I guess, is another way of asking: If human beings did have free will, would science be able to detect it? Because it seems to me - and this may reflect a not particularly sophisticated philosophy of science on my part - that science in principle can only detect objective, repeatable, law-like phenomena. If free will _does_ exist in some capacity, unique and non-repeatable in its manifestation. And therefore it would lie outside the reach of scientific investigation. Obviously

Does this make any sense? I ask because there are people here much smarter than I and I'd like to learn more. 

So

(I know one of the problems of this whole discussion is that no one quite knows what ""free will"" is supposed to mean. I find the ""free"" part especially problematic, that free will must be completely free and unconstrained in order to be coherent. I don't think that's necessary. My personal take is quite minimal and I prefer to use something like ""subjective agency"" instead of ""free will"". In light of modern psychology, it's impossible to view the will in ways that don't take into account its embeddedness in physiological and cultural environments. But I thought it would be most conducive to the discussion just to use ""free will"" and offer this disclaimer, instead of using less familiar terms.)",,False,,False,t3_k3jqh

2373 readers of this subreddit now. Phew. Seemed just like yesterday when we were [thanking everyone and congratulating ourselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/related/am2cz/philosophyofscience_subreddit_reaches_1000_users/) on reaching 1000 subscribers. Thanks to everyone for your readership and continued support. Your readership and participation is what makes this subreddit work.

But with increased readership comes diversity and we thought it was about time we arranged the subreddit a little better for all readers. As you can see

We have also discussed creating an introduction post for those readers who have never had any exposure to the study of the philosophy of science before and are wondering what it is all about.  We will then link to this post from the main subreddit description. The text of this post will (eventually) be that introduction post.

What other links and information did you find useful when you began to learn about what the philosophy of science is all about? Perhaps you still aren't really sure? What would you *like* to see in this case? Bear in mind our readers come from many educational and science backgrounds - many from mathematics

All suggestions welcome. I will edit this text at the end of this discussion to reflect our collective thoughts and then link to it from the subreddit description. Please upvote this post if you think it's a good idea so we can keep it visible to others to share their thoughts.

Rutherford was questioned :

Rutherford, 'You are responsible for Einstein's fame'. And more seriously, he continued:
&gt; The war had just ended: and the complacency of the Victorian and the Edwardian times had been shattered. The people felt that all their values and all their ideals had lost their bearings. Now, prepared for already during the war, by British astronomers. Astronomy had always appealed to public imagination; and an astronomical discovery transcending worldly strife, struck a responsive chord. The meeting of the Royal Society, at which the results of the British expeditions were reported, was headlined in all the
British papers; and the typhoon of publicity crossed the Atlantic. From that point on

Chandrasekhar goes on to illustrate how precarious Einstein's fame had been :

&gt; Suppose the war had not come and [Finlay-Freundlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Finlay-Freundlich) had been able to observe the 1914 eclipse and had found a deflection of 1.7 seconds of arc at a time when Einstein was predicting a deflection of only 0.83 seconds of arc. Imagine how tame Einstein's 1915 calculation of 1.7 seconds of arc would have seemed.... He would have been belatedly changing the value after the event

On the Philosophy sub-reddit a few days ago, I would be happy to put them up in the results. Below I have highlighted only the results where there is a significant difference in response between the three groups.

1. [A priori knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori). PoSs (55%) believe in a priori knowledge significantly less than PoMs (69%) and PGs (71%) do. EDIT: Philosophers of Biology : 45%.

2. Abstract objects : [nominalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism) v [platonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism). PoSs (26%) were considerably less likely than PGs (39%) to be platonists and far less likely than PoMs (60%). EDIT: Only 13% of Philosophers of Biology are platonists. So this Philosopher of Mathematics and this Philosopher of Biology walk into a bar ....

3. [Aesthetic value: objective or subjective?](http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/freedom4.html). Both PGs (41%) and PoMs (46%) favoured aesthetic value as being objective while only (34%) of PoSs did so.

4. [Epistemic justification: internalism or externalism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalism#Justification). Increasingly favoured externalism from PGs (43%) -&gt; PoSs (49%) -&gt; PoMs (54%).

5. [Free will: compatibilism

5. God: theism or atheism? All predominantly atheist (~74%) but the PoSs had far fewer theists (3%) than the other two groups. PoMs had 20% theists. EDIT: 89% of Philosophers of Biology are atheists. 

6. Knowledge: [empiricism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism) or [rationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism)? Striking difference between PoMs who marginally favoured rationalism (37%) and PoSs who strongly favoured empiricism (56%). EDIT: Philosophers of Biology strongly favoured empiricism (79%). Those guys are seriously earthy.

7. [Laws of nature: Humean or non-Humean?](http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lawofnat.htm#H2) Both PoSs and PoMs (40%) were substantially more Humean than PGs (25%). Edit : Philosophers of Biology (53%)

8. Meta-ethics: [moral realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism) or [moral anti-realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/)? Biggest difference here was between the PoSs who were predominantly moral anti-realists (47%) while only 28% PGs were.

9. EDIT: [Mind: physicalism or non-physicalism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) Pro physicalism: PoSs (74%)

10. [Newcomb's problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_problem). PoMs (43%) favour two boxes more than the PGs (31%) do.

11. [Personal identity: biological view

12. Politics: communitarianism

13. Science: [scientific realism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/) or [scientific anti-realism?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism#Anti-realism_in_Science) The main result here is that PoSs were considerably more willing to accept an alternative to scientific realism (alternatives = 40%) than the other two groups (~25%) EDIT: Interestingly

14. EDIT: [Teletransporter (new matter): survival or death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdxucpPq6Lc)? Huge differences here with the PoMs who overwhelmingly were either of no opinion or believed there were was no fact of the matter (43%) while PGs and PoSs who felt the same only constituted 17%. (Thanks to nebiz and drunkentune for explanations)

15. [Time: A-theory or B-theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-series_and_B-series)? The dominant answer for all groups was ""other"" but the POMs accepted B-theory (40%) significantly more than the PGs (26%).

16. [Zombies](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/): inconceivable

Anyone who has studied any physics knows how important [conservation laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) are. They seem to magically pop out of physicists minds to explain some process of physics. Consider [conservation of linear momentum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation_of_linear_momentum), [conservation of quantum probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation#Quantum_mechanics) for example. These conservation laws often go well beyond the experimental data when they are first conceived and seem to reflect some fundamental [symmetry of physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_physics).

Then in 1915, always have a corresponding conservation law. This is known is **[Noether's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem)**. All these terms are defined precisely in the theorem (which is kind of amazing in itself).

Here is what [Einstein had to say](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Obits2/Noether_Emmy_Einstein.html) about Emmy Noether. How many of us have even heard of her? I and some of my physics-educated friends hadn't. 

I still haven't fully gotten my head around the theorem or its epistemological consequences. The whole concept of conservation laws seem amazing to me. It's like very best physicists can somehow call on these mathematical structures that keep turning up over and over again in varied physical systems to explain and unify observation past and future. (Like where did Einstein pull the ""laws of physics must be invariant in all inertial reference frames"" hypothesis from? Seemed like a major epistemological leap beyond the data to me - no denying it has worked well though).

Check out [some of the applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem#Applications) of the theorem -

* the invariance of physical systems with respect to spatial translation (in other words
* invariance with respect to rotation gives the law of conservation of angular momentum;
* invariance with respect to time translation gives the well-known law of conservation of energy
* In quantum field theory, yields further conservation laws, such as the conservation of electric charge from the invariance with respect to a change in the phase factor of the complex field of the charged particle and the associated gauge of the electric potential and vector potential.

Any current practising physicists or those with extensive related reading care to explain more about the theorem and how much practical use it has been in constructing new theories of physics? What does this suggest about the nature of science? It seems to re-open my own mind (at least somewhat) towards what I thought was a fairly wacky epistemology,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,t3_bfptc

Is our experience of time as lapsing just an illusion?",sixbillionthsheep,78,11,30,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience).*

PREFACE : The idea for this post came from the book [Goedel: A Life of Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Gödel-Logic-John-L-Casti/dp/0738205184) which I can't recommend highly enough. I met one of the authors

---

[Kurt Goedel](http://kgs.logic.at/index.php?id=23) and Albert Einstein [frequently hooked up while at Princeton](http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;q=godel+einstein). At one point

Essentially

&gt; The mere compatibility with the laws of nature of worlds in which there is no distinguished absolute time and in which, throws some light on the meaning of time also in those worlds in which an absolute can be defined. For, if someone asserts that this absolute time is lapsing, he accepts as a consequence that whether or not an objective lapse of time exists (i.e., whether or not a time in the ordinary sense of the word exists) depends on the particular way in which matter and its motion are arranged in the world. This is not a straightforward contradiction; nevertheless, a philosophical view leading to such consequences can hardly be considered as satisfactory. 

Time travel into the past raises obvious difficulties about causality - going back in time to kill your infant self for example. Goedel seemed to believe such absurdities would be overcome by principled impossibilities. He offers an analogy by way of the [uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) :

&gt; But the practical difficulties [in travelling into the past] would hardly seem to be trifling. Moreover

Einstein considered the work an ""important contribution to the general theory of relativity..."" and was apparently very confused by the results but dismissed them as not plausible in our own universe. This is not the end of the story however. Time travel has apparently been shown to be compatible with David Deutsch's [""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality#Time_travel). Goedel's solution probably poses more questions than it answers for the philosopher.

**[This Discover magazine article](http://discovermagazine.com/2002/mar/featgodel)** is a must-read for readable discussion about the Einstein-Goedel relationship and Goedel's time travel work. Another good article [here](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Time.pdf).

The program is particularly notable from a PoS standpoint for the niggling debate-between-the-lines between [Andrei Linde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Linde), Linde's theory appears to be the more robust but Turok believes its broad design gives it too many degrees of freedom to explain phenomenon.

Past experience tells us otherwise. Crime waves, water contamination. riots are constant threats to city order.

One such example of a city under threat of losing control to crime was New York City in the 1980s. The city had a worldwide reputation as a dangerous place to be. One of my earliest memories was watching a TV report about [this incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_blackout_of_1977#Effects). (Check [this doco](http://vodpod.com/watch/2267789-streets-of-new-york-rise-fall-of-crime-in-new-york-since-1970s-76-min-documentary) out too). Yet in the 1990s

---

I recently read both Steven Levitt's [Freakonomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics) and Malcolm Gladwell's [Tipping Point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point) which both provide explanations for the stunning crime decrease. They are presented in such simple and compelling ways - it's easy to be persuaded by both. Problem is - they pretty much have nothing in common as explanations.

Gladwell claims [**broken windows theory**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows) is responsible. Essentially, the theory goes, prosecuting more misdemeanours will stem the flow of harder crime. [**This graph**](http://imgur.com/rD0wo.jpg) is used to illustrate the connection. 

Levitt takes an entirely different approach. He claims the reduction of crime was due to the [**flow-through effects of legalised abortion**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impact_of_Legalized_Abortion_on_Crime) which took unwanted young adults off the streets. (Anyone remember the [Elvis lyrics ""he'll grow to be an angry young man some day""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n3ebuL1cPA)?). Here is a [**compelling table of data**](http://i.imgur.com/FRyDa.jpg) used to demonstrate the connection.

The two competing views were first elaborated in two papers in 2001, two government economists went on to [trash Levitt's theory](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113314261192407815-HLjarwtM95Erz45QPP0pDWul8rc_20061127.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top).

Yet somehow, cities do stay clean, safe, uncongested and healthy. While the complexities and non-linearities will render the academic study of city management pseudo-scientific by any usual measure, a dynamic scientific outlook makes a measurable difference to the quality of our lives.

I think I may be having something of a crisis of ""faith"" in the purpose of some science.  I love science.  I realize that I only get one shot at life
      Recently I was reading some papers on the origin of a type of rock called anorthosite.  Anorthosite is an igneous rock made of essentially only one mineral (plagioclase feldspar) and frequently occurs as a part of gigantic igneous bodies called layered intrusive complexes.  It can also occur as very large bodies (we're talking hundreds to thousands of cubic kilometers) outside of these complexes.  For example, maybe earlier, and we *still don't know.*  When that really sank in, I had to stop reading and sit for a moment.  There is some cryptic process that the earth performed for hundreds of millions of years (the earth can't seem to make anorthosites anymore) that resulted in these unfathomable masses of gorgeous rock that make up mountains.  That, to me, is beautiful.  That is why I'm a scientist.  Without even getting off this planet, without even tackling the startling complexity of life, literally larger than mountains, carrying rocks miles through the woods, just because he wants to know why the Adirondacks are made of a blue rock and not a gray rock.  Why does it matter?  Why don't they use that money to build a homeless shelter or something?
    Maybe anorthosites aren't the best example for this.  They occur in the layered intrusive complexes that are the worlds primary sources of metals such as platinum and palladium, if we know the chemical composition of a magma that formed an igneous body that has no connection to natural resources? That information won't get us to Mars.  It won't make anyone's life better.  It won't change our understanding of how the universe works.  
      Finding the answers to these sorts of scientific questions fascinates me.  I love the science and the process; I love not understanding something and realizing that I can go ahead and try and do something about that.  But sometimes I also wonder if I should.  Why should I take these financial resources that could go to feeding a family and instead use the money to answer a question that no one will care about except some weirdos who like rocks a little too much?
    Maybe the question doesn't apply directly to me

TL;DR Why should we spend money on science that will probably not be of any help or interest to anyone outside of science?

Fundamental to the idea of the Singularity is the concept of 'Seed AI' or 'recursively self-improved AI'.

&gt;Seed AI is a hypothesized type of strong artificial intelligence capable of recursive self-improvement. If the AI was about as good at programming as the people that created it

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_AI

Computers are already better than human intelligence in many ways. Your calculators can calculate quicker than you do, etcetera. 

Humans still beat AI at things like pattern recognition and language. This isn't strange: the computational power of the human brain is only rivaled by the biggest and most expensive supercomputers. But if the exponential progress of computing power progresses like it has done for roughly the last century

It seems likely that we'll figure out how the brain works (and use this to construct human-like AI) roughly around that year. [Vernor Vinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge) expects the Singularity to happen before 2030

Human-like AI means that we can combine the best characteristics of human thinking and computers. You know in which ways you are 'superior' to computers

&gt;**Speed.** Our axons carry signals at 75 meters per second or slower. A machine can pass signals along about **4 million times** more quickly.

&gt;**Computational resources.** The brain’s size and neuron count is restrained by skull size, we can just add more of them.

&gt;**Rationality.** As we explored earlier

&gt;**Introspective access / editability.** We humans have almost no introspective access to our cognitive algorithms

&gt;There is no reason in principle why machines could not surpass our abilities at technology design or general reasoning by a similar margin. **The human level is a minor pit-stop on the way to the highest level of intelligence allowed by physics

So how do we get from paradoxes about English statements to Goedelian incompleteness? Here is a [very rough sketch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox#Formal_analogues) on how the paradox is adapted to prove Goedel's key incompleteness theorem. 

But the ""proof"" I like most is by [Greg Chaitlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin), the proof adapts the word ""definable in X words"" in the Berry Paradox to ""cannot be specified by a computer program using Y bits"". 

Chaitlin himself like other well-known logicians is a bit errr ... ""fruity"". He has got himself into trouble before with his [over-reaching and some have said

**Proof cartoon of the paradoxical nature of The Berry Paradox.**

Positive integers (numbers like 1

* The sum of the first ten primes.

* Two thousand one hundred and thirty seven.

* Ninety cubed plus forty three squared plus seventeen.

* The fifty seventh perfect number minus thirteen.

* The smallest prime larger than five trillion.

These all describe a unique positive integer. Now we know there are a finite number of English words in the dictionary. So there can only be a finite number of English phrases under twelve words. But there are an infinite number of positive integers

Now every non-empty set of positive integers (infinite or finite) must have a least element. Why? Well by [mathematical induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction). Assume there is no least element.  So the number 1 cant be in the set because if it were, or n+1 would be the least element. So by induction, no positive integers are in the set. But we know this is false, so there must be a least element.

So there *is* a positive integer X which is ""the smallest positive integer not definable in under twelve English words"". But wait,,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,True

He explained that the core of this was spinning at about 1,500 revolutions per minute while a beautiful graphic was on screen.  Now, and the information was presented as “absolute” fact.  There was no speculation about the workings of this quasar

What really baked my noodle, all of the information presented isn’t really verifiable from the naked eye, but rather by the application of more science (a la http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=486), which of course is even harder to understand than the original concept.  So, my point here is that there is so much “science” involved with each and every aspect of that explanation that I couldn’t possibly begin to fully understand that.  In a conversation with Someone Who Knows, they would likely punch me in my question for incessantly asking “But what does THAT mean?”

The more I try to grasp the complexity of topics like the size of the universe or the speed of light, is growing exponentially.  (And I don’t mean to suggest that there’s a bunch of giddy space nerds viewing my Quasar up close and for real.  I mean, those same scientific rock stars have the capacity to understand the math, physics, mechanics and whatever else that enables one to assimilate and incorporate that type of information into their lives…and then figure out a way to dumb it down enough so that someone like me can barely understand.).

We are moving towards a future where the “foundational core concepts” of any given subject are going to be so enormous that I cannot fathom how we will have the time to teach those future generations

We are almost at the day when an astro-scientist can come on TV and explain that the scientific community knows, fuck me…how in the world do you know THAT?”.  The science needed to arrive at that conclusion is mind fuzzling and yet it will soon be as matter-of-fact as the science behind the workings of my boring old solar calculator.

I think the other side of this, the more likely that the science becomes doubted or minimized or labeled as magic.  I think we may see this now with some of the creationist arguments…it is quite possible that this is the only thing that makes sense to someone that cannot grasp the science involved with evolution.

My interest in Energy follows.  My understanding of it on a pragmatic level is that energy is the ability to do work.  In this capacity, i.e. - gravity may cause an apple to fall from the tree as the apple has potential energy in it which is translated to kinetic energy once detached from the tree and in the free flow of gravity until it meets a barrier to stop its progress, often of an electromagnetic variety).  

Similarly though, and while I'm open-minded enough to embrace that we may embody these more intangible properties as our senses create the illusion of a tangible reality, (e.g. - the color of a seat comes from what isn't absorbed by the atoms of the seat and what stops us falling through it is founded in the electromagnetic principles), it's still difficult to answer then what is this intangible reality we seem to be existing within.  

Further

Even on the Wiki page for Energy, but one often reviewed and updated by a wide community*), the topic of ""what is energy?"" is stated as being ""difficult to answer in a simple, intuitive way.""  It then goes further to cite others such as Richard Feynman supporting this point.  

If Energy is (*possibly just*) a resource available to cause change over time, or waves.  Universal fields or multidimensional branes.  What then is the fundamental of what Energy is?  

**TL;DR** - What is Energy tangibly? What is a quanta of energy by itself?

[Strict finitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism). That's the answer. Believe that there is a largest finite integer. You don't even have to specify that number. Just say something like ""Let H be the largest integer ever representable by any computer in the next [googol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol) years. I believe that there is no greater integer than H^(H^(H^(H^(H^(H^(H^H))))))"". Append this belief (carefully) to your rules of arithmetic. Congratulations
You can now stop having nightmares about zombie Austrian logicians undermining the confidence in your decisions. It's as simple as that. Ever wondered why computer manufacturers don't offer Godelian incompleteness virus detection? Your computer is a strict finitist. As such

Finitism in general is a mathematically anti-realist position - rejecting the independent existence of mathematical objects and believing they are nothing more than human constructions. Wittgenstein was certainly a mathematical anti-realist and [some say, although using concepts of infinity sometimes makes the math easier.

I was re-reading Nassim Taleb's book [""The Black Swan""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book\)) when I came across this passage describing where Islamic and Christian attitudes towards science diverged in the 12th Century :

*The eleventh-century Arabic-language skeptic Al-Ghazali, and they managed to reconcile it with Islam through rational argument.*

*Algazel's attack on ""scientific"" knowledge started a debate with Averroës, but sadly, won by both. In its aftermath, many Arab religious thinkers integrated and exaggerated Algazel's skepticism of the scientific method, preferring to leave causal considerations to God (in fact it was a stretch of his idea). The West embraced Averroës's rationalism, built upon Aristotle's, which survived through Aquinas and the Jewish philosophers who called themselves Averroan for a long time. Many thinkers blame the Arabs' later abandonment of scientific method on Algazel's huge influence. He ended up fueling Sufi mysticism, severing all connections with earthly matters.*

[Averroes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes) turns out to be a thinker of immense impact in astronomy, law, medicine, logic, politics, psychology and more.  His school of philosophy, [Averroism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroism) became the dominant school of thought in Western Europe right up until the 16th Century. 

Among [his numerous contributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes#Contributions) to knowledge was his description of force and inertia which Galileo himself rejected but was ultimately adopted by Newton. Some consider him the first existentialist philosopher. [In one work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes#Significance)

The debate between Averroes and [Algazel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali) was captured in two books. Algazel's attack on philosophy [""The Incoherence of the Philosophers""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers) can be read in full [here](http://www.ghazali.org/works/taf-eng.pdf). Averroes reply is called [""The Incoherence of the Incoherence""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence) and is available in full [here](http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ir/tt/index.html).

The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis; but the external conditions, which are set for him by the facts of experience, do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist: he appears as realist insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of the acts of perception; as idealist insofar as he looks upon the concepts and theories as free inventions of the human spirit (not logically derivable from what is empirically given); as positivist insofar as he considers his concepts and theories justified only to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences. He may even appear as Platonist or Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.""

The response really took us by surprise. Had anticipated more like 50 responses. I chose text box free-form answer form thinking it would be easy to collate the results manually. User Pas__ suggested to crowdsource the analysis using an implementation strategy [described here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/dgrw6/please_participate_in_our_first_ever/c1070qk).

What this would mean is that we would make public the entire spreadsheet of answers minus the answers to three questions - the where do you live question, and to protect remote chance of identification. (**EDIT: We have replaced all locality information by country only. We have removed all University and location details. We would like to keep the personal philosophy answers in, as well as the suggestions answers. But we will remove the question about profession/jobs.** They have been scanned for identifying information.) There would be no other identifying information such as username and IP address.

How do people feel about this? It would possibly give us a chance to see some analysis and results from different perspectives

Soft mindedness has often invaded the ranks of religion. This is why religion has sometimes rejected new truth with a dogmatic passion. Through edicts and bulls, and reason is often looked upon as the exercise of a corrupt faculty. Softminded persons have revised the Beatitudes to read, ""Blessed are the pure in ignorance: for they shall see God.""

All of this has lead to the widespread belief that there is a conflict between science and religion. But this is not true. There may be a conflict between softminded religionists and toughminded scientists

I saw the new [Sherlock Holmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_\(2009_film\)) movie last night and thought the whole Holmes business was interesting as historical scientific fiction. Chuckled at a few gems of philosophy-of-science wisdom that Holmes educates Watson with. His strict adherence to the facts

[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle), perhaps the extent of his rationality is defined : *""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbably, must be the truth""*.  In [The Boscombe Valley Mystery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boscombe_Valley_Mystery), he sounds very Kuhnian stating: *""Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing ... It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, he states *""We approached the case ... with an absolute blank mind, both before and after.""*

**[The author of this paper](http://www.ifets.info/journals/10_1/16.pdf)** believes that Holmes uses a style of reasoning known as [abductive reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning). The canonical example of abductive reasoning is as follows:

&gt; Rule: All the beans from this bag are white.

&gt; Result: These beans are white.

&gt; Case: Therefore

While the inference is of course not logically valid
Kepler had about the longitudes and latitudes of Mars’ revolutions around the sun suggested a finite number of
geometrical curves from which to choose. Kepler’s hypothesis was that the orbit is elliptical
corroborated against the available evidence. More on abduction [here](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html).

**It's worth asking the questions - in what circumstances is abduction a legitimate form of reasoning? Why does deriving hypotheses from consequents often prove so pragmatically useful despite the logical fallacy of [deducing the antecedent from the consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)?**



As Holmes once said :

*To let the brain work without sufficient material is like racing an engine. It racks itself to pieces.*

-----

Incidentally I also discovered a book called *[Fact and feeling: Baconian science and the nineteenth-Century literary](http://www.amazon.com/Fact-Feeling-19Th-Century-Imagination-Literature/dp/0299143503)* pretty much confirms that Sherlock Holmes was meant to be the epitome of the Baconian scientist. **[This passage at pages 215-216 is a must read for Holmes fans](http://books.google.com/books?id=hFn1Zx_desIC&amp;lpg=PP13&amp;ots=MCZuIGWL4P&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false)**. This book's basic theme is that several 19th Century literary figures paved the way in the public mind for scientific supremacy by bringing together reason and imagination. Will have more on the Baconian method in a followup post.

The standout work is [Lawrence Principe](http://krieger.jhu.edu/singleton/faculty-directory/principe.html)'s ""Alchemy Restored"" which is well worth the read.  The concluding paragraph is

&gt; Alchemy’s exclusion illustrates strategic redefinitions of science, or programmatic philosophies will allow. It collects elements from unexpected sources and synthesizes them in unexpected and unpredictable ways. It is never a mechanical or impersonal process—nor would we want it to be. While the laws of nature exist independently of us, the ways we choose to conceive of them, to explore or not to explore them, to describe or not to describe them—that is to say, science—is a very human affair, filled with all the complexities and simplicities, pettiness and
nobility that customarily attend human activity. And

Hello all, I apologize and hope to be directed to that discussion.

The topic at hand is the definition, say interpersonal communication, spirituality, and oh hell home economics, criticized for their lack of objective verifiability and basically treated as willy nilly opinions or outright hogwash despite their utility to me individually and others I know.

The foundation of science being in “objective verifiability” to me is in the extreme untenable or at least needing clarification and perhaps a name change. To me objectivity cannot exist, even if that experience is the pursuit of scientific knowledge, and that experience is filtered through all of their past experiences, opinions, beliefs and all the other various elements that make up a human's uniqueness.

Now in science we verify each others claims by following the same procedure as others have and see if we find the same results. I don't deny verification

Perhaps I can use an example to illustrate my dilemma. I can lift up an object and let go of it, but more accurately a consensus among those that have thought about it and tested it. Yet we still take that step and universalize and “objectify” what to me is really just a consensus among similar subjective experiences. 

Where it gets really tricky is when we apply science to technology. Technology works because science is valid

To me, being and spirituality.

So

Since we deal with the intersection of philosophy and science

1.  Everybody knows that the only rational form of inquiry is science.
2.  Science requires empirical reasoning from data.
3.  (Philosophy/You/The humanities/etc.) are not doing that
4.  What you are doing is not rational.
    
    Alternative conclusions include: What you are doing has no meaning; what you are doing isn't worthwhile; you are a moron and deserve to die in a fire; &amp;c.

I have a modest proposal for the PoS subreddit community: let's come up with a set of links to things like [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2011/02/04/133363055/a-little-philosophy-is-a-dangerous-thing) and [this](http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/12/30/attacks-on-philosophy-by-scientists/) where people have done their dead level best to make the case for the existence of an independent method of philosophical or meta-scientific inquiry.

In short, or something, and be able to say ""Here.  If you aren't convinced by *any* of these arguments, then I just don't know what to tell you, enough said.""  I'd even be happy to host such a link collection on my professional website.

**I. Luria's work on literacy**

This post is about the work of the Russian psychologist A. R. Luria on preliterate Uzbek communities and some radical theories about epistemology.

&gt;...once one has acquired descriptive language, and thus transcend. Self-transcendence, a familiar characteristic of human life, is attained largely by the reflective criticism and examination of the theories that hold the self together; by the destruction of some of those theories; and by the creation of new theories in their place. (p.63)

Luria noted in *[The Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations](http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQX2WmMJUMcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a.r.+luria&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ncBdTIHSJoGClAfX56yZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)* that literacy *changed the structure of the brain* in as much a revolutionary way as the change between pre-linguistic and linguistic communities.

Luria found that, *learning to read*), individuals were (1) concrete in their judgments, (2) magical in their thinking (asserted a mind was behind some course of events), and (3) use-based.

*After* only a year of training in literacy, (2') non-magical (asserted that a mind did not necessarily direct an event), and (3') category-based. There were other changes, some just as drastic, but these three, along with one more change, are what interest me the most. 

**II. Hear me out ...**

I should explain. Luria noted that when providing deductive arguments tailored to a cultural setting, and could provide no conclusions. 

Formal logic is a relatively modern invention, ""Up North where there is snow, the bears are white. A city up North always has snow. What color are the bears"" A typical response was: “You find what color bears are by looking at him. Whoever heard of reasoning out of practical life the color of a polar bear? Besides, how am I sure that you know for sure that all bears are white in a snowy country?” This went on and on to such lengths that reading Luria's work, while quite interesting in their own right, sounds a bit repetitious, for after eight or nine examples of individuals repeatedly refusing to make the cognitive leap when dealing with places they have not directly experienced

These preliterate people treated the phenomenal state acquired through the use of sight, and touch, to be the only available option.

**III. Abstraction**

This concreteness extended to such things as sorting objects: the illiterate subjects tested by Luria refused to deal in abstractions. When shown drawings of four items, the illiterate subjects thought of the groups not in categorical terms, but in practical terms. For instance, when a peasant was shown a log, hatchet, saw and hammer, he said, I'd throw out the hatchet. It doesn't do as good a job as a saw."" This extended to sorting and providing names to colors and abstract shapes.

For instance, and their use of abstract colors were limited. Something was up.

Thus, new logical categories, and the ability to understand a deductive, rather than evidentiary, argument. The logic of preliterate culture is additive rather than causal; situational and concrete rather than abstract. If the method of grouping changes from practical to logical terms with literacy, the changes that take place in the brain through literacy sounds like an absolute requirement for the development of science. 

The objectification of our ideas is a recent invention that occurred at several points throughout history, in much the same way that one can reflect on and criticize the ideas of others, an individual's previously-held ideas. In a sense, the literate individual can make their private language or inner-monologue *public*, even if it is only available to that same individual at a later time. Literacy makes the world of ideas, previously only having an indirect influence on our emotional or cognitive states, have a *direct* influence on our cognitive states by way of *understanding* the relationship between symbols -- scratchings on parchment or clay tablets -- and what is symbolized.

**IV. Symbols**

This is a gradual transformation, but the first symbols used were pictorial representations of objects.

&gt; ...theoretical language provides man with an opportunity that permits him to dissociate from, not identified with himself, which may then be examined. This process of examining such objects is one of renderings them strange, and of passing beyond a merely subjective relationship with them. This approach allows us to ""have done with"" some subjective states, to pass beyond them, to become free of them, to transcend them. (p.64)

Literacy begins a cascading series of events: we share 95% of our genetic material with chimpanzees, which enabled language, which birthed a whole new level of competition between individuals, that of oratory, that led to sexual selection... or something like that.

**V. One more thing...**

Oh, etc. However, these individuals were uninterested in asking these questions, saying things like 'We were just discussing crops. Could you tell me how to make our crops grow better?' *Literate* individuals were overflowing with questions about all manner of things: places, people, things, countries, etc. A world was opened up to them through the written word and they wanted to know *more*.

Some commenters have found Luria's findings dubious. I've pulled up several recent studies on literacy changing the structure of thought. The last article is, since it refers to a little-known study that replicated most of the findings of Luria's experiment in an African community.

([Previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/aig46/today_i_learned_that_the_person_who_introduced/)).

This was an extraordinary period of time and place in history when [Muslims, the Christians expelled the Muslims, converted [Averroes' mosque to a church](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rE2TxJiFqE), and a little while later instigated the Spanish Inquisition to weed out infidels. The only tribute in Cordoba to Averroes, a statue [(crap video I made here)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv7nj7PF95M) was actually erected by Jews and is based in the Jewish quarter of Cordoba. Ultimately, Averroes was far more influential among Christians and Jews than he was with Muslims. Even to this day, his works are [banned in Syria](http://www.vivagranada.com/greatmoors/index.htm). 

I don't think Averroes was an atheist, and why he was banished for a time during his lifetime. He believed that the truth could be reached via philosophical reflection (independently of revelation). This was not an uncommon view by the Islamic elite and powerful at that time. For him though,
the Qur'an was like a Discovery Channel documentary - a dumbed down, our imaginations and our individual selves also die but our intellect lives on as part of the global collective intellect (one scholar in the **BBC podcast below** described this concept as being like ""the internet"").

Historically

We can only wonder at what stage science (and humanity) would be now if civilisation had chosen Averroes' science/philosophy path to truth back then.

A lesson from his passion for Mayan astronomy.,sixbillionthsheep,45,3,10,"Richard Feynman during his time in Mexico became very interested in Mayan hieroglyphics and astronomy. He delivered a lecture at Caltech about it.  This excerpt of the lecture is from the biography of Feynman called [Genius](http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044) by James Gleick. It seems to show Feynman wrestling with his operationalist view of science.

---

Consider a Mayan astronomer, which when followed produced accurate results. Yet it seemed to lack a kind of understanding. ""They counted a certain number and subtracted some numbers, and so on,"" he said. ""There was no discussion of what the moon was. There was no discussion even of the idea that it went around.""

Now a ""young man"" approaches the astronomer with a new idea. What if there are balls of rock out there, half-formed physical intuitions.)

&gt; ""Yes."" says the astronomer, ""Well, we can calculate eclipses more accurately than you can with your model, so you must not pay any attention to your idea because obviously the mathematical scheme is better.""

Contrast this with this  **[must-watch video of an earlier lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TI1M3abAM8)** where Feynman displays his earlier thinking on the Mayans.

In one volume,  Bernstein speculated about the existence of gravity waves.  Like Einstein, Bernstein was also eager to tie together all of nature's forces. The philosophy of science underlying Bernstein's writings seemed to mirror Einstein's later scientific realism and trust in the power of rational thought over experiment. For example, Bernstein wrote of the discovery of Uranus: *""Praised be this science! Praised be the men who do it! And praised be the human mind, which sees more sharply than does the human eye.""*

The [World Science Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Science_Festival) is an annual event held in New York City which began in 2008. The event consists mostly of on-stage discussions and presentations by prominent scientists

This discussion concerns ultimate unified explanations of physics. It's a little over an hour long. There is a large smattering of [string theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) (with one of the founders participating). The interesting philosophical discussion really gets going in Part 5. If you don't have the time for all parts

The Youtube description of the discussion follows :

*Albert Einstein spent his last thirty years unsuccessfully searching for a 'unified theory' - a single master principle to describe everything in the universe

*Renowned physicists [Leonard Susskind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind)
 [Janna Levin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janna_Levin)
 [Jim Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gates)
 and prominent historian [Peter Galison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Galison) discussed what's been achieved and tackled pivotal questions. Would a unified theory reveal why there is a universe at all? Would it tell us why mathematics is adept at unraveling nature's mysteries? Might it imply we are one universe of many

Recently I had a Internet Argument. At one point, but I think I ought to explain my feelings about them through use of a thought-experiment.

**I. The thought-experiment**

You are sitting next to a dogmatist on the train. After they get you with their religious hook (""Hey, *And how do you know that your holy book is right?* They respond by using the existence of their deity to justify the truth of their holy book. Their argument is unassailable!

Furthermore, for *who* granted you the ability to reason? Their deity, that's who! Get down on your knees and *submit!*

**II. Dogmatist tactics**

If you step back and think for a moment

In response, or one passage is allegorical while the other passage is literal, etc. If the dogmatist has the will and intelligence, it's easy for them to smooth over any bumps in the wallpaper.

Or

Sometimes

Or

The dogmatist might unintentionally or intentionally misrepresent the criticisms

They might ask you to provide some reason for your criticism

Of course

**III. A possible reason behind dogmatist tactics**

The dogmatist makes these maneuvers, usually by augmenting or striking out the theories on the periphery: the theories that are easily changed while still not threatening the core theory. Like an immunization shot, these surreptitious changes prevent infection from viruses that would weaken the core.

During the Cold War ""buffer zones"" prevented any full-frontal assault on either the US or the USSR. Yet, economics, and values. This tells us that *anyone* can use this argument to protect *any* core theory. Rather than dealing with the *content* of the core, this whole time you and the dogmatist are fighting over the ""buffer zones"" without ever getting a chance to address the core.

**IV. Methodological choices**

If the content of the core theory is irrelevant to its irrefutability

The dogmatist makes some very specific methodological choices. For instance, the whole web is like a satellite that drifts out of orbit. It can't be reached by any empirical test. If it moves far enough, it becomes its own hermeneutic tradition, unwilling to listen to *any sort of criticism*.

A problem with this tactic

What does this behavior say about the relationship between the two people arguing (talking past one another) on the train? The dogmatist with the perfect argument thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong: they are like the parent lecturing children that just don't know any better. Since you are *not* a child

**V. Treating people as equals**

I think this is a way to sabotage a conversation, why is Satan thrown out of Heaven? Perhaps it is because he dared to treat God as an equal? Was it because he dared question God's plan? This example matters only in the sense that most dogmas state that criticism in-itself to be an act of heresy or treason. This says a great deal about Western culture with its affinity to violence.

Take the recent case of WikiLeaks and Cablegate (Why not? Everyone else is having a go!): releasing the documents is treason; WikiLinks questions the rightful authority of the State to go about its business; Julian Assange ought to be shot on sight; *so what* if the state has behaved unethically - or illegally - when the bogeyman is out *there*, governments around the world tell us to [pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA)

I think that there are two options available: as Assange has said in the recent *[Time](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,00.html#ixzz17Fryw1HD)* interview,

&gt;""If their behavior is revealed to the public, and as a result, of course, cease to be as efficient as they were. To me, that is a very good outcome, because organizations can either be efficient, open and honest, conspiratorial and inefficient.""

**VI. Objection!**

There still is an objection (of sorts): I object on the grounds that the individual is making the theory unassailable. They block the assault by building ever more concentric walls around the city. Nothing can get in, this often leads to violence or subjugation. It becomes a matter of controlling others.

**VII. Why should anyone argue with someone that is unwilling to change?**

I think that by pointing out their stance they might realize their mistake in behavior and subsequently correct it. Oftentimes

If someone isn't able to change, been a waste; however, someone that is not dogmatic might learn new things, like where to donate their money in the future, or what policies to vote for, or who can be trusted. For instance, I've learned not to allow myself to get into arguments on trains

If the dogmatist corrects their behavior, I think the willingness to listen to others is far more conducive to error-correction than sticking to our guns.

With this and cost in mind, the author seems well-read in fields outside of philosophy of science and has refrained from slandering anyone so far, rather building upon the works of even those he disagrees with. I'll be finishing _Infinite Jest_ before I begin on it in earnest, but that should happen within the next day or two.

I'm curious, as well as what they think of Giere or his book. Most of the philosophy that I've read has been of mind or language, so fairly analytic stuff and I have no problem reading and understanding works of analytic philosophy. In general I'm more interested in epistemology and ontology than methodology when it comes to phil. of sci. (that is, the more abstract stuff).

The water boiled after a few hours and continued to boil indefinitely. The experiment cast doubt on the theory that heat was a substance, and Count Rumford argued that heat was in fact, motion. Caloric theorists, unconstrained by a mathematical representation of their theory kind of absorbed the result into their own theory.

Description:

The Day the Universe Changed is a ten-part documentary television series presented by science historian James Burke. The series tells a series of stories of how specific scientific and technological advances have shaped the Western way of life. The series posits that when one's view of the universe changes, you have essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present. 

Episode 1: The Way We Are: It Started with the Greeks. 

Episode 2: In the Light of the Above: Medieval Conflict - Faith &amp; Reason. 

Episode 3: Point of View: Scientific Imagination in the Renaissance. 

Episode 4: A Matter of Fact: Printing Transforms Knowledge. 

Episode 5: Infinitely Reasonable: Science Revises the Heavens. 

Episode 6: Credit Where It's Due: The Factory &amp; Marketplace Revolution. 

Episode 7: What the Doctor Ordered: Social Impacts of New Medical Knowledge.

I was impressed when I came across this and wanted to share. In so far as you choose to trust my assessment of such matters

**The link [is here at a blog](http://rationalargumentator.com/issue195/godel.html) called the Rational Argumentator.**  The author appears to be a [mathematically trained independent scholar](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/apstolyarov.htm) now working as an actuary and philosophizing in his spare time.  

(For an even more readable

**TL;DR**  : A few memorable quotes from the article that might help put Godel in perspective for some people :

1. *The concepts of consistency and completeness are purely syntactical concepts


2. *Gödel's incompleteness theorems do not pertain to systems which are not framed in the language of mathematics – such as political, economic, biological, and literary systems and bodies of thought. Virtually every such system is incomplete in the formal mathematical sense*


3. *Theories to which Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem applies cannot be described via a finite body of axioms*


4. *Gödel’s proof of the existence of true but unprovable statements can be applied not only to Peano arithmetic itself but to any system which gives one the capacity to assign Gödel numbers to statements. Such a system must be “expressive enough to define the set of natural numbers or develop basic properties of the natural numbers


5. *Gödel himself did not initially view his incompleteness theorems as defeating any of Hilbert’s program.... However,” eventually led Gödel to change his mind.*

6. *If von Neumann was right, “much work has gone into extended (or relativized) forms of Hilbert’s program using constructive though non-finitistic means for consistency proofs.*


7. *Gödel’s second theorem showed that the consistency of a system cannot be proved within that system. It is a common mistake


8. *In 1936,”with quantifier-free transfinite induction, “an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets,”up to the ordinal ε0.*  My note: Primitive recursive arithmetic is any many respects *weaker* than Peano arithmetic.


9. *Gödel’s last published paper in the journal Dialectica gave another proof of the consistency of the arithmetical axioms in 1958*


10. *Gödel’s theorems do not pertain to the issue of the existence of an objective reality*


11. *Gödel… saw his incompleteness theorems not as demonstrating the inadequacy of the axiomatic method but as showing that the derivation of theorems cannot be completely mechanized. He believed they justified the role of intuition in mathematical research.*


12. *By showing some fundamental limitations to how the consistency of mathematical systems can be proved,False,,t5_2r7mh,True,,,t3_ac5om

The use of placebos has raised ethical questions about the use of deception in placebo therapy. Prescribing a placebo intervention introduces issues of patient trust in the clinician and violates informed consent. Despite the known clinical effectiveness of placebo therapy

A [small study published this week]( http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0015591) has opened the door to the potential widespread use of placebo therapy without such ethical concern. In the study, patients taking the placebo had greater reduction in symptoms than has been seen in trials where IBS patients are treated with active medications.

The study highlights the power of the psychological influence on disease. It demonstrates that the psychology of disease and its treatment goes beyond the power of belief, the impact on healthcare could be large – medications, alternative therapies and over-the-counter preparations that have been shown to have no effect above a placebo but are often still prescribed precisely “for the placebo effect” could become obsolete, and replaced with inert sugar/water pills (homeopathic preparations?) without ethical concerns or even without significant contact with formal mainstream or alternative healthcare.",,False,,False,t3_eqct5

The Duhem-Quine thesis is often referred to as the Duhem-Quine *problem*, so to speak, is that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. In particular, the Duhem-Quine thesis is often held up as a refutation of Karl Popper's criterion of falsifiability, and it's this claim I wish to address here.

Normally, just as truth is transmitted from premises to conclusion in a valid argument, so falsity is retransmitted from conclusion to premises, i.e. if the conclusion is false, then at least one of the premises must be false.

Where 'H' is a scientific hypothesis and 'E' is some evidence,

    H ⊨ E

However, e.g. initial conditions. We'll label these auxiliary hypotheses 'A^1' to 'A^n'.

    H &amp; (A^1 &amp; ... A^n) ⊨ E

Now we have a rather explicit representation of the Duhem-Quine problem: 'not-E' no longer entails 'not-H'. In this case, and there are multiple logically permissible moves to restore consistency. Perhaps 'H' is just false, or maybe 'H' is true and 'A^7' is the problem; maybe they're all false.

However, Popper stressed that all observation is theory-laden. He argued that even a simple statement like 'there is a cup of water here on the table' is theoretically-loaded. Things like tables, water, and cups are defined by their general behaviour; even the idea of something being *here* involves rather complex assumptions about space and time. For Popper, then, there was nothing infallible or epistemologically foundational about observation; rather, reports of observation are highly conjectural attempts to capture discrete facts.

My claim, rather than lumping the auxiliary hypotheses with our premises, we should instead place them in the conclusion, because it's the auxiliary hypotheses that actually impregnate our observations with the theory necessary to make them possible at all. To preserve the validity of the argument, then, we append the auxiliary hypotheses to 'E' as the antecedent of a material implication.

    H ⊨ (A^1 &amp; ... A^n) → E

In this case, for example, 'there is a cup of water here on the table', can be false in many different ways, but each way that it might be false changes the meaning of the observation in some way.

For example, in this new formulation of the argument, assuming the auxiliary hypotheses are false is tantamount to claiming the observation itself is false, because it's the auxiliary hypotheses that are doing the theoretical-ladening--they are what make the observation possible in the first place.

So constructed, of course, a logically permissible move, but it isolates disagreement in the theoretical interpretation of an observation.",,False,,1358143389.0,t3_16ijox

**0. Why the fuck?**

It's important. That's why. Note: I know just as much as you about the classic tragedies

**I.**

In Euripides' *Electra*, but Euripides’s Electra is unwilling to make such a leap of faith, methodically rejecting the *very same arguments* given by Aeschylus’s Electra when placed in the old man's mouth. She rejects the possibility of her brother would return in secret, for she assumes that he would return openly (524-26) and then she goes on (527-29) to note the inherent differences between the lock of hair from a woman and a man and the irrelevance of foot-size in determining relatives. To finish the syllogism, she notes that many people who are unrelated also have similar hair. *This is the new faith in the capabilities of reason.*

**II.**

Euripides paints a world full of confusion and error, but it is a faith in the nobility of Orestus, the nobility of humankind. This is the faith of modern science, where reason is taken to have triumphed over superstition, and yet it claims far more epistemic warrant than it deserves. It *is* a type of faith. All the evidence is rejected (and rightly so!) as demonstrating nothing, and yet Orestes is present, and has been speaking with his sister for some time. 

Electra is wrong *just as she is making the most reasonable assessment of the evidence at hand*. And yet her earlier incarnation makes the correct inferences for all the wrong reasons (credulity). Euripides mocks the very *pretensions* of human reasoning, too, has a deep faith in rationality, and by extension, that evidence and truth are often worlds apart: Electra is right in her reasoning, *and yet she is wrong*.

No one is a hero; no one is noble; there is no happy ending; everyone

However, that the Church acted both more rationally and in a more scientifically disciplined manner than Galileo did in the historical context, contrary to popular scientistic mythology. I would go even further to say that the Pope at the time of Galileo (a former close friend of his before he became Pope) most likely even accepted Galileo's heliocentrism but circumstance ([ongoing war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War)), the availability of an empirically adequate alternative ([Tycho's Brahe's model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system)) and Galileo's obnoxiousness (depicting him as a [simpleton in the Dialogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems), defying Church order to keep an open mind) prevented him from tolerating the view publicly.

I think Keeping an Open Mind is pernicious at best:

(1) If we were to *attempt* to remove our biases, rather than at the *idea*.

(2) Humans always view new ideas in relation to their background knowledge. No one can remove all of their 'biases' without wiping the mind. We wouldn't follow the habit to stay clear of three-card Monty or dark alleys late at night. We would have to abandon the preference for truth over falsity. These are also 'biases'

(3) Credulity would replace criticism.

Credulous individuals, and once they are within the castle, they never *confront* these new ideas to see if they're carrying contraband. I think this is the insidious problem of Keeping an Open Mind: it's best when dealing with the imaginative creation of possible situations (there might be a bear in the back of the cave!), but it would be mistaken to *act* on these imaginative creations without critically evaluating them on their merits (if there might be a bear in the back of the cave, there *must* be a bear in the back of the cave!). 

In short

**tl;dr**: The expression to 'keep an open mind' is used today to preemptively counter possible criticisms of an idea.

[Game theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/) has had some [limited success as a descriptive theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Application_and_challenges) in economics, a state of the game where no player can improve his/her outcome by changing his/her strategy without causing an opportunity for a better outcome for other players by changing strategy. (Yes Nash was that guy that the movie [A Beautiful Mind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/) was based on).

Games may have multiple Nash equilibria and it is generally agreed by theorists that the best outcome for all players, equilibria of games might not be achieved, they will always tend toward an equilibrium point as games are repeated.  Conditions for this to occur include the requirement that all players are ""rational"" and that all players have perfect information about payoffs and possible moves. 

**This assumption/definition of rationality is where the trouble for game theory begins.**

One of the problems with these assumptions lies in human psychology. Consider what is known as the [ultimatum game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game) between two players. A fixed amount of money is to be shared among two players. One player is selected to make an offer about how much he will keep and how much he will give to the other player. The other player then has the option to accept or reject the offer. If he rejects the offer, it is ""Nash-optimal"" for the second player to accept any non-zero amount the other player offers. However this is [not what happens in practice](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=286428). The average offer is 40% of the total and 16% of all offers are rejected. 

**But disagreement with experiment is only the start of the problems for the Nash equilibrium concept**. 

Consider the game called the **[traveller's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler's_dilemma)**. A referee asks two players to write down any dollar integer between 2 and 100 without conferring with each other. If both write the same number the referee will pay each of them that amount. But if they write different numbers, Player 1 will get $48 and Player 2 will get $44. (For a more extensive and informal discussion of the game and its consequences see [this blog post](http://blog.adamnash.com/2007/11/13/the-travelers-dilemma-irrational-choices-altriuism-or-implicit-collusion/). To try a simulation of the game yourself [go here](http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/tddemo.htm)).

There is one unique Nash equilibrium for this game - both players write down $2. Yet this seems to defy all common sense. They could have both offered much larger numbers and both have been much better off. In fact this is **[what happens in live experiments](http://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5in3UhbNXiJNmM5MTg1NWEtMjc2Ny00NDRjLTk2NDAtNjNmYmIyODg3MWZk&amp;hl=en)**. According to the theorists

[Douglas Hofstadter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) (author of *[Godel,_Escher,_Bach)*) proposed a new definition of rationality he called [superrationality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) whereby each player knows not only that his behavior is rational, but that the behavior of all players is rational, and all players know that all players are rational, and all players know that all players know that all players are rational, and so on. Hofstadter reasons based on this assumption, agree to collude and keep silent in the [Prisoner's Dilemma](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/) game (in which the unique Nash equilibrium suggests that both players should confess).

Whenever it’s been possible to make definite progress on ancient philosophical problems, with luck, one solves Q′.

Of course, Q′′′, and so on — which capture aspects of Q that Q′ left untouched. But from my perspective, this process of “breaking oﬀ” answerable parts of unanswerable riddles, then trying to answer those parts, is the closest thing to philosophical progress that there is.

Successful examples of this breaking-oﬀ process fill intellectual history. The use of calculus to treat infinite series, set theory and first-order logic, special relativity, Gödel’s theorem, game theory, information theory, computability and complexity theory, the theory of common knowledge, probability and information and life and mind.

 ...The claim is not that the new question, rather, is that the new question is a worthy candidate for what we should have asked or meant to have asked, if our goal was to learn something new rather than endlessly debating definitions. [Luke adds: I'm reminded of Dennett's quip that ""Philosophy... is what you have to do until you figure out what questions you should have been asking in the first place.""] In math and science, the process of revising one’s original question is often the core of a research project, with the actual answering of the revised question being the relatively easy part!

A good replacement question Q′ should satisfy two properties:

 (a) Q′ should capture some aspect of the original question Q — so that an answer to Q′ would be hard to ignore in any subsequent discussion of Q.

 (b) Q′ should be precise enough that one can see what it would mean to make progress on Q′: what experiments one would need to do

Conversely, if digital computers were proved unable to win the imitation game, then it’s hard to see what more science could say in support of machine intelligence not being possible.

I was out smoking a cigarette when I decided to start writing on the connection between ethics and epistemology and settled on an exposition of Popper and Jarvie's critical approach to ethics.

**I.**

Some people think that there are no grounds on which to judge different cultures. The cultural practice of ['honor' killing](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-crimewave-that-shames-the-world-2072201.html) is as equally justified as cultural practices that ensure freedom of speech

In a (qualified) sense

**II.**

This same claim is directed towards different cultural theories of knowledge (Feyerabend, reading the entrails of goats is any better than the Western process of scientific discovery?

Again

**III.**

A justificationist is then in a bind: she has no way to justify the preference of some cultures over overs. However, both ethically and epistemically, without resorting to any sort of justification for this preference.

Instead of asserting that there exists externally to culture some kind of ephemeral justification for ethics or epistemology

**IV.**

Take the next step: Which kinds of results do I want? I make a choice to prefer freedom over slavery

I make the meta-theoretical *choice* to prefer what Popper calls 'Open' societies or cultures over 'Closed' societies or cultures. This applies equally to ethics *and* epistemology. I choose to prefer nonviolence; I choose to prefer science. *Why do I choose them?* Initially

If I don't know if I'm right in my proposals for ethical action or conjectures, it is not productive to squash all competing ideas. *If* I want to fix my mistakes, I want to hear productive criticism from all different sorts of viewpoints. Furthermore, if I stone a woman to death because her actions go against my ideas of what is right, my idea of what is right could could be in error. *If* I am mistaken, I do not want blood on my hands.

Thus, acting so as to harm another person I think deserves harm may in fact be an *unethical* action.

Alan Guth delivered the 2009 Isaac Newton Lecture for the Institute of Physics (Great Britain) **which you can watch in full [here](http://www.iop.org/news/archive/november/page_42348.html)**. In it he attempted to explain how the Universe formed and became what it is now using all known tools and theories available to him. In this model, but the concept of a grand design is *almost* sounding more plausible to me by now). Guth himself is clearly atheist or agnostic stating in his post talk interview (available [here](http://www.iop.org/resources/videos/people-and-events/page_42749.html)) :
&gt; I've never found it useful to believe in an omniscient and omnipotent God who controls things.

Mr Descartes, consider - what is the chance that all the theoretical tools to build the perfect explanation of the Universe all just happen to be lying around your theory tool shed simultaneously as of 1647 or 2009? Is it so essential to patch together an ultrarealist picture of the Universe with whatever comes to hand just to keep God in or out of the picture?

Why the heroic theory of scientific progress is a myth.",sixbillionthsheep,34,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/cw2y4/when_the_time_is_ripe_for_certain_things_these/
&gt; The pages of the history of science record thousands of instances
of similar discoveries having been made by scientists working
independently of one another. Sometimes the discoveries are
simultaneous or almost so ; sometimes a scientist will make anew
a discovery which
before. Such occurrences suggest that discoveries become virtually
inevitable when prerequisite kinds of knowledge and tools accumulate in man's cultural store and when the attention of an appreciable number of investigators becomes focussed on a problem
by emerging social needs
or by both. 

This view culminated in the [multiple discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) theory of scientific discovery which rejects the [heroic theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_theory_of_invention_and_scientific_development) which claims science is written by a series of one-of-a-kind geniuses. 

An extensive list of multiple discoveries is posited [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries).

Merton's original paper ""Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple
Discoveries in Science"" can be downloaded [here](http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B9y5Ze4Mo8qlYzk0MDFjYjItMWVjMS00NTNjLWI2NDItMjhhMzZmMGYzNDEy&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJKw0IwE).

This is closely related to [Stigler's ""law""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law) which posits that ""No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer"" (which Stigler ironically attributes to Robert Merton).

I have a whole heap of sympathy for this view. To me, it gets vetted by a few expert readers here who spread the word in their own circles, a storm of interest eventuates and this completely unknown thinker changes science's view of the world forever .... and then s/he turns down the Nobel Prize (but not the /PhilosophyofScience pubmeet party we organise for him or her).

1266841707.0,b4zfm,Still got the Godelian-incompleteness blues? Don't want to give up on infinity? Try multiplication-free Presburger arithmetic.,sixbillionthsheep,42,13,9,"*Originally posted in [/r/PhilosophyofScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience)*.

One of the fascinating things about the Godel incompleteness results is that infinity itself is not the problem. In some systems of arithmetic you can believe you can count to infinity and still be complete and consistent. Some even include the [infinite set of induction axioms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction).

One such decidable arithmetic system is known as **[Presburger arithmetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic)**. Presburger arithmetic is essentially the [Peano axioms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms) without multiplication defined. Actually
    Exists x Forall y
whereas Fermat's last theorem is not 
    Exists X
[Presburger showed his arithmetic was decidable](http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a776183056&amp;db=all) before Godel's incompleteness results were even published. **[This page has an applet](http://www.stefan-baur.de/cs.web.mashup.presburger.html) which lets you define your own Presburger statements and illustrates how they are solved** (Note : only in German but still interesting to play with).

Yet the incompleteness problem is not even due to multiplication alone. A system with all of Peano's axioms apart from addition

So we have yet more demonstration of how easy it is to skirt Godelian incompleteness. The Godelian incompleteness results are really about carefully choosing the formal language concepts we use to describe systems we wish to use. The real problem faced by humans is not even Godelian-incompleteness

Unlike the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment which used poison gas and a radioactive decay trigger, the weapon is either deployed, killing the experimenter, or it makes an audible ""click"" and the experimenter survives.

The theories are distinctive from the point of view of the experimenter only; their predictions are otherwise identical.

The probability of surviving the first iteration of the experiment is 50%, if the Copenhagen interpretation is true, the wavefunction has already collapsed, so if the experimenter is already dead, there's a 0% chance of survival. However, if the many-worlds interpretation is true, a superposition of the live experimenter necessarily exists, it is not possible for the experimenter to experience having been killed,,

Logic and reason are extra-scientific concepts. Logic is a branch of mathematics ( a non science). Reason predates science by aeons. The edge question itself is ill-conceived sloppy thinking.

The whole history of thought is absorbed into science and is used for improving every single theory. Nor is political interference rejected. It may be needed to overcome the chauvinism of science that resists alternatives to the status quo.*

This is the opening quote of chapter 4 of Paul Feyerabend's book [Against Method](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/#2.13). We've discussed the book [in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/catcy/feyerabend_against_method/) from time to time and I think it adds a lot to the methodology debate. Feyerabend himself near the end of his life went on to say how much he despised the book. I suspect though he had just come to regret his occasional flirting with relativism. 

But this quote highlights to me, Wegener, a ""mere"" German meteorologist, was convinced the continents once formed part of a great whole which had since drifted apart. A prominent physicist at the time, Adrian Schiedegger, published a paper [""Examination of the physics of theories of orogenesis""](http://bulletin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/2/127) which provided several physical arguments why the continental drift hypothesis was impossible, just a few years before it was legitimised by the study of [plate tectonics](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/tectonics.html). See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Rejection_of_Wegener.27s_theory.2C_and_subsequent_vindication).

Wegener was attacked profusely from all academic sides. Wegener was considered an interloper and continental drift threatened the status quo in many disciplines. 

&gt; ""Utter damned rot!""

 wrote the president of the prestigious American Philosophical Society.

&gt; Anyone who ""valued his reputation for scientific sanity"" would never dare support such a theory

wrote one British geologist.

1268686829.0,bdrjy,A question to the physicalists: what is mathematics? How would you address Descartes' argument?,sixbillionthsheep,29,3,67,"Note : This is quite a metaphysical question for me but Rene Descartes really did demonstrate some serious brilliance in mathematics as well as in the sciences

---

I was reading (actually listening to) Rene Descartes' [""Discourse on Method for Reasoning Well and for Seeking Truth in the Sciences""](http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/descartes/descartes1.htm). This is the famous essay where he comes up with ""I think therefore I am"" (Part 4). As I understand the argument

&gt; *considering that all the same thoughts which we have when awake can also come to us when we are asleep

so is there anything we (actually ""I"" - it's a very personal argument - if you read all of it, must exist :

&gt; *But immediately afterwards I noticed that, I am—was so firm and so sure that all the most extravagant assumptions of the sceptics would not be able to weaken it, I judged that I could accept it without scruple as the first principle of the philosophy I was looking for.*

What I didn't know though

&gt; *After that I wanted to look for other truths, width, and height or depth, divisible into various parts, which could have various figures and sizes and be moved or transposed in all sorts of ways, for the geometricians assume all that in their subject matter. I glanced through some of their simplest proofs, and having observed that this grand certainty which all the world attributes to them is founded only on the fact that they plan these proofs clearly, I notice also that there is nothing at all in their proofs which assures me of the existence of their objects. So, it must the case that its three angles are equal to two right angles, by contrast

Now I don't want to get into a religious debate on the existence of God here. But Rene makes a valid point about mathematics doesn't he? Mathematics doesn't exist anywhere in the physical world (e.g. we can't see a mathematical triangle), some of the results are astounding elegant and amazing, it is incredibly useful for many physical pursuits, yet try to point to any physical evidence of it and it's nowhere to be seen.

So what *is* mathematics? Is it just a human construction? Then why is it so perfect and universally indisputable

Having recently read *God Delusion* and *Greatest Show* and in discussing them with fellow evolution enthusiasts and proponents

That's not to say I misunderstand evolution and think it can only evolve selfish species, particularly when coordination can give greater results per individual than would the sum of individual efforts (in collecting food in the form of large prey, say).

What Dawkins has taught me when he talks about beneficial cooperative interactions *isn't* that evolution has provided us with morality of any sort but rather a set of heuristic strategies for living in a certain environment. Think about how two troops of apes will interact when they come into contact. In spite of being capable of quite moving gentleness and affection towards one another

The reasons for this, you will develop a reputation and the others will get to know how generous or selfish you are and treat you in kind. If you are kind, other apes will treat you fondly, more likely to look after you if you are ill, etc.. If you are selfish, others will not think much of letting you have a harder time of it.

Now when it comes to members of other groups, steal from individuals of other troops. 

Given that

So it's very easy to see where this racism comes from, etc.). But since we're a global society with billions of members now instead of our classic hunter-gatherer groups, suddenly in-group/out-group thinking *isn't* very advantageous any more.

Here is where I think real morality comes in. I have come to think that morality is when we use our intellect and our reason to think about relationships and take into account everything about the interactions and come to the decision to *over rule* our natural propensities. When we decide to treat all humans equally is when we're deciding to disregard our native heuristic because it is no longer advantageous any more.

So in short, but at the very least I'm hoping to show that the development of evolved behaviour strategies and reasoned morality are categorically different things.

(2) God did X

You see that kind of underhanded bullshit from the Discovery Institute so much that their press releases look like Mad Libs: ""----- doesn't have a current Naturalist Scientific explanation

I call that the *non-answer*: don't you dare provide some kind of explanatory content to your answer, don't ever admit you've made any past mistakes; press on, Hannibal! It's the empty response of a child or Senator caught with his hand in the cookie jar or paramour: the child or Senator just divert attention long enough for everyone else to move on to the latest panty-flash photo of a starlet.

**II.**

The current problem in the debate over Methodological Naturalism, probably as a result of taking words to mean the Essence of the word. Science adopts Methodological Naturalism, of course, because Science is Essentially Applied Naturalism. And Naturalism? It's the study of whatever is Natural, of course. And Natural? It's whatever is Testable. By the way, whatever is Supernatural is whatever is untestable. Game over. 

Sorry if I sound a bit peeved, *does* have a legitimate objection: by *a priori* defining science as unable to test supernatural claims, there's no explanation as to *why* 'supernatural' solutions don't cut the mustard. They've just defined it by fiat. So let's turn it around for a sec and try it this way:

Scientists are interested in solving problems. If your solution has no explanatory content *besides* a name, you need to explain how you think it works. You know, provide some explanatory content, some meat other scientists can chew on, something scientists can *criticize*.

And as it so happens, these non-answer traditionally supernatural claims are just *a small subset* of all the non-answers available. The distinction between 'supernatural' and 'natural' answers is *at most* misleading labels for saying ""I'll call it Gary the Monster. Don't ask me how Gary does it, or why, because who the fuck knows?"" and ""Here's how I think it works. Bonus: here's how it can be tested.""

1289322594.0,e3jry,The traditional story of the culture hero applied to today's scientists,drunkentune,30,7,34,"Some thoughts on how scientists are treated by the *public*

**I.**

Most everyone knows the story of Oedipus meeting the Sphinx -- how he bests it by solving its riddle, and ruins his life. So what?

The Sphinx is four things in one: the body of a lioness, and the tail of a serpent -- she is part of the primordial world of chaos, full of monsters and those dark scary things that are hiding just behind you when you're in the dark, born before the first gods came. *Ooga booga!*

Oedipus's story is similar to its historical precedents: Achilles beats down a river god, Odysseus defeats the cyclops -- and its antecedents: St. George defeats the dragon, [all those kids confronting It](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_%28novel%29), etc. [These are very popular stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_%28cosmogony%29). It's part of the story of the culture hero versus the chaos monster, where the hero fights, then subdues the chaos monster and returns to the village or city-state, where he is showered with praise, and money

**II.**

However, unravels the riddle.

And what of Oedipus? His power the extent to which he can extend or express his Will. This is a trap that will snare Oedipus: he begins to feel that he can control his own life solely from the influence of his Will; he produces order or a paradigm from which to view/influence the world; he places limits on the world around him, no matter how strongly he exerts his Will onto others, the world pushes back. That's why even though he tried to change the course of history, he unwittingly kills his dad, nails his mom, and generally screws up the lives of everyone in Thebes. His mental map of the world is inconsequential to the unknowable forces that influence his life.

We can give meaning to our lives by acting out into the world, *culturally, solving the riddles of the universe is the same as killing the chaos-monster.*

**III.**

The problem is that *we* are dealing with a chaos-monster that will not die. The chaos that bubbles underneath the surface doesn't follow this traditional narrative. It's not The Hero With a Thousand Faces or a Positivist understanding of approaching certainty. It is the many-headed Hydra, we would be unable to cope with such a shift in understanding, for the world is vast, dark, and indifferent.

Newton? He thought he could explain away the mystery and failed. Bohr's model of the atom couldn't stand up.

**IV.**

Think of the world's reaction to Einstein: he was hailed as a hero, and so on. 

He was Time's Person of the 20th Century

And yet, keeps coming back, and yet we see it only as a small patch-job for the foundations of science.

1282855641.0,d5v90,The Duhem Problem,drunkentune,25,2,6,"**I. So what exactly is the Duhem problem?**

The Duhem problem can be expressed as follows: 

&gt;A physicist disputes a certain law; he calls into doubt a certain theoretical point. How will be justify these doubts?  From the proposition under indictment he will derive the prediction of an experimental fact; he will bring into existence the conditions under which this fact should be produced; if the predicted fact is not produced, Princeton University Press. Translated from the French by Philip P. Wiener.1954, p. 184)

&gt;By means of this mode of inference we falsify the whole system (the theory as well as the initial conditions) which was required for the deduction of the statement p, specifically upset by the falsification. Only if p is independent of some part of the system can we say that this part is not involved in the falsification. (Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*, 76)

A naive theory of science might say that when testing a theory T

1. If T is true

2. Not-O.

3. T is false.

However, which I will refer to as 'background knowledge' (K). Since the scientist accepts a great deal of background knowledge, *including conjectures about the validity of the observation report*, the status of the modus tollens argument looks something like this:

1. If T and K1 and K1 ... and Kn is true

2. Not-O.

3. Either T or K1 or K2 ... or Kn is false.

A 'critical experiment', is never as decisive as one would wish. Either the theory under examination is false, or a piece of the background knowledge, including how the test was prepared, is false. Thus, there are three possible choices the scientist can make: either they (1) protect the fundamental theory by suggesting an error in the experimental setup, (2) challenge one piece of the background knowledge

**II. A methodological response to the logical problem**

No matter the choice made by the scientist, criticizing any particular philosophy of science by resorting to the Duhem problem does not discredit the theory, since there are, and can be, no other approaches that eliminate the theory-dependence, even if these theories are implicit, of observation-reports. Duhem, provided an early methodological or heuristic to follow: he hoped that the theory, while not justifying the truth of any theory (for no justification can be found)

There is no logic or automatic method for determining if the theory, ranging from revision or rejection of the theory, modification of background knowledge, or denial of the observation-report. Both Popper and Duhem proposed similar principles for the scientist, namely that criticism should first be directed towards the competing theories rather than background knowledge, and a check of the observation-report to determine if it is the result of experimental error.

(As an aside, a possible conflict between a universal statement and an existential statement -- has been superseded by Bartley's demarcation criteria of the *criticizability* of statements -- a proposal is rationally adopted if there are some significant criticisms that it has overcome, the Duhem problem does not invalidate Popper's solution to the demarcation problem. Popper stressed in his *Logic* that the assumed background knowledge, along with initial conditions, are necessary in order to test a theory. The Duhem problem is only directed at any singular attempt at falsifying a theory: it's much harder than you'd think.)

**III. Clarifying the response**

&gt;... if we take each of the two theories (between which the crucial experiment is to decide) together with all this background knowledge, but of the theory together with that background knowledge; parts of which, if other crucial experiments can be designed, may indeed one day be rejected as responsible for the failure. (Popper, *Conjectures and Refutations*, 1963, 112

Popper is on to something of importance here: there may be many cases in the history of science where two different systems differ only in the two competing theories in question. In this case, there do exist other cases where the two rival systems are divided by many assumptions. This is the kind of revolutionary science described by Kuhn's paradigm theory. 

These situations are somewhat rare and not as revolutionary as one would think, remain intact. However, these are the kind of situations where a great amount of time may be needed to parse out the implications of the rival systems until one system appears to be superior to the other. This may take decades. It may be better to keep two competing theories that are presently equally corroborated by the present data than jumping the gun and choosing one over the other. Between these two extreme situations, there exist a spectrum of time and energy necessary, along with a spectrum of crucial to not-so-crucial tests that can be conducted, to resolve the problem of which rival theory is to be preferred.

**IV. The distinction between '*ad hoc*' and 'auxiliary hypotheses'**

An *ad hoc* adjustment or 'saving throw' is an addition or change to background knowledge that weaken the chances to put it to the test. As I note in [*The problem with ad hoc adjustments to thoeries*](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/cy8o9/the_problem_with_ad_hoc_adjustments_to_theories/)

Auxiliary hypotheses may be introduced, the auxiliary hypothesis of the existence of the planet Neptune was introduced to account for the irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. This addition to the background knowledge is not *ad hoc* in nature, since the location of the hypothetical planet was predicted with great precision. Thus, Neptune was located rapidly by two independent observers, making a significant problem for Newtonian theory into a vindication for the theory when an exactly predicted unobserved planet was put to the test. In short, the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis *strengthens* the theoretical system only if it increases the chances to put it to the test.

Popper adopts this preference for auxiliary hypotheses over *ad hoc* adjustments not due to any sort of justification (this path isn't open to anyone due to the failures of justificationism; see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/d1gwj/a_short_review_of_the_long_history_of_the_problem/)), there would be no way to determine whether or not the theory is true or false in this case, since it has made it *verboten* to test it in some way. If scientists want each progressive theory to explain more about the world than the theories they supersede, any sort of adjustment to a theory must explain more about the world, that is, be as testable as possible.

Lakatos, Lakatos argued that theories are couched in a ""protective belt"" of auxiliary hypotheses which can be modified to rescue the core theory when empirical evidence appears to run contrary to the theory's predictions. He called the combination of this core theory with the protective belt of assumptions a ""research program"". 

He divides these research programs into ""progressive"" and ""degenerating"" research programs. Progressive research programs all predict novel facts - either undreampt of

-----------------

One of the aims of science, to borrow a phrase from Bacon. &lt;Bacon? Why, I *love* bacon!&gt; Think of the laws of nature as being general truths, or as they're known in predicate logic, *universal statements* (""for all x, y""). So the question, to rephrase [David Byrne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiEpH4mQRMQ) is

The popular answer is by 'inductive inference'

     This bacon is crispy.
     That bacon is crispy.
     ...
     Therefore

&lt;[Hope it's bacon for me!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nT9P8MMpsE)&gt;

Scientists may infer that a universal statement holds when they have observed a sufficient number of instances of the law. Corroborating scientific theories through repeated testing is the key. And then there was Sextu-

And then there was Hume. [2]

Hume's problem of induction is quite simple: you can't get there from here. His argument is the following:

     (1) General laws are attained by inductive inference.
     (2) Inductive inference is unjustified.
     (3) If an inference is unjustified
     Therefore

A common characteristic of all deductive logics is that the conclusion of a valid inference is implicit in the premises; or

The proof runs as follows. Let the statements ""This is a piece of bacon and it is crispy"" (B*a*)

If B*a*⋀B*c*⋀B*d*⋀ ... ⋀B*r* ⇒ B*s* were analytic, B*c*, B*d*, ... B*r* all be true. This logical inference would provide all the inductive inference scientists need. But should B*a*, B*c*, B*d*, ... B*r* be all true, so the if-then statement would also be false. Hence it is not an analytic truth

As Karl Popper said

Popper again: 

&gt;I formulate Hume's logical problem of induction as follows: 

&gt;(L1) Can the claim that an explanatory universal theory is true be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, are 'based on experience')? 

&gt;My answer to the problem is the same as Hume's: No

&gt;There is a second logical problem

&gt;(L2) Can the claim that an explanatory universal theory is true or that it is false be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, are 'based on experience')? 

&gt;To this problem

A false test statement, his use of the word ""justified"" needs to be rejected. Popper was so close, yet so far. But that's for a future post. Instead, I'll give induction the strongest defense I can by covering the most common proposed solutions to the problem of induction.

-----------------------

**I.** The naive solution is to *posit a uniformity of nature*. That is, the future will always resemble the past. Statements about the present and past are predictive statements about the future if nature is uniform in respect to this scientific theory, but scientists do not know whether or not nature is uniform in respect to this scientific theory. 

This solution moves the problem of induction 'one step back'. Since the principle of induction is not synthetic

&lt;Where did all the funny bacon references go? I'm narwhaling to bacon an upvote  — I mean

**II.** A second solution is to retreat to assigning a probability about future events. Inductive inferences don't always work

First, please.&gt;, the universal statement will always have a greater logical content.

Even if it was valid to retreat to probability

If we were to weaken inductive inference to the point where induction gives only ""Probably, if Popper's formulation of the problem of induction were instead ""Can the claim that a [predictive statement] is true be justified by 'empirical reasons'; that is, by assuming the truth of certain test statements or observation statements (which, it may be said, are 'based on experience')?"", again the answer is 'No'; Hume's problem of induction is not restricted to conclusions about the truth of predictions, nor is it restricted to universal statements. As demonstrated previously

**III.** A third solution is to give up on inductive inference while still agreeing with Hume's skeptical conclusion: we cannot have knowledge of general laws the same way as in a priori disciplines

If we *dogmatically* break off the justification, Derrida, Foucault, &amp;c.

'Reality' is only accessible to us in terms of how we understand and interpret it. If there is no foundation to construct a system of knowledge

Any questions?

To my layman's eye, does the T.M. practice of the commissioner of the study (the president of the university) as well as the participation of one prominent researcher affiliated with the T.M. organization (Grosswald), invalidate the study?

All the recent independent meta-analysis that conclude that no existing research on meditation (especially on T.M.) is acceptable would eliminate the above study because of the affiliations and lack of blinding of the subjects.

For example, so evolution can be just as real. But, to me, a ""theory of gravity"" means an answer to a ""how come"" question, not merely a description of a phenomenon - and these theories is not so everyday. So, I would differentiate between:

* *Fact* (a trusted observation): a specific object fell toward Earth.
* *Law of gravity* (a generalisation formed from a set of facts): physical bodies attract each other with a force proportional to their mass.
* *Theory of gravity* (an explanation of specific facts and laws): general theory of relativity.

Someone may say that there is a ""Newton's Theory of Gravity"", because the phrase ""theory of X"" should carry a meaning of ""explanation of X"". Therefore, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton's Gravitational Theory of Celestial Mechanics would be two connected but distinct constructs.

Initially that matter is just a frothing soup of hot particles zipping around, bouncing off each other -- sometimes 'annihilating,' new particles continuously being 'created' to take their place.  It's basically chaos^infinity.

As the universe continues to expand, those particles don't have enough energy maintain the intensely chaotic nature of their interaction.

First, protons and neutrons begin combining into deuterium and helium nuclei, along with a smattering of other light elements.

Eventually, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters of clusters...

And through it all, future generations of stars form orbited by planetary systems containing solid, rocky planets.

The presence of those rocky planets, highly ordered electronic systems.  In at least one instance, and likely more, this resulted in the development of an organic chemistry so complex that life as we define it emerged and evolved into increasingly complex molecular structures, systems of molecular structures, cells, multicellular organisms, and on and on.

Despite all this, it says, will tend to increase the overall disorder of the universe.  As far as we know, this law holds.  This evolutionary progression I've outlined cannot have violated it: all of the individual processes must have somehow increase the overall disorder.

A thought struck me while I was in a [restaurant in Budapest](http://www.gerloczy.hu/) feeling like a complete tourist. I had ordered a stick of bread and the (non-English speaking) waiter later came to tell me something about ""half"". I wasn't sure what he meant. They only have half sticks left? They are half price? They're closing in half an hour? For a brief period we gesticulated and tried to explain ourselves in our own languages to no avail. How can I ever be sure what he means if his explanations can only be achieved by using other words that are equally uncertain to my ears? How can meaning ever truly be pinned down without a qualified translator?

The highly influential 20th Century philosopher of science and logician [Williard Van Orman Quine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine) discussed this in his **[indeterminacy of translation thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_of_translation)** of languages in his book [Word and Object](http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/quine.html). This extract from the wikipedia page captures it well :

&gt; Consider Quine's example of the word ""gavagai"" uttered by a native upon seeing a rabbit. The linguist could do what seems natural and translate this as ""Lo, a momentary rabbit-stage""; ""Lo, an undetached rabbit-part."" Some of these might become less likely – that is, become more unwieldy hypotheses – in the light of subsequent observation. Others can only be ruled out by querying the natives: An affirmative answer to ""Is this the same gavagai as that earlier one?"" will rule out ""momentary rabbit stage,"" and so forth. But these questions can only be asked once the linguist has mastered much of the natives' grammar and abstract vocabulary; that in turn can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language; and those sentences, on their own, as we have seen.

(Sounds like Quine was a heck gavagai no? :P)

At this time I started to understand more clearly what Quine was on about in his famous [Two Dogmas of Empiricism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism) paper when he was attacking both the notions of [verificationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism) and [falsificationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Falsificationism). The laws of nature are like the grammar and vocab of a foreign language. When we try to pin down the truth of some law of nature by experiment, require experimentation themselves. If I test a substance for the presence of gold, am I sure my equipment is working? Am I sure there the test isn't affected by the magnet that is in the next room? Am I sure some daily solar event has no influence? Remember the [loss of the scurvy cure](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/bazh0/in_the_second_half_of_the_nineteenth_century_the/)? They had made an erroneous background assumption that lemons and limes had the same curative properties. 

Here is what Quine says in Two Dogmas :
&gt; The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs… is a man-made fabric which impinges on experiences only along the edges… A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments over some of our statements. Reevaluations of some statements entails reevaluation of others, experience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary experience

So basically no experiment will definitively validate or falsify a hypothesis - we can always adjust our other background beliefs to accommodate.

So what do people think of Quine's explanation of science as a hidden language? (Some might be tempted to say the 
language of the god/s?) Are we bound to be naive foreigners who can find their way around but never understand the familial nuances of the scientific language?

I very much encourage you to find the time to carefully read [this long article](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes) on Bayes' theorem. The author attempts to fully explain the (simple) math behind the theorem

&gt; Similarly, the Bayesian rules say this is impossible!  To increase the probability of a theory you must expose it to tests that can potentially decrease its probability; this is not just a rule for detecting would-be cheaters in the social process of science, but a consequence of Bayesian probability theory.  On the other hand, Popper's idea that there is only falsification and no such thing as confirmation turns out to be incorrect.  Bayes' Theorem shows that falsification is very strong evidence compared to confirmation, but falsification is still probabilistic in nature; it is not governed by fundamentally different rules from confirmation, as Popper argued.

Taleb describes himself as a skeptical empiricist. Philosophers of science would probably describe him as an extreme [scientific anti-realist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism). He attacks modern intellectuals for what he calls their platonicity - a tendency to create underlying pictures of reality that go well beyond the data. His gripe is primarily with the social sciences, attacking Nobel Prize winners such as [Robert C Merton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) (including to his face) for devising and promoting economic models which assume that market price movements behave in a log-normal fashion. It is the widespread belief in these models which he believes are the cause of financial market crashes.

The problem is, weight, IQ, mortality rates. Extremistan describes the more random nature of human constructions and some natural processes - wealth, book sales, inflation, deaths from terrorist incidents, size of planets. Western intellectuals have tried to fit normal curves to Extremistan processes. 

His book is frequently punctuated by descriptions of common fallacies

*[Ludic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy) : Trying to fit probability distributions to data without enough information and reasoning based on these false assumptions. Sometimes we have to reason without even knowing anything about the underlying distribution.*

*[Problem of silent evidence (better known as survivorship bias)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): Deriving causality from an analysis of the winners e.g. assessing the traits (such as risk-tasking appetite) in common of millionaires to explain their success without examining the many more people with those same traits that failed to be millionaires.*

*[Narrative fallacy](http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/abdallah/2009/0209.html): Fitting a story or pattern to a series of facts such as what happens in historical explanation and ignoring the many counterfactuals.*

*[Confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias): Seeking confirmatory evidence to validate preconceptions and hypotheses.*

For a video lecture detailing his thoughts in The Black Swan

Taleb's influence has been substantial. He is credited with predicting the present financial crisis (and profitting from it substantially as a result). He recently [testified in Congress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X7pNFbGjz0). He draws crowds that have Bill Gates and Michael Dell waiting in line. At times he is a pompous and haughty read - unquestionably controversial - but as of 2009
