First of all

I am currently at a state university in the United States studying higher education. I am scheduled to graduate in the spring of 2014 with a Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration. I have a graduate assistantship at the university where I am a student.


My main interests when it comes to careers in higher education are in institutional research and financial aid. As an undergraduate, I want to stay in this city and I am not sure if there will be any opportunities available in IR when I graduate (the other offices at institutions in this city are small). On the other hand, I would have to leave the office for which I work as a graduate assistant (my supervisor said that he would not prefer that I leave but would support me if I chose to do so) and I would still have to go to school while having a full-time job. I am scheduled to graduate if I take 9 hours in the fall (3 classes) and 6 hours in the spring (2 classes, one being associated with an internship that requires 150 hours of work for the semester). Needless to say, it would be a tough year but I am confident that I would be able to attend graduate school full-time and work a full-time job.

I have read several threads on reddit about college costs

This summer

This summer, this is awesome.”   

What did the legislature do?  It mandated a textbook review process.

According to Section 262a of Public Act 60 (that’s the appropriations bill)

So what does this look like?

First of, we’re talking over 2,500 courses.  Western offers almost 2,900.  U of M offers 3,400.  So we’re not talking about some small task here.

Admittedly, studio art, and similar courses often don’t require them.  However, some courses will require more than one text.  We’re talking about thousands of books and other materials.

So someone,000 courses.  That’s some staff time right there.  It’s going to take time to develop the process and communicate this to faculty, too, before the review task even begins.  Where do those people come from, and what work will they be setting aside to do this?  Whether or not this concerns you probably depends on whether you believe, as many do, that there are dozens of staff on campus with their feet up doing nothing. 

Now, there are several things involved in that.  One of them is that the university ensures the least expensive edition of a textbook available is chosen, when educational content is comparable to a more costly edition.  That probably means a couple of things.  First, they need to determine availability.  There have to be enough editions of an old version in circulation to ensure that students can get their hands on them and that they'll really be cheaper than the new version.  That’s probably not a huge deal; surely this is something that textbook dealers to on a regular basis.  However, making that check for hundreds of textbooks will take a non-trivial amount of time and effort.

More daunting is the task of determining that the content is “comparable.”  What does that process look like?  Going through two versions of the textbook, and figuring out whether the difference is meaningful?  So who do they consult when a pharmacology textbook changes its information about side effects to commonly prescribed medications?  “Hey Joe, the 10th edition notes that anemia can occur when this class of drugs is taken with certain anti-inflammatory drugs, but the 9th edition doesn’t mention this.  Anemia is a big deal, right?  So the 10th edition is probably necessary?  No?  What about cardiac arrhythmia?”  Are these the kind of conversations the Michigan Legislature wants your university administration to be having?  Or will they have faculty do this part?  Won't you have to review that process to make sure faculty aren't just rubber-stamping their colleagues' choices?

Here’s the other thing:  This process has to happen quickly.  The University of Michigan studied textbook costs a few years ago

This is helpful for many reasons.  First, it also lets them know about their own resale possibilities, so they can offer better buyback prices to current students (they can store the books themselves for resale the next term, instead of selling them back to the distributor).  Also, it gives student- and university-coordinated book sales/exchanges programs time to be updated and for students to use them.  It also gives students more time to track down other textbook resources on the internet, if they choose, because there’s selection and there is ample time for shipping.  

I don’t know how long these kinds of required book reviews are going to take

Initiatives like this drive up costs and gobble up administrator (and faculty) time.  This probably sounded really progressive to someone in our state legislature.  Finally

This is not the only requirement in Public Act 60, is generally pretty slim.

I have heard that tablet PCs (laptops) are really the most sensitive while still allowing a person to see (on the PC) what they are actually writing - but this was in the context of somebody using it in a face to face lecture.  And

Tablets (like an ipad) are a cheaper alternative

A WACOM tablet seems to be the cheapest option that would definitely work for my PC at home with an online class; but from what I understand, as the tablet does not have its own display screen.  Thus it would be difficult to go back later and add superscripts/subscripts to an existing equation, for instance.

One issue that is very pertinent is the role of non-classroom

Some of the challenges that play out with these types of teaching and learning models include persistence (the number of students who drop out of MOOCs, there is a large number of professionals, specifically faculty, that do not place a lot of value into the learning that occurs in some of the for-profit models.  Third, these types of courses are being made more and more necessary (or at least, that's what we're being told) but there isn't any remarkable success in the delivery of these courses.

Feel free to take this discussion in any way that you feel is necessary.  I'm hoping that everyone in /r/highereducation can, I'm coming from a student affairs perspective and so persistence is a big concern for me.

I'm trying to talk to a wide variety of sources because obviously I have my views about it all, but I don't want that coming across in the book. Ideally I'd like to find current college students from as many states as possible, and from as many socioeconomic backgrounds as possible.

I just had the idea to make something tangible out of this a few days ago so I have nothing to show for it yet. But I really want this to happen some day, all!

1350464152.0,11meiz,"Teacher training in The Netherlands: ""Human Dynamics""",blacknumber1,4,2,0,"Dear (would-be) teachers

I'm an English teacher in the Netherlands at a vocational school. Our collective labor agreement stimulates ""continuous learning"" for teachers and I agree that as individuals we should be inclined to keep developing our skills. However

Just to offer a little context: education in NL is moving towards a more student-centered approach, learning disabilities etc.

I like to think that I'm a very involved/concerned teacher

One of the ""professional"" training courses I have to follow is called ""Human Dynamics"" - a concept/theory invented by an American ""doctor"" named Sandra Seagal and her husband: to me it's the biggest load of bullshit I've ever read/heard and I want to hear your thoughts on this. 

So

Basically, and physical.

Everyone contains a combination of these three aspects
mental-emotional
emotional-physical
physical-emotional etc.

Apparently

So

*talks often
*easily makes contact with others
*in touch with own feelings
*trusts emotions
*relates everything to oneself
*creative, versatile, wide-ranging interests

The whole point is that I'm supposed to become aware of and exploit all these differences so everyone can work together and everyone can learn in their own way (the individualistic credo). 

Again, but I don't think it's very useful; I'm open-minded to things, but this is just too much. 

I'm young (25)


Does anyone else have any similar experiences? I hear Human Dynamics also really caught on in Sweden.

The URL is [ http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

All you need to sign up is a .edu email address. As an avid user of the world wide web I know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at jhamilton@openleaf.me

Hopefully those of you that are still students and try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.

Also before you say anything

TL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.

I have a couple of questions to ask, I graduated high school at the very end of 2010 (I took an extra semester) and September 2011 I started my first year of University. Now I found it hard to know what I wanted to do and ended up not enjoying my first year (ECE), so after my first year I dropped and worked for a year because I wanted to move to BC, which I will be actually arriving to next week. I want to go to UBC for next September 2014, and take Biology. The classes I took in Ontario don't meet all the program requirements but I'll be taking adult school in BC to make up for the few that I need. Now first, I know you guys will wonder why I didn't ask a high school adviser this question but by the time I actually wondered how this works high school were closed already for the summer and I don't someone directly from there to ask.
But okay, I don't want to take extra classes if I don't have to.
These are the specific provincial requirements for the two provinces

Ontario:

English 12 (ENG4U) ***

Advanced Functions (MHF4U) (minimum 67%)

 [1]
One of Biology 12 (SBI4U)

Three other Grade 12 4U or M courses ***

Chemistry 11 (SCH3U)***

BC:

English 12 or English 12 First Peoples

Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 (minimum 67%)

Two other approved Grade 12 courses, Geography 12, Geology 12, or Physics 12

Chemistry 11
 
So yeah, I want to take as little classes as possible in the adult school and hopefully I can apply to UBC earlier for January 2014.

Second questions is though

For the first time I have had to face the question: what type of room do you place a trans-sexual student in university housing?  The ideal answer is obviously gender neutral housing but at my institution that is not an option.

We have a student who was born male but is transitioning to be a female.  I neither know nor want to know at what stage in the process she is.  Looking at her you would never be able to tell but in the system she is still under her birth name and sex.  

My colleagues and I had a long discussion whether to place her in a male of female room.  This student is well known in our office and we all refer to her as her. 

It is clear that this student identifies as a woman, and has had cosmetic surgery to give herself breasts.  Our discussion ultimately defaulted to our policy and we went by birth sex.  Luckily, we had an open male room in a suite so she had her own living space and only had to share a bathroom.  

I see the benefit of defaulting to the policy.  It is a CYA move; which is sometimes the answer BUT I believe that this solution is one that ignores the needs of our students

Unfair that a non-profit can NOW use For Profit tactics

Seems like something is amiss.

I half feel like alerting our regional accreditation council. 

Know anyone else going through this? 

Some of the practices:
- several times a day emails saying how poorly we are doing
- Telling all team members everyone's numbers and in front of everyone
- writing up people with letters in their employee files saying their work is substandard (and this is for folks that haven been recruiting successfully for 6 years
- Since this team has arrived, but they are good in sales.
