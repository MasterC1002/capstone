I've never shed tears over a show before or ever enjoyed a show/movie as I did tonight. Ima do my best to put why this was perfect to me. Maybe a little long but this is well deserving.

•The Battle - Was perfect. With all hope lost and sorely out numbered I feared that this above all would be interesting but mostly a massacre. Yet Steven Deknight showed us wrong. Spartacus' Mind of war shone through and one moment to the next was a rush and even had me believing they may win until the inevitable falls.

 •Everyone of our favorite characters were giving justice. Whether by their deaths or slipping away

 • Lugo went out in Flames

 • Saxa went out like the bad chick she is. She also found herself in Gannicus arms for the last time.

 • Nevia who I liked personally

 • Gannicus getting crucified broke me. But the way they portrayed his death was glorious

 •Everything they did with Spartacus and the flashbacks and Moments of season 1 and Sura was amazing. I had chills when I saw Agrons shield. We all wondered how Spartacus body was never found and we found out

 • I Loved how they didn't really stray from history, We see a glimpse of the first Triumvirate forming, Spartacus body never found, who's to say that this may not have been what really happened? That a small band of rebels took a different route and wasn't never found out?..

 • in conclusion. My favorite show past four years or so Gave me more than I could ask for, finally a episode out did ""kill them all"" in my opinion.. The credits paid Tribute to all the cast..

• I Am Spartacus from Andy Whitfield at the very end was the cherry on top of the best hour of television I've witnessed. RIP Andy

 •RIP Spartacus

1362960838.0,1a1v0n,"""Spartacus"" Trivia (spoilers!)",Zenrot,109,13,41,"Just some fun facts I've noticed about the show

Spartacus Trivia:

* The races of some characters have been altered for the sake of the show. Oenomaus was historically a Gaul (Numidian on the show)

* Of the confirmed homosexual fighter characters, Nasir, and Castus fight with spears. Gneus fights with a Trident. 

* All of the gladiators from the House of Batiatus keep their standard equipment for most battles, however, often wields only a single sword with no shield.

* Crixus' title of ""The Undefeated Gaul"" is a play on words regarding the famous sculpture *The Dying Gaul*

* Crixus and Naevia are the longest lasting characters on the show

* Due to an actress change for the character Naevia

* Peter Mensa (Oenomaus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) have the exact same lifespan in the show. Both were present for all of ""Gods of the Arena""

* Spartacus and Crixus both lose a child in a situation involving Lucretia. 

* Despite killing the most characters on the show, make two attempts to kill Illythia and considered killing Laeta.

* Historically Crixus was stated to have curly blonde hair

* Actor Andy Whitfield (Spartacus in Blood and Sand) had a tattoo on his forearm in the exact spot of his slave brand. 

* Multiple characters on the show have had ""stays of execution"", Lugo, and Donar.

* Despite being labeled a failure

* All of Spartacus' depicted victories over Praetor's in the show are a result of a bold

* Despite attempting to wait the rebels out on top of Vesuvius being labeled a ""foolish move"" by Glaber

* Varinius only engages Spartacus once

* Crixus, eel, and crab, respectively. 

* Gannicus and Theokoles are the only gladiators with tattoos. 

* Siaosi Fonua (Hamilcar in ""Blood and Sand"") is killed in season 1 by a Roman guard. He appears again in ""War of the Damned"" as a Cilician pirate who is quickly dispatched by Gannicus.

* Caesar is one of the few Romans in the show to hold to some idea of justice. While all the main antagonists have attempted something immoral (Batiatus uses murder and blackmail, Crassus sells Laeta to the Cilicians as a slave), Caesar is shown to be greatly enraged by acts of cruelty towards his people. He weeps at the site of Fabia asking him to take her life. He is incredibly kind towards Laeta and is visibly furious as Crassus sells her later in the episode. He also seems to show a level of respect for slaves who have proven themselves (although not as much admiration as Crassus holds for Spartacus), as he compliments Donar after their battle.

* Spartacus and Gneus are the only gladiators who have been seen switching styles. Spartacus changed from a Thraex to a Dimachaeri

* The most highly skilled gladiators on the show are often depicted as Dimachaeri-class, Gannicus, Oenomaus, Theokoles, and the Egyptian all do this.

* Gannicus is likely the most skilled warrior in unarmed combat. In fact

* Theokoles is an albino. This accounting for his pale skin

* The only gladiators to ever stand against Theokoles and survive all come from the House of Batiatus, and Crixus. 

* Josef Brown (Auctus) is a professional dancer as well as actor

* Marcus Crassus is mentioned multiple times in the series before his appearance. He is mentioned more than once in Blood and Sand as cousin to Licinia

* Caesar has intense distaste towards the Cilicians on the show. While this could be attributed to him being a proud Roman citizen who hates pirates

* Caesar attacks Spartacus with a knife to the back during a surprise attack by his allies. This mirrors Caesar's death during the famous ""Ides of March""

* Nemetes' line ""The die has been cast""

* Though sometimes it is hard to tell

* In ""Vengeance"", arguably the most talented Roman in combat, was bested by Gannicus with little difficulty (twice) and would have been bested by Donar if not for the latter's wounds. 

* Despite being depicted as a military genius on the show

* Spartacus has a habit of adopting strategies his opponents have used on him. He attempts to starve Crassus out by forcing his soldiers to endure harsh conditions

* Marcus Crassus never had a son named Tiberius

* Heraclio refers to Spartacus as ""King Spartacus""

* Although Senator Albinius blames Glaber for bringing Spartacus to Roman soil

* The kiss between Saxa (Ellen Hollman) and Mira (Katrina Law) after their organized match during Spartacus' team building exercises was not scripted. Hollman felt it was something her character would do,,False,,t5_2srqd,1368465671.0,,True

I would like to throw one more thing out there this week. What do you guys think of trying to get the attention of Starz to recognize this subreddit? I feel its safe to say this is the main subreddit for the Starz rendition of Spartacus, just having Starz, or a member of the cast, post a link the this subreddit we could see our subscribers soar. So really, this is me asking you all to spread this subreddit. If anyone has connections to any of the cast or crew it would be greatly appreciated, but that is definitely a long shot. Anyways, just me rambling again. I just love to see the community grow. I joined when there was under 100 people I believe and as I write this now we have 802. A good climb.

---

&gt;**A Grueling Beginning**

Any viewer will likely agree in the distastefulness, the Red Serpent, is the much-needed de-virginizing to Spartacus’ beginning, yet shown with tactlessness and paired with an ear of corn. It’s straight cheddar, and it *knows* it. The effects, the dialogue, the acting, and it arrives in spades. We also see the potential of its core values that are further expanded upon.

 
We see the show is willing to accept criticism of vulgar content, and wade through lines of painful dialogue delivered through gritted teeth. Only the label of *guilty pleasure* can stand here, *with the label of “class” unraveling upon entering the house of Batiatus*. 


If one is not deterred from the first episode, crafting its own linguistic style that is both ingenious in its vulgarity as in its quotability and appeal to metaphor. The SFX do not improve until much later, but the themes of combat, brotherhood, and noble ideals begin to appear. A viewer here is still unsure of the show’s prowess. 


By Episode 4, immersion, and the life of a Lanister. The first season’s story arc takes time to blossum, but that time is well rewarded. *Spartacus himself is a naïve, foolish, and stubborn man before episode 7. Every action twists arm of viewer and forces anger to bud. Without hesitation, Spartacus is quite possibly the most bull-headed protagonist in any show up until around episode 8 or so. 

**This of course, the audience does as well**.


The show, nudity, content, violence, plot, character manipulation, motivation of action, props, the show matures before our eyes. If a fan pays tribute and honors the show

---

&gt;**Immersion, and an uncompromising vision**


History books, and know the course of events as if blessed by the Gods themselves. Yet no matter how many times we can *read* about the horrors of war, the atrocities of slavery, or the true representation of objectifying people, nothing compares to the *visual splendor and realism of Spartacus.* It is both highly stylized and yet *real*ized. It fills in gaps in understanding the way no history book can do. While it takes some liberties with historical accounts, it’s also accurate in its depiction of major events, leaving skilled writers to fill the gaps with creativity and fiction – all grounded in believability as the show progresses. 


**No other show, with 40+ hours of an immersive, fully-fledged world created for us, the fans/audience. The moment you see Batiatus engaging in complex conversation with Lucretius, his wife, whilst being pleasured by a slave in a manner too casual to understand, while topless slaves stand idly by as props, is the moment you begin to sense and acknowledge the social shackles of servitude within Rome. 


*Everyone in the show answers to someone of a higher status*, and the motivations. The show pulls no punches in its depictions of such things, and in fact revels in the vulgarity of it. Protagonists bare full-frontals, main characters are torn apart before our eyes, and the words “Jupiter’s Cock” bellow from many a mouth. **What we’re left with is a sense of awe and directness, refreshing in its portrayal, and ever pleasing to the primal senses.** 



Not only are we capable of teleporting to ancient Rome to view such atrocities, status, and the world we live in presently; the show is for all intents and purposes *uncompromising and authentic*.  What at first rings of “guilty pleasure” in its nudity, vulgarity, and violence becomes a staple of authenticity. The character we grow to love and cherish become fully realized and personal in acts of intimate love, or acts of intimate death.  

---

&gt;**Interlacing the motif; succeeding as a series**


From my own personal philosophy, every character, every villain, every action is seeping with tense, well-crafted end goals. 


*Each demise of hero a true scar upon psyche, to the tear-stricken eyes of a lost friend felt as if true Brother had fallen, to the relishing of conniving ploy used to gain political advantage, this show is a textbook when it comes to infusing emotion in a viewer*. To be blunt, the writing and dialogue are *excellent beyond comprehension* - a notion unbelieved when juxtaposed to the clunkiness of the first 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1 (there are 3.5 seasons, .5 belonging to a well-received prequel showcasing Gannicus, *my personal favorite character anywhere*).

One of the most impressive and as-of-yet unconventional depictions of homosexuality is also present throughout. In the presence of large hulking men, but I've not laid eyes upon a show that depicts a homosexual relationship as something so casual yet non-stereotypically masculine and in line with the nature of the times. It never elevates or segregates these relationships, but showcases equal footing. Such elements are worthy of respect. 


We see true character and developmental arcs in this series in a way that is incomparable to other envisionings. From the Ludas of Batiatus in its downfall, to the battles on the fields of the damned, the protagonists, antagonists, and side-plots develop the story and immersion in magnificent spectacle. With every minor victory, the filming places catharsis on a pedestal, and pretty much makes the viewer raise arm to the heavens in pure ecstasy (or at least was mine and friends’ reaction

---

&gt;**Overcoming difficulties; the Loss of a Star**


Perhaps this is one causal reason why Fans of the show are so honored by it: the protagonist of Season 1, yet somehow, his replacement, Liam, managed not only to stay afloat atop such lofty expectations, but exceled in soaring above them. 



To be honest, loving the show in a whole new light. For a show that highlights the glory of final decision, in death, the passing of Andy intertwined the show with his glory. 
It’s quite difficult to watch a show and sequester personal beliefs in hopes of positioning oneself into the structure of intolerance. To fulfill role and imagine oneself in the shoes of Batiatus, or Crassus, is a feat of philosophical difficulty. To look upon the people on screen as objects, to view the *human beings* as nothing more than tools is a complete necessity in understanding the motivations of all involved. What appears on a surface level as softcore porn and gratuitous violence is the most immersive lesson on the subjects of Brotherhood, slavery, justifying action, and status no history book could really teach. 



*To add to its luster by being highly polished



**TL;DR**


*Spartacus is a triumph on various levels. A surface level joy with ample nudity and savage violence, maxims, and motivations of developing characters, based on such an anarchistic time-period. Devotees are rewarded with ever-improving direction and narrative, as the body and heart itself of every viewer is elevated ferociously in the regaling of such a tale. To endure full-lengths’ journey is to endure voluptuous ranges of emotion, horrible and glorious alike. I implore anyone with mature mind and desire to see spirits soar partake in magnificent media: For Spartacus!*

_________________________________________________________

So, for rebels and Romans alike. The only downside was the capture of Ilithyia. I do not see either side benefiting from this as I feel at this point Glaber does not care for her health, only his heir's and Spartacus would rip her to shreds, which I do not see Gannicus or Oenomaus allowing anytime soon. Do you think Gannicus will bring her to the rebels? I can assume now he will join the rebels, he has to, but do you think he will bring Ilithyia to Spartacus? No good can come of that, only chaos

The only other major point I wish to bring up is Glaber laying with Seppia. What do you make of this? I for one hate the bitch. Forgive my bluntness but she connives just as much as Lucretia and Iliythia yet she is half their age. I do not like this new man Glaber has become. He was a man of honor only seeking out defectors and rebellious slaves (not saying slavery is right only justifying current actions!).  He truly has become corrupt

Anyways

NOT GOING ANYWHERE

Spartacus: protected by history

Crixus: protected by history

Naevia: killing her off after spending half the season looking for her is too nihilistic even for DeKnight.  Looks like she's an archer in battle even with all that sword training

Lucretia: if the Blood &amp; Sand finale couldn't kill her not much can

Illythia: hard to see who would have motive if Sparty wouldn't do it.  Was Lucretia in on killing Seppia?  It seemed like she actually wanted Glaber killed...

Saxa: she seems to be getting built up to be a semi-major character

Nagron:  I think they're safe given their status as the show's Official Gay Couple Who Does Not Have Sex On Camera Or Show Their Penises.  Agron's also too indispensable given his role with the Germans.

COULD BE IN TROUBLE

Mira: On the one hand, and might be too indispensable to the group.  I certainly would hate to see her go.

Gannicus:  Doesn't seem likely given the show's depiction that nobody can even touch this guy when it comes to fighting

Oenomaus:  On the one hand, and if they were going to have him die I think they'd have done it in the fight with the Egyptian.  I don't see how he could still be fighting physically  in Ep.10, so I guess if he died he'd have to die of his wounds.  Bottom line, I think he's safe, because if they gave us the detail of him losing an eye but being more or less able to walk away, they are going to have to give us at least a few episodes of Oenomaus alive and well but with a badass eye patch.

Ashur:  I could see him living to ensure some continuity with the villains, and Lucretia is due for a coup of some sort...  I'd like to see him weasel away from the battlefield only to come home and get pwned by ""loving wife...""

SAY YOUR GOODBYES

Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber: I think we all know this is coming

Donar: they seemed to show him fighting a lot in Ep 9

Salvus: Glaber's tribune who gets his ass kicked by Ashur

So, historically, was a general in Spartacus's army. What a twist that would be. A slave recruited by Ashur becoming a major general for Spartacus? I hope this comes to fruition. What do you all think? 

Another high point in this episode was in the same scene: Sepius's demise. How do you all feel of this? I for one am so glad to see his life forever taken. He was a little shit. Always speaking absent thought. Holding Virinious's cock in mouth. He deserved his fate, was a defining moment for him. I think Glaber changed. I do not believe we will see him so timid ever again. Ilithyia has finally pushed him over the edge. He has been set on path. Thoughts forward on to darker days. Blood soaked days. I for one love it! But again, I feel he has largely changed since the beginning, do you agree?

Lastly, Caesar would never be able to defeat Spartacus, Crixus, or Gannicus. They are hardened gladiators who have laid waste to countless men. If Caesar kills any of those 3, I'm calling complete bullshit.

So, but what role do you think he will play in Glaber's game? 

One more question to end my rant and I believe this question won't be answered until the end of the season, but I believe she is playing Ilithyia to try and win favor again to help aid in her coming vengeance, hence the season's name! Do not think that the term vengeance only applies to Spartacus and Crixus. I believe we will see multiple people get their vengeance (or better - revenge) this season. Think, Gannicus v. Oenomaus, Lucretia v. Ilithyia, Ashur v. Everybody(I am thinking this will be Crixus specifically), and of course Spartacus v. Glaber. As well, but I remember a scene where he told Spartacus (or was it Crixus?) what his brother called him.

1. He forgives Kore and Caesar immediately when he realizes what a dick Tiberius was. He's not so arrogant to deny his faults when he sees them. 

2. His Talk with Spartacus at the Mountaintop was one of the best this show's ever seen. By this time, doesn't even care about personally killing Spartacus or getting revenge. 

3. He knows he's been beaten in the final battle

4. Finally, and he's willing to part ways if it means putting the past behind him. 

5. FInally, knowing that being humiliated in the Senate (for ""failing"" to kill Spartacus), is just a temporary setback to true power.

1330444126.0,q9s51,Gladiators - Who are the best fighters?,phattsao,18,3,28,"My picks

1. Theokeles - No one was able to beat him 1v1.  Even Oenomaus couldn't take him down.  Won a 100v1 battle.

2. Oenomaus - Been a gladiator since he was a kid.  Trained and beat Spartacus and Crixus 1v2.  Held out against Gannicus with a dull sword

3.  Spartacus - Bringer of Rain.  Killed Theokoles (with help).  Beat 7 Roman soldiers with a wooden sword.  Can jump 30 feet off of a shield.  Frequently wins fights with multiple opponents.  

4.  Gannicus - Only slave to be granted freedom in the arena.  Though he doesn't take anything seriously

5.  Crixus - The undefeated Gaul.  Champion of Capua for many years.   Though injured by Thekoles

6. Barca:  The beast of Carthage.  Killed his own father in the arena.  Personal bodyguard to Batiatus.  Experienced in arena combat as well as unarmed brawling.  Will kill a kid

7. Dagan - The big, still manages to do well, until betrayed one final time.

8. Gnaeus - The crazed goat.  Master of the Retarius style of net and trident.  Actually manages to make this look badass in GOTA.  Easily enraged.

9.  Varro - Didn't have a lot of time to learn the ropes

10.  Ashur - By far the worst fighter in the house of Batiatus.  A snake

What confuses me is how could Crassus have planned for infiltrating Sinuessa before Spartacus even captured it? Furthermore how could he have planned to pay off the pirates with Caeser before he found out about the pirates' deal with Spartacus? 

You could say that Caeser was always going to infiltrate the rebels and that he was able to get to the pirates was a bonus. But I think this is weak and unlikely. Caeser could do nothing really damaging in the city except attempt to murder Spartacus or something and then die himself which is very unlikely. You could say he was sent to try to create dissent which he did do

Thus the original reason must be that he was just sent to spy on Spartacus and that paying off the pirates was not the original plan.",,t5_2srqd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spartacus_TV/comments/1bfc96/a_question_about_caeser/

If you haven't been aware its been rumored that a Caesar spin-off is highly likely simply given the easy marketability of the figure that is Caesar as well as the success of Spartacus. As the final episode ended we saw that Pompey came into Crassus' camp. What many would have expected, but he didn't. What came after was interesting:

&gt;CRASSUS: (to Pompey) I but honor Rome

and then

&gt;CRASSUS: (to Caesar) Supporting claim he will be made ally. We shall stand fearsome triumvirate. With means to bend the course of history. 

While some may say this was included to simply complete story lines and synch up with history, and Pompey (the triumvirate mind you!!!) just seems out of place for a series finale. Again, I would have liked to see something resolved with Pompey, but instead the writers make us think of a future between these three characters before ending an entire series. While Spartacus may be done, maybe we are seeing the start of Caesar? That last scene just seems too coincidental, too easy, for the writers to end the series on. There has to be a sequel/lead-in to Caesar. Preferably with the same actors/writers/team.

What are your thoughts?
____________________________________________________

Spartacus gives in after seeing the brand of Batiatus and says ""I bore witness to the fall of many who have called brother. You are the last yet living. Stood with me when Batiatus's ludus was laid to ruin. You honor me by standing by my side in final conflict.""

The unknown Gladiator was even seen in the scene when Spartacus dies. While the other 2 I don't even know if they were in the episode. All 3 had the same brand and escaped from the same ludus

I know they were mainly background characters but it still feels weird that they were slighted like that. They should have at least seen good deaths like Ludo and Saxa at least,False,,t5_2srqd,False,,,t3_1ca9ge

To sweeten this bitter ending, I think one of two things (or both) will happen: gannicus will escape Rome and live with the quiet slave who is in love with him (forget her name, not Saxa)..they will live out there days peacefully. Gannicus in many ways is the 'Spartacus' of the previous generation - they were both champion, they both fight with dual swords, the woman they loved were killed at the hands of a roman etc...it's these parallels that make me think they'll pick gannicus as a survivor (not to mention he is awesome).

Laeta told Crassus about Spartacus working with the Pirates

From there it seems he made contact with the pirates and bribed them.  But then somehow Caesar knew all about it and was ready on the docks.  Which seems impossible since he was stuck in the city and couldn't have heard anything.

The show makes it seem like Caesar was the one who bribed the pirates but how could he have known to do that?

Basically the question is what did Caesar do and how did he know to do it?

At the end of episode 6 we see Spartacus and Gannicus looking at the massive ditch/wall built by Crassus. We know from episode 7 that there were Roman soldiers on the other side (small numbers) but they were there. What I don't understand is; were there Roman soldiers on both sides?

Reading that myself doesn't quite make sense! lol

During episode 7 Spartacus and a few rebels engage some of the Roman, were there Roman soldiers in front of the Rebels? **If so, why didn't Crassus just attack from both ends, trapping the rebels inside?** Or, **why didn't Crassus engage them from the front at night?**

You know how some people say ""Oh

The acting was as dry and plastic as it could be. Kirk Douglas, he was just quiet. When he was supposed to be happy, he just had a little grin on his face. It was like watching a high school play where the actors are all untrained and immature kids. 

The dialogue and writing was too relaxed and modern. You could have taken any line from that movie and plugged it into any drama or sitcom from the 60s. There was no historical language at all. At one point a Roman soldier actually said ""Let's go get 'em boys!"" That kind of phrasing just doesn't fit in a period piece and that was just one of many examples. 

I can forgive the bad special effects and fight scenes. They didn't have much to build with back then and there were no such things as computers. 

But framing the movie as a ""Bible epic"" I can not forgive. Literally, telling each other they don't exist. Like the film makers were saying ""Hey, we know this is set in ancient Rome and they believed in many gods, but we know they really only believed in our god, wink-wink""

Anyway, and too extreme; but I think it paints a more accurate picture of life back then. People died, often brutally, a lot. People had sex, sometimes out in the open, a lot. People were crude and vulgar. Just because we may have evolved beyond that, doesn't mean we shouldn't portray it like that. And we certainly shouldn't try to sugarcoat it and make it a 3 hour epic happy-time Judeo-Christian love fest like that shit movie did.

BUT Has anyone else noticed the changes in the second season?
How some female characters (actress's) have been either killed off or replaced with news ones that are clearly taking on the role of killers.

I personally don't see this as being good for the series at all. Part of what made this such a great and ""fresh"" show was the fact that they didn't fall into the same old tired plot / character types of the aggressive gun/sword toting woman standing on par with some guy.   Frankly I'm tired of watching female characters playing macho roles. 

What Spartacus had was devious and manipulative females (roman women) and a more noble slave girl.  It was the working and abused slave women that stood tall in this series... not the spoiled romans..  both had their devices and abilities.
But the males were mostly limited to sword play it was the women that worked at being puppet masters.

Now we're in a rearrangement of the story were Spartacus is a general and in command of thousands against the formal armies of Rome.  The problem is where does that leave the female characters? 

With the death of Mira (what a weak ending of her character) the rising of naevia (new bad actress of the series) along with the new blond dagger chick we're going to be having supposed ""bad ass"" women on the battlefield?

*""Why not ram thy cock further into my ass?""*

The women of this series were certainly dangerous enough on their own - as vipers not bulldogs. 

Whoever got into the screenwriters head and told them that they needed to give their women swords so that they could fight along the men was pushing bullshit.
I think it's a serious bad move.   Yeah they managed to have sex scenes in the tribunes tents... why not the former slaves?

It's a seriously bad move to get rid of the loyal Mira and replace her with ""?"" 
Damnit
BIG DEAL

Lets not make Naevia a hero in the series.. I don't want that rammed down my throat.

Naevia didn't kill Asher fairly... he was already wounded. 
He could have killed her several times but he didn't because he was betting that if he showed her mercy they might let him go.  So he kept on trading blows with her trying to get her to break and stop the attack. 
She just got lucky because he let his guard down....  

I don't want to see her praised or have people walking away think she kicked his ass (you know some are thinking that). NOTHING could be further from the truth.
