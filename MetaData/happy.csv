She had an immediate ultrasound, and one lymph node). 

We got immediately transferred to an excellent pediatric oncology centre, none of the CT scans etc were giving a clear picture of what was going to be involved.  They couldn't do surgery for 3 weeks as they had to stabilize her, but the assumption was that it was likely advanced ovarian cancer, with the strong underlying message that we should probably be starting to think about end-of-life care. 

The surgery was the best day of my life :-)  The surgeon came racing out of the OR, and one lymph node, and he was very confident that he'd gotten it all, and that she'd be fine.  A few months of chemo, and some recovery time, and she's really never looked back. 

Now all that we have to do is have a yearly 'aftercare' checkup, there's very little chance of a recurrence.

I was admiring my flowers and remembered that Jill was back from holidays today.  Her husband quit his job and is attempting a self-employment venture and she’s been really stressed lately.  I thought that it would be nice to put a few stems on her desk.  I got one of those bathroom mouthwash sized cups and put four little blooms on her desk.  Then I thought it would be unfair not to do some for the other clerks.  I figured it would brighten their days too.  So I made them each a little nosegay and placed them on their desks.  I couldn’t leave Kathleen and Vitctoria out, just because they’re lawyers, so I gave them each 4 stems as well in the tiny cups.

Hi J

As you may have realised, I’m aware of your project work and obviously discuss with M on a regular basis.

I have to say, I’ll crack that nut, one way or another, and you’re aware I’m chasing them.

I’ll diarise a more formal face-to-face meeting between you and M and you and I (separately) in respect of an appraisal and to help guide your on-the-job learning as well as consider any concerns or interests you have and want to make known.

In the meantime, but can I suggest that you perhaps take the odd break from the excellent work you are doing in order to just lean back (or swivel around) and engage a chat about nothing and anything with M, S or J.  You’ve been here long enough now where I would encourage you to try and feel comfortable and part of the team, irrespective of how ‘new’ you may still feel inside.  You’re an active and valuable member of our staff, so do feel free to get to know the other guys that bit better and to open up, share your interests etc. M and I are always talking cars, Formula 1 or something else ‘petrol’ related…let’s find out what your interests are!  Your work so far has earned to right to ‘settle in’ a little more now I feel :)

Good job – keep it up

T.


Fuck. I feel amazing.

Edit: Okay so after many comments here; looks like this wasn't really an e-mail I should be happy about. Sorry for wasting your time.

This year, the good and the bad parts of me, when I was happy and when I was sad.  I finally let that love in, and it was like being reborn.  

I spent so many years thinking I had missed my chance.  This year, and all the beautiful things others feel. This year has been the happiest year of my life, going from my darkest saddest moments of being alone to my most precious moments of being with someone who truly embraces me and everything I am.  I hardly dared hope for anything more than just one day at a time, being happy and handling all the difficulties of life as they arose.
 
Yesterday was my 45th birthday.  My longtime friend, just at the edge of a beautiful ocean with the setting sun glinting bright on the water.  All around us were children playing and happy people flying kites...things I always felt remote from, things I always felt I missed. He gave me a big box, wrapped up like a present.  I unwrapped and unwrapped and unwrapped and finally came to a tiny box....with a ring inside. I burst into tears as he looked into my eyes and asked me to marry him, because he wanted to be with me forever.

It is not too late. It is only the beginning.  If it can happen to me, and knowing I have another day--another precious opportunity to make my life as good or bad as I want to.

__________________

Dear [stevethepirate]
 
This note contains a brief summary of your classmates' and my feedback to your class presentation. It is my hope you will find ways to use this feedback to further hone your presentation and communication skills
 
The great majority of your classmates evaluated your presentation as ""excellent""; a few classmates evaluated it as ""very good"". My evaluation of your presentation was ""excellent"" and your score on the presentation turns out to be 120/120. I very much appreciated your sense of confidence, your clear awareness you were speaking to an audience. I would dare saying you seemed a ""natural teacher"" to me (some of your classmates said that too). All the basics of an excellent presentation were there, and I was very happy to see that: it's the time I have seen you present at your best. So I don't have much to say in terms of improvements for your future presentations. Only refinements: try to project your voice a bit more towards the audience, and make sure you give the audience enough background or framework of reference so that everybody can follow your line of thought. You have clearly thought about your topic quite a bit... most of the other people had never thought or even heard of it before. Try to keep that in mind when you decide how to present a topic you researched.

Thanks for your excellent work. I hope you find this feedback useful and supportive.

I've never been able to see out of my left eye, but that's about it. 19 months ago, I had a corneal transplant (awesome picture of my eye at that point here: http://imgur.com/WEBZM) to give me a dead person's eye (well, cornea).

Yesterday, or at least until they degrade). The vision will make final improvements over the next few weeks, but immediately after taking them out and putting on some glasses - I can see! For the first time in my life, I have (mostly) clear vision out of my left eye. It's incredible, I rang my wife in tears because I actually saw what my surgeons face looked like properly for the first time (my ""good"" eye isn't great either, that's next).

It's such a crazy feeling of excitement made even more so by the fact that I haven't really told many people.  It's such an odd feeling because on the one hand, I want her to be surprised and I'm not willing to risk ruining it.  (My parents and sister know, and her parents know... that's it)

So... this is my plan.  

For years she has been dropping subtle (and not so subtle) hints that she wanted to pick up photography.  About a month ago I swapped my Dell M1330 Laptop (retired) to Itsprestonm [\(thank you r/trade\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TRADE/comments/jzl3p/wtt_nikon_d80_digital_slr_camera_with_afs_dx/) for his Nikon D80.  I've now taken a number of pictures of me holding up a dry erase board that read:

1. Hey Babe!
2. I like you!
3. A lot!
4. You make the bad days Good
5. ...and I want to spend the rest of my life...
6. Annoying the Shit out of you!
7. So....
8. (Picture of me holding the ring.)

I'm really excited and I don't think she is going to see it coming.  I told her I wanted to go out and take some pictures tonight while we still had some nice weather left (living in Michigan).  

We're going to go for a walk around the city to take pictures and then out to dinner.  I think before we go to dinner I'm going to take her to a little park/fountain area we like to relax and people watch at and tell her to check the camera and see if we got any good pictures.  When she scrolls through

Sadly the pictures didn't come out that great (I was in somewhat of a rush to get the pictures taken before she got home from work) and I have no skills with photoshop... but it's not that big of a deal.  At first I wanted to try to photoshop myself into interesting places with the signs... but realized I just don't have the required skill set.  Either way I'm really happy and wanted to share.  

Thanks for listening Reddit (or not... either way). 
__________________________________________________________

EDIT:  Thank you guys for all your support and suggestions.  Tonight was absolutely one of the greatest nights of my life and everything went EXACTLY as planned.  It literally could not have been more perfect.  The weather was beautiful and I got to propose just as the sun was setting.  She was sitting on the bench just outside the park/fountain... I gave her the camera and told her to scroll to the right... bent down to 'tie my shoe' prepped the ring and waited... she cried a little... but mostly just laughed.  

Thank you reddit... first for giving a shit... and second for letting me unload some of my excitement before actually proposing.  It was an amazing feeling to be able to share it with you guys (albeit complete strangers). 


EDIT 2:  She REALLY liked the ""Annoying the shit out of you"" picture.

This last year, just boring and a little weird. Unemployed, no school, no love life... You get it. 

Let's start from the beginning of this wonderful week, but older than me and I felt like I didn't quite fit in. Last week however, we went on a trip with the choir and it was amazing. Concerts, pub nights, boardgames... Everything just felt right, and all the people were great! I feel like I've made friends with most of them by now. 

There was choir practice Monday, and my range was proper for once. 

Tuesday, though! So now we're trying to find time for coffee some day next week. 

And the biggest thing of all: today I was informed that I've been accepted to the school of my choice! After a week of worrying over my future

Tomorrow, so I'm psyched!

Anyone who's thinking about quitting smoking and trying a PV (personal vaporizer) should head to e-cigarette-forum.com and check out [The Wonderful World of Vaping](http://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/ecf-library/) series of posts. There are lots of friendly people there that helped me immensely in making the transition from smoking to vaping.

Now that I have insurance

I’ve been leaving early for the last little while. I haven’t been eating or sleeping well for the last couple weeks. When I had my blood drawn for tests yesterday

I had an extreme panic attack yesterday and ran home. Literally, which is why I’m bringing all this up now.

I’ve been preparing for some extreme behavior by setting up ways I can work from home

Thanks for the explanation and mainly for finally making the choice to treat something that would otherwise haunt you.  There is no reason to ashamed or embarrassed at all and hope you do not feel that way.

We will support you as best we can with this transition/titration to steady medication regimen to help you function and be effective.
