For a small library in a fairly rural area, just like the comic character, and his medieval bathing habits. I'm not sure what he does in his spare time to smell like burning rubber and compost, but it must be a daily routine. Obviously I can't tell you Prince Valiant's real name, but I can tell you he's legally changed it to include the nickname of his dead girlfriend.

Prince Valiant bicycles from a slummy tenant house 6 miles away about 2-3 times a week in order to use our internet and check out literally dozens of cds. His wallet is a filthy piece of cardboard from a Coke carton

The Prince LOVES to talk to anyone he can corner-- and by talk, etc. He wanted to stay at the computer until the library shut down, convinced it was the only way to protect his account.

Yes, he's completely nonviolent. Honestly though, I'd rather have him punch me so I could A) beat him upside the head with a bookend and B) ban him for life if he survived. He's a small guy, and I have years of pent-up rage on my side.

It's not the smell

The Prince once brought in a live kitten, he reached in and produced the poor thing. It dangled from his fingers with a numb look of misery. I'm sure it died later.

I hate you

I've included a little personal background if that helps you with responding to my questions, but I'm pretty low-key and low-stress. I'm not lazy, but if I don't care my work ethic suffers in equal proportion. I have a great deal of knowledge about literature and books (partly from education and partly from work experience.) 

Anyway, some, or none. Any help is much appreciated!

1. What drew you to the librarian profession?
2. I know that some librarian jobs don't require an MLS but do require a BA. Do libraries tend never to hire people unless they have a MLS or are pursuing one? Should I just go ahead and get one right now? I was planning on getting a job at the library and then working on my MLS
3. How long did it take you to get your MLS? Did it break the bank?
4. What kind of person do you think makes a good librarian?
5. How much of your time is divided between technical research stuff and actually working with patrons and books on the floor?
6. Do you see yourself working at the library indefinitely? Is this a long-term career choice for you?
7. Do libraries care if you got your MLS online if the program is accredited? Is accreditation the only thing that matters or do they like to see certain schools or programs?
8. Do you feel overburdened or constantly stressed? Do you find yourself juggling lots of projects and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work? (This is one thing I dislike about my current job.)
9. Do you like your coworkers? The atmosphere? Do you look forward to going to work?
10. Any other advice

What elements of the program hindered your academic progress (e.g., relevance of course offerings)?

The university misrepresented its services.  I applied to and was accepted by, everything was shifted from real classroom learning, with professorial involvement, onto blackboard self-management chat.  There is no reason to pay the massive amount of money I paid for this, it is just a chat board where the professors moderate discussion, there was a serious lack of insight by the staff. There was no actual instruction!  The university basically charged me to say ""go read about what you think the industry is about, post on message boards!"" 
I truly hope the university loses its ALA accreditation.  I am incensed by how little this program cares about actually furthering...anything.  I think the SISLT program is an actual fucking scam.  I work 40 hours a week on campus, and my adviser has always avoided meeting me or giving me one, just one, piece of fucking advice.   You got my money, way to go.  

What elements of the program helped you to achieve your academic and professional goals?

Myself, and build connections through services I found outside of the university's guidance.  The only resources the university provided me, after it moved to a purely chat based ""teaching"" model was access to database and journals, so I'm sure you'll fucking cut those soon.

What services/resources would have appreciably strengthened the quality of your graduate student experience in the College of Education?

I would have loved to have had a couple of professors, and we would have all benefited if the college of education thought information specialists were something more than a cash cow. Some semblance of human interaction!  A chat room is not an education.  I hope there is another place to say ""Fuck You"" on this form, but in case there isn't: Fuck You.

Please share more about your satisfaction with your coursework and curriculum.

What coursework?  Is there even a failure rate? You literally charge us thousands of dollars to chat about what we are reading with other people who are reading the same thing.   

Have to add this on because it warms my heart:

As you complete your degree and most likely prepare to exit the College of Education

Will You Stand for Privacy?

A Message to ALA Members from ALA President Barbara Stripling

 

In early June, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, YouTube, and social networking activities have been collected and catalogued by the FBI and the NSA over the last seven years.

 

ALA is saddened by recent news that the government has obtained vast amounts of personal information and electronic communications of millions of innocent people. The extent of the personal information received by the government is very troubling. Those of you who have been long-time members of ALA know that we have always argued that provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act encroach on the privacy expectations of library users. Worse

 

When we spoke out in 2001 against the passage of the PATRIOT Act, and many legislators and privacy experts have noted that Congress would not have understood the chilling impact on privacy if librarians had not brought it to the nation’s attention. Librarians were so vocal in their opposition to the law that Section 215 was called the ""library provision."" We could not have imagined then what is happening today. Today, in spite of the leak allegations, the government continues to use the “library provision” to vacuum up private communication records of Americans on a massive scale.

 

Even the most cynical among us could not have predicted that the Obama Administration—an administration that campaigned on the promise of greater government transparency and openness—would allow a massive surveillance program to infringe upon the basic civil liberties of innocent, transparency and public accountability. Our country needs to find the right balance.

 

We need to restore the balance between individual rights and terrorism prevention

 

Next Steps: Be a Leader at Your Library

 

We are calling on librarians to facilitate local public dialogues and educational sessions on government surveillance and transparency. To help libraries convene privacy forums and moderate public conversations

 

The website contains the following resources:

 

Guide for Moderators (PDF)

This document outlines the steps and process for moderators to convene a forum on privacy in their community. Libraries are a perfect location for this form of civic engagement. Librarians may choose to serve as moderators or find other individuals in the community to fill the moderator’s role. This PDF contains the information necessary for moderators of a forum on privacy.

 

Guide for Participants (PDF)

Distribute this document to individuals participating in a library-hosted community discussion on privacy. It provides an overview of the deliberative process and outlines the privacy issues to be considered.

 

Checklist for Convening a Forum on Privacy (PDF)

This document outlines the steps needed to host a successful forum on privacy in your library.

 

Choose Privacy Week Resources

This offers videos that can be used for programming on surveillance. The site includes guest blogs from national privacy advocates and American Library Association t-shirts and posters.

 

Please do not respond to this email. If you have any questions about the privacy toolkit

Hi /r/libraries. 

I've been hired as a part time Librarian and the experience has had plenty of ups and downs. I'm in a suburb for what it's worth.

Over the years while I was getting my education

I know how to do reference and how to help patrons use the internet, but I'm talking Meta-Librarianship. The big picture. What does it mean to be a Librarian? What do you do outside of Reference? 

My problem is that I have absolutely no idea. I can't exactly order books (Thanks to P.T.) but I can make lists of books to get. I've hosted a few programs and I have gone to some community festivals to 'help make ourselves known' as it were. I've made a few reading lists of book genres too.

So aside from Reference, I can stay busy doing the day to day for... maybe two hours. Then I'm left with the remaining three to just start going batshit crazy until I get to go home. 

I usually write long

I guess I do and don't have an initiative problem. If I see that a fellow Librarian needs, I bet they would be happy if I went and got a copy for them! Our evening program needs a bigger trashcan for wrappers: I'd better go get one! The ice seems to be melted in the soda can cooler. I should restock that! 

The other Librarians (Who have all been working professionally for over 20 years) all know what to do. I dont. ""Make a display."" Of what? How? I mean

The situation I am in feels almost exactly as though I was a chef and I was in a pantry with shelves full of foods and ingredients. The Boss comes in and says: ""Okay! Now cook!"" 

Uh.. What would you like me to make Boss?

""Heck I dunno. Italian. Make Italian food."" and then the Boss leaves the room.

Well okay. Uh, lasagna, a salad, tiramisu, some meatballs, and some alfredo sauce. (I could go on but you get the idea.) And... I'm still stuck with 4 hours left in the day because I know how to cook that stuff and it just sort of comes together in this amount of time. 

I'm just extremely stressed because I learned theory in graduate school and that was about it. I have no idea how to be a Librarian outside of reference duties.

Can you help me?",,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1htpl3/new_librarian_super_stressed_wall_of_text/

I've been a bit apprehensive about posting here after seeing some other posts from an ambitious and confused few who think ""starting a library"" sounds like a great way to kill time. This isn't why I'm here.

To keep it short: I'm with a resource-limited community. When you don't have much, a leader in the community, what would happen if we could change that, he told me, ""If you build it, I will get them to read."" However ideal, that was sufficient: it's being done.

One month in

- We have a space
- We have wood to build shelves extra shelves. One wall is already complete and full (native language texts
- We have some catalog software (will return with specifics)
- We have set the donations in order to keep the book flow coming.
- We have a reading awareness campaign in the works.
- We have plans for weekly events, and more.

What I don't have is any clue how I'm going to keep this room of soon-to-be organized books -- rightly, for a refugee community, there isn't enough auxiliary cash flowing around to pay even $150/American a month to find a librarian. I don't know how libraries work with minimal resources. From my perfunctory reading, they require an incredible amount of maintenance.

That will come. I'll find a way to fund it myself if I have to. The shelves will be full. The idle ones who are interested will have books to read and some structure to develop as readers. I can promise that much. 

But anything worth building should be left with room to grow, I've left things out, considerations that need to be weighed, variables, hidden costs, library cards, late fines, baseline logical energy. Now

I come to you as an occasional lurker here

I am trying to figure out what direction to go career-wise. I bounced around a bit as an undergrad (money issues) but finally graduated with an overall 3.3 in Biology. I went to a (very good) school for a graduate program in the sciences

1. How did you decide on library sciences? What drew you to it? Did you do a specialization? Has that helped you career-wise?

2. What experience did you have prior to applying for graduate school? Anything I could do work- or volunteer-wise to make sure I'm not choosing the wrong thing?

3. Did you have any trouble getting a job in your desired field once you completed the MLIS? Has it been worth it to you?

Thanks for any advice you can give me. I appreciate any feedback!

EDIT: I just want to say thank you so much to everyone who replied. Your feedback was immensely helpful.

I've recently joined the staff of a public school here in South Africa as a teacher-librarian (Grades 1 - 7). I'm filled with enthusastic (probably over-optimistic) ideas about how to improve our library

I only have an hour every two weeks with each class. Most of that time is spent on returning and taking-out books using the manual card system. I would love to free up my time so that I can promote information literacy, as a new librarian, I'm not in a position to push for that expense. I hope to convince them of the necessity of the upgrade soon. I do not have a library assistant, student assistants (yet), or a computer with internet - I do have my tiny netbook. 

I'm reaching out to /r/Libraries with the hope that I can gain some insight into running a manual library system. How did things 'used' to go before we had barcode scanners?

However, or ""will better meet all of our immediate requirements"" which I get a month after applying and not getting an interview.

Clearly

**Here are some things about me:**

* retail experience

* library volunteer experience

* a volunteer experience at an event that required organizing books

* I did pretty well on a cataloging test; or is perfect the only option?

* My schedule is completely free

* I like helping people find books and other materials

**Some potential problems:**

* I have a bachelor's in something not library related. Should I remove my education information from my resume? Is *this* what's messing up my qualifications?

* Have I been blackballed in the whole system after an interview with one branch that went well but apparently wasn't good enough to get me hired? Because I haven't gotten an interview since that went down.

* Should I *not* continue to list my 100 WPM and my ability to use Ubuntu?

* In the desired wage portion of the application

People I see in this position at most libraries seem to be students or middle-aged women. Do I need to be on financial aid or food stamps or unemployment for someone to take my job hunt seriously?

I live in a metropolitan that has new branches popping up about once per year, it seems like libraries that are a 1-2 hour drive away are hiring more often than this city is in a month, so I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to branch out (ha. ha.) into more rural towns.

Secondly, too (a growing niche, not a old-guard niche).


I got this idea because recently our library director found some extra money in the budget for a new position and we decided to make some pretty odd exceptions to get strong candidate that made a good impression on the director in the past. It was one of those

Every child in America deserves access to an effective school library program. We ask that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provide dedicated funding to help support effective school library programs. Such action will ensure more students have access to the resources and tools that constitute a 21st century learning environment. Reductions in school library programs are creating an ‘access gap’ between schools in wealthier communities versus those where there are high levels of poverty. All students should have an equal opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to learn

A lady came in today. She had lost her library card and our charge to replace the lost card is $1. I said ""Ok, and then she sighs exasperatedly and says to her kids ""Come on, I'm NOT paying a dollar."" and storms out. 

Ignoring the fact that I don't believe anyone goes out in the world without a SINGLE DOLLAR on them (we take cash, in which case everything's free? It seems like somehow I'm giving bad customer service, like I'm supposed to apologize for enforcing policy, and yet it's so frustrating that people think the costs associated with service don't apply to them, especially when related to libraries. Does this work with any other service? Do you go to McDonald's and say ""I want a hamburger."" and they say ""It's $1."" And you say ""I don't have $1."" And they say ""Oh, never mind then, here's your free burger.""?

I get the idea that there should be room for flexibility and mercy, and have definitely made exceptions for charity in the past. But there is also a conversation that happens before, where they express their hardship and desire for an exception to be made, and I consider the situation and decide what is reasonable, and usually that's for people who really are in a bind. People who have somehow managed to rack up a large amount of fees and will probably never be able to pay them off, or ever come back to the library because of the fees against them. In those cases, options like volunteering to work off fees can be negotiated to keep it fair and reasonable. I just don't really consider $1 for a lost card to fall into the 'charity' category.

I suppose you can argue that the policy to charge $1 to replace a lost card is frivolous, or registration fees, or out of city fees. There is an expectation that because Libraries provide a low-cost information sharing service to the public, somehow everyone's entitled to free everything. Never mind that libraries are paid for by taxpayers so they're not really 'free', and that when entrusted with taxpayer money, the best thing I can do is be a good steward of it and only give away for free that which is actually supposed to be covered by those funds.

I hear a lot of talk from older generations about how 'entitled' this generation is. How entitled millennials are for expecting things like debt-free educations and jobs with a livable wage. But let me tell you

So that was my frustration for today. That somehow I provided bad customer service by not leaping to waive her $1 charge. What do you think?",,t5_2qidr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/1hkwdg/exasperation_over_1_bad_customer_service_or/

[Database of Award-Winning Children's Literature](http://www.dawcl.com) is wonderful when someone needs a book that won such-and-such an award. When it's a kid I can narrow it down by age level and genre to try and find something they'd like.

[Fantastic Fiction](http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk). There's always a patron who wants the next book in a series but can't remember the title. This site allows you to search by title and author. On the author's page you can view all the series and the order they go in as well as recommendations by the author.

[Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) I use this site to keep track of what I've read and what I thought of it. There's listopia where users can vote for their favorite children's book of all time or most anticipated 2013 release. I've added a few of my regular patrons as friends on here to keep up with what they're reading and to share with them my latest book.

[AR BookFinder](http://www.arbookfind.com) I cannot stand AR. I always get the procrastinating kid looking for a lower grade level book that will net them 15 points and they need to read it by tomorrow. (Ok, and see what comes up.

I recently started an online MLIS program.  I really enjoy it--I imagine most people who want to be librarians enjoy school!--and it's multiplied my desire to get a job in the field of information science.
However, and I'm increasingly feeling like I'm paying for improved job prospects rather than an education.  The things I'm learning seem like things I could pursue on my own time with little outlay, and that I would learn more actually working in the field if, somehow, I could get involved in it without this degree.

Plus

So: how possible is it to get started in this field without an MLIS?  Can I take on volunteer work or internships to bolster my chances?  Does working as a library page or similar low-skill job help?  I've joined ASIS&amp;T and SAA; can I stay involved and hopefully make contacts without being in school or having a library job?

I graduated in May with my MLIS and I am now working at four different libraries because I can't find just one full time job.  I am big on networking and meeting people so when something does come up I may have a connection.

I'm starting to run into problems with too much work though.  I think I am fairly well known in the area as a recent grad and someone who has big aspirations and knows what they are doing.

I am working as a teen librarian @ 20 hours.  Adult librarian @20 hours.  Youth librarian @ 8 hours and I just got hired today at another library as a sub.  I accepted the job that I got today because it is an amazing library that I have been wanting to work at for a while.  I am working about 50 hours a week which is amazing and I love what I do!  The adult librarian position also won't stay at 20 hours.

My big questions is where do I go from here?  There are no full time positions at any of these four places and I think just doing my job well isn't enough to set me apart from my competition.  How do you set yourself apart from the competition?  I already don't have a traditional librarian background I have my BS in Management and Minor in Marketing which I made that decision when I knew I wanted to be a librarian I thought it would give me a leg up on my competition. 

I think maybe getting involved on a regional and national level might be my next move.  I am already a member of ALA and MLA (Michigan).

Unfortunately, she had major beef with the *other* person I admired most in the library, and just forced her rival out, not but a few months shy of her planned retirement. They even tried to force her out without her retirement benefits, accrued over decades of work in that same library... that's some cold fucking shit right there. (She managed to get them back

So it turns out that all this time, angry at each other, and either trying to figure out how to get out or fearing that they'd be pushed out. 

I mean

I don't know what to think anymore. I suppose I'm grateful that, it was never anything to do with me, and even now I think that I was well-liked. Certainly I genuinely liked most everyone there. But now I just don't know anymore. It turns out the place I spent the last two years was nothing at all like the place I thought it was, so who knows what else I'm wrong about?

Have you been through something like this? Is this a common thing? Are there red flags that you look for to tell whether a workplace suffers from toxic office politics? 

I'm feeling so fucking disillusioned. This sucks.

Late update: Just to wanted to say thanks to all of you for the kind words and advice. It's funny, but this one really took me by surprise. I think it worried me especially because I *just* (as in day before yesterday) moved across country to start looking for a job in a new city (can't be any worse than any of the other strategies I've seen employed), and I'm pretty unnerved by how oblivious I apparently was.

The library I work at runs this program once a month called Library After Dark. It's on Friday evenings after the library shuts down. They hold the program in the café area and sell wine, etc. There are themes to each program and the most recent was Downton Abbey. There was Downton Abbey trivia with Downton-themed prizes, a photo booth with props, word games, an online test you could take to see which character you would be, etc.

There was a good turnout (mostly a much older demographic) and the program got great feedback.

The library is thinking of making one of the upcoming months a Game of Thrones theme. While the last program had good feedback, etc. (which is what we want people to be doing at these events)
Any ideas on activities or ways to get people more excited/make the program feel more lively? Or to draw in more people from other age groups? Or any specific Game of Thrones ideas to incorporate in this program? We'll be doing the photo booth/props again since that was a huge hit last time.

**The eBook User’s Bill of Rights**

Every eBook user should have the following rights:

* the right to use eBooks under guidelines that favor access over proprietary limitations
* the right to access eBooks on any technological platform
* the right to annotate, and share eBook content within the spirit of fair use and copyright
* the right of the first-sale doctrine extended to digital content, share, and re-sell purchased eBooks

I believe in the free market of information and ideas.

I believe that authors, writers, and publishers can thrive when readers are given the maximum amount of freedom to access, annotate, and share with other readers, helping this content find new audiences and markets. I believe that eBook purchasers should enjoy the rights of the first-sale doctrine because eBooks are part of the greater cultural cornerstone of literacy, education

Digital Rights Management (DRM), literature, and information. Likewise, the current licensing arrangements mean that readers never possess ultimate control over their own personal reading material. These are not acceptable conditions for eBooks.

I am a reader. As a customer

I am concerned about the future of access to literature and information in eBooks.  I ask readers, retailers, librarians, software developers, and device manufacturers to support these eBook users’ rights. 

These rights are yours.  Now it is your turn to take a stand.  To help spread the word, remix it, and distribute it to others.  Blog it, Tweet it (#ebookrights), Facebook it, email it, and post it on a telephone pole.

I love the job. But there's one thing about the library's procedures that positively drives me up the wall and I can't decide whether I should bring it up or not. 

Like most academic institutions, they're going to be miles apart on the shelves, and the latter will come first. Because 39 is a significantly smaller number than 3879. In short, they (*sigh* we...) treat that last set of digits as whole numbers instead of as decimal points. 

Because of the way LCSH works

In addition, including searching for books at random and seeing if they're on the shelves. If these people know anything about LCSH and how the books should be arranged, that could be bad. 

Do I say something? Would that be overstepping my bounds, how do I approach it?

This is what I have in tems of food:

1)  Pizza
2)  2am sundae bar
3)  Qdoba is donating tacos
4)  Popcorn
5)  Pop

For activities I will have the following:

1)  Board games
2)  Capture the flag
3)  Video games on 3 small TVs
4)  Movie(s) on the big projector
5)  Origami/craft area
6)  Nail painting...I have a ton of new nailpolish that are funky colors that I don't really plan on using so I figured I could bring them for the girls (or guys!)
7)  Computer access with internet and Steam
8)  Music

Right now it is me and one other librarian staying the whole night.  I have my friend who is a teen librarian at a different library and her fiance coming for 2-3 hours for initial help.
