It truly began when Star Trek decided to ask the tough questions about society and how humanity could better itself through technology, when Star Trek debuted, scifi was Lost in Space, campy space fantasy.  Trek asked us what it meant to be human.  It made us question prejudices and explore not so much the final frontier, but ourselves.  Fringe is, I believe, one of the few shows that honors this powerful legacy.  It continues the theme of asking us who we are and ""what if.""  How far would you go to save your son?  Would you risk destroying the world?  When do we let science thrive and when do we place ethical limits on it?  How can our actions today affect another time or place?  And what makes us who we are, or our experiences?  How far would you go to stop yourself from becoming the thing you hate? These questions and more were asked on Fringe
When I saw the pilot episode, I was looking for a replacement for Lost, and Fringe seemed like a logical choice.  The first few episodes were great, but the show still needed room to grow.  After season two, it was my favorite show in years, surpassing Lost.  Where Lost focused on the mystery, and keeping the answers on a perpetual carrot-on-a-stick, even if they weren't what they seemed at first.  
The characters on Fringe are special.  Olivia was so great.  She oozed professionalism and curiosity.  She was intelligent and determined.  Astrid, is the best television character in a decade.  I put him up against any other notable character.  He was consistently entertaining and a genuine pleasure to watch grow and develop as a person.  He is, by far, the best example of a ""mad scientist"" on television.  
When I started /r/Fringe I had no idea what it would turn into.  In the early days, it is still the friendliest subreddit I moderate, even counting /r/fantasy.  In 4 years I've only banned 5 accounts, most of which were just novelty accounts.  The discussions have been awesome, and I've loved speculating and debating all of you.  You guys have been the source of so much great reading and discussions, I would like to personally thank all of you for being a part of this with me.  
To my other mods
This is not goodbye!  We're not going anywhere.  We will be here to discuss whatever you want about Fringe.  We will continue to have discussions and share our ideas, so please stay subscribed.  Thanks again to all of you, this have been a great ride.  Thanks to the cast and crew of Fringe for making such a great show for us to enjoy these past few years.  
Stay Observant

Watch it on [NBC.com](http://www.nbc.com/community) so that they can track its viewership.

SO MUCH of this episode is relevant to The End of All Things - particularly how time travel works.  Every time Peck goes back in time

I posit that the Observers' time travel tech must work similarly. A) Whenever Peck goes back, nobody on the train has died, the Fringe team isn't investigating a case anymore, and nobody has any memory of Peck being anything more than someone who died in a car accident with his fiancee. (Though why nobody noticed he's now a cyborg I donno).

She will be the only one to remember the events that happend in season 5. Just like when she got the memories of a life with Peter which she didn't have. 
But ofcourse she may not tell this so anyone.

 

You can see it

Credits to Baelorn:
In the scene at the park, when no Observers show up, she looks at them and smiles.

Thanks for reading and have a nice one.


Edit: I understand that the times when he shushed her were times if she kept talking she would have interfered with the way Michael intended things to go. 

But I think the time Michael shushed Olivia after she used her cortexiphan powers ment a bit more

I'd always seen people talk about fringe on forums and always say great things about this series. Although the show looked good to me I thought it was just another one of those CSI type shows so I never really checked it out. A few weeks after the Season 5 finale my friend wouldn't stop talking about the show and kept telling me to watch it he even challenged me to not cry when I got to the end of the show. I honestly didn't believe that a show which looked quite average to me could bring tears out of anyone at all. I had just finished catching up on Adventure time and re-watching Dragon Ball Z so I thought why the hell not watch at least the first season.

So I spent my weekends watching the first season of fringe. At first I thought the show was okay as it was pretty much what I had thought it would be. It was a CSI type show, something which I don't usually do. And after all this time watching Fringe I finally finished Season 5 last night and as you all know it was excellent. And yes I lost my friends challenge, I cried many man tears.

The only shows before fringe that have ever gotten me to invest so much love into the characters has been Supernatural

I know this topic was rather pointless but I just needed to express my feelings on the show and I thought this was the best place to do it. 

I just love Fringe!

Remember throughout season 1, but to the Observers themselves.  I always wondered this since in the end of the season 2 episode ""Fracture"", the ex-military terrorist dude pointed out that the Observers have been planning for ""war"".

It's a stretch too, they may be passing theirs onto us to see how we would perform using them.  An experiment, per se, only the whole world is a lab.  Thus why the Observers appear during every major event, because they wanted the course of events to happen in a very specific way, and they were there to make sure it happens, but they may have instigated it somehow.

As an example, they do utilize some qualitative elements which enhance the overall navagation and functionality of the subreddit.

For example:
Different ""types"" of spoiler tags - 
While their subreddit uses them to differentiate between book/tv/speculation spoilers

Episode Spoilers - applying to all new episodes, et al. 

Theory Spoliers - applying to all theories and speculation of what is to come.

Just a small example of maybe adding a little zap to the subreddit in honor of the conclusion of one of the best science fiction shows to be made.

Suppose there is a timeline where there was only a Blueverse. In it Walter, Peter, Broyles, and whoever else all existed. The Pattern never occurred; so there wasn't a Fringe Division. Peter might have lived or died as a child; it doesn't really matter. Walter never broke the universe; he and Bell went on to do all sorts of cool things at Massive Dynamic.

Six hundred years later, one part of the plan is: it involves creating a parallel universe.

So Walter goes about his task and creates the Redverse at some point in early history. The Observers/Invaders, the Walter of the Blueverse becomes aware of this second universe and thus does all the things we have seen since Fringe started.

The Observers may not even be aware of who created the Redverse and what its purpose is. They know it exists, who make adjustments.

1335077994.0,smdsp,Last night's episode made September actually make sense. What a CLEVER way to make his story arc awesome! [SPOILERS!],alexisaacs,84,12,74,"So it's clear now that hundreds of thousands of Observers have been existing throughout time to make sure events happen a certain way

September was the Observer initially tasked with the arbitrary mission of making sure Walternate does not see the that he found the cure to save Peter in Redverse. Just another typical task a common Observer would do.

This triggers a series of events wherein Walter goes into Redverse, thus ensuring that no Peter from either universe would impede the Observer plans in 2015, or what have you. 

September, which upsets the other Observers. He is punished, and is tasked (with a few team members) to restore the time line and eliminate Peter. September reluctantly agrees, and they succeed in influencing the universe to ensure Peter's demise.

Except Peter return to the world, then returns to the past to explain things to Peter. He realizes that the only way to stop the invasion is to make sure Peter and Olivia have the ""right"" child, so he tells Peter information that allows for this to happen.

Then

**Except for one huge plot hole.** If the Observers exist outside of space-time, how are they not omniscient? Why didn't they simply kill September, go back in time, and have another agent do September's job properly?

How did the Observer in tonight's episode get killed by the anti-matter bomb? Via the show's own premise

1337136813.0,tpc6n,Theory on why the two different types of Observers exist.,wicked_pissah,85,13,35,"So

So re-watching the scene where Peter and Olivia get attacked by the Observers, less skilled, not emotionless, and aggressive.  And then at the end of the episode, September calls his buddies and tells them that Walter let the boy go, despite his warning to him.

Anyway, there was never any Henrietta Bishop/Dunham because Peter was cured on the red-universe side and never traveled to our universe to meet our Olivia.  So the Observers came from the future and took over in 2015 and ruled...forever or something.  This is the future I thought September might be from.  The Observers from 2036 didn't have any superhuman abilities and we didn't see any crazy technology, so where did September and his team get theirs?  I'm guessing that they're from the future of an earth that was invaded by men from the future.

So maybe the Science team went back and is just genuinely curious about the past or need to know how something happened so that they can do it too.  I'm not really sure what their real purpose is.  

But anyway

I think September saw a future where the invading force from the future had been conquered in 2036-2037 or so.  September may have even seen himself--a smiling, and I think he maybe saw himself in love with someone and wanted that desperately).  And he saw that the world was capable of being a far, far better place than the world that he found himself coming from.

So

1.  He pulled Walter and Peter out of the frozen Reiden Lake
2.  He told Walter that he had to raise Peter
3.  He didn't erase Peter from the new timeline that would have kept Henrietta from being born.
4.  He told Peter that Olivia was his Olivia

Every interaction he has had since that moment has been in the efforts of preserving that timeline where he saw the better future than the history he knew.

Thoughts?  I'm about to crash

BTW, smiling.

EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies.  After posting this last night, September comes from the very original timeline--the one where blue Peter died and red Peter lived, but stayed on the other side.  The invaders from the future come to 2015 and rule with an iron fist for centuries.  Sometime around this 2600 timeframe, September arrives on the scene.  Human history for the last 600 years was one of oppression, where having stray thoughts against the Observers could get you killed.  Feelings are dangerous, free thought is pretty much illegal.  So humans adapted to essentially not have emotions, and that's where September's from--a future where emotions are fully evolved out of the human race because emotions became a liability to the species.

EDIT2:  Upon further reflection

**TL;DR: September and the Science Team are from the future of the earth where the 2015 invasion happened and Etta Bishop didn't exist,False,,t5_2qii0,1337191968.0,,,t3_tpc6n

First of all

What really got to me were thing like:

Things like why Olivia only used her ""powers"" when it was convenient not when it was logical? 

Why didn't she just go to the room the boy observer was and just jump there instead of having to battle to get to him? 

Why did the observers leave Fauxlivias universe alone? What made Olivia's universe so special? Was it just that specific time line they existed in? 

I've mentioned this before but how did Peter at least not remember Olivia from his childhood? Yes

Someone mentioned in another post of why didn't the observer that went to the future to get the piece for the machine just take the boy to the time they were trying to get him to? I get that he was being tracked but was he aware of it? It's something they should of addressed.

And I'm not gonna get into the time travel issues because those are just gonna happen when you are dealing with time travel. 

Any insight to these things would be awesome. Thanks!

Since I joined this subreddit a few months ago, who have likewise, shared your own. Although it would be cliche of me to state that I feel like we're one big family - I cannot deny that I, like Lincoln on the Other Side, feel strangely at home here. 

If you don't mind

Ever since season 2

I enjoyed spotting everything from the little quirks that our character's dopplegangers possessed

But the longer I spent there

The episode in season 3, who had just given birth, limp in his arms. To this day, that scene fills me with sadness. In those few seconds, I was overcome by such immense emotion, that I was instantly connected to both him and her and the whole Other Side. When Lincoln confessed his love for her in a murmured tone, a tear rolled down my face. I didn't know it then

The Alternate Universe became a constant in the Fringe Universe. Much like a loved one

Much like a loved one

It is often said that you never know what you've got until it's gone. Today was as good of an example as any. I really miss them. As the machine was working

Today I mourn the loss of the Other Side. The World Just Like Ours, unknowing of what the future holds for all of us.

Lets hope it has rainbows.

This led me to discover a related concept in physics: [the Observer effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics\))

This concept **""refers to changes that the act of observation will make on the phenomenon being observed.""**

Sound familiar?

But this part really blew my mind:

&gt; The many-worlds interpretation posits the existence of multiple universes in which an observed system displays all possible states to all possible observers. In this model, and in others the observer would observe a different result from a different state of the system.

1357836756.0,16bkl3,"A few thoughts on Walter, Peter, and God",AngrySpock,57,24, but if it did

Walter playing God has been a major theme throughout the series.  We know that 1985 Walter was ruthlessly driven to expand his knowledge and that he was dismissive of any sort of limitation of that goal, or religious.  Recently, in flashbacks, we've heard his old lab assistant Carla warn him about playing God and, memorably, he tells her ""There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours.""

Then we have Peter, while born out of love, would ultimately destroy both Universes if left unchecked.

So Peter sacrifices himself.  He saves the world(s) and

But he comes back.  This ""resurrection"" is achieved not through a definable or calculable scientific feat

I think it would fitting with these themes if, he becomes God.  But not the God he envisioned himself to be as a younger man.  This is God as a humble old man, a man terrified of losing himself in ambition and hubris, who can barely remember his phone number but knows he loves candy.

I also have a hunch that the Science Team of which September is a part is actually quite separate from the Observer invaders and have been working to aid us from the beginning.  There also happen to be twelve of them.  One might think of them as disciples.

Anyway, it is an interesting lens through which to view the show's story.",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,

In the uninterrupted timeline, saving Peter's life. No war occurs between universes, and the Observers evolve from humanity on our side without interruption. However, the Observer science team have an innate ability to tell when someone is ""important"". Peter is one of these people, and September appears in the lab to observe, interrupting Walternate. September has ""an opportunity to fix this"", and dives in with his anti-freeze enhanced blood to save Peter.

Why was Peter identified as important in the first place? If they knew Peter would end up being part of the resistance that will eventually eradicate them, or they know that in their examination of billions of possible futures, particular individuals keep popping up as playing an integral part in history.

Once September saves him, and Peter's purpose in this timeline is to step into the machine to fix the problem. After all, it's the Observers' job to watch over timelines, and they can't simply leave this new-found time loop (build the machine, destroy the other side, send the machine back, repeat) without a conclusion. Peter's entry into the machine and making a different choice solves this timeline and seals it. The machine itself is a paradox

However, from this point, the fate of the worlds is to be *joined* rather than destroyed. In the Red universe, before the timelines become intertwined, September still interrupts the search for cure, causing Walter to cross over. However, after the crack occurs, and *not* the Amber universe (""Blue joins with Red"" timeline). Thus

The Observers have calculated that this will be the outcome - ""you were right, deem that this outcome is acceptable, knowing that this version of the timeline satisfactorily resolves the timeline enough that order is restored, and that the Observers will still evolve. It also allows them to remove baby Henry, ""born to the wrong Olivia"" and who would have ""irrevocably altered everything"".

With Peter continuing to fluctuate in and out of the Amberverse, as he has come to know and feel a connection to the past and the people in it, and makes the decision to go against the science team, allowing Peter to return. He must know that Peter's continued existence will be a threat to the timeline and potentially the future of the Observers but, as we find out by the end of season 4, it appears that he has decided to work against them, even at the cost of his own existence.

This also suggests that Peter is unlikely to be the first Observer. If the Observers knew that Peter was the progenitor of their species in any of the timelines, only September has done everything to save Peter, ultimately going so far as to assist Walter in creating a machine to eliminate the Observers. If the now sympathetic September knew that Peter would be the first Observer, he could simply have thrown the switch on his erasure device and that would have sealed their fate there and then: no need to wait for the invasion to occur.",,False,,1352220199.0,t3_12q629

She is the one

So when Henry was born to Fauxlivia

1. Redverse Peter is cured by Walternate. (September didn't interrupt Walter


2. At some point Redverse Peter and Blueverse Olivia meet after Olivia crosses over or something.


3. Peter and Olivia have Henry. (henry was supposed to born to blue/original Olivia and red universe peter . If Henry was born to them, then he would also have that ability and might be the next evolved human that maybe the observers originated from?)

I was able to snag a couple shots before they asked me to put the camera away but i can give a visual description of what i saw. 

Description:
[The scene was set outside the Alternative Universe Fringe division building with logos and everything that appears. set up with NYC taxi's out in front covered in dirt and broken up. Other dirty and busted hybrid cars all over the street. No signs of any observers or anything related to them there. Anna Torv (as normal olivia from our universe) was there filming some shots

Only able to snap 2 pics but they are high enough res to see what is going on

This is more an observation than an actual theory

Colours have always been a focus of the Fringe universe. Specifically the colours of each universe. I'm starting to notice that the episodes themselves have only 5 colours.

If you take white and black out of the equation (not actually colours), in the devices being used etc.

Brown, Blue and Green. In everything. Never more. Never purple, never pink, never anything but those colours. Going back through the episodes of this season and even further, the Fringe team always wears a combination of only those colours. Walter's overcoat is greenish-brown. The human collaborators wear green jackets with red and yellow on them, and brown undershirts. 

Only ever seeing green foliage and no real flowers. 

Everything follows those colours. And different seasons have different tints to those colours. Season 4 was brighter, or out of place characters. 

And the opening sequence for the shows has followed a similar pattern (also denoting different universes). Red

Clearly colours are important. What I don't know (outside the colours denoting different universes) is why? Any theories? ",,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/11kthi/observation_about_fringe_and_the_new_season/

It could explain his tendency to ignore his orders and to help the people who helped him when he was a child.

I was explaining a few things to her without getting into spoilers and in ep 4 when we see September eating the roast beef sandwich I started explaining a bit about the Observers and their roles.  It just suddenly struck me that he acts different than he's supposed to and there must be a reason for it.

About 50 minutes in

Shortly after that

Could the anti-matter baton been much more effective than  it originally looked?  The new wormhole could have come from 10, or not removed in a timely fashion.

Either that
