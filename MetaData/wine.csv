I have a new series coming online called Brown Bag Wine Tasting.  While I love a good glass of wine the rating numbers and high brow ""five dollar"" type words used to describe wine I think make the ordinary person afraid of talking about and enjoying the pleasures of wine. 

What I've done is take a bottle of wine wrapped in a brown bag so I don't know what it is or what it has been rated and go out to the person on the street and together we do some wine tasting and instead of talking about aroma, etc... I have them describe the wine in the vernacular of their own occupations.

For example a butcher may describe a good wine's body as ""filet mignon"" or ""top round"" while a bad wine as ""rump roast"" or ""processed meat"".  

It's fun

I'd love to share the webisodes with you on this subreddit.  

May I?

First, take the other bottle and wrap it up with a brown bag, foil, or something that completely conceals the body and label. Then label it by number. 

Once everyone is there and the bottles are labeled, by a point system. (We used numbers 1-5, 5 being highest) You'll need to provide a score sheet. We made our own. 

Depending on how many guests you have, cheeses, fruits, charcuterie, bread, ect to help the buzz and palette. 

After all the wines have been tasted

Best. Game. Ever. 

Some advice: You can play with the rules for your specific party. For example

We had an all cabernet wine war, and voted himself up, winning by 2 points. In all fairness, he copped to it :) 

I hope this sounds like fun to my fellow wine lovers! If you think of any ideas to improve or improvise the game please post em!

I would not consider myself a wine expert. One day I hope to know much much more than I currently know. I have been through thte entire WSET program, but your notes will make it obvious one the asshole who put the food coloring in the wine shows you the bottle. 

Again, I had a strong feelings that we were judging the under $12 category wines. We were told the variety but nothing about price, quality or region. Many of the wines tasted similar and they tasted cheap. The fruit was simple, the tannins rough, the wines lacked complexity and the oak was not integrated. While many around me felt the need to find wines that had to be of grater quality, I stuck to the system I learned. When we were allowed to go into a room and view all the flights, low and behold

My point is not that I am a bad ass taster..I could not have told you exactly where all these wines were from (through an educated guess of California would have taken care of th majority) and I would have had a hard time telling thte difference between quite a few of the varieties at this price point had we not been told that ahead of time. Point is, Caymus SS for example) because they taste more like a $35 wine than it does a $135 wine.

And what did that ""bullshit"" article say about not being able to process or taste more that 4 or so tastes in a wine? Really? Plum, vanilla, mineral, mint, cedar, eucalyptus. How many of you can find those relatively easily in a barossa Shiraz? Ok, I might be pushing it with the mineral in a typical barossa.

If you taste what is in the glass. You would know that there was something wrong with that Grand Cru bottle that was filled with VdP wine or you would say ""this is one helluva VdP

Typing is this small box makes it difficult to gauge how much I have written and I feel I have possible gone on too long. Let me end on this...it is possible to objectively taste wine. It is possible to decide upon a quality level and price range by tasting the wine. Is also possible to deduce many things about how the wine was produced and the method used by tasting the wine. It is also possible to make

So, insist that these expert tasters demonstrate that they know how to taste and can write notes that tell you something about the wine, not just try to come up with the most gushing, poetic crap at they can. Make the notes a bit more boring and scientific, in a sense. What kind of fruit? Just say that it is red or black and that it's ripe or unripe. This means more than listing exotic fruits and flavors. 

Is it just me or does anyone else feel this way?

I'm not sure what my end game is. I would love to make wine for a living but I know getting there is going to be hard.  
What the fuck am I doing? am  I doing the right thing? you fuckers need to help me.  

**Edit:**Sorry for the short paragraph but I've been tasting at work.  

I've been in the distro side of the business for 5 years and I'm getting the call from the wild. We're getting rid of everything!so we don't have any idea where we are going or what we are doing when we come back. There has been talk of perhaps trying to hit australia or NZ for their harvest but we can't afford to get there.  
THE FUN PART: I'm not sure we will have enough money...but the plane tickets are already paid for.   
Last but not least I could potentially try to go to UC davis but we still have my wife's loans and I'm scared of talking out more loans.  
**Edit2** sorry if my responses have been short. I can only reddit from my phone right now.

The moral of the story is I think I'm jumping of the ledge and I hope something catches me.

I've tasted a handful of Brunellos at trade shows and in a work environment before

I decided to splurge last night and broaden my horizons a bit. I was assured that the [2004 Tenuta Vitanza Brunello di Montalcino](http://i.imgur.com/SjLMC.jpg) ($70USD) was firmly in it's drinking window and thought I would give it a shot. Knowing it was a wine that demanded a hearty meal, lemon, olive oil, and shaved pecorino toscana. (That salad, btw, is simply divine - give it a try sometime.) 

I opened the bottle while I was cooking and poured a little bit into my glass without decanting. Dark reddish with brown tints, and decanted the wine back into the bottle. It started showing some crushed red berries and leather and the same earthy notes. Still seemed somewhat muted, confirming what I expected to be a big, brooding sort of wine. When I prepped the salad, I tried a little bit of cheese with the wine. Thats when the wine stood up and said hello. The sweetness of red fruit jumped right out, and the wine softened dramatically.

We drank the bottle with the meal, from the fatty steak to the earthy potatoes to the delicate, lemony watercress. This was not a brooding wine at all, it just needed the right company. With the meal, it was, above all, graceful and elegant. Based on my previous experiences tasting Brunello in a professional setting,"" but in a home setting I could definitely see the kinship between this and some better examples of Chianti Classico Riserva - red berries, though more earthy notes - loam and mushroom - than is usually present on Chianti.  

Would I buy it again? If I won the lottery, so $42 is a little easier than $70) and am in the mood. It won't be often, for sure, but I'm glad I got to have the experience last night. 

Any experiences with Brunello di Montalcino you care to share? Any experiences about the changing nature of wine when paired with the right food you care to add?

Who am I to teach?  That’s a good question.  I have 2 years retail experience, everyone!  You’ve probably read some ridiculous description somewhere, at some time in your life.  If they’re not afraid to speak their ridiculous mind, then you shouldn’t be, too.

So

If you’ve ever read a description of wine it mentions foods, etc, and if you’ve not been around enough, you might as well just throw it all out the window.  What I’m hoping to do in this is explore the 5 senses as you drink, and let you know what people mean when they say they can detect “a hint of grapefruit,” or a “nose of pencil shavings.”

I’m going to post sub comments about the different senses and how they pertain to tasting a wine.  This is from the perspective of someone analysing a wine in order to write a note or review,False,self,t5_2qhs8,1346005330.0,,,t3_yv0fz

This time

[HERE'S THE ALBUM


* deviled soft-boiled egg with dill

       Paired with *2011 Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc Cellar Reserve* - Admittedly, Grapefruit, Grass, and a touch of Jalapeno.  A little more restrained and elegant than the base level Villa Maria, which I sometimes find to be wayyy over-extracted.  The hint of sriracha on the egg made this first pairing a knockout.  

* buckwheat crepe with ramp confit

    Also paired with the Villa Maria.  I wasn't quite expecting this dish to be so focused on the balsamic

* asparagus soup with crispy tips and croutons

    paired with *2011 Stadt Keller Krems Gruner Veltliner* - Huge florals on the nose and palate


* chicken liver mousse with sweet-pickled rhubarb

    paired with *2006 Kreydenweiss Moenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris*  - Golden, sweet stone fruits and yellow apples.  It felt like it was just beginning to take on a syruppy quality, yet was completely dry on the palate.  The acidity was muted, the finish incredibly long. This pairing was remarkable, and was one that stick with me for a long time.

* lake huron trout in parchment with morels
    
    paired with *2010 Trombetta Family Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast*  I was way more interested in pairing with the morels than I was the trout, vanilla, creamy black cherries, and a spritz of minerality.  Juicy on the mid-palate, with a light touch of tannin.  Another crowd pleaser, although given another opportunity, I would've gone for Burgundy.

* lamb meatballs with herb choux gnocchi and mustard sauce
    
    paired with *1998 Pertinace Barbaresco Vigneto Castellizzano*  After decanting for an hour and a half, it was still dark garnet in color, with very little browning around the rim.  Ripe cherries, red licorice, sprinkles of wet earth, and just a touch of tar.  It was deep, but not one of those revelatory moments I've had with Nebbiolo before.

* fried purple haze goat cheese with wild watercress and honey

    the star of the night, very much like a Fino sherry.  On the palate, incredibly complex, and constantly changing.  Mashed apples, lemon, herbs, almonds, all with a waxy texture and an impressive amount of fresh acidity.  Paired with fried goat cheese and honey?  Holy mother..

* strawberry pavlova with pistachios  Paired with an after dinner nap

I'm of the belief that it is appropriate. They could have brought it due to financial constraints, and I made sure it was opened and served alongside everything else that evening ... as to not be rude.

These three came out - we only had a sodium light on and the blinds drawn so it was nearly impossible to ascertain any hues of colour etc. He asked us to throw out a few descriptors and then how much we would pay for the bottle (done auction style - so highest bidder).

1) Oxydised, Bitter. The majority would not buy. One person had an idea what it could be and said €15.

2) Brett, Earthy. Would pay €3.

3) Menthol, Vanilla, Animal. Would pay €25. I personally found the wine to be clean, of a medium intensity with a decent volume in the mouth but rather coarse tannins which lead to a slightly chalky finish. Decent length but nothing astonishing - would say I've drunk wines around €15 of a similar quality.


So the grand unveiling:

1) Tio Pepe: Fino sherry. So here obviously we'd all been expecting a white wine and found this oxydised

2) Cos Estournel 1984. Actual price ~ €49. To be fair

3) This is where it gets interesting... Château Angelus 2004. Actual price ~ €190. 

This is a room full of trainee winemakers here! Bordeaux, Angelus is reputed to be one of the great wines of the world. Unless they're being seriously fascetious, there are few who would say it is not a very good wine and I think most of us would pay handsomely (if not the asking price) to taste it. This left me in an almost existential crisis! If a room full of winemakers can not taste quality then how could a consumer? What is quality if it can only be judged when attached to a label? I realise that this phenomenon is quite well documented but I always slightly ignored it and though it couldn't be quite true but whoa!

Time to start drinking the top out of your wine cellar. ,sdeutsch,38,5,13,"The best thing about the Mayan apocalypse is that there is no point in preparing for it. This is the lazy man’s Y2K. For those too young to remember, but at the time people were terrified to the point of hoarding canned food.

In the case of the Mayan apocalypse, your stockpile of MREs and ammunition will do you no good. If the Earth is doomed, consuming is the smart move. To that end, we’ve been drinking the top end out of our wine cellar.

If you needed an excuse

We have read the NASA press release stating that there is no evidence of a pending apocalypse. We do give weight to their analysis since they are the same people who landed a rover the size of a Toyota pickup truck on the surface of the planet Mars. They do know a little about science.

On the other hand, this bottle is not currently available for sale anywhere in the world. We therefor cannot quote an exact price, but it’s a safe bet that the bottle would retail north of $1000. This has to represent the top echelon of Dr. deGrasse Tyson’s cellar. Clearly, he is implementing our ‘drink that bottle’ plan.

So your choice is simple: listen to what the scientific community has to say or watch how they actually behave. In other words

Positive:

Observation and walking the vineyard every day is the best fertilizer and way to manage.

If BD gets you into the vineyard more often

Negative:

Rudolph Steiner was a charlatan who did not believe in atomic theory

I equate BD and Mormonism:  batshit philosophies

BUT HERE'S THE MONEY SHOT:

Even if BD is 100% efficient in doing all the things the hippies want it to

BD was a system to encourage ripeness in Northern European vineyards

1339607780.0,v03d5,Argentina - Beyond Malbec,81611,29,3,19,"While Torrontes is the ""other"" grape of Argentina

Cabernet Sauvignon is the most notable. While in most parts of the world Cabs tend to be tannic and need some time to soften, they are much softer, and easier to approach young. I personally really like the style. In Tupungato (where I live) the Cabs tend to have a spicy character, along with being fruit forward. In the Barrancas section of Maipu, Cab as with all the grapes grown there, tend to have more structure, but are still softer than most other parts of the world. Even without a ton of tannin, thanks to the ample fruit that sees them through the years.

Bonarda is not well known outside of Argentina

Tempranillo gets the short shift, most are lighter, and very approachable. There is a charm to their soft cherry character even at this lower level. While they may not have the complexity of a Malbec or a Cab, they are often a more perfect lunch companion, especially in the warm days of summer. At around ten dollars, in a restaurant, they don't hurt the budget much either. I would be surprised to see many of these exported.

Petite Verdot is a blending grape which in Bordeaux has largely eclipsed Malbec. In Argentina it is the other way around, one of the most notable being Vistalba.

Syrah is common, but there is plenty of color already. One of my favorite grapes elsewhere, it is not wowing me here.

Merlot has varying success

Viognier is one of my favorite grapes, more than any of the other white grapes. Acidity is a real problem in these high dessert vineyards, and Viognier does a good job if holding its own. 

Chardonnay is prevalent

Sauvignon Blanc. Sorry

Friulano (formally known as Tocai Friulano, bad white wine in boxes. Some references cite there only being a small amount planted, but my on the site references assure me there is a lot of it. The one bright shining star from this grape is the Grand Lurton, from Francois Lurton. It is the base of a very interesting, maybe even exciting blend. Along with Viognier and Chardonnay, the Friulano makes a complex wine that is worth looking for.

We got to a bottle of Malbec that was very up front about a small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon being blended in (6%).  This started an interesting conversation about a winemaker's motives for adding a small percentage of blending grape into his or her wine and everyone was cheerfully chiming in until one guy tried to shut us all down by saying that he had worked in the wine industry and without exception the only reason why a winemaker would add such small amounts of another grape to the varietal was because he or she had some extra lying around and needed to get rid of it.  It's not art

The conversation started off pretty lightly. We talked about beer styles and trends, and had some very creative ideas. I decided it might be worth it to put him in touch with one of the largest and most successful craft breweries in Canada, the owners of which are very good friends of mine.

This is where things took a turn. I mentioned the name of the brewery, I asked him to elaborate. ""It's a diacetyl fault. The beer is too creamy.""

Alright

""Have you considered that people like that style of beer? Maybe that's why they sell so well?"" (To be honest

""No. It's bad beer.""

I don't normally get upset over things like this. But I'll be honest

""No thanks. I think macro-brewing is killing the industry. I don't want to be a part of it.""

And rather than argue, and seriously hoping I never see him again.

Now

**1) UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR BUSINESS IS PEOPLE

You are only as good as your ability to interact with other people. The general rule of thumb in the industry is a sparkling personality can sell a reasonably good product

**2) THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY IS A LOT LIKE THE ART INDUSTRY.**

I've never met someone who, industry best-sellers are the product of testing, reviewing, and marketing to a segment that can reasonably support your venture. Yes, there are a handful of people that develop their ""perfect recipe"" and manage to garner enough interest to support themselves, but for every one, there are a hundred ""starving artists"" out there.

*Understand that you will have to compromise your artistic integrity, you can make limited batches for the public. But if you're fresh out of brewer's college, don't start getting the impression that your kale-and-chipotle-porter is going to have you rolling in money and women.

**3) DO NOT MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY

There is something to be learned from absolutely everyone in the industry. Large companies can teach you about scaled production, which is gaining market entry. Do not ignore this, it is vital. When was the last time you saw a want-ad for ""winemaker""?

**4) NEVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER. INSULT SOMEONE'S PRODUCT.**

Would you show up to an art gallery and tell the artist ""your painting is absolute shit""? No. If you don't like it, and you move on. You try and understand why some people like the artist, and why some people dislike them. But you definitely don't talk shit about them. The industry is not as big as you think. People talk. And in an industry where the biggest names have been around for decades, names are not easily forgotten.

After the restaurant, but I was working for a gigantic, soul-sucking corporation and I hated the ethics of my company. I left after 2.5 years. 

I'm now a sales representative for a fine wine distributor. I have about 50 accounts: mostly independent retailers and locally-owned restaurants. My book is heavily Italian (we represent Winebow, but we also have a large NW presence, and a handful of California cult producers. Commission sales is a little nerve-wracking, but I love that my efforts translate directly into my paycheck. 

My ultimate goal in the industry is to end up as a national sales representative for a single winery or a portfolio that I strongly support. I love the wine business, and drinking the world's best wines.

Staying: Likely in Yountville - somewhere like Maison Fleurie - we are planning to spend 4 days in the Napa Valley and 3 in SF.

Food: We are currently debating going to The French Laundry. It's long been a dream of mine but worried husband will be underwhelmed because of cost (if we can even get a reservation). Would you recommend going or spreading the wealth to various other places? Recommendations for awesome hole-in-the-wall type places?

Wine: We love big cab sauvs and zinfandels. My husband also loves beer and I understand a visit to the Russian River Brewery is a must. We plan on visiting Cakebread

As for San Francisco

Anything I've missed? We are open to trying anything!

Edited to add: We plan on being in the Valley from a Tuesday to Saturday.

Well


Mine was in that first catering job I mentioned in another thread. I was working a function at the Town Hall and one of my duties was pre-opening the wine behind the bar (This was in the days when screwcaps were just starting to take-off in New Zealand


I'd seen my supervisor go through a case of wine and just take the entire foil capsule off the bottle neck. Ok, and I started copying him. Moments later one of our more experienced staff came over to me, slightly horrified, and said, ""What are you doing?"". I explained, and the guy says, ""Ok


He took out his Pulltap and showed me how to do a perfect [French cut](http://img4-3.realsimple.timeinc.net/images/food-recipes/cooking-tips/0808/081-s1-wine-bottle_160.jpg). He explained to me (nicely) that the foil is part of the bottle and removing it in entirety is akin to removing the front label. ""Ok"", he says, ""When you're drinking good wine you don't want *anything* coming into contact with it before it hits your glass. The foil is often made from metals and if you cut it at the top, the wine dribbles over the metal before it reaches the glass. It can potentially effect the taste and it's better not to take the risk"".


Well shit! I wasn't sure if I believed him


Later in life I would be taught how to decant old wine with a candle and what glasses to use with specific wines, to be honest, I actually started *thinking* about opening wine. And that's a good thing.

This sounds great

My question to the believers, but is the wine good because of biodynamics, or the winemaker?

You can only make great wine from great grapes

One of the great myths of wine is that non organic or biodynamic wines are the product of much fertilizers and chemical sprays. There are a few problems with this assertion. First and foremost, so why would anyone want to do more than they have to in the vineyard?

Bad wine is made from bad grapes (and all too often from good grapes and bad winemaking). Bulk wine vineyards are much more likely to be fertilized and sprayed. No one is making bulk wine from biodynamic practices. Why not? Cost. Even if the magic works

4- What is the best way to differenciate all of the words such as tannin, rich, soft, dry, simple, complex, etc.

5- How do you know what year a particular wine will be at its best? Because of the grapes used or somebody just taste it every year? Do they sell bottles made for aging in regular wine stores?

6- Are barrels generally used for aging the wine just good for one season or they can make several seasons? If so

I've been reluctant to bring this up, regardless of their experience or knowledge level. HOWEVER, I feel that there are a couple of types of posts that come up over and over again here that are getting really repetitive and tedious and drag the overall quality of the subreddit down:

**Post type #1: ""I found this old bottle of wine, and even if it is, it almost never has been stored properly to have any resale value. 

I think this could be solved with a simple addition to the sidebar simply stating that the bottle of wine that you found in grandma's closet probably isn't worth anything, etc.).

**Post type #2: ""What are some good (cheap) wines to try?""** This is just too broad of a question to foster any discussion of value

I don't think there's anything wrong with people asking about specific types of wine to try.  For example

I'm also a member of [/r/bicycling](/r/bicycling) , but perhaps, like many other subreddits do, we could provide a list, or a link to a post with a list, in the sidebar of some places to go for wine recommendations (i.e., eBob, Speculator

When they harvested and vinified their Chardonnay, Puligny, et all - are heavily oaked. These versions of oaked chardonnay are different, though. Taste them in their youth and they are all buttered popcorn and burnt toast. Give them 5 or, sometimes, *many* more years,  and they are the personification of elegance. Fruit, subtle oak spice

Over the next 30 or 40 years, long running amnesia about their original, Burgundian model. Oak became an overbearing but easy way to compensate for the lack of quality fruit, which was an unfortunate, economic necessity for those looking to turn a large profit. 

By 2012, rather than producing the best wine it could produce.

That being said, avoids Chardonnay: *It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest and most noble grapes on earth*: A mystifying chameleon that is capable of harnessing both a dominant personality and the complete submission required to express *terroir*. It saddens me that it is the brands of California which dominate the definition of Chardonnay in the mind of so many consumers. It saddens me to see people judge chardonnay without judging it's origin and producer first; this particular chameleon is only as great as its handlers, which I suppose could be said of all vinifera grapes. 

So, none of them taste like ice cream or a hot buttered rum:

- [Champagne Salon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_Champagne): Considered the greatest Champagne on the planet. All Blanc de Blanc Champagne is 100% Chardonnay, actually, another good reason to avoid judging wine by grape before origin.

- [Chablis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chablis_(wine) is considered by many to be one of the single greatest expressions of *terroir* on the planet. It is 100% Chardonnay.

- While oaked California Chardonnay currently plays the wine-nerd villain, California Chardonnays they can. [These wines](http://www.kistlervineyards.com/chardonnay/) are, contrary to popular belief, capable of aging, often for 7 - 10 years or longer, and they are world-class.

- And of course, the Macon, is the source of an unbelievable amount of affordable, delicious Chardonnay (which tend toward unoaked but are variant), it is the Northern part of Burgundy that shines the brightest. The [Cote de Beaune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_de_Beaune) is home to the greatest concentration of great Chardonnay villages, but the [Cote de Nuits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te_de_Nuits), despite its pinot-oriented rep

I would also add that Chardonnay has found wonderful homes in Italy, Oregon, South America, and South Africa, (and more) especially when in the hands of quality driven, passionate producers.

So I beseech you, noble grape's history and track-record of proven excellence before you decide you hate Chardonnay.

1) You had a wine while on vacation, I'm going to take the time to check with 12 different distributors to help you find it. This really does take a fair amount of time. Also, that wine you drank while having lunch on a hillside in Tuscany is going to be 2-5x as much here, and probably not taste nearly as good while eating frozen pizza around screaming kids; prepare yourself to be underwhelmed.

2) Ordering a single case of something might not guarantee that I can get it to you at the best available price. This varies from state to state, depending on the buy.

3) Please God, I'm probably going to look bad and I doubt you're going to stick around for my explanation as to why I'm so expensive. As a retailer, I get REALLY nervous about people perceiving me as being too expensive.

4) Please pick up your order in a timely fashion and buy the ENTIRE order. While we work really hard to accommodate as many people as we can, ordering a six pack of something and then deciding you only want two bottles is borderline infuriating. I'm now stuck with product I didn't want and have to figure out what to do with it. There's probably a good reason I didn't have it on my shelf in the first place.

I was thinking of picking from different crus so we could compare.  If so

I've been out of wine for a couple of years and am just now getting back in.  I have access to a local liquor store that carries a nice selection of wines, but no specialty shops, sadly.

There is an amazing study done by Hogue Cellars [Here](http://hoguecellars.com/feature/homework.html)

There has been a good deal of study on enclosures and their resistance to oxygen. Scholarly papers tend to cost a great deal to read
abstracts are worth glancing at. [Here is a Google Search](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=oxygen+permeation+cork&amp;hl=en). Summary : More air may get in through the sides of natural cork then through the cork itself. This changes over time

The jury is out on the importance of oxygen permeability during aging. Peynaud said no, even those aged for decades.

TCA is responsible for the nasty aroma of a ""corked wine"" due to the bleaching process of the corks (not a fungus) but as [Perdue points out in this quick read](http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf) just using chlorinated water or certain cleaning solutions may lead to airborne TCA contamination.

For 10 years I taught a wine tasting course and the very first exercise was a component tasting. This is an invaluable tool for everyone

You take several bottles of simple red wine and you add the basic wine flavors to each. Control (nothing added), grape tannin, tartaric acid, untoasted oak, toasted oak. A teaspoon of each, or so, is all you need.

You learn three valuable lessons when you do this. First, see the note in the next paragraph). And finally that each of us has different thresholds for these basic tastes.

Note: Most people, change one side and another side is also affected. Adding acid makes a wine astringent, which is the dryness against your front teeth that is associated with tannin but is made more pronounced when the acid balance is raised - technically the drying of the buccal membranes [Source](http://www.sensorysociety.org/ssp/wiki/Astringency/). The haptic sensation for tannin is a tightening in your jaw muscles. Grape tannin about half way back, and oak tannin all the way back.

The upshot of each of us having different thresholds is that it to some degree determines our preferences. If the wine with the tannin doesn't taste too strong to you

I have done these tastings at shows and wowed people with my predictions of their likes and dislikes.

So next time you pass up dessert remember that it is because you have a low threshold for sugar and it is much sweeter to you then for most people.

This was sent to me by a regular customer of mine a few months ago (only just remembered it). She had bought a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc from us and consumed most of it without anything untoward appearing, because why the hell would you put that in your wine-hole?), but couldn't really elaborate on what the off flavour was. 

Now, nor did we find another in our stores after we had a look. I thought initially that maybe whatever it was had precipitated after coming into contact with oxygen, but as we keep bottles of this same wine open in the stores for tastings and none of those exhibited the same junk in the bottom, my theory bit the dust...

Can anyone shed any light on this? As it's not happened again
I guess we could call shenanigans on my customer

It is a great opportunity for pros, academics and noobies to exchange methods, views and approaches. there was a thread on jancis that started like this:

""In my experience with blind tasting competitions I've been fascinated to observe the cultural differences that seem to exist when tasting wine.

The British school of thought, the intensity and profile of aromas and flavours, then the 'structure' of the wine: acidity, alcohol, sweetness, etc. We then arrive at a conclusion about the wine relating to its origin, its quality, etc.

The French

The Australians I've observed focus a lot on the texture of a wine - where the wine 'hits' the tongue

I'm curious as to how everyone tastes and assesses wine (whether blind or not) and if you have noticed any particular approaches associated with different cultures.""

I have been to more than these, is the results of last year's People's Chice Awards (which I did not have a vote in - and winners are noted).  So this is an exclusive report for /r/wine. 

* Achaval Ferrer - Tiny winery with very high quality wines with even higher prices.
* Alta Vista - Solid performer
* Andeluna - Founded by the heir to Frito-Lay. An early player in the Uco Valley / Tupungato area. Great views
* Atamisque - Small but gorgeous winery with well made wine that are not my favorites. Restaurant for lunch is famous for their trout.
* Benegas - Old family winery that has very pricey wines. Most too structured for my taste. Top wine good
* Bodega Bomba - Beautiful estate
* Bodega Norton - A long time leader in production. Good for the money
* Bodega Weinert - Specializes in high quality wines with a great deal of age on them. 
* CarinaE - Tiny winery
* Catena Zapata - One of the best known of the top wineries. Their very best is very good. Everything else is good for the money.
* Clos de Chacras - Structure forward wines that are good examples of their class. Fun little restaurant.
* Diamandes - Part of Michelle Roland’s Clos de Siete group. Very over produced wines
* Dolium Winery - A very small winery built underground. A true gem. Their Cabernet especially ages well and is exceptional. Buy any time you see one.
* Domain Bousquet - Formally Domaine Jean Bousquet. High quality
* Don Bosco - Old churn owned school and winery. Wines are not up to modern standards
* Familia Zuccardi - The biggest of the big. Their Santa Julia line is common
* Finca Agostino - Solid medium of the road producer.
* Flichman - Big
* Francois Lurton - One of the original Europeans to discover  the wine potential of Argentina. High quality
* La Azul - Microscopically small winery with very high quality wines
* Lagarde - Very high quality
* Lopez - The big boy of aging wine in casks forever. Moderate quality but a rare chance to taste well aged wines for very low prices.
* Masi Tupungato - From one of the largest agricultural companies in the world, passito (dried grapes) based reds and unusual white blends. Kudos for individuality, even if the wines are not my favorites.
* Navarro Correas - Owned by Diageo, it helps to have deep pockets. Best at the upper end.
* Nieto Sentiner - A solid performer and producer of perhaps the best Bonarda in Mendoza.
* O.Fournier - Very high quality
* Otero Ramos - A self made man who worked his way from picking grapes to owning a modern winery. The wines reflect the experience and passion. One of the best high end Cabs.
* Pulenta Estates - A very old and prestigious wine making family. the brothers who own this winery are more famous for racing cars
* Pulmary Winery - Fly speck of an organic winery in an old repurposed bodega in downtown Chacras. Pricey for what they offer.
* Ruca Malen - Very high quality
* Salentein Winery - Beautiful winery
* Tapiz - Great tour
* Tempus Alba - Innovative and high quality. Their Vero Malbec is one of my very favorites

I have been asked a few questions about Argentina and the wines and so I thought I would post a series of articles

With this first introductory post let me tell you that the other posts will be:

A list of the award winners from a people's choice blind tasting I held last year

A list of the wineries I have written about in the last two years with a short critique of each

A look beyond Malbec at the other grapes of Argentina

I wanted to ask if any of you have any other questions outside of these I could answer

I'd like to create a template for a ""what did you drink today?"" post or something similar, reviews, etc.  They would be self-posts only. With the new Link Flair feature, I can make a tag that will distinguish the posts for fun and exposure.  I can also create custom CSS to distinguish posts. It would be something that any user can create at any time.

I envision it functioning somewhat like [MFA's](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice) [WAYWT](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=WAYWT&amp;restrict_sr=on).

Sorry about the picture quality!

http://imgur.com/a/Owd8c

Some of my woefully inadequate notes follow:

From the left

1. Chateau Lanessan Haut Medoc 2003 France (Bordeaux)
    Not a bad Bordeaux. At this age the colour starts to become a seductive bricky red rather than the deep red of the jailbait vintages. Really nice caramel and black cherry wafts. I also got fresh chopped bananas... Medium body with the tannins settled but a bit of a short finish. If it were cheaper I would recommend it as a show of how certain flavours in wine develop over time.

2. Torreon de Paredes Valle de Rengo Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - Chile
    I tripped up on this one at first. I mistook it for an Australian wine. Hey, but once you get past that there is some strawberry as well. The taste is quite fruity, a bit of a contrast to the smell. Very tannic but would be pleasant with some grilled meat I reckon. Medium body with a decent finish. Not a big fan of this one, but that could be my limited palate's fault.

3. Aramis Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon 2010 - Australia
   This was the kicker. I thought this was French at first. Beautiful deep colouring and a powerful fruity nose with plenty of cassis and chocky too. This wine is a great mouthful. A really rounded

4. Ile La Forge Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - France (Languedoc)
   This Paul Mas wine was very up front with aromas of ripe mandarines. Light on the tannins and not a bad finish but not much length. Pretty cheap so would have no problems drinking it again.

5. Mercedes Eguren Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 Bodegas - Spain
   This is the one my nose kept coming back to. I think because I am still new to all this

Well, bring it on...
