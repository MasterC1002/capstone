1315686094.0,kbeoe,You can make readline (and bash) much more user friendly by adding a few options to ~/.inputrc,metellius,178,30,21,"I spent some time reading through the readline manpages

**set completion-ignore-case on**

This one is pretty obvious from the name; when completing case will not be taken into consideration.

Example:

    $ ls
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-4  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-7  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-11  VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-6  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-8  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-9
    $ ls very&lt;TAB&gt;
    $ ls VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt



**set completion-prefix-display-length 2**

This one is insanely useful when you have a folder with lots of similarly named files and you are not sure how far the completion has gone when you press TAB. The first part that has been completed will be replaced by ""...""

Example:

    $ ls
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-4  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-7  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-11  VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-6  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-8  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-9
    $ ls long&lt;TAB&gt;
    ...7-4   ...7-6   ...7-7   ...7-8   ...8-11  ...8-9
    $ ls longFileNameLINUX-2.6.3


** Control-j: menu-complete**

** Control-k: menu-complete-backward**

These two will make Ctrl-j and Ctrl-k to cycle through the available completions. This is useful when you get a small number of possible completions (say 2-4)

Example:

    $ ls
    cfg-common.h  cfg-mencoder.h  cfg-mplayer-def.h  cfg-mplayer.h
    $ ls cfg&lt;TAB&gt;
    ...common.h       ...mencoder.h     ...mplayer-def.h  ...mplayer.h
    $ ls cfg-&lt;Press ctrl-j three times&gt;
    $ ls cfg-mplayer-def.h


(As a bonus

    $ ls &lt;Press ctrl-j three times&gt;
    $ ls cfg-mplayer-def.h


**set show-all-if-ambiguous on**

**set show-all-if-unmodified on**

These will make completions appear immediately after pressing TAB once


**set completion-map-case on**

With this enabled

* `dirname`: This is the counterpart of `basename`.  Give `dirname` a path

        $ dirname /var/tmp/foo 
        /var/tmp

* `du`: Disk usage.  This utility will describe how much space a file or tree of directories uses on disk.  Note that this is different from the size that `ls -l` will return.  `ls` will report the logical size of the file: if a file appears to contain one megabyte of data, du will return that size.  Using [sparse files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file) is the most-common cause of this effect.  Because du returns sizes in blocks, which is typically a rather large and hard-to-read number, it's common to use the syntax `du -h`, which prints sizes in a human-readable form.  I also commonly use -m for ""size in megabytes"" and then numerically-sort the output; this provides a good summary of the things that consume the largest amount of space in a directory tree:

        du -m /var|sort -n

* `env`: Run in a given environment (as in

        $ env -i PATH=/bin:/usr/bin ls

    Second, env is sometimes used after the shebang in scripts to run a program, no matter where it is, as long as it is in PATH.

    If the following shows up as the first line of a perl script

        #!/usr/bin/env perl

* `expand`: If a file is using tabs rather than spaces for indentation

* `expr`: This permits computing a mathematical expression.  For example:

        $ a=$(expr 2 ""*"" 6)
        $ echo $a
        12

    This program is very easy to misuse, expand things like asterisks; they must be quoted.  Arithmetic expansion is similar (though not identical) to `expr`, and I normally use it instead, since it avoids the quoting issues and is more concise:

        $ a=$((2 * 6))
        $ echo $a
        12

* `factor`: Compute the [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization) of a number:

        $ factor 12
        12: 2 2 3

* `fmt` and `fold`: hard-wrap text to fit a particular width terminal.

* `groups`: Show the groups that a Unix user belongs to.  I tend to just refer to /etc/group:

        $ groups wadcann root
        wadcann : wadcann cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev fuse kvm
        root : root

* `head`: Prints the first N lines or bytes of a file.  This and its counter part `tail` (which prints the last N lines or bytes of a file) are quite useful.  I used them to dump the current list of coreutils programs that I am reciting here

        $ dpkg -L coreutils|grep bin|sort|head -n60|tail -n20

* `hostid`: I've never needed to use this for anything practical.  It prints a numeric GUID for the given host, which makes collisions much more likely than (for example) Microsoft's large GUIDs.

* `id`: Show the userid (uid) and the effective userid (euid).  When you run something as root via ""sudo""

* `install`: Performs a copy and sets ownership and permissions on the destination file all in one command; otherwise, and `chown` the file.  Historically, I've most-commonly seen this used in Makefiles for the `make install` command.

* `join`: Perform a ""join"", but it's very handy for scripts when it is needed.  Here's an example.  I've two text files, the first called useros.txt:

        Bob Linux
        Jane Windows

    And another textfile

        Windows $97.49
        Linux $0
        Mac $19.99

    Then the following command finds lines with ""matching columns"":

        $ join -1 2 &lt;(sort useros.txt) &lt;(sort license_cost.txt)
        Linux Bob $0
        Windows Jane $97.49

* `link`: Creates hardlinks.  I always use `ln` for this rather than `link`.

* `logname`: Prints the username of the user logged in on the current terminal.  More reliable than

* `md5sum`: Computes a hash of a file

* `mkfifo`: Creates a FIFO, or for daemons that are expected to just listen for data, waiting to read from a file, and process it when data is written to it.

* `nice`: Makes processes ""nicer"", lower numbers are higher priority).

* `rm`: Removes a file or directory.  The most useful bits of rm that I probably make use of: -r removes an entire directory tree.  -f asks rm to succeed whether-or-not the thing could actually be removed

* `rmdir`: Removes a directory

* `sleep`: Wait for the specified number of seconds

* `stty`: I believe this stands for ""set tty"".  It's used to set settings on a terminal.  While this provides very fine-grained control over a terminal

        stty erase \^?

    or

        stty erase ^H

    To set the erase character to either ""backspace"" or ""delete""; historically

        stty sane

    is also somewhat common; this resets a terminal to fairly reasonable values.  If a terminal is printing ""stair steps""

* `sync`: Syncs the buffer cache and the disk.  Normally, but instead to the kernel's buffer cache in RAM.  The kernel normally performs a sync before killing the power when rebooting the system, so manually executing this is rarely a concern.  If for some reason you cannot cleanly shut down a system (I have had this happen), `sync` will push as much data as possible to the disk.

* `touch`: Time Of User CHange.  `touch foo` will change the modification time of file ""foo"" to be now, touch will create it.

* `true`: Returns with an exit code 0

* `uname`: ""Unix name"".  Prints a lot more information than just the name, respectively.

* `vdir`: Like `dir` and `ls`

* `[`: This is a bit of an odd name for a program

        a=bleh
        if [ -n $a ]; then
            echo a has been set
        fi

    The ""["" bit was once a program and if your shell has ""["" built in to it to avoid wasting time launching an extra program each time

    Typically, it doesn't know how you quote things in your shell.  If variable values have spaces, it's unaware of the fact:

        a=bleh blah
        if [ -n $a ]; then
            echo a has been set
        fi

    This will fail, however, and things will work, because [[ is guaranteed to be part of your shell and knows that everything that ""$a"" expands to will be a single value.

* `arch`: Prints the architecture of the machine.  I rarely use this

* `base64`: [Base-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encodes a value as a particular type of ASCII string:

        $ echo foo|base64
        Zm9vCg==

    It can be decoded with `base64 -d`.

    This is used when you can not store arbitrary binary data, but they can contain Base64-encoded ASCII of any data, including a ""0"" byte.

* `basename`: This prints the ""filename"" portion of a path.  For example:

        $ basename /tmp/foo
        foo

* `chcon`: Used by SELinux (a rather-elaborate Linux security framework for running processes with a restricted set of permissions) to affect how processes can access a file.  I don't use SELinux

* `cksum`: Checksum.  A [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) is a small value that changes if the input changes.  This is useful for creating two small values that can then be later compared to see if the contents of a file have changed

        $ echo ""bar"" &gt;foo
        $ cksum foo
        3848730072 4 foo

    Any file containing ""bar"" and exactly ""bar"" will produce the same checksum.  cksum doesn't see much use these days, and the slower SHA256 where cryptographic use is required.

* `comm`: Compare two files.  If you've two files with lines, ten thousand files that used to be in a directory, and want to see if the new directory listing has any new files, and if so what they are.

* `csplit`: context split.  This can split a file up based on regular expressions.  Let's say that you have a file named foo.txt that looks like this INI

        [global]
        first_setting=1
        second_setting=2
        [master]
        override=1
        [slave]
        third_setting=3
        fourth_setting=4

    Then running the command `csplit -f foo-part. foo.txt ""/\^\[.*\]/"" ""{*}""`

    Will create three files, and foo-part.03, each containing the contents of one of the above sections.

* `cut`:  This is a utility that I use an awful lot -- it lets one take a particular ""field"" from a line of text.  For example

        John $5
        Mary $3
        Ted $4

    Then the command

        grep ^Mary foo.txt|cut -d"" "" -f 2

    Will print ""$3"".

    I find this particularly helpful in conjunction with `tr -s "" ""`.  Many programs print an arbitrary number of spaces around their columns.  For example

        wadcann  pts/6    :pts/5:S.0       23:56    3.00s  0.00s  0.00s emacsclient -a
        wadcann  pts/7    :pts/2:S.1       23:58   24:36   0.04s  0.00s pager -s

    There are a lot of spaces in there.  But passing this data through `tr -s "" ""` squeezes runs of spaces down to one space:

        wadcann pts/6 :pts/5:S.0 23:56 5.00s 0.00s 0.00s emacsclient -a
        wadcann pts/7 :pts/2:S.1 23:58 25:52 0.04s 0.00s pager -s

    I can then pass that to `cut -d"" "" -f 3` and grab the third field.

There's a package called [teapot](http://www.syntax-k.de/projekte/teapot/) which, one might use `@(x()-1,y()-1)/@(x()-1,y())`).  I was surprised to find it doing integer arithmetic by default (that is, 3/4 = 0, whereas 3.0/4.0 = .75).  The function library is also fairly small.

`dpkg -L coreutils|grep bin|sort|head -n20`:

* `cat`: concatenates files, then file2, then file3.  Cat is actually most commonly used not to concatenate files, but to output the contents of a single file, since if only one file is listed, its behavior will be to show the contents of just that file.

* `chgrp`: Changes the group owning a file.  On a Linux system

        $ ls -l /tmp/foo
        drwxrwxrwx 21 root root 16384 Feb 28 23:05 /tmp/foo

    The first ""root"" means that the owning user is ""root""

* `chmod`: Changes the permissions on a file.  You can see above how /tmp/foo had three clumps of ""rwx"".  That's (Read, for the group that owns the file, and for other (everyone else).  There are two syntaxes often used; one of these is convenient for changing the existing permissions slightly, and the other for setting all the permissions at once.  `chmod o+rw` will add read and write permissions to ""other"".  `chmod 755` treats 755 as an octal (base-8) number.  This is convenient, because an octal digit has three ones or zeroes in it when written in binary -- 7 is 111, and 5 is 101.  If you take each of the 1s and 0s from writing out the digits in order, you get the full set of rwx permissions.  755 is 111101101

* `chown`: Change owner.  This works the same way that chgrp does

* `cp`: copy files or directories.  One useful option is cp -a

* `date`: This prints out the current date and time.  This is a handy way to see the current time

* `dd`: I don't actually know what ""dd"" stands for; probably something like ""data duplicator"".  `dd` moves data from one place to another.  Unlike most Unix utilities

* `df`: Shows disk free space on mounted filesystems.  I most commonly use this like so: `df -h`

* `dir`: The same thing as ""ls"": a tool for listing files.

* `echo`: This command simply sends to its stdout whatever arguments were given it on the command line:

        $ echo foo
        foo
        $

    It's probably most-commonly used for pushing small amounts of data into another program's standard input.   There are two useful arguments that I make use of -- -n will tell `echo` not to print a newline at the end of what it echoed, and ""\n"" into a newline character.

* `false`: This program simply exits with a non-zero exit code

* `ln`: This program creates hardlinks and symlinks.  I rarely see hardlinks used.  `ln -s foo bar` will create a symlink called ""bar"" that points at ""foo""; when attempting to access ""bar""

* `ls`: This program lists files.  The options I make most use of are -a, which lists permissions and other metadata associated with the file.

* `mkdir`: This program makes a directory.  The option that I make most use of is -p, -p will cause the command not to fail if the directory already exists.

* `mknod`: Make a special file node, these files had to be automatically-created, and mknod was the way to do this.

* `mktemp`: Make a temporary file or directory.  Sometimes you're running a script and you want to store some data temporarily somewhere.  Well, the files would crash into each other.  mktemp will create the file and print its name.  A typical usage might be:

        tempfile=$(mktemp)
        wget http://www.google.com/index.html -O ""$tempfile""
        lines=$(wc -l ""$tempfile"")
        echo ""Google's homepage currently has $lines lines""
        rm ""$tempfile""

* `mv`: move.  This utility moves or renames files.

* `pwd`: Prints the working directory.  Each process on a Unix system has a ""current working directory"" associated with it; the most obvious example is bash.  Running `pwd` will show the entire path to a working directory.

* `readlink`: Normally, rather than relative.

1351062768.0,11zur1,A plea to consider carefully the name of your command-line program,wadcann,77,48,45,"I enjoy a joke as much as anyone else.  But the Unix command line has a peculiar tendency to develop puns; someone working on a project comes up with a name that makes them laugh for a moment, in-jokes that made sense at the time the software was introduced and to the few users of that software become downright forehead-wrinkling years later to a broader array of users.  A few examples:

* [`tac`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tac_%28Unix%29).  [`cat`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29) is a traditional Unix program that catenates files; that is, of course, ""cat"" backwards.  It takes standard input and prints out the lines it is given in reverse order.  But understanding that requires grasping an in-joke that depends on Unix history (and it's not as if `tac` even converts ""cat"" to ""tac"", as it only reverses the order of lines; the more-reasonably-named `rev` reverses the order of characters).

* [`toe`](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=toe&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=Debian+testing+wheezy&amp;format=html&amp;locale=en).  Unix has a system called [terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) that contains information about various terminals; it maps $TERM to a set of features that that terminal has.  To speed access to this database and reduce its size, one could pun off the game of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), but ""tac"" had already been taken to complete the *above* pun, so ""toe"" was the only option remaining to complete the pun.  I doubt that the typical user is going to make much sense out of this name, given the amount of history required to understand the in-joke.

* [`lynx`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29) and friends.  This is one of the worst of offenders, like [`elinks`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks), `links2`, and another unfortunate addition to the can't-be-verbally-distinguished crowd, [`linkx`](http://linkx.sourceforge.net/).

* [`pine`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_%28e-mail_client%29) and friends.  Originally, as an in-joke, the `pine` program was produced.  After that, the floodgates were opened for [`alpine`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_%28email_client%29), [`balsa`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsa_%28e-mail_client%29), [`spruce`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/spruce/), and [`mahogany`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahogany_%28email_client%29).  This one isn't nearly as bad in my book; users normally keep using an email client for quite a bit

* [`nano`](http://www.nano-editor.org/).  Speaking of pine, its replacement was a pun on ""pico"" -- ""nano"".  Years after pico is dead, ""nano"" isn't a terribly obvious name for an easy-to-use text-based editor; the users who *most* might want to find and use `nano` are the ones to whom the name is probably not very obvious.

* [`clit`](http://www.convertlit.com/download.php).  Point driven further home by the source tree, and it doesn't involve any esoteric in-jokes.  The Debian packagers avoided some controversy by renaming the package (but not binary) to ""convlit"".

And while I think that the command-line gets the worst of this, was retronymed to mean nothing after having ""Pimp-Ass Newsreader"" being the GNOME newsreader became a bit embarrassing.

That's not to say ""don't have fun with the program""

1331840696.0,qy896,How to multithread a bash command,MarcusHauss,41,6,17,"Had you ever had to do something that took a long time and wished that you could do more than one of those commands at a time? Then you may use multithreading.

Basically:
    xargs -P4 -i command 

What this does is that it will spawn up to 4 processes/threads of the command you used to do single threaded.

Now, I will give you an example I'm using at this very moment, download images from tumblr.

    cat links_file.txt | xargs -n1 -P20 -t -i wget -rH -Dmedia.tumblr.com

    -A ""*index*"" -A jpeg,gif,png --level=10 -nd -nc \

    http://'{}' \

*This is how it works step by step*

Before starting

    for page in `seq ${PAGE1} 1 ${PAGE2}`;
    do
    echo ""${ADDR}.tumblr.com/page/${page}"" &gt;&gt; ${LINKS_FILE}
    done

Get it? I asked the address that coms before .tumblr.com (ADDR), and the LINKS_FILE points to a document text on the same location where the script is.


After we have our links on a format of (NOTE THE MISSING HTTP AT THE BEGGINING):

    site.tumblr.com/page/1

    site.tumblr.com/page/2

    /site.tumblr.com/page/3

    etc

Then it is just a matter of mass sending it to xarg and spawn as many wget threads as you can.

1. We cat the links file to obtain the first line

2. We send that to xargs who will spawn a wget command that will recursively download (r) the site and span hosts (-H)

3. -Dmedia.tumblr.com

4. -A ""[0-9]"" -A ""*index*"" -A jpeg,gif,png. -A is the counterpart to -R. This tells wget to allow files that contains jpeg, jpg, bmp, gif, or png and to allow any files that contain index and to allow files that contain 0, 2, 6, we need the number to download pages from the archive

5. --level=10 tells wget to go 10 levels deep. This would be dangerous except that we’ve restricted domains and limited the file names that can be downloaded

6. -nd tells wget not to recreate the directory structure and to instead download all of the files into the current working directory.

7. -nc tells gets not to re-download files that exist. This is to keep tumblr happy with us and prevent files from being needlessly redownloaded.

8. Finally at the end it will replace '{}' for what it read from the links file.

At the end it will spawn up to 40 threads (-P40) each one of them with one link of the file

This is written by me with some parts and explanations obtained from somewhere I do not remember.

1327547310.0,ox1yy,You can use 'pcal' to quickly generate calendars.,,38,8,3,"I found out about pcal a few months ago and I've been amazed ever since. I'm not a big fan of having all of my personal stuff on Google Calendar so I had to find another way to keep myself up-to-date and started using pcal. I'm also a big fan of having paper calendars... and pcal can do that too!

You can fins more about pcal on the [project's sourceforge page](http://pcal.sourceforge.net/) but since the documentation is huge

The easiest thing is to print a year-long, 4 pages per sheet) I use this as my planner for school. I like having the whole month on a single page... it gives me enough room each day without being too big.

&gt;pcal -b all -S 2012 | ps2pdf - 2012.pdf

pcal outputs the calendar(s) in PostScript so we pipe it to ps2pdf in order to get a pdf as a result. I print from school so it's better for me to have a pdf than a postscript file anyways. If you find the font to be a bit too big you can change it:

&gt;pcal -b all -S -d /12 -t /24 | ps2pdf - 2012.pdf

The -t switch changes the header (month) while the -d changes the size of the date (in each square) leaving more room for you to add stuff.

The really need thing about pcal is that you can 'feed' it some events to be automatically added to your calendars. A file containing events might look something like this:

&gt;25/01/2011 Assignment 1 due today

&gt;26/01/2011 Day off!

&gt;27/01/2011 Exam 1

&gt;27/01/2011 Dentist appointment

The cool thing with pcal is that it supports a pretty wide range of formats for events. For example,False,self,t5_2s4oq,False,,,t3_ox1yy

When I (/u/galaktos) read the usage examples of chrisallenlane's script, but instead execute it directly; and second, I would love to be able to declare variables in the command that would be prompted when I executed the cheat. I first thought this might take several weeks in C (I originally wanted to use JSON as file format - ridiculous), but after thinking a bit more, reading xseeks' file format suggestion, and then moving most of the work into the file format, I managed to [make it in bash](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k57gj/cheat_allows_you_to_create_and_view_interactive/cbm19wl) in a few hours ([direct GitHub link](https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/cheats)).

For example, but you'd have to open up another terminal (or terminal tab) to do anything else.  With screen you only have to do Control A c

Basics: ""screen"" to enter screen.  It looks exactly the same as your regular prompt, in shorthand, by C-a n, with ""C-a"" meaning pressing Ctrl and a at the same time, and n being any other key.

Inside screen you can create new ""windows"" with C-a c
You can name these new windows with C-a A
You can switch between them with C-a 0-9 

C-a k will kill a window.

C-a D will ""detach"".  Screen will still be running (along with all programs inside it), if you logout of GUI, you can still get to your programs...they didn't stop).

""screen -r"" will reattach to the session.  This is done outside of screen (after you're detached).  I recommend only having one instance of screen at a time

C-a S will split the window horizontally.  You would then C-a TAB over to the new section, not an L or i) to split the window vertically.  To resize a section, you can do C-a :resize # (replace # with a number) then enter.

Things like git are pretty good with doing auto-paging, then kill it and restart `!! | less`. This got me wondering, exactly where should the responsibility for paging lie?  We have a few options:

* The terminal - Either the actual terminal emulator (`xterm`, ...), or a term mux like tmux or GNU Screen.  Screen copy-mode is pretty horrible, not sure about tmux, and almost all actual terminal(-emulators) have pretty poor scrollback support, compared with a real paging capability like `less`/`most`. It would certainly be possible to add paging in here, but it seems perhaps a bit too low-level to be execing a filter process and streaming through it

In my quests

&gt;      exec !..| less
    |less 

&gt; This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|` is needed to give the user control over the pager although it gets its input from the window's process. This works

    $ less --version
    less 444

    :(
* The shell - It is responsible for hooking up your stdin/out/err during process invocation I think
Obviously you'd probably want a white/blacklist of which processes to handle
In addition, is sometimes really irritating)


* Individual apps - How it currently works, and anything else that respects `$PAGER`

It's a crapload of effort to build it in at the app level though

I've seen a few cute hacks like [colourising STDERR](http://serverfault.com/questions/59262/bash-print-stderr-in-red-color) with some exec/redirect magic at the shell(?) level.

[stderred](https://github.com/sickill/stderred) takes a more hardcore approach of hooking `*write()` libc calls with `LD_PRELOAD`

* The user - quit being such a lazy bastard and just type the `|less` or alias your favourite commands or make a special keybinding or something.  That's what I'm doing now, and if a solution were inserted far enough up the hierarchy, I could imagine it Just Working for the output of remote commands via ssh, for example.

I have created these shell scripts to help me synchronize misaligned downloaded subtitles to the corresponding movie.

First you have to find the correct time for displaying the 1st &amp; last line by just playing the video file.

Then you run the synsubcalc.sh script

If for example the downloaded .srt has marked the 1st line at 0 hours 1 minute 12.35 seconds and you want to move this to 0 hours 2 minutes 44 seconds &amp; the last line is incorrectly marked at 1hrs 34mins 3secs but it should be at 1hrs 41mins 12secs

synsubcalc.sh 0:1:12.35 0:2:44 1:34:3 1:41:12

This would calculate a delay &amp; multiplier.

Then you just run the second script synchrosubs.sh [filename.srt] [delay] [multiplier] &gt; newfile.srt

If I wasn't too bored I could combine the two scripts into one

$normal  

Color modifiers:

$black, $orange, $blue, $purple, $aqua, $gray, $darkgray
$lightred, $lightblue, $lightpurple, $lightaqua, $white

All color options are case sensitive! ALL CAPS modifies background

$RED would highlight the text with red.
$red would change the color of the text to red.

To clear a color (still case sensitive):

$default

Remember

Hint: you can use colors right next to text with backslashes: $red\text

Example usage:

echo $blue this is blue $RED$black\This is black with red background $underline\this is underlined $normal\normal

Copy and paste this into your script:

    bold=`echo -en ""\e[1m""`; underline=`echo -en ""\e[4m""`; dim=`echo -en ""\e[2m""`; strickthrough=`echo -en ""\e[9m""`; blink=`echo -en ""\e[5m""`; reverse=`echo -en ""\e[7m""`; hidden=`echo -en ""\e[8m""`; normal=`echo -en ""\e[0m""`; black=`echo -en ""\e[30m""`; red=`echo -en ""\e[31m""`; green=`echo -en ""\e[32m""`; orange=`echo -en ""\e[33m""`; blue=`echo -en ""\e[34m""`; purple=`echo -en ""\e[35m""`; aqua=`echo -en ""\e[36m""`; gray=`echo -en ""\e[37m""`; darkgray=`echo -en ""\e[90m""`; lightred=`echo -en ""\e[91m""`; lightgreen=`echo -en ""\e[92m""`; lightyellow=`echo -en ""\e[93m""`; lightblue=`echo -en ""\e[94m""`; lightpurple=`echo -en ""\e[95m""`; lightaqua=`echo -en ""\e[96m""`; white=`echo -en ""\e[97m""`; default=`echo -en ""\e[39m""`; BLACK=`echo -en ""\e[40m""`; RED=`echo -en ""\e[41m""`; GREEN=`echo -en ""\e[42m""`; ORANGE=`echo -en ""\e[43m""`; BLUE=`echo -en ""\e[44m""`; PURPLE=`echo -en ""\e[45m""`; AQUA=`echo -en ""\e[46m""`; GRAY=`echo -en ""\e[47m""`; DARKGRAY=`echo -en ""\e[100m""`; LIGHTRED=`echo -en ""\e[101m""`; LIGHTGREEN=`echo -en ""\e[102m""`; LIGHTYELLOW=`echo -en ""\e[103m""`; LIGHTBLUE=`echo -en ""\e[104m""`; LIGHTPURPLE=`echo -en ""\e[105m""`; LIGHTAQUA=`echo -en ""\e[106m""`; WHITE=`echo -en ""\e[107m""`; DEFAULT=`echo -en ""\e[49m""`;

Using this, this causes my session to crash on the receiving terminal after it displays the message.

There's about 110k items in the emails.txt file


long version

- egrep the log file to create a smaller log file containing just lines with status=sent and status=deferred
- grep for lines containing status=sent
- grep for lines containing status=deferred
- use comm to remove lines from the deferred.txt file *that also appear in the sent.txt file* &gt; deferredNotSent.txt

Then I would like to: 

- grep -f deferredNotSent.txt mail.log | perl to grab email addresses

However

I started a project called [clicraft](http://dmbuce.github.com/clicraft/) a while back. It's basically just a script that wraps around and provides functionality for a server (a Minecraft server

Simplifying a bit, they are commands that are interpreted by the server and affect its internal state).

**The Problem**

The commands do not have return codes/exit codes indicating success or failure

**The Solution?**

Look at this ugly thing I created:

    # Usage: serverlog &lt;condition&gt; &lt;command&gt;
    #
    # Run &lt;command&gt; and print server.log to stdout until a &lt;condition&gt; is reached or
    # TIMEOUT seconds have passed
    #
    # If &lt;condition&gt; is an integer
    # of lines to print. Otherwise
    # expression
    serverlog() {
    	local TIMERPID CONDITION retval
    
    	CONDITION=""$1""
    	shift
    
    	if [ $# = 0 ]; then
    		warn ""Usage: serverlog &lt;condition&gt; &lt;command&gt;""
    	fi
    
    	# launch a process in the background that will time out eventually
    	sleep ""$TIMEOUT"" &amp;
    	TIMERPID=""$!""
    
    	# if CONDITION is an integer
    	if [ ""$CONDITION"" -eq ""$CONDITION"" ] 2&gt;/dev/null; then
    		# print server.log to stdout and quit after CONDITION lines
    		tail -fn0 --pid ""$TIMERPID"" ""$SERVER_DIR/server.log"" | {
    			head -n ""$CONDITION""
    			retval=0
    			kill ""$TIMERPID"" 2&gt;/dev/null
    		} &amp;
    	else
    		# print server.log to stdout
    		tail -fn0 --pid ""$TIMERPID"" ""$SERVER_DIR/server.log"" &amp;
    
    		# kill timeout process when we see CONDITION in server.log
    		tail -fn0 --pid ""$TIMERPID"" ""$SERVER_DIR/server.log"" | {
    			egrep -ql ""$CONDITION""
    			retval=$?
    			kill ""$TIMERPID"" 2&gt;/dev/null
    		} &amp;
    	fi
    
    	# run command
    	""$@""
    
    	# wait until the backgrounded timeout process exits
    	{
    		tail -fn0 --pid ""$TIMERPID"" /dev/null
    	} &amp;&gt;/dev/null
    
    	return $retval
    }

TIMEOUT and SERVER_DIR are set earlier in the script. `warn` is a function that prints to stderr. Everything else should be self-contained. [Here](https://github.com/DMBuce/clicraft/blob/serverlog/src/lib/functions.sh#L142) is the function in context. I was gonna walk through it in pseudocode

**Questions**

1. In the `else` bit
2. The `tail -fn0 --pid $TIMEPID /dev/null` portion near the end seems hokey. Is there a better way to wait around until another process exits?
3. Just in general
4. Speaking more generally

**Disclaimers**

* \^Sorry about that wall of text
* I realize there are languages like C that are probably better suited for this tasked
* If you happen to look at the commits for the branch this is on

In DOS, tab, tab and it will cycle through the subdirs and select foobarski for you.  

In bash (and I'm guessing other Unix shells), but if you type ls f tab tab, it gives you a list of possible completions, namely your subdirectories but you have to type more characters to narrow down in the list.

Maybe there's a way to emulate this in bash.  It is one thing I like better in cmd.exe.  However, in DOS, you'll lose everything trailing your edit.  Unix shells don't do that.

1289856118.0,e6l5l,Short Guide to Custom Bash/Readline Key Bindings ,downdiagonal,13,0,1,"With Bash's `bind` builtin and the `inputrc` file it's possible to set your own custom key bindings in programs that use GNU readline. It's also possible to use custom key bindings to execute macros and commands. We'll start with Bash's `bind` builtin. The general usage is:

`    bind '""key sequence"":""macro""'`

For instance

`    bind '""\C-o"": ""&gt; output""'`

With this

`    bind -m vi-insert '""\C-o"": ""&gt; output""'`

You can also use key bindings to do a bit more complicated things like insert a ""for"" loop and leave the cursor after the ""in"":

`    bind -m vi-insert '""\C-lf"":""for i in ;do ;done\eBBi""'`

This will make `ctrl-l f` insert ""`for i in ;do ;done`"" in vi insert mode. To do the same thing in emacs mode you would use (N.B. I'm using `esc-f` instead of `ctrl-l f` since `ctrl-l` clears the screen in emacs mode. See the list of escape sequences at the end of this post.):

`    bind -m emacs '""^[f"":""for i in ;do ;done^[b^[b\C-b""'`

to insert ""for i in ;do ;done"" and then move the cursor back two words and one character. We can also do interesting things like quoting the word under the cursor:

`    bind -m vi-command '""\C-l\"""":""Bi\""\ewwa\""\e""'`

`    bind -m emacs '""^[\"""":""^[b\""^[f\""""'`

You can also bind keys to execute commands without disturbing the text on the current line. Imagine that you've entered a long

`    bind -m emacs -x '""^[d"":""cd .. &amp;&amp; echo $PWD""'`

`    bind -m vi-insert -x '""\C-ld"":""cd .. &amp;&amp; echo $PWD""'`

Other key bindings allow you to match partial history commands à la the way the ipython shell will complete a partially entered line from your python history by pressing the up and down arrows:

`    bind '""\e[A""':history-search-backward`

`    bind '""\e[B""':history-search-forward`

`    bind -m vi-command '""k""':history-search-backward`

`    bind -m vi-command '""j""':history-search-forward`

You can also set key bindings for all programs that use readline or for specific programs or even specific terminals by using the file `~/.inputrc`. An example inputrc:

    $include /etc/inputrc
    
    $if Bash
        set editing-mode vi
    $endif
    
    $if Python
        set editing-mode vi
        ""\C-li"": ""if :\ei""
        ""\C-lf"": ""for i in :\ei""
    $endif
    
    $if Ruby
        set editing-mode emacs
    $endif


# **Escape Sequences**

    \C-         control prefix
    \M-         meta prefix
    \e          an escape character
    \\          backslash
    \""          ""
    \'          '
    \a          alert (bell)
    \b          backspace
    \d          delete
    \f          form feed
    \n          newline
    \r          carriage return
    \t          horizontal tab
    \v          vertical tab
    \nnn        the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three digits)

This is an animated ""screensaver"" for the terminal.  

[Official link](http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/)

I'm going to walk through how to do it if you're new to the command line.  It's very straightfoward if you know linux.  I recommend actually typing out the commands instead of just copy-pasting.

**To Install (for dummies)**

Go to your choice of a working directory

    mkdir ~/games/

    cd ~/games/

Download the package:

    wget http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/asciiquarium.tar.gz

Decompress the package

    tar zxvf asciiquarium*

I suggest reading the README

    cd asciiquarium*

    less README #press q to exit

Test out asciiquarium

    perl asciiquarium

It may or may not work.  It depends whether you have Term::Animation perl module added.  If you do

**If you don't have Term::Animation**

Go to any directory you want...doesn't matter so I went one directory up
    cd ../

Download Term Animation
    wget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Term/Term-Animation-2.4.tar.gz  #or whatever the newest version is

Untar....
    tar zvxf Term-Animation*

Enter the directory
    cd Term-Animation*
    less README #press q to exit

The installation instructions are simple
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

You may (correction: probably) need to install another module called Curses.  

**If You Don't Have Curses**

download
    cd ~/games/
    wget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Curses/Curses-1.28.tgz
    tar zxvf Curses*
    cd Curses*
    less README #q to exit

The README is terrible...it doesn't tell you how to install.  Try 
    less INSTALL

These are the commands to install Curses
    ./configure    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    sudo make install

If successful

**Now Let's Try It**

    cd ~/games/asciiquarium*
    perl asciiquarium

Does it work?  It should.  Unless I messed up

Now turn the file into an executable
    
    chmod +x asciiquarium

and copy it to your PATH so that you don't have to be in this directory to use the command ""asciiquarium""

    sudo cp asciiquarium /usr/games/asciiquarium

Now you can issue the command ""asciiquarium"" anywhere!

**To Use**

Not much here to say.  As far as I know

The program looks better in a virtual terminal, then issue the command.

So


Edit:

Thanks all who helped. So after looking at my flow....basically the endings will always be the same but the thing that changes is the server name which is buried in the middle. I had no idea about the `$PWD` variable so I just basically manipulate that depending on the server number.

Edit 2:

This is what I ended up doing:

I put some cd aliases for the usual starting directories I use. Then when I need to change the servername (which is buried in the middle

    sd () 
    { 
        cd ${PWD/""$1""/""$2""/}
    }

Usually I'm in our backup system that corresponds with a server....

so if I'm in `/some/directory/with/servername01/bla/blah/directory/etc/named

I'll switch to another backup set with:

    sd servername01 servername03

    rexp = re.compile(sys.argv[1])
    while 1:

        exit(0)
    ' ""$1"" | { IFS=$(echo ""\0"") read -r ""$@[2
    }


Now

    mread &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;...

will set the values of the given variables to the matching groups in the first match of the standard input. If the pattern contains no groups

For example:

    $ echo ""file.txt"" | mread '(.*)\.(.*)' base ext
    $ echo ""$base"" - ""$ext""
    file - txt

I made sure that the function works well in loops (only the first match per line is used):

    $ echo ""file.txt\nscript.sh"" | while mread '(.*)\.(.*)' base ext; do
    &gt;     echo ""$base"" - ""$ext""
    &gt; done
    file - txt
    script - sh

Criticism and improvements are welcome.
Unfortunately

Edit: Made a few improvements

Edit2: 0sse's comment gives rise to this much simpler function which doesn't use python:

    # Read variables from matches of a regexp
    mread() {
        while read -r line; do

I have to read a list with comma-separated values. I read it line by line with a little c-program i wrote.
In each line the first value (before the first comma) is automatically entered into the shell and the response written to a file. 
Problem is that it just isn't working with scripts taking up multiple lines. 
Now i could tweak my program and might get it to work after some serious effort but i wondered if there is a way to simply put several lines of bash into a single line (maybe there are some separators i don't know about?).

I can't give you too much information on that, you simply do 
""ssh -p 22 name@host""
Host will usually be the IP address.  You can probably leave the p 22 out since that's the default port.  ""name"" is important since by default it will use the name you're on on your current machine.  You have to specify the name you want to login on on the host machine.  You can also enable X (GUI) by doing ""ssh -x host"".

###Original text for those interested

I'm likely going to explain this clumsily

I have the following script:


    #!/bin/bash
    
    pidPrefix=""logGen""
    
    
    checkPrime ()
    {
      if /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0|/bin/grep -wq inet;then isPrime=1;else isPrime=0;fi
    }
    
    killScript ()
    {
      /usr/bin/find /var/run -name ""${pidPrefix}.*.pid"" |while read pidFile;do
        if [[ ! ""${pidFile}"" =~ ""${$}"" ]];then
          #/bin/kill $(/usr/bin/tail -1 ${pidFile})
          /bin/kill $(/bin/cat ${pidFile})
          /bin/rm ${pidFile}
        fi
      done
    }
    echo ""$$"" &gt; /var/run/${pidPrefix}.$$.pid
    killScript
    #  echo ""$$"" &gt; /var/run/${pidPrefix}.$$.pid
       tail -F -n0 /opt/REDACTED/logs/manager.log|while read -a  i;do
        if [[ ""${i[2]}"" == ""E"" ]];then
          if [[ ""${i[7]:0:1}"" == ""@"" ]];then
            echo ""${i[0]}|${i[1]}|${i[6]}|${i[@]:8:${#i[@]}}"" &gt;&gt; /tmp/allerrors.${i[0]//\//.}.log
          else
            echo ""${i[0]}|${i[1]}|${i[6]}|${i[@]:7:${#i[@]}}"" &gt;&gt; /tmp/allerrors.${i[0]//\//.}.log
          fi
        fi
      done

The bulk of it you can ignore

 * the function `killScript` is meant to check for lock files in /var/run (excluding lock files created by the current instance of the script) and kill the pid inside the lock file. 

 * a tail is kicked off against a log file, and explain what everything does, but it's not really relevant to my problem). 

 * The goal is that this script is run periodically on cron. Every time it's run

So here's the issue. The script starts a child process

 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# bash new.logGen.sh #kick of an instance of the script`
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# ps -ef|grep [n]ew.log #in a separate terminal check pids`  
    `root     11391  7109  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
    `root     11395 11391  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
 * So now the script is running
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# bash new.logGen.sh #in separate terminal start a second instance`
 * In the first terminal the script exited back to a prompt and says `Terminated`
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# ps -ef|grep [n]ew.log`  
`root     11395     1  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
`root     14623 10569  0 16:52 pts/3    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
`root     14630 14623  0 16:52 pts/3    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
 * and now I have the child process of the script still running and doing stuff. 

So yeah

After some Googling I found you can switch stderr (fd 2) and stdout (fd 1) by using a third file descriptor (fd 3)

    { test 3&gt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;1 | read var } 3&gt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;1

Please correct me if I'm wrong in any of these points: (all of the assumptions are for bash &gt;4.0)

1) It is not possible to pass an associative array to a function
2) It is not possible to pass in more than one indexed array to a function  
3) Passing 1 indexed array to a function is only possible
  a) the array MUST be the last parameter  
  b) all of the parameters before the last parameter are mandatory

I think the first point is pretty self-explanatory. The second point is impossible, in advance, how many elements are in the passed arrays. The third point is impossible, for a similar reason, if you know your function expects 3 scalar parameters, and 1 array, you can do:

func() {
    param1=""$1""
    param2=""$2""
    param3=""$3""
    shift 3
    declare -a localarray=(""$@"")
}

But if you call it with 2 scalars

declare -a array=(a b c)  
func 1 2 ""${array[@]}""

It would lead to 'a' being assigned to $3

So

a) How can I pass an associative array to a function  
b) How can I pass N arrays to a function

1361467365.0,18yp5b,Bash Script to Update Multiple Blocklists,-pANIC-,9,1,3,"Hi

I'm using the script below to combine multiple separate blocklists into a single blocklist that Transmission can parse but I don't understand some of the command syntax at the end of the script and I have my suspicions that the resulting file isn't a 'complete' file.

I've run this under Tomato Shibby and also Mint 14.1 with different results.  Under Tomato the resulting file is not named 'extras' as I presume it to be named and under Mint the script merely downloads the files and doesn't perform any further script actions.  I attempted to debug the script using bash -x but using limited knowledge as it pertains to this level of scripting I'm afraid I'm working in the dark.  

Can anybody help me understand what this script does?

    # automatically. That default
    # http://update.transmissionbt.com/level1.gz. This script is to auto download
    # the latest or extra P2P blocklists to suppliment or replace the default.
    # All being well the script will download from the ""$URLS"" list and create a
    # file which ""transmisson-gtk"" can parse
    # ready for ""transmission-gtk"" to create a new binery file on startup.
    # If this doesn't happen for some reason the existing will be left in place.

    This is a 100% Bash script used to download imgur albums while making sure that
    the order of the pictures is retained. The script now allows for multi-file
    support.
    
      usage: ./imgur.sh [-cpsm] [file] URL
      This script is used solely to download imgur albums.
    
      OPTIONS:
        -h Show this message.
        -m &lt;File&gt; Download multiple albums found in &lt;File&gt;.
        -c Clean and Remove nonalphanumeric characters from the album's name.
        -p Preserve imgur's naming. (Warning! This will not retain order.)

    Special Thanks goes to Reddit users:
    Ihasn and Skaarj for help on the base code during the early stages.
    invisiblescars for the idea and original code for a kde4 context menu.
    
    Compatible with:
      Linux
      Unix
      OS X
    
    +-----+
    |USAGE|
    +-----+
    
    The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste
    the address bar link into the terminal.
    
    chmod +x imgur.sh
    ./imgur.sh -h
    
    If you want to use the multiple-files feature then you will need to have
    a plain text file with imgur album URLs seperated by new lines
    
    ./imgur.sh -m Imgur-Albums-List.txt
    
    Special note: If you do use the -m flag it must be the last option.
    E.X. ./imgur.sh -scm Imgur-Albums-List.txt
    
    +------------+
    |INSTALLATION|
    +------------+
    
    This is only if you want to reference the script without having it in
    the directory you want the imgur album.
    
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo chown `whoami` /usr/local/bin
    cd /usr/local/bin
    curl https://raw.github.com/manabutameni/Imgur/master/imgur.sh -o imgur

I typically work on a number of different machines and find it very useful to have different coloured backgrounds in the terminal sessions I have open to them. For example I have the production machines' backgrounds set to a very vivid red

    alias ProductionBox='/usr/bin/gnome-terminal --title mylogin@production.box --window-with-profile Production'

Recently I've become a huge fan of the [Terminator](http://software.jessies.org/terminator/) xterm emulator and in particular its ability to have multiple sessions in a single window by making use of horizontal and vertical splits. So I'd much rather use this now than have half a dozen separate gnome-terminal windows scattered around my desktop.

So what I want to do is create a list of ports being used on the local *or* foreign column (column 2 or 3). It doesn't matter what the IP is. So what I want is one line for each port used. I hope this makes sense.


EDIT 2: Here is the script that I've came up with to sort out the ports...

    while read line; do
     echo $line|cut -d ' ' -f2 | cut -d ':' -f2 | tee -a allports.txt
     echo $line|cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d ':' -f2 | tee -a allports.txt
    done&lt; netstat.txt
    sort -u allports.txt &gt; uniqueports.txt
    while read line; do
     grep -m1 $line netstat.txt | tee -a uniquelines.txt

&gt;The small gottcha is that it isn’t desirable to mess with the JPEG headers, so it skips forward by this amount – the resulting position in the ByteArray should be the end of the header, and so between this point and the EOI (end of image) the data corruption takes place.

my question is: how can one do this in bash? I have no idea.

The problem here is, as well as the number that I'm trying to extract.

In one case it might say

In another case it might say

I've been developing some CL apps in shell. Latest one (as usual) started small and kept expanding. It has a lot to do with files and directories so developing in zsh made a lot of sense due to its powerful filename globbing.  

Some of the issues that bit me the most probably could have benefited from a ""real"" programming language such as:   
   - datastructures: cannot have an array inside an array or hash  
   - passing around of arrays around the system  
 - occasionally accidental conversion of array to string etc  
   - variables are global by default unless declared local  
   - constantly hit by a space in a filename or directory name (esp when passing and changing
     arrays containing filenames)  -- the prescribed method is quite painful to adhere to  
   - calling methods in a pipeline create a new process so structures created in those
     methods don't persist (one can forget this at times

So

I'd like to know what programming language is closest to shell (bash/zsh). Is it one of perl/python/ruby or is there something else out there that would be faster while giving easy access to external commands, with of course proper datastructures and string manipulation using regexes (pref pcre), getting a single character from system with timeout.",,False,self,t5_2s4oq,,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/17mmbt/i_need_to_move_large_shellscripts_to_a_real_prog/

I know that windows share folders can be mounted on linux using Samba. However... how do I use it for my code?

Also

I'm a beginner at this sort of thing

-------------
* 1. Drive is inserted
* 2. A script runs to authenticate user
* 3. Run script to give details in file to share server
* 4. Download data

This is just a small proof of concept demo, after the software works properly.

Thank you.

This is fine up until you start using commands that require quotes - for example

&gt;
&gt; Best regards

This user has a script that runs a simulation that generates tons of data.  This script also iterates the simulation call over a long list of possible inputs

A note about my solution: There may be cooler or more elegant solutions

Here's my response:

Sure it is!

It's possible to figure out the remaining drive space with just a few
creative commands:

Here's the output of 'df -k' on &lt;hostname&gt; right now:

    $ df -k
    Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1            714893864 270782880 407796412  40% /
    none                   3048076       788   3047288   1% /dev
    none                   3058744      4980   3053764   1% /dev/shm
    none                   3058744       304   3058440   1% /var/run
    none                   3058744         0   3058744   0% /var/lock
    /dev/sdb1            961432072 602956476 309637596  67% /export/b
    /dev/sdc1            961432072 598710816 313883256  66% /export/c
    /dev/sdd1            961432072 890776364  21817708  98% /export/a
    /dev/sde1            961432072    204436 912389636   1% /export/d

I see that /export/a is 98% full.  The directory /data/&lt;user&gt;/ is on
/export/a
then I can extract that information in a script thusly:

    # Let's say that your script is writing data to /data/&lt;user&gt;/somedir/...
    dir_to_watch=""/data/&lt;user&gt;/somedir""
    # Retrieve the used drive space as a percentage
    percent_full=$(\
        /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
        | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
        | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
        | /bin/sed 's,g' \
        )

percent_full will be a numerical value between 1 and 100.  (Yes, since the OS reserves some extra space for itself that users aren't allowed to have.  You know what I mean.)

Or
can do this:

    # How many MB of space is left?
    # You can just as easily replace --block-size=1M with 1K
    # 1G, 1E, 1Z, or 1Y for different block sizes.  But
    # these are 1T drives -- good luck writing 1Y of data to them.
    space_left=$(\
        /bin/df -P --block-size=1M ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
        | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
        | /usr/bin/awk '{print $4}' \
        )

This will return the amount of free space in MB.  Then you can do a
comparison in your script to decide whether or not you have enough space
to proceed:

    # If disk is 98% full or greater
    if [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        exit 1
    fi

or

    # If disk has less than 10MB of space left
    if [ ""${space_left}"" -lt 10 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        exit 1
    fi

Of if you really want to get jiggy with it
script print a warning and wait for space to clear up before proceeding:

    while [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; do
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed
        # Wait 5 minutes
        sleep 300
        # Check disk space again
        percent_full=$(\
            /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
            | /bin/sed 's,g' \
            )
    done

or

    while [ ""${space_left}"" -lt 10 ]; do
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed
        # Wait 5 minutes
        sleep 300
        # Check disk space again
        space_left=$(\
            /bin/df -P --block-size=1M ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $4}' \
            )
    done

If your run returns a non-zero exit status on failure
check after a run to see if a full drive is the culprit:

    if ! &lt;command-to-run&gt;; then
        echo ""Command &lt;command-to-run&gt; failed""
        echo ""Checking for drive overflow error...""
        percent_full=$(\
            /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
            | /bin/sed 's,g' \
            )
        if [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 99 ]; then
            echo ""Drive is full -- this could be the cause of the failure""
            # perhaps do something ingenious here
        fi
        exit 1
    fi

And you can have your script send you an email like this:

    # If disk is 98% full or greater
    if [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        # Send an email:
        /usr/bin/mail &lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; -s ""DISK FULL"" &lt;&lt;EOF
    The disk containing ${dir_to_watch} is ${percent_full}.
    Please clean this up a.s.a.p.
    EOF
        # Die gracefully after living a good
        exit 1
    fi

Variations on the above solutions also apply.  :)

The example input log is a pipe delimited file that looks like this:

06/16/13|00:00:21.893|0|NULL|get_file_size Failed to get ready asset with data_id 105422013`

The fields are ""date|time|stringID|contextID|log message""

So, but this is where mind goes first):

        169 17023

 * Split each line based on `|` as the delimiter 
 * Sort the results
 * use `uniq -c` to get a count of each result

But the guy I work with does it like this:

    [root@mgmt02 allerrors]# awk -F\| '{a[$3] += 1}END {for (i in a)print i
    33119 4
    7900 908

    17013 350
    33048 898
    17031 841

From what I know about awk
 * He's splitting the file based on `|` as the delimiter.
 * creating an array called `a` (this seems more like a dictionary
 * If the value of the 3^rd column is already in the array
 * this is where I'm kind of lost. I get what everything after the END is doing...but I'm not quite sure. I'm sure it's quite simple

Since I first wrote this I've seen a few other solutions for dealing with the issue of managing/creating symlinks for configs in dotfile repos to their native locations in ~/. I've seen Makefile solutions, and some setups where the .git folder is right under ~/ with '*' in .gitignore (which just seems really messy to me - and I recall reading this could be dangerous with some git commands). None of them seemed to have all the features I needed so I decided to write my own solution.

I should explain beforehand

For those interested

    # initial setup of a new machine or temporarily working on another machine
    $ git clone git://host.com/user/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles; cd $_
    $ git submodule update --init       # the script can be added as a submodule to the dotfile repo
    $ cd link.sh
    $ ./link.sh                         # output a table showing current status of the managed dotfiles
    $ ./link.sh -b                      # backup any existing conflicting files (for when you're temporarily on a machine)
    $ ./link.sh -wf                     # link your dotfiles (-f to overwrite any existing ones)
                                        # any parent directories for the destination path will be created

    # optionally: once you're finished working on a temporary machine
    $ ./link.sh -r                      # restore environment to original state
                                        # any created parent directories will be removed (only if empty)

Another case: a file in your repo might contain sensitive info (e.g.: ~/.ssh/config with host aliases)

    $ link.sh -c ssh/config             # create local copy of file 'ssh/config' in your repo
                                        # commands can take multiple keys as args (none implies all keys defined in config)
    $ vim ~/.ssh/config                 # add sensitive info
    $ &lt;change made to ~/dotfiles/ssh/config&gt;
    $ link.sh -v ssh/config             # view diff of local copy and repo version with vimdiff
                                        # copy over any new settings using 'do' vim command

This would allow you to keep your ~/.ssh/config in your dotfile repo while any sensitive parts of it remain on the local machine.

The script works by reading the source and destination paths from a config file, and removed when deleting or restoring (although there are some [limitations](https://github.com/acx0/link.sh/blob/0e649679155737f90f1619aefb1d24fc9012a5e0/link.sh#L131)). As shown, all flags except -v and -u can take multiple args (keys in your config file), or none, meaning process all defined keys.

Anyway

Here are a few things I'll probably be changing soon:

* make output much less verbose - I've left it on by default for debugging
* make colour output optional in config file
* make `    ~/.link.conf` the default config location rather than the hardcoded `    ~/etc/.link.conf`
* cleanup variable scope - I believe bash variables are defined globally by default?
* add variable for the diff tool to use
* clarify in documentation that parent directory path creation/deletion will be handled by script
* ~~add support for paths with whitespace~~ - as suggested by Rhomboid - TODO: fix `    read_opt_args()` so that it preserves quotes when reading args into array (e.g: `    link.sh -w ""some key"" vimrc` parses the keys as being { ""some"", ""vimrc"" }; any ideas?

Any suggestions are welcome.

 *  each file is edited in its own terminal (from the text editor's point of view); in its own pane (from tmux's point of view)
 *  cut+copy+paste ideally uses the tmux paste buffer
 *  ideally

To expand on the first point: a problem with tabbed browsing, is that you often can't switch directly e.g. from editing a specific file to running a command in a specific terminal: you must switch from your text editor window to your terminal window, and then switch to the specific tab of interest within that terminal window. I find this two-level switching doesn't fit within my muscle memory and can break my flow, so I wish to avoid it.

Here are some text editors I've considered:

 *  **nano**
     *  can only edit a single file at a time --- which is good! (I'd run another copy of nano for each file I wanted to edit)
     *  there doesn't seem to be a way to cut+copy+paste between those different copies of nano

 *  **emacs**
     *  wants to display everything in the same terminal
     *  there is emacsclient (for using an extra terminal), and I'm back to the two-level switching problem
     *  I could try to avoid that by rebinding all the keys... but inevitably I'll miss something

It seems to be working

I'm pretty sure in its current state it wouldn't take too much to break it on another system.

Right now this is how I'm retrieving the remote directory and putting it into an array:

    while read TITLE; do
      printf ""$i.\t%s\n"" ""$TITLE""
      MEDIA[$i]=""$TITLE""
      ((i++))
    done &lt; &lt;(ssh $REMOTE_HOST ""ls -1 '$REMOTE_DIR' | grep -i '$*'"")

I know I shouldn't use 'ls' but I can't figure out a good alternative.

This worked until recently because it tries to do maths with 08 and bash gets confused about what's base 8. So I should do something like

    00 22 * * 3 touch ~/bin/Number_$((10#$(date -u +\%U)-3))

But the hash comments the rest out. So I though an escaping character would work

any advice would be helpful. Do I have to process the DOM in STDOUT to get these links? It must be easier than that.
