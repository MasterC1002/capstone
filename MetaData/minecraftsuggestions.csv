So my idea was that, that way you can fit under certain obstacles. I'll get to that in a second. Since the character is roughly 1.7-1.8 meters tall, a 20-30cm difference seems logical.

[Here](http://imgur.com/1Z7HV) is a visual example for 2m and 1.5m ceilings.

About fitting under obstacles, when you try to walk under it, you can't as the distance from the floor to the bottom of the slab in 1.5m. Now how about, when crouching, fitting underneath of that slab was possible. Eh? A decent example for that, so it isn't completely useless, is if you have a mineshaft. Those are usually 2 blocks high. If you put a half slab on the floor or ceiling of each individual shaft, however

* Grass with a certain light level has a small chance of randomly spawning a flower

Summer

* Lower chance of snow in taiga and tundra biomes

Autumn

* Leaves on trees change to autumn (orange, brown, etc) colors and can be collected as blocks of those

* Piles of leaves can spawn under trees


Winter

* Chance of snow in any biome during winter

* Small lakes have a chance of freezing

* Slightly higher chance to spawn wolves

I'm contemplating adding a latch block of some kind to Minecraft

What I was thinking of adding was a simple memory cell block. It would have one input (S) and one output (O) similar to the repeater block, but when C=0 then O keeps its old value regardless of S.

The placement would be similar to the repeater

* Adventure mode Break/Place block system: that is
* Spectators cannot interact with entities: Entities cannot be hit, etc. Entities also pass right though the player, without interference, including arrows, minecarts, etc.
* Spawners do not activate from a player in spectator mode.
* Redstone is not set off
* Natural mob spawns are unaffected by spectators. Spectators can witness hostile mobs spawn and despawn a block away. Spectators do not influence the mob cap.
* The spectator cannot influence the GUI of chests/etc., hotbar, and possibly their health/food/breath/armor bars.
* Spectators mode inventory is Survival like

***What this can be used for -***

1) PVP events

2) A server's default gamemode. Creative servers can have spectator mode be the default join in

3) Map makers, if controlled right (Or perhaps as an after-completion gamemode..)

4) Hardcore worlds can be viewable in spectator mode after dying in it. Thanks [Muniosi](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/117irm/gamemode_3_spectator_mode/c6k1jiu)!

1345298686.0,yfewk,Seasons and Seasonal Benefits.,DeathCop,288,59,37,"I realise I'm not the first to suggest it but feel this request has been dormant for a while.

Heres how I imagine it working. It would only affect certain biomes and each biome may slightly differ depending on its climate. A season could last between 20-30 minecraft days as to allow a good period of time for any benefits to be exploited and changes to be appreciated.

Ill list the biomes and the changes ""I"" imagine they could have per season: 


These are the ""MAIN seasonal biomes"" I imagine and would dictate certain changes in other biomes less effected"" 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Plains-Forest-extreme hills-swampland:**


**Spring**- Animals naturally breed every so often
              wheat and trees and plants grow much quicker
              Flowers and long grass would naturally grow
              High chance for brief rain


**Summer**- Very rare chance of rain but when it does it usually is stormy
                  Crops grow at average speed.
                  Wheat crops drop extra
                  The day night cycle slightly shifts so there is a couple more minutes of day and fewer of night   (effecting all Biomes)


**Autumn**-  Tree leaves change colour to more of a red brown (excluding pine/spruce trees)
                 Oak trees occasionally drop apples naturally (like how chickens drop eggs)
                 Fruit crops drop more and higher chance of trees dropping saplings when their leafs are destroyed
                 long grass drop more seeds
                 Higher chance of rain and very rarely snow 


**Winter**- High chance of snow (settled snow would melt in the spring)
              bodies of still water would freeze over (also melt in spring)
              Leafs could change colour and texture to a brown and appear more stick like (excluding pine/spruce)
              animals are slightly harder to breed (take more wheat or something)
              slightly less fruit crop drops
              slightly less seeds from long grass
              Long grass and flowers have a chance to die off (excluding player placed)
              Day night cycle shift so there are a few more minutes of night and fewer of day (effecting all Biomes)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the main changes i imagine and they would mainly only effect these biomes. Other biomes would be effected differently as other biomes are more season specific.

heres how they could be effected slightly differently.


**Jungle**: Treated like spring through all seasons. More rain during winter period (no snow)


**Desert**: Treated like summer through all seasons besides the day night shift dictated by main seasonal biomes. More rain during spring period (Rainy season)

(**EDIT**: Thought dust storms could occur in the winter. Could be purely aesthetic but maybe also harm the player on higher difficulties.)


**Taiga**: During spring and summer it is treated as spring and during autumn and winter it is treated as winter.


**Ice Plains**: Treated as Winter all year round. Excluding the day night time shifts that would still be dictated by the main seasonal biomes.


**Mushroom**: Treated as autumn but has no chance of snow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Im sure I have missed some important seasonal changes that could be added so I'll edit this post if anyone points them out to me. This is just how I imagine seasons would be implemented. I realise what I've suggested wouldn't be a quick and easy addition but I strongly feel it would add both an enjoyable aesthetic change, I feel, would add a new level of challenge. Also Seasonal effects could maybe be amplified in hard and hardcore difficulties so it becomes harder to survive in winters (etc).

Sorry for the length and complexity of my suggestion.


**[Short version]** Add seasons. These would effect certain biomes in different ways. Each season would add benefits/drawbacks. Aesthetic changes in certain biomes. Maybe make seasonal changes alter in magnitude depending on selected gameplay difficulty.

This thread is to discuss potential GUI updates that would benefit vanilla minecraft. Please feel free to suggest your own ideas or mock-ups.

**SIGNS:** [Mock-up illustration](http://i.imgur.com/6WF4Ivd.gif).

* It is now possible to click anywhere on the sign to edit text. No more having to delete entire lines to fix spelling errors!
* A ""finished"" sign may be edited after the fact as well by right clicking on it to bring the GUI back up. [Servers may need some sort of command to turn this ability on or off

**BOOK AND QUILL:** (most of these functions are already built in

* Click on a button to activate

* Players can click anywhere in the book to make text changes (this includes selecting sections of text with the cursor to delete/apply italics/etc).

* There is a ""jump to page"" feature.

* Copy-pasting text works.

* You can sign as whatever author name you want (if this is problematic for some reason

**PAINTINGS**: [Mock-up illustration.](http://i.imgur.com/inhoYa9.png) (or, medium, and large."")

* Place a painting and right click on it to bring up the GUI.
* If you are using a texture pack
* Paintings ""expand"" like normal (bottom left to top right) but any painting too large to fit the area will not be toggleable.

**MOB SPAWNERS**: (creative mode only) [Mock-up illustration.](http://imgur.com/uwDI7vL)

* Place a spawner and right click on it to bring up the GUI where you can choose which mob spawns.
* Mobs could be sorted by category ""Passive/Nether/Tameable/etc."" or selected using the search feature.
* User [jwbjerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1dcqzs/gui_additions_and_updates/c9p7ybh) suggests that instead of a GUI

**NOTE BLOCKS**:

**Terrain:** Minecraft has some pretty cool sights, and make ravines deeper, plus this enables more layers for ores. I could go on, but I'll leave you with [this](http://i.imgur.com/A5zbu.jpg).

**Ambience:** Minecraft could sound nicer. Crickets to chirp you asleep in swamps

**Biome Transitions:** This has been mentioned before; deserts next to tundras? Whaaa? We need transitional biomes. I'm talking desolate boreal forests that never snow

**Oceans:** They are lacking. They should be dangerous in the colder parts with sharks that threaten your dives for resources,"" we should make it so you really say ""Tammy! Come check it out! I found a f#cking ocean!.""

**Biomes:** We need more of them, and most of all, different biome-specific resources and buildings. Many extra biome mods have illustrated this point well. [Here](https://github.com/ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL/wiki/List-of-Biomes) is a few pictures from the XL Biomes mod, although some of the screenshts contradict my earlier suggestion for transitional biomes.

**Extras:** Biome specific villages that look *good* including underground lord-of-the-rings sequa mining villages, biome specific mobs (not just ocean), also [fireflies](http://i.imgur.com/DxZcE.png), critters, and birds to make the world feel less lonely and desolate.

I also suggest Alt+Right-click instantly replace the block in the world, delete, place, delete, place... when you change your mind about a block type. Just hold down Alt, and the block gets a red bounding box, and then when you right click

**EDIT 3:**
Commenters have brought up the issue that this change would make it more work to clear off the workbench.
Here's how i think it should work-- ideas taken from the conversation below:

* The crafting table GUI gets a new button labeled ""Clear All"" which returns all items to your inventory (if you have room).  This would be useful for regular crafting as well when you want to start over with a new recipe.

* When you leave items on a crafting table they are displayed above the top surface, or on them.  If there is a block above the table, the items remain in position, but are not visible.

* If a player is using a crafting table

* Breaking a crafting table drops all items.

I've seen several suggestions, and each only addresses half of the problem.  This suggestion is designed to solve the most annoying issues in a consistent way, while adding the minimum stress to the computer.

* 1) When a chunk is unloaded

* 2) Right *after* a chunk is reloaded or a player wakes up, player health regen, or furnace cooking would be automatically advanced by the amount of time a chunk was inactive, or the time a player was asleep.

* 3) EDIT: I now think #3 is likely impractical.
Processes that take a random amount of time such as crop and tree growth

* 4) This method would not work very well for simulating iterative growth like for vines or mushrooms. They would get at least *one* chance to reproduce

* 5) Fire spread, etc. would remain as is-- not calculated while the player if gone or asleep.  If Mojang can make any of these things work while the player sleeps or is away without a performance hit --good for them.  While i'm no Java coder, i'm making my best guess about what is realistically possible.  There's not much point in raising support and hopes for an impossible suggestion.

One aspect of this that's lost is the ability to have fire burning on the sides and the bottom. This made for additional aesthetic choices that are no longer available.

-Could pose new challenges in the nether (albeit slight). 

-Allows for additional aesthetic choices. 

**Disadvantages:**

-Some might feel ever burning fire upside down and on sides goes against the logic of Minecraft. 

-The aspect of only burning on top forces an amount of decision  to be made of how best to use that aesthetic. 

**Examples of potential use:**

-Burning ceilings. 

-As a light sources that can be placed on the underside of a block. 

-In challenge maps or adventure maps

* Coral as a somewhat rare underwater surface block that can be mined with a pickaxe and placed like any other decorative block. 

* Shipwrecks as ""temple""-level rare zone spawns. At the bottom of the ocean, and skeletons - maybe a spawner - and a treasure chest with booty, weapons and random potions (i.e. ""rum"").

* Sunken Villages as ""village""-level rare zone spawns. Also at the bottom of the ocean

Finally

* Compass points to where it was crafted rather than your spawn point, etc.)

2) **Fermented Spiders Eye + Arrow = Poison tipped arrows**. Let's say one eye does 16 arrows


3) **Music played from jukeboxes pacify mobs**. A great way to neutralize a dungeon! A superb way to sheer sheep!! A splendid way to torch a cave spider spawner!!! A great way to work on your farm without animals running away! Mobs will ""snap out of it"" if attacked while under the hold of the music. Otherwise they just kind of freeze on the spot and nod their head up and down to the tune. If I wanted to go really deep on this one I'd say each disc has it's own effect


4) **Saddle a squid to ride the tides!** Same deal as pigs


5) **Let us sell our damned Lapis XD**...double that of gold seems fair


6) **New villager: Doctor/healer**: Buys dandilions, spidereyes, gold (rare). Sells: lvl 1 Potions, lvl 2 Potions (rare), glistening melon, netherwart. 


7) **New villager: Artisan**: Buys: Ink sacks, dyed armor, dyed wool, paintings. 


8) **New Villager: Engineer**: Buys: redstone, powered rail, pressure rail, dispensers, jukebox (rare). 


9) **Tamed wolves roam villages** Makes sense right? Steve isn't the only person in the chunk that has a dog. Surely. Plus the poor squidwards need all the protection they can get. These dogs will be tame but not controllable. Villagers will hate you if you hurt them


10) **Update achievements with every update to encourage checking out new features**. Eg: Not If I See You First (kill a mob while invisible). 



11) [An old post of mine about Sun/moon phases](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q3uap/neat_suggestion_special_sunmoon_phases/)

Now instead of winding our way down to the mine (and back up for that matter), 4 planks for the stand and a whole stack of string (spider string fiber is actually really strong, i saw this thing on discovery once). Can descend 64 meters. 



13) Two pieces of leather



14) **More Golems!!**. I sure do love my new desert village


15) **Hows about that blue flower in the handheld version**. Ya


16) [A potion of youth](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/qi0w3/spiffy_idea_potion_of_youth/) (also from an old thread of mine). 


17) **More discs, continuous play, repeat song, etc. If a jukebox is destroyed it drops it's contents in the same way a chest would. 


18) **New ""Villager"": Hermit** (rare). Lives in extreme hills biome in a cave at the top of a mountain. His cave is a simple 5x5x5 hovel with a bed and single potted plant. Often has a cat. Buys: sugar. Sells: Diamond


19) **New Mini-Bosses** The thing that killed the miners


20) **Oil**: Found in those ungodly cracks/spaces in the bedrock. Can only be gathered with buckets. 1 bucket can smelt one stack of cobble. Highly flammable...so you can toss the bucket on something and then add a spark for an almost lava like effect. But unlike lava it'll eventually burn away like wood.

Well

The way farming works now, wait five minutes, then punch it, then get a wheat. It doesn't matter if you use a Wood or Diamond hoe, it's all the same. What I was thinking is that the better your hoe is, the less weeds are in the farmland, and the faster your crops grow.

As a bonus

* Wood: 5 minutes

* Stone: 4.5 minutes

* Iron:3 minutes

* Gold: Hard to tier

* Diamond: 3 minutes

Now I bet you're thinking

Each tier farmland should have a distinct look

* Wood would be a sort of sloppy tilling

* Stone would be slightly neater

* Iron would be the same Farmland that we have now.

* Gold would be the same texture as Iron

* Diamond should have more ruts than the current texture

1363651004.0,1ak4pt,The much desired underwater content,Jazeboo,178,27,41,"**-EDIT- a few people have been saying that this is way too much for an update - we want to 'spice it up

**Thanks for the feedback guys!**

Everybody knows it. The ocean is boring as shit. Boats look wimpy as hell. The only fish we have are the fish in our inventories and item frames. The only mobs in the ocean are squid

So many water 'feature' suggestions have been made in this sub. There's one on the front page as I write this

**First

Obviously things like fish, I think, two types of fish: **'real' fish and 'aesthetic' fish.**

*'Real fish'* would be real entities

* Here are some examples of fish: [[1]](http://imgur.com/uN6Y9zU) [[2]](http://imgur.com/bBRNENZ) Source: /u/jadezx

* A possible item to be introduced could be the fishing net. Basically, it would be caught, just like fishing with a fishing rod. 
* Hopefully fish will come in different colours and shapes and sizes

*'Aesthetic fish'* would be fish that aren't entities: rather, manta rays, and crustaceans to roam the ocean floor. That is, of course, if they are not turned into mobs themselves.

Also turtles. 

**Aggressive mobs**

* Jellyfish: these would only appear in deeper waters. They might look like blue slimes with tentacles. Obviously
* A boss: most probably a kraken. Read more below. 

**A way to swim faster/breathe longer/see clearer**

Basically

**Plants!**

Coral reefs pls. More colour in the ocean. Different types of coral, two types: 'effect' coral, 'brewing' coral, and 'aesthetic coral.'

*Effect coral*: possibly effects that either hinder or boost the player's abilities, or maybe poison you. Coral that slows you down as you swim by, coral that shocks you as you pass, coral that acts as a sort of 'black hole' and pulls you towards it. 

*Brewing coral*: exactly what it says on the tin. Coral that can be harvested and made into potions, brewing coral could be used for enchantments/enchanting books.

*Aesthetic coral*: like aesthetic fish

Also seaweed/kelp: these would act like vines

* [Example.](http://imgur.com/x6SYQbw) Source: /u/jadezx

**Boat improvements**

Currently, it is very boring and not very aesthetically pleasing.
The ability to customize boats, as one user puts it, 

*'What is much more entertaining is having a boat that doesn't randomly smash on the shoreline due to bugs and lag. Lets get what we already have working before we start adding in boats we build from scratch.'*

If, the question is how these boats would be made. Obviously you couldn't simply build a giant pirate ship and have it sail, that would be to OP. Instead, we could have something like different parts of the boat built in the crafting table and then placed in the water, where they would become larger and probably entities, to avoid farming of useful blocks.
The boat would only work when all required parts are put into place. Also


**-EDIT- as I said in the comments:**

&gt; I think this would be too gamebreaking as well as near-impossible to implement. How would the engine be able to detect what's part of the ship and what's not? How would it move like current boats do? It would only be able to move in 1 direction
For this reason


**Suggested by /u/androidyl: enchant boats with unbreaking.** and by extension

**The Kraken... or

The Kraken would be the boss of the ocean. It would only appear when you have your own *large boat* (see above) and would have tentacles that you would have to kill individually. Think something like [this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Cf2vTxJgA) (sorry for bad quality.) 

* During the fight with the kraken
* The kraken would have a weak spot: its eyes.
* When killed

**Underwater villages**

With hostile merpeople. 
What else can I say?


That's all I have now

1369300199.0,1ew72r,Make Villagers behave more like actual NPC's and less like walking squidward vending machines.,uioz,176,24,26,"First of all

**TL;DR:** Give Villagers the ability to talk

Ok

The only problem was that player-made towns with Villagers always feel like ghost towns

So

I thought about the following:

**Giving Villagers dialogue lines**

Every Villager should have 5-10 lines of dialogue at hand. These  would refer to his profession and to his environment. They could appear in speech bubbles over their heads

 It should be possible to edit them with NBT editors

Conditions could be:

* It's raining
 
 This could cause villagers to say something along the lines of ""This rain is good for my crops"" or ""Come inside

* It's getting dark

 Villagers could respond to this with ""Oh no

* The Sun is coming up again

 The response to this could be a sipmle ""Good Morning""

* Attacking or killing a Villager could cause his fellow Villagers to back away from you and say ""Get away from me!"" or ""Please

 Maybe these lines wouldn't show up in creative mode

They also could have simple lines referring to their profession

""My crops are growing well"" for the Farmer

""The work with the forge is hard

""Say Praise!"" for the Priest. (These are just a few

Issue number two would be the aimless wandering. This isn't as much of a problem with vanilla villages, be countered by:

**Defining multiple paths for Villagers**

To do this without external editors

To define a path for a villager, and the game would calculate a [spline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics\)) which would then be the path. To close a path, return to the villager and right click him again with the pathfinder. A villager could have multiple paths, and randomly choose from them.

**EDIT:** Thanks

Paths could easily be stored within Lists containing compound tags

There also could be dialogue lines to be displayed when a specific waypoint is reached. Furthermore

There are also some smaller things which could greatly improve the feeling Villagers create:

**Giving them the ability to sleep in beds**

This would require some minor changes to village generation

**Not all Villagers are traders**

This would be only for mapmakers, which would default to 1 (meaning the Villager is a trader)

**Adding the Invulnerability tag to Villagers**

Minecarts seem to have it

That's all. I know, but it would greatly improve the game's atmosphere.

Depending on what you are doing at the time, a wither skeleton spawning etc.) A traditional use for this throughout gaming history is having random events happening. Like the weather, these events would come and go at random and would force the player to adapt, even for a short period of time, to the new circumstances. A more familiar example would be Terraria having Goblin Invasions and ""Blood Moon"" events every so often after a certain point in the game has been reached (E.g. The Goblin Army won't invade if you haven't acquired the musket yet.)

Obviously the possibilities are almost endless as to what you could do but I would like to hear some ideas from everyone for random events. A couple that I like are:

A flock of birds targeting your farm areas. A message pops up sating something to the effect of ""Your crops are being eaten by crows!"" and you have to run and kill all the birds before they destroy your farm. The birds could just use a similar flying pattern to the bats and just fuck up all your plants.

In the humble days of Beta, decided to revolutionize the game of Minecraft in a single update known as 1.8: The Adventure Update. Within this update many overhauls were done, many blocks added, and just plenty of new additions and tweaks overall.

One of these overhauls was in relation to the terrain. Rather than just the three original biomes of Desert, Notch decided to add more. The biomes now included forests, plains, extreme hills, taigas, ice plains (tundras), swamps, rivers

However, which are sub-biomes within biomes that were more hilly than the standard terrain. This slightly fixed the high variation problem.

Again, but the eye sore still remains. And this suggestion is how I think this should be fixed.

Now, or even shared transition biomes between different biomes. That's a little wordy, but here's some examples:

Plains / Forest -&gt; *Savannah*


**In regards to the shared transition biomes between different biomes:**

***Of course

1365710415.0,1c5nbs,Cubic Chunks: Eliminate x-ray hacks and reduce lag! Infinite world height! [from Minecraft Forum],badasspiggy,165,27,42,"The following post was made by Calacbolg on Minecraft Forum:


Overview:

With the introduction of the Infdev update, chunks eliminated the need for the entire world to be generated at one time - Minecraft could generate new chunks as needed.
However, the laggier it becomes to generate. The same principle applies to loading and simulating a chunk. It is for this reason that Minecraft is limited to 256 blocks in building height.
The solution to this issue is to change the type of Minecraft's chunk system. Currently, height can be completely eliminated as an aspect of lag.


Technical Details:

It might sound too good to be true. Many of you are probably wondering how this could possibly function correctly without wiping everything clean
Part of the beauty of this systems lies in the fact that it leaves much the same. A few glaring issues

Data Storage:

Currently, or 1024 chunks. This allows for much more efficiency in chunk handling than just simply storing each individual chunk. Under this system, however, 323 chunks would be way too much and very inefficient. Instead, the new '3DRegion' format would contain a 163 cube of chunks, for a total of 4096 chunks, which is 4 times the number of chunks in current MCRegion files. However, and requires the same amount of bits(4) for positional metadata as the MCRegion format(After compression). After conversion
As an optimization utilized for efficacy in filesize and elsewhere, but removes a variable(But usually large) value of data from each 3DRegion.
Biomes are currently tied to entire columns of blocks inside linear chunks. Due to the impracticality of the same system under cubic chunks, which in turn allow for such things as subterranean, oceanic, and other height/depth related biomes; as well as very intricate, but entirely randomly generated structures created through simple to complex parameters of biome placement. At places where biome transitions would be accurate, at biome borders(Which will inevitably slice through copious amounts of chunks due to the biome map created from the world seed), chunks containing the border will be identified as a technical biome named 'transition'. 'Transition' biomes simply smooth biome transitions through taking properties of biomes of surrounding chunks

Coping with sunlight:

This is one of the glaring issues that requires a total rewrite of something. Quite simply
The 'Heightmap' system actually consists of many individual heightmaps, ignoring air. There are two kinds of heightmaps, the per-3DRegion type(Every single 3DRegion file gets its own 16 by 16 chunk heightmap of the highest blocks within it), and the global heightmap(Created by compiling blocks from the per-3DRegion heightmaps into a global grid of the absolute highest block at each XZ coordinate pairing), which there is only one of.
The only data stored to the blocks inside these chunks is their block type and their Y-Coordinate. By comparing the Y-coordinate of a block to the global heightmap, to accurately detect the amount of sunlight decay for use in sunlight calculations.
The heightmap is updated at many turns, chunk loading, and block updates. If some of the blocks in the global heightmap are removed, and no suitable replacements exist in loaded chunks to replace the remove blocks, single chunks of per-3DRegion heightmaps are loaded downwards until a replacement is found, skipping empty heightmap chunks. This system means that no matter what, you can only experience the lag of one 162 block chunk loading for every 16 vertical chunks you've generated. The conditions to turn such a system laggy would be very precise and exceedingly improbable, but yet one block every 16 chunks.
Upon initial world generation, and still have their shadow exist.

Overall lag reduction:

Now that I've explained how this works, the view distance is a sphere, not a cylinder. That alone reduces the handled data on an order of around 33%. Alongside the empty chunk optimization discussed above, the lag reduction could actually be on an order of one third.
On SMP, and reduces client-side lag. It also has the side-effect of nearly completely eliminating X-Ray hacks.

Special-Case Chunk-Loading:

As just said, things like Redstone circuitry can load adjacent chunks on latent ticks with little impact. This means you could build circuitry larger than ever before. Could this result in a lot of lag? Yes, it could. However, normal redstone circuitry can already do that.


Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: This is impossible.
A: No it's not. Additionally

Q: Won't people in PvP/Raid/Anarchy servers just build a sky base up at Y1000+ or a cave base down below Y-1000 and never be found?
A: Servers can and have always been able to designate a maximum build height(Check Server.properties). With the implementation of this system, bedrock layer, and lava lakes to generate at(And above) that layer like they usually do now.

Q: Will this affect Redstone at all?
A: Yes

Q: Won't this break existing worlds?
A: No! Existing worlds can easily converted by dividing each MCRegion file into 4 pieces

Q: Will this affect mods?
A: Yes...and no. It's hard to say. Parts of mods that rely on chunks

Q: Couldn't a player fall into unloaded chunks if chunks don't load fast enough?
A: No, which aren't going to be plentiful as you're falling. Even in such cases when loaded chunks would be plentiful, the client can easily pause your fall until new chunks are loaded.

Q: What happens when sand or water falls into an unloaded chunk?
A: What happens when a minecart or mob moves into an unloaded chunk? It freezes in place until such a time as it can continue moving.

Q: Won't something that falls into the Void fall forever due to empty chunks being generated infinitely downwards?
A: No. In such places where the Void should be, chunks will simply not generate, and normal Void-like effects will apply.
In the case of Superflat worlds, with layers below the bottom-most defined layer copying the parameters of that layer and generating with applicable decoration parameters. Existing Superflat worlds retain their Void but this may be edited via NBT tags which will allow infinite downwards generation as normal.

Q: Will this affect terrain?

By filling a cauldron with water, the cauldron will be filled with boiling water. The cauldron will make a bubbling sound similar to lava and bubbles will appear and rise in the water. Now that the water is hot, you can add items (using Q) and begin making soup.

  Judging by what's confirmed for 1.6, and FREAKING UNDEAD HORSES! Ok, I know those haven't been implemented in the snapshots yet, but they're in the game code and will probably be added soon. Anyway, villagers had it really hard before, but now they'll be basically extinct unless they are made a lot stronger. Here are a few things that would help:

1. GOLEM? WE HAVE A GOLEM?

Almost every village in a regular world, 2/3 of what it is now, so about a quarter of villages will have golems. The rest won't need them, because...

2. FIGHTING BACK!

Ever found it strange that villagers don't defend themselves? They're strong enough to build villages,and butchers whose job it is to slaughter animals all day, but when they're stuck in their house with a zombie breaking down their door, they just stand there and let it kill them. Suggestion #2 will fix that. First of all, there should be a new kind of villager, called the warrior. Warriors will have swords and occasionally armor (I see zombie villagers in armor sometimes, why not living ones?). At night, they'll help out the golem with patrolling the village

Oh

1 1/2. DAMNIT

Ok, when they're getting hurt badly by something that's not a mob or player, will get pissed and start randomly rage-punching and breaking lots of blocks around them.

3. WIZAAAARDS (JUST KIDDING

So witches, including my own Unofficially Official History of Minecraft, they lived in villages until they were kicked out for being evil/batshit insane. What about the potion-using villagers that aren't insane? They should be in villages too, and be called druids. Their house could have a cauldron and brewing stand, and they trade potions/potion ingredients. They behave like witches, throwing potions and stuff, but the difference is they heal themselves and other villagers

4. WE NEED MOAR BABIES!

Villagers breed more


That's it, they're just people who come to trade occasionally. The way villagers are right now, it seems that they spent all those years building a civilization, fighting off zombies, and generally being badasses, until the player comes and they become stupid sheeple that need to be protected every night or they go extinct. So anyway, that's my suggestion. Hope you like it.

Currently the ways of automatically distinguishing mobs is done by their volume and by exploiting their AI (though not always 100% reliable). However

* Separation of all kinds of mobs.
* Separation of zombies and villager-zombies.
* Detection of armor on mobs and which type (leather is lighter than gold).
* Weigh how much there's in a donkey's chest (plus the donkey itself).
* Weigh how much the player is carrying (plus the player itself).
* Weigh how many players are standing on a pad (easy analog group voting).
* Measure a slime's size.
* Measure if horses
* Estimate how much a villager is carrying (and thus know about how many trades he offers).
* Measure if entities have received a nametag.
* Measure if an enderman is holding a block.
* Measure how many mobs are in a holding area.

Additionally

* Differentiate between the baby and adult versions of animals.

1359514524.0,17jdft,Slightly better village generation.,IplayMContheHolodeck,143,20,14,"Most villages currently look the same, and certain bugs in houses. Not only that

Where they spawn: Villages are hard to find, they should only spawn near water sources. As in lakes, rivers, and oceans. However, they should also spawn in any biome, making them easier to find. And slightly more realistic.

Architecture: Village architecture is always the exact same. What's more, after checking what biome the well is in, it picks from a list of types of architecture, what type of architecture the village has. Different biomes have different lists. However, the types of houses and their purposes remain the same.

Damage: The point of village helplessness is so that the player is either the villager's ""knight in diamond armor"" or the person who condemns them. So wouldn't it be cool if, when the village is generated, the houses are damaged. Roofs appear to be collapsed, windows are broken and boarded up, the paths might be deteriorated. Obviously there would be limits to this, so the entire village isn't destroyed when generated. I personally would enjoy having to fix up the village, and decide between fixing up the old boarded up shack

Better roads, or the gravel roads fallen into caves. So what I suggest is that when a house is on water, it is supported, above the water, by pontoons (logs). Roads become docks, and are made of wood, and also supported by logs. Also, house will just make supports that go to the bottom

Villages have a tendency to spawn near each other: This would make sense. But also, maybe even war (although villagers are currently peaceful). However, I don't want all that stuff yet, I just want villages to have a tendency to spawn near each other. As to how it could be done, maybe ""habitable areas"" randomly spawn near water sources. Villagers have a higher chance of spawning in these, so villages will often spawn near each other. There is one other thing it could lead too though....

Mixed architecture: As you read earlier, it has a chance of having mixed architecture, which combines multiple types of architecture. The types of architecture will always be that villages architecture, and the architecture of nearby villages.

Finally, how damaged the village will be, and the chance of it being a mixed village. Please note, this is talking about the age of the village already, before the player found it.

1356820688.0,15n6t6,Brew “Thick” Attribute Potions with Lapis,ChadGarion25,149,22,50,"So far

**Lapis creates “Thick” potions that can be consumed multiple times in a single bottle at the cost of Magnitude and Duration**

***


 *Logical Explanation*

***

Just like you thicken a gravy with starch or a desert with heavy cream, but Lapis is better because it is inorganic (fits the theme with Redstone and Glowstone dust) and has no mechanical uses (only aesthetic dye and decorative block uses). Whether this is realistic or not is up to you but this is how you can rationalize it from a logical perspective.

***

*Mechanics Details*

***

Creating a “Thick” potion is just like creating a “Splash” potion but you use Lapis instead of Gunpowder. So to craft a Thick Fire Resistance potion, instead of having a potion I drink once that lasts say 4 mins, I have a potions I can drink 3 times that last a min each time consumed. It’s balanced by the fact that the total duration of each partial consumption (3 mins total) is shorter than the standard potion’s duration (4 mins). This is just a hypothetical example; exact durations, magnitudes, even number of uses can be adjusted to prevent abuse.

Tracking potion uses can be done one of two ways. Consumption of a potion reduces is durability just like a tool or weapon. When the durability runs out

***

*Practical Applications*

***

Due to the inability to stack potions together in your inventory

* You have created a nether base. To keep players out, a single fire resistance potion you can drink 3 times would be much better use of your resources and save 2 inventory slots at the same time.

* You’re at half-health from a recent creeper explosion. Another creeper is bound to be nearby. You can’t wait for regular regeneration but you don’t want to waste a whole instant-healing potion to restore your health. You use a thickened healing potion instead to restore a smaller amount of health but just enough so another creeper blast won’t kill you.

* You are in the process of navigating back to your house with a fresh load of diamonds in your inventory. You are on a PvP server though and a player jumps you at the mine entrance. You keep a single potion of strength for just such an occasion and consume it before trying to fight them. But instead of attacking you, it would have had multiple activations between the mine and your house.

***

*Conflicts with Stacking Potions*

***

I will admit this feature would be less useful if potions were ever made stackable. Partly because it’s no longer a space saving feature

However

***

*Conclusion*

***

Pros – 

* Saves inventory space

* Efficient for a variety of situations

* Gives a mechanical use for Lapis

* Fits existing game mechanics and conventions

Cons –

* Conflicts with adding stackable potions as a feature

* Debatable whether or not it makes the game more “fun” for a majority of players

* Adds a host of new potion ID’s to Minecraft (I’m under the impression that when the new Modding API is released this isn’t going to be a big deal. I’m not a programmer so I don’t know)

---

Basically I am suggesting this simple addition; **A ""Progressive"" game mode

When you first are creating a world, and Hardcore; ""Progressive"". It would be just like hardcore mode, but every day, the mobs will get ever so slightly stronger. 

Due to the way Minecraft health works, it would be half a heart every X days. For instance, let's say X would be 10 days. For the first ten days, all mobs have normal health. But as time goes on, after 100 days, they have 5 hearts more health than when you began. Not much, but considering how long most worlds are played

Not only will mobs have more health, explosions become larger over time (at a slower rate than health/attack). Also, creeper charges slowly become shorter and shorter, until they literally explode upon the start of their fuse. Again, this is deep into the game - probably years of in-game days.

Among health and attack, etc. all will eventually walk faster and faster, until one day you can't even outwalk them, and very far into the game, you won't even be able to outrun them and must think and plan very, very carefully. 

**Mobs see you from further away** as time goes on. Plan carefully, and you just might stay alive.

And finally, most of the zombies you see will be decked out in full diamond -- Of course, this is years of in-game time down the road. Mobs with equal power to the player!

Now for some benefits that would come from this new game mode!

* Players would need to be more hasty when starting out    
* The challenge of the game will grow steadily
* Completely optional
* Assigned per world; not changeable without mods
* Players need to think more before charging into battle
* Mobs provide that threat that SSP never gave
* Time and days are already saved
* Takes nothing away from the normal game

1351539182.0,12aivy,[Suggestion] Use valid beds instead of valid doors for creating and building up villages.,CasualPenguin,151,29,39,"**TL;DR:** I suggest villagers are paired to beds and that they also return to the proximity of their bed each night. This also includes village population being based off of beds.
_______________________

**The Problem:**


I'm trying to build up a large village on my server right now and I'm hitting all the standard problems anyone has faced when working on villages:

- Villagers tend to crowd into one building at night 
- This leads to distant buildings being completely abandoned
- Unattended buildings can be considered inactive and stop counting towards villager populate
- Need to have 3 doors per villager


The list goes on but you guys get the point.  There are solutions for redistributing villagers, hiding doors, etc etc but they all really screw with the aesthetic of the villlage.

**The Solution:**

Why not have Villagers be instead tied to a bed?  For each *valid* and available bed a villager can be spawned.  Once spawned a villager is tied to that bed.  Each night he will return to the proximity of his bed.

**Something I'd like you guys to weigh in on:**

What is a valid bed can be calculated many ways.  Currently valid door calculation seems to confuse anyone who hasn't done a good amount of research into it.  

The check for sunlight in front of and behind doors isn't something that would directly transfer to deciding if a bed is valid.  I feel like this is partially done to discourage villager farming (which we've seen Mojang has tried to fix further in 1.4).  My solution is instead the same check to see if a bed is safe to sleep in over night is done to consider if a bed is valid and once a bed is owned by a villager it is considered occupied well past when/if it's owner dies.

A huge upside to that solution is that sunlight would no longer restrict the creation of mountainside/underground villages.



Let me know what you guys think, and preventing abuse of the trade mechanics.

Well I personally thought it'd be cooler to have actual seahorses so I made this suggestion
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

***MOBS AND ENTITIES***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

**Seahorses:** So the seahorses would look like [this](http://imgur.com/gcRhFUj). And this is the [seadragon](http://imgur.com/wF8Jp9X)

As you can see they are rideable. They have to be tamed, made up of seaweed. This is [the seaweed forest biome](http://i.imgur.com/WgP6Q31) Seahorses can take you underwater at greater speeds than just sinking to the bottom so if sunken ships are ever implimented (I've seen a lot of posts about sunken ships), the seahorses can take you down faster. 

**Sharks and dolphins:** Everything is explained [here](http://imgur.com/GjuEsYc) 

**Fish:** The [fish](http://imgur.com/alLuUf7) I came up with was based off the raw fish item. It will drop raw fish as usual

**Leviathan:**
So I decided to make up an aquatic boss mob that I would like to see in Minecraft. The Leviathan. Of course lots of people would like to see a Kraken, and yes it will hunt you down incessantly once you touch the water. I'm guessing this boss has to be created or summoned like the Wither. Maybe ringing a special unbreakable bell in the underwater temple? Hmm...I like that actually...and then you'd hear a roar and it'd be best if you got the fuck out of there quick before that shit cornered you! Well, what do you guys think?

**Ships:**
I think ships would be a pretty cool mode of transportation. It allows players to stick together on long overseas adventures, the navigator can right click to fire cannons (represented by the window panes on the lower part of the ship) on the right, and left click to fire the cannons on the left side (there will be a cool down time of 1 minute). Cannons deal 15 hearts of health and explode upon contact with entities or blocks (any stray cannonballs that hit the land will cause an explosion and damage the terrain). The navigator uses W to move forward, A to TURN the ship left and D to TURN the ship right (no strafing ships). S slows ships down as ships cannot move backwards. If two ships are close enough, players can jump aboard and try to take the other ship. When a ship is depleted of health, it begins to sink. Players are dropped into the water and anything in the chests of the ships is lost. You cannot build on ships.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
***STRUCTURES***
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

**Sunken Ships:** 
So I made a quick mock up of [sunken ships](http://imgur.com/a/zEhF8). So the sunken ship is pretty much a regular ship, or masts, with a big hole blown into the side with TNT (at least that's how I built it :P). There are two chests. One in the captain's cabin and one belowdecks. The one in the captain's cabin has a Captain's Log item. The one belowdecks has random loot. Coral and seaweed spawn around it as you can see, but the amount of coral and seaweed should vary between ships. Also sharks could spawn more abundantly near these shipwrecks (maybe a shipwreck could be it's own biome to make only sharks spawn here?). 

**Underwater Temples:** The [underwater temple](http://imgur.com/a/gNo56) is kind of a rare structure. In the underwater temple is a bell that
______________________________________________________________________________________________
***BLOCKS***
______________________________________________________________________________________________

[**Coral:**](http://imgur.com/a/JYdxQ) It's coral. It breaks as easily as glass. It gives off light (but only underwater). It's basically the glowstone of the sea. It comes in many bright colors (but I felt like only doing pink). It should definitely be more detailed then what I did. It grows in random clusters like glowstone

[**Seaweed:**](http://imgur.com/5r53Y4y) Seaweed grows up to 5 blocks in height. Seaweed is found in seaweed forests (and around sunken ships or underwater temples). Seaweed slows you down a bit as you can get tangled in seaweed IRL. Seaweed forest biomes are where seahorses are found.

[**Bell:**](http://imgur.com/TJjq5lq) The bell is only found in underwater temples. It is unbreakable. When rung
______________________________________________________________________________________________
***ITEMS***
______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Spyglass:**
So I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1isiql/telescope/), causing everything you can see to appear enlarged. It is used by right clicking, and when you right click again the player puts it down. It is held like a [bow](http://imgur.com/a/45pOY). One more [image](http://imgur.com/JsK1S6v).

**Captain's Log:** It is a written book titled, mixes 'em together (in a way that makes sense of course), and leaves a nice little story detailing events on the ship, such as how a crew member tried mutiny, or maybe saying the food supply was running low, or even the cause of why the ship sunk in the first place. There would be a separate text file to create random names of the captains.

**WARNING: This does get quite technical at times. To my knowledge
##Introduction

I am not a fan of the current biome generation system. It's cool

##Current Issues:

- Deserts and jungles generate next to ice biomes.

- Biomes themselves are monotonous and mostly feel the same. Taigas are always hilly and at a certain height

&gt;Right now I think the reason biomes are boring is because they are clearly defined and internally very uniform. If you've seen one desert or ocean or forest you've seen them all.

(⇧ thanks **BlueRavenGT** ⇧)

- The current system is unable to generate decent looking mountains.

**The current system:**

Biomes are decided according to a *biome ID* that is assigned to each column (also known as an (X

##Possible ideas:

1. Overhaul every single biome like jungles are currently. This means adding new trees, but frogs and alligators would be perfectly at home in swamps; birds would add huge atmosphere to forests. 

2. Decouple biome height from biome generation. Currently, using a ""terrain ID"" - that is not stored in a block, and is separate from the biome ID: hilly, flat, highlands, lowlands, rivers (see below), canyons, canyons

##Mountains:

I will describe this as a series of steps for how to generate a mountain. I will add images later.

**How to generate an interesting mountain:**

1. Choose a *mountain summit* - a (X, that represents where the top of the mountain will be. This is similar to the village generator, which starts with a village center, which is where the well is generated. 

2. Choose how large the mountain is (radius)

3. Generate 3-5 *spurs* from the mountain summit. Mountains are not perfectly conical, the spurs can be connected to other nearby mountains. **This may be unclear - post a comment if you have a question!**.

4. Generate (some) rivers between the spurs. Between the spurs in a mountain are draws, a river will be found, but not always.

5. Generate a *heightmap* for the mountain. A heightmap is simply a map which assigns each column a height.

6. Incorporate the heightmap into the Minecraft world. A simple way to do this is to simply move all terrain upward according to the heightmap

7. Replace all biomes above a certain height (~112

**Old explanation

Mountains! Not just any mountains. How can these be implemented? Sadly, with a *mountain summit* and a *size* where all terrain is moved up according to a generated mountain pattern. This happens before cave generation or ore generation. The mountain area will have its own biome category (see below) and will have fringe biomes (see below) with whatever is surrounding it, and the mountain will generate with spurs and valleys, and perhaps a volcano with a dungeon inside it. The edges of a mountain can be composed of a huge amount of biomes, which will all blend into mountain biomes the closer they get to the summit.

##Biome variants:

*The point of this is to increase the variation that biomes display (and reduce the associated boredom), as with the current generation system. Categorizing the biomes allows the game to have many, many more biomes without it becoming a total mess.*

**Biome variants**, while some will be more common.

**If this is unclear to you

Example:

**Temperate (forest and grassland)**: standard forest, pine forest, dense forest (with more trees), sparse forest (with less trees), redwood forest, magical forest, **corrupted forest** with traces of dark magic (think of the eldritch ruins in Thaumcraft 2) with more endermen and corrupted mobs, poplar forest, plains with pine and oak trees. Temperate beach.

**Desert**: desert, savanna (with acacia trees), savanna (without acacia trees), Grand Canyon style desert with hardened clay/similar block, sandstone desert, desert with dead trees, desert with palm trees, desert with clusters of evergreen trees (think Afghanistan

**Tropical (forest and plains)**: jungle, jungle with straight trees, jungle with thin trees only, jungle with twisted/tilted trees, jungle with huge trees, jungle with a huge canopy which does not let sunlight through (the sky is GREEN!... but not really), tropical forest, mangrove, tropical beach. Don't forget mosquito repellent.

**Arctic/Icezone**: ice plains (Tundra), ice plains with dead trees, ice forest with dead oak trees, ice ""jungle"" with huge, twisted trees, ice jungle (think of the ice sphere in Crysis), redwoods, ice ""swamp"" with huge

**Nether**: there are over 9000 ideas for nether biomes, nether forests? (some otherworldly plant that may or may not look like a tree will have to be added for this), nether wart gardens, perhaps different styled caves with different nether blocks. And perhaps a special one that generates in a 8-10 block wide splatter pattern around nether portals, covered in grass and flowers. The Nether really must be expanded, the whole place looks the same. 

**River**: river, rapids, completely frozen river, river with ice on edges, river with floating tree logs, stream, creek, shallow slow river, river with island/sandbar in the center, waterfall

**Mountain** (found on mountain areas): rocky (stone and gravel, rocky grassland (grass with rocks/boulders jutting out), rocky forest (grass with rocks jutting out, and small clusters of trees), mountain forest (mountainside with rocks jutting out and dense forests), mountain jungle (mountainside with rocks jutting out and dense jungle), mountain ice forest (mountainside with rocks jutting out and ice forests

**Volcanic** (found on volcano areas): all of **Mountain** plus: volcanic plain (""plains"" made of black volcanic rock, when a volcano is generated, lava ""rivers"" will also be generated, and anywhere near or on top of them will be volcanic-type biomes.

**Fringe** biomes would simply be a mixture between each biome's properties. For example, the fringe would have the mean (average), which is 0.65. A more complex system calls for a linear blend between these features between categories. Fringes are between categories (e.g. Arctic and Forest), but can also be between biomes within a category too. Larger differences in temperatures/humidities result in larger fringes.

**Weather** will be detailed in a further suggestion. The relevant point that will be described here is that it should no longer be tied to the biome, and dependent upon season.

##Downside:

World generation will be broken for current worlds. This can be added as a new primary world generator (standard, legacy standard, legacy large biomes), keeping the old one for legacy purposes.",,False,,1367128119.0,t3_1d7xk0

1358979804.0,175f46,Villagers rarely spawn with a pet wolf or ocelot that follows it.,TheRandomnatrix,134,18,9,"**Main idea**

When a villager is spawned by breeding(not eggs)

Killing them could cause the village to dislike you more

**Upon owner death**

They could either:

-1: Become normal wild wolves/ocelots like usual.

-2: Stay tamed forever and either wander the village or stay in the place where their owner died(as if waiting for them to come back)

-3: Be tamed by the nearest villager within a radius. 

-4: Wolves could become 'feral'

Failing the third option they could do one of the others in order to make sure they do something. I'm not a huge fan of the first option because it could be used to farm wolves/ocelots to an extent

**Additional ideas for ambiance**

*Have butchers give a bit of meat to village wolves/ocelots nearby. It won't cause them to breed

*Have village children make the wolf/ocelot 'sit' for a few seconds

**Reason for adding**

It would give some ambiance to villages. It doesn't make a lot of sense why they wouldn't have domesticated animals


**Ease of adding**

Not entirely sure how feasible it is from a coding standpoint because I'm not sure how wolves store their owner data

Obsidian tiles. Obsidian is a material with a lot of potential in minecraft

Here's some textures i created of what Obsidian tiles might look like. (shown at default 16x

[Image of 3 possible texture for obsidian tiles

^(Note: I give permission to mojang to freely use the textures i made should they implement my idea and want to save a bit of time making the texture.)


**Now

Tiles made of obsidian of course. The have many desirable qualities, and could have quite a few uses to the clever redstone builders out there.

**How does one acquire obsidian tiles?**

Craft them. The pattern would be simple. Put a single block (or stack) of obsidian on the crafting grid

**Won't the ability to multiply your obsidian like that unbalance the game?**

Not at all. While there are many advantages to obsidian tiles

Not to mention the fact that obsidian is not by any means a rare material

**Pros:**

* They will multiply your obsidian supply for the purpose of building.

* Finally a black construction block

* They're are just as resistant to explosions as obsidian blocks.

* They can be crafted into slabs or stairs.

* They are more refined looking

* They can be mined much faster than obsidian blocks. (lets say... 2-3 seconds with a diamond pickaxe?)*1

* Unlike obsidian blocks

* It would basically make obsidian a legitimate building material.

**Cons:**

* They won't work for building nether portals

* They can't be used to make enchanting tables

* They can be mined much faster than obsidian blocks. (lets say... 2-3 seconds with a diamond pickaxe?)*1

* Unlike obsidian blocks

* A diamond pickaxe is still required to mine them in survivial mode.


^(*1 Being that they can be mined much faster

^(*2 Though this would allow you to make things such as sealable cannons, stick with proper obsidian.)

So basically what you have is a [key] item, like doors, pistons or a redstone repeater to extend the signal to make even greater uses of it.

Thing is, make it so that when the key is in the block the block becomes powered as if it was receiving a redstone signal (wich is already a mechanic of the game) and bam! You have a sexy key mechanic so we can make a zelda/doom style dungeon, inovative puzzles, and much more!

But what if something HAS been cooked already? It is tedious having to check every furnace in a big furnace room just in case something is in it.

SOLUTION: A simple ""not empty"" visible texture indicator would save time when you have multiple furnaces in a room. This way you don't need to check them all (or have a great memory) to retrieve your already-cooked items quickly.

One new oven front texture would do the job (""furnace_front_full"")- a simple generic red blob (like warm metal) or possibly a grey blob (like a shadow) visible inside the front to show the oven has items in it. 

This would only require a quick adjustment to the oven textures and probably only a few lines of code; easy and makes the cooking process go a little more smoothly. 

Maybe it might be necessary to also make a ""furnace_front_lit_but_empty"" texture as well

**Enchanting**

The functionality of the Enchanting system is great. Spending EXP for enchants that are randomly generated is fun and I would not change that. Making enchanting easier or more customizable is not needed

**What is wrong with armor enchants?**

There is one enchant that far surpasses all others, and it also takes all the fun of specialization right out of the game. 

I would never wear fire protection gear when given the alternative. If you are getting your enchanted gear from exp grinders

In fact, it is situational, and most importantly, it adds a fun element to the game that really makes you think!

**How could armor enchants be improved**

Stop having one enchant that far surpasses all others. If one enchant is the best

I propose adding one more enchant: Melee Protection, unarmed, etc and then seriously nurfing protection(all).

In fact, I can either wear protection IV everything or I could have fire prot IV boots, projectile prot IV helm, melee pro IVt chest, and blast prot IV legs.

That is two completely different sets of gear with the exact same outcome. The immediate benefit of this is that I never feel like I wasted my time when I get an enchant other than protection IV. This makes it so every piece has the potential to be a great part of a set

Another major point: this system allows for situation specific gear builds. Under the current system

In the proposed system

If I'm going to the nether

What if I wanna grief noobs? They probably don't have TNT or Fire Aspect gear so maybe I'll just wear 2 pieces of Melee Protection and 2 Pieces of Projectile.

The point is that I have to think about what I'm doing depending on the situation.

**The concern with weapon enchants**

Same thing, and then two less useful enchants that cost exactly the same amount to create. Smite is really only good for pve and bane of arthropods is for really specific situations.

My favorite enchants are actually knockback and fire. They are cool utility enchants that add strength to your weapon without just increasing your damage output. Also, and exciting. We already have an enchant that makes you do more damage. Why do we need 2 more enchants that do exactly the same thing but not as well?

**How to improve weapon enchants**

I thought long and hard about this one. In another thread I suggested a pvp only enchant like smite for players. Upon reflection though

I feel strongly that the true solution is just to eliminate smite and Bane of Arthropods all together and replace with with another utility enchant: Sunder Armor - an enchant that increases the damage you inflict on armor.

A lot of people suggested either changing smite and bane to status effects because more damage is redundant

There is no effect like sunder armor in the game. It would be a completely brand new addition. Also

Would I use it for PvE? Probably not

Would I use it for PvP? Maybe. Depends on a lot of things. Maybe I want to steal his gear

Also

Again

**Concerning game difficulty**

There is a significant number of players who actually like the current system because the less powerful enchants make the game harder. You are unable to create the best gear whenever you want, if you are a stat nut, any enchant other than the best is meaningless to you. 

Despite the fact that balancing the enchants, the changes I propose would actually make the game slightly harder. Protection(All) as it is now simply would not exist. That level of protection would not be available to you. At the same time, every single piece of enchanted gear would become that much more useful. 

**Anvils &amp; Naming Issues**

Making highly enchanted pieces of gear hard or impossible to repair is fine. It has been made pretty clear by the creators that they do not want you using one piece of gear forever. Unfortunately

*One: Some highly enchanted items cannot be named.*

Why? If I have a Sharpness V Fire II Knockback II sword

The current system makes it so I can either name my subpar items

A name is an aethsthetically pleasing addition to the game that we can all get behind.  It adds a fun RP element and a lot of novelty. I even support having a cost for it

*Two: Some pieces can be used forever

If I have a protection IV piece of armor

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

People spend a lot of time grinding so they can enchant their gear. Many of us do not want to make the game easier. The random enchanting process is fun because you have to keep trying to get what you want. But

Also, such as 3-7 levels of experience, because it stops people from naming every little thing and ruining the novelty of it, but the current system is unbalanced and frustrating.

So here are a few ideas from worst to best:

5. **Luminence:** Rather simple, as a light source. The use for this is somewhat aesthetic; it basically is used instead of torches or lamps or glowstone and would blend in more with normal lapis blocks.

4. **Hostile-mob repellant:** I've always felt lapis had a somewhat royal/mystical feel to it (just my opinion) and that it should act that way to mobs. **NON-PROVOKED** hostile mobs would ""respect"" it by avoiding anything surrounded by lapis lazuli (used like dust)

3. **Mob Trap:** Basically #4, would become unable to leave the boundaries of the dust. This could be used as a more efficient boundary for a mob farm. (Players, when encircled, will still be able to cross the boundaries, and flying mobs are not affected, nor are teleporting endermen)

~~2. **Lapis lazuli tools and armor:** Since lapis is somewhat common, and enchantability slightly below gold. The armor would be as durable as gold, or slightly more, and the protection level of gold, too.~~

1. **Signal Block:** Crafted with the same recipe as a beacon block, redstone would make red, iron would make white, lapis makes royal blue, emerald makes green, and diamond makes light blue. The could be used in SMP if you are working with a group of others and you need to signal them (ie: Green means everything is OK, yellow means that there may be an enemy inside your base, and white means to stay outside because a threat is too big)

**Whales**

First off, and a column of three strings to the right of it. You throw it at your target and once it's stabbed into the mob you're holding the rope attached to it. The mob can then drag you around freely. Meant to be used on whales and other watery mobs who can swim faster than you, but if you're a daredevil you can try using it on a ghast or ender dragon and see how long you can hold on.

Now, but if you start a fight with them they'll become very aggressive. They'll open up their mouths and try to draw you inside, and if that doesn't work because your boat is fast enough they'll dive and then rise out of the surface again to capsize your boat. 

After attacking it for a good while, letting it drag you to wherever it's headed. You have to pull back on the rope a bit the whole time, instead of just barely holding onto it, because otherwise the whale will pull you down below and wreck your boat. After a while it'll rise up again, giving you another chance to attack it. Lather, rinse, repeat.

The reward for all this hard work and labor? Stacks (or half stacks) of whale meat and oil. The meat is twice as good as beef

**TL;DR: A whale boss / mini-boss that would be the biggest mob in the game

The rest of my ideas aren't nearly as hefty

1. Jellyfish. They'd come in the same range of sizes as slimes, the rest the tentacles and stingers. Jellyfish would mainly swim straight up or down with very slight angles away from it, always upright. They'd come in two varieties: Friendly, and poisonous, the difference between which should be clear enough. For the poisonous ones, if you swim through or touch their tentacles, you'll get stunned several seconds. Not very good underwater. With both jellyfish you can touch the top of their heads without being harmed. I don't really know how to classify them in terms of neutral or passive. Maybe ultra-passive. If you attack them they won't even bother to swim away. They'd drop slime balls

2. Marine fish come in big schools roughly the size of giant slimes. You can pick them off one by one with a fishing rod

4. I already suggested this earlier and it was received rather well

3. Villages that are near the ocean or near rivers spawn docks on the water. Dockworkers would also spawn, boats, harpoons) and actual fish and fishy products likes pearls, whale stuff, and ink sacs. 

4. Palm trees! This is only tangentially related to the ocean, only within a certain distance from water, and only in beaches and deserts. The distance increases with the size of the water in question but stops increasing at a certain point, letting beaches have palm trees spread out all over and desert oases or rivers have small more tightly knit groups of them. They'd drop coconuts, obviously enough, which can be drunk to replenish health or used as a potion ingredient. 

That's pretty much it. I'm not including ideas like sharks, while I'd definitely love them, they've all been explained and suggested in ways that I can't really improve on.

1372077662.0,1gyrdr,Map &amp; Quill: A Way of Marking Routes On Maps,TheRegularHexahedron,117,18,6,"Here's an idea to draw routes on maps

Crafting a map with a feather and an ink sac would create a ""Map &amp; Quill"". A map and quill works almost exactly the same as a map

The difference is that when you hold a map and quill, so you can put it away to interrupt the path, and then pick it up again later to continue the trail or draw a separate trail elsewhere.

The trail's color would vary depending on your altitude, yellow, and orange as you go higher up, and being written as red at very high altitudes. This would allow you to draw cave maps, since people could see your path underground and estimate what your general altitude was at each point. (P.S. the shades used would be slightly different from the map's landscape colors, so there's no worry of a green line getting swallowed up by grass, or a blue line of an underground tunnel not showing up on the ocean.""

When you're done drawing paths, and make as many copies as you want. You can also craft a Trail Map with a feather and ink sac to turn it back into a Map &amp; Quill, if you want to add more trails.

Map &amp; Quills and Trail Maps would share the same landscape data as the map they were created from. If the landscape changes, all created from the same map and sharing the same landscape data but showing different paths.

Well

---

So now into the suggestion! I would like to see a new option under more options tab. This button would say the following; ""Ore Generation: Classic"". When clicked, and regional. I will go into more detail of each setting below.

**Classic**

Classic ore generation is exactly how it is now. Veins are small

**Large Veins**

This setting, the veins of ore are around **four times larger** than classic, but also four times as rare. When you find a vein of coal, you could mine there for quite a while before running out and needing to find a new one. In this generator type, finding a vain of ore is a good thing, not just something you'll pass up since there are so many. It gives more meaning to find a single vein of ore. 

Of course

**Regional**

This is one that I've wanted for a really long time. Instead of all ore types just mixed together in any given location, this generator type would be massive fun. Instead of setting up branch mines wherever someone feels like it, you would need to prospect to find a mineral rich area with the minerals you need, then set up some sort of mining outpost there. This encourages building settlements in mineral rich areas, exploration, and realism to the game (Of course, it's only one generator type! You wouldn't have to use it).

Now I'll explain a bit more. This would be exactly like large veins mode, lets say you found an area with an abundance of diamonds (which would be more rare than finding areas rich in other materials). The materials in above layers would generate exactly like in large vein mode, but be less frequent. At diamond level, diamonds will be more plentiful.

Imagine this; on an SMP server, have an abundance of iron supplies. A different town, over a naturally diamond rich area, would not have as much iron material, but they would be very strong with diamond gear proven they use proper mining methods. They may develop slower due to lack of better tools at first, but overall they will pick up and become better than the town over iron.

---

**TL;DR: Two new ore generation options; ""large veins"" for larger, for ores abundant in some ares while lacking everywhere else.**

A) Glycerin: Glycerin would be a creeper nest only liquid block. It would be yellow in color and could catch fire, if say, glycerin were set in the nether, it would run like water, but if it hit lava, or the stream was ignited, there would be a rapid spread leading to the source block which would burn off as normal. Glycerin would, be a median point of lava and coal in terms of a furnace fuel. The furnace would burn a bucket of Glycerin for 64 items (I just like the idea that it'd be rounded out

B) Sulfur: Sulfur would be a mineable block, but the color would be yellow. The block would look like flint, but yellow, drop say, 1-2 per block? Sulfur would have 2 uses, the most important use being, combined with coal it creates gun powder. Say, but the sulfur would take the place of the gunpowder and the coal

When placing a bucket of glycerin in the center of the crafting grid, a bottle, like a splash potion that would act like TNT, only more powerful in terms of block destruction. The ground would have to leave virtually no drops of anything hit by the bottle. This would cut down on server abuse and discourage over using it regardless. 

The cave itself would just have to be pretty creepy. Mossy cobble, or more so than the temples. Perhaps an actual nest made of obsidian? If you did make a nest of obsidian you could put the spawner underneath it and it would be more difficult to get at it. Similarly, I would think that the generation would have to be below block 40, like slimes. That would decrease encounters with them too early for player to deal with them. 


I just thought this would be a cool addition to our minecraft world. Something random


~EDIT~

So I did a small mock up of the original idea. I used gold ore for sulfur, where it can make the creepers, but not be blown apart by explosions. Also (obviously, but) the lightsources are just there so I can show you, it'd be dark when you first entered.

I have a few points to address:

&amp;nbsp;

**Good PvP enchantments.**

---

This is one of the things I hate most about Minecraft at the moment. My clan on my server has a full double chest dedicated to shitty enchanted armor. We have loads of projectile, Fire II and protection IV. Those are the only usefull enchantments for PvP. 

Why? We all know that the mobs in Minecraft are way to easy, this is just a good guide).


Yes


Another thing about the enchantments for armor is the fact that protection IV is the same as projectile

&amp;nbsp;


**Anti-griefing measures.**

---

Although I know that most of the Minecraft servers in existence don't allow griefing and have anti-griefing mods, (don't grief a city if there's a shrine dedicated to your clan, etc.) but a lot of 12 year old kids hear of our server and just attack a city armed with stone pickaxes and have bed nearby to respawn and start again. Yes, I know this is inevitable but Mojang could at least *try* to stop this. The addition of the Witcher in the latest snapshot is a ridiculously easy way grief a city. Just build a witcher, log off, log on a few hours later and look at the destruction the Witcher caused. Mojang should start thinking about this when implementing features. I have the feeling their main focus is single player, which gets boring after a while (at least for me).

&amp;nbsp;

**A new fighting system:**

---

At the moment, click click click click, S, space, click click click click.""* You just try to hit your opponent as often as possible. There is not technic in hitting your opponent at all. The function of blocking (by clicking RMB) is a weak attempt at make it more interesting. I usually forget about that function anyway. I see no one using it. Ever. What I suggest is a sword fighting mechanism a bit similar to how it is in the to-be-released game [Chivaly: Medieval Warfare \(Which is now on kickstarter\)](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1711512107/chivalry-medieval-warfare?ref=category)

If you move your mouse from the left to the right while you click

&amp;nbsp;

**Last but not least: anti hack measures:**

---

At the moment

&amp;nbsp;

I guess that's about it

&amp;nbsp;

1373133481.0,1hrars,A better horse breeding scheme.,LordTocs,107,14,4,"So after finding out that horses have different stats I set out to breed myself the ultimate horse. But I found that I was ""plateauing"" or generating lower quality horses. My ranch started to look like a glue factory. So I began to wonder how stats were passed to children.

So I went and found the [code](https://github.com/Bukkit/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityHorse.java) or at least I hope its the code...

More importantly:

		//Health
        double d0 = this.a(GenericAttributes.a).b() + entityageable.a(GenericAttributes.a).b() + (double) this.cL();
		//15 - 30 half hearts.
        entityhorse1.a(GenericAttributes.a).a(d0 / 3.0D);
		
		//Jump strength 0 - 2?
        double d1 = this.a(bv).b() + entityageable.a(bv).b() + this.cM();
        entityhorse1.a(bv).a(d1 / 3.0D);
		
		//Move speed
        double d2 = this.a(GenericAttributes.d).b() + entityageable.a(GenericAttributes.d).b() + this.cN();
        entityhorse1.a(GenericAttributes.d).a(d2 / 3.0D);

So for the obfuscated java impared... **It generates stats for a new horse as if it had spawned and averages those with both parents.**

This makes it mathematically difficult to breed a better horse. Like REALLY difficult. Lets suppose you wanted to breed yourself a tank-horse with 15 hearts (30 health). Unless you have two horses with 15 hearts already I'm fairly certain (unless health is rounded up in which case this example is flawed) then you CANNOT breed a 15 heart horse. 

The average of three numbers can never be greater than those three numbers. The only hope of generating a better horse is that the random stat component is near perfect and will slightly weight your horse up the scale. But its also hard to measure these slight increases in stats. For movement speed I've managed a crude speed test but its no where near accurate enough to decern minor speed differences in horses.

So I have two competing suggestions for better horse breeding math.

1. **Per stat choose a random parent stat and average it with the random one. This creates a punnett square kind of feel to the numbers.**

1. **Per stat choose a random parent stat and offset it with random numbers chosen from a [curve](https://www.google.com/search?q=x%5E4). (Big offsets rarer than little offsets)**

Scheme 1 will still plataeu at max stats but at least let you generate better horses more easily.

Scheme 2 could be harder to tweak so its not over powered but would let you if lucky generate a max stat horse.

Additionally: Since its easier to find better stock stats by finding spawned horses this encourages players in a competitive server ecosystem to comb over all the horses instead of breed their ideal horse. This makes it more difficult for a new player to join a server and have an equally good horse.",,t5_2s3oo,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1hrars/a_better_horse_breeding_scheme/

Well I suggest adding a fattening up effect like the one in 2.0 (though not as silly)

If you think about it

So here's how it would work: Use wheat to breed pigs like normal. Get baby pigs. Feed baby pigs blocks (bales) of wheat to make them gradually grow. Similiar to breeding, and if slaughtered they drop the usual 1-3 porkchops. However, you can continue to feed them and make them fat. They'll grow slower and slower, up to a maximum size. At max size, they'll drop 9-12 pork chops.

I'm thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 feedings to grow baby pigs to the current adult size

* **/radar:** Checks for players in a specified radius. 

 **Example:** /radar 4. Sends off a pulse if someone comes close to the Command Block. Useful alternative to pressure plates/tripwires.

* **/bud:** Probably the most useful one. Checks if any block touching the command block is updated

* **/clock:** Checks the time and sends off a pulse at certain times. Can take multiple inputs. 

 **Example:** /clock 0 12000. This would send off a pulse at sunrise and sunset.

* **/checkinventory:** Checks the inventory of players within a certain radius for certain items. Takes a radius input and an item id input

 **Example:** /checkinventory 5 267 1.  This checks if players within a 5 block radius carry one iron sword. Useful for quests and classes in custom maps.

* Perhaps the mob should begin to walk towards the player when it hears the whistle rather than teleport. The AI is probably not smart enough (that's why pets teleport)

I propose adding a ""dead leaves"" block that works like snow (i.e. a thin layer). Anything directly below a live leaf block has a random chance of getting a layer of dead leaves.

As in real life

Dead leaves would prevent the spread of grass. They'd also have a random chance of ""decomposing"" - in which case they'd disappear and change an underlying grass block into dirt.

Thus, would gradually gain a floor of leaves and dirt. A deforested area would gradually be taken over by grass.

My guess is that coding this would be very straightforward

OPTIONAL FURTHER ADDITIONS
-A crunching sound underfoot would dramatically improve the atmosphere in a forest.
-Obviously the dead leaves would integrate well with a ""seasons"" update. There could be a particle effect for leaves falling
-When harvested, and the leaves would make an excellent compost ingredient.
-Dead leaves could affect the growth patterns of mushrooms.

Maybe a block of sand could also occasionally spawn in the center as if the children made a sand castle, and I'd imagine that would be easy to do with entities and whatever. Also, this would probably be limited to normal villages, as desert villages are kinda already in a desert.

http://i.imgur.com/9WfDt9X.png

Let's get started shall we?

=== **Actual need for different foods!** ===

First off, or only breed one type of animal, I feel this would lead to a potato famine. But I wouldn't know. I'm an alchemist, not a nutritionist!

=== **Mining with protein!** ===

I have discovered, and chucking it into an awkward potion, I have made a potion that can make my coal miners work at a better efficiency! And, erm, I suppose you can corrupt the potion as well with a fermented spider eye...

=== **Swimming with the fishes!** ===

I figured this one was a no-brainer, you can create a potion that allows you to breath water, just like our scaled friends! Just, don't try to breathe air under the effects of this brew.

=== **Mario and mushrooms!** ===

While studying an Italian plumber, you too can reach the sky!

=== **Extract the Properties** ===

Now, I figured, ""Why not?"" and decided to mix the two. The result was a potion that allowed to take less damage when my coal miners attacked me.

=== **Turn out the lights** ===

Here it is: the corrupted version of a Night Vision potion. I can't really take credit for this one. All I did was add a fermented spider eye

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion

--------------------------------------------------------------------
In all actuality, we just don't have the potions for them. Also, more reasons to use different foods, so, yea. I'm kind of just rambling now. Er... is that a cat trying to get in my window? Shoo, cat! Away with thee!

2. Trapped Chests - Trapped chests are less noticeable than pressure plates

3. Gold Pressure Plate and Spawner - A gold pressure plate would give only items the ability to activate the pressure plate, due to their drops having the potential to land on the pressure plate.

Here a couple of reasons of why it could be imo a nice addition and why it somehow makes sense (*well I mean for the game but probably a bit less for everyone's health bar*):

* **[Balance reason]** Currently when you try to [break an horse](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Horse#Taming) you have a certain chance of success, but to be honest even without food it's only a matter of seconds and few attempts before a horse is tamed and that leaves to the food ""boosting"" feature  a very little use aside the role play; **tldr** *to make food more useful during the breaking process*

* **[Difficulty reason]** It's true that looking for a horse takes some efforts but as I already said breaking one of them is conversely really simple

* **['It's realistic!' reason/excuse]** The horse throw you when he's annoyed so obviously he wouldn't do that in the gentlest way and maybe even kicking you in the process;

* **[Lame 'It's realistic!' excuse/excuse]** You fall from his back so you could probably suffer some kind of fall damage (it's however true that an horse is only 2 blocks high and damage till 3 blocks are negated to players).

* Luck I, etc... Higher enchantment, higher chance of getting double from one item. (I.e. Put one Iron ore in, get two ingots out. Etc..) Like the fortune enchantment

**Chests:**

* Storage I, etc... Storage I gives 1 extra line of storage space Storage II gives 2 extra lines of storage space, and so on.

* Blast Resistance I, it can withstand explosions from creepers, tnt, etc... from a certain radius (yubyub96)

**Boats**

* Endurance I, etc... Less likely to break when colliding with land and other things. (SheiraTiireine)

* Boats Speed I/II/III - should be obvious (deathtopigeon)

**Minecarts**

* Speed I, IV, V - Make your Cart's base speed higher than usual. (EdibleBrains)

**Enchantment table**

* Luck - Gives better chance of multiple enchantments on an item. (deathtopigeon)

* Seer - Gives the ability to read actual enchantments. One time use (Zatheos)

**Crafting table** 

* Craftsman - chance to craft without using some materials. (each material gets a roll to see if it's used, 15%) (deathtopigeon)
 
**Fishing Poles** 

* Lure I/II/III - catch fish faster (deathtopigeon)

* Fortune I

**TNT** 

* Power I/II/III - bigger explosions (deathtopigeon)

* Fortune I, useful for Mining. (EdibleBrains)

**Buckets** 

* Containing - can be used to store/dispense 2x the amount of liquid (deathtopigeon)

**(Sticky) Pistons**

* Strength I

**Some Cons:**

* After a certain amount of uses the item loses it's enchantment

* Boats implement a health bar system before they break. More durability than wood

* Only able to enchant 1 by one. (Lytespawn)

* 5 Item limit. (You may only have 5 Enchanted chests at one time

**Creeper Head:** Gives off blast resistance when worn. Also, damage, etc. The radius for where mobs become alert to your presence is reduced by one or two blocks. Good for PVE and PVP.

**Skeleton Head:** Since skeletons are snipers, but Optifine uses it. Also adds a very small power buff to arrows shot.

**Zombie Head:** Zombies take more hits than most mobs

**Wither Skeleton Head:** A better resistance to the Wither effect

**Human Head:** This would be droppable from killing someone in multiplayer as a really rare drop, drop chests, etc OR by suicide farming. The perk here is that when you wear it and press E, the usual inventory HUD pops up, however an extra button is featured which gives an entire list of all the crafting recipes for every item when clicked, a sort of useful feature. The 2x2 crafting grid is now replaced with a 3x3 crafting square, as if you were opening a workbench. Also, it doesn't take damage points

*Heads which should be added into the game as rare drops as well-*

**Ender Heads:** A non-pumpkin blocking way of being able to look at the Endies without them getting all pissy at you. Also

**Blaze Head:** Since blazes are pretty dangerous, but less than it normal does, and lava wouldn't kill you as quickly.

**Spider Head:** Wearing one of these would give you a jump boost and increase your fall damage tolerance

**Cave Spider Head:** Less susceptible to poison damage

**Zombie Pigman:** Allows you to attack zombie pigmen without pissing off the horde

**Slime Head:** Allows you to swim faster in water. Holding shift lets you sink faster into large bodies of water

**Cow/Sheep/Pig/Chicken/Mooshroom Head:** Increases food saturation

**Sounds:** Each head would make its own sound when worn and the player damaged. For example, you moo like a cow does when damaged. The human head would make the OOH noise that Steve made in previous versions of Minecraft.

*Some points-*

**But some of these heads aren't shaped like human heads! How do you expect to fit a chicken head's skin onto yours?** It's not really that hard, Spiderhead, etc.

**Some of this stuff makes armor enchants and potions USELESS!** The effects these heads would give would purposefully be made so that a potion or an enchant would always give the better alternative

**But don't you think it makes the game too easy to have all these drops added for every mob?** All of these would have a low spawn rate, the drop chance isn't affected by weapons with Fortune on them, so there's never going to be an advantage through enchanting. Endermen would only drop them in the overworld, so you couldn't farm them in the end. The human head would be dropped when a player gets killed by another player. If in single player, the human head has a .3% chance of getting dropped so farming would be a little harder since you could suicide farm. If in hardcore mode, then you just don't get to have a human head.

**What if I don't want my server's players getting powers for certain items?** A simple command for disabled head powers should suffice. Also

**Heads were meants to be decorative! You're taking unecessary concepts too far.** Well hey

I really think movement in Minecraft could use some improvement. It's not the first thing that comes to mind, and has been the same for a very long time. The only improvement made to movement has been sprinting, and I would personally love to see a lot more added to the game, by doing a few simple additions. I honestly think it would significantly improve the fun of playing the game, both in adventure maps with more creative parkour, and survival with simple quality of life improvements.

**Here is how it works:**

Mob parties would have a very small chance of spawning at night or in a dark place, 5 to 7 of the same mob will spawn nearby and follow it. Any mob of the same type that comes near a leader will follow it and 'join' the party. The only times that the mobs will stop following the leader are the death of the leader or the finding of a target (player, golem, villager, etc.) I think this mechanic would make combat exiting and be interesting for mapmakers to experiment with.

So then there's the idea of scrying

**Throwing an eye of ender causes it to be thrown like an enderpearl, is switched to the where the eye lands**. The player can then view an area more discretely without having to worry about running to that area and risking their life if it's dangerous. The camera can only turn, but not move, so it becomes a sort of fly on the wall. During this time however, the player is standing idle and is potentially vulnerable from where they threw it, so they should try to find a far off area that is safe, be protected by another player

**Hitting the eye, or killing the idle player severs the connection and destroys the eye.** Destroying the eye causes damage to the player using it equal to the amount done to the eye, so it's possible to even be killed if you don't sever the connection fast enough when spotted.

I'm thinking the risk of using the eye would be about the same as the potential pros
