My other aim is to give you some words to maybe put on your facebook page (I will also share your band with people I know in the industry). Writing a bio is all very well

I will post the resulting review on my blog and share it on my facebook and twitter feeds.

His Bandcamp site is located [here] (http://mattmarsan.bandcamp.com)

If you like what you hear

This is his story from my perspective. My little brother left home about three years ago. He decided he did not want to go to college and left home with nothing but his guitar and his thumb. He hitch hiked across the United States, then Arizona, then up to Seattle. Along the way he met many people and had some truly incredible experiences. He played in Austin Texas, worked at a self-sustaining Ashram in Arizona, stayed on an Indian Reservation with the blessing of the chief of the tribe, and attended the Rainbow Gathering. He has so many amazing stories and they have influenced him greatly in the way he writes his music.

Today, so this is my attempt to share some of the wonderful music he has created with some of you.

I appreciate anyone that takes the time out of their day to give some of his music a listen. He truly just loves creating beautiful songs and he finds his joy in this. His happiness inspires me to be a better man every day and appreciate the things I have around me

~Sincerely

[A proud brother] (http://imgur.com/X7JI9CC)

i am considering offering critisicm/praise for a short initial period... you will have to request a listen directly... you have to want to have it... really

what are my qualifications for this? I consider myself a music lover in most if not all forms... I am a retired slice the pie reviewer with over 3

I am in a band myself and know that getting an 'honest' opinion or indeed any opinion at all can be hard

also to be honest i miss listening to loads of new unknown music

I like what I like... I could always be/ am likely to be wrong - hell I wouldnt have signed Biffy Clyro.... (or Adele) I may not get past the first ten seconds... reviews may be brief and to the point...

your best track... any takers? I must be mad....

edit one track per artist... i did say your best track..

&gt; The Tension are a young rock band (ages 16-18) from New York City, bassist Gabe Simon and drummer Damien Moffitt. They met each other over the summer of 2010, and just took off and began to write, and soon recorded a powerful 3 song demo produced by Tomato (Sound Of Urchin, etc.) and Doug Gillard (Guided By Voices, etc.). After taking a year to write more, rehearse and play shows, produced by Tomato and mixed by Ruddy Cullers. The album was recorded at NYC's Stratosphere Sound (James Iha from Smashing Pumpkins and Adam Schlesinger from Fountains Of Wayne's studio), and groove. Sometimes described as ""Radiohead meets Jam""

[Here's their Tumblr] (http://thetensionband.tumblr.com/). They also have a [Facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/TheTension1).

Ever since I graduated high school, and started writing instrumental songs. Just piano and bass with some strings. I did that for a couple of years. Then, I started recording guitar tracks. In 2008, I swallowed my fears and started to sing. Three albums later, well, here we are.

I don't really have much gear - just a single electric guitar, some pedals, and my computer. I do all my own recording, mixing, and production. Last night, I ordered my first (small) round of discs, and signed off on the digital distribution agreement for iTunes and whatnot. I'm still learning

I'm a recording artist (among others) and I've been making music for a couple of years now. And I've recently finished my fourth album: Glitch-22.
It's experimental lounge music with a trip hop touch. A deep sound is created through several layers of samples and reverbs. 
The lounge aspect is what stands out most and apart from the last song
The last song is more dancy and has got kind of a summer vibe to it
It certainly is not unenergetic. Some songs are even very uplifting and make you bounce your head. Catchy sounds

You can grab my latest album

Most recently, because she was a friend of a friend, and I knew she couldn't really afford to pay me due to her financial situation.  

Fast forward about a year and a half. She shows up one day and says I need a single for my new album. She told me she was looking for sponsorship to be able to pay for production/recording costs. I told her I will also do my best to place the song in movies/tv shows/commercials etc. so that we can make some residual income aside from album sales. After her taking 3 months to record a single song, talking about how we are ""idiots"" and we ""Fucked up HER song"" even though I haven't signed any sort of release form, NOR have I been paid yet. All this because another engineer claimed to hear digital pops in the recording that we did. We went back and listened to the raw files and there isn't a single pop. As angry as I was, I was still willing to let it go and finish the song just to be done with it, however she decided to keep talking shit behind my back. Now I've had enough. I copyrighted the instrumental that I created along with the melody I wrote for the hook (which is the driving force behind the entire song) then told her these are my terms. $1,000 + we split the publishing 50/50. And I'm even STILL WILLING to try and get the song placed in movies/tv shows/commercials etc. She claims that SHE is the one who wrote the melody for the hook when all she did is write the lyrics to MY melody and that what I'm doing is extremely unfair and immoral and that my price is ""preposterous"".

I think I'm being pretty fair considering how much free work I've done for her in the past

Am I wrong?

TL;DR
Recording artist wastes 3 months of my time without paying me, then says my price is unfair even though after all that, I'm still willing to help her make extra income from media placements. $1,000 + 50/50 publishing is my price.",,False,,False,t3_1hg5q5
