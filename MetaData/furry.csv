So I count myself as a casual furry. I've been so since the late 90s. I like the artwork, meets, and have a number of furry friends in real life. I consider myself a pretty straight edge guy, I don’t dress strangely or go around wearing ears or tail in public. That stuff stays in Cons, festivals, etc. Not meeting up at Denny’s for a movie. I don’t openly advertise my interest in it, but I don’t particularly hide it either. Frankly

They all seem to have a twisted “special snowflake” syndrome. They all think the world should have to put up with their stupid fake fluffy personalities, while making stupid animal noises throughout the night. And everyone lets it go. I try to be pleasant and a nice guy, but god forbid If I say something;I’m the asshole and should be shunned while others coddle the fool. I can’t stand the constant emphasis on a false sense of “brotherhood”, not to mention furry ‘status’.

“Oh

As if this is supposed to elevate you in my eyes? You are simply using supposed ‘friends’ for your own personal gain and satisfaction. You are still a basement dwelling neckbeard, and have no ambition in real life. This is the second big thing I hate about most furries I meet. They have no direction in real life. Half of them are content to sit at home and live vicariously on the internet, and the rest seem happy to waste their time at school with no solid idea of what they should be doing, pursuing useless degrees then sitting around working at fast food with a 4 year degree. To be clear, I’m not hating on people aren’t college educated, hell, I am not myself! I just went back to college after years in the workforce. It’s just so few and far between are the ones who have actual jobs and a real living. I’m not mad if you don’t have a job or money, a college town

Also, and stop communicating via text/messaging like your cat walked across the keyboard, it’s not fucking cute. Stop with the stupid *emotes* and kitty faces after I’ve asked you to for the millionth time.

But after all of this bitching, and with friends. I still want to participate and hang out with people to talk about the latest works, or act stupid in costumes. But I also want some goddamn friends who know when shit is appropriate, and when it isn’t. Some friends that I can talk to about dog-headed people humping, but be comfortable having a beer with at the local bar and grill.

**TL;DR:** Getting tired of dealing with social awkward penguins and foul bachelor frogs. Want some goddamn normal people to hang out with

Hi guys

So for all you peeps who have a fursona but have never had a picture drawn of them before (or perhaps you do have a picture but you had to draw it yourself, and if you know someone who has never had art done before and would like to surprise them with a picture, feel free to describe their character for me and we'll see how far I get.  :)

I can't promise I'll get to everyone, so maybe you'll get a sketch, maybe you get a full color, just depends on my mood.  If you'd like to see my art, check out my FA here: http://www.furaffinity.net/user/rikkoshaye/ or my DA here: http://rikkoshaye.deviantart.com/

Finally, if you don't mind of course.  :)  Otherwise I think that's it!  Thanks everyone!  I hope I get lots of responses.  :D",,False,self,t5_2qi2h,1358554294.0,,

So two days ago I bring home my friends fursuit because he's letting me borrow it for Halloween.  It's been sitting up in a high spot in his room collecting some color the the smoking he does

Eyes are pretty derp on the fursuit

Fast forward 20 minutes.  My mom is on Google looking up fursuits, offering to make one for me if I ever want one of my own (which I totally do) and talking about how when she was a kid she loved to pretend to be a horse.

Are my parents just crazy

You are not as hated as some of you may think. Out of all my friends who are internet savvy enough to know what a furry is (i'd say about 10 people)

You shouldn't listen to haters or get mad just because of some trolls who are just fishing for a reaction on the internet. In fact you shouldn't listen at all to people who may hate what you like. Do what you like if it makes you feel good and it doesn't hurt anyone.

Then why do you see so much hate on the internet? Ask yourselves this the next time

I will however not respect people who say ""I am a furry and if you got  a problem with it then fuck you too"" but that goes for anyone

I felt like telling you how it really is since most people wouldn't waste any time telling other that they don't really care much. And you know that something is wrong if you got a whole fandom thinking everyone hates them.

You stay cool

P.S Not trying to whore myself out but feel free to post this on your DA journal

Did you think first that i was going to post hate in this thread? See. We need to change that.

1367375371.0,1dgfx8,How to best describe your character to someone else.,StubbornClaws,83,9,28,"As an artist I am occasionally asked to make character reference sheets from scratch. It has become increasingly obvious that some people are good at describing their character for me to draw

Communication is key when designing a fresh character sheet. The following things can happen if things are not communicated properly:

- The client is left with something they don't want due to an artist not wanting to take the time to correct things.

- The artist is forever correcting things because the client is never sure exactly what they want.

- The commission is cancelled completely due to the frustration of either party.


Whether the lack in communication is derived from the artist or the client, artist or client but I hope this will help. The advice is mainly aimed at clients who need the describe their character because that's where the communication begins. I'll follow up with a little note on how best to find your artist and what to avoid.


- Firstly put all your character's information in dot points. This way it is far easier to read

- Be specific about your character's species. If it is a hybrid be clear about which animal is prominent in which areas (tail

- Mention you character's physique. Are they muscly, somewhere in between? Is any part of their body exaggerated or smaller than usual? Also [feet](http://www.freepaws.org/digiplant.gif).

- Fur/scale/skin/feather colour. Start with the basics and if you can, don't just say ""dark brown"". 

- Markings. These are not just the little stripes and things. For example if your character has a lighter colour on its belly and cheeks

- Another thing about markings is that it's much clearer if you list each one individually. Each dot point should be a new part of the body or a different coloured marking. Think about if you were drawing it

- Have a specific pattern or marking in mind that isn't a basic shape? For the love of god PLEASE have an example or rough sketch. Descriptions of swirly swirls that go over there and around that arm but only just over the shoulder blade but not near the neck with spots that are only on the rights side that follow... ow

- Things that are often forgotten. I understand when you're describing something it's hard to think of everything because it's in your head and not on a page. Things I find are often forgotten are: eyes, paw pads, hooves, horns, claws and even the inside of the mouth can be helpful. Plus genitalia for the NSFW refs. You'd be surprised how many times I've needed to know what colour certain... uh... body parts needed to be. If you can see it, it needs a colour.

- For accessories and clothes it's also good to have examples. Google images is honestly good for everything. If you can describe it to an artist then you can just as easily type it into google

- If all else fails. If you think your character is just far too difficult to describe grab a blank template ([female](http://www.furaffinity.net/view/8628639/) [male](http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6706583/), jump on Paint or whatever you have available and fill it in yourself. Draw in rough tails or wings and whatever else you need and give that to the artist. Visual references beat words on a page any day. Do whatever you can to make things clear and easy to understand. 

- THEN, colours and whatever else marked out BEFORE they finish it. Make sure you ask for this from the beginning so that you're able to change anything you don't like before the work is done. Most artists should offer this anyway and they should also give you multiple updates on the progress of your character, but we all know some artists are grumpy bums in it for the money and won't make the effort unless you bug them. So bug them! There's nothing worse than putting in all that effort to describe something and at the end of the day, walking away with something you hate. 

- Always remember the character is yours and you should get exactly what you want. Don't let the artist make artistic changes based on their own opinion unless it's already been agreed upon. Don't get pushed around. They're happy to work for you (most of the time) and do exactly what you say

- Finally if an artist doesn't have a terms of service or isn't willing to lay out the exact process of designing a character and staying in contact with you... avoid them. New character sheets can often be a difficult thing and no matter how well you're prepared the artist may not be. Look for experience. Someone who's already made plenty of sheets for themselves and preferably others as well. Finding other happy customers is always a good sign.


In summary: Dot points, colours, markings, revise (make sure you haven't forgotten anything), clothes and accessories, visual examples, you're in charge

I hope this helped and wasn't a whole blah of ramblings. If anyone else has some suggestions based on their own experience please feel free to comment with them. Plus I've tried my very best not to be artist biased here... if I have been,False,self,t5_2qi2h,False,,,t3_1dgfx8

I'm sure a lot of people have had a similar experience when it comes to the furry fandom, when it comes to furries I'd consider myself bi, leaning towards male. 

I've long considered sexuality to be more of a spectrum than a black or white dichotomy, so I've postured to myself that maybe for me and a lot of others, the furry fandom is a more free expression in many aspects of someone's life, possibly including sexuality.

So when I think about the kind of things that are sexually arousing to me when it comes to furries, etc, and I wonder how much of this is because of the way in which the furry fandom might feel ""safer"", or if this is simply a repressed sexuality or persona that one does not get to exhibit in normal circumstances. 

It may be that because the community and the subculture can be very open and frank about sexuality that these things seem more commonplace; i.e. MOST people might have a sexual spectrum but one is more capable of expressing it as a furry. There may be an aspect of this that has to do with male furries not seeming as ""male"" as a human
