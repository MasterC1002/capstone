The plans quickly changed from going out to dinner and a movie, I had to steam vacuum the carpet (spills and dog accidents that had been quickly soaked up.) I threw the dirty dishes from the counter into a sink of soapy water to disguise them

I had never felt this level of anxiety about my house or realized how unacceptable my house was until an old friend (who I didn't necessarily need to impress but didn't want to disgust) was about to see it. How have I let it get this bad? I don't want to have to keep people from coming into my house anymore. I don't want to have to warn them about the mess before coming in. I don't want to feel embarrassed anymore when someone has to use my bathroom. If it isn't acceptable for someone else

So I got up this morning and began to carry out my plan. I took before pictures of the living room and kitchen. I plan to use these so I can ""see"" the mess and clutter that I normally don't realize is there. Then

The two roadblocks I have met recently are not having my husband's help and not having the money to purchase the shelving I need to properly contain the items in my bedroom. I hope to get my husband to at least keep ""his areas"" clear of garbage

Exhausting. If I set something down it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple days to find it again. All the storage we have is full of plastic junk, vases, candy jars, plates, and all kinds of crap we aren't supposed to ever get rid of.

The other day I went to the dentist and he said I should stop drinking pop and switch to those sugar-free drink packets. Okay. I really shouldn't be drinking pop.

3) **Happiness.** I come from a semi-hoardish family (poor, but now I realize that things are actually making me UNhappy. Things are temporary, and so if they are destroyed, that would render me unhappy if I stored my happiness in possessions and money. I am tired of feeling like my possessions own me.

4) **Thinking about my next move.** I moved from a 650 sq. ft. apartment to an 1100 sq. ft. house plus a large basement. I have filled the space to the brim

5) **My relationship with my SO.** While clutter has never caused problems in my relationship, my SO can barely find the things that are directly in front of him. I feel like the clutter is a little more my fault than his, so I feel like his frustrations in finding objects are partly my fault, and I don't want that to turn into resentment towards me. Clutter also stresses me out, and he is usually the one I vent to when I am stressed out - no need to place an unnecessary burden on him.

I spent my first week getting oriented around the plant and the server room

So I came up with this idea:  I set an alarm on my phone for 4:30pm every Friday.  They had a staff B-B-Q and drinks at that time each week so everybody wound down.  Also I could get away with wearing jeans so the decent pants didn't get ruined by the graveyard dust.

Every Friday at 4:30 I'd take a beer into the graveyard and start sorting through stuff.  Every time something went into the bin/recycling.

Every Friday at 4:30.  Beer/Bin/recycling.

By the time I moved on there was a semblance of organisation amongst the chaos.

I've been thinking the last few days about the recent post by     
/u/marpstar entitled [The Evil of Storage Containers](http://redd.it/1igotp).*

/u/marpstar's argument was:
 &gt; ...storage containers are the absolute worse thing you can buy if you're trying to organize your home. In the process of decluttering my house

----

**The Usefulness of Storage Containers** or    
 
 **The Evil of Purchasing Things for the Sake of Decluttering**

A storage container is a useful tool in decluttering when it is given     
a single purpose. A principle of decluttering is that every item has     
its own permanent place and a only one place for every item.

**The storage container does not behave badly the declutter does:**

When you are starting to declutter
techniques to help you organize
techniques it is easy to throw unlike items in one container and   
it is out of sight
drawer"". Each container in your house should have only one purpose.   
Label it clearly
what that purpose is. Then stick to it. 

**A simple solution for merging and assessing:**    

During the process of decluttering before you know what you  
want to keep and what you don't a storage container can become  
a ""unique
get an idea of how big the real permanent place needs to be for that  
item. Then you can start looking out for cleared spaces in your house   
that will accomodate it. I've often filled a storage box and realized
hey this would fit in that cabinet I just cleared out. It is then as   
simple as walking to the next room with the box and unpacking  
it in its new home. If you do realize that these items need a specific   
home
exactly the dimensions of the space.


**A storage container is like a trial separation:**    

Once like items are merged in their storage box
on it (add a re-open by date to it)
(emotional) distance from the items in there. I've done this before for   
a collection of books and when I went back to it
the of 20. The space I had gained from putting that collection to the    
side


 
**The best storage container is free:**     

Buying things to declutter is counterproductive. Buying a storage     
container is not a good way to start decluttering.The truth is after       
the stuff is gone
container. An item without a use is clutter.

Any box, any basket can be a  storage     
container. I do personally buy moving boxes for less than a       
dollar a box to help us declutter. Then I use them to bring the     
decluttered items to the donation place. The sunk cost is worth       
the ability to get rid of it easily.

The only purchase you should consider is not for decluttering
a permanent home  for the things you know you want to keep. That     
should be done at the end of decluttering not at the beginning and     
probably not in the middle. Resist that urge and you will probably   
find that you have enough space already.

I read that post and the comments below and decided I wanted to get rid of 50 things

I did not count actual garbage (napkins, recycled, or permanently relocated out of my bedroom and into another, more appropriate location in the house.

Gone are:

* 4 coke bottle caps (I hoard them until I enter the codes!)
* a ziploc bag
* a plastic knife (Panera gave me like 6 of every utensil when I went last time...for 2 bowls of soup)
* 2 sugar packets
* a plant food packet that I never used
* 2 envelopes
* nail polish remover
* 3 expired or I won't use this coupons
* 2 comment cards to be mailed off
* set of healing stones that I got in a redditgifts exchange which I will be passing on to a friend
* 2 water bottles that have been sitting in an unused purse for months
* a no longer played with cat toy
* 9 receipts
* 2 cardboard earring holders
* sack of toasted soy beans that I'm not sure of the age on
* box of expired keurig coffees that were a gift that never got sent (I'm terrible at mailing :( )
* 5 condiment packets 
* 2 empty food packages
* 2 packs of health food I got in a monthly subscription box that I am not interested in
* empty sanitizer bottle
* flyer that came with this months Better Homes &amp; Gardens with coupons I am not interested in
* 2 kleenex boxes
* used wrapping paper
* 2 more gifts from the aforementioned never shipped box

If you were to graph the momentum of my decluttering efforts, then slowly climb upward as things begin to fall into place and I realize that I'm creating order and making my life better. When I'm feeling great about a job that's almost completed, the momentum is high again.

1366872732.0,1d2i82,Decluttering Technique: Limited Space,parle,38,4,2,"**Things Tend to Disperse**

A common example is pens. They are in every room in your house - in drawers, in purses. The idea behind it is you can never have enough so that you can always find one when you need it. Actually, it's often the case that it's not in the first place you look and you go around looking for a pen. This confirms the idea that you can never have enough pens.

**Every Thing Has a Place and Every Thing in Its Place**

You only need the one pen when you want to write something down

**Assigning Places**

There's another benefit to having just one place for each item

**Using Limited Space to Make a Collection**

For example

[Pictures here](http://imgur.com/HeGn5b1)

 * **Pick a Space:** Clear off an area for your collection. To choose the area: Think about how often you need to access the items. Does it bring you joy to see the objects? Then think about showcasing them on a shelf. In my case
 * **Gather:** The rroblem was,  the window sill, and in drawers. So, I gathered them all. 19 vases. 
 * **Evaluate:** Seeing them together helped me compare what I had. If they were pens, but if I change my mind and want them back  I could just buy another soda and keep that bottle. So my criteria for judging was *color*, *style*, and *availability*.
 * **Arrange:** Now put the items in their space. This Limited Space is the only space in your house for these items when they aren't in use. If a vase doesn't fit in the Limited Space you chose
 * **Maintain:** That's it. You now have a collection. You can add things to your collection, dust the objects...the dust will help you see which ones you never use. Sell those or give them as a gift to someone. 

The benefit is, an old 70s vase will probably go for 50 cents at a flea market but the Jugendstil vase I can sell for 10 Euros. Then I can continue  to use it or I can sell it for a good price when the opportunity presents itself.  Or, back to the first example, if I have pens that work and I can find it every time I need it, I save money or time not having to go out an get more pens.

Keep in mind

Please make sure to not run out and buy organizers before you know exactly what you will be organizing! Focus on sorting through your paper clutter. You want your organizers to suit your needs

***

**Casual**: Declutter all paper that is not already inside something (like a binder, etc.). You can do this all at once by collecting up all these bits of paper, or pile-by-pile as you go. 

Extra: Stack all unsorted folders and bins of paper together.

**Normal**: Declutter all the paper from a single area (bin, you can do it all at once if you prefer, or section by section.

Extra: Clean off a space like a desk or a dining room table and use that as your organizing station. Just make sure all the papers have a home by the end of the week!

**Hard**: Find a large workspace, filing box). Grab a bin or laundry basket and hunt down all the paper you can find. You might have to do this a few, or even several, times. Turn it into a game with your kids, roommate, SO, or self.

On your large workspace, or toss things as you go. When you're done, you should have more manageable piles to tackle individually.

Extra: If you don't have a large workspace

***


**Paperwork you must keep**:[1](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/5-steps-to-simpler-record-keeping-10000000688976/index.html)  [2](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/how-long-to-keep-financial-records.aspx)

These should be filed first

**Mail**: It's a good idea to shred anything with your name and address on it, as well. For bills, designate a place where they will be paid and sit them there. 

**Work/School Papers**: Work for current projects/clients/classes should be organized in or near your workspace for easy reference. For completed work/school projects (particularly with school) reevaluate keeping every paper. Most of that information is available online. For work

**Kids**: This can include [artwork](http://www.nourishingjoy.com/conquering-clutter-what-to-do-with-kids-artwork/)

Create an action file where all the papers from their backpack get sorted after school. An example could be: completed assignments

1371539552.0,1gklpx,Decluttering Technique: Exit Plan,parle,33,5,8,"Before you start your next delcuttering task

**There are four basic ways to get rid of stuff:**

 * **Sell/Give as a present:** This means the value of the item is apparent. If I can sell it
  * If I can find examples of the used item selling for 1/3 of the original value and that amount is more than 10€ then it is worth the time to sell it. Unless I am planning to set up a flea market table then I will sell anything that is worth more than 1€. What I don't sell gets donated directly after the flea market.
  * Examples: Working electronics, decorative items. Everything should be clean and working. 
 * **Donate:** Although the item is still useful
  * Examples: Clothing, furniture, books, arts and crafts supplies, sporting equipment. [More here](http://redd.it/19a078)
 * **Recycle** Before I put anything in the trash
  * Examples: Old electronics, wood, plastic, metal, old paint/toxic chemicals, glass, compost etc. 
 * **Trash** This is really the last resort. But it is often the first items I pick out to declutter. Trash for me mean no value. A broken hair tie or a dirty tissue. There's actually very little that needs to go in the trash can.

**Build an Exit Plan**

Before you start

 * How much does an item have to be worth to consider selling it. While you are decluttering you will be guessing at the worth of the item. 
 * What charities would be interested in these items? While you are decluttering all donate items can be grouped together or you can already fill a bag for clothing/toiletries donation to a shelter and book donation to a library.  
 * Make a pile of broken manufactured goods. Most materials can be recycled.
 * Have a garbage bag handy.     



**Lastly put your Exit Plan into action**
 
 1. Start with Sell: Look up the current market value and used value for the item. Anything not worth it can go into your donate boxes. 
 2. Look up opening times for drop off or schedule a pick up from the charity.
 3. Clearly label all recycables and bring them to recycling center/call for pick up/have them ready to be put out on recycling day.
 4. Garbage.

Why is that? 

The point of this not to advocate living in empty rooms. Rather


My approach to decluttering has changed a lot.

* When I first started decluttering I got rid of things that I no longer planned to use. 
* Later I opened up storage areas and got rid of things I no longer needed and that I knew were replaceable. 
* I almost completely stopped buying things and try to stick to the one in-one out system when I do.
* Then I started comparing items and only keeping a choice few.

I've tried that now on our multi-purpose room a few times but clutter keeps coming back. The space is cramped

Recently

So, so anytime I use it I just use the middle. Also the piles form because I can't put away things that are in the far side of the room until the middle is clear.

I have a plan now and I'll be working on it this weekend.

All it took was remembering what it looked like when it was empty.

**What point are you at now? Can you say you're clutter-free?**


Clutter comes off in layers. First I got rid of the really obvious things I didn't need.   Once, and I began to notice another layer of excess.  Next, I got rid of that. Rinse repeat. As such, I’d say excepting extreme cases, one is almost never truly clutter free. 

I am at a point where its harder to find things to get rid of--the layers aren’t as obvious.  I don’t have much I don’t use.  There are still things there though that I don’t need and lately I’ve been focusing on the less obvious clutter in my life like my online presence, etc. There are still layers for me to get rid of. 


**What was the turning point that led to you starting to declutter? What inspired you? What makes you want to keep your space clean and clutter-free?**


Consuming less in every way from cutting empty calories from my diet to owning fewer pairs of shoes that will eventually end up in the landfill to reducing my media consumption allows me to having more money to help others, The more stuff I got rid of, the better I felt spiritually, financially, environmentally, physically (because I was using more muscle over motors), etc. Less really is more. 


**What was easier to do than you thought? What was harder? What is your biggest frustration or pet peeve when it comes to decluttering?**


It was easier that I thought. Slimming down what I own and thinking more about what I need has been pretty enlightening for me. The hardest thing for me has been not buying new stuff. Also, but much of it is essential for my hobbies: rock climbing gear, biking gear, sewing machine and fabrics, etc.)  



**Can you tell us about what systems or techniques that you found most useful?**

1.	Do it layer by layer. No need to do it all at once. First get rid of the really obvious things you don't need. Then get used to that

2.	Walk or bike to the grocery store. This has cleared out my pantry/refrigerator tremendously and slashed my grocery bill by probably 50% or more. I buy way less because I have to really prioritize and it has helped me cut out a lot of empty calories (like sodas for example) because they're heavy to carry and I'd rather use that space in my backpack for something a little more important nutrition-wise like meats or vegetables. The food clutter in my pantry has almost vanished. This is not feasible for everyone

3.	Try to actually eat up all or most of the food you already have before going grocery shopping again. If I’m feeling sorry for myself for having to eat something that I don’t want to eat, and move on with my life making sure not to buy that in the future.

4.	Make more deliberate buying choices. Its not about self control or austerity or anything like that, but agreeing with a philosophy is much easier than changing a lifetime of habits. It was easy to get rid of old things that I didn't use, but much harder to not buy new things. Especially things that I knew I really would use but didn't necessarily need. In the beginning, I was actually spending more money because my house was like a revolving door where I was getting rid of a lot of stuff, but also bringing a lot of stuff in--even more so than before. I think placing that emphasis in my mind about not buying almost made me want to buy more. It's like when someone says don't think about elephants--the first thing you think about is elephants. Really jonesing for something, but not allowing yourself to buy it is unpleasant and very hard to stick to. The trick is to gradually stop wanting (admittedly easier said than done). I was able to get rid of this constant desire for stuff by making more deliberate buying choices. If there's something that I really want (not on a whim, but for a substantial period of time) even though I know I don't need it, but I found that that's not usually the case. Doing the research to find a well-designed good-quality product keeps me from buying a lot of stuff (even when its hurts because its a big upfront investment). Before, I would not allow myself to buy it and maybe try to find a cheaper alternative. This cheaper alternative would never really quench that desire though. I was still jonesing for the thing I had wanted initially and would buy another cheaper alternative thinking that maybe that one would satisfy the want. Rinse repeat. (I would do this with clothes for example). Eventually

5.	Ask “Do I need this?” not “Do I / Would I use this?”  Just because you would or do use it, since my apartment has all concrete floors, I realized that I don’t need a vacuum it since a good old fashioned broom and dustpan do the job just fine. Just because I use it and it makes my life more convenient doesn’t mean it’s worth having around. Re-evaluate: do you really need it or does it just make your life more convenient.

6.	If you feel like you’re trapped in a cycle where you’re bringing in too much, you will have to check at the thrift store or on ebay first. This is good for your wallet and the environment. Not everything you buy needs to be new anyways.

7.	Reducing the amount of mail you get by:
a.	Changing the setting for your bank statements
b.	use Catalog Choice to request to be removed from mailing lists like L.L.Bean or ASPCA or whoever else sends you mail that you don’t read. The environment will thank you for this as well. 

8.	Reduce papers and notebooks that you don’t know what to do with by using Evernote. I thought scanning all that stuff in would be a huge pain in the ass, or more often I just use the ""scan"" feature in Evernote itself, which simply processes the image to maximize contrast and reduce noise. Keeping track of stacks of papers is a pain in the ass! Plus I have all my notes with me everywhere I go on my phone (also on my laptop/ iPad obviously). Additionally, my back isn't sore at the end of the day anymore from toting around books and notebooks and folders.

9.	Minimizing your online presence.
 .	Instead of deleting junk mail
a.	Consolidate accounts-- make sure you’re the same email address for everything
b.	Delete unused accounts. Still have a MySpace account? Delete it! Have a Twitter account
c.	Delete FaceBook “friends” you don’t care to keep in touch with. 

10.	Consolidate &amp; minimize your digital possessions by:
 .	Sync your contacts between devices. How I did it: Instead of having certain contacts on my phone, etc., I’ve switched them all to be in Google contacts. If you use Apple products like me, you can then sync that with Mail.app on your computer and Contacts on your iPhone using CardDAV (see here for more info). 
a.	Keep your calendar digital and sync it between devices. How I did it: Much like with my contacts above, it’s still very secure.
b.	Erase songs you don’t like from your iTunes library. If you still keep CDs around
c.	Delete photos you wouldn’t care if you lost. Deleting photos was hard for me at first. A while back though, etc. Most everything else I didn’t care about. My computer ended up being okay and I didn’t lose the files, but it made me think that if I didn’t care if I lost all those photos, why did I need to even keep copies of them on my computer? I deleted photos I didn’t care about and the ones I did care about I now keep in Dropbox (if you don’t have a Dropbox account, you should get one , so I won’t lose the important ones if something does happen to my computer. 
d.	Get rid of old document files you no longer need. If its an important paper I spent a long time on and think I might go back and read later or use for something else, no matter how much time I may have spent on it, I am never going to look at most old papers again. 
e.	Use Google Drive to make new documents. I don’t even have Microsoft Office on my computer. Google Drive is better for almost all the things I need to do in almost every way: its free, it saves as you go so you don’t have to worry about Microsoft Word crashing and all your work being lost, you can access it from anywhere, if something happens to your computer, you won’t lose anything. 


**Is there anything about your space that makes it more challenging to be clutter-free (i.e. lack of cupboards/storage? Too much storage?)?**


I think it really helps that I have a pretty small apartment. Also

1361610615.0,192nmg,STORE IT Saturday: Daily Decluttering Theme,parle,29,2,12,"Hi! Today is Saturday

Today is the day to look at storage related clutter.

**Storage Questions to ask followed by suggested decluttering task:**
 
**Storage Areas and Usage:** What areas do I use for storage? What things are in them? Don't forget storage is any place something is just sitting in and not being used for its intended purpose. So include 

 * [food storage](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/10qvwm/clutter_challenge_3_food_clutter/)
 * [cleaning supplies storage](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/under-sink-storage-00100000077884/page4.html) [+](http://www.kfh.org/services/freeservices/download_files/guidelines_for_storage_of_cleaning_supplies_poisons.pdf) [+](http://www.bhg.com/homekeeping/house-cleaning/tips/cleaning-supplies-storage/)
 * [bed linens](http://unclutterer.com/2011/02/17/storing-bed-sheets/)
 * [pots and pans](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/192nmg/store_it_saturday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8k90ec)
 * [digital storage](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/192nmg/store_it_saturday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8kewzr)
 * [email inboxes](http://inboxzero.com/) 
 * [paper](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/19si42/where_does_your_clutter_come_from/c8r7roy)

 * Task (10-20 mins): Make a list of storage areas and what type of things are where. Is there a rhyme and reason to your organization? Use a simple rating system if the storage is accessible and you know what is there
  * [Attic Storage Organizing Checklist](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/more-rooms/attic-organizing-checklist-00000000002161/index.html)

**Sesonal Items:** Do you only need something once a year or every few months? 

  * Task (15+ minutes): Put it away. I'm talking to you, seasonal decoration

**Museum Vault:** Can't part with it

  * Task (20 minutes): Then reduce your decorations and switch them out everyonce in awhile. Just like Museums do, pictures, junk. Clear it off completely. Put a few things back on that look nice. Put the rest in storage in a few days/weeks/months open the box and switch the items out. Don't forget to label.

**Clear Storage Space:** Why am I keeping this? We've all packed boxes in a hurry to get it out of the way. Face your demons.
 
 * Task (15-30 minutes): Take 1 unlabeled box or object out of storage. Declutter the one box. Sort into Keep, Garbage, piles. (This can give you a task for Sell it Sunday or Take it out Tuesday.) 

**What about you?**

 * Any storage decluttering related tasks that you have planned? 
 * Ask questions about storage problems
 * Add ideas for task suggestions.
 * Please post any storage related sucesses in the comments. Show us a before and after picture. (You don't have to have done it on a Saturday.)
 * Links to articles about storage or other posts.

I've always considered moving to a new place as a great time to really go through my belongings and organize as I pack.

There is a point in the story when all he owns is the clothing on his back and a begging bowl.

I've seen the tip of using a shoe organiser to keep cleaning stuff in so I forked out 15 quid to get a clear one so the bathroom airing cupboard can be [less of a frigging nightmare](http://imgur.com/a/CEZ3C). When I mentioned that I was going to get one because I thought it was a really good idea my mum (half) jokingly asked me when I was planning on moving out. Ha ha ha. 

She's been reorganising the kitchen. Reorganising is just cleaning stuff and putting it back somewhere else and very little ever gets thrown away. One day when she went to work she left a note asking me to empty and clean the cupboards in the kitchen, mug and glass we had](http://imgur.com/DlP1vVb). This isn't every single item, there are a few glass sets I didn't bring in and some mugs on the dresser.

In an attempt to make this seem like less of an assault I put a whole load of mugs that I didn't have to think twice about getting rid of at one end

I had my suspicions that nothing would change and it hasn't. All the mugs have gone back to their original hiding place. Every one. I can't deal with this any more. I'm trying to help but this wall of resistance is making me lose my patience. It's making me want to take every god damn thing in this fucking house and burn it. I never throw anything away without her seeing it first. It's only fair

How the fuck do I do this? I'm trying to do it as gently as possible but nothing is getting through. Do I lay down the law and be a total bitch about all the pointless shit we're holding on to? Every time I mention something all I get is another fucking excuse. I walked around the house and screamed when I saw all the shit that's just been put back.

I removed everything that shouldn't belong in the kitchen and stated that that shit is not to go back in there. I've done this several times and each time it's gone back in. So now we've got kitchen shit everywhere

It's going to get worse for the next 3 weeks since she has an assignment due. I agree she should prioritise this

* Now: A = C but a lot of people still thought A = B

3. ""Why does this help with vareity?"" Well it's the only thing I have in this shade of blue...hmm already I was doubting its usefulness.

We went over to my brother's house over the weekend and his wife has come up with a decluttering system for their 7 year old...

For 7 days (almost) nothing new comes into your home. Here's how:

 1. Start by making a list at home of things you need to spend money on or want to buy. Split the items on your list into 3 categories. 
  * **Food Shopping List**: Make a [meal plan for 1 week](http://www.wikihow.com/Meal-Plan). Look through your cupboards
  * **Bill Paying List**: Which bills do you need to pay this week. Make a list. 
  * **Everything Else List**: Put things on a list to research. Go online and look up prices. Decide on color, whatever you can chooose. Decide when it comes into your home, where are you going to put it? Will it replace an item you already have? How will you get rid of the item that is going to be replaced? Write this all on the list.  (You can keep adding to this list for the whole week.) 

 2. Limit your shopping trip to only one time during the week. Don't forget your **Food Shopping List**. Only pick up things on your list. If you forgot something

 3. Pay your bills

 4. After 7 days review your **Everything Else List**. Anything, can be bought if you still feel you need it.

what you need and what you don't
why you need it or why you don't

* Decide what you really need.
* Enjoy and take care of what you have.
* Make more educated purchases.
* Develop organizational skills.
* Feel more secure knowing you have the basics covered.
* Trust your ability to make good decisions.
* Have more free time to do enjoyable things or just relax.

**Directional organizing: Use gravity as your guide.**

 * The top shelf is for items that will be eaten raw (cheese or cold cuts)
 * the next shelf is for things that will be slightly warmed or rewarmed (leftovers)
 * the next shelf is for things that need to be cooked (raw meat). 

This prevents raw meat from dripping onto food that won't be cooked. Most refrigerator allow you to adjust the shelves to different heights.

You all voted for Food Clutter to be the topic for the next two weeks.

This includes your fridge, and/or emergency stores.

**Casual**: Pick one

**Normal**: Pick your least used one

**Hard**: Pull out all your non-perishables

***

Some tips:

**Non-perishables/canned foods**: This includes items in your cupboards

Check for expiration/expiry dates and toss expired foods. Also check for bulging that would indicate bacteria being present on cans and bottles with the specially designed lids. For remaining items

**Perishables**: This includes items in your fridge/freezer

Check expiration/expiry dates and toss anything expired, mushy, or soggy that shouldn't be. Anything you can't remember when you bought it, should probably go. For everything else, [check](http://www.stilltasty.com/) to make sure it's still good, even with a date on it (for instance, meat lasts longer in the freezer than in the fridge under most circumstances).

1371387247.0,1gg9v5,Excuses: are they valid?,Oneinfivepeople,22,4,45,"I've been lurking for a while on this subreddit, mould and food packaging from ingredients I react to and I can't keep being at this stress level any longer. Comments and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Excuse 1: I don't live alone. I share with my husband, lounge and two bathrooms are shared spaces. 

Excuse 2: My mother in law sadly passed away and the entirety of my husbands' belongings from his childhood were moved into our box room when her house was put up for sale. 

Excuse 3: My housemates are all incredibly messy and say that I make them 'feel bad' when I tidy communal spaces. Their belongings in the communal area are a great source of stress to me. I have 'gone on strike' in the past year as I was the only person tidying

Excuse 4: Not wanting to cause horrible tension in my home by arguing with my housemates. Let me give you one example. After one of my housemates moved in last September, so the couch was cleared. The box went onto the floor next to the couch. After Christmas her belongings built up again, but this time I didn't touch them. When Easter came, I gave her another box and it went next to the first. The same happened again with it building up between Easter and beginning of June when she left for the summer break (she's a student). I was made to feel unreasonable for giving her 3 boxes which are still in my living room now. She isn't returning until September so one will have been there for a year. I'm still afraid she will rant and rave if I move them to her bedroom and my husband says I should just leave them alone if they aren't mine. 

Excuse 5: I work long hours and have a very stressful job. By the time I come back and have shopped for food, washed up prep utensils and so on, emptied the recycling outside, done laundry and kept on top of the essential things that I can't do without, decluttering further seems exhausting. 

Excuse 6: My husband had depression and was unemployed for a long time after his mum died. Any talk of asking him to help around the house sent him spiralling away from me as it made him feel 'useless' and was a reminder that he was not contributing in a financial way. He got very upset when things were moved from his system of clutter piled high and he couldn't find something

Excuse 7: Scheduling. Hubs now works nights and couldn't be happier to be contributing and working at what he loves. The shifts we do overlap so that on my time off, the house had to be quiet and I respect their education so I didn't start pulling wardrobes around. Husband still doesn't contribute to cleaning because he believes his full-time job at night and sleeping during the day means he is too busy. The logic of me having had full time work for the last few years seems conveniently forgotten. 

TL;DR I wonder whether my situation is genuinely more difficult than others and if I need to get more serious help

1369694048.0,1f5vsp,Profile of a declutterer: /u/happyeggeater,zencanadian,26,6,11,"The second installment of our new feature interviewing /r/declutter members is with ""happyeggeater""

Questions:

**What point are you at now? Can you say you're clutter-free?** 

Heck no. I've had problems with clutter since I was a kid. I didn't like getting rid of stuff and was always saying I'd attend to things later. You can imagine what my school locker looked like.

I've been working on changing my habits for years. So you can say that I'm a work-in-progress

**What was the turning point that led to you starting to declutter? What inspired you? What makes you want to keep your space clean and clutter-free?**

Clean and uncluttered spaces always made me feel good. I was getting tired of having otherwise beautiful space clogged up with all of my crap. Plus

Now that we have a beautiful new home and a brand new kid, so that made it easier to adapt some of his behaviors. Little things, like only going shopping when I needed something and keeping digital copies of important documents made a pretty significant impact.

**What was easier to do than you thought? What was harder? What is your biggest frustration or pet peeve when it comes to decluttering?**

When I break things down into small accomplishable goals it's easy. The hardest part is just starting. The next hardest is sticking to it. Once I get going, really good.

**Can you tell us about what systems or techniques that you found most useful?**

Starting with small things. Putting things away as soon as possible. Not bringing home things that we don't need. Not keeping things we don't need. Making a designated space for specific things to belong.

My proudest achievement so far is the ""landing strip"" table where we have a dish to collect our stuff as we come in. No more running around searching for keys, this stuff ended up either on the dining table, by the computer, or somewhere else in the house. Now, it's all in that one small dish on an otherwise empty table.

Another thing that's helped is having guests over. There's nothing like the thought of someone coming over to make me want our place looking as nice as possible.

**Is there anything about your space that makes it more challenging to be clutter-free (i.e. lack of cupboards/storage? Too much storage?)?**

We had the baby shortly after we moved in

The stairs make it a little difficult to take loads of stuff down for donating, anything we haul up or down has to be worth the effort.

**What is your decluttering priority at the moment?**

Keeping the kitchen tidy and finding some sort of solution for our paperwork. Right now, or shred pile. We need something better.

**Any other tips for people just getting started in decluttering?** 

Start with a small space and try to keep it uncluttered for a week. Ask yourself if you really need what you have or if it's just taking up space. Donating is fun and the reclaimed space feels great!

**Has /r/declutter helped you at all? In what way/s?** 

Yes! I love that it's a community of people trying to accomplish the same thing while being supportive of one another. It helps keep me motivated and a little accountable.

**Any other sources that have helped or inspired you (books, blogs, etc.)?** 

Books: Organizing from the Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern I've checked this out a bunch of times over the years for inspiration. I haven't yet checked out her new book, but it sounds quite fitting for me right now.

Website: UFYH (Unf**k Your Habitat). This site helped me embrace the idea that I could accomplish a little bit every day and not write myself off as a failure. I find it funny, and a good source of inspiration.

TV: Hoarders. I so don't ever want to be on that show. I watch it every once in a while to get me going on a day-long cleaning spree. It's like listening to rock music before going on a long run. It gets me all charged up and ready to take on a mess.

I’ve done a lot of the more obvious decluttering. I still find things I need to get rid of and there are still layers, I realized I was the more stressed out and unhealthy I had ever been in my life. “But I’m in college, aren’t I having so much fun?” I asked myself. I hung out with one group of friends on Mondays, went to this club meeting on Tuesdays, that club meeting Wednesdays, volunteering on Thursdays, etc. When I really stopped to think about it, but weren’t anymore or I didn’t want to let someone down

As a side note, or seeing people you want to see or learning to play the violin like you’ve been meaning to for years, is something that no amount of money is worth giving up. Money comes and goes, but those moments laughing at the park with your significant other or digging for fossils in your backyard with your kid are moments you can never get back. 

**Any other tips for people just getting started in decluttering?**


1.	It's not a competition. If you, you see posts that are like ""Me &amp; My 100 Possessions"" and then it's like some smug-looking mid-thirties guy sitting in some trendy looking empty apartment with his two shirt and one pair of pants, etc. In my opinion, that's just silly and impractical. If you’re shooting for some number of items, you’re most likely doing it for the wrong reasons. It’s not about how much clutter you have compared to everyone else, but getting to a point that you’re happy with. Everyone has different needs, comforts, or hobbies

2.	Not only does more money and more stuff not make you happy--it oftentimes makes you less happy because it means you are looking in all the wrong places for happiness and fulfillment. It's people and love and friendship and experiences and learning new things and finding out what you're good at and doing that thing, the beverage at hand was probably the least special thing about that night. Similarly, consider Coca-Cola's slogan ""open happiness.""  What you're really opening is a can full of sugary crap, when you could be drinking cool crisp delicious water for free and your body and wallet would be better off for it. When you're at a clothing store and you try on a shirt and it just fantastic on you. “Would I wear it?” you ask yourself. It looks good on you and you would wear it, so you decide to buy it. I'm not saying don't buy it, but I am saying don't buy it and expect it to increase your net happiness. Think of all the shirts you've bought in your lifetime. Aside from that initial rush you may get that first night you step out on the town in your new garb, has any one of those purchases really increases your overall happiness? I'm doubtful.

3.	Using human-powered transportation is pretty much the best thing ever. When I started walking and/or biking to the grocery store, etc. seems a lot less appealing. Aside from helping reduce the clutter in your kitchen, other benefits of using human-powered transportation:
a.	It’s good for you. You burn fat and gain muscle.
b.	It’s good for the environment: It runs on that lasagna you ate earlier instead of fossil fuels.
c.	It’s good for your wallet.
d.	It’s good for the environment. 
Who knows you may even decide you don’t need that second car or even a car at all!

4.	Something nice about decluttering is as you do it, but you'll find you probably have more idle assets sitting around waiting to be liquidated than you originally thought. The more you do it, the more you’ll start to notice a little more cash in your bank account at the end of every month. Some examples from my own experience: 

a.	I bet you never thought of your microwave as an idle asset. I no longer have a microwave and I absolutely love it. I realized that a microwave was just an unnecessary tool to make food preparation more convenient. As I stated above, you’ll get more and more little cash infusions into your bank account. For me, it added up to be quite a bit.

b.	As  I mentioned, I’ve also stopped getting internet in my apartment. It sounds kind of drastic, but after I moved to a new place and while I was waiting for everything to get set up, I realized how nice it was to not have internet. I suddenly had much more time on my hands and was doing things I “hadn’t had time for” before like reading, going for longer walks, starting an herb garden, etc. In addition, when there is something I need to do

c.	I also don’t own a TV nor do I get cable. I didn’t grow up with TV so this wasn’t something I started doing in an effort to declutter, my laptop does the job just fine.



**Has /r/declutter helped you at all?**


By the time I found /r/declutter, I’ve learned a lot about a lot of things including myself. Since I seem to have a lot to say on the topic, I’m actually working on starting a blog based on some of the things I write here! :) I’ll make a post when I feel it’s at a point worthy of sharing. 



**Any other sources that have helped or inspired you (books, blogs, etc.)?**


•	Mr. Money Mustache: This is my favorite blog on the internet. He takes pretty much my life philosophy and puts it in words in a clever, enlightening way. If you haven’t already checked out this blog, you should.

•	/r/minimalism has some pretty good stuff

•	/r/buyitforlife to a degree

•	/r/tinyhouses This subreddit will give you some perspective!



**Any other questions that we should have asked/you want to answer? Any other background info. about you that would be helpful? For example


My parents weren’t hoarders at all. They were pretty neat and we never had EXCESS  stuff.  I did come from an upper middle class family though so much of the stuff they own seems pretty unnecessary to me now looking back. We have a lot of crap in the basement that hasn’t been touched in years, and hodgepodge of bicycles and bicycle parts from when my sister and I were younger that no one ever uses, sports equipment “just in case” anyone feels like going out in the backyard and playing ball which of course no one ever does. 


I can’t think of any questions that should have been asked at the moment

It made me smile because I've had that feeling so many times since I started decluttering.

Good question

That's an issue I've been facing with finding good articles for this subreddit.  I can either look for information on cleaning and organizing a house and I get loads of pinteresty, ""make it work"", ""launch pad"" with maybe a nugget of good advice and a bunch of pretty pictures.  Everyone comes up with their own way to describe things.

Where I've had more luck finding useful terminology is looking at project management

I compare:

* Decluttering tasks to project management.
* Optimizing and Maintenance to system management.
* Family members and roommates to organizational management.

**...what is the official terms for reorganizing/optimizing an area...**

**A [system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System):**

&gt;Some systems share common characteristics

 * A system has [structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure)
 * A system has [behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior)
 * A system has [interconnectivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnectivity): the parts and processes are connected by structural and/or behavioral relationships.
 * A system's structure and behavior may be decomposed via subsystems and sub-processes to elementary parts and process steps.

&gt;The term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure and/or behavior. Alternatively

As you can see I've linked to the top article on systems and from there you can find loads of helpful vocabulary that will help you evaluate each area you mention.

1361782276.0,196mu9,MERGE IT Monday: Daily Decluttering Theme,parle,13,0,21,"Hi! Today is Monday

Today is the day to fight entropy! That's right declutters

Things will disperse themselves so that there is an optimal amount of space between them. [Here's a nice illustration of what I mean.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Entropie.png) Or just think of a two-year old's room after playing with blocks. 

So you know that clutter you are dealing with, books, articles of clothing, and so on, well it wants to disperse. 

So I have two ways to deal with this:

**Everything has its place and one place for each thing.**

 * Ideally I know where each thing belongs. When it is not being used it is in that place. When it is being used that place stays empty waiting for it. 
 * One place for each item means that I only have one place to find it, one place to tell other people where it is and where to put it back. That means I no longer have scissors in every drawer in the house. I have one drawer with scissors in it. ""Oh,"" I said, ""but it is so useful to have my scissors right there whenever I think of scissors."" However it was seldom the case, scissors migrated (entropy) and soon I had 3 scissors in one drawer and none in the other. 


**If you can't find it you can't use it.**

 * It's great having backups, no, then try the closet, no then try the other drawer, hmmm it's here somewhere. 
 * You can keep anything as long as it is in its place and is labelled. 


**Things to merge:**

 *  I'll fill this in as people leave comments about what they have been doing. 

**What about you?**

 * Look around the room
 * Ask questions about the best way to store something
 * Please post any merging sucesses/disappointments in the comments.  (You don't have to have done it on a Monday.)
 * Links to articles about merging

I am in the process of cutting the clutter out of our garage and have hit a stumbling block...

My roomies like to hold onto boxes that products were purchased in. Not all products but our nice/pricey items. We have the boxes for our TV, and things of this nature.

The consensus is ""Well if we need to move it's better to have the original boxes"". Should I just go along with that mentality and use these random cardboard(ish) boxes for storage? Is it better to get rid of them than to have them sit around for a someday move? We don't plan on moving anytime in the next 2-3 years..

Today is the day to sell items that you don't want

I find selling to be one of the hardest decluttering tasks

Selling secondhand things is a learning process. So let's use this thread to talk about where and when you have had success selling what type of things.

Some things that have helped me:
 
 * **Think of the value of your space.** I use real estate prices to help me with this. For example

 * **Most things depreciate in value immediately after leaving the store.** And you now have the work of making it look good without a marketing budget. [How to find the sale value of an item.](http://www.ehow.com/how_5676678_determine-sale-value-used-goods.html)

 * **[Sunk Costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs)** It is still hard for me to come to terms with this. One positive side of it


**Things to sell and where to sell them:**

 * **Any item:**
  * [garage/yard sale](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/12/a-yard-sale-checklist-ten-tips-for-garage-sale-prep/)
  * [ebay](http://www.squidoo.com/ebay-selling-advice)

 * **Used Books:**   
  * [US site bookscouter](http://bookscouter.com/) (disclaimer: I never tried this one. I just googled it. Please suggest other ones for the US or other countries in the comments) 

 * **Used Clothes:**
  * Find a local consignement shop. You usually need to call to make an appointment. Brand names usually resell the best.
  * On ebay you can sell clothes bundles. When my child outgrew clothes

**What about you?**

 * What do you sell? How do you sell it? Where do you sell it?

You've decluttered and you made your space more livable. Good Work! Half the battle is done.

You merged items on MERGE IT Monday and found that you don't need 20 old socks with holes in them. You went through a box on STORE IT Saturday

So now

But where? If you are like me then throwing a perfectly good item into the trashcan will make you feel naseuous. So I avoid the trash as much as possible. Here is what I do:

**Where to TAKE OUT your stuff to (In order of preference):**
 
 * **These are the People in Your Neighborhood** - Always call ahead and ask if they need an item that you have. If they don't
   * Schools, hospitals will want your old button-down shirts (to make smocks out of), old books, old board games, old toys, cds, dvds, supplies for arts and crafts.
   * Women's shelters, clothes, toiletries.
   * Animal shelters will want your old towels and sheets.
   * Some organizations do recycling drives. They collect small amounts of scrap metal and then bring it in for money. 

 * **Charitable Organizations:** Here's a few links to the well known places to donate. Oh and when you call they often come to pick it up
   * [Goodwill](http://www.goodwill.org/)
   * [Donate Household Appliances](http://www.geappliances.com/service_and_support/donation.htm)
   * [Habitat REStores](http://www.habitat.org/getinv/materials_donations.aspx)
   * [Platelets](http://www.redcrossblood.org/) - The Red Cross doesn't accept small quantities of household goods donations. But you can sell items on their ebay site [Giving Works](http://givingworks.ebay.com/)
   * [Oxfam](http://www.oxfam.org/)
   * [An article listing more places including verterans and soliders](http://www.missminimalist.com/2011/04/where-to-donate-your-stuff-101-places-your-clutter-can-do-good/)
   * ~~The Salvation Army~~ *[Read why this is crossed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/19a078/take_it_out_tuesday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8r5qy9)*

 * **Recycle:** 
   * I'll be happy to list links here or advice about certain items. Basically what I do is look on my town's website or google the item and recycle or disposal. 

**What about you?**

 * How do you get rid of stuff?  
 * Non-US redditors: What about in your country? Where are the best places to donate to?
 * Ask questions about items you'd like to get rid of?
 * Add ideas for donations.
 * Please post any donation related sucesses in the comments. Show us a picture. (You don't have to have done it on a Tuesday.)

 * Sentimental Stuff: A cheap carnival toy won by an ex-ex-ex-boyfriend in the first week we started dating. Stored away in a place I hardly ever look. Each time I see it, but he was a nice guy. I've had nice dates since then, but that was a nice date. It's such a small little toy...back in the drawer.

This week, I found that I had been figuring out things in my head all week and knew where each item should go. 

 * I sent 4 bags of children's clothes to work with my husband for a colleague's kid who was born a few days apart from mine 2 year later. That means everything should be a perfect fit.
 * I packed up 2 boxes of extra bed linens for the local assisted living house. 
 * I packed 2 boxes of ""treasures"" of things I don't need... but I like but... I don't have space for and labelled them ""fleamarket 2013"". They can sit there for a week or two and then I will go through them again. I'll see if anything is good for ebay. If by the end of 2013 I haven't done anything with them
 * I also made the bed in my step-kid's room. It has been under a pile of my sorted-out stuff for at least 6 weeks now. She's been traveling for the last 4 months and is planning to be back in 2 months. I have that long to make my final decisions about the items. It's important to me that her space is not a ""storage room"". She decides often on short notice when she wants to stay with us and I want her to know she always has space with us.
