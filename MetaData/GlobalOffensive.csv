Note that this story is still developing:
ESEA Statement has been released! Full post at the bottom of this post or click here to read on esea.net
ESEA Member unisolsz discovered that the client required to play on ESEA was running a bitcoin miner. After players were complaining about virus alerts being set off from the client and unusually high GPU usage and BSOD errors.

The thread he made regarding this can be found here

ESEA admin

He later corrects that it was running for 2+ weeks and actually raised 29~ bitcoins (around $3

Bitcoin miners use up 100% of GPU processes and lead to a lowered hardware lifespan

Link to /r/GlobalOffensive discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dgad2/esea_client_basically_a_virus/

UPDATE: Someone has pointed out that the bitcoin address that lpkane posted a picture of in his first post is different compared to the address he lists in his second post. Very strange...

UPDATE #2: I should clarify that no one that was affected lost any money of their own. It was a poor choice of words for me to say that he 'stole' the money. I was referring to the fact that people that were affected most likely saw an increase in electricity usage

UPDATE #3: I was contacted by /u/GGTY886 that informed me that he had posted a thread regarding the mining two hours before unisolsz had posted his that was locked by an admin. Located here

There is also a thread located here by a user that discusses the symptoms of the miner.

He also sent me a recording of a conversation with an ESEA admin discussing the issue which can be listened to here: The Recording

His PM in full in case you're interested:
I actually posted a thread before unisolz that actually exposed the bitcoin mining. http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492064
I posted 2 hours before his thread
Also

UPDATE #4: Others have pointed out that this isn't the first time lpkane has mentioned mining bitcoins through the ESEA client: http://i.imgur.com/yvMX2DY.png

UPDATE #5: In a thread dated 4/9/2013

UPDATE #7: Another image that was requested to be added to the OP showing lpkane's comments on bitcoin mining on September 18th

UPDATE #8: Craig Levine ""Torbull"" (owner of ESEA) has posted this statement on the forums regarding the situation:

The first I learned about any of this was last night (on any scale). I had no idea any of this was going on.
Needless to say I am completely embarrassed
For the past ten years
I'm wrapping my mind around this whole thing and we'll release a formal response
I'm committed to doing whatever possible to rebuild the trust we lost through this whole fiasco.
Source Post #608

Some more information from Craig:

Post #632:

It's a failure on my part to have the proper oversight to have prevented this from happening and it will be addressed.

My primary concern at this point is community trust and how that was destroyed. We need to understand the situation, and address anyone who incurred physical damages.

How we rebuild the trust of the community in the immediate aftermath and long term future is going to be a different discussion that we need to have as I walk through this all.

Post #710:

Standby for a more formal response with information about the situation and recourse for those impacted.

Post #742:

the facts of the situation are beyond what has been shared to this point.
We're going to do everything in our power to address the issue of what happened, but this is obviously something we take incredibly serious.

Post #802:

the money will be going somewhere much more righteous than the prize purse in addition to the prize purse

Post #810:

why would we risk our business and livelihood on making some inconsequential amount of money on Bitcoins
I assure you that I and the larger ESEA entity had no knowledge of this. We're working to figure out what happened to respond accordingly.

Post #829:

His (lpkane's) response there was done more playfully than seriously. We would never knowingly allow this to be done to our community and I'm looking into all of the details for how this happened.

Post #886:

We will be setting up a mechanism to address anyone who's computer parts were damaged through this process

UPDATE #9: /u/PrincessChoadzilla has posted a analysis of the three bitcoin addresses ESEA admins used to collect the bitcoins here and found that there has been 1 bitcoin that is still not accounted for by lpkane.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: ESEA Statement has been released:

Throughout the history of gaming and e-sports, event organizers, and even “sponsors.” Over the past ten years ESEA has prided itself on being an upstanding member of the gaming community by providing a high quality service, paying out prize money, and being upfront and transparent with you, the community. We worked hard to build your trust and often took the longer, slower

ESEA’s goal is to provide our community with cutting edge technology and tools. Whenever possible, consenting administrators’ accounts to see how the mining process worked and determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future. We thought this might be an exciting new tool that we could provide to our community. Ultimately, we decided that it was not.

On April 13, ESEA informed those involved in the test that we were killing the project and they should stop using the beta test. It came to our attention last night, however, that an employee who was involved in the test has been using the test code for his own personal gain since April 13, 2013. What transpired the past two weeks is a case of an employee acting on his own and without authorization to access our community through our company’s resources. We are extremely disappointed and concerned by the unauthorized actions of this unauthorized individual. As of this morning, ESEA has made sure that all Bitcoin mining has stopped. ESEA is also in the process of taking all necessary steps internally to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.
The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right. ESEA has issued a free month of ESEA Premium to all of our community members who were enrolled in Premium for the month of April. We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket.

In an effort to maintain complete transparency,713.55 to the American Cancer Society. ESEA will also match 100% of this amount for a total of $7,427.10 donated. ESEA is also increasing the Season 14 League prize pot by $3,713.50.

[Full Gallery](http://thegoshow.tv/map-call-spots/)

**Please note** that I did my best to provide the most common names for these spots. A lot of teams make up their own

**Map Notes**

Any call-out that is a light grey (instead of white) is underneath what the overlay is showing. For example ""Underpass"" on Mirage is underground and below where ladder room connects to catwalk

One spot on a few maps were not named by the many players we polled. We felt they were important calls

Nuke's lower level is separated and accentuated on the bottom left of the image.

Season's overview was pulled from the map .dds file just as the others were

We only created overviews for the maps that are commonly played competitively. As more maps are completed

**Dust2: Separated Catwalk, as there is a huge difference between someone on Short A near A Plat, and someone on Catwalk, just past ""Palm"", and players should be able to easily differentiate. ""Catwalk"" is named such because catwalks are usually thinner just as that area is. ""Cat"" breaks off from Catwalk. ""Short A"" is parallel to Long A, and is indeed shorter.
Added ""Cat Boost"".
Kept ""Palm"" despite the palm tree being removed in GO, and e-pole sounds weird. Actually I kind of like it, you can use that if you want.
Had no solid name for ""B Boxes"". Used ""B Boxes as all other boxes in B were named
Side of Pit and Pit Plat didn't necessarily have names with anyone that we polled

**New Mirage:**
Separated Catwalk and B Cat.
Created E-Stairs to replace E-Box due to landscape change and to differentiate from E-Box at B.
Gave ""Van"" in B a new name as ""Crates"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.
Gave ""Cart"" at the top of middle a new name

**Cache:**
B site's ""Corner"" was named instead of ""back site"" or ""deep site"" per the input of several competitive players.
Headshot Box is below Balcony in A

**Inferno:**
""Mexican"" or ""Mexi-Pit"" were not used on purpose
We opted to use several Source names as the maps in GO are very similar to Source when compared to 1.6.
""Tri-Box"" from 1.6 is named New Box as it was in Source.
""2nd"" is named 2nd instead of fruit
""Patio"" is also Quad for many players.
""Close"" on arch side mid is Close left and had no name according to players we polled.
""Construction"" was chosen over ruins.
""Spools"" were chosen over spindles or coils. We used Spools to stay consistent with other maps.
""Well""
T-Apartments go through to the kitchen area as well. These are low-action areas and are rarely called.
Separated Kitchen and Library.

**Nuke:**
As stated previously we outlined the very transparent lower routes / bomb site and put them in a key on the bottom left of the full image. The main section of the image holds the upper bomb site.
Locker is underneath the red roof that holds Heaven and Catwalk up.
Red is a general call on ramp, for example ""Catwalk above Toxic"". Do the same for Rafters in Upper. ie. ""Rafters above Hut"", ""Rafters above Mini"".

**Train:**
A1, 5, 6 in 1.6, but are now labelled in GO, and will be 1, 2,3. Some inner trains have been removed in GO,2, 3-Train.
Boilers is also called as ""upper"" but was separated to be more specific.
Up ladder and down ladder can also be ladder room
Pop Dog was a 1.6 name
E-box is also known as Electric.

**Season:** Green and Blue in the A site had different names,,False,self,t5_2sqho,1372874644.0,,True

If LoL, and SC2 players are the lavish lands of the South and West, we are the Mongols of the North by now: fierce, prone to infighting amongst ourselves, sarcastic, and jaded with most offers of a surge in our Counter-Strike fortunes.  And continuously, we look for some mythical Genghis Khan to come over the fold and lead us on to mainstream eSports stardom: Valve, ESEA

I don't know if this is the end of our Indian summer...or the beginning of something great.  But like the child who is not the apple of their parents' eye, not because we believe in a full-time CS:GO oriented Valve employee (which would most likely defy reason and probability), but because we need that voice in the night that says ""I hear.  I am here.""

I don't want to wake up with a Macedonian flag added into my game.  At least

There are a few core elements from the game missing, with a high skill ceiling and a respect for the intelligence and wits of the average competitive player.  I will stress one thing here that many don't: *movement.*  Seriously one of the largest fractals in the Counter-Strike vision has been diminished with GO, meaning that many talented movers and jumpers can't contribute to the realm of competitive play.

Here is the current version based on everybody's feedback (download it [here](http://www.fileswap.com/dl/GeO2Op2TIG/) )
Here are the values

* Damage: 63 -&gt; 40 (decreased because other parameters were tweaked for better accuracy - still best of all the pistols)
* RangeModifier: 0.81 -&gt; 0.92 (increased to guarantee headshot kills at long range - best of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyStand: 7.70 -&gt; 5.70 (decreased for better long range hs and to match with other pistols - third best of the pistols)
* InaccuracyJump: 1.966 -&gt; 0.966 (decreased to match other pistols values - still worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyLand: 0.770 -&gt; 0.330 (decreased to match other pistols values - still worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyFire: 72.23 -&gt; 150.23 (increased this value - will add inaccuracy when SPAMMING fire button - by far the worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyMove: 48.10 -&gt; 26.10 (increased mobility because we should use it not only while standing and to match other pistols - still worst of all the pistols)
* RecoveryTimeCrouch: 0.489927 -&gt; 0.42 (decreased because the recoil took too long to reset - still second worst of all the pistols)
* RecoveryTimeStand: 0.8912 -&gt; 0.46 (decreased because the recoil took too long to reset - still of all the pistols)
* RecoilAngleVariance: 60 -&gt; 30  (reduces angle variance in recoil magnitude - still second worst of all the pistols - Note that this is a buff
* RecoilMagnitudeVariance: 18 -&gt; 11 (reduces variance in recoil magnitude - still worst of all the pistols - Note that this is a buff

It also has 
the best WeaponArmorRatio
the worst WeaponPrice
the worst ClipSize and 
the worst CycleTime values.
You can see that it is definitely not overpowered.

Below are the exact damage values for it:
range 128 units (3 hit kill):
39 no kevlar chest
48 no kevlar lower body
45 kevlar lower body
36 kevlar chest

range 256 units (3 hit kill):
38 no kevlar chest
47 no kevlar lower body
35 kevlar chest
44 kevlar lower body

range 512 units (3 hit kill):
36 no kevlar chest
45 no kevlar lower body
34 kevlar chest
42 kevlar lower body

range 1024 units(3-4 hit kill):
33 no kevlar chest
42 no kevlar lower body
31 kevlar chest
39 kevlar lower body

range 2048 units (3-4 hit kill)
28 no kevlar chest
35 no kevlar lower body
26 kevlar chest
33 kevlar lower body

1 headshot kill range with armor: 2395 units
1 headshot kill range without armor: 2818 units
(basically any range)

For comparison:

Credit to micronn(aka majkelDre) for most of this post!

These values might be adjusted some more but the idea behind it is this:
We reduced the damage so that it is a 3 hit kill at close range and 3-4 hits at long range against armored opponents. The 1 headshot kill range is very long however and the inaccuracy when standing has been reduced to give better accuracy on the first shot while also reducing the insane recovery time to make it viable and to allow for multiple headshots again (it's still hard though). Spamming mouse1 with it is not rewarded because the InaccuracyFire is so high.

This Deagle is great for precisely aimed headshots at any range

Everybody please head over to the Steam Forum thread

Thanks!

Update: Here is a video of me testing the accuracy because people are concerned about added randomness due to the InaccuracyFire increase: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W4x3VhvW84
You can see that the randomness is only significant when you spam the fire button. 
IMPORTANT: This effect is negligible at a closer range and is NOT worse than the current Deagle due to the reduction of the recoil variance(randomness) and the decrease in inaccuracy when standing or moving in this version! This version is actually LESS random/MORE accurate when standing still/moving and at low rates of fire. Max accuracy is also regained significantly faster.",self,t5_2sqho,1373244938.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1hsxx0/better_but_balanced_deagle_please_help_us_get/

So what's the solution? In order for the CS community to grow to its full potential we need an alternative

**Valve must step in and invest the time and money to create a quality system to replace ESEA**. Surely they must see after this whole fiasco that they can no longer trust their competitive scene to third parties. Maybe they're working on this

To be clear, so if someone needs some help in that area I'm willing to spend a lot of time on this.

Slowly and truely masterful he began sucking. Even the last CT was unable to do something else than admire this example of manlove. The only words that came across his seweet lips were: ""WTF kind of mod is this?""

And just as the bomb exploded, in this very minute Gaben appeared and everything went silent, I was not even able to hear [MLG]1337_SMOKE420 masturbate while licking cum.


and the following is what Gaben said:""You, I shall give you Half-Life 3""

This was the most glorious day of my life.

In a patch a while ago they made it so aim punch only affects unarmored and hits in the chest which was a nice change that made the game more consistent but I don't think its enough.  1 on 1 battles are ruined in this game because whoever has armor practically wins before the figth even starts and if they both don't have armor, especially on those pistol rounds where you're trading blows from across the map.(being that CT window guy on mirage on pistold round that gets shot once in the chest and has to deal with the random aim and has to pretty much retreat is very frustrating)

I think aim punch should only be a thing if you don't have head armor and you get gooshed but it should be much more temporary than it is right now and I'd almost argue a goosh should forcefully move your crosshair rather than change your recoil without providing any feedback to the player that their shots are now in a random state.  I mean that's really just one of the issues of aim punch is that **people don't even *know* they are being aim punched.**  Its hard enough to see where your bullets are going so instead of even knowing that aim punch is causing them to miss

Aim punch should not be a regular occurrence because it just makes any fight without armor a bit more random and it makes armor far too important.  The days of weighing our money and figuring out whether we can afford to play without armor so that we can buy more nades are over.  That 3k-3.5k buy on T side isn't as viable because if you don't have armor

So I'm really just hoping here that Valve, more skill based, if they reduce aim punch to only getting gooshed without head armor.  Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2sqho,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i2dpg/valve_its_time_to_remove_aim_punch_from_chest/

The USP doesn't compare well with any T pistol, glock with 140 bullets total to utilize while the USP is left with 36 total.

We performed most recent tests with the author of this reddit thread
http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dueje/stutterrubber_banding_still_torturing_me/
and here's what we observed.

**Test configuration**
His 128-tick server running dust2_se
Both of us have cl_updaterate 128, fps consistently exceeding 150 fps
Upstream and downstream bandwidth sufficiently greater than 15 KB/s
One player in the test runs along Long A area

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 0**
This results in server movement control feature being turned off similar to how it was in the pre-May build.
DustyWJ running Long A: On his screen he moves smoothly while running. On my screen he moves 5-8 steps, then teleports the width of A-ramp box, and so on.
When I am running Long A I see myself running smoothly on my screen and he sees me running smoothly on his screen.

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 3**
This results in server movement control allowing for 3/128th of a second fluctuations in client's command stream = 23 ms ping fluctuations.
DustyWJ running Long A: On his screen he stutters back every several steps. On my screen he moves 1-2 steps, brief stop, and so on.
When I am running Long A I see myself running smoothly on my screen and he sees me running smoothly on his screen.

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 36**
This results in server movement control allowing for 36/128th of a second fluctuations in client's command stream = 280 ms ping fluctuations.
This is the borderline value for DustyWJ running Long A and not seeing himself stuttering back. On my screen he teleports the width of A-ramp box just as in the case of having the convar value set to 0.
280 ms x 250 units/sec knife movement speed = 70 in ~= 6 feet (~2 meters) of in-game distance of teleportation.
Any value lower than 36 will have DustyWJ observe slight stuttering and his net_graph 5 in bottom section will spike into red when stutter occurs. Also as the value gets reduced down from 36 I will be seeing his character teleporting shorter distances on my screen.

**Summary**
Any non-zero value for the convar up (e.g. 256) will eliminate ""speedhacking"" because clients will not be able to stuff in more than

The maximum teleportation distance that a player with poor network routing will achieve is mathematically equal to ( (sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks / tickrate) x MovementSpeed ) and server operators are free to configure servers to optimize for maximum teleporting distance their players and/or league can tolerate.

It was unfortunate that the most recent update found many people not having a sufficient network connection to maintain the required packet frequency for the servers

The upcoming Wednesday update will increase the default value of the convar to 16 allowing a default experience of max 2.6ft (~80 centimeters) teleportation on 128-tick servers and thus arriving at a good default compromise for people not to stutter on local clients and not to cause too much teleporting from enemies' perspective as their network latency conditions or packet drops fluctuate by +125 ms. All Valve servers will also have the settings providing an equivalent movement restriction in 64-tickrate conditions.

DustyWJ will be running some traces to pinpoint which piece of his network between his client and his server was causing networking hitches and hopefully will be able to share some information with the community.

I hope this answers a lot of questions that the community had after the most recent update and provides some technical details about tickrate and latency to help server administrators understand the details of how these settings affect players.

1367016696.0,1d6nei,Competitive Community Wishlist,FrooshGOShow,178,33,90,"There have been some really great posts on this sub-reddit in the past 24 hours (ie. [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1d5och/the_future_of_cs_in_light_of_operation_payback_an/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1d4k33/why_i_like_operation_payback/).)

I thought it might be nice to create a collective wishlist for the competitive global offensive scene. The bullet points below are written as suggestions

**Please feel free to comment and add your thoughts

**Wishlist**

* **""Tournament Standard"" applied to MM** - Matchmaking is a fantastic idea,000 threads already, but the tournament standard would be, 128 tic, 2 flashes, 1:45 round timer, _se maps, we would like to see the ability to re-fill an abandoned spot, we should be able to re-fill that spot mid-scrim. This would mean that if you queued as 5 players

* **Brand New Competitive Maps** - Beta test and make changes based on pro/high level feedback. You can make a new map for MM

* **Revamped Replay/Demo System** - I think this isn't discussed enough, fast forward, potentially allowing you to pick which round to skip to. It would also be nice to be able to pause a demo, and still use freelook and other functions. I understand there is NO way the current demo system could handle that, but that's why it needs to be remade/revamped. GOTV was a huge improvement, but the demo system needs more improving. We don't have enough content creators doing analysis, and most of the analysis that is done is not very good, and I believe it's because the demo system makes it near impossible to be efficient. More content means a more involved community

* **Gun Updates** - I don't think I need to go into a lot of detail about this, I understand that CT's have less powerful guns for a reason, it's not a viable option for CT's (especially if you keep the Glock how it is now, and I actually love the glock right now). I'm not going to say anything about the deagle. I think the P90 needs any ONE of the following - needs to be more expensive, or needs to lower the kill reward, or needs to be nerfed with shooting speed, or damage.

* **Minor HUD changes** - The visibility of alive/dead players, possibly allow us to change the opacity, and allow us to customize where each HUD component is placed.

* **VAC changes** - We all know there are cheaters in this game

**Added from comments**

* More organized, and view statistics on that match. (someone who plays dota2 please comment!) - watchspade

* Minor Mag7 nerf. It's great to have a gun that gives you a chance on eco rounds

* Reduce weapon-switch time - xfake

* Remove scope blur - xfake

* More MM servers in more locations - breul99

* Improve VAC by Valve downloading the cheats

* Aim-punch and smokes going through solid walls need fixing - dfoxcs

Things I left out on purpose

* ADADAD - Because there is discussion that it's the same as any bug we abused in 1.6 and source. I bet if crouch jumping never existed in 1.6

* The Deagle - Because sometimes I can't tell whether I hate it because it sucks

* Silencers - Because there is more to it than ""it takes an hour to code this"". It's about balance, not something that will help the community grow.",,False,self,t5_2sqho,1367050502.0,,

1373165503.0,1hs7ci,Possible new movement values,m0rd0ck,170,28,148,"Hey guys

You might remember about J3DI trying to do something like this a couple of months ago at cadred.

He couldnt reach a consensus with the pro community as they had very different views of how movement should be handled.

He did however say at the SPUF that the community should try and come up with some values and approach valve with them when we reached an agreement of what the best values are.

After a couple of failed attempts

We started by just trying to make GOs movement feel good, instead of throwing numbers into the air and hoping they worked, we decided to get one of the previous games movement acceleration curve.

we turned to 1.6 for inspiration

we managed to get both 1.6 and GOs acceleration curve

After that we got 1.6 movement down

You can check the movement acceleration curve of every combination and a quick analysis bellow

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7uwC6JTkveudW5SZmFSYW5INDg/

-Compared to 1.6

1)sv_friction 4.5 | sv_accelerate 4.8 gets the initial acceleration values right but then takes too long to reach full speed.(green line on the graphic)

2)sv_friction 4.9 | sv_accelerate 5.35 is in-between GO and 1.6

3)sv_friction 4 | sv_accelerate 5 is the one closer to 1.6

4)sv_friction 4 | sv_accelerate 4.6


You have the values and the graphical representation of them.

all its left is for you guys to test it out


Give them a try and share your thoughts...we got to do this together if we want to be heard...

**Putting a spray in your CS:GO folder**

* First off
   
&gt;\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike GlobalOffensive\csgo\materials\vgui\

* Make a folder named ""logos"". 

* You need to get a .vtf spray image to put into the logos folder. You can find one on FPS Banana or make your own. 

* After you do that and once you’re in game

&gt;bind ""t"" ""cl_playerspraydisable 0; impulse 201""


Note: ""t"" is the key you use to bind the spray. Whatever you bind it to should be your new spray key in-game.


This last line is vital to your spray working properly. Make sure you type what the name of your spray is in the &lt;sprayname&gt; field when you enter this into the console.

&gt;cl_logofile ""materials/vgui/logos/&lt;sprayname&gt;.vtf""




**To make your own spray**

* Open Photoshop or any similar program. Create a blank 256×256 RGB 8-bit image.
* Fill this image with mid-grey R 128
* Create a new layer on top of this
* Press CTRL and click the layer you’re drawing on in the layers palate. This selects only what you’ve drawn onto the layer.
* On the Channels tab
* Go back to the layers tab. Click Layer-&gt;Flatten Image.
* Now save the image as a TGA file
* Open VTF Edit. Go to File-&gt;Import and select your TGA file. (If you don’t have VTF Edit
* In the dialog that appears
* To confirm that your TGA alpha map worked okay
* Go to File-&gt;Save As and save the file. It is now ready to be placed in the ""logos"" folder you have previously created in your CS:GO folder.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**BASIC FAQ**

---------------------------------------------------------------
**What is an autoexec.cfg?**

The autoexec is basically a list of commands run at the start of Counter-Strike. Autoexec = *Auto*matically *exec*uted.

**How do I create an autoexec?**

First you go to *\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\*. In this cfg-folder you create a new text document (.txt) and change it from ""New Text Document.txt"" to ""autoexec.cfg"". Done!

**How do I edit the autoexec.cfg?**

Right-click on the autoexec.cfg and click ""Open with..."" and select ""notepad"" under Other programs. Now you can easily add new commands to the cfg. Click File -&gt; Safe whenever you're done.

**How do I get the console to show up in CS:GO?**

It's basically the same as in CSS. Open your Steam Library, in the upcoming window on ""SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."" and write ""-console"" (without the """") in the text-field. After that you just have to click ""Ok"", ""Close"" and start CS:GO.

**Help! The autoexec isn't executed on startup!**

This seems to be a known problem with no ""works everytime"" solution yet. You can try out to either:

a) execute the autoexec by entering the command ""exec autoexec"" (without the """") in your console. (thanks

b) enter all commands into your config.cfg instead of your autoexec.cfg.

c) put the command ""exec autoexec"" (again without the """") at the end of your config.cfg. (thanks

d) add ""+exec autoexec"" to the launch options (with console activated it should read ""-console +exec autoexec""). (thanks

---------------------------------------------------------------

**USEFUL AUTOEXEC COMMANDS:**

You see

Monopolies rarely work out to the favor the market. Around September I began playing with the idea of challenging ESEA's monopoly as a free alternative. I was willing to invest money into a project that could and would combat ESEA's market share and dominant hold on the community. Unfortunately

This free service could compete on almost every level of ESEA. Better administration, and comparable server quality to ESEA's service. Specifically, I could not find a developer with the ability and willingness to roll out a constant stream of AC updates. Of course, ironically, it was that same AC system that has become the bane of ESEA. These past 24 hours have been a bizarre roller coaster ride of investigation. I'm not here to talk about ESEA.

Apparently, they found a way to fill the AC problem that I could not. Whether it is as effective as ESEA I do not know.

So

1. What is stopping you from using Leetway? What can't they offer that ESEA does?

2. Do you think there's room for yet another pug/league/scrim service different from ESEA and Leetway? If so

1374180526.0,1il2sr,New Community movement Update!,m0rd0ck,135,17,100,"Hey guys

Here's an update on the community movement.


Right now I'm working with a former CS:S Pro player on this. His name is Heffrey ""godFrey"" Brauer.

We are in contact with some sites to push the community initiative forward. This guy knows a lot of people from the different communities

As you guys may remember, The fallowing article will be featured on both HLTV and ESEA News, and its about the community work, check it out! ;)

you have the new values bellow in a chart
http://s15.postimg.org/7w3pxjgqj/movement.png


""Hello everyone

I am Heffrey ""godFrey"" Brauer, sv_airaccelerate), which we now have after a lot of work. In this article we will break down each of our goals, explain why this is a problem, and how we fixed it.

Here are the new values:

sv_friction ""4.1""
sv_accelerate ""4.8""
sv_airaccelerate ""16""

Here is the list of goals we had:

1. Making movement acceleration more balanced
2. Making acceleration more fitting to the scale of the world.
3. Balance peaking so it cannot be exploited due to increased acceleration
4. Making it easier for the eyes to recognize targets whilst moving.
5. Making tagging effect increased due to the lack of wallbanging aswell as the small hitboxes.
6. Maintaining the ability to jump the same lengths and heights as before despite the changes in acceleration (silo jump etc. still possible).


These were the goals


1: The thing about the new movement model is that only the top speed differentiates at the swap of a weapon


2: Considering the model size and the scale of the world/map, however this is justified by the bigger hitboxes and more manageable recoil. In order to fix this we reduced the acceleration to balance the movement, making it more fitting to the scale of the world.


3: With the current acceleration it is near impossible to hold angles and the peakers have a clear advantage due to the fast acceleration aswell as the mild tagging. Running around corners have never been easier aswell as getting away from a gunfire. In order to fix this we reduced the acceleration and the results were great. With the new values it is now much more doable to hold angles effectively


4: Accelerating fast also has another down side. When moving around a corner or out into a new open space, but also makes it easier to recognize targets at long range as you come around a corner.


5: With fast acceleration, which helps him/her in the escaping of gunfire. To balance this, we have reduced the acceleration and with that follows increased tagging effect, resulting in a less biased and more balanced game.


6: Despite the fact that acceleration is reduced


Movement is a major gameplay mechanic, and acceleration has to be just right so that other gameplay mechanics aren't compromised by it. Therefore we have approached this subject very seriously and we are confident that with these values, the game will be better. The change will provide more balance to the game, it will make it far more competitive and less ""random"" - Competitive because it opens up for more effective angle holding aswell with the different advantages granted by faster acceleration being removed, a more strategic approach is required. Worth mentioning is that Counter-Strike is a tactical shooter, not a fast paced shooter like Quake and others.


With the current CSGO settings you will need to be very observant and fast in order to pickup on all the things exposed to your eyes at once. With the new settings, whilst at the same time the action becomes smoother, also the exposure becomes more progressive rather than instant. By reducing acceleration it makes it harder to get away after you commit to peaking, and the increased tagging effect makes it near impossible to get away once you engage. This makes it once again possible to hold angles effectively and wont allow the peaker to exploit the advantages granted by fast acceleration, such as mild tagging, re-peaking at a rate faster than the majority's reactions and escaping.


To wrap things up I would like to say that this is far from the end of the journey. This is our final values and they are not subject to change. However we wont stop there, Valve has their eyes on our project and progress.


As my final words I want to say that we are currently working on a concept for a tournament with CEVO (Cyber Evolution) and if everything goes well more information will come soon. I would like to thank Michal ""micron"" D. for his work on the spreadsheets we have put our past and current results in, Chris Pipher, Luis ""MIRAA"" Mira, Matt Wood, also big shout out and thank you to Ben ""SolobeN"" Farquhar for his help with the video and ofcourse, Luis ""M0rD0cK"" Chaveiro. Last but definately not least, on behalf of me and everybody involved with this project, keep it coming - the more the better!


Best regards
Heffrey Brauer.""

1374847850.0,1j3ija,A few tips to newer players that want to improve their game (around nova/guardian),sur_stromming,137,22,80,"Well

So here are a few things you need to consider if you want to start winning some more rounds (and this is my opinion, just what i consider to be most reasonable but other people don't do):

* Don't reload your AK M4 or whatever you're wielding if it has more than 15 bullets left. If your aim is perfect 15 bullets are enough to kill 15 opponentsl If your aim is terrible 15 bullets are still enough to kill 1 enemy. Only reload if your gun is empty or if you are sure you are safe (e.g. all enemies spotted

* Also the opposite is true. If you're safe and your gun is empty rather reload it than swing around the corner with your deagle and try to spray 2 enemies with 7 bullets. Take a split second to reflect if you're safe. If you're stuck in a 1v1 and you need to defuse but the bomb just got planted the 2 seconds reloading most likely won't make the bomb go off (timer is 45 i think) but your chance of killing him and then defusing are skyrocketting.

* Most maps are not that big and you walk hella fast in CSGO. If you're the last T and got the bomb and you know both CT's alive are on A think if there is a safe route to B instead. 30 seconds is more than enough to run from inferno appartments all the way down second mid through banana again. If you can smoke ct spawn it will guarantee you at least a safe plant. If one rotates early you'll end up in a 1v1 which is still better than a 1v2.

* If you're CT and stuck in a 2v1

* If you're CT and the T's dropped the bomb try to set up a reasonable defense around the bomb instead of go hunt the remaining T's (at least 3 rounds every game lost because of this)

* If you try to take over or retake a bomb site try to hit from all angles at the same time. It happens way too often that a 1 after 1 after 1 gets killed by the last remaining enemy.

* Dr. Strangelove or how I stopped worrying and planting the bomb correctly:
Try to cover the planter as good as possible. I die every game at least once because some mate yells ""omg plant plant"" and I'll plant and get killed out of vents on B nuke although I have 3 mates nearby.
Try to think about good timings when to plant a bomb. If you sneak into a site and see CT's rotating away
Try to think about where to plant the bomb. Are you covered? Plant in the open where you will have the best chance to shoot the defuser. Is the timer a problem or are you not covered

* If people die and you see the X AWP'd Y notification in the top right corner try to instantly look at the minimap to see where he died. Since people don't communicate as much you won't run into the same awper at least or you can smoke him etc. Also do this if your team gets kills. As T you will know where it's most likely to be safe to rotate to and as CT you know where they pushed and that there are probably more T's there (on my level of play, ""B"", ""fast A"", ""fast B"")

* If possible try to stay close enough to your teammates to kill trade. Especially if you happen to outnumber them. If the enemy ends up killing your mate the moment after the kill the enemy will most likely be very exposed

* Grenades are your enemy, buy 2 rounds full grenade set and AK and eco one round or buy 3 AK's and a smoke? Think for yourself what's more beneficial it depends on your grenade usage/efficiency and playstyle. Pro's will be better off the first way I think, most lower-mid players with the second one imo. A nade-set is at least 1000 if you buy 4 grenades (no decoy).

* Flashes: If you toss random flashes

* The exception are smokes. Most of the time you can throw them from a safe spot
Remeber: smokes are used most effectively defensive. If you smoke the hallway you want to rush out of you will probably die since you get seen before you can see out of the smoke.

* In general: Try to play passive. What i mean by that is try not to die in the first 30 seconds (unless rushes called). If you see the timer hit the 1-minute mark think about the situation and start pushing somewhere (as T). If you're not prepared (as CT) and get rushed

* You don't need to buy in the first second. Press Tab and check the money of your mates. if they're poor check if they already bought :p. Even without macro and without shortcuts

* If not everyone has enough money to buy, if you eco once you will have 5 rifles in 2 rounds and you have a real chance to take the rounds. If you all eco you might try some ""cheesy"" stuff like 5 man stacks or 5 man rushes where it won't be expected. This way you end up winning more eco rounds.

* If you win the pistol round and your team buys 4 smg's the second round they're doing it for 2 reasons: smg's (not p90 though) give double the money for a kill. They're good to spray down ecoing pistols with no armor. If you die and the enemy picks up your smg

* In general: Take your time to think before you do anything and check the minimap to keep track of the situation. You need to know what angles are covered and which are not. Also notice the spots your mates are playing and covering and think what you need to cover to get the most of a defensive position and no one will get shot in the back.

* Think before you make calls or you'll bait your teammates. Don't yell ""B B B B B"" if there is only a flash beeing trown. If you see 3 enemies at B

* Learn to explicitly call ""rotate"". A lot of people will call where enemies are and perhaps if they see the bomb

* Think about how your enemies will be rotating before you attack a site and if possible leave somebody to kill them (or at least slow them down). In MM it seems like nobody pays attention to the game while rotating because they're too focused on getting to the site ASAP. Easy kills that can easily turn a round. In general just pay attention to controlling the map (not just the bomb sites).

* Stop telling people how to play when they're in a clutch situation. Just give important info. Don't yell ""HE'S PLANTING A"" if you're not even sure if it's A. Your talking will distract the player and he will want to win the round as well


That's all I can think of right now.

So i guess this is my way to deal with rage and I sincerely hope this helps somebody. I know most of the dumb things get made because yolo and they would know better themselves but consider to try at least as hard as your teammates do

cheers :)

I'm going to stress this out to every single player that refuses to be a part of the strategy. Are there things I'm missing in these?

**Guidelines**

* At the beginning of a round, if everyone else is not buying anything. Don't buy at the first very second of the round. ""I didn't know we had to eco"" is not an excuse.

* Do not buy every round unless everyone in your team can afford a full buy or unless you're forced to buy (e.g last round

* If someone calls for a save round, next round your teammates will have money to buy weapons and you will not.

* Don't buy the most expensive weapon you can afford, I hope I don't have to tell you that a more expensive weapon doesn't necessarily mean it's a better choice for your style of play.

* In higher level teams, light buying or saving for the next round.

* In the save rounds talk to the team and try to be unpredictable. Stack somewhere, etc. Statistics say you'll lose, especially on 1vs1 combat, but every once in awhile, if played correctly, a save round will end in your favor. Know when to save a weapon and most importantly know what the benefits/disadvantages of being alive at the end of the timer are.

* If you can afford it


**Specifics**

* The pistol round is important and it can decide the fate of the next 1-2 rounds. Feel free to buy whatever you see fit for those $800. Armor, defuse kit. Coordinate with your teammates and see who needs to buy what, according to the strategy you're using.

* If you lost the pistol round

* Aim to get a bomb planted in the first two rounds as a T. Even if you lose, in order to afford a full buy.

* If you won the pistol round, you can pick up a high-reward-per-kill SMG ($600), or a Shotgun ($900). Take advantage of the fact that the enemy won't have kevlar &amp; helmet and try to earn as much money as possible.

**Bonus:** I hear a lot of bad advice when trying to save my weapon, or you'll get no money"" (when I'm T), or ""Try and get the kill, you will get no money"" (when I'm CT). Get your facts straight, it's not that hard. The CTs as the defending side, win if the timer runs out. The Ts, as the offensive side will get no money if they run out of time,,1371991678.0,t3_1gwmq7

1373772681.0,1i98ry,Announcement: altPUG is Live!,tasky,128,17,99,"Hey all
 
I know we've talked about it for a while
 
&gt;**What is altPUG?**
 
altPUG is a competitive PUG system alternative to ESEA and Leetway. We provide high quality 128-tick servers with excellent hit registration, Central, West, and Europe; if there's demand we can rapidly scale out to Asia, Australia, and South America.  Servers are created on-demand to make sure that we always have capacity for more players. Our ability to scale to other geographic regions is important because no one likes playing with high ping. Along those lines we won't allow players to join servers if their ping is over 120ms - this means you won't need to deal with players with high pings in your games!
 
altPUG also has automatic team balancing based on skill with a built-in buddy system; this means that if you ""buddy"" people on our service we will keep you and your friends together when balancing teams. However
 
altPUG is in its infancy and we have big plans for where we can take this service. We're looking to empower the CS:GO competitive community to grow from the ground up - this means we need your help.
 
&gt;**What do you want from me?**
 
We want you to use the service and provide feedback! We want direct community involvement and we want to know: What are you looking for in a service? What do you like about altPUG? What gaps are we missing?
 
We're aware fragmentation in the PUG community could lead to a worse experience. With players spread out around four services (Valve Matchmaking, Leetway) the wait times before games start could increase - however, we believe that more options are better for players and we think we can provide a very high quality service (or at the very least force others to improve to compete). So we need the whole community to help make altPUG the best service it can be.
 
&gt;**How much is it?**
 
Right now
 
&gt;**What about leagues and tournaments?**
 
We're having a blast watching all the Reddit teams play and /u/Kubz91, and Team Fixation guys cast this Reddit Cup! Although we don't have league/scrim support currently built into altPUG it's VERY high on our to-do list and we're very interested in supporting the kinds of community run tournaments and cups like the one TNP Gaming has put together!
 
We hope to have more to announce about leagues

OK

If you miss out, as well as at the AMD GamExperience in London on the 25th (in case any of you Redditers are going).

The first website giveaway can be found here: http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/168467/ and will run for a week.

Best of luck to everyone entering.

EDIT 

OK
On a serious note I want to thank you guys for the show of support towards the website and what we're trying to do and we hope that you guys will drop in on us from time to time. We really want to grow the community for this game because that's the only way it's going to have a future. We'll be sure to pimp out this Reddit where and when we can as well and kudos for setting it up. We'll be producing lots of content for you guys to enjoy.
Finally, you would have to like our Facebook page. No-one has to do that if they don't want to but if you are so inclined details of our latest giveaway can be found here:

When CS:GO came out I didn't know what to expect.  I was invited to the beta and thought,"" but after all of the updates this game just keeps getting better and better.  A lot of the randomness factors seem to have been removed and the game is back to a skill-based setting.

I understand and agree that some things need to change to make the game more competitive.  For example

- I don't understand the ""player models are too hard to see

- I feel that hit registration is great in CS:GO.  People just can't seem to grasp that hitboxes are a lot tighter than ever before.  You can't hit the corner of an invisible cube to get a headshot anymore.

- Spraying feels just as skill based/rewarding in CS:GO as 1.6 to me.  You must learn the spray patterns of each individual gun and you will be rewarded for more accurate sprays.

**First of all

 ""WeaponArmorRatio"" is 1.2 while CSS had 1.475.
 This may seem pretty minor to some of you

**Secondly

 This one is pretty obvious, but other similar achievements don't differ that much in numbers)

**Last but not the least is how weak they are on cluttered maps.**

[This is what I'm talking about](http://i.imgur.com/g0zp1YG.jpg).
 It explodes 1 metre away from my face but deals only 6hp due to the tiny wooden chipboard which apparently protected me. I don't say that grenades should damage through metres of concrete (like they did in 1.6) but their penetration has to be increased.

Just to answer a few questions.

Why is this so important?
movement is a BIG part of CS and a major gameplay mechanic, and acceleration has to be just right so that other gameplay mechanics aren't compromised by it, as movement is the central piece on the CS franchise


Why change movement?
Dont get me wrong moving in CSGO feels good, mainly because of how people move, these values will make that less likely to hapen.



How would changing movement benefit the game?

To answer this I'll have to ask another question. 
Why do you love CS? its a personal question, pull 3v1 clutch, hold that angle to gain advantage over the enemy, or manage to kill those 2 guys with a headshot because you used the environment better, or simply because you have better aim and control movement better.

These are the things we love about CS, it wont be 100% perfect but it will be a step in the right direction.

The purpose of this (aside from trying to fix ADAD spamm) is to make a model of movement that makes CSGO a better game to play

This movement initiative started as a fix to ""ADAD"" spamm, it may help but wont fix it completely. It needs to be fixed by increasing tagging or tweaking inaccuracy while moving or both.
What these values do achieve is to make the game feel awesome





How are you planing on adjusting and tweaking?

First we got some control values to compare our values with.
We recorded 1.6's values and GO's values in slow mo then we analysed them frame by frame and wrote down the speed at each frame.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkghPvIh7ZVwdEo3UWhJNTE4WXJfZ0FQYXhFTUdwZ1E#gid=0

(props to majkelDre)

and created the graphics for each curve to have a visual representation of how movement behaves

Considering our control values we made some that were diverse in relation to it

we decided that the best value would be the one that had similar speed to 1.6 but that its curve was similar to GO's so that acceleration would remain proportional to it
After collecting some feedback and testing we came up with these values




sv_friction 4
sv_accelerate 4.7
sv_airaccelerate 16




The next step is going to be setting up a server and testing these.
Then when we gather enough data we'll present these to other community members and ajust as needed so that everyone is happy.

Gamesense:

What is gamesense exactly? Gamesense is your CS meta-game: your ability to see the big picture of whats happening on the map. Gamesense is about consciously keeping track of where enemies could potentially be at all times at allparts of the map, information from teammates, and game knowledge and experience. You use your gamesense to put yourself in advantageous positions whenever possible and to avoid being put in a situation where you are at a disadvantage. Gamesense is about picking when, where and under what terms you fight so that you have a better chance at defeating your 
opponent. 

For example: you're in a 1v1 on dust2. The bomb is planted at A just as you are beginning to walk up the ramp from CT spawn to long A. The terrorist, as more time passes, it would be wise  pop a few glances back at short to make sure he isn't walking that way. As you reach  long you know for a fact that he has to be somewhere at the top of long and the corner betweem short and site. He doesn't know where you are, you know roughly where he is, and you've made your job taking the site and defusing the bomb much easier.

Gamesense is also about making good decisions. This means not getting into long rage fights with your M4 against an AWP. It means sometimes falling back and retreating from a gunfight that's not going your way to re-engage later. It means using your knowledge to flank quickly, the better (unless you're camping spawn and not doing the objective -- that's a different matter entirely).

Choke points:

Like I said earlier, usually separated by choke points. For example, dust2 is initially split as follows: Tunnel in B, double doors at A, and Long A tunnel. You should always use great caution when approaching these points and how you approach them will vary with your spawn (I talk more about this later).

Peeking:

Corners should be peeked progressively -- peeking every common spot from which to watch that corner one at a time (this is when not coordinating a rush, where as all he has to do is pull the trigger -- most of the time you will lose this fight. Additionally, you do not peek corners with your mouse, you peek them with your strafe buttons after already setting your mouse in position for the peek. 

Crosshair management:

You should always keep your crosshair where it is most likely to encounter an enemy and you should keep it aimed at head level. When an enemy appears on your screen,"" and it gets them killed.

Radar:

You really need to be keeping an eye on your radar (a glance every few seconds). You should know that if you're playing long on dust2 and your buddy goes down on short

Spawn location:

Let's say you are CT spawned on dust2 and you're playing 5v5 competitive and are playing bombsite B. If you have a good spawn, you'll find a a few T's in the tunnel already and you're likely going to get toasted. With the worst B spawn, you'll even have issues making it to B platform (the raised area) before a T is peeking it! This means if you have a bad spawn for B, your best bet is probably to play from closet, site boxes, or closet -- it's also probably a good idea to smoke off tunnel entrance to make it harder for T's to pick into site without exposing themselves from multiple angles at once. If you want to get even more nit-picky, when running into B to take your position

Stealth:

You want to unexpected. This means if you're close to where enemies could be and time is a non-issue (plenty of round time, you should be running at full speed to maximize the likelihood that you show up somewhere (like to a bombsite on a rotation) faster than the enemy is expecting you be there.

The unexpected:

We all know that it's advantageous to be near cover. Because of this,  high level players will sometimes sit out of cover to ensure that when the enemy rounds the corner, the enemy have will have to move his crosshair in order to shoot the player – essentially meaning the enemy must score a headshot in order to survive. This is not to take away from the advantage of being close to cover – most of the time on defense you should be in a place where you can retreat easily or have high survivability. This is only one example of the unexpected, but you get the point.

**Map overview ideas 
http://i.imgur.com/ThwUG.jpg:**
It would basically be a second spectating mode. The red and blue dots would actually be the real models that you'd see run around in real time. It's like a more elaborate free cam. So imagine like a Starcraft 2 map, maybe even using your mousewheel to zoom in to a certain player and jump into 1st person, stuff like that. I think if we try to implement spectating features that make SC2 and LoL so successful, we can only improve the game.

Some of the features listed here could also be included in ""normal"" mode (1st and 3rd person)

What happened? CS:S came out. It split up the scene

Looking at CS:GO, sure. But the problem remains the same: **there is no player base**. No playerbase, no sponsors(as these cannot expose their products), thus no money.

My question is then: How do we make CS:GO popular to both the casual player as well as the competitive player?

The gaming market is definitely more competitive than when CS came out in 1999. Back then, Call of Duty, and I don't know how many other titles are out there. Considering this competition, I understand the direction Valve chose; They made a game that simply has too many compromises in terms of gameplay. Now, I do play CSGO competitively, I game about 20 hours a week.. But I feel like I'm playing a crossover between an xbox 360 game and a computer game. The feeling is, at many times

So, do? My answer is: Not much. The CS playerbase seems somewhat constant, if not in a negative value. New players to the FPS genre will choose CoD/battlefield as their casual game, not counter strike. 

Is the title somewhat dead? Whats your take on it?

And 'mericans

**Maps**

The rotation sucks. It's evident that not much care went into developing a quality competitive rotation. Dust2, Inferno, and maybe Vertigo are the only current maps that should be in the rotation. In addition to that, there are a good half dozen well designed maps that need to be added so that people aren't bored playing the same stale maps over and over. The rotation isn't the entire problem, however. Nobody has gotten a good answer as to why the _se versions of the maps aren't being played. These maps are much cleaner and produce much better performance, especially for people with lower end hardware. ESEA is doing this right, which is exactly why you're seeing significantly more people playing on their servers than on the built in servers. It really says something when more people want to pay than to play for free.

**Servers**

I've already mentioned how the new tick rate is a joke, developing a game that gets shitty sales costs even more. It's understandable that you want to give people with lower end hardware and internet connections a chance, but creating a poor play environment is not the answer. The shot reg on the servers is disgustingly bad and I'm one more miserable match away from quitting all together. 


**Positives**

Not everything has gotten worse since the intial launch. While the game never should have been launched without a functional ELO system, things have settled down considerably in terms of quitters and punishment issues.

1366989099.0,1d5och,The future of CS in light of Operation Payback: An ideal roadmap for CS:Go's future,mRWafflesFTW,92,10,45,"Let’s get a few assumptions out of the way first.

* The esports or competitive community draws its player base from the casual community. The casual community and the competitive community need to be playing the exact same game
* Counter-Strike is best played competitively.
* Free to play is in CS’s future. 
* In game match making is CS:Go’s most defining feature
* Valve’s support for DoTA2 through the invitational and constant interaction is incredibly beneficial and CS could use the same love.

We’re seeing a huge resurgence in competitive FPS’s popularity. The recent events put up good numbers on Twitch.TV and a lot of the old guard is coming back to play CS:Go. It feels as though we are primed to burst out into a second golden age. What we need now is Valve’s support.

By hosting Operation Payback, it merely allows people to play maps through the casual match making process. Trying to find a community server hosting your desired custom map which also contains players is virtually impossible. By queuing under a playlist, lesser played map will receive attention by virtue of being grouped with more well known ones. 

The in game competitive match maker helps the competitive community by transitioning casual players into the competitive scene by covering what I think of as the “ESEA gap”. Now, there's no telling which other team is going to join your scrim. You can restrict entry into your scrim based on league, but that's not entirely useful since even if you restrict entry to Open, the lowest league, there's a huge variation in talent within that division. Also, there's a million non-league scrim teams made up of a million different combinations of the old boys club. You can have a scrim team made up of invite players, but because it is a scrim team it technically has no league rank. 

The in-game ranked match making model is critical to promoting growth in both player skill and player base by ensuring relatively even competitive matches. No one would play SC2 if you risked being paired against MarineKingPrime. 

**Valve should host a Valve Experimental-Inaugural Season ticket:** 

* Competitive map list including ESEA maps de_mirage, and 2 new untested competitive maps such as de_seaside
* 128 Tic servers
* 2 flash bangs
* 1:45 second round times

The cost can either be minimal

This will give the community an opportunity to test new maps for competitive play

* Deagle: increased effective range.

* P250: reduced effective range.

* Glock: increased recoil on burst.

* Added a community dedicated server convar ""sv_workshop_allow_other_maps"". When this option is enabled and the server is idling empty

* Added a game setting 'Max Acceptable Matchmaking Ping' to allow users in geographic locations far from official datacenters to find games via matchmaking without using developer's console.

* Servers starting to host a workshop collection will no longer show up as running de_dust.

* Added convar mp_death_drop_c4 that determines whether C4 is droppable.

* Fixed not being able to drop C4 in Demolition mode.

* Added display of public joinable games in maps workshop browser.

* Fixed dead players getting a network update that showed their dead icon position at the position of the player they jumped to spectate right after dying

* Fixed mapcycle problems when the server was playing a map outside of active mapgroup or collection.

* Workshop maps no longer show ""workshop"" prefix on master server and official maps show ""official"" instead of map id when played as part of hosted workshop collection.

* Fixed the post processing effects (like blur) persisting through a level change to the new map if the new map does not contain a postprocess_controller entity.

* Fixed some sv convars so they can be executed via map cfg files

* Fixed the regular radar images not showing on the loading screen for workshop/custom maps

* Fixed an interpolation exploit with bogus update rates.

* Fixed a regression where old protobuf demo files failed to play. All protobuf demos should be playable again.

Now this allows ""legit"" cheaters to stay present in the game. If anything I suggest a screenshot system from valve, and his demos are not sketchy. The only reason ESEA bans anyone is because of their demo system, they do not have a godlike anti-cheat.

I made this to just open the eyes of the CS:GO community. I was tired of seeing ""OMG buy esea it's only solution to playing CS"" as an ongoing topic. Blatant cheaters on CS:GO are being banned just thought I'd let you know :).

The problem is this: in 1.6

Now in CS:GO, but you have to use the shape. This naturally makes the detection much slower. [Screenshot](http://abload.de/img/csgo2012-09-1101-43-196jxz.jpg)

But what if you would render [no fog over the model](http://abload.de/img/overlaymodelonfogwvuog6k1u.jpg) or just a [little bit of fog](http://abload.de/img/overlaymodelonfogn4uok.jpg)?

This would make the player models **much** easier to see than [with fog](http://abload.de/image.php?img=csgo2012-09-1101-42-55njr9.jpg) but **also** easier than by [removing fog](http://abload.de/img/csgo2012-09-1101-43-196jxz.jpg)!

Please

I think this is a much better idea than removing the fog completely.

I currently have a few discussion topics posted for general usage. These include the following:

* [An introduction thread where you can introduce yourself, etc.](http://i.imgur.com/vCkUoxz.png)

* A tips and tricks thread where you can provide feedback to new or inexperienced players.

* A useful tools thread that includes the crosshair generator from the sidebar and a link to useful console commands.

* A videos thread

These are open to all members and have room for expansion.

Additionally

I'm hoping this can be utilized to help the more lone-wolf type players find a group that can communicate and enjoy playing together (as well as cut down on the looking for group posts).

* Stick to one set of settings


* Try to not make any extra moves than necessary - quick switching weapons all the time or ducking is the main thing, but properly.

 
* Learn to maintain a proper crosshair position in places, think of which action takes the most time: swinging your mouse and clicking or just clicking.


* When strafing vs a guy who is also strafing


* **The most important aspect** of the whole game and FPSes in general: **never, you're not going to win more encounters vs a guy who puts a bullet or two straight into your head. In close situations it will end with the aiming guy having low hp, but **alive**.    
As for imperfectly aimed shots - you put yourself into position where you either certainly miss or deal less damage than the opponent: he will fight back
Proper aiming won't come to you fast


* How big of a burst do you shoot and when? It is based on the distance between you and your opponent **and** how much of an opponent is visible.    
*Long range* - like pit to bombsite on dust2 - you should tap (1 bullet). You literally should tap, tapping gives that time-space window where you won't erroneously shoot too early, upping muchly your recoil and defeating the purpose of tapping. If the enemy has only small parts visible (generally hidden behind any kind of boxes and/or ledges) it's also best to tap, even if you are close.    
*Mid range* - two or three burst, best at mid range.    
*Close range* - here things get slightly tricky, that all depends on how your enemies are located based on your position. The more of them close to eachother - the longer  the burst. That touches the topic of how should you approach your enemies, which I will cover next.    
There are exceptions to these rules, but only after you properly tried to aim first.    
* How should you approach your enemies?    
First of all, ct spawn, you at the catwalk, dust2 - you are at a disadvatage, he waits for your appearance, you need to find his exact position. Always try to have the edge, some positions are slightly more favourable than others, you have space for moving; being on the bomsite you either expose your whole body, dark entrance to b bombsite vs closer catwalk (being in the entrance you expose your legs first, you are additionally exposed to t spawn/far catwalk/t spawn middle). Every map has this quirks
Secondly, always try to have 1v1 fights at a time, isolate opponents - a big help in wining 1v2s and bigger.


Tactical aspects.


* Learn to actively use sound to your advantage
* Plant the c4 in proper spots depending on how your team chooses to defend the bombsite
* If you are the one left with c4
* Don't play greedy - back off if you killed one enemy on a spot you will have a hard time defending by yourself
* It's fine to choose more obvious
* As a ct

Valve is an intensely data-driven company. They've said from the beginning that they track every bullet fired in CS:GO, how they're played…everything. They've hired an economist to help them understand the economies they create within their games. 

So I am completely unsurprised, $5 to carry you through the end of July. 

I think this is actually very cool for a number of interesting reasons:

First, flashier maps might entice new players into a game they would not otherwise play, even if it is another $5.

Secondly, the way skins or weapon mods would. 

Thirdly, etc, while at the same time becoming generally familiar to the community. If and when it is time to propose it as a competitive option, it will already have the WD-40 of community familiarity.

- mp_overtime_enable - match will go to overtime if tied in regulation time.

- mp_overtime_maxrounds( default 6 ) - sets number of rounds for overtime

- mp_overtime_startmoney( default 10000 ) - sets starting money for each overtime half.

I know this is a huge reach, but consider this. In the 3~ years since ESEA has become #1, the community has consistently gotten smaller/less competitive, not the other way around. What makes you think them staying the #1 league will all of the sudden create a 180 and revitalize the community? It won't, competitive CS needs a change. 

Look, or influenced the community into becoming stagnant. 

There is this huge misconception that the more money there is at the top end, but people heavily skew how the cycle is supposed to start. An extra 50000 in prize money won't get that 15 year old bf3 player to switch over, it won't even get a mid high level FPS player to switch over. It is literally just that, money for the top end. This effects less than 1 percent of the competitive population. 

CS has to grow first competitively and publicly, CAL etc. will start springing up again gaining in popularity. Leagues that may suffer from lower quality AC (how do you even know how good an AC is?) and what not, but will appeal highly to the younger, newer generation jsut getting into FPS competitively. Things like servers/vent/team sites will start getting out sourced. mIRC will gain momentum again and the community will migrate to new forums. Sites may emerge dedicated solely to news and whatnot (gotfrag) and the community overall will not be completely dependent on one overpriced service that ran a monopoly that little kids could never pay for. and you know what, when the old methods re emerge again, shit's gonna be done RIGHT. because this time we care, this time we don't take it for granted, it may fail miserably, will you quit CS GO if ESEA goes down?

There are so many differences compared to running a 1.6 server which I could still use help on.

1351513177.0,129s5o,Shoutcasters shouldn't miss kills anymore,Charles_K,75,10,21,"[My steam post about shoutcasters and the new GOTV](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2986298)

GOTV reintroduces the ""full map"" display to Counter-Strike spectators once again. As far as I'm concerned, even amateur casters shouldn't be missing nearly as many kills as they have been in the past. Here's why:

*Number Switching*
CS:GO allows you to quickly switch to a SPECIFIC player's point of view by simply pressing that player's corresponding ""number"". Team 1's players are numbered 1-5 while Team 2's players are numbered 6-0. You can actually test this out yourself by joining a 5v5 game (matchmaking

*Full Map Display &amp; Hotkey*
The full map display obviously displays the entire map. This includes the players **and** their **corresponding player numbers**. Plus

* 1. When the round is in freezetime
* 2. When the round starts
* 3. By doing the step above, disorienting viewers and newcomers to the game...). Also, he can easily switch to whichever player he wants to watch *in a single click, thanks to the players having corresponding numbers displayed both in the full map display and in their healthbars* (the 5 bars that show on each side of the spectator cam).

I don't know if this thread was even needed. I haven't seen any recent matches yet

### SPECTATING

- **Resurrected SourceTV as 'GOTV.'**
- Added a map overview that displays players, etc. Can be drawn on in a select-able colored pen when spectating or if the ""sv_competitive_official_5v5"" convar is set to 1 on the server or if the client convar ""mapoverview_allow_client_draw"" is set on the client (drawings are not currently networked to other players).
- Added free camera to spectator modes cycle.
clamped hud_scaling to 0.95.
- Added convar 'cl_spec_show_bindings' that toggles the visibility of the spectator key bindings.
- Added spectator ability to toggle competitive scoreboard player data using the 'drop' command.
- Extended team clan name support to the Team Select Screen. To use team clan name
- After halftime
- Created a server convar that lets you swap the default player side position manually (CTs on right and T's on left) called mp_spec_swapplayersides.
- Made the hotkey that's assigned to jump to a player not change after half-time.
- You can now display a country flag next to your custom team name on the spectator scoreboard by setting ""mp_teamflag_1/2"" to ISO Alpha-2 country code of the country you want to display.
 
### CLASSIC COMPETITIVE 

- Introduced ""Skill Groups""
- Reworked conditions of valid match leaving: A vote to concede becomes available to the team that lost a player. Otherwise the match continues.
- Number of players searching for a competitive match will display number of players compatible with the game type selected by player, and so on.
- Estimated wait time for a competitive match now more accurately displays wait time based on the game type selected by player.

### SERVER ADMINISTRATION

- Added Save/Restore of match state.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file [fileprefix]' -- If set then server will save all played rounds information to files with this prefix. Backup file contains players information like KDA, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades and match score for first and second halves. In a case of a tournament server crash backup file can be loaded using ' mp_backup_restore_load_file'. The default is 'backup'
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_last' -- Every time a backup file is written the value of this convar gets updated to hold the name of the backup file.
    -Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_list_files [number]' -- Lists recent backup round files matching the prefix
   - Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_load_file [filename]' -- Loads the specified backup file and applies players information like KDA, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades; sets the match score for first and second half and starts next round.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_pattern
- Whitelisted 'mp_logdetail' convar.
- Added convar 'sv_damage_print_enable'
- Added 'cl_bobcycle' to 'sv_competitive_minspec'. It's now restricted to the defauklt 0.98 on servers that have 'sv_competitive_minspec' enabled.
- Made all server cash_ convars notify players when they are changed.
- Servers running with sv_pausable 1 will now correctly display 'server paused' UI element on clients when server is paused using 'pause' command.
- Added mp_spectators_max convar to control how many spectators are allowed in a match.
- Added convar mp_halftime_pausetimer that will indefinitely pause the halftime timer.
- Added convar mp_warmup_pausetimer that will pause the warmup period indefinitely. 
 * Warmup periods shorter than 6 seconds cannot be paused.
 
### PERFORMANCE

- Performance improvements for users running on AMD systems.
- Fixed a major performance problem for users running Bitdefender antivirus software.
 
### BUG FIXES

- Fixed two crashes that could happen if you were on a team and went to spectator team.
- Fixed the timer display on the hud still showing even when the bomb was planted.
- Fixed avatar scaling issues on the spectator hud as well as the issues that would place the player slot avatars offset some distance from where they should be.
- Made some adjustments to the specttor UI and regular hud to account for hud_scaling set really high.
Fixed a really bad bug where going from the lobby to a game could prevent players from having input. This would result in not being able to select a team or move around.
- Changed flashbang visual effect in Spectator mode so that it is updated when the target changes.",self,t5_2sqho,False,,rank silver-elite,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/123s6t/counterstrike_global_offensive_update_for_late/

Back in the days i started watching for instance the Surreal series
I started making videos

eSports wise i have worked with a couple of organisations thus far

I have expierenced around 25 events thus far, Intel Saturday Night Games, RaidCall EMS One Spring/Summer Finals, Copenhagen Games 2012 / 2013, DreamHack Summer 2013, Prague Challenge 2013, Gamescom 2011 / 2012 and i did numerous video jobs for companies such as One.de, Nvidia, some of them also got displayed at Gamescom 2012. That is about it a short introduction to what i do and where i found my passion in which is the Counter-Strike franchise to this point.

As Styko did an AMA earlier this week i thought i'd give it a try and see if people are interested

My YouTube channel is located at http://www.youtube.com/Mrtweeday if you would want an insight of what i do with CS:GO in general.

1374773407.0,1j1fpq,KIRE's 24 hour stream for cancer awareness! Information Here &lt;--,ArabianKing,81,15,28,"Hello all

I guess first of all I will introduce myself. My name is Amir ""KIRE"" Khair and I am an invite player for ESEA, streaming my ESEA matches etc. Anyways, for those of who you might know my stream, I have been able to make a decent amount of donations, and in the past I've used them for more hardware and gaming peripherals, as well as give-away things for my stream. This time around though, I am trying to do something a bit nicer and more charitable.

**Since its a reddit post

&gt; About 13 years ago, upgrading my PC along the way with me] was diagnosed with non hodgkin's lymphoma. He has been fighting for 13 years now, and is approaching his final months or so we've been told. My mom went to go see him, and I frankly, felt really bad that I was just sitting at home and playing video games [even though it was at his request I didnt visit him in this condition]. 

&gt; So sitting and thinking while I was in a death match. I decided I would stream a ton over the next month, called Fuck Cancer. The website is www.letsfcancer.com - Anywho basically my goal is to raise 500.00 over the next month. I will also be matching the donation amount I recieve up to 500.00. So in reality, my goal is to raise 500.00 via you, the stream viewers, and then match it with some money I've put aside and donate 1000.00 to the Fuck Cancer Charity. I realize that not all of you are in positions to donate, but I still wanted to have a 24 hour stream, and post here so that I can reach a big viewer base :D


So where I am left is with my 1st of 3, Death Match, Match Making with friends, Match Making with viewers, I'll do a few give-aways of free games or gaming hardware like mice and mousepads - and just interacting with the chat as much as possible.

* All donations will go towards Cancer research and the total

* I will be playing games with viewers, and I will try to have some north american invite players come in and answer some questions and play with viewers as guests [ some members from curse, as well as some other players]

You should read these if you want to improve your play or game sense


**Get a working microphone, and this has a few subpoints of it own.

* Don't use your native language
* Don't shout
* Make calls
* Don't be a backseat player. If you died and you're spectating someone else
* In clutch situations


**Work together as a team** 

* Learn what and when to buy. I've already covered this in a past [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1gwmq7/people_really_need_to_learn_when_and_what_to_buy/)
* When attacking
* When defending
* Don't switch map positions when defending before telling anyone. By default
* The 5v5 Competitive usually is played with 1 AWPer the most. Make sure you announce your intention of buying the AWP and the position you want to play with it. Buying two AWPs in a round is as uncommon as it is impractical.
* Everything goes as long as it's agreed upon and everyone commits to it. If you want to rush them in close-quarters with shotguns
* Decide with your alive teammate(s) when to save your weapons and when to attempt a re-take. 
* When splitting up and going for picks

LE: Baiting is the process of falling intentionally behind while your teammate takes the lead. This way


**Know the game

* Unless decided otherwise, not rush the Ts in their spawn zone. The T's are expected to attack the bombsites, not camp until the time runs out, etc.
* Always watch the timer and act accordingly. If the bomb is down and there are just a couple seconds left on the clock, don't risk getting picked and lose the round.
* Judge based on your teammates calls which areas of the map are safe and which are potential threats. Know what corners to peak.
* Learn the maps, the boost spots, the angles you can peek or get peeked from.


**Personal training and development**

* If you play with people you like, team-oriented people has a good positive impact on the result of the game, as opposed to playing with rogue/aggressive players nobody likes.
* Practice as much as possible. Practice your aim and train your muscle memory. There are many dedicated subjects on the matter

1372025134.0,1gxj12,My simple guide that will make you a successful terrorist.,ViZion94,75,13,43,"My guide on being a successful terrorist. 

**Terrorists when taking a bombsite**

 * Your objective is to either kill all the counter terrorists or to get the bomb down and run down the timer. The latter is the choice you should aim for.
 * The person with the bomb should never enter a site first because if the guys behind you get stuck or someone in the pack stops and the rest of you are blind the person in front will be dead while everyone else falls back. Simple stuff.
 * **Flashes** and **Smokes** should be used efficiently.
 * **Flashes** are for one of two things: Faking a site, some won't. If they are blind, it is an easy kill for you, IF they aren't blind, they had to turn from the flash which also means they have to turn again to re-adjust their aim. This is when you kill them because some people aren't very good at readjusting their aim as quickly.
 * **Smokes** The concept seems simple enough but people misuse smokes even though smokes are the most useful things you can buy for $300. Use smokes to block off a point of view so you only have to fight one CT rather than 2 or 3. **For Example:** When taking B site at de_dust2
 * **Smoke choke point entrances** For example places like B double doors. This is because no CT wants to run through a smoke which causes them to delay their retake.
 * Aim to check all common spots before planting the bomb and get the bomb down as soon as possible before CT's start rotating.

**Once the bomb is Down**

 * Once the bomb is down **HIDE SOMEWHERE AND DON'T YOU DARE PEEK**
I say this because if you are peeking you can get picked off one by one by an awper who is waiting for someone to peek them and all of a sudden an easy 3 vs 2 has become a not so easy 2 vs 2.
 * **Re-smoke the spots that the smoke has expired.**
 * **Counter flash whenever the CTs flash to try and re-take the bombsite**
 * **Trade Kills** Work a crossfire or set up some angles where the counter terrorist can't aim easily after the first kill
**For Example:** Terrorists get bomb down at A plat on de_dust2
 * **WORK THE BOMB TIMER** If you are hidden the CTs have to take their time to re-take a site so if you are hidden

Edit: I have read the criticism and I do agree with many of you that peeking is definitely situational. I didn't really think too deeply on the subject as I didn't really want to go too in-depth because the guide would have ended up being way too long. I will try to add onto the guide below me by addressing some of the more key points that I have missed! Also thank you for all those that have contributed in any sort of way (if I use one of your tips to add onto this guide I mean you).

My advice is that you can also always use the element of surprise to your advantage.
Quick peeking or also known as shoulder peeking (You peek for a split second and hide for map control and location of CTs) is good for slowing down the enemy which is beneficial depending on the numbers alive on your team and the CTs.

**Important thing about smokes that everyone should know**

 *  Never run through one because the people on the other side can see you coming through the smoke before you can see anything by a big margin.

**Other things to take note**

 * A ""simple rush case"" is not always the go to strat because there are many smokes that can be thrown before entering a site that can give a big advantage and some good pop flashes that can be utilized to give you a big advantage. **For Example:** On de_nuke for taking upper

 * Use your spawn especially as a Terrorist to your advantage. A good spawn where a majority of your team is at the closest possible position to a bombsite is very beneficial because you will be able to get a possible peek position quicker than a CT. My favourite example of this as an awper is if you have the hill spawn on Terrorist side closest possible to Long. You are able to reach the peek spot at long double doors to the long corner before a CT can where if you have quick enough reflexes you will be able to get the CT almost any round the decide to push up.

Arguably

* 128 tick servers
* Admins (whether for manual bans or otherwise)
* ""Industry leading"" anti-cheat client and updates
* Leagues and tournaments (tournaments with cash prizes)

In terms of market targets

* Tournament rules settings (2 flashes
* Tournament non-official maps (if someone knows

**Valve**

What Valve have to do at the moment (which you paid $7-$15 depending on whether you bought it on sale or not):

* Develop and balance the game (development costs)
* Run literally thousands of official servers (64 tick)
* Limited admin-ing of servers: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21916548/Ban1.png

For Valve's target market

* 1 flash/player in competitive
* Increased round timers
* Fog on official maps (although mirage has similar fog settings to official maps
* Slower implementation of competitive maps to the map pool (although mirage and other maps are incoming)

&gt; Adding new maps to compMM would be good

https://twitter.com/matttwood/

&gt; We're going to make Mirage an official map

**What players (most of us) want**

Players want as much as they can, but offers a sub-optimal experience to the competitive player, although arguably an accessible experience for the new player.

You see a LOT of threads and posts saying the same thing. What it seems to boil down to, for free. Or some part of what ESEA does.

So basically, and not with time like a subscription would. Looking at it this way, the question of why doesn't Valve offer everything ESEA offers, is the same as why isn't ESEA free? Economic realities and market segmentation. Which is fine, we get choice, and there are probably countless other parties offering these services in a fluid market, you might just have to pay for what it you are willing to pay,,False,t3_1d8vpk

The good:

- Headshots are harder to land compared to CSS at least
- Weapons are overall more balanced
- The game is damn solid
- Classic CS gameplay is still there
- The remake of the maps is beautifully done
- The new weapons are a great adiction

The bad:

- Spray and pray seems more viable than ever before outside long ranges. Most weapons can still empty their magazines at medium ranges and still hit enough bullets to kill someone as long as you're not going full-blown retard and do it while on the move and jumping.
- As a side effect of the increased eye candy
- By the above, all the time. Might just be my bad luck so far, but I've always hated AWP restrictions and right now I feel they're a must because for whatever reason, everyone just seems to be taking the easy way in the game and camp their hearts out with their instagib while the attacking team is pretty much required to be Neo in order to survive.

These are the only major gripes I have with the game, as to the bad ones that people playing simply seem dumber and are getting away with it. The thing in beeing able to distinguish models kind of comes with the turf since we can't keep 1.6/Source graphics forever, but the artwork could have been done in a different way to make the game more forgiving in something that is unrelated to player skill.

However, this is the 4th versionf of CS I'm going through and the first one to leave me completely divided in a bit of a love-hate relationship. Overall gameplay feels solid but gun gameplay seems random and a lot more forgiving, like we went from 'who can zero in on the enemy's head best' to 'who can empty the gun faster'.",,False,self,t5_2sqho,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/yh3nv/my_thoughts_on_csgo_from_a_player_of_10_years/

* Added ability to rename demos
* Added ability to smart rename demos
* Added a menu bar at the top
* Added a few more settings
* Able to open your demo/cfg folder from the menu
* Can now use a custom CS:GO directory
* When you right click a demo

COMING:

* Hopefully full parsing of the demo file to get the players
* Full release of the source
* Proper design of the application
* Automatic demo recording (I'm still undecided on how I want to do this so it might not make it to release)

It allows you to view and sort all of your demo files without having to faff about in the CS:GO directory or ingame console. Allows you to launch and play the demo from within the application.

Any inputs you change in the settings (res

---

## Usage
In order to use this you MUST set the steam directory (and for custom game directory the Counter-Strike:Global Offensive directory). I've used the ""default"" location but if you have a custom directory you WILL need to set it! Once you've set the directory the list will populate with demos in your CS:GO folder. Double click a demo to have it launch &amp; play.

---

## Smart Renamer

This automatically renames your file based on a set of elements entered in the settings panel (Default: Ty-M-Ti-Tk) using the default the filename would be (eg.) GOTV-de_dust2_se-46mins-128tick.dem

* Ty - Type (GOTV or POV)
* M - Map
* Ti - Time (Xmins)
* Tk - Tickrate (Xtick)

If you don't want one of these elements in the filename just remove it

The seperator in the settings will be what character is used to seperate each element in the filename when it gets renamed!

* TNP Gaming would like to present you with our new and REVOLUTIONARY way to play Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Over the last few years, but also a huge batch of unknown players that can make themselves known to the masses. 
 
 
* What separates us from other Counter-Strike tournaments is that we are run like a Sports League. What this means in we never cease operation and run yearly. We have 4 seasons a year split between off-seasons where we take new registrations. New sign ups are placed into the rookie draft and scouted during our Scouting Combine Weekend while Veterans (returning players) are place in a bidding war. Teams have a salary cap and a set amount of contract years they can hand out. Whichever team bids the highest earns the player and based on their salary they can be given X amount of years. This is where our RPG kicks in. How you play determines your career. Play well and you could be the hottest commodity in the league and headline all-star weekend. Player poorly and be a bad teammate and you could be released into the Free Agency Pool. Play inconsistently and you could find yourself being traded to another team. Owners in our league have full control of their teams. From trading players to releasing

1376272960.0,1k6hfu,Help FaceIT help us.,NiPTV-Anders,64,8,23,"Hello everyone !  

I feel like every other day I discover a new topic I wish I could do something about when it comes to Counter-Strike, to cast CS at the FaceIT studio, so here is what I have discovered on my returning trips.  

1) The FaceIT guys are some hard working people.  
2) They are passionate about the game and wish to improve their platform based on feedback from the community.  
3) They actually give back to the community
4) They are the only other studio in Europe
5) They are very skilled and talented
6) They will fly in casters and colour casters(Threat and myself last month)  

Now there is no hiding that FaceIT is a business, but then in turn provide more content for the game, and hopefully continue that happy spiral.  

I had a long and rather depressing talk with the owner of the studio last night where he said that he had spent about 1 hour a week for a while now trying to talk to users who had signed up for the CS platform. It isnt even his job to do this

Me: So I heard you how single handedly resurrected the Quake community?  
Him: Its true, and slowly managed to give them the things they wanted. So we slowly converted all the negative people and came out as the heroes, that made me feel so good.  

---- Pause to talk about quake ect... ----  

Him: Actually that is what makes me sad about our involvement with Counter-Strike


Obviously the above is just how I recall the conversation, so dont take it too literally, but I hope the message comes across. I think it was after this that it occured to me that FaceIT could really do a lot for the community. I also just need to add that, in case it sounds like that reading it, this wasnt some kind of whiny speach about the CS community being shit as we hear fairly often, this was the actual frustration of a person who really puts a lot of heart into trying to build something.  

They offer 128 tick servers. They are VERY receptive towards feedback from the community. You can actually use the time you spent to win things from their sponsors.  

I can´t think of many reasons not to play on their platform, give them feedback and I doubt very seriously that you will be dissapointed in the long run.

My issue is that a few weeks/months ago I had no problem with CS:GO. I had stable FPS between 200-300 but now it's amazingly random. It usually won't go higher than 300 (yes fps_max is set to 300 and I didn't change my settings) and it usually drops between 80 or even 60. It is extremely annoying looking at how it shouldn't happen with my PC.

In what is easily going to be the most awesome CS filled night this month has given us, not 3, but 5 matches that are going to be ""freaking awesome"".

Starting up live at 6pm GMT, and VG hoping to take first place in the league, this is going to be one hell of a match.

ESC vs Anexis Following this up at 7pm GMT, are in a tough spot being knocked down to 4th place by Virtus.Pro, and need this win. On the other hand, Anexis need a victory to say in the invite league, and who better to get against then a head as big as ESC's? But that will follow onto:

NIP VS VG! 8pm GMT HELL YEA!!!!!!!!!! The mother of all matches

Virtus.pro vs ASES: 9pm GMT.

ASES are in trouble and need a win, aren't going to make it easy. Is this going to be a dominating display by the Virtus pro side, or is ASES going to be able to make the upset of the century?

10pm-12PM??? GMT Of course, and I'll be demo casting the following:

AL vs Fnatic. Fnatic started the season badly, they have to defeat Absolute legends. 

Fm.Toxic vs Anexis. After a brilliant start to their season, who have only managed to pick up one win so far.

Who is developing the game now? Are they actively making the game better? I ask because I mostly here about how bad the game is (long queue times, etc.)

I really like that GO has matchmaking because I mostly enjoy 5v5's and getting one in 1.6/Source was pretty much impossible without ESEA. Is the matchmaking a good replacement for someone who really enjoys competitive 5v5's?

To better gauge the skill of individual players

-------

Hey there!

Myself and my friend (*Poit*) have full intention of picking up Reddit Cup. Dates to come shortly as we don't want to conflict with ESEA LAN playoffs. We are in the process of creating the application form which should be online soon as well as general tournament rules and information, and let all of you know that we will be taking this over.

We'll be posting updates regularly to this subreddit. Check back for recurring updates

We're also going to kickstart the prize pool with **$200** out of pocket. In the coming week we'll have a web page where you can directly toss money into the prize pool and keep us accountable. We figure having a tournament with no prize is like playing poker without betting real money. No money will be taken off the top

We hope to make this the best Reddit Cup so far

&gt;tomorrow we plan to launch the CS:GO Maps Workshop.
 
&gt;1. We’ve started working on the wiki here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO_Workshop_For_Server_Operators

&gt;It would be helpful if people read through it and posted questions and helped us cover the basics by tomorrow.


&gt;2. We’re moving the _SE maps from the depot into the workshop. You can either squirrel them away before they get deleted or use them directly from the workshop

&gt;In order to do that you will need to

&gt;a. Learn how to launch your server with a workshop collection instead of a mapgroup.

&gt;b. Learn how to create collections so you can recreate your mapgroup and get your server up and running asap.

 
&gt;What is a Collection? A collection is essentially a mapgroup ( or mapcycle ) of Workshop maps that is editable and sharable through the Maps Workshop.

Probably the most drastic change so far is to address a major problem we've seen: people come to the site, and then never play a game.  We implemented some tracking to see how many people download the client (about 60% of the 565 registered users) and how many have logged into the client (less than that).  To help address this, we launched a [Getting Started guide](http://i.imgur.com/uHtxXNZ.png). You should only see this once when you log in or create an account; to get back to it, click ""Support"" and select ""Getting Started"".

*We still need your feedback!* We're quickly squashing bugs as soon as we can and the list is dwindling, tell us:

1. What do you like about the service?
2. What would you change if you could?
3. How can we make altPUG more awesome?

If you haven't signed up, enjoy the change log from the past 4 days: 

**Website:**

* ADD: Advanced formatting added to the forums
* ADD: Added a new registration workflow to make it easier to get started with altPUG
* ADD: Added the ability for users to find Steam Friends already on altPUG
* ADD: Added a buddy list to the portal
* ADD: In player lists
* ADD: Leaderboard now highlights the currently logged in user
* CHG: Updated the look of tooltips and added tooltip support to the in-game browser
* CHG: Removed the Oregon west coast server location as it was redundant
* FIX: User display names now must be unique
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the player would be incorrectly credited for a win/loss based only on the player's performance
* FIX: Fixed an issue with the central server where the system clock would fall out of sync
* FIX: Fixed an issue where using some characters in forum posts caused a 500 error

**Server Add-on:**

* ADD: Server logs are now uploaded automatically when the server crashes
* ADD: Added a ready* up kick timer to halftime
* ADD: Added a ready* up kick timer to players already connected when the match ends
* ADD: Added a new version of the .players command while the match is live (splitting the players by team)
* ADD: Added support for demo uploading and processing
* ADD: Turned all talk on during warm-up and half time
* CHG: The host name of the game server now reflects the name on the website
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the server would not switch maps after a map vote if Valve returns an HTTP error from the workshop
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the server would crash if a player was still connecting when a round ended
* FIX: Fixed an issue where the server could crash on map change
* FIX: Improved server performance while demos were uploading to the CDN

**Client:**

* ADD: Added a ""Play Now"" button that launches the server browser
* FIX: Fixed Windows 8 compatibility issues with login process
* FIX: Lowered the rate at which the client verifies the user's login token
* FIX: Fixed an issue where the client could not login using Firefox or Opera
* FIX: Fixed an issue where applying a client update would not gracefully close the currently executing client application
* FIX: Fixed an issue where applying a client update would fail if SteamService had an open file handle on the client

DOTA is the popular Warcraft 3 mod that everyone should be familiar with due to the recent success of the proper games made that are modeled after it. DOTA and DOTA2 are incredibly similar to each other

There are two major points that I would like to make from this information.

1) The International is a yearly DOTA2 mega-tournament held by Valve themselves

2) DOTA and DOTA2 play very similarly. Movement, etc. are all the same. The only differences are improved visuals, interface, and some buggy interactions fixed. Why, then, is every version of Counter Strike so fundamentally different from each other? Why is it when we complain about design flaws in CS:GO we are told they are intended and to adapt? How can these two conflicting mindsets exist under the same roof?

----

Of course the obvious answer to the question of why DOTA2 gets so much more attention than CS is money

1373768322.0,1i93yt,Over 1 million CS:GO monthly players,LashLash,64,11,5,"I don't know if everyone noticed this

""... but are 18 points in the top comment of a Reddit post enough to represent **over a million CSGO monthly players**?""

So you might be wondering how this make sense with ~30k peak concurrent players according to steam: http://www.steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;appid=730

First I will define a player day. A player day is the number of days of a game was played by all players. If there was only 1 player in a game, that's 5 player days of game time. To figure out player days, you find the area under a concurrent user graph, where the horizontal axis is in units of days, and the vertical axis is units of concurrent players.

Back to what this has to do with anything. According to the steam graph,000 average * 7 days, you want the area under the graph for player days). 

So over the past month, if there over million CS:GO monthly players, then the average CS:GO player played a bit less than 600,000/1,000,000 days, or slightly less than **14.4 hours in the last month for the average player (CS:GO)**.

Compare this to DotA 2. ~3.9 million monthly players ([Source](http://blog.dota2.com/)) while the peak is above 300k concurrent. Approximately 1,000 x 7 days, again you want to estimate the area under the graph). So approximately 7,200,000 player days in the last month. The average DotA 2 player in the past month played about 7,200,000/3,000 days or **44 hours on average in the last month for the average player (DotA 2)**.

DotA 2 is a more played game by it's populace based on hours, while DotA 2 requires you to commit if you play. The majority of CS:GO players (and CS players in general) don't play 5v5 pugs.

What if CS:GO is free to play for all game mode except ""Match Making""

I think if Valve wants to make CS:GO this structure

Thoughts?
