No. This is the playoffs. 

Save your goodwill towards men for either a) Christmas or b) the regular season. They are not our friends. We hate them until the series ends (and then maybe a little afterwards). Don't apologize to those Rag fans for our fellow Caps fans slamming the glass or complaining about the refs. 

Fuck the Rangers. Fuck their ""real"" fans. Fuck their shit ass stadium. Fuck them. See the hatred in the OTT-MTL series? It's good. Embrace it. It's the playoffs

Sorry for bitching.

TL;DR: Fuck Rangers fans. Don't be ashamed of other Caps fans. Go Caps. Unleash the Fury.",self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/1dx1af/so_can_we_cut_this_stuff_out/

&gt; After the teams' game at the end of February, four points out of eighth. Each has 14 games remaining.

&gt;""It's kind of like a long extended playoff series here

&gt;""It's not even teams we're trying to catch. We're all battling amongst each other and it makes it tough because that means teams are getting points every night that we're trying to jockey with for position in the standings.""

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; A win would put Washington at .500 for the first time this season. The Capitals got their fourth road win in a row by scoring with 40 seconds left in the third period before defeating the Buffalo Sabres 4-3 in a shootout.

&gt;""This is a huge trip for us, and these points are huge for us.""

&gt;Green scored the tying goal and had his first multipoint game since Jan. 25

&gt;""That's what the leaders on your team do, he wants [the puck]. He wants to be the guy, and that's a great characteristic to have as one of the leaders on your team.""

&gt;Game time is 6 p.m. after Saturday's 7 p.m. start with the Flyers having played at home Saturday at 1 p.m.

""Philly gets a little bit more rest than us, we needed the points, we got 'em; hopefully that gives you some confidence and we can turn it into a good start tomorrow,"" coach Adam Oates said.

**[Flyers](/r/flyers):**

&gt; Despite never winning more than two games in a row

&gt;""It's been kind of a tough season for us, and I think with the remaining games, we just keep playing like that, and who knows?"" forward Matt Read said.

&gt;""We've just got to keep winning and try and make a playoff run

&gt;The Flyers added defenseman Kent Huskins in a trade with the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday

&gt;""When a young player comes in you want to watch and see how he's doing in his first game,"" Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""He did a good job defensively and that's a tough line to play against (Saturday).""


### Players To Watch:

&gt;Ovechkin, 24.8 percent). Forward Zac Rinaldo was credited with 12 hits in 12:41 of ice time on Saturday. ""Give me 18, I'll give you 20,"" he said.

### Big story:

&gt;   This is a true rivalry now -- the Capitals and Rangers will be meeting in the postseason for the fourth time in the past five years. The Rangers won in seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals last season. Washington needed five games to eliminate New York in the 2011 conference quarterfinals. The Capitals came back from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Rangers in seven games in the 2009 conference quarterfinals.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;As hot as the Rangers were in April

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had 20 goals and 32 points in the last 19 games of the regular season. Nicklas Backstrom had 24 points over the same span, against the Rangers.

&gt;Washington is dealing with an injury situation as well. Joel Ward (bruised left knee) has been out since April 7. He is back at practice but has not been skating on any of the top four lines. However

&gt;Brooks Laich (sports hernia surgery) is out and likely won't be back for this series.

**[Rangers](/r/newyorkrangers):**

&gt; New York went 10-3-1 in April to clinch a playoff berth. The Rangers' offense came around as they scored 51 goals (3.64 per game)

&gt; Derek Stepan and Henrik Lundqvist are two of the biggest reasons the Rangers made the playoffs.

&gt; Stepan finished April with 19 points in 14 games to earn the NHL's Third Star of the Month. It was the most productive month in his three-season career

&gt; Lundqvist started and finished all 14 games in April and posted a .934 save percentage and 1.76 goals-against average. It was his best month since January 2012.

&gt; The Rangers

&gt; ""Injuries are part of it, so that's how we go about it. There's no sense in worrying about it, it's just finding people to make big plays in those situations and get big minutes in those situations to help your team win.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Stepan has been leading the Rangers, but Backstrom has produced, and Mike Green has 19 points in the past 19 games, including seven in the past four.

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back)

### Big story:

&gt;   The Capitals can clinch the Southeast Division and the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference if they defeat the Jets in regulation or overtime. On the flip side, but could also end their hopes of making the top eight in the East playoff race.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;  The Capitals no longer need any help from anyone. After a 2-8-1 start that dropped them to the bottom of the division

&gt; A win in regulation or overtime will give them the division title and the third seed in the East. A regulation loss would mean Washington would likely need to win its last two games to move past the Jets.

&gt; ""There's still three games in the season, you're in. But you need to take that like, 'OK, it's not the end of the world,' either.""

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; Winnipeg's final road trip of the regular season got off to a successful start when the Jets edged the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 on Monday night. Antti Miettinen's goal with 7:36 left in regulation broke a 1-1 tie. Aaron Gagnon also scored for the Jets

&gt; But make no mistake - the Jets know what's at stake when they take the ice Tuesday night.

&gt; ""I think it's been circled on our calendar for a long time now

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Ladd was the NHL's First Star of the Week. He has 10 points in his past five games. Goaltender Ondrej Pavelec is 6-0-1 in his past seven games. … Alex Ovechkin has fueled Washington's surge. He leads the NHL in goals with 30

### Big story:

&gt;  The New York Rangers found their offense on Monday by gaining possession and going hard to the net. After scoring one goal in the first two games, in Game 3 to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-7 series. The difference was again special teams, but it flipped on Washington. The Capitals had been strong on the power play and dominant on the penalty kill, but the Rangers were much better on the power play and were perfect on the PK in Game 3. Marc Staal returned to the Rangers' lineup after missing 29 games with an eye injury.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Coach Adam Oates gave his team Tuesday off, up-and-down Game 3. They were originally scheduled to practice at Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., but Oates nixed that after the game Monday.

&gt;""At this time of the year,"" Oates said. ""So we'll take [Tuesday] off and recharge the battery.""

&gt;The Capitals had a chance to at least force overtime in Game 3 when they went on the power play with 1:54 left in the third period. They turned it into a 6-on-4 when Braden Holtby was pulled for the extra skater (Joel Ward) with roughly 90 seconds left. However

&gt;Washington's power play was 0-for-3 in Game 3 after going 2-for-7 over the first two games in the series.

&gt;""They did a good job of getting in the lanes

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; They got goals from four different players in Game 3 (Brian Boyle

&gt;Asham and Stepan scored in the third period because Ryan McDonagh and John Moore

&gt;""That was a huge difference in the outcome of the game, wait to see what they are going to do. We want to try to make a difference. Their defensemen have been getting involved in their offense, and we need to do our part offensively on our back end.""

&gt;It goes unnoticed at times, but Lundqvist made several point-blank saves while the Capitals were pushing and owning time of possession during 5-on-5 play.

&gt;""You always feel a little bit better after a win

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Brassard chipped in with a goal and two assists in Game 3. Boyle was effective not only with his physicality

Jan 27 '13|[](/r/caps) 3-2 |



### Big story:

&gt; These teams are level at 31 points

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington did everything it needed to by winning the final three games of its most recent road trip to squirm back into the Stanley Cup Playoff race. The schedule also set up perfectly for a postseason push: The Capitals play seven straight games against clubs outside the top eight in the East.

&gt;Well

&gt;This is the first of three road games in four nights, who will be an unrestricted free agent in July.

**[Sabres](/r/sabres):**

&gt; Lindy Ruff was fired after a 6-10-1 start, and those extra non-regulation losses are the reason Buffalo still has scant postseason aspirations.

&gt;Buffalo's schedule isn't nearly as favorable as Washington's in the coming days. After this contest, but the Sabres are going to need to knock off teams well ahead of them in the standings to not be out of the playoff race in two weeks.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin has seven goals and 12 points in the past eight games. … Sabres forward Tyler Ennis has two goals and five points in his past five contests.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** John Erskine (upper body), Eric Fehr (undisclosed)
* **Sabres:**  Alexander Sulzer (knee)

### Big story:

&gt;  The series shifts to Madison Square Garden with the Capitals leading 2-0 after Mike Green hammered in a 55-foot one-timer for the overtime winner Saturday in Game 2 at Verizon Center. The Capitals have limited the Rangers to one goal

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Coach Adam Oates gave his team a partial off-day Sunday

&gt;""It's nice whenever you have an optional, get a stretch in or if you need to get out there and get a little skate in, it's good. It's good for the guy. Everyone, just individually, does what they need to do to be ready for [Monday].""

&gt;Everyone already knew the Capitals’ power play could be dangerous. It was first in the NHL at 26.3 percent during the regular season. But Washington has put on a penalty-killing clinic over the first two games after finishing the regular season 27th in the League on the PK.

&gt;The Capitals have been aggressive on the puck and have forced the Rangers into poor decisions resulting in either clears or shorthanded chances the other way.

&gt;The PK actually became a strength late in the season

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; After scoring 51 goals over 14 games in April, without a shot on goal.

&gt;""I don't think we should overthink this, getting in on our forecheck. That's when we're at our best and creating offense.""

&gt;The Rangers' biggest problem in the series has been on the power play. They are 0-for-7 with 10 shots on goal. The Capitals have also blocked 13 shots when the Rangers have been on the power play.

&gt;""We definitely gotta get more shots on our power play, I think we'll be fine.""

&gt;Clowe said he isn't ruling out a return in Game 3. He has missed the past three games dating back to the end of the regular season with an undisclosed injury.

&gt;Staal, but his status likely remains the same. He said earlier in the series that he has to feel comfortable that he can play his normal game despite some blurred vision out of his injured eye before he returns.

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Capitals goalie Braden Holtby has a .983 save percentage and 0.47 goals-against average through the first two games. Holtby has allowed one goal on 60 shots. Alex Ovechkin and Green each have a goal and an assist in the series.

### Big story:

&gt;   After falling behind in the first period the Washington Capitals rallied for three straight goals against the sputtering Rangers.  The Rangers made a surge in the third but with a miraculous save Holtby kept the two goal lead in place to finish the game 3-1 for the Capitals.  With the second game in tow the Rangers look to even the series and take home ice advantage.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;As hot as the Rangers were in April

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had 20 goals and 32 points in the last 19 games of the regular season. Nicklas Backstrom had 24 points over the same span, against the Rangers.

&gt;Washington is dealing with an injury situation as well. Joel Ward (bruised left knee) has been out since April 7. He is back at practice but has not been skating on any of the top four lines. However

&gt;Brooks Laich (sports hernia surgery) is out and likely won't be back for this series.

**[Rangers](/r/newyorkrangers):**

&gt; New York went 10-3-1 in April to clinch a playoff berth. The Rangers' offense came around as they scored 51 goals (3.64 per game)

&gt; Derek Stepan and Henrik Lundqvist are two of the biggest reasons the Rangers made the playoffs.

&gt; Stepan finished April with 19 points in 14 games to earn the NHL's Third Star of the Month. It was the most productive month in his three-season career

&gt; Lundqvist started and finished all 14 games in April and posted a .934 save percentage and 1.76 goals-against average. It was his best month since January 2012.

&gt; The Rangers

&gt; ""Injuries are part of it, so that's how we go about it. There's no sense in worrying about it, it's just finding people to make big plays in those situations and get big minutes in those situations to help your team win.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Stepan has been leading the Rangers, but Backstrom has produced, and Mike Green has 19 points in the past 19 games, including seven in the past four. (And don't forget to watch out for Matty P's celebrations).

### Big story:

&gt; With the possibility seeming more realistic each day that it will take winning the Southeast for one of these teams to make the Stanley Cup Playoffs

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; There are still 13 games remaining to be played for Washington to overcome its rough start, the tying score to Kimmo Timonen with 9.5 seconds remaining and the winner by Ruslan Fedotenko 1:34 into overtime to suffer a 5-4 defeat.

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt; Veteran goalie Dan Ellis was activated from injured reserve Monday and would seem likely to get the start despite Peters' unblemished performance in his prior outing against Washington. Things haven't gone as well for Peters since he had to come on in the final minute of a March 21 game against New Jersey when Ellis suffered a laceration to his leg. He's lost three of four starts


### Players To Watch:

&gt; Ovechkin has eight goals and four assists during an eight-game points streak for the Capitals. Nicklas Backstrom has three goals and four assists in the past six games. Mike Green has goals in consecutive games. Troy Brouwer has a goal and three assists during a three-game points streak.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:**  Tom Poti (back)
* **Hurricanes:**    Tuomo Ruutu(groin), Cam Ward (knee)

### Big story:

&gt;  The rivalry resumes between these Southeast Division rivals Sunday night at Verizon Center

&gt;Tampa Bay, however, have two games in hand on the Islanders.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington possesses the best power play in the NHL. The Florida Panthers found that out the hard way Saturday.

&gt;Alex Ovechkin continued his torrid scoring pace with a hat trick and the Caps scored three times via the man advantage

&gt;In the end

&gt;“We play our way, especially with the kind of opportunities we had on the power play.”

**[Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning):**

&gt; Tampa Bay rallied erased a one-goal deficit twice Saturday

&gt;""We didn't do a good job of puck management


### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Green has five goals in Washington's past four games and now leads the League in even-strength goals by a defenseman with seven despite missing 13 games because of injury. … Tampa Bay's Shawn Matthias also has five goals in his past four games and has four more in 39 games (14) than he's had in any of his previous four NHL seasons with at least 50 games played.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about why and the bottom line is that I just can't complain about any part of the way the Caps have been playing. They have finally evolved to do all the little things we as Caps fans knew they had to do to win in the post-season. And they're not only doing it

To a man

Hunter has put every guy in a position to succeed. From Alzner and Carlson bottling up the Rangers 5 on 5, to Hendricks flying all over the ice, to Aucoin being a self-described 'prick' every chance he gets, to Ovie being below the circle and actually gaining speed on the breakout, and to Joel Ward starting and closing out game 6 after what should have been the nail in the coffin. 

In a sport filled with so many passionate

### Big story:

&gt;  The home team is perfect in the series after the Washington Capitals' 2-1 overtime win in Game 5 Friday at Verizon Center. For the series to go back to Washington for Game 7 Monday

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Washington has been excellent at home in this series

&gt;The difference, mistakes they haven't been making at Verizon Center.

&gt;""We talk about the little decisions that shoot ourselves in the foot

&gt;One way for the Capitals to have a better start at MSG is to stay out of the penalty box. They've given the Rangers nine power-play opportunities in the first period during the series. While New York has struggled on the power play (2-for-21)

&gt;""We obviously don't want that

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt;New York's two highest-paid forwards

&gt;""I see where all the questions are going. I'm not going to be talking about guys that are fighting it

&gt;Nash and Richards couldn't get away from talking about their struggles after practice Saturday.

&gt;""There's no excuses

&gt;Richards said his goal is to try to wipe out what has happened over the past five games

&gt;The Rangers do have experience in Game 6 elimination situations. They won Game 6 of the conference quarterfinals last year against the Ottawa Senators and returned home to win Game 7. However

&gt;""I'm definitely not thinking it could be over, but so far we've been doing pretty good at home.""

---

### Injury Report:

&gt;Rangers forward Ryane Clowe (undisclosed)

&gt;Capitals forwards Martin Erat (upper body) and Brooks Laich (sports hernia) are unlikely to play Sunday

|Washington|48|26|20|2|54|23  
|Winnipeg|48|25|19|4|54|23 

All tied up. So what's the next tie breaker?
&gt;The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs. If two clubs are tied, the higher percentage of available points earned in games among those clubs, and not including any ""odd"" games, shall be used to determine the standing.

~~Right now
So now we're at 9 goals for and 4 against.   
Plus whatever we get tomorrow.  
And if we win the game we'd have more goals for anyway and beat the tiebreaker.~~

EDIT: This is why you shouldn't do statistics with little sleep.   
Right now the Capitals (against Winnipeg) have 6 points for and 2 against. So we win the tiebreaker.

That puts us ahead of them.

### Big story:

&gt;  Fresh off a two-game sweep of the Winnipeg Jets

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington was probably a loss Thursday from being unofficially eliminated from Stanley Cup Playoff contention

With Washington in the midst of a brutal travel stretch -- 11 of 17 games away from Verizon Center in a 30-day span -- the opportunity to make a run at the top eight may be upon the Capitals. Seven of the next eight games (including this one) are against teams not in the top eight in the Eastern Conference

The trade deadline falls in the middle of this stretch, or he could look to boslter his team's depth for a run at a playoff spot.


**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt; New York has lost four of six games since playing the Capitals two weeks ago. Offense has been a huge problem: The Rangers have seven goals in those six games

Larry Brooks of the New York Post reported offensive help could be on the way, to New York for a late-season push. Fast was a sixth-round pick by New York in 2010.

### Players To Watch:

&gt;Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin has six goals and nine points in the past six games

---

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** John Erskine (upper body)
* **Rangers:**  Marc Staal (eye)

Jan 29 '13|[](/r/ottawasenators) 3-2|


### Big story:

&gt;   Both are closing in on a Stanley Cup Playoff berth after recent hot streaks in what could be a preview of a first-round matchup and a showdown between two of the top candidates for the Jack Adams Award (Adam Oates of Washington and Paul MacLean of Ottawa).

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;   Alex Ovechkin keeps scoring, including a showdown in Washington on Tuesday.

&gt; Ovechkin has 19 goals since March 14; he scored them in a span of 33 days and 18 games. The Capitals are 14-3-1 in that span and have gone from 29th in the NHL standings on March 12 to tied for the 11th-most points before the games of Wednesday night.

**[Senators](/r/ottawasenators):**

&gt; For so long after this season was marred by injuries to critical players

&gt; A couple of key players are back from injury now (goaltender Craig Anderson and forward Milan Michalek chief among them) and the Senators have stabilized with three consecutive victories. They will make the playoffs barring a collapse

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Ovechkin isn't alone -- Capitals defenseman Mike Green has seven goals and 11 points in the past 10 games

---

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Tom Poti (back)
* **Senators:**  Erik Karlsson (Achilles)

### Big story:

&gt;  The New York Rangers found their offense on Monday by gaining possession and going hard to the net. After scoring one goal in the first two games, in Game 3 to pull within 2-1 in the best-of-7 series. The difference was again special teams, but it flipped on Washington. The Capitals had been strong on the power play and dominant on the penalty kill, but the Rangers were much better on the power play and were perfect on the PK in Game 3. Marc Staal returned to the Rangers' lineup after missing 29 games with an eye injury.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;Washington is getting some secondary scoring from Mathieu Perreault, the Capitals surged up the standings in late March and April because of how well Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom and Marcus Johansson played and how productive they were.

&gt;They lost Games 3 and 4 with those players combining for one goal and 12 shots.

&gt;""I think we're creating chances and we're getting our chances to score, it's like that and I think if we keep playing the way we are, maybe a little better, we can score a lot of goals, I think.""

&gt;Penalties were a factor in Games 3 and 4. The Capitals gave the Rangers six power plays in Game 3 and four in Game 4.

&gt;The Rangers scored twice

&gt;Washington will play Game 5 without forward Martin Erat

**[Rangers](/r/rangers):**

&gt;Derick Brassard, Brassard picked it up in Games 3 and 4 and combined for a goal and four primary assists.

&gt;Coach John Tortorella has repeatedly praised Brassard's pass that set up Dan Girardi for a go-ahead power-play goal 59 seconds into the third period of Game 4.

&gt;""That's a hell of a play by Brass, that is creativity.""

&gt;The Rangers also are getting production out of forwards Carl Hagelin and Brian Boyle. Hagelin had a goal and two assists in Game 4. Boyle scored in Game 3 and won 25 of 37 faceoffs over the past two games.

&gt;The Rangers won't say if defenseman Marc Staal will be available for Game 5 or at any point for the rest of this series. He played in Game 3, presumably because he was experiencing some vision issues out of his right eye.

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Brassard has five points over the past two games to lead the Rangers. Derek Stepan scored the winning goal in each of the past two games. Hagelin had three points in Game 4. … Perreault scored his first two career goals in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Wednesday. Joel Ward was effective with a pair of assists.

### Big story:

&gt;   The time to party in Toronto is drawing ever closer, will end a postseason drought for Toronto that stretches back to 2004. The Capitals won't be an easy opponent, however -- they're aiming for an eighth consecutive win.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt;  It wasn't the way Washington drew up getting two points

 &gt; ""It was huge. We had a couple of games in hand here [on Winnipeg] and we took advantage of them

**[Maple Leafs](/r/leafs):**

&gt; Another first-rate effort from goaltender James Reimer and a timely power-play goal from Phil Kessel was enough for Toronto to steal a 2-0 victory from the Devils on Monday in a game where the Maple Leafs were outshot by a 32-12 margin. Thanks to numerous highlight-reel stops by Reimer

&gt; ""Obviously, ""but the old adage of hockey is, you don't critique a win and good teams find ways to win hockey games. We didn't play very good. We didn't really have our work boots on and got out-competed early in the game, but our goaltender stole us a hockey game.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Reimer is 4-0-1 in his past five starts for the Maple Leafs

### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals are the NHL’s hottest team

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; The Capitals are being driven by Ovechkin, meaning he was in on half his team’s goals over the past 10 games.

&gt;However

&gt;“We just have to keep rolling

**[Canadiens](/r/habs):**

Anyways I'm calling on the /r/caps community to help each other through these dark time. I need a place where I won't be surrounded by doom and gloom so let's have this be a thread of positivity.

I'll start:

We have seen that this Caps team is a mentally strong one compared to the teams of years past. We bounced back from a triple overtime loss and we can sure as hell bounce back from a game that we really didn't have much business winning. If the Caps play a full 60 minutes and come out hungry and playing like the team we know they can I don't see any reason we don't have a damned good shot at taking Game 6. 

Once you get to Game 7 anything can happen. We've just got to out work the Rangers Wednesday and everyone know the Rangers aren't going to make it easy for us. 

Keep the faith.

### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals are surging and trying to wrap up the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington is 11-3-1 since losing that first game of the home-and-home to Carolina, hold a two-point lead on the Winnipeg Jets and have a game in hand on them. Washington plays six of its final eight games at Verizon Center.

&gt; Captain Alex Ovechkin is tied for the NHL lead with 26 goals

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt; Carolina defeated Washington 4-0 on March 12 and took a 2-0 lead on the Capitals two days later. Washington rallied for a 3-2 victory

&gt; Losing goalie Cam Ward was a huge problem, Eric Staal and Jordan Staal, are a combined minus-28 in that span.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;   Ovechkin continued his torrid pace with a goal Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens. He has 17 goals in his past 15 games. ... Carolina has lost 13 of the past 14 games -- pretty tough to make a compelling argument for anyone being ""hot.""

Let me start out by saying, and we turned that all around, wow. How? Well I've compiled a list of the positives from the season.

  * **1. Coaching**

Seriously guys, Crabb and Volpatti) and put us in the playoffs. We played half of a season that already had half of it missing and made the playoffs, that is enough to be proud of in my opinion. The East better look out next year because Oates is serious coaching material.

* **2. The ""Young"" Guns**

Alex Ovechkin, when was the last time that happened. I mostly attribute this to the tremendous job by Adam Oates, it is pretty much common knowledge that he turned OV around, and a healthy Mike Green is a sight to behold (he needs to never go below the opposing goal line though, really).

* **3. The (new) Young Guns**

Johannson, Wilson, Beagle, Kundratek, Orlov, Holtby, Latta, who am I forgetting. But really, Orlov

* **4. Goaltending**

This is the first time in a while I thought the Caps had a sold franchise goalie. Does he let softies in, he is a prospect and still developing, by the time he has matured he will be fantastic.

* **5. New Acquisitions**

The jury is still out on Mike Ribeiro, Wolski, I'm lookin' at you! But who's that? Jack Hillen! I'll be honest, for the first half of the season I was quite indifferent, but the guy has grown on me and I see him as a positive.

**Some negatives**

We have to remain realistic. Injuries took a bit of a toll on us this year. I'm not a big fan of the time that Laich and Erat had to take off, there were moments of brilliance, but we can't blame the officials in Game 7, that was all us. It also looks like we lost some of the ""veteran effect"" with Mike Knuble, in my opinion Ribeiro is a bit too much of a yapper to serve that purpose and Brouwer isn't quite there yet. (Note: I'm not sure of all the post season free agents yet, but I'm sure there are a few negatives there.)

Well thanks for reading this wall of text if you got through it, Oates has a great system, our goalie problem appears to have been solved, we have great young and old talent a like, and our stars are beginning to become all-star like again, to summarize. 

I'd like to end all of this by saying it has been a great season and I wouldn't have spent it with anyone else but you guys here and the friends/enemies over at /r/hockey.

### Big story:

&gt; The Capitals can continue to tighten the Southeast Division race with another regulation win Friday. Winnipeg leads the Carolina Hurricanes by two points

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; It might be difficult for Washington not to use Braden Holtby again in this back-to-back situation: He hasn't allowed a goal at MTS Centre in two games this month. Holtby has made 55 saves in the two games

&gt; ""Last time they just threw everything at the net and they were hoping for a bounce or a rebound or what-not, not giving them those lanes no matter where they are on the ice to shoot the puck.""

&gt;Alex Ovechkin had a three-point game Thursday
&gt;""The intensity of the game right now for us is very important
&gt;""Tomorrow is going to be a much harder game

&gt;Defenseman Mike Green returned from injury and played 22:44. Brooks Laich played his second game of the season and had an assist.
&gt;""When these guys are back out there

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; Thursday was a stunning end to a 6-1-1 streak by Winnipeg that was capped by a 3-1 win against the Boston Bruins on Tuesday.
&gt;""It's nice that there's a short turnaround and we have a chance to redeem ourselves right away

&gt;Goalie Al Montoya was activated off injured reserve and could give Ondrej Pavelec a break -- Pavelec has made eight straight starts and played in 19 of the past 20 games.
&gt;""You have to change something,"" coach Claude Noel said, not specifically mentioning the goaltenders. ""Of course you've got to change something, you've got to look at a lot of things. I don't know what it's going to be, but tomorrow will be a new day. We get to play the same opponent, so that's a good thing.""

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Ovechkin has four goals and three assists in the past five games after going three games without a point. Forward Nicklas Backstrom has two two-point games in his past three. … Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien has seven points in his past six games. Ladd has at least one point in eight of 11 March games.

### Big story:

&gt; The Hurricanes can strengthen their hold on the Southeast Division

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; The first meeting with Carolina this season was the start of five wins in a six-game stretch that had Washington edging back into playoff contention … but three straight losses and more injuries on the back end have left the franchise closer to despair than any point since a 2-8-1 start.
&gt; A regulation loss to the Hurricanes in this contest would leave the Capitals 12 points back of Carolina and possible eight points shy of eighth place in the East. Three members of the defense corps began the season playing with Hershey in the American Hockey League

&gt; Wolski and Perreault are healthy scratches for tonight

**[Hurricanes](/r/canes):**

&gt;Carolina won back-to-back games against Florida to start March and appeared poised to grab control of the Southeast Division. One problem -- workhorse goaltender Cam Ward was hurt March 3 in the second of those wins and it was announced he'd miss 6-8 weeks.
&gt;The Hurricanes haven't missed a beat without Ward -- they've won three of four and now lead the Southeast by three points with a game in hand on second-place Winnipeg. The offense has been rolling -- 33 goals since being shutout in Washington

### Players To Watch:
&gt;Mathieu Perreault has three points in his past three games for the Capitals. Semin has 13 points in his past seven games for the Hurricanes.

---

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Brooks Laich (groin), Jack Hillin (upper body), Tom Poti (upper body)
* **Hurricanes:** Cam Ward, Joni Pitkanen (lower body)

### Big story:

&gt;   The NHL's top two goal scorers square off as the Capitals look to stretch their winning streak to seven games and stay in front of the Winnipeg Jets in the Southeast Division title race.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Washington has a two-point lead and a game in hand on the Jets

&gt;But the Capitals have their eye on the division title

&gt;""We've put ourselves in a great situation to make the playoffs and have home-ice advantage in the first round

**[Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning):**

&gt; Tampa Bay started this season 6-1-0 and scored 37 goals in those seven contests. The Lightning have remained one of the top offensive teams in the NHL -- they're third at 3.15 goals per game -- but keeping the other team from scoring has been an issue since the hot start.

&gt; The Lightning are the only non-playoff team in the Eastern Conference to boast a positive goal-differential

&gt; ""We just have a lot of things to learn

### Players To Watch:

&gt; This game also features two of the top three setup men in the NHL. Washington's Nicklas Backstrom has 12 assists in his past six games and is now third in the NHL with 37. Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis has six in his past five games and is now tied with Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby for the League lead at 41.

Craig Anderson, could show up drunk and do his job better than Semyon Varlamov. Craig who got run out of town after winning 38 games and dragging the Avalanche into the playoffs with a .917 SV% over 71 games. Who was 13-9-3 before getting in a slump where he lost 6 straight, but only gave up more than 4 goals in 1 of those games, so they gifted us Erat for Varlamov. (Indirectly)

What are beer prices like at Verizon for the games?  I usually have a few when I go out to watch each game at local sports bars but really don't feel like paying the price of 2 twelve packs for up to 4 beers.  Which leads to my next question...

Is it possible to sneak a small flask or anything into Verizon?  We had the idea of getting a beer there and pouring from a flask into our empty cups :p  Do people tend to rat you out or give you shit for doing this?

Best pre-game or post-game places to visit?  I'm native around the DC area but I've never really hung around Verizon or visited very often to know what's around.

Lastly

### Big story:

&gt;  The Capitals have won their way into first place in the Southeast Division

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; After a terrible 2-8-1 start, and none would be in the top eight of the conference at this point if not for the division winner earning a top-three seed.

&gt;Still

&gt;The schedule has been light on top teams but tough on travel/fatigue -- this contest and the one Sunday in Tampa Bay complete a stretch of 17 games in 30 days

**[Panthers](/r/floridapanthers):**

&gt; Florida's season has been a mess because of injuries and regression after a surprising division title in 2011-12

&gt;Bjugstad is huge (6-foot-6, Quinton Howden, as the Panthers try for a season-high fourth consecutive victory.


### Players To Watch:

&gt;  Green has five goals in Washington's past four games and now leads the League in even-strength goals by a defenseman with seven despite missing 13 games because of injury. … Florida's Shawn Matthias also has five goals in his past four games and has four more in 39 games (14) than he's had in any of his previous four NHL seasons with at least 50 games played.

### Big story:

&gt; These teams play twice in as many nights in Winnipeg -- the Capitals probably need a sweep to foster any fleeting hope about making the playoffs while the Jets can cement their hold on the Southeast Division lead.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; For about four weeks

&gt; Then came a lost weekend in New York

**[Jets](/r/winnipegjets):**

&gt; When Winnipeg lost to Washington at MTS earlier this month

&gt; Winnipeg still has 11 of its final 18 games at home

### Players To Watch:

&gt; Alex Ovechkin has three goals and an assist in the past four games for Washington after going the three previous contests without a point. Blake Wheeler has three multi-goal games in his past five for Winnipeg.

### Big story:

&gt; The Penguins are riding a nine-game winning streak going into Tuesday's game against a streaky Capitals club. It's no secret that the teams really don't like each other and Washington has its sights set on ending the Penguins' streak.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Despite beating Buffalo 5-3 at home on Sunday, play back-to-back games in Winnipeg and finish against the Rangers in New York.

&gt;Washington could get a boost from the return of forward Brooks Laich

&gt;Laich spoke to the Washington Post on Sunday and addressed the issue. ""I'm feeling good on the ice and I'm getting really anxious to play. I'm sure it'll be very, really wanting to get back in the lineup.""

&gt;Braden Holtby has started the previous two games against Pittsburgh

**[Penguins](/r/penguins):**

&gt; Pittsburgh's defense has become as efficient as its offense

&gt;Fellow Quebec native Pascal Dupuis is playing on the most explosive line in hockey but was vocal about the defense after Sunday's 2-1 win against Boston kept the winning streak alive. ""It's fun for a little while -- guys get points

&gt;In their last five games the Penguins have given up only five goals -- a turnaround for a team that had a goals-against average hovering around 3.0 for much of the season.

### Players To Watch:

&gt;Alex Ovechkin has goals in two of Washington's past three games and leads the team with 11. … Fleury has won his last four decisions and allowed only three goals while going 3-0-0 last week.

It wouldn't be playoff hockey unless NBC had the inevitable Rangers/Caps series. So, who do I need to look out for, what are your strengths? Your weaknesses? Spill the beans, and I'll gladly do the same. 


Rangers have sucked this year. There I said it. We were just as inconsistent as we were in the playoffs last year. It would be win one game, lose the series to the Panthers. It's been an up and down road and we would not be in the playoffs if it wasn't for Henrik Lundqvist. Do I have to say any more? He's been our backbone for quite some time now and he has no signs of cooling down. Rangers struggled all year up until the trade deadline. We were sitting in tenth place when we acquired Ryane Clowe, Derrick Brassard, Derrick Dorsett, and John Moore. All of them (excluding Dorsett who is out with an injury) made immediate impact on the team.  Since then, the Rangers went 10-3-1 (With 51 Goals), leading the way into the playoffs. I'd have to say we have been just as hot as the Caps have been

**Players To Watch**

*The Derrick's* - No matter how you spell it, he makes anyone around him look good. Derrick Brassard is another one to look out for. Since coming to the Rangers, he has 5 goals and 6 assists in 13 games, but has made plays that has lead to many scoring chances. Derrick Dorsett, who has yet to make his debut with the Rangers, is another one to watch for. He brings back the hard working play that the Rangers lost in Prust, and makes them a tougher team. 

*Clowe, and him playing well since coming to the Rangers, (8 points in 12 games), he will be a big factor when he returns to the lineup. Zuccarello, also known as The Hobbit, plays with heart on the ice. He has been hitting more (even though he is 5'6), creating MANY scoring chances, The Captain. You'll find everything a hockey player wants in Ryan Callahan

**Strengths**

Our big strengths are our defense, and with a defense built as solidly as the Rangers, and with Staal (possibly) being ready for game 1, it will be tough to find a guy who would make a defensive mistake in that lineup. Unlike last year's playoffs, where 2/3 guys where getting thirty minutes a game, and other less than ten (cough Bickel), Torts now has the ability to play everyone evenly because their defense is rounded out so nicely.

**Weaknesses**

The Power Play. My god I hate our power play. We suck. Is there anything more I can say? Take all the penalties you want because you are guaranteed to score more on our power play than we are. Also, but we make that up with having Zucc, Hags, and Brass playing on the same line with them.

**Conclusion** 

Wow I wrote a lot. I learned from my mistake last year that nothing is ever easy. Playoffs are indeed a new season. But unlike last year's team we have more scoring depth, but like I said that doesn't matter, and it was before they started being the hottest team in the NHL. Good luck to you guys, it should be fun as usual. ",,False,self,False,t3_1ddb5w

Olaf Kölzig|G|37|1989-2008|764|323|321|127|1,469

 * Olie the Goalie (AKA Godzilla) was drafted in the first round by the Caps but played most of his first year in the minors. He scored one goal and got in one fight during his time there. Kolzig’s start in the NHL was anything but good. He only played 2 games in his first year

 * Won the Vezina in 1999-2000 as he finished the season with 5 shutouts
 * In February 2008, yet lost in seven.
 * 300th win: March 12
 * Following the Capitals elimination against the Flyers, he became a free agent and signed a 1 year, $1.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.

 * On March 4, Andy Rogers, and a 4th round pick in exchange for Richard Petiot. Since his injury would make him miss the rest of the season, this was seen as Toronto buying a draft pick for his contract.
 * Retired: September 23
 * Holds virtually every Capital franchise record at his position. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_K%C3%B6lzig#Washington_Capitals_records)

|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Dale Hunter|C|1987-1998|1,294

 * Drafted 41st overall by the Quebec Nordiques in 1979, he was a fan favorite and known to be humble in the locker room and a gentleman to other players off the ice.  
 * He was traded alongside Clint Marlachuk in 1987 to the Capitals for Gaetan Duchesne
 * Hunter continued his nuiscance nature when he arrived in Washington. Soon becoming another fan favorite. In his first season he tallied 71 points and 338 penalty minutes.
 * On April 28, Hunter blindsided NY Islanders captain Pierre Turgeon several moments after Turgeon stole  the puck off a bad pass from Hunter to score a goal and make the score 5-1. Hunter's attack left Turgeon with a separated shoulder and cause him to miss all but one of his team's remaining playoff games. New NHL commissioner Gary Bettman had promised earlier to crack down on violence and suspended Hunter for 21 games of the next season. One-quarter of the season. Years later, Hunter admitted he had gone too far.
 * In 1994
 * He led the Capitals to the playoffs all but one year (1996-97)
 * March 23
 * Hunter retired in 1999,407 games. He is ranked second all-time with 3,565 regular-season penalty minutes, trailing only Dave ""Tiger"" Williams. Hunter tops the all-time list for post-season penalty minutes with 729 in 186 games. He also holds the record of most playoff games played without winning a Stanley Cup.
 * Number Retired : March 11, the former arena.
 * November 28, Hunter announced he would not return as head coach, choosing to return as coach of the London Knights, the OHL team he owns with his brother.

### Season Series:

| Date | Score | 
:--: | :--: 
Mar 5 '13 | WAS 4-3 |


### Big story:

&gt; The Bruins will try to keep pace with Montreal and Pittsburgh for the top spot in the East while the Capitals need to keep winning just to stay on the fringes of the playoff chase.

### Team Scope:

**[Capitals](/r/caps):**

&gt; Just as they were in the game against Boston
The Capitals are seven points shy of Winnipeg for eighth place in the East but have a game in hand. They also have two games against the Jets in as many nights next week
Washington did get Tom Poti back against Carolina, skated nearly 28 minutes Thursday night against the Hurricanes.


**[Bruins](/r/bostonbruins):**

&gt;Boston looks a lot like the team that won the Stanley Cup in 2011
The only issue of late has been blown third-period leads. Boston is 10-2-1 in its past 13 games

### Players To Watch:
&gt; Mike Ribeiro and Nicklas Backstrom have seven points each in the past seven games for the Capitals. … Tyler Seguin has four goals in the past six games for the Bruins.

### Injury Report:

* **Capitals:** Brooks Laich (groin)
* **Bruins:**  Chris Kelly (broken leg)

Hi

In the past, I have to face reality. Stamkos kinda sucks this year. 2 goals in the last 5 games, man? Maybe he should take up professional [diving](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gwt5q-zH9VA) instead of hockey. At this point, St. Louis is gonna pass him for the Art Ross, too. Passed up by a 37 year old dwarf. Weaksauce, Stammer.

Ovechkin has proven himself able to overcome adversity. Like growing up wearing a [hideous jumpsuit](http://sid-best.tumblr.com/post/47207392162/ovie-at-school-chilling-in-an-american-flag) and an unfortunate love for the [Sabres](http://misterirrelevant.com/index.php/2011/05/31/alex-ovechkin-sabres-childhood-photo/). Along the way, though. 5 goals in 5 games and an 8 game winning streak for his team. Oh, and the obligatory 'hot fiancee' comment goes here, too.


The bottom line is that Alex is working hard for the trophy and Stamkos isn't.  Maybe we're going to see a new Ovechkin that plays hard and doesn't throw a hissy fit everytime something go wrongs. There's no denying the league needs more adult players and fewer man-children (Looking at YOU Crosby) who can actually produce. So good on Ovi for the Rocket trophy and good luck to the Caps. Run away with the last 'Special Ed' Division title and show those Canadians how we do things SouthLeast style.",self,t5_2rouz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/1cj8ej/ovechkin_deserves_the_trophy/
