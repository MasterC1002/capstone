This whole setup should be hidden in a neat box with as few cables as possible to the outside. Basic requirements for the setup:

* WiFi (preferably 802.11*n*): It won't be placed near our router/no possibility of pulling ethernet cables

* Sound card w/ speaker or headphone out. 

* USB for connecting to the HDD. 

* no fan/noise

* Power consumption low enough to be on 24/7 (&lt; 10W)

* Suitable for general fucking around

* (see above) preferably running an established linux distro w/ good package management

I have two ideas for this: 

1. Beagleboard + USB Wifi Dongle. Seem to land at ~ €200 for the whole solution (already have the HDD)

2. hackable WiFi router converted to general purpose-computer

I know there are some legal issues but tha'ts exactly WHY a DIY hacked version would be so great becuase no inspector can see inside the ECU.

The problem withold ECU's and replacement sis

1.They are expensive for what they are.
2.they are programmed to not allow your mileage increasing hacks or adjustments. They actively counteract many things you do with aricher gas mixture so being able to fine tune your o2 sensor to not react as if there is incomplete complete just because your hydrogen o2 unit addon is making the tail pipe more 02 rich while lowering emissions would be a real benefit.

You could also make your programmable DIY car ECU do lots of other great engine monitoring logging etc and even put other chips inside to make it a real computer with an in dash display etc.

2. At least one USB1
3. Preloaded Linux (any flavor) with root access
4. Persistent storage (any: Flash/SD/HDD/SSD) - 16MB free
5. Ability to login remotely via SSH/telnet so I can setup startup scripts.
6. Housing/casing so I don't have to build my own case for it.
7. In-stock now
8. Power-adapter would be nice to have.

Don't need:

1. USB2 or above
2. Fast CPU/GPU
3. More than 128MB RAM
4. HDMI/DVI/VGA
5. Wifi

The entire job of each PC is to run: ""nc -l -p 8000"" so that data from stdin fed by a keyboard wedge (USB) device can be read by a remote app. The data will be a few bytes per second and would be no different than a human typing away on a USB keyboard.

I went through [this list](http://raymii.org/cms/p_Small_Linux_PCs_overview) and am not sure if any of them will work. SheevaPlug doesn't seem to have wired Ethernet and I don't want to get into custom JTAG development stuff.

I don't want to go Arduino low-level on this and write USB HID driver code. CottonCandy, Gooseberry don't have Ethernet. I've seen a few MK802/3 devices on AliExpress.com but don't know how reliable they are.

[CuBox](http://solid-run.com/cubox) appears to be the closest match to my requirements but it has lot more CPU/RAM/graphics than I need and goes over $100. I would rather give up on these features that aren't necessary for my usage and get a lower price. I might end up buying 10-20 of these devices in the next month and maybe a lot more in the future.

Hello all.  I'm not quite sure if this post is appropriate for this forum, selling [these](http://i.imgur.com/iCokx.jpg).  (*These are **unbranded**, and I have a shipment on the way from a factory in China.*)  

If you can pick out a name that we end up using

In any case, and would take advantage of inexpensive USPS priority shipping to allow me to offer free shipping within the US.  I plan to sell the devices for between $60 and $65, delivered.

Here are the specs

By the way

I'm looking for store name which is **fun** and almost childish, as I love his work and his style.  We'll see how that goes.  But as you can imagine, the site would not resemble a Linux ARM boutique than you've seen before.  I am very concerned about hitting the female (and adventurous men) market with new pink MK808's, for example.

I'd like to briefly describe a product for you

I don't know if this question is appropriate for this subreddit.  If it isn't

The flagship product would be an Android Mini PC, USB-to-SATA adapter, HDMI-to-DVI-D custom Android ROM flashing, pre-installed Linux distros on SD cards, micro keyboards, remote/mouse,  etc.

Why MK808?  This particular product is great for home theater, and very inexpensive.  It draws very little power.  A great computer for the masses.

Allow me to restate the specifications on this product and give a price:

* Processor: 1.6GHz Rockchip RK3066 Cortex-A9 dual core (*perhaps Amlogic as its more open
* GPU: Quad core Mali-400MP
* RAM: 1GB DDR3
* Storage: Nand Flash 8GB
* Video Out: micro HDMI
* WiFi: 150M 802.11 b/g/n (internal antenna)
* Ethernet: no
* Memory card reader: microSD (Linux bootable)
* System on a Chip: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)
* Size: 4.0 in. x 1.5 in.
* Audio: Integrated
* Ports: 1 x USB 2.0 Host, 1 X charger(mini USB) interface
* Power: 90-230V, Output: 5V/2A
* Price (free USPS Priority shipping in US): **$58.99** (7.75% tax in CA)

Hi

Last month I tried to upgrade to 12.10 or Fedora 17 and tried them both.
The driver used by default is xorg radeon which makes my computer overheats and very energy consuming

So I tried to install fglrx only to find that it doesn't support the new version of xorg so I was given the options to downgrade xorg or keep the xorg driver.

I tried to downgrade xorg and install fglrx_legacy

So I had to go back to U11.10.

Is there a solution for this? Or a solution being worked on?",self,t5_2rfd8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_devices/comments/1663j5/radeon_hd3200_and_xorg_overheating/

- NAS: must support multiple USB ports (3.0 is a plus).  Must also support multiple few terabytes harddrives.
- Entertainment system: must support HDMI and be able to play in mediocre resolution resolution at least
- Music server
- Torrent server


I could easily go with a standard desktop machine but would like to try a small form factor like CuBox.  However


Can someone please recommend a good small form factor device that has pretty good Linux support so that installing, maintaining, etc. aren't a nightmare?  Preferably the distro is also fairly mainstream.  I mainly have experience with Debian and RHEL flavors.
