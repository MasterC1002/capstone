Dress Code: Clubs in Korea are not as strict compared to the super clubs of the US. Key rules: No sandals or open-toed shoes. No shorts. The dress code is more strict south of the river. It's pretty non-existent at many Hongdae clubs.

Tips: Always check for the sites for events. Information for a free entry before midnight will usually be available. Every weekend multiple clubs have events so don't waste your money on cover fees! Also, 까지 - until) and also how many people you can bring with the app (본인 - self, 동반#인 - with # people). Usually you can gain free entry with the app before midnight along with 2 friends.

My Top Picks (by area):

* Sinsa/Apgujeong - Holic
* Gangnam - Octagon
* Cheongdam - Answer
* Itaewon - Boombar
* Hongdae - Mansion

1361524772.0,190hof,Why are Koreans so spatially inconsiderate? (rant),CoreaComplaint,90,36,125,"I just made a public outburst and feel bad about it yet I think that in reflection

I'm a foreigner whose been living/teaching in Korea for five years. I've lived in Seoul, and Ansan (now living in Itaewon). I've had this complaint about Koreans in Korea for quite sometime but every time I tell someone about it, people either don't know what I'm talking about or in the case of my Korean wife, make excuse after excuse for it (usually: ""Korea is a small country with a large population so that's why it's like that). 

Anyway, I never saw people block both sides of the escalator in a crowded place. Sometimes adjumma in Korea will block both sides despite the large thumping noise people make announcing that they're walking and want to go through--then they always refuse to move, so in my case, I just take to walking over them which has got me called a ""gesekki"" and other unpleasant things. For a 빨리 빨리 culture people sure don't like to exert themselves unless they have to.

Subway cars and elevator doors are the same. Koreans never wait for passengers to unload before loading themselves. My outburst today was caused by this happening to me twice in a row. I was carrying a heavy bag at Seoul station (airport line) so I took an elevator to the platform and when the doors open at the bottom

Kids and old people are the worst too. Kids will block entire sidewalks/convenience store entrances/hallways/everywhere and won't move or even feel acknowledge it unless you shove them and even then, or pretty much anything. Adjosshi seem to enjoy bumping into each other. It's not limited to physicality too... there is no volume control either. I was in one of those coffee shops that is for studying (there are signs telling everyone to be quiet and you can borrow books there) when an adjumma strolled in and talked on her phone at a deafing volume for hours (annoyingly--calling her kid's hagwon and complaining that their kids weren't getting enough homework and all that bullshit). 

Don't even get me started on driving. I rode a motorcycle here for three years and stopped because it was causing me so much stress. It got especially bad when I moved to Seoul and had to deal with so much retardedness on the road so I sold my bike. Just the other week I saw an adjumma swerve across five lanes of traffic on the 한남대교 bridge so she could make the exit ramp. She didn't signal or anything so it was no surprise when I heard a loud *clap* and turned around (I was in a taxi) to see her car stuck halfway into a minivan. 

I'm really annoyed about this. People always blame the population density or Confucianism but I think that's total bullshit. Koreans are such nice people and I do love living here so don't get the wrong idea, into the most dense areas in Tokyo or Osaka and rarely experience this and when it does happen, people always apologize which allows me to let it go and not carry it around as baggage. Here people never apologize or even seem to care. 

So I'm asking

A good friend of mine has recently been promoted to the manager for a small dive bar in Sinchon. The bar has been a part of Sinchon music culture for the last 20 years. I've been DJing here on and off for a few hours a week for the last 8 months or so and its been one of the coolest places I've had the pleasure of experiencing here - it caters to interesting crowds

The last few months

We've done lots of cultural events in the past, trivia nights, party nights, etc. but we are always looking for more stuff. We are looking for collaborators who have ideas and the motivation to bring people together, share culture, share music, share food, mics

I really don't want to see my favorite bar turn into another top 40 playing cliche. Really hope to hear from some of the creative minds housed here on Reddit. Below is the facebook page

One night when drunk I stole a chair from a Lotteria because I was drunk and stupid. Eventually it came back to me, agreed to pay any fines, returned the chair. Everything seemed to be going fine until I was told recently that the police were not allowing the Lotteria manager to settle this out of the legal system. According to the police, due to recent foreigner crimes, they want to treat this as a serious criminal matter.

Now, but I was wondering if anyone here had any sort of constructive advice they could offer. I'm very much in the dark here, and at the risk of inviting a whole spectrum of answers, I'm curious as to the maximum legal penalty here. Deportation is what I've got as a worst case scenario in my head right now, but could this potentially be any worse?

1345899950.0,ysypq,Here's all the proof you need that Mannam Volunteer Association is the same thing as Shinchonji Church of Jesus,fostergregd,50,12,63,"There was a [recent submission here about the Mannam Volunteer Association](http://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/yk3gz/whats_up_with_this_mannam_volunteer_association/) that's always recruiting foreigners.

The Mannam group is currently preparing for their ""World Peace Festival in Seoul"" on September 16.  [Here's the invitation on Koreabridge](http://koreabridge.net/event/mannam-world-peace-festival-seoul-september-2012).

In the comments of that Koreabridge post

The Mannam invitation doesn't mention anything about a Church

The other invitation (to the same event!) says the following:

&gt;A highlight of the Olympiad Heaven’s Culture events will feature a spectacular 100,000 years of work.

&gt;The Shinchonji National Olympiad will showcase the purpose and will of God in the New Testament—to create God’s kingdom

&gt;The glory of God’s fulfillment

Here's a Youtube video of the [2008 Shinchonji Olympiad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMujBYY_qVo).  It is seriously creepy.

Shinchonji (""New Heaven and Earth"") Church was founded by Lee Man-Hee.  Lee Man-Hee is also [the Honorary Chairman of Mannam](http://mannam.org/en/content.php?p=about/greet).

I can draw no other conclusion than this:  **the Mannam Volunteer Association is a front group for the Shinchonji Church.  They use Mannam to attract foreigners to their events.  They are dishonest in doing so**

EDIT: [This blog](http://www.shinchonji.org/wp/) is apparently run by the church.  I'll just post a few quotes here.

&gt;Currently

&gt;Just as Jacob physically gave birth to twelve sons in the past and created the twelve tribes of Israel (Gn 49), and is bearing twelve crops of fruit every month.  This is proof that he is the one who overcomes (Mt 19:28; Rv 22:1-2).

&gt;God’s new kingdom, and it is a new work of creation.  It is the only kingdom and temple of God in this world.

&gt;Zion Christian Mission Center, that is, the word of revelation which explains how the prophecies have been fulfilled. It is also the place which creates the twelve tribes.  Therefore, this is the place where the throne of the spiritual world and God are with.  This is the only place in the whole world that teaches this new song, which is the word of revelation.

That's a creepy cult, and runs a bible center that is ""the only place in the whole world that teaches this new song, which is the world of revelation.""

What is the connection between Mannam Volunteer Association and Shinchonji Church?  What are they hiding from us?

I come back and that same guy I saw smoking is IN MY DOORWAY. I am stunned and mostly freeze...I say hello in English and ask him what he's doing in Korean. At first he said that he wanted to talk to me INSIDE my house and explain, so it was hard for me to make out his words, so all I really heard was ""외국인"", ""힘들어"" and ""범죄인 아니에요"" and something with a similar meaning to ""나쁜 뜻이 아니에요."". (He only spoke Korean to me).
 
All I could really say was to not do it again ""다시 안하세요"".

I'll make this quick. My name's Brad and I've been an English instructor in Korea for roughly seven years. In all of that time I don't ever recall coming across an English storybook for kids about Korea. So

It's loosely based on how my dog went from being a homeless pup in rural Korea to being here with me in Seoul. I wrote and illustrated the whole thing, I'll ship it anywhere, and I think Korean kids will get a kick out of it (attn: English teachers and parents).

Check out www.baekguwithbrownspots.com and let me know what you think.

Cheers.

* [Dave's ESL](http://www.eslcafe.com/): Forums for discussion and postings of jobs. Forums can be very helpful but are also often characterized as being full of bitter ex-pats.

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/): A sort of Facebook for professionals. You need to create an account to have access. You can post your experience and create connections to others on the network. Many job postings in Seoul.
* [USA Jobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/): Listings for jobs put up by the US government. Many postings in Korea and other regions of the world.
* [Work 'n' Play](http://worknplay.co.kr/): Typically lists teaching jobs but it is worth checking for the occasional non-teaching job that is posted. Non-teaching jobs on this site often still revolve around education though.

Anyway, he refused to pay rent because he didn't know the difference between key money and a deposit (he thought his 5mil deposit would cover rent indefinitely) so I was evicted three times and he had to keep putting me up in new apartments.

He blocked my phone numbers when I came back and blocked me on Kakaotalk. Instead of going there in person (he has a very short temper), and he said if I went to the labour board/police, he still wouldn't pay and would have me deported (he said he'd make something up as I did nothing wrong). His father is stinking rich and foots the bill for everything, even his entire hagwon (it's been losing money forever because he can't get new students). 

I went to the labour board, he won't show up. They don't seem to be able to force him into doing anything. 

The next step is court but I know him well enough to know that he won't show up then either and if he does

I'm a bit worried. The last time this happened was when I was working in Canada as a university student and the security company I was working for successfully weaseled their way out of paying me what they owed me.

Most people seem to run into these guys on the subway or out in the street somewhere. I guess where I live there not so much into that. Anyways, I went to the Korean class for about two months once a week. It seemed normal. Then, I got invited to the big rally at Seoul Grand Park a couple weeks ago. I thought it was no big deal. I was told it was a peace rally for foreigners standing up against the North Koreans. Well, there was no North Korean talk, but there was a lot of talk about peace. It was really a bunch of speeches that were really vague, could apply to anyone but really didn't mean anything. It seemed odd but I didn't question anything. We were in a public space free to leave, kind of..I had come on a bus with my group so I had to stick with them for the duration of the event. Overall

Fast forward to last night. Someone posted on facebook about cults in Korea. The video was from the same bogus peace rally that I attended and the guy was being harassed by Mannam people for recording the event. I messaged the person who brought up the video and they told me the leader of the korean class I was attending is a Mannam member. Another person he knows who volunteers is a self devout SCJ member. Also

To me

Mannam has also gained access to the US Army Base. They are working with volunteer organizations on the base. Overall

You are always meeting people here at subway stop / exit number. It usually works out ok but its good to have a way to communicate while en route. I looked into renting a cell phone for my month visit and it was scary. The fees were almost $10 USD/day and it made me nervous that they could charge me whatever if I didn't understand the contract.

Solution:

I have a US cell phone with the data plan deactivated. Yours wouldn't need to be deactivated, they have Kakao. All the trains have Olleh Wifi so just go into any Ministop/GS25/7-Eleven once you land (they exist in the airport) and pick up a couple wifi codes. Just ask for ""Olleh Wifi"", it might take a bit but they'll get it. You can pay ￦1100 for 1 hour or ￦3300 for 24 hours. Then, when you board a train or are standing on the platform just go to any website, Olleh's website comes up, choose enter prepaid code, a little box will come up asking for your code, passport number and email and voila

Please note I always have to click in &amp; out of the little code box for it to work right. Don't start typing if there are still alphabet characters in it or you get stuck in this crazy error loop. Also

5. If your question about Korea can be answered within 5 minutes on Google, please do some research before asking legitimate questions that only people with experience in Korea can answer. 

6. The 'report' button is **not a super-downvote.** Just because you don't like the content doesn't mean the mods will remove it. Hide it for yourself if it offends you.

**Burger B**: This is my favorite burger place in Seoul. Great taste, but they can be had for 4,000 won or so for a side. Burger, beer and fries comes out to about 15,000 won. Pretty sure the reason this place is my favorite though is because they carry the Indica IPA, which is delicious if you like IPAs. They also carry Alley Cat beer along with other beers typical of Korean bars.

**Brooklyn, so it's not my favorite. It's in 서래마을 (Seorae Maeul, the ""French Quarter"" of Seoul) and you can cab or walk from the subway, but it's a bit of a ways (particularly for a 강복'er). The place is small, so you'll likely have to wait. That being said, the place has delicious burgers and amazing milkshakes. I think it was like 15,000-20, depending on the drink.

**All American Diner**: A main staple of Itaewon and is the place to go for a greasy diner burger. I think the burger was like 11, but nothing to write home about.

**J's Burgers**: This was in Ilsan near 백석역 (Baeksuk Station) a few years ago, but a bit on the pricey side, like 12,000-15,000 won for just the sandwich if my memory serves me correctly. Has a bit of notoriety though because the proprietors are a Korean K-pop singer, [제이](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_%28singer%29), and her mother.

**Yaletown**: Small bar in 신촌 (Shinchon) that is supposedly run by two Korean-Americans. They have a nice American style burger that can really hit the spot and I remember it being like 9

**W Burger**: A burger chain that makes decent burgers. Reminds me a bit of like a Ruby Tuesdays' burger or something. Nothing you'd expect to be amazing,000 won for a burger set (fries and drink).

**Kraze Burger**: Another burger chain in Korea that is very popular among Koreans,000 won for a burger, fries and a drink but are still hungry afterwards (at least I am). Their burgers are like extra-large sliders with vegetables. The vegetables are nice and fresh though.

**Burgermine**: I've yet to actually go here, drink and a ticket to the burger bar, which is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet bar where you can make your own burger. If I go in the near future, I'll update.

**Fast-food and others**: Anything from a convenience store is going to not be good. Some of the random burger sellers on the street in Itaewon and other areas have great drunk burgers, but that's chicken. Lotteria sucks. Lotteria's only redeeming quality is that they have these little shake pouches to add different flavor to your french fries.

If anyone knows of others

Coming from a lifetime in a western country straight into the ROK military can be a jarring experience


Also


I guess I'll start. (long post


I grew up in the States, Army strong, you know?)


Feb 2009 I flew to Korea and went to Nonsan to start my training. No specialty MOS.. just as a 1111 소총수. The first week I was there


When I graduated boot camp, we had very strict 똥군기. Basically, it's stupid 군기 that is mostly pointless. I think that the mentality was that because our post wasn't a physically demanding place like the DMZ, the senior enlisted guys thought that they should keep us in check by applying mental strain instead. Corporal punishment was very much still alive and kicking, and the first few months as a 이등병 were pretty rough. I remember being kicked in the back while I was squaring away(literally your blanked needed to have a 90 degree angle 각!) my 모포 sitting cross-legged, because apparently, you're supposed to do that shit while kneeling. I did the invisible chair stress position a few times while standing post at night because I couldn't memorize all the 군번s of everyone in the company, etc.. the list goes on. Also


Moreover


Needless to say the first few months I wasn't a happy camper.

 
I think a lot of the issues did stem from the fact that western culture is inherently different from Korean culture. Western countries have more lax hierarchy and everyone seems to be more on the same level. In Korea, it was hard to take orders for somebody who had enlisted 1 month prior to me and salute them. It felt insulting or something. However, eventually I got the hang of it and just kinda developed a different version of me. I had the normal me, who was a normal college kid and the ROKA soldier me. Once I was in the persona, I had no problem fitting in.


Once I started putting my time in, You can basically order your privates around and you can do anything you want around the barracks for the most part. Want something from the PX and don't wanna leave the room? Send a private. Squad bay looking dirty? Make the privates scrub down the floors with brushes. Even the 병장s will now recognize that you've earned your ""짬""(salt) and accept you as part of their senior club. By this time, I had spent more than a year with most of them anyway so everyone was pretty buddy buddy and the hierarchy was very relaxed. I ended up being good friends with guys 3-4 months senior to me that used to smoke me when I used to be a private.


Eventually, I really wanted to go to work and translate but when I was a sergeant, I hated going. I would volunteer for 작업(working parties) whenever they were available and just chill outside and shoot the shit with the other guys while the privates and PFCs did most of the work..lol! Hands down the last few months were the best.


Finally by Christmas of 2011


In retrospect, and I learned to not take anything for granted. I have gotten pretty much straight As in school since and gotten my shit together. Also, because I've experienced all this nasty shit like bootcamp, doing demeaning shit for months, training, 유격, and a few 30km full gear marches, it also made me super patriotic and now I fly a Korean flag patch on my backpack. 


Some nights when I'm sitting at home doing nothing, but it was stupid shit, like.. 'oh fuck I'm gonna get smoked tomorrow by the staff sergeant because so and so didn't get done..' and not important stuff like 'oh fuck if I don't get this internship I'm probably not going to get a job..'


Anyways


TL:DR - My time in the ROKA was shit but in retrospect it helped me out in life and I miss it.

1366727127.0,1cxqap,The Master Hamster Herder of Muge 1 Dong,,23,2,3,"Working in a small kindergarten and English hagwon was at least interesting at times.

As with many such schools

The only problem with hamsters is that they are excrement and urine producing machines. I was most impressed at their water/food throughput rate—those furry little critters went at soiling their nest with gusto—and accordingly

The Korean kindergarten teachers would therefore have to change the wood shavings, one massive obstacle to this undertaking. They were, to a woman, terrified of the hamsters. Who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of those dumpling-sized beasts?

One day at about 2:00 pm I received a delegation of pretty young kindergarten teachers, Trapper PDKL45—Hamster Man.

The first hamster catchin’ session was a fiasco, until I would finally seize one of the little beasts and cup it between two hands to deposit it into a temporary hamster holdin’ pen.

It was then that inspiration hit.  I got a small paper coffee cup, to be swiftly placed into the little hamster jail.

It was only a few days later and I was getting a coffee at Starbucks. I casually looked at their Grande sized paper cups, armed with the 475 ml paper cups I put on my desk at work, I became a hamster herding machine, able to shift industrial quantities of hamsters in mere seconds.

It was a golden time in many respects. I became a hamster herding legend

So help me compile a comprehensive list of all these mannerisms. Here's what I think I've learned so far:

* We all know that the way you speak Korean is incredibly important.

* It's impolite to ask for things directly. And it is especially against tradition to speak openly about money. Business gets tricky

* Check the degree of your bow when greeting someone

* Shake hands using both hands or touch the left hand to your right arm.

For drinking alcohol:

* When drinking alcohol

* When you pour for them

* If they slightly raise their glass while you're pouring that's a sign to stop pouring.

* You can not decline a drink. 

* When an older person is pouring for you, your hand, your wrist, different parts of your arm, your shoulder or your chest/stomach.

* When ingesting alcohol in front of any older person

When eating:

* When eating with an older person don't use your left hand for anything. Keep it by your side

* Do not eat any of the dishes before the most respected person has taken from it (even side dishes).

* It might be considered rude to the person who cooked if you drink water or tea while eating. 

* Never stab any food with your chopsticks to pick it up.

* It's okay

* When having very spicy food

* Apparently there is a wrong way to hold chopsticks.

* Your mouth should never touch the plate.

In the end, especially to dispel any negative vibes sent our way as foreigners.",,False,self,t5_2qiog,1338699211.0,,

Food is amazing. I weigh at around 55kg, plus the soju and makgeolli with fried chicken or ddeokbokki at night.

I'm in the middle of my second stay in Korea.  Over these two visits I feel like I've been pretty close to diverse parts of the education system (without having been a teacher here myself).  Right now I'm doing some work at a lower tier four year trade school.  I'm also involved with some government-run education events.  Last year I was at Yonsei in Seoul

I'm not shocked or upset by Korea's education system, taekwondo, soccer).  When I wasn't doing either of those I was either relaxing or pursuing the kinds of fleeting hobbies you have when you're 16 years old.  

I have friends who say they never attended a hagwon, at school and study hall since he needs to take the big college entrance exam.

Even without this extra six hours per day of cramming, I do feel like my peers in America don't look quite as nauseous when they recall their adolescence.  Even at the college I'm staying at right now students will disappear into their rooms for three and four hours a day for a week frantically studying for a very short test.

*What gives?  Is the time spent studying anything important?  Is all that time really spent studying at all?

They always have *long* investigative ""Feature"" pieces that are pretty insightful into Korean social issues and aren't the typical foreigner vs korean stuff. No weird alien

You can go way back in their [archive](http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/list/List.aspx?gCat=020101) and find stuff on gambling addiction, and one thing I'm very interested in: Koreans' unique twist on modern, urbanized, technology-driven life. They also profile ""unique"" Koreans like a Korean who became successful in a strange way.

For example, they always go in depth with stats, interviews, etc and divide the article into different sections that present the problem, flesh it out, then explain how people are trying to solve the problem. Best of all, it's not propaganda or trying to ""promote"" Korea in any way. If anything

My girlfriend is a teacher who will be returning to Korea in the beginning of 2014.  

I would like to be able to stay with her longer than 90 days if possible without having to make trips to Japan every 3 months. I am willing to do this if there is not an alternative.

I have checked several websites

I am wondering if anyone has gotten a ""tourist visa"" and how long they were able to stay in Korea.

 - Have been to Korea twice before (military)
 - Clean record

This is kind of off topic from Korea

My head teacher (at a kindergarten hagwon) has a problem with yelling at the students until they start to cry, I was going to go home.  She started to tell me that what she did was very normal in Korea. 

I like my  students a lot

The kids are less disciplined when they are with me

1370308453.0,1fmduo,A Collection of Photo Galleries From South Korea.,Bbiotech,19,3,17,"One of the main reasons I come to this subreddit is to get a feel for South Korea. I have a lot of interest in places I probably wont go to any time soon and I took a lot of interest in South Korea in particular. I find looking at pictures can be a lot of fun so I decided to make a post with some of the good picture galleries I've found of South Korea. I'm trying to give a good amount of variety and sticking to websites that aren't extremely tedious to sort though.

I plan on edditing in more later

1. [A big collection with lots of variety. Very easy to look at lots of pictures at once.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/seoulkorea/with/8597060248/)

2. [A fairly small gallery of photos

3. [A bunch of nice photos from a wallpaper site. I'm not sure if they are actually all from Korea since the site has no information on the photos

4. [A few gallerys of nature and temple photos. Smooth to sort through but kind of annoying when you want to look at a larger version since hover zoom doesn't work

5. [Some pictures from Redditor bloody_hell of Gyeongbok Palace at night. The pictures give a cool impression of you being there with some movement blurs. Some people might not like that but I think it makes them unique.](http://imgur.com/a/SlYtg)

6. [Pictures of Mt.Wolchulsan taken by Redditor RiceAndRamen. A small collection of photos but they are nice quality and have a really nice view of farmland from the top of the mountain.](http://imgur.com/a/mQH7a#6)

7. [A large variety of different galleries from Seoul that have lots of different themes. Pretty slow to look through all the pictures however.](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/seoul/images)

8. [A few galleries of different places/themes in South Korea. Lays out all the pictures at once so it's pretty easy to sort through.](http://bayimages.net/photos/korea/)

I also want to add my favorite picture. It's a photo of a street corner in Incheon. It just gives a really nice feel to it with the colors of the building signs

1368082745.0,1dzlk1,Anyone currently studying in a graduate program in Korea?,KEH_Linguist,23,5,22,"Let me start off by saying that this is not another, or if other foreign students from Western countries have encountered the same issues. Please keep in mind that what follows is generalized and based mostly on what I've observed and heard:

1. There is little to no interest on publishing anything outside of Korea.

2. There is no driving research focus for the department

3. Goals and standards for the program (including assignments and tests) are horribly vague.

4. Lack of academic integrity with lots of copying and pasting and no citations.

5. Many students have a weak theoretical background and it shows in the quality of the work.

5. Students seem more concerned about impressing the professors than with actually understanding the material.

Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg for all the difficulties of studying in Korea. The problem is that when it comes down to it, but they seem complacent. I get the feeling that most people are here to get a degree so they can leave and go become professors. No one seems to be interested in doing very meaningful research that fits into the larger field of linguistics. There is some potential here, but not many people seem to care. I'm afraid this might be a reflection of the looks over substance mentality that is rampant over here.
