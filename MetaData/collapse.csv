1338809471.0,uk1ug,"So, I'm unsubscribing...",,808,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uk1ug/so_im_unsubscribing/

According to the sidebar this subreddit is to discuss things like peak oil, infrastructure, recycling, and scavenging.  All I've been seeing from this subreddit are hysterical posts from mostly questionable sources which seem to imply that everyone on here is some kind of chicken little screaming about how the sky is falling.

I know that the majority of you are probably going to say that I just don't get it and that I'll be sorry that I didn't heed your warning signs but, I would be 500 times better off than you because instead of spending all my time scouring the internet looking for proof that people are suffering, I actually make connections within my community, grow plants, and use renewable energy.  

The problems that I've started having with this subreddit are the same ones I always end up having with communities that are focused on collapse.  At some point every time you see someone else in the world who is suffering in some way you don't react with compassion but

To the mods: I suggest that you start enforcing some rules or that you change the subreddit sidebar to reflect what /r/collapse is really about that way you won't have to deal with people unsubscribing because they are tired of seeing every conspiracy theory under the sun appearing in their newsfeed.",,t5_2qhw9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uk1ug/so_im_unsubscribing/

Right now, fracking, tar sand mining, are about 3 or 4:1.  Not that great, but still worth it when oil is selling for over $100 a barrel.

The reason nuclear power never took over the world is this: when you factor in the costs of mining the radioactive materials, safely disposing of the waste products, etc. then you're really getting something like 2:1 or 3:1.  Not that great at all.

&gt;Although the process is still in the early developmental stages and needs to take electricity from the national grid to work

They have figured out how to turn air and carbon dioxide into liquid fuel.  That's interesting.  But the fact that they ADMIT it will require power from the electric grid means that it's not actually generating energy.  It's just using one kind of energy (electricity) to produce a fuel that can later be burned.  Oil isn't amazing because it's a liquid fuel.  It's amazing because it gives us 10 times more energy than we burn in getting it out of the ground!",,t5_2qhw9,1350666795.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/11r6w1/no_peak_oil_has_not_been_solved/

Sometimes it's the day before payday, from that moment of realization that you're broke until the next payday, a matter of living on what resources you've already got - and no more.

At first I didn't understand how much these realizations that I was broke were affecting my mood. I thought, but I was holding up pretty well.

It took a very small reversal of fortune to really point out to me how unhappy I was when I couldn't leave the house. I started tutoring and got paid in cash. The last time that I got paid in cash was the day after I realized I was broke. I went from having two dollars in my pocket to having twenty-two dollars in my pocket.

Synopsis:

In the not-too-distant future

But on the island of Manhattan

As one of the world’s last remaining and fully functioning cities, Maddox runs a lottery program, which offers its winners the chance to escape what is now a brutal and desperate existence in the real world, and instead begin a privileged life in the safety and comfort of a city that most will only ever dream about again.

But


TL;DR - I've written a novel based on collapse and it's free for a few days on the Amazon Kindle Store.

**People are forgetting the Human variable**

In the grand scheme of things I believe a complete economic collapse of society is highly unlikely. I have a few reasons for this:

*The people with the wealth want to stay that way.* All the rich and wealthy out there are making their money on the backs of the every day worker and laborer. They know full well the implication of letting the economy collapse; they no longer have any power or wealth. If money becomes useless

*The majority of people can't be bothered with it.* We all know people who look at the economic scene and expect someone to fix it. Or they think they can elect one person into political office that will somehow magically fix everything. These are the people that will accept whatever happens in the economy so long as they have their iTunes

And even when people can't just go to the store because they are out of work, why not you and I when we need it?

And if you think it will get worse than that

**But my argument has holes**

Yes

But what if we look to the past, or in this case entire economic zone, to crumble it would be a global one.

Our communication and business is so entirely intertwined now that we are literally all leaning on one another. And because of this

Now, but rather than talk about how messed the euro is, why don't people here put their collective thoughts together on how to better respond to this crisis.

I hate that wonderful cultures are oppressed or exterminated. The Native Americans knew how to live off the land and they had a strong sense of community. But the Europeans gave them smallpox blankets so they could exploit the resources of the New World. Users of psychedelics are arrested and imprisoned because they posed a threat to war and consumerism. 

I feel like I have woken up from the Matrix and billions of other people are still dreaming. Hypnotized by the television, and cheap oil. Believing the lies that society tells them. We are making progress. People are slowly waking up, but it's going to take a major event to wake up a majority of people. When the storms his South, people praised god for keeping them alive, while still denying climate change.

I am glad that oil is running out and governments will lose control. The population will plummet and people will focus on what really matters. We have abused the Earth and each other

TL;DR I am glad the collapse is coming. I think the world will be a better place afterwards. I hope we finally get our shit together and respect human rights.

**EDIT**: Wow, and angry, and I am. I just feel like I got the short end of the societal stick. This society is so ruthless. If one is not born with certain advantages, then life is a lot harder. Many people are born with disadvantages that many people are very unsympathetic about. I know it could be worse. I could have been born as a starving African (no offence). I've been an outcast (or weird) all my life. As a kid, my peers thought I was funny, but once puberty hit, my peers hated me and I felt like few adults even cared. People want you to behave and not be hyper-active or gay or atheist. After a while society wore me down to the point where I have embodied the counter-culture and become very anti-social. I piss people off just by being myself

This was more of a rant about my disdain for this society and the way Mother Earth has been destroyed in the name of profit, slow death. I should have chosen my words more carefully. Sorry for offending some of you, but I appreciate the people who gave good advice and comments.

There is this horribly flawed notion among the prepperazi that if you have a well-stocked larder you can somehow drag the past into a vastly changed future and make it work.  This is folly.  Under the best-case scenario you delay your demise a year or two while you gnaw on the last of your Spam cans.  Under the worst-case scenario you've merely made yourself a whopping target for anyone with a few bullets and a lot of hunger.

The only reasonable approach for true believers is to collapse now and avoid the rush later.  Buy some land.  Learn to grow food.  (Devilishy difficult if you've never done it before

I'd take a three-acre organic farm, and a good AR-15 over all the 'preps' and firearms now uselessly decorating the hidey holes of America.  And, if you farm you get to live like a free person and immediately enjoy the fruits (literally in this case) of your labors.  There is a practicality to it that reveals the flawed thinking by all this useless caching and tactical gear fetishism that seems to have a strangle grip on the throats of Prepper America.

Fortunately we have been presented with some raw

As I was sifting through all of Bloomberg’s propaganda on the latest U.S. trade numbers (and trying to latch onto a few facts)

…American companies also bought more consumer household items

Exports increased 0.7 percent to $178.8 billion

The great U.S. economy

Reflecting the broad-based collapse of the U.S. economy, and even gasoline are now being exported in large quantities, month-after-month by U.S. refineries. Recall that it was only four, short years ago that many American politicians were alarmed by the crisis of the “lack of U.S. refining capacity”. No new refineries have been constructed in the U.S. in more than 30 years, and at that time those refineries were straining to meet the demand of solely the U.S. domestic market. With that domestic market collapsing, these refineries are now straining to find enough foreign buyers to unload all of their inventories.

[Chart: U.S. petroleum imports/exports chart](http://bullionbullscanada.com/images/stories/usoilimportsexports.jpg)

Given these facts alone, what does that say about the rest of the (decaying) U.S. economy?

Let us not forget that the U.S. population continues to grow. More people using much, this steadily growing population has been using much less electricity, going back to around 2007.

Mark Lundeen provided a very detailed analysis of the consumption of U.S. electricity in a recent commentary. It shows U.S. electrical consumption peaking in approximately 2006, the supposed “U.S. economic recovery” has only resulted in roughly half of that lost demand being restored.

And the suppression of the ego means the defeat of the dominators, the materialists, the product peddlers. Psychedelics return us to the inner worth of the self, to the importance of feeling immediate experience. And nobody can sell that to you and nobody can buy it from you, so the dominator culture is not interested in the felt presence of immediate experience. But that's what holds the community together.

I currently sail as a vessels third officer for a major shipping company. What i've learned so far is that going to sea and being in a self sufficient WROL situation have many parallels. When your at sea you and your crew are more or less everything from the ships navigator to the plumber, doctor and anything else in between not to mention your making your own water and electricity. Shipboard life offers a lot of opportunity to hone practical and technical skills that one day may prove useful in a wrol situation.


Emergencies: 
In this modern-age of electronics and global communications todays ships benefit from multiple ways of being able to call for help when disaster strikes. While help almost always arrives it sometimes will not arrive for hours or even days and by that point the help may come too late. 

Two things iv'e noticed that often separate success from disaster at sea is training and drills. I believe this to be the case with prepping as well. When possible try and do drills with your family going through numerous things such as first aid related topics well as contingencies in the event of a house fire

Depending on the ship and company we usually have a minimum of 2 drills a month consisting of fire/emergency drills as well as boat drills. 
The drills often start with breaking out the firefighting gear and carrying out mock search and rescue

Often the ships medical officer will run mock triage as well as go through the procedures with crew that are not immediately engaged with the drill at hand. This could include going over basic first aid CPR or AED training. the prepping counterpart to this is generally the same. 

Eventually the drill escalates to abandonment of the vessel (worst case scenario) (The prepping counterpart of this would be a mock bug out) it is essential to muster the ships crew with their immersion suits and bug out bags

I would recommend that you too hold a mock bug out for your family at least twice a year. 

CBRN preparedness at sea and in Prepping. In the prepping world

If you were interested in small steps you can take here are some tips. At sea we preach time, distance from the event, seek deep shelter)

One thing we do aboard ship that can be done at home is rigging a chemical wash down system. This is very useful in decontaminating decks from chemical residue and even radiological fallout. Granted we do this on steel decks so your results may vary but its something to keep in mind. 

Some ships wash down systems are more elaborate than others

(I'm currently taking a class on Shipboard CBRD which includes a lot of good info including plotting fallout and decontamination and what not. If your interested shoot me a PM and ill see what i can disseminate once my class is concluded )

Security: 
Some areas of the ocean are straight up indian territory, you'll have to decide on your own. For example going through pirate waters in daylight we often try to be very visible often with an armed deck watch. This is often a big enough deterrence to send pirates in the other direction upon seeing an alert and armed crew. At night however we may choose to run dark and fast slipping through unnoticed, becoming visible when attacked.

You can apply the same concept

If your not comfortable with firearms get comfortable with them, but thinking outside of the box in a must. All in all vigilance and a well maintained and competent watch is paramount. Additionally it might be wise to keep a log book for the watch to note any thing of interest i/e maintenance/house keeping issues or security issues whether it be armed contact or noticing that someone in the neighborhood doesn't belong and is casing houses.  

Accounting:
The last thing i want to talk about is the accounting aspect of prepping. Its often overlooked and i'm not sure how many of us actually do it but it is an important aspect of being a prepper.

At sea we keep log books for everything from the last time we had a boat drill, stores, maintenance and so on. 

You can also keep logs for medical supplies, ammo, general supplies and maintenance, this will ensure your fully stocked within acceptable expiration dates and have equipment in working order.

Log books also help with accountability with your survival party or in my case ships crew. It insures that all personnel are doing what their supposed to be doing and a system of oversight is installed. safety and survival depend on it. 

(Anyone interested in how to keep a proper log pm me and ill put up a post on that soup to nuts)

Basically all of our problems (social, physical and international) today start with the lack of sensibility, morality and sustainability in our practices and thus we cannot meet our potential as human beings through civilization. The real sickness is consumer culture because it is keeping people narrow-minded, placated and obedient so they can keep consuming things they don’t need with money that they barely have. It is materialism at its worse but it is also undoing itself and tearing through the social/political fabric in a debt-austerity-totalitarian spiral. 

This excessive materialism has come into existence through a form of manipulation by our leaders and because the majority of the public refuses to question it and apply the simple truths. Before discussing any of this though, to avoid and defuse distressing situations through moral intelligence and be aware of the complex universe through peaceful self-reflection and exercises while attaining self realization through your own actions. In extension, here are similar idealistic things that would serve as a cornerstone of our civilization: finding a cure for or preventing cancer, fixing roads and bridges, having communities of healthy populations with increasing longevity through preventative medicine, green energy with no pollution and a sustainable economy that provides liquid exchanges for all human needs to avoid starvation, despair and houselessness; but the truth is that none of these are things are being realized in our society or have begun to be realized because the centralized power structure fails to adhere to any moral edifice of sustainability, morals

To illustrate my points further about sensibility, dis-information and deception.

The bottom line here is that Controlled obsolescence and controlled obedience has been the dominant theme for a long time through various political, big businesses, some parts of the public and the majority of our leaders are not interested in curing cancer, encouraging morality, enforcing justice, healthy individuality through questioning, practicing sovereignty and sustainability; instead they have incentivized the opposite: expensive prescription medications, massive surveillance systems, speculative trading, glamorizing a nearsighted form of materialistic intelligence and vanity through comedy or arrogance on television. Basically at the very heart of it

Now all of my points were not to make you angry because it is important to remain lucid, governments, language, environment, food supplies, indigenous cultures and the people have ultimately been misled and their minds corrupted- it has happened slowly, surely and surreptitiously. In retrospect, Lincoln, Gautama Siddhartha or Gandhi
Now let’s take a practical look at our current leaders that are in power or just have stepped out not too long ago

..... That is why things are the way they are now and things will keep deteriorating under our system of valueless governance and materialistic addiction. If any future generation ever hopes to learn from our mistakes, then design, eventually it becomes self-inflicted and then onto the world to repeat across generations unless it is stopped by the same primordial moral and immaterial spiritual force.

We are all connected in this and we will have to participate in making things better again for ourselves and each other, there is nothing more important. 

Here is the wake up point then- that our actions (stemming from our arrogance) have put the whole planet at risk and that we are headed towards extinction. The positive however, their ideals and maybe even what they were suppose to stand for in the first place. It is a great thing to learn of our real identity in desperation and abandon the fake relative masks imposed on us by others with an artificial ideology stemming from excess comfort. I also want to share some simple solution here: find and stand for your values and morals! Don't stop believing in them, don't stop questioning the current state of things and keep struggling to overcome. The evil that has perpetuated will definitely undo itself because of its unsustainability but for all individuals that want to participate in good consciousness to undo this evil, then it is pretty simple: stand for your innate values and just practice them ever so slightly daily even in the current state of things. This way there is still no need for violence, extremism or anger; just the opposite is needed right now: perspective, peace and perseverance in the face of evil, corruption and injustice.

It needs to be said that the best revolutions would start internally and then spread like wildfire without even a single shot this would be the highest form of organization and human consciousness. The worst revolutions are the ones that would involve rape of women

My post might be down-voted, that something immaterial is always needed to keep society moving along. Good values, spirituality, ethics etc. are not material things so please share this post if needed. I'm not claiming to own this piece of writing; intelligence is never meant to be privatized so spread it around and claim it as your own if needed! 

TLDR: All of our problems begin because of a lack of sensibility, similarly consumer culture is the sickness because it is ultimately about keeping people narrow-minded and obedient to continue consuming. Bad leadership is responsible but the public has also refused to wake up and question things as well. Hence, unless we start with good community values and question, we are headed towards absolute crisis so it is really important to find those good values, practice them and question now more than ever before. Violent revolutions are also not the answer under this understanding and it will help avoid future injustices. Peace and good luck to all!

OK

I am from Balkan region, for 1 whole year i lived and survived in a city of 50 000- 60 000 residents WITHOUT: electricity, fuel,running water,real food distribution, or distribution of any goods, or any kind of organized law or government.

The city was surrounded for 1 year and in that city actually it was SHTF (shit hit the fan) situation.

We did not have organized army or police force, fight for his own house and his own family.

Some of us was better prepared, few owned AK-47 when all started.

Anyway,hospital looked like butchery, police force vanished, 80 percent of hospital staff gone home.

I was lucky, 3 Kalashnikov s) so we lived and survived, most of us.

I remember US Air force dropped MRE every 10 days (god bless USA for that) as help for surrounded city

After three months rumors started about first deaths from starvation, window frame from abandoned houses for heating, i burned all my own furniture for heating, lot of people died from diseases, mostly from bad water (two of my family members), we used rain water for drink, several times i ate pigeons

Money was not worth shit. We traded things, most of that women were just desperate mothers, candles, lighters,antibiotics,fuel,batteries, we fight like animals for that.

In situation like that lot of things change

Strength was in the numbers, no matter how well armed.

Anyway

It was almost 20 years ago when I was a young man, i remember everything, and i think i learned a lot.

Me and my family are prepared now

**Social status is based on resource consumption.**

The more resources you consume in our society

Your shoes look damaged, it's time you buy new ones. We don't want any gossiping. Don't wear anything second hand either, let alone things out of fashion.

You bought your first car? Well congratulations Billy, you want to be a real man.

You don't eat meat? Are you serious? Really? Well that makes you a pussy. Real men eat meat. Here

You ride a bicycle? Oh you're one of those annoying smug self-righteous people!

You bought your first house that you can't afford through a risky mortgage? Well, this will allow you to finally get married.](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-01/05/content_14386646.htm)

The biggest shame for 20-somethings now is to live with their parents,  and Western societies now having the highest percentage of single households in recorded history. All those single households have people watching TV on their own, heating for a single person as opposed to multiple, maintenance work, etcetera. It is immensely wasteful and does not occur in undeveloped countries.

If it's your first,fifth...scrap that, ANY anniversary, you HAVE to take your girlfriend out to an expensive restaurant. Otherwise her friends will think you aren't willing to invest significant resources in her any more because he ""takes her for granted"", hence humiliating her. 

If you don't go on vacation this year

Better yet than the requirement to engage in the above status enhancing rituals

If you see something useful laying by the side of the road, that are fast enough for my younger brother to play Skyrim on.

If you were willing to ignore the stigma, freegans. They eat what others throw away out of ideological convictions. People become less willing to do this kind of stuff though, because every mindless blob of fat now carries a cell phone that it uses to record any individual in its vicinity that is acting out of the ordinary.

I will be accused of sexism for saying this, and respond to it by complying and consuming things they do not really need nor desire. 

Now, but instead of consumption, social status is linked to fertility. The best thing a woman can do there to raise her social status is to have more children. Hence overpopulation doesn't really end, and the fertility rate has hardly declined in 40 years in Nigeria.

Conclusion:

If there was not a social standard that we have to consume to raise social status

However, and men who fail to consume are punished for it (as in the example of China, where men without houses can not marry). Hence we live beyond our means, and hence, we invite collapse, because we can not overcome our simple primitive instincts.",,,,

**Introduction**

The purpose of this essay is to explain the unsustainable nature of the phenomenon of Industrial civilization

**How are we borrowing from the past?**

Our way of life is mainly made possible by our ability to retrieve energy that was fixated by natural processes over a time period of millions of years

[Fossil fuels are the main source of energy used in the world today

Although it is true that many 1st world countries also use renewable energy, many forms of renewable energy are heavily dependent upon government subsidies without which they would not be affordable. People in the 1st world use non-fossil fuel in their own homes, while buying products made in the 3rd world that were until recently produced in their own countries, with fossil fuels.

Renewable energy also paradoxically increases fossil fuel use. As an example, which are most efficient when used at full power, which is not always possible due to energy sources such as wind energy.](http://davidmdelaney.com/Ferguson/Fundamental-problem-6.pdf) 

It is estimated that all oil that is globally available was produced in a time period of anywhere between 50 and 300 million years. All available oil that is commercially extractable will be used in a period of about 125 years. Hence we can reason that our current pattern of oil consumption consumes a natural resource at about a million times the rate at which it is generated.

Hence

For coal and natural gas

Considering that we are currently already using about 50% of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity, according to recent estimates. Such an EROI means that biofuels are not really a source of energy, but merely a method of energy conversion. [Considering that an EROI of 3:1 is considered required to build a civilization on](http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25), they appear to provide no hope for the future of industrial civilization, [along with Shale oil, which requires massive amounts of energy investment to retrieve, refine and distribute as well.](http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/shale-20100803.html)

All of this is important, we are starting to need increasingly larger amounts of fossil fuel. How is this possible?

There are multiple reasons for this. Many local sources of water and fertilizer and soil are being eliminated

Furthermore, hence requiring more fossil fuel use to deliver the same calories of nutrition to people.

**Other gifts from the past**

This brings us to our other gifts from the past. Not just oil, ""fossil water"", soil and guano.

We have used up Guano

A few principles are important to note here:

1. **Moving from one resource to a new resource generally increases pollution.** Pollution is a form of borrowing from the future

Pollution increases because the best and most pure sources of a resource are used first. As an example, it contains less uranium, mercury and other types of contaminants.

Similarly, which is a fancy name for bird droppings and which was used before rock phosphate, contains very little contaminants.

As another example, with the United States now using a horribly polluting method called fracking.

2. **As one resource starts to deplete it takes increasing amounts of other resources to maintain our consumption of that resource.** Consider our problem of running out of ground water in many places. We can transport water from other places, hence also increasing our fossil fuel use.

As another example, hence further increases fossil fuel demand.

We can eventually start using shale oil

Hence

&gt;""Through innovation we will find a solution to our problem.""

Historically

But now, hence leading to *their* depletion.

Consider for example the idea of building new nuclear power plants to solve our energy crisis (our real energy crisis being the fact that we are starting to need increasingly higher amounts of energy as a result of the trends described earlier). Nuclear power plants take water from a river

[Scientists predict that the increasing temperature of river water will decrease the output of our thermoelectric energy plants

Hence the construction of new nuclear power plants to ""solve"" our problem that would warm the river water further would further decrease the output of other power plants utilizing the same river.

1338946309.0,un50d,A few common misconceptions about collapse,growth_kills_nature,76,16,51,"I'd like to go over some common misconceptions I've heard many times on this subreddit and in real life.

It seems like the most common one is that [""humans are very innovative""](http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2012/02/techno-fix-why-technology-wont-save-us-or-the-environment.html). I've heard this **so many** times. It's not necessarily untrue. Yes, and we cannot invent new energy. Solar and wind are great, but they cannot save civilization. Don't get me started on [nuclear energy](http://www.realnews24.com/fukushima-reactor-no-4-vulnerable-to-catastrophic-collapse-could-unleash-85-times-cesium-137-radiation-of-chernobyl-human-civilization-on-the-brink/). They are alternatives, but not replacements. There is NO replacement for oil. Oil is the most dense, easy and rich fuel there is. 

The next misconception is that humans work together during times of crisis and Americans will escape the worst of collapse because ""our culture is different"" than the countries that are currently in a more advanced stage of collapse. [Take a look at Greece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGp2frlqbGI); riots, poverty, and rampant suicide (they went from having the lowest suicide rates in the EU to the highest). Greece was a 1st world country. We can look at many examples of other countries that have been in an advanced state of collapse for a long time now. We're not that different than them. The biggest differences is our immense, debt-driven prosperity, and American exceptionalism and arrogance, or nationalism. Take away the false wealth and you will see how we are not that different from our fellow humans around the world. The arrogance and self-entitlement of Americans and other 1st world nations [will make our collapse the worst](http://youtu.be/O30-vchHl6w). We have become a very individualistic society. Community is bascially non-existant. Many Americans can only rely on their partner and maybe one friend. We have also lost many traditions and skills. Most people don't even know how to grow food, which is something everyone will need to do.

The 3rd misconception is that people who talk about preparing for collapse and mention guns or survival strategies are sociopaths and want to live out their ""Mad Max fantasies"". This may be the most insulting misconception. Please don't shoot the messenger. Those of us who can talk about things like a die-off or having to kill another person are not sociopaths. We have just entered the last stage of greiving: acceptance. I have probably been in this stage for close to a year. Many of the newcomers and complainers about this subreddit are most likely in the denial or anger stage. They feel this subreddit is a personal attack of sorts. People get very defensive when collapse is discussed. This goes back to the arrogance and belief that we can innovate our way out of all our problems. Many people see humans as being above animals and forget that the same rules that apply to animals still apply to us. We are very smart, have evolved to focus on immediate problems. Out media and government helps this by lulling people into a false sense of security that things will get better. In order to understand collapse most people have to invest at least 10 or 20 hours of research. If you haven't don't that, you should.

Lastly, the harder they fall"", and it's true. We're approaching a tipping point. It's likely to be the next round of financial collapse that sets things off, with Europe being the [epicenter](http://cluborlov.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/fragility-and-collapse-slowly-at-first.html).

I hope I've gotten through to a few collapse-curious folks out there. If not

What happens when a director finally admits there really is no threat to our national security on a foreign level, and co-workers and their family's too. 

Does he decide to find a new problem or with the help of his friends in other departments, you know, gotta justify that budget. 

Many times I've heard the expression ""Spend what's left of that budget or they will make it smaller next time."" If you want the budget to go up for any government project you must justify why you need to spend more. Maybe it is just many men with mortgages way over their head and they must pick between themselves and you.

This would indicate another recession is upon us.  That would be consistent with recent jobs reports

By the way, so they doubled their spending on social services to prevent it.  The problem for them with low oil prices is that they now need oil to sell for at least $90/barrel in order to keep their services expenditures up.  

Another issue is the feedback cycle from dropping oil prices.  Many of the unconventional sources of oil require so much energy input that they are not feasible to extract below a certain price.  IIRC, it would only feed a downward trend.

Yes jobs aren't secure and the future looks a little bleak, and things are usually better because of it (for a while at least).  The process of collapse can be uncomfortable

I've spent most of my life studying self-reliance and survival (as I'm sure many of you have), I live in the right place, I can grow my own food, and I've learned to live without electricity should I need to.  To me, this is a hopeful thing and I feel glad that there are 18,000 others in this subreddit who recognize the need for that kind of knowledge.  It makes it better for all of us.
