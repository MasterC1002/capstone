I couple this with colour selector plugins to enable a ""live preview"" version of the site.

it is driven by data attributes

* selector: the jQuery Selector to use to apply the css setting to: defaults to the source element

* property: the css property to set: defaults to 'background-color'

* event: the jQuery event to trigger the change

* after: a call back to execute after the property(ies) are applied


anyways, or if you find this useful!

the plugin and small demo:
http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/3/

**edit: made a few small changes: http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/6/**

**edit: with your help and some bug fixes: http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/10/**

has a property ""setSourceBG"" which enables toggling the input's bg within the event (true by default)
and ""runOnInit"" which runs the script once after it is loaded to configure set any default values (true by default)

now allows multiple properties to be set on the same selector (3rd box in demo)... had to re-arrange the way the data- attributes were stored

**clarification edit**
sure

Just to clarify: it changes element css styles
in the demo

* the first input box, rgb(255,0,0), rgba(255,0,0

* 2nd box is the same
 
* 3rd box is onKeyUp, working on it)

* 4th box, and writes to the console

its just a tool to make css changes ""directly"" preview-able withouth having to write much jquery for each element

I started a prototype of the site using Knockout. And while I quickly feel in love with the two way binding

But this isn't about Knockout...

I started building out the Admin section and decided to switch gears. After doing some research I decided to give Backbone a try.
Everything was going fine. I created several sections within admin and I was pulling live data out of the database. I couldn't be happier with the way it was going.

Until I started testing Object creation
I started looking at Chromes Network monitor
When i searched the tubes I found loads of stuff about sending POST when it should have been sending PUT

I must have gone back and forth with this problem for about 3 days off and on. I must have read and re-read the router (paragraph) docs a dozen times. 
It didn't make any sense. 
Another confusing issue I saw was that creating a new model
I honestly couldn't discern where this was value coming from. At no point in my code or in Backbone

Last night I  built a sample backbone app
I sat back and looked at my code again. I knew it had to be in the router (where the EditView was being called from). but where... And then it dawned on me...
... 
""links/add"": ""addLink""
""links/:id"": ""getLink""
... 

No where else in my route config did I have those two switched. Only in the Links section.
So I switched them around aaaaaaaand it worked.

Yep. 
Route order is very important... 

Lesson learned...

Situation: CMS spits out (floating:left) DIV's with a title at the bottom, and this is reason for the div below to jump to the next row, thus, ruining my neat grid.

I turned to http://masonry.desandro.com/ and after that to 'the horizontal version' http://isotope.metafizzy.co/. I started off relaxed, is too small, all over the place, everything. Here's the 
[situation](http://www.vitter.be/sandbox).

Small detail: I actually got the desired effect for a moment

What do I have: I think (think) I'll need both Masonry &amp; Isotope

     $(window).load(function(){
            $('#tab1').masonry({
                isAnimated: true
                columnWidth: 211
                itemSelector: '.container'
            }).imagesLoaded(function() {
                    $('#content').masonry('reload');
                });
        });
    
    
     $('#tab1').isotope({
     masonryHorizontal : {
     rowHeight : 360

I first released [jquery.ellipsis](https://github.com/pboling/jquery.ellipsis) a few months ago to no fanfare

I would appreciate any advice you can give me as a relatively fresh jQuery dev

Edit: Apparently it wasn't clear to what **jquery.environment** allows you to do:

* Access global settings through `$.environment`

* Have a standard interface for accessing global settings across projects

* Have a standard way to set environment settings in javascript based on server side code (when the DOM is generated server-side)

    `&lt;body data-environment-configuration=""{verbose: 'true'}""&gt;)`

    then later...

    `if ($('body').environment('verbose' == 'true')) {log_something};`

* Make it clear that information is a global setting

A few questions:

1. I've noticed that the official jQuery plugins site is... erm... not exactly... so where do you all go to find the latest hot jQuery open source.  Is there a jQuery equivalent of RubyGems.org?

2. Did I commit any javascript or jQuery sins in my first two plugins?  Please let me know as I would like to avoid them in my next one [jquery.cacheableFlash](https://github.com/pboling/jquery.cacheableFlash).

I am trying to change the speed of the ball on the fly using the faster/slower buttons. This used to remove the current CSS animation style (with the old speed), but I thought it was better suited than using classes as I am dynamically changing the animation speed constantly.


    function animate(x
        $('#xSpeed').html(x);
        $('#ySpeed').html(y);

        var horizontalCSS = 'updown ' + y + 's infinite linear';
        var ballCSS = 'leftright ' + x + 's infinite linear';

        $('#horizontal')
            .css('-webkit-animation'
            .css('-moz-animation'
            .css('animation'

            .css('-webkit-animation'
            .css('-moz-animation'
            .css('animation'
    }

This works as expected in Firefox (albeit slightly jittery, and in IE 10 the ball animation works, but there is no speed change at all, even when leaving/returning to the tab or in real time.

I think the issue is that the animation style is being appended to #horizontal, as I want to have other elements moving alongside the ball at the same speed, all moving within 'horizontal'. However, it seems that the child element is not being updated property e.g. until I leave the tab and return. In chrome if I use 'Inspect Element' to inspect the ball directly, the div outline which appears when hovering over the code for #ball is moving independently of the ball on screen!

A client of mine wanted an image to fadeIn when the page loaded. No prob right? I've done this before using this rough script wrapped in the normal $(document).ready():  
  
    $(mySelector).bind('load'
        $(mySelector).hide();  
        $(mySelector).fadeIn(3000);  
    })  
  
Worked in chrome, ie7-8 but not ie9. Weird.  
The .load(function()) wouldn't work in ie9 either.  
  
After staring at the wall for a bit
  
    $(mySelector).ready(function(){  
        $(mySelector).hide();  
        $(mySelector).fadeIn(3000);  
    })  
  
And that worked across the board. What's going on? Is there a bug with .bind('load'

(This is where my script comes in.)

The data is put into a table, that entire bit of -adding- a row is perfect. But deleting (we'll hold off on editing, for now.)...

That's where my problem lies.

Let's assume you input 50 new lines of data into this table, from the 1st to the 49th entry can be deleted. Except, however, the very last one. I have an idea of why this is, but I don't know how to fix it.

Here is my code:

    $(document).ready(function(){
    
    //Creation of new Row
    	var tbody = $(""#log"");
    	$('#submit').on('click'
    		tbody.append(""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + $('#customer').val() + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + $('#project').val() + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + $('#numberhours').val() + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"" + $('#descriptionbar').val() + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;btn class='btn btn-small' id='edit'&gt;Edit&lt;/btn&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;btn class='btn btn-small' id='delete'&gt;Delete&lt;/btn&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"")
    //Deletion of Line
    		$('#delete').on('click'
    			$(this).parent().parent().remove();
    		});
    	});
    });            
I feel as if the reason that only the last row can be deleted is that the row suddenly becomes attached to the 'Submit' button, is the delete button able to be hit. After a new row is submitted, I think, it becomes unlinked, somehow, from the submit button, and is disabled.

However

To clarify

So I use jQuery UI tabs and I get content from an ajax page. I have also added the delegation of links to load them in the tab. When I click a couple of link in there, so if I execute some JavaScript that is present in the ajax page, it gets executed several times. Is there a way to ""unload"" the JavaScript easily? I think I can use iframes but it's not a very clean solution, I'm pretty sure there's a best practice somehow, but I don't know what to look for. Please note that I'm a self learner and I have no degree in programming whatsoever, I just enjoy it. Thank you in advance for your help.
So here's the main page

      $(""#itemTabs"").tabs({
       load: function(event

      }
     });

In one of the tab, I've got more javascript/jquery. So the code inside the ajax page is getting executed everytime I click on a link. For example, the following code returns several popups ""Are you sure?""

Hi

I'm working on a game, with values ""attack"", ""skill"", and ""item"") determining whether you want to attack, use a skill, or use an item; and there's a select for which skill you want to use (named ""skill""), if you're using a skill; and there's a select for which item you want to use

    ( )  Attack

    ( )  Use skill:  [ Select a skill ]

    ( )  Use item:  [ Select an item ]

So, and the same for the item dropdown. Essentially, I don't want people to have to select something from the menu *and* click the radio button, in part because that's slightly more of a pain and in part because due to the way the script needs to be set up it'll fail to work if you don't remember, and you'll end up just attacking (which is obviously not what you wanted to do, and frustrating).

I've tried looking into how I can use jQuery to update the radio buttons with an onclick or onchange for the selects, as apparently I'm too dumb to figure this out.)

2. When a user clicks on one of the small images, if I clicked on a smaller image [it would become this.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3098576/site3%205.jpg)

I have a script that looks at a page's element to determine the chosen language. Based on that choice

It's running on Zendesk

Here's the script: [http://pastebin.com/h8GCTjMB](http://pastebin.com/h8GCTjMB)

I'm using the bind('load') so that the scripts don't run until the page finishes rendering and generating variables. It won't work otherwise (no ID/class for the target element(s)). 

$language and $generatedAlt always get set properly, but I don't see the effects in the html.

Does anyone see a reason why this should work ~80% of the time and fail every once in a while? It also seems like the initial page visit under a certain language messes up.

    &lt;a href=""download.php?id=5""&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;

And then on download.php I would query the database with something like:

    UPDATE projects SET downloads=theCurrentNumberOfDownloadsPlusOne WHERE id=$_GET['id']

(obvious after escaping/stripping slashes etc)

Instead, and it tells download.php to update the download count, then redirects the user to the file? (all without changing the page)

I know I'll have to use AJAX to submit the request
 [this tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/submit-a-form-without-page-refresh-using-jquery/) for that

Thanks for any help
    

**EDIT:** I think my phrasing was a little off. In the mean time

    function download(id
		    var newdown = downloads+1;
		    var set = 'projectid='+id+'&amp;downloads='+newdown;
		    $.ajax({  
      type: ""POST""
      url: ""bin/process.php""
      data: set
      success: function() {
    	    alert(""Done: projectid=""+id+"" new downloads=""+newdown);
      }  
    });  
    return false;  
    }

Everytime I echo a new ""Project"" from the database

(php)

    echo ""&lt;a onclick='download("".$row['id'].""

So when you click the link

It adds one download

    $id = $_POST['projectid'];
    $downloads = $_POST['downloads'];

    $query = ""UPDATE projects SET downloads=:downloads WHERE id=:id"";
    $stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare($query);
    $stmt-&gt;execute(array("":downloads"" =&gt; $downloads

Now

[Also, won't it just trigger a download for some_file.zip and keep me on /index.php?

[And, and I'd prefer to use a JavaScript/jQuery redirerect rather than HTTP.

Here's some sample code

    function loadPhotos(plantcode) {

       loadPhotos(plantcode);
    }  

In this case, the delay isn't long enough and it fails.

resetImages() is called via a button press or whatever.

So how can I get the .getScript() call to wait until the earlier .append() call is complete?  Is using setTimeout() really the best workaround?  And if so

1370277738.0,1fl8bq,Having an issue with a autocomplete plugin.,devroth,2,0,2,"Hi guys

I'm having an issue with an autocorrect plugin at work right now and figured I'd give this subreddit a try. I'll post the markup and error message I'm getting.

Here's the jQuery that does the magic.

		$('.contactName').autocomplete({
			maxCacheLength:1
			useCache:false
			url: '../czolgosz/php/controller/autocomplete_source.php?type=contacts&amp;l=15'
			showResult: function(value
				return value;	
			}
			onItemSelect: function(item) {
				validContact = true;
				var selectedContactID = item.data;
				$('input[name=ContactID]').val(selectedContactID);
			}
		});
    
Now here's an example of what that webservice returns.


    Phil Bunnell at The Promo Deli|67481
    Phil Stumpf at American Solutions For Business|67642
    YOLANDA PHILLIPS at PHILCO INTERNATIONAL|67942
    Philip McDonald at Magnified Promotions Inc.|68063
    Phillip Simson at Capital Promotion Partners|68077    

So how it works is when you type the plugin calls the web service

Here's the error when the plugin fires.

    Uncaught TypeError: Property 'source' of object [object Object] is not a function jquery-ui.min.js:5
    e.widget._search jquery-ui.min.js:5

I got this book ""Building iPhone Apps"" by Jonathan Stark and tried to use some code from its 3rd chapter which didn't quite work out.  
So what I'm trying to accomplish is loading html from one site into another(d'oh). I want to have one index.html which loads it's contents from other .html
So my basic html goes like this:
  
  
(index.html)
      &lt;body&gt;   
      &lt;div id=""nav""&gt;   
      &lt;a href=""link1.html""&gt;link1&lt;/a&gt;   
      &lt;a href=""link2.html""&gt;link2&lt;/a&gt;   
      &lt;/div&gt;   
      &lt;div id=""container""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   
      &lt;/body&gt; 
  
    

(somecontent.html)   
    &lt;body&gt;   
      &lt;div id=""content""&gt;*read some html content
      &lt;/body&gt;   

OK

      $(document).ready(function(){   
      	loadPage();   
      	hijackLinks();   
      });
   
      function loadPage(url) {   
      	if(url == undefined) {   
   		$('#container').load('hello.html #content'
		
      	} else {   
	   	
   		   $('#container').load(url + ' #content'
		
	
      	}   
      }


      function hijackLinks() {   
   	   $('body a').click(function(e){   
      		e.preventDefault();   
      		loadPage(e.target.href);   
      	});   
      }   

The problem is I get no response when clicking on a link at all
What am I doing wrong? Maybe someone could provide me with some insight here.. also: what's a good site to search for ajax input which could help me further on this topic?

My first attempt was to pass a timestamp through an ajax request and prepend a table with the returned html table rows. I did get this feature working but in my short bout of testing I found it unreliable on anything quicker than 30 seconds. I've attached the first attempt to give an understanding of what I'm trying to do. 

Here's what I have: 

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
      function geteldata(eltimestamp) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""eventlog/eldata?elstr=""+eltimestamp

            $(html).prependTo('#eventlog'); 
          }
        });
      }
      function getneweldata(eltimestamp) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""eventlog/eldata?elstr=""+eltimestamp
          cache: false
          success: function(html){
            $(html).hide().prependTo('#eventlog').fadeIn(2500); 
          }
        });
      }
      $(document).ready(function() {
        var eltimestamp = jQuery.now();
        geteldata(eltimestamp);
        setInterval(function(){ getneweldata(eltimestamp); eltimestamp = jQuery.now(); }
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;table id=""eventlog"" cellpadding=""5"" cellspacing=""0"" border=""1"" align=""center"" width=""100%""&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;

        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

The ""eldata"" document returns new data in this form and prepends it to the table: 

    &lt;tr id=""elid1""&gt;&lt;td&gt;May 15

The next idea was to pass the databases row id through the returned html table row selector and use the highest value to check against the new data. This

I'm working on a project for work and am running into issues figuring out how best to handle a clients request.

Here's what I'm looking at:
http://puu.sh/40eZL.png

Given the above picture

Issues I'm running into

- The images need to be smaller to the left / right
- The images need to ""slide"" left/right
- The center image (whichever food happens to be slid to the middle position) actually has a different image src than the rest; whichever one is in the middle has an ""active"" image which gives it a white outline as you can see by the picture.

So I need to make this selection slider from scratch and don't even know where to begin given the constraints listed above.

**NOTE:** I've looked at a dozen 'jQuery slider' plugins - even ones with the mac-like ""dock"" effect (elements not in the middle are smaller) - but none allow me to do position the elements like they are in the above picture (in an every-so-slight curve downwards towards the middle). 

Also none of them allow me to ""detect which image is the middle image"" so I can't change its src attribute to the active version of the food image.

Stuck and hoping some JavaScript ninja out there would be willing to help me / point me in the right direction

I thought perhaps event.currenttarget would give me the value; however

Any idea how I can do this w/o using the default dialog buttons?

Here is the dialog initialization code I'm working with:

          $( ""#confirmLightbox"" ).dialog({
      	  	autoOpen: false
      		modal: true
      		dialogClass: 'popupModal'

    		resizable: false
    		beforeClose: function( event
    			if(event.currentTarget == 'confirm') {
    				var optId = $lightbox.data('id');
    				$(""[id$=""+id+""]"").addClass(""selected"");				
    			}
    		}
    		title: 'Requires Approval'
      		 open: function(event
      			var $lightbox = $(""#confirmLightbox"");
      			$('#confirmLightbox').find('#variable').text($lightbox.data('desc'));
      		 }});  

EDIT: Here is the html for the dialog:

    &lt;div id=""confirmLightbox""&gt;
    	&lt;div&gt;
    		&lt;div id=""desc""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    		&lt;p&gt; &lt;span id=""variable""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have a simple test case for a selector I want to write. I have a button with specific text on it and I want to only select input elements of type button where the text = 'test' for this scenario. I wrote:

1337997826.0,u5fd0,[help] unexpected behaviour from moving div via .removeClass and .addClass,inthrees,1,0,2,"**SOLVED** - Turns out a different function was conflicting with this little flipper function and setting right: 0px behind this one's removal of same.

The background: position: relative; container holds a vimeo iframe and two absolutely positioned divs - one is for subtitles and the other is a nav panel that is top:0 right:0 via css class.

Originally I attempted to use .css to change the values of right to 'auto', 'inherit', etc, and the left to 5, and vice-versa, to make a simple click toggle to move the navpanel from the right side to the left side, or vice-versa.

Unsetting a position property seems to not be possible, conveniently called .right or .left.

So it works now

**But here is the problem:**

The div containing the nav elements has an rgba(0,0.3) property to help contrast the elements from the video behind it.

The problem is I'm having is the website is on www.domain.com and the webservice is on service.domain.com. This is causing all sorts of cross domain problems. Just use a JSONP callback? I have for the other webservice calls but this form includes a comment box which means I cant use GET and have to use POST (so JSONP is out). 

I did the usual googling and came across a cross domain iFrame solution. Seems to do the trick. (Create a blank iframe

    crossDomainPost : function(urlValue
    // Add the iframe with a unique name
        $variables.urlValue = urlValue;
        var returnData = ''
            name: 'mtfPostFrame'
            id:   'mtfPostFrame' 
        }).appendTo('body');
    $(iframe).css({'display' : 'none'});
    		
    var crossForm = $('&lt; form /&gt;'
        id : 'trickPostForm'
        target : 'mtfPostFrame'
        action : $variables.urlValue
        method : ""POST""
    });
    		
    $(crossForm).appendTo('body');
    		
    $(""#trickPostForm"").live('submit'
        $.ajax({
            type: 'POST'
            url: $variables.urlValue
            success: function(data) {
                return false;
            }
             error:  function(t
               alert(""Apologies there was an error with your submission"");
            }

        });
        return false;
    });
    		
    $(""#trickPostForm"").submit();
    
    }

This solution works perfectly in Firefox, the server sends back a response (which is a set of JSON results, which isn't needed by the website) this is picked up by the browser and it offers the user a dialog to download it - which is the problem.

I tried adding a     return false to stop that behaviour but that ends up stopping the form submission all together.

var i;

      var myListArray = new Array();
      myListArray[0] = ""CONSULTANCY"";
      myListArray[1] = ""INTERACTIVE"";
      myListArray[2] = ""LIVE EVENTS"";

The menu will have to do:

have the 5th item in the list as the active button
have the list be able to be reordered so the clicked button is now the 5th item in the menu.
