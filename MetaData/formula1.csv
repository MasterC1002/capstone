After deleting some entries because they were really REALLY obvious trolls or because there were problems with the entry

---**AGE**

The **average age of the people who took the survey is 24**. There was a **range of ages from 13 to 89**. Yes

Here's the data: http://i.imgur.com/XnTPi.png | http://i.imgur.com/7tg7B.png

---**COUNTRIES OF USERS**

Unsurprisingly

Here's the data: http://i.imgur.com/HoFXf.png


---**SEASONS WATCHED**

I was honestly expecting an average of anywhere from 2-5 seasons. It turns out that **people here on average have watched 7.969 seasons of F1. Or 8 seasons rounded up.** The number of seasons watched ranges from 0-45 seasons. There were 22 (1.06%) people in the survey who have watched 30+ seasons. There were 166 (8.04%) people in the survey who have watched 20+ seasons. There were 722 (35%) people in the survey who have watched 10+ seasons. This also means that 1340 (65%) of you have watched less than 10 seasons. 

http://i.imgur.com/dKd0t.png | http://i.imgur.com/yCBQw.png


---**FAVORITE TEAM**
McLaren are by far the most popular team with 29% (600) of the vote. HRT are the least favorite with only 2 votes. 15% (301) don’t have a favorite team. Here’s a table showing the favorite to least favorite.

http://i.imgur.com/Dz0BG.png


---**FAVORITE DRIVER**

This isn't going to be completely accurate as **I had forgot to put Heikki Kovalainen in this list.** I feel terrible and I'm surprised I missed it. I'm also surprised no one had noticed until 1900+ responses in. I'm not what that says about Heikki's popularity or about Reddit's observation skills. Anyways

**Kimi Raikkonen is unsurprisingly the most popular driver with 501 (24%) of the votes.** Three drivers have no favorites

The list excludes drivers who never qualified or successfully started a race (well, but solely reflect the order in the table (more 1st places, 4th etc.)*

**From the top: race wins**

The worst driver to ever win a Formula One championship race, or winner-loser-winner) took his only F1 race victory at the 1971 Italian Grand Prix, in [one of the closest finishes in the history of the sport](http://imgur.com/mGXXd0f) - and is Peter Gethin. Apart from his Monza slipstream win, his best result in F1 was a couple of 6th places among his 10 classified finishes out of 31 race entries.

The best driver who never won a race, 0-3-8)](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/12xl1w/chris_amon_leading_jackie_ickx_in_ferrari_31268s/), [Martin Brundle](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/10snuv/martin_brundle_driving_the_wheels_off_a_benetton/), [Eddie Cheever](http://imgur.com/smsiXlU) and [Jean Behra](http://imgur.com/Cu9lYlY) (all on 0-2-7 tally).

**Fast but not furious: pole positions**

The only driver who sat on F1 pole, with his [2010 pole in Brazil](http://imgur.com/C7tFDzx). His best race result is [a single 4th place](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/1do5mf/nico_hulkenberg_force_india_vjm05/). Among other drivers avoiding podiums while accepting pole positions, there are: [Bruno Giacomelli (1 pole, 0-0-1 on podiums)](http://imgur.com/ODYpq89), [Stuart Lewis-Evans (2 poles, 0-0-2)](http://imgur.com/npEv1iO), [Teo Fabi (3 poles, [Tom Pryce (1 pole, but from only 7 entries and 6 race starts) and the merry trio of Jo Bonnier

The best driver without a pole position to his name is Bruce McLaren, and not that closely by [Peter Collins](http://imgur.com/ZcYKNYo) (3-3-3) and [Johnny Herbert](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/1amq4k/johnny_herbert_benetton_b195_1995_italian_gp/) (3-1-3).

**Every step counts: podiums**

The least impressive career record out of all drivers who stood on F1 podiums belongs to Tiago Monteiro with his [3rd place at the infamous 2005 United States Grand Prix](http://imgur.com/S1rsWlB). His best result of a full-grid race was [a single 8th place](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/1980pr/tiago_monteiro_jordan_ej15b_2005_belgian_gp/). And if it weren't for those meddling ~~kids~~ Michelin tyres, [Louis Chiron](http://imgur.com/nTXwnHE), Ron Flockhart and [Lucien Bianchi](http://imgur.com/LqPnCSL) (both once on 3rd with two 6th places to support that). John Love came close to Monteiro's record, as his best result outside of his single F1 podium ([a second place in the 1967 South African GP](http://imgur.com/AjdQ6U3)) was a couple of 8th places, followed by Nicola Larini ([a single 2nd at Imola in 1994](http://imgur.com/FzfQosu) + [a single 6th](http://imgur.com/jLrLS2t) in nearly 50 races). But the standing out star of this category is Dorino Serafini - he managed to score [a second place in his only race entry, sharing a drive with Alberto Ascari at the 1950 Italian GP](http://imgur.com/H11SJUO). The man knew how to end a career on a high note.

There are five drivers who came oh, but never managed to make that crucial step for champagne. These are: [Roberto Mieres](http://imgur.com/EyEjxgT) (3-2-2 tally outside the podium), [Karl Wendlinger](http://imgur.com/82o6uev) (3-1-3), [Hector Rebaque](http://imgur.com/gtGGWkW) (3-1-2), [Christian Fittipaldi](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/13w0nb/christian_fittipaldi_pierluigi_martini_minardi/) (3-1-1) and [Arturo Merzario](http://imgur.com/GzJWSlg) (3-0-2). And while looking at that part of the all-time table (and Fittipaldi's Monza flip), one has to notice the impressive race record of Pierluigi Martini, as it took him 124 race entries (and 119 starts) to score merely two 4th places and four 5th's and 6th's each.

**Into single digits: top 10**

The most successful driver to never be classified inside the top ten is [Anthony Davidson](http://imgur.com/dqCNAtm) - three 11th places are all there was for him. But an honorable mention here must go to India's finest Narain Karthikeyan. Apart from his [4th place at the Indianapolis Michelin Service-station](http://imgur.com/Gh6DvQN), who finished at least one race on every position from [1st](http://imgur.com/7hjmtAX) all the way back to [21st](http://imgur.com/vaYpUH5).

**Shit adds up at the bottom: the backmarkers**

Out of 637 drivers, and 19 further - from their only race start, having other unsuccessful qualifying/starting attempts. But don't let the statistics fool you. Among those drivers, there most certainly are names you've already heard. [Paul Pietsch](http://8w.forix.com/pietsch.html), the first Grand Prix driver to reach the age of 100. As a contrast, he shares the list with Roger Williamson and Ricardo Paletti, both taken away from the sport way too early. [Teenage sensation Mike Thackwell](http://8w.forix.com/thackwell.html). Sports car superstar Stephane Sarrazin. [Markus Winkelhock, Jackie's elder brother. Indianapolis 500 legend Bobby Unser. [Al Pease](http://www.reddit.com/r/F1Porn/comments/199c5m/the_legendary_al_pease_eagle_mk1_1968_canadian/)

But the most bizzare of them all, yet very popular for his personality touring car driver from Germany, apart from his rather unusual Le Mans 24h record (failed to finish all of his 12 entries from 1972 to 1986, and in 1973 even twice, having driven two different Ford Capris) with names such as Patrese, Ghinzani or Alboreto as co-drivers, has one of the craziest F1 careers that defies any classification. He entered the [1977 German GP as a second entry for the ATS team, it wasn't much of a surprise to see him not qualifying for the race. But Heyer didn't settle for the Coubertinesque ""participation is more important than results"" motto and decided to enter the race anyway! He managed to score 9 laps of the Hockenheim circuit and retire due to a transmission failure - all before the officials managed to disqualify him from the race. Needless to say, and his only entry.",t5_2qimj

Michael Schumacher tested Ferrari on Mugello’s track in September 2000. Sauber was also allowed to participate in the same test because it was Ferrari’s engine-customer.

They still remember in F1-circles how Schumacher wondered over Sauber’s pace. He had no idea about who was driving the car but he decided to go and take a look. Schumacher was very surprised when hearing that there’s a young Finn driving the Sauber-car

Sauber's test driver Pedro Diniz had been driving in an F1 car since 1995. Diniz completed 71 laps at Mugello clocking his fastest time of 1:27.654 in the Sauber car.


Sauber told Kimi that they would be happy if he manages to get 1 or 2 seconds behind Pedro.

On the first day of his test

There is no previous example of other F1 drivers who have managed to get in a real F1 car with such a little experience and being so quickly.


After the test, which was in doubt.

##Kimi's super licence:

There were plenty of concerns from the FIA

After a lot of discussions between the FIA and Peter Sauber


##Melbourne 2001: Raikkonen makes his debut in Formula 1

Raikkonen seemed genuinely oblivious to the furore surrounding his arrival in the F1 paddock at Melbourne. He qualified 13th but any suggestion that such a worthy midfield performance might create perhaps a hint of pressure was immediately dispelled on race day moments before the cars were due to leave the garage. With just over 30 minutes remaining before the start, hype and speculation. As the engineers and mechanics controlled their nerves while preparing for their first proper test of the year, Raikkonen was nowhere to be seen. His engineer eventually found him, dozing gently in a room at the back of the garage. Raikkonen disturbed his sleep to go motor racing for 84 minutes, finish sixth, score a point first time out and then wonder what all the fuss was about.


##Season 2001

Raikkonen had a solid debut year


##Season 2002 and beyond

At the time, he managed to sign Kimi on the team for 2002 and beyond. 


The rest is history.

(pic and videos),punchedup,276,36,44,"tldr: I showed up at an invite only Red Bull press conference (uninvited) and got to meet Sebastian Vettel and take a lap around the future New Jersey Formula 1 track with him.

(Forgive my giggling in the videos)

http://i.imgur.com/F7Zby.jpg

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy_FsJUguI&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvsOSQ9bN_0&amp;feature=related

(this video has audio problems but it shows the whole event and the interview at the end)


I heard Red Bull was running a little PR event in North Jersey to show off the future track and have a small press conference. I expected to stand behind some velvet ropes and watch Seb answer some questions and go home but I got a surprise I never expected.

Red Bull had a few Infiniti G coupes lined up between some cop cars on what will be part of the future track. The event was invite only but a small crowd of fans and passers-by formed and Red Bulls security kept us a few hundred feet away from the action. Basically, and upon return stood outside of the cars for quick interviews and photo ops before doing it all again.

We spectators couldn't see anything from where we were positioned and most of us resigned to the fact we probably wouldn't get to meet Sebastian let alone get a picture or drive the course with him. So I decided to take a chance.

I sidled around the back of the mass of reporters surrounding the procession of cars as they came back in from a lap and made my way up to the front of the pack. From here I could see Seb and listen to the interviews he was doing and I snapped a few pictures and I was happy. 

But then the unexpected part happened. I was standing next to the lead cop car and as some bigshot went to get into the back seat he bumped into me. He apologized and said

We sped off around the course averaging 75 MPH. The cop driving the car I was in really got into it. The course was supposed to be ""closed"", and cars alike. In the rearview, Sebastian had his Infiniti G-Coupe sideways through every turn. The whole experience was surreal. I didn't think about taking video until halfway through the lap and I have a shitty camera phone but as you can see it was pretty exciting.

Afterwards I asked the guy with the clipboard if he could introduce me to Seb. He took me over to where Seb was doing an interview and literally grabbed Seb by the shoulder away from the interview brought him to me where I shook his hand and snapped a shot. There was no time to talk to him or anything because as soon as the shutter snapped he said he had to go and jumped back in his car. I walked back to where the rest of the spectators were standing and for a few minutes I was the most envied fan in Formula 1.

As some of you may be aware, but when I *do* take issue with authors more concerned with quantity over quality.

Now I hate to make this thread ""political""

I would write a whole huge thing about this

I want to get a picture as to whether or not /r/formula1 would like for me to continue announcing my streams here.

##Back to Business##

Because the stream unceremoniously went down before it finished last time

Hopefully my internet stays up this time!  :|

**IRC:** [#f1 on irc.snoonet.org](http://webchat.snoonet.org/?channels=f1)

If you're having any technical issues, *be patient*!  People idle in IRC channels all the time, and there's almost always somebody there--probably just busy at that very moment.

**Stream:** http://veetle.com/v/50695b6729269

Even though my DVR records 1 hr additional after the race

0. I've been watching SpeedTV's coverage for about 13 years and I thought it was *great* coverage...
1. OMG WTF.  BBC coverage is like F1 porn to me.  I almost O faced when I realized you have a WHOLE HOUR pre-race show (30 min in the US).
2. YOU DON'T HAVE ADS... HOLY CRAP.  I get to see sooooo much more of the race.  Usually fast forwarding through commercials
3. You aired yourselves driving around in a golf cart w/ Schumi and Vettle.  WTF - I didn't even know things like that existed?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?
4. You had a LONG interview w/ Martin Whitmarsh where he actually wasn't just trying to get off camera.  You could talk to him and ask questions... SINCE WHEN DID THIS THING HAPPEN?!?!?!
5. You got Martin AGAIN after the podium... WHAT?!???!?!!  Is this common?  SpeedTV goes straight to commercial
6. You were in pit lane doing your broadcast... WTF - I didn't know they allowed that???  We got to hear raw noise from the cars... ear porn.
7. Did I mention there were no ads?  It's SOOOOOOO much different watching the race w/out interruption.
8. I got to see drivers walking the track while you drove by them... WOAH - I didn't even know cameras were allowed there.
9. You have like 20 hosts.  You have time to give each one air time. WTF
10. You had Vettle drive around one of your hosts in a street car.  WHAT?!  I didn't know things like that even existed.
11. Your grid reporter actually was given air time to get good interviews. W T F. Is this normal?  usually we get 3-4
12. You spend like 15 minutes of air time just warming us up for the race (driver's walking into the track, etc).  It was like foreplay.
13. I got to see more of the behind-the-scenes 'stuff' just by looking in the background of the camera shots during the pre-race show than I've ever seen.
14. OMG THIS IS AWESOME
15. You side-by-side comparison of 2 cars going through the lap to point out who was slower and where - HOLY CRAP - that is COOL.
16. You hosts didn't repeat the same stuff throughout the race (or atleast I'm just not used to them yet).

**Is this what F1 coverage is like around the world?  Do they really put that much effort into the show each race?**




I think I'm going to have to download every race instead of watching the DVR'd version from now on... I just bought a Western Digital Media player just so I can play it on my TV w/ surround sound.

I had always known that my grandfather had some relationship to Formula 1 (I knew he was a very high up ford engineer, and then found pictures of him with the likes of Colin Chapman, Graham Hill and Jim Clark all over the internet. Quite a cool realization, unfortunately since my father has passed, the available information is quite lacking. Curse me for not having the same interested 15 years ago. 

After I told my mom how I was reading all of this, just thought I would share.
