Make-up can occasionally be nice, I want to kiss that little wrinkle by someone's cheek that tweaks a smile into a little self-confident smirt. I want to see those cute little freckles and play a little game of connect the dots in my head.

I am 22, I decided to go natural in a general move towards trying to live a healthier lifestyle. Things started off fine- I had weeks when my skin was noticeably clearer, less dry, etc. However, about two months ago, my skin started getting worse.

To account for all changes I have made and describe how I presently treat my skin care: I wash my face twice a day; once in the shower in the morning, though, so I changed soaps about four months ago. I have been using soaps from Lush Cosmetics since then. For the first two months of my using them, my skin showed some minor improvement from the step up it had already gotten to. I added occasional uses (about once a week for a month) of Lush's Mask of Magnaminty to my skin care as well, and when I do use it, it seems to help for a few days. I have been using Aveeno's Eczema Therapy lotion on my skin (face included) for a year now. I tried to stop using it for a month (that test ended about two weeks ago), but the only difference that made was, that my skin got drier. I use witch hazel to tone my skin every few days (no set schedule there) after washing my face at night.

Part of the problem which has come up is that I have more whiteheads now than I have ever had before. The vast majority of them are tiny

I'm looking for an affordable dermatologist in my area, and this seemed to be a good place to do it. If there is perhaps a better place for me to ask, a pointer would be very much appreciated.

Anyway, and the time is quite late over here, but all of you are beautiful. And yes, I know it sounds like a clichée or a poor attempt to bone someone over the interweb, but really. I see your pictures, and I get sad that more aren't aware of how their imperfections are the thing that makes them stand out. 

Out of the blue I recall a line from a poem by Scott Fitzgerald.

*""Sculptures of perfect imperfections""* 

I had a girlfriend who snored in her sleep. Horrible huh? But thats one of the things I liked most about her. When I laid next to her, liked **me** so much, that she dared bare herself to me. That feeling of acceptance, it was such a mental turn on, that subtle warm feeling inside of me. 

Laying there next morning, that make her, her. Wow. 

So yea, and that I applaud you for ignoring that stupid little voice back in the head that tries to hold you back from realizing that all of you, every single one *are beautiful.* ",,False,self,t5_2sdqx,,http://www.reddit.com/r/gonenatural/comments/1e1crx/to_the_people_of_gonenatural/
