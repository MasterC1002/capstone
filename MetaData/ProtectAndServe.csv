1361124901.0,18p88j,"I was asked not too long ago ""What makes a good police officer?"" by someone wanting to go into Law Enforcement.",10-13,208,36,62,"Some good tips are simple: stay in shape


However


1) **Knowledge is complete power with this job.** I pride myself on knowing the laws of my city back and front, be more careful, and don't let me catch him doing whatever he was doing again.


2) **Have discretion... don't be a supercop.** Where I work there are over 8 million people residing. There is no need to write every single person. Arrests are different - if someone is breaking a law that is an automatic arrest


3) **Treat people with respect**, unless of course they are doing something that warrants them not respectable (fighting with the police, spitting at us, you get the idea). Do this because you may not remember all of the people you arrest, but they will remember you. When you're out at the park with your family they will see you. You won't see them. Will they attack you because you tortured them for hours before they were sent to bookings? Or will they simply ignore it and keep walking? That choice is yours to make.



4) **Get a hobby.** Your entire life cannot be police work or you will go insane. I play a lot of video games in my free time because it relaxes me and keeps me happy when I need a pickup. If you eat


5) **Be yourself and don't change for the worse.** You're going to change... you are going to start being more aware of your surroundings. You will always face the door when you are out eating to see who is coming in and what is going on. You'll always be cautious. It's okay, because I can talk to them about stress and problems with the job and they will understand. But sometimes you don't want to talk about work, so I have another set of old friends that I see as well that keep me level.


6) **Don't forget what it was like before you were a cop.** It was scary seeing a police car behind you. It was scary when cops approached you on the street. It scares people. You can be the nicest cop in the world


7) **Keep your body and your mind sharp.** Run a few times a week... stay active. Join a baseball league and play on your days off for an hour or two. Just keep yourself in shape and you will be a lot happier on this job. I came on the job horribly out of shape after 4 years of college - beer and wings did it in for me. I started running


8) **Learn to talk to people.** They are people, they are the residents. Let them voice their concerns, and allow yourself to listen. Don't ever think you are better than someone just because you are an officer. If someone is indeed a piece of shit (and you will encounter a LOT of these people) let it be because they are that way that you act the way you do towards them. But if someone is coming to you for help, treat them as a person - not as a statistic.


9) **Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.** If someone needs to be put down because they are causing harm to you or someone else, pull the trigger. We need to be able to make those hard choices. It isn't easy to live with, but you are the only person who is going to make that choice. You're an officer, not a civilian any more. You're not a hero until you do something heroic. Be brave - when the gunshots go off and everyone is running away, you're the one that has to run towards them. 

10) Finally, but overall your job is to protect them - even if that means protecting them from themselves. Don't ever think that someone who is calling you for help with their problems doesn't matter, because after responding to the same type of job 1,000,000 times it may not mean much to you - but it is the end of the world for them. Have compassion.

We had an employee buzz in at the gatehouse at 3:15 A.M. which makes my supervisor and my self wonder who is coming in and what he is doing here at 3 in the morning (You have to have special permission to come in after hours.)

I walked out to meet the employee inside the fenced parking lot to see what was going on and after talking to him for a few moments outside of his car when he reaches inside his jacket and pulls out a .45 handgun and starts screaming about how the company unjustly fired him and they were ripping him off.

I try to calm him down as much as I can with out aggravating the situation anymore. He stops for a second and looks right at me and pulls the trigger. Thankfully I hear the loudest click I have ever heard in the world as the weapon misfires.

Signing that cardboard put a grin on my face just as big as the boy's. I passed it to my partners who also added their autographs and handed it back to him.

Honestly, and I respect that, but most of you come here with an open mind and just want to talk about what is happening in the world of police. That is what this subreddit was made for in the first place: discussion on topics from both sides.

Hello everyone!

So, an anti-police (or at least police-critical) subreddit, when a post of an officer concering citizens filming cops was linked there.

In the wake of this

As such

Things that are **NOT** to report:

- Posts disagreeing with you. This should be obvious. Just because someone doesn't agree with you
- People hurting your feelings. Yeah

Things that are to report:

- Racism. This should be obvious.
- Posts like ""Fuck you pig
- Other sick and weird shit

User jediphobic has made a good point: If you you see something borderline

Unlike what our friends at B_C_N_D want to make you believe, from 10 minutes ago. The lowest entry is when the whole shitstorm started.

As you can see

**Examples of deleted posts:**

""You pussy fucking pig. I hope some nigger shoots you through the car door. ""But his tail light was out!!"" yeah... tell it to your next of kin.""

""I didn't say ""black"" I said nigger. There's a huge difference between black men and niggers.
I would hope that nigger got shot waddling his fat ass out of Popeyes.""

""You're almost completely full of shit. I hope Dorner kills as many of you fuckers as possible.""

Eventually, brewed a pot of coffee to offer in case the officers came inside, and prepared myself to explain the situation. They arrived with their lights off and parked at the bottom of my rather long driveway, and stayed there a while. I put on all of the house and porch lights and walked to the window and kept waiting. Eventually, I went outside and saw four state police with AR-15s (which was a bit nervewracking).

1362786893.0,19xyug,Some meditations about violence and the Police in general,krautcop,86,14,59,"I was sitting here watching some late night Scrubs (it's 11:15 PM here)

Here in Germany, namely the separation of judicative, executive and legislative powers.

**The word Gewalt has two translations: it means power

We as cops are the executive power. We have power and we use violence. The government has invested in us the power to hurt and even kill people

In an ideal world, which means we sometimes get angry, vengeful, make mistakes and lose control. It is not ideal, but it is the only choice we have. Now, some people might argue that we do not need Police at all and I hope that at some time in the future, when we as a race have grown

For now, for better.

I truly believe that most Police Officers get into this career for the right reasons. That is, in their way of making up catchphrases.

In the Academy, until the final step of shooting someone.

This is something I feel more people need to realize: **The Police is not supposed and not trained to react with identical levels of violence. We can always go one step higher on the ladder.**

What I mean by that is, I can punch you.

If you attack me with your fists

If you come at me with a knife

If you bring a gun

You're a big guy? Hell

Like 10-13 said in another post

We are trained to bring a situation under control quickly and with as little harm to others and ourselves as possible. Quickly usually takes precedence, if you see a guy on the ground locking his arms in front of his body and the officer punches him, that is not police violence. That is called a pain compliance technique. I will punch you to make you feel pain, until the pain is so great that you will no longer resist me. There are other, less messy techniques, like pain pressure points (try pressing your index finger into the soft part behind your earllobe, next to your jaw. Hurts, but they don't work on everyone.

Sure, if someone isn't MUCH weaker than you, if he simply locks his arms under his body and holds them, you do not stand a chance in hell to get them out by yourself. If the person is drunk or on drugs, he can seem the like goddamn Hulk.

This is where the number advantage comes into play. If you see multiple officers on one suspect, because while I might not be able to get his arms on his back by myself, four cops pulling on his arm will do the trick.

One thing the Academy did not prepare me for

Me and my partner arrive and there are maybe 8 or more visibly drunk and aggressive people talking angrily to the EMTs and not letting them do their job. We tell them to move back, raised them and ordered them to step back.

Suddenly, but instead he grabs me in a kind of bear hug around my waist, his hand very close to my gun. I wasn't sure if he was still holding on to my baton at this point and I decided I need to end this quickly. I tell him to let go of me, but he doesn't and I start to punch him in the only place I could reach with his awkward position, his face. I hit him at least 10 times, but he just wouldn't let go. Instead he drops to the ground (on purpose) and drags me down with him. Then my partner turned around (he had been keeping the angry mob at bay) and tries to help me get the guy off of me. He was still holding on to me, then he hit me in the face and I punched him a couple more times, but the situation was under control in about 30 seconds
Backup arrived about 20 seconds later.

Those were the longest goddamn 50 seconds of my life. If they would put me under oath right there

Now, he was just holding on to me, right? But as a cop in that situation, it was more than that. I was afraid he was going to grab my gun, I was afraid if I dragged this out any longer, that the other people would decide to help their friend.

It's almost 01:00 AM now and this turned into a much longer rant than I wanted (and it was actually even longer before I deleted about 25%)

Non-cops, ENHANCE, replay and analyze every second at your liking and that hindsight is always 20/20.

Yeah, but I did not know this at the time and I had to make a decision in about half a second.

Rookie Cops, seconds will feel like minutes and minutes like hours. Oh and it will be scary. Scary as FUCK. When you are wrestling on the ground with a guy in the dead of night in some backyard and you're hearing the sirens come closer and closer, but no one is coming and you realize they don't know exactly where you are, you'll be just about ready to shit your pants.

So, both the husband and wife were pretty calm, but the wife was a little more angry than the husband. Apparently, the wife wanted the husband out of the house because they were fighting over one thing or another. We talked to the husband, told him he didn't legally have to leave, but it may be a good idea to find somewhere else to go for the evening to let things settle.


The husband was pretty understanding and said he would stay at his friend's house. No big deal. We did the domestic report for the incident and then left.


Fast forward 2 hours. We get a call back to the same location. When we show up, and is now inside the bedroom. We took him out of the bedroom and placed him under arrest with no force - he turned around, we handcuffed, and walked out. We called the ambulance, she didn't want to go to the hospital. Did the reports, dropped him at the precinct with another officer who would process the arrest, and went back out on patrol.


Fast forward again


We show up for a call of 2 men fighting. We get there to a local bar notorious for trouble


I was in shock. I walked up to her


A wild thought came into my mind as we were on our way back... ""Why am I even trying to help these people?"". I know, and if I don't take action in those situations, nobody will. Why do I put myself and others at risk driving at high speeds to rush to an assault call, or a robbery, when the next day (or next hour) the same victim that we help will just be there doing everything they can to make us miserable?

There's a lot of threads published about police-candidates who get discouraged when they get rejection or disqualification letters.  The most common replied comments are advice telling you to stick it through and keep applying.  

In the last three to four years I've applied to well over a dozen police agencies, passed and made it to the polygraph three times, and passed twice more for the final chief interview.  Every single time I eventually got the rejection/disqualification letter.  Yes, every time I got the notice I wanted to just quit trying.  However, I want to be a police officer; in the last four years I've attained a CJ degree and have worked for private security/investigation companies attaining massive amounts of good starting experience, even completing an internship with a very respected police agency.  I told myself I wasn't going to quit.  

Finally, I finally was offered a position as a police officer.  Why?  I didn't quit.  Being a police officer is something I've dreamed of since I was little.  If you truly want to be a police officer you won't quit, no matter how many doors get slammed in your face.

I'm excited to start and been getting ready as much as I can.  I'm researching threads on here for advice for rookies, quick clot, etc.).  

I just wanted to tell everyone who has been getting told ""no"" like me to push through it only if you have the courage and heart to do so.  I don't have the perfect background

My new police agency is pretty strict about internet stuff, I did get hired in good ole' West Virginia.

Law enforcement is a very specific set of skills.  For the most part, etc.  These examples are rather few and far between.  Law enforcement also is rather unique in that you have academies that teach you these specific sets of skills.

Most departments run their own academy, but thats rather rare.  Either way, you're going to spend between 12 and 36 weeks in some sort of specific training environment before you hit the road.  In here in addition to teaching you how to shoot, drive, fight, render first aid, and other cool stuff, traffic code, criminal process

In a criminal justice program at your university you are going to learn criminal law, 4th and 5th amendments, search and seizure, criminal process, etc.

See where I'm going with this?  For cops who want to get a degree because their department requires one for promotion, but the bread and butter is what we've been doing for years.  

For a department hiring someone, and dedication to spend X years studying a specific skill set.  Some guys every now and then prefer to see a CJ degree, but the cons will outweigh the pros here.

Remember how I said we have a specific skill set?  LEOs get hurt pretty frequently.  Don't be so quick to jump to the statistics about how fishing and construction are more deadly.  They may be, and statistics.  Most of the ones I've read on this subject don't take into account attempted murders upon officers, but that's irrelevant to your conversation.  What is relevant is you can be put out of your job without being killed.  

One bad crash, and you injure your spine, or lose a leg.  You may have been the best cop in the world but if you can't walk without a cane, you can't do this job.  Even without being physically injured, maybe the job is just too much for you one day.  You get worn out of the crappy people, the hurt people, and seeing terrible stuff.  Depression is common among law enforcement, cause you cant do this job forever.

So when you left the department early for whatever reason, but what I've been getting at in this post is this - have a backup plan.  Get your degree in something you love, or something you can do as a backup.  It may mean the difference in coming out of this job, and hopping into another one you can really enjoy, or not being able to find a decent job at all.

I give the people in the sedan their information and forms and tell them to have a good one.

If you're curious

Officer _______

My name is Id_rather_be_eating. You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/drugged out of my mind. I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me. 

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was. You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am. There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night. I had a relationship end with a girl I moved for after only six months, and a number of other chronic issues. Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much. Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years. I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II. It has the highest suicide rate among all forms of depression. 

Most of that night comes back in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined. You are very clear presence throughout that memory though. You were professional, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours. To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me. You weren't supposed to. I'm glad you did. Since then, I've gone through quite a few changes. I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life. I feel shaken, and good. 

I have no idea what your life is like. I don't know if you love or hate your job. I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you were just as lonely as I was. I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life. You were a calming presence for my family when you eventually talked and they wish to say thank you as well. I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and somewhere, he thinks of you often. I will never forget you.

1344058917.0,xns9j,A little advice from my dad (has been in law enforcement for about 30 years),ardtanker312,67,16,22,"Hey everyone, let me give you a little history about my dad. He started his career working as a part-timer at a shore town during college. He then moved on to first the Coast Guard for four years, where he's been a cop here for 17 years. He's now a sergeant in patrol. Feel free to add those years up. Anyways

1. Love the guys on your shift. This job becomes more about them than anything else. They may not be the best guys in the world

2. Remember why you signed up to be a cop. Protect and Serve is written all over our profession. I'm not worried about the protecting part. I have no doubt you guys love to catch bad guys. But remember the serve part most of all. Perform wellness checks on the old people, take him through the patrol car, make him feel like a cop. This how we can really prevent crime.

3. Give breaks. Be the ""nice"" cop to the people that deserve it. Let them tell their friends about your courtesy and respect. Tell the underage drinkers to dump the booze and have a good night. On the flip side

4. Find something else that you love, walk with my wife, swim with one son, and lift weights with his brother.

5. Final thing. Remember, you start being rough on people, then they won't believe in Law and Order. Liam Neeson said something the first batman, and i have my own twist to it, If you devote yourself to the idea that our justice system works, if you make yourself more than just some dude with a gun and a blue uniform, then you become something bigger. You become a symbol of justice
Good luck in all of your careers

However


1) **Knowledge is complete power with this job.** I pride myself on knowing the laws of my city back and front, be more careful, and don't let me catch him doing whatever he was doing again.


2) **Have discretion... don't be a supercop.** Where I work there are over 8 million people residing. There is no need to write every single person. Arrests are different - if someone is breaking a law that is an automatic arrest


3) **Treat people with respect**, unless of course they are doing something that warrants them not respectable (fighting with the police, spitting at us, you get the idea). Do this because you may not remember all of the people you arrest, but they will remember you. When you're out at the park with your family they will see you. You won't see them. Will they attack you because you tortured them for hours before they were sent to bookings? Or will they simply ignore it and keep walking? That choice is yours to make.



4) **Get a hobby.** Your entire life cannot be police work or you will go insane. I play a lot of video games in my free time because it relaxes me and keeps me happy when I need a pickup. If you eat


5) **Be yourself and don't change for the worse.** You're going to change... you are going to start being more aware of your surroundings. You will always face the door when you are out eating to see who is coming in and what is going on. You'll always be cautious. It's okay, because I can talk to them about stress and problems with the job and they will understand. But sometimes you don't want to talk about work, so I have another set of old friends that I see as well that keep me level.


6) **Don't forget what it was like before you were a cop.** It was scary seeing a police car behind you. It was scary when cops approached you on the street. It scares people. You can be the nicest cop in the world


7) **Keep your body and your mind sharp.** Run a few times a week... stay active. Join a baseball league and play on your days off for an hour or two. Just keep yourself in shape and you will be a lot happier on this job. I came on the job horribly out of shape after 4 years of college - beer and wings did it in for me. I started running


8) **Learn to talk to people.** They are people, they are the residents. Let them voice their concerns, and allow yourself to listen. Don't ever think you are better than someone just because you are an officer. If someone is indeed a piece of shit (and you will encounter a LOT of these people) let it be because they are that way that you act the way you do towards them. But if someone is coming to you for help, treat them as a person - not as a statistic.


9) **Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.** If someone needs to be put down because they are causing harm to you or someone else, pull the trigger. We need to be able to make those hard choices. It isn't easy to live with, but you are the only person who is going to make that choice. You're an officer, not a civilian any more. You're not a hero until you do something heroic. Be brave - when the gunshots go off and everyone is running away, you're the one that has to run towards them. 

10) Finally, but overall your job is to protect them - even if that means protecting them from themselves. Don't ever think that someone who is calling you for help with their problems doesn't matter, because after responding to the same type of job 1,000,000 times it may not mean much to you - but it is the end of the world for them. Have compassion.

My first day, or what the hell central was assigning over the radio. It was a solitary feeling I had even though there were a lot of people on the street.


I was out of my comfort zone, and people walking by on the street seemingly sizing me up or flashing looks my way.


So I stool vigilant on my post. I had a mentality about me - a tightened sense of awareness. I played through my academy training and things I would do in certain situations. Fear was a factor being out there.


Then, then she asked me some stuff about my belt and my badge. Kid questions. I was friendly and chatted with her about the handcuffs and the radio, then she waved and left with her mother who.just came out of a store.


It was surprising. There I was, but to be a part of the community for better or for worse.


The next day was the same up until a robbery came over the radio. I made my way, a foot pursuit came over the radio a block away. I took off running to get there and ended up assisting the officer in the arrest of the robbery suspect.

The policeman stood and faced his God
Which must always come to pass.
He hoped his shoes were shining.
Just as brightly as his brass.

""Step forward now
How shall I deal with you? 
Have you always turned the other cheek?
To My church have you been true?""

The policeman squared his shoulders and said
""No,
Because those of us who carry badges
can't always be a saint.

I've had to work most Sundays
and at times my talk was rough
and sometimes I've been violent
Because the streets are awfully tough.

But I never took a penny
That wasn't mine to keep....
Though I worked a lot of overtime
When the bills got just too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help
Though at times I shook with fear.
And sometimes
I've wept unmanly tears.

I know I don't deserve a place
Among the people here.
They never wanted me around
Except to calm their fear.

If you've a place for me here
Lord
I never expected or had too much
But if you don't.....I'll understand.

There was silence all around the throne
Where the saints had often trod.
As the policeman waited quietly
For the judgment of his God.

""Step forward now
You've borne your burdens well.
Come walk a beat on Heaven's streets
You've done your time in hell.""

1364731758.0,1bcry7,One to watch for! (Chemical Suicide).,PeelianPl3b,48,8,24,"Hi All.

I'm sure most if not all of you are aware of chemical suicide and the problems that it poses for us as first responders. However I'll explain it anyway in case anyone is unfamiliar. A person who wishes to commit suicide will mix together some chemicals which will release noxious gases that in a confined space will prove fatal or they may use something like a smokeless barbecue which will release Carbon Monoxide. 

Usually people who do this will leave a note on the door explaining the presence of noxious chemical fumes or there may be a note which simply says ""do not enter

My main point here is that we have in the UK recently found one instance of a person leaving no warning note at the front door of their house after committing suicide in this manner and also tried to harm officers by leaving an amount of the powered chemical on the doorstep to be mixed with a chemical on the inside of the door. This is believed to be an deliberate attempt to harm police officers. Anything like that

Ask yourself how can you help
----

If you're looking to become law enforcement to look cool in front of your friends, birthdays, special days, for low pay and not even a thank you in many cases. I'll break it to you right here: Many days are boring, and every day is a lot of paper work. Sound exciting?

Here's a reason to join law enforcement: If you have the ability to help stop crime in your community and you really want to.. you should feel morally obligated to do so

The best way to earn experience before being hired on and put through an academy, and it is easy, and fun to do while enrolled in college. Not all departments offer these programs, so check with near-by cities. Many police deparments have cut down on funding, so check with Pell Grants or loan options to put yourself through an academy at a college or university. You will be reimbursed upon hiring. (Make sure that you are).


The dos:
----

Stay drug free. and physically fit. It's a moral obligation to yourself, and be healthy, you'll make it through the academy, and it can help save yours and others' lives when you're hired and on duty.

Keep your personal problems to your friends and family


Know your laws. Many states have revised coded (Like Ohio Revised code) that cities are adopting. Look in to it.

Traffic laws, and domestic disturbance laws. Knowing these laws will help you, as you progress through the academy, it's easier to remember when they're things you've already learned.

Train your memory: when you walk in to someone's house, what they're wearing, smells, small details that most people would overlook. This will help you when you become an officer, as you've already trained yourself to do it.


Do nots:
----

Do not involve yourself with 'friends' or others that involve themselves in illegal activity. Stay away from drug dealers

Follow the traffic laws

Never lie. Even if the truth hurts.

Never lie about being a police officer. Even if you are in the academy or want to be one. This is illegal

I am a veteran who has struggled to adjust with anxiety and PTSD since being honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps active duty in XXXX. It was hard to get my life back on a positive track

On XXX street in xxxx around xxxx pm x/xx/xx I made an error in judgement and turned into another car for a minor fender bender. I was already a mess since my xxx(family member) died the day prior. 

We stopped in a nearby parking lot to exchange information. I had no idea the adrenaline rush from the surprise impact would bring back a panic attack which i haven't had in years. The nice lady whom I hit called the police as I probably looked extremely shady and skittish. Two cruisers showed up

I don't remember their names, even though I probably acted like a suspicious person.

Yes

Quick background:  I applied to a suburban dept, good on financials, no serious convictions, etc. So, I figured, I'll be honest and nothing can go wrong.

I thought the process would be breeze.  Man oh man, my answers, wow...

I can only assume my answers led me to be the candidate denied the position.  So

Have you ever masturbated while driving a vehicle?
-Yes

Have you ever engaged in prostitution?
-Yes

Have you ever had group sex?
-Yes

Have you ever masturbated at work?
-Yes

Have you ever performed a sexual act with someone while at work?
-Yes

Have you ever ""sexted"" someone?
-Yes.  Most recently probably a year ago to my now ex.

Have you ever had sex with a minor?
Yes

These are all I can remember for now; but I think I covered everything.  After the experience I kind of realized how much of a scumbag I was and knew that after the chief read my answers there would be no way I would get hired - even though I was honest and apparently passed.  I still feel like a scumbag, I guess.  

Anyone care to share their embarrassing answers to make me feel a little better?

Last night, writing up some tickets. I was trying to keep traffic from snarling at an intersection when a group of men started crossing diagonally and sauntering down the middle of the street, thus preventing vehicles from passing through the intersection. I asked them to please get out of the street so cars could pass by and one of them yelled ""F- you, you aren't even a real cop."" My CO heard this and turned to the group, informing them that he was a real cop and demanding that they get out of the street as I had directed because they were obstructing traffic. 
The group stood their ground in the middle of the street and wouldn't back away and when my CO told them that they needed to obey his lawful order to leave the street, and saunters away with his group. 

I'm just so frustrated. It wasn't worth the time and effort of my CO calling in the duty captain who

I'm somewhat ok with this Lt. calling us fake cops - I know that we probably look ridiculous to lots of regulars, and function. 
But what really gets me is that this Lt. found fit to pull rank on a uniformed officer - my CO - who is just trying to do his job. This Lt. and his buddies who are out drinking and having a good time and who ought to know better than to walk down the middle of the street. These guys who are supposed to know what it's like to deal with traffic at a busy intersection and what the street level cop has to deal with. 
Instead, and walks off like he's the king of the world. He abused his badge, he abused his authority, and he sullied the reputation of the department. Other pedestrians saw this interaction, saw him flip out his badge and walk away. 

I love law enforcement. I think 9/10 cops are outstanding and dedicated officers. Every Sgt. and Lt. I've met at my precinct has been respectful, no a calling, in keeping the peace. But sometimes, things like this just really rub me the wrong way.

I am currently seeking out and officer position now that I've graduated college. I guess what I've noticed is how the public forgets police are human. This creates the ""us vs. them"" mentality as police feel the public generally hates them. Their are bad cops trust me I've seen it
People seem to think cops have no emotions when in truth they have to deal with all the shit the public gives them and put on a happy face. I don't think the public understands that cops deal with child deaths, paramedics as well but no love to cops. Yes the videos of the past days are examples of horrible cops all though some are not in context at all. You can go on youtube and find less videos on cops being shot and abused then the other way around.

Tired, and wanting a drink.

Having plenty of time on my hands (I was doing overtime to babysit a prisoner in the cells who was asleep whilst our nightshift crew were dealing with a suicidal female) I was sitting in the office wondering what was giving me job satisfaction.

I had moved from one of the busiest 3 stations in my state to ... a very quiet station. I was used to armed rob, fix it. I was wondering what it was I was doing, and why I was doing it. How am I changing my community, making it better?

I spent tonight, tail lights, indicators operating properly. For having bald tyres, for driving 10km over the speed limit, for having too many passengers whilst being on a restricted licence.

I realised why I still loved doing what I do

I realised that every time I had a discussion with a friend

Not only do people talk about police encounters to their friends

Every interaction I had tonight I was positive, or 2, or a warning, or they had to fix something on their car, I've never had more people laugh, be polite, or thank me.

That's why I love my job, hopefully I just made 300 people think more positively of the police. So maybe, next time, a brother is less likely to get attacked unprovoked, or is more likely to get information for a serious crime.

I was sitting at a red light the other night on duty and decided to run the plates of the truck sitting next to me. They came up expired for approximately two years. I flip my lights on and initiate a stop. My cover officer discovered a rifle and ammunition in plain view from the passenger side that I could not see from the driver's side. We will call this guy Fred. 

We ask Fred to exit the vehicle. His inspection, we have the option of issuing citations right away or we could really mail a citation up to two years later. 

I realize that people lie to us and it is commonplace

I feel that he is being genuine and since the warrant stems from his inability to pay a previous ticket

Anyway, Fred looks at my other officer. My other officer looks back at him and says ""whatever happens with those citations are up to him"" as he points to me. I look at Fred and explain to him to check and make sure that a vehicle is legal before driving it. Also, I tell him to pay attention to little things like insurance and inspections stickers. 

I then verbally warn him about the citations that I could have issued. He almost broke down crying in joy. He was actually happy to be in jail. I probably saved him $1500 in citations. 

I feel that I genuinely corrected behavior while making a positive impact in one's life.

We went back and booked another person in later that night and learned that one of Fred's friends had already gotten him out of jail. I wish to see Fred again on different terms because I genuinely feel that he is happy and extremely impressed by the mercy that I showed him.

What would the average citizen say if it were proposed that Police Officers be assigned to a neighborhood which was inhabited by no one but criminals and those Officers would be unarmed

We are Correctional Officers and Deputies.  Not Guards (who are people that watch school crossings).  We work at minimum, rules, and regulations of the Department of Correctional Services.  In short we are Policemen.  Our beat is totally inhabited by felons who, by definition, are people who tend to break laws, rules, and regulations.  We are outnumbered by as many as 50 to 1 at various times of our work day and contrary to popular belief, our necks are on the line every minute of every day.

A Correctional Facility is a very misunderstood environment.  The average person has very little knowledge of its workings.  Society sends it's criminals to Correctional Facilities and as time passes

Correctional Facilities are full of violence perpetrated by the jail population against the jail population and facility staff.   Felonies are committed daily but are rarely reported.  They are called ""unusual incidents"" and rarely result in criminal prosecution.  Discipline is handled internally and, many Officers have endured the humiliation of having urine and feces thrown at them.  Uncounted Correctional Officers/Deputies have been kicked, bitten, stabbed and slashed with homemade weapons, taken hostage, murdered and even raped in the line of duty, all while being legally mandated to  maintain their Professional Composure and refraining from any retaliation which could be the basis for dismissal from service.

In addition to these obvious dangers, Hepatitis B and C.  Courts are now imposing longer sentences and the jail and prison population is increasing far beyond the systems designated capacity.  As the public demands more police on the street, governments everywhere are cutting police in Correctional Facilities where violence reins supreme, jeopardizing all those working behind prison walls.

Although you will never see us on ""911"" or ""Top Cops"" we are Law Enforcement Professionals.  We are the ""FORGOTTEN COP, hoping someday to receive the respect and approval from the public who ""WE SILENTLY SERVE.""

I know that there are many cons that police endure like department politics, odd scheduling that interferes with family life, ect. But basically, I need some advice, and the way I can narrow it down into a question is: Do you wake up everyday, and look forward to work, loving what you do?

All the police and detectives I've talked to are generally clueless about technology and tools. I'm not going to say it's a large sampling, I've had some good conversations filling them in on stuff like this. This, plus data mining (textpipe) and other scraping tools linked together (scrapebox is neat, even for this type of stuff) and tools for mirroring like Offline Explorer allow you to archive stuff and search it fast if you're looking for needles in haystacks.


The easiest way to find someone I've found it common usernames or common people that you can use for context. If you worked hard enough, I own domains, etc.

As the guy says in the tutorial above ""The real power of -searching for information about people and groups- [Maltego] is when -you do a lot of searches- [you run a whole lot of them] and look at how they link together.


Maltego links those things together. I could probably track down a number of people associated with bad things and would if someone would pay me. I've used it for everything from finding out who someone really is to finding unlisted addresses and phone numbers.

Kody was Saint Paul Officer Dave Longbehn's K9 partner and with the assistance of the U.S. Marshals they were called to the address for a suspect yesterday.  The suspect was hiding in the basement and K9 Kody was sent in to get the suspect out.  At that point the suspect stabbed Kody which evenutally was fatal for Kody on his way to the Vet Hospital.  

Here is a cool story on the background of K9 Kody: [Background Story](http://www.kare11.com/video/default.aspx?bctid=2160966238001)

as we looked for the house the dispatcher reported she was unresponsive and not breathing. 

As we pulled in we pulled out our equipment ( a VBM and a defibrillator)
we entered the room where she was in

1357489516.0,162cc5,Question for male officers about female officers,CivillianTechie,28,8,21,"Obviously

I used to believe that female officers had no place outside the public relations or education units

However

I had a (large) male officer tell me that sometimes just his presence at a potential fight seems to trigger it

I had a (petite) female officer tell me that she often gets dispatched to domestics and can make a peaceful arrest and later break guys into tears and a confession with a few kind words where male officers usually have to result to force for the arrest and don't get any cooperation in an interview.

I've sort of come around to the possibility that there is a place for both kinds of officers - the social worker and the brawler.  On the other hand

I'm new to the Bay Area and just stopped an extremely nice Benz for running a red.  Inside the car are three teenagers (all males) who are dressed like gangsters

The stop is going well we even made a bit of small talk

As I'm just sitting there going ""WTF is this shit?""

I finally recover meanwhile and head for the pair

So I have my quandary, I just can't stand there while someone gets the hell slapped out of them on the street, right?   I go in and separate them, confirm the the older man is the father.  I take the teenager aside for a moment and ask him if he wants me to do anything about this and get a firm ""no, please no"" from the teenager.  

For the rest of the stop the dad stands there when I'm speaking with the teenager, driving like that, embarrassing the family (if you haven't guessed by now, I'm the only non Asian involved in this scene).  When I come back with the ticket, dad is on the phone to get a tow truck because he's taking the car away right now.  Dad also tries to make his son pay the ticket right now and has his son apologize to me for making me write the ticket in the first place.  I explain how the ticket will take two days to be on file and you can pay it at the city administration center.  

A week later I get a handwritten letter of apology from the guy I pulled over.  I can just see his dad standing over him going *slap* ""Write more respectfully!"" *slap*

Two years later I run into the same guy after he was rear ended.  When I do the report I'm careful to write out ""DRIVER 1 NOT AT FAULT"" in big block letters on my report so he can show his father.

Maybe we could use this as a place to ask other international police forces some questions?


In Australia, you don't get ""employed"" by an agency like I see a lot of you guys talking about. In Victoria, one of the states in Aus, We apply through an external agency to sit an exam, do that, then undertake another series of tests (physical, psychological, etc.) and then get offered a spot in that states in academy. We do that, you enforce that states laws. (To put this in comparison

It seems like in the US you guys have... towns (counties?) that operate their own police forces. I imagine they perform the type of ""uniform"" jobs in that area that we do for our state. As in, drug trades etc, disputes, welfare checks etc. So does one town (county?) only enforce \ have jurisdiction in THEIR town\county, or do they have it throughout the entire state?

Then you have... State troopers? What is that? I have difficulty understanding how they operate if each town\county operates their own force?

How does funding work for towns that have tiny populations? Is the dept. funded by that towns tax-payers

I may be way off the mark here


What gear do you guys carry? How many Firearms? How many sets of cuffs? What other gear?

Personally, I carry a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P40 semi-auto (Which is issued by my dept. I get no choice in it, it stays at the station, it gets issued to me when I clock it on, and I return it when I clock off), a spare mag, and a small torch. On my Left hand side, to furthest away), and 1 (of my own
If I wore an IOEV (Integrated Operational Equiptment Vest) [Kevlar vest] I would wear everything on my vest other than my firearm which would stay on my hip.

It seems like a lot of you guys carry a second shooter somewhere, but I've personally never found it necessary.



How does paperwork work for you guys? For us, we will apprehend the offender, arrest them, convey them to the station, interview them on disc (ie asking them a series of questions), release them either pending summons, on bail, the arresting officer is responsible for the resulting paperwork, depending on how many statements there are to be taken

I recently applied to be a police officer, military experience, or other LEO jobs. People who have spent years getting to this point. I don't want to sound sheepish, I am confident in my abilities - but on paper I don't think I would get a second look.

For me, have an extensive knowledge of cameras, computers, and software - but not sure how far, if at all, that will get me. You could say my goal of becoming a LEO finally caught back up to me - and I would be leaving a career that pays much more.

I am in decent shape and am not worried about the PT test or any type of background or criminal history checks - clean as a whistle not even a traffic ticket. 

I haven't taken the written test yet. However

I've lived in some unique areas

I guess what I am asking is if on paper

I appreciate any comments or tips you can give me.
Thanks.

My sergeant had called me to the station.  There is a skate park nearby that is a magnet for malfeasance and miscreants.  Today, one of the boys at the park (17, an adult), started antagonizing my sergeant.  He apparently had a beef with a littering ticket he had received a week or so prior.  He was rather loud and his language profane, so I broke away and confronted the kid.  The kicker is that he is my neighbor.

I first asked him what the problem was, and according to our city's disorderly conduct ordinance, he could be arrested for disturbing the peace.  He and I began a back and forth discussion.  It was heated, but civil.  I didn't want any trouble for this kid, but I was trying to get him to understand an appropriate venue to express his dissatisfaction with police and this particular sergeant, but he wouldn't really have it.  During this discussion, my corporal shows up and clears the gallery that had formed around me and this kid.  After the kid sees that, ""Great, mainly in an official capacity,"" after which

Before the kid even got the words out of his mouth, ""I'm giving you ever opportunity to avoid this.  Please don't do this.""  I was so frustrated by this.  He refused to process for the corporal and actually said something rather threatening to him apparently, but I was not there to witness it.

After he was secured in booking, but he's made big strides in getting away from his old lifestyle of drug use and deliquency.  He does, however, have an anger problem.

I processed him quickly and gave him a summons to appear in court, he said.  Now, I won't pretend I'm a perfect officer or that my peers are perfect, but I know that a few of the officers he spoke about certainly do have a poor attitude when they are around certain elements of our citizens.  Almost abrasively so.  I spent a lot of time trying to counsel this kid about controlling his emotions and finding an appropriate venue to express them.

I guess my question for you all is this; should I continue making an effort to connect with this kid and help him along?  I have a somewhat unorthodox approach to law enforcement, my department, my community, and most importantly, the kid?

A Range-Rover car was engaging in multiple driving infractions on the Paris beltway. At 5:30 am

- [Alleged drunk driver kills two Paris police in chase](http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/alleged-drunk-driver-kills-two-paris-police-in-chase_259377.html)

- [Article (in French) from *Le Parisien*](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-un-accident-immobilise-le-periph-porte-de-clignancourt-21-02-2013-2586097.php)

**Update at 9pm**:

- François Molins, and thus he will charge the driver with murders (*homicide volontaire*) and attempted murder. The passenger will be charged with being an accomplice.
- In French law
- Murder's maximum sentence is 30 years (article 221-1 of the French Penal Code). In this specific case, 4th item). It is possible that the prosecutor might also invoke the 8th item of article 221-4: murder committed by several persons acting as an organized group. (I explain why later)
- Each of these three aggravating circumstances brings by itself the maximum sentence to perpetuity.
- The time during which no parole is available is usually of half the sentence length
- If the DA charges them with the 8th item (acting as an organized group) and the court validates this incrimination (I doubt that they would), 2nd paragraph)
- As a lawyer familiar with French penal law, meaning he'll serve at most 7 to 10 years. If the passenger retains a decent lawyer, he will probably walk, unless these morons manage to incriminate each other.
- Driver and passenger are currently (9pm) being interrogated.",self,t5_2ug10,1361479258.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/18xzkg/two_officers_dead_and_another_one_severely/

Due to a storm that blew through yesterday afternoon, only to find a sheriff patrol car sitting in the oncoming lane with POSSIBLY 8"" of rear bumper in our lane.

I slow down and begin approaching the vehicle

""Did you not see my car sitting here

""With all due respect sir, trying to keep the tone friendly.

""My car can't take up the whole road!"" he yelled at me

Allow me to add this is a two-lane road.  I'm driving my girlfriend's VW Golf, can take up both lanes of traffic.  You all should know a Crown Victoria can take up both lanes and then some.

""You may want to reposition your car so this doesn't happen again,"" I replied in a calm and (attempted) cheerful manner.

""You need to turn the fuck around and go another way.""

I was then pissed.

Without saying another word, and tried calling the sheriff's office.  I only got their voice mail, but I left a good one.  Unfortunately, I was so furious, I failed to get his name.  I did tell the sheriff's department when and where the incident took place and gave the voice mail system an earful (which I hope someone actually listened to).

Now... I did leave the complaint anonymously

Here's how I feel it should have gone:

**Deputy:**  ""There's a tree in the road/a wreck ahead

**Me:**  ""Thank you

**Deputy:**  ""Thanks for pointing it out.  Have a good night!""

The officer then asked if I'd been drinking.  I answered honestly

She asked if she could look in my car and I quietly and politely said 'no

She then called somebody to bring a breathalyzer to the scene.  Two more officers showed up 5-10 minutes later

She and the new arrivals then opened my car and began searching it.  I again quietly and politely indicated that I had not consented to a search.  The officers directed me to stay where I was and remain silent.  I asked why they were searching my car

They searched the console, and trunk.  They found no alcohol, drugs, weapons or anything else, because I'm a very boring law-abiding citizen.

I have no wants or warrants out on me.

The police department even sent a couple guys over to ask us what we needed during a certain high profile case.

The other police department is very tight-lipped. They fill out the absolute minimum on their incident reports, like what type of gun was recovered at the scene of a shooting or how much heroin was found in some guy's house. These facts are usually public record, and I can find them myself if I look hard enough. I've even told the officers as much, and they still won't provide any details without significant prodding.

I am an aspiring police officer and Senior in HS from the Midwest. In the last three weeks

The answer is most definitely Yes!

I took pad and paper with me to write notes down so that I could share them here and reflect on them. I am sure that all the officers here are already familiar with these topics, and definitely stories you have on them. 

**Ride Along Number One: Suburban Area

1. Constantly be alert and on the look out. NEVER become comfortable. Being caught off-guard by an assailant, the room you are in, the pocket bulges and hand placements of others. Keep your back to a wall whenever possible. Always have the mentality that the person you are dealing with might decide at any second ""I'm not going to prison, and I will kill to stay that way.""

2. Have your ducks in a row with everything you do. Paperwork quickly becomes tedious and dull. Staying thorough and covering every possible base is key to have a tight case. Know what you are doing

3. Your brothers and sisters in uniform are the most important people on earth. Backing them up safely is priority number one.

4. Don't be a hero. Call for back up before you absolutely need it. 

5. Be tough and assertive but have empathy. Understand people's motivations and what drives them to do what they do

6. On a firefighter/EMS assist call

7. Separating parties is crucial to getting different insights into a situation.

**Ride Along Number Two: Small Town/Rural Area**

1. Patrol Aggressively in search of crime. If you feel like you have nothing to do, immediately check it out.

2. Be friendly and professional. See Verbal Judo.

3. Be extremely visible

**Ride Along Number Three: Suburban/Urban area.**

1. Estimate a vehicles speed before radar/laser 

2. Be nice to the EMT's and firefighters

3. Learn Spanish

4. Never forget you are protecting a community as well as the people inside it.

5. Your family comes first

6. Check the trunk to see if it is popped with a touch on traffic stops. Not doing so can get you killed.

7. Anticipate movement by watching a suspect's eyes and hands.

8. If you have to think ""Why is that person doing that?"" You need to investigate.

9. Use common sense. 

So what do you have to add? Stories or insight?

tl;dr: got nervous, examiner failed me for using countermeasures and lying about drug usage (I didnt lie)

So after nearly a year of testing, i was given the polygraph for a local department which i had had my eyes set on from the start.

Being it's my first poly, and afterwards got up, left the room, and came back and had me count from one number to another backwards and in sets of three's while still connected to the machine. This helped ease my mind as I was focused on counting the entire time.

After the countdown, ""have you lied on your background packet?"", and ""have you done any drugs other then marijuana (one time usage)?"". Throughout this entire process, I was extremely nervous and just focused on my breathing and singing songs in my head, trying to follow everyone's advice of not ""over-thinking it"" considering I was extremely nervous.

After the exam, to which I honestly replied no, and he continued to explain that i was breathing deeply to try and beat the machine and that i was lying and would be disqualified. Regardless, he ran through the questions a second time.

Now, trying to breath faster since he thought my slow breathing was me consciously using a countermeasure. At the end of it, I said ""it's kind of weird forcing myself to breath faster"". He immediately said ""What'd you say?"", to which I told him ""It feels weird trying to breath faster"". He then had me write down what I said, left the room, and came back to inform me that I had admitted to using countermeasures on camera and was being disqualified.

The kicker of it is that he then proceeded to show me my results and tell me that I was also lying about drug usage. He then began to grill me, I told the truth when he asked if I was intending to lie, and when I said no to ""did you leave anything intentionally off your background"", but was lying about using drugs.

I'm an RCMP Officer(Royal Canadian Mounted Police for those of you outside Canada) in Edmonton. I'm 25 and this is currently my second year on the job.

We never see each other ever and when we do it's maybe an hour or two a day in which we sometimes have sex or we just don't at all. Anyways today was a regular day nothing special happened but I couldn't help but think the entire day while driving along that is being an RCMP officer worth it? Is it worth potentially getting shot? Is it worth not being able to see the woman I love all the time? I'm also tired of any and all teenagers I run into absolutely hating my guts. I feel like all this negative attention is being put at me and I know that it's bound to happen going into our profession but it feels like it's been slowly eating away at me for years. I put all this time and effort I started at 18 working out at the gym to get bigger and went for runs to get into shape just so I could be a Police Officer like my father before me was and his father before him. I just feel like I have to live up to the family name and stay on as one when I seriously feel like quitting and doing something else. I love my job yet I absolutely hate it sometimes.

Ever since I was young I knew I wanted to be a police officer, I left and felt horrible. An extremely stressful month passed, not knowing if I would be moving on or not. That is, until last week, when they finally called me back. They wanted to set up a second polygraph since I was a ""good"" candidate almost ""too good"" as she said, which is why they think I was lying and needed to take another. 


So, which wasn't ""normal"". I took the test and was asked if there was anything else I'd like to say. I just reaffirmed to her that I was very nervous, before she let me leave. 


This brings me to today. A few hours ago I got an email saying I was not selected to move on. It was heartbreaking. After all this work I put into this whole process. I sat there and stared at the messaged for a few minutes. I can't believe its all over because of the polygraph. What hurts the most is that I didn't lie, which probably wouldn't turn out well for me. I thanked him for his time and got off the phone. Now, I'm not sure what I should do. I feel like such a failure, and that I let so many people down. I'm not looking forward to telling everyone that I didn't get in, especially since a lot of family friends are police offers themselves for this department. 


My question is, even when I go to the doctors, the moment they start speaking, my blood pressure and heart-rate shoot through the roof. I don't know why it happens, it just does. I'm just concerned that if I apply for this department or another department, they will see that I already failed the test twice and may disqualify me without anymore consideration.

I throw my clothes off for mad pay once a week. 


My application is in,000 residents and I have been invited to an interview. Background investigation will be after that. 

I am asking out of curiosity. Knowledge is power and I would like to be able to anticipate some future events. However

I am not going to lie or hide any part of my life
 
I work as a stripper with a fake nameand I am unrecocnizable while working. 
Only one who knows my real name through this profession is the IRS and the clubs accountant and pay admin. 

I pay all all my taxes fully and I do something that most people don't by filing all my cash tips too. You drive roads to your work

Will my profession be an issue in the application process?
I have:

- college degree with a 4.0 GPA throughout my school career

- solid work history

- volunteer positions at local shelters

- police officers willing to recommend me

- no citations or convictions. 

- very good demeanor

- physically proficient

- excellent taste for donuts. 

-  100% LA Noire completion. I consider this to be my major selling point for the job. ",self,t5_2ug10,1366002730.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1ccsee/applying_to_become_a_police_officer_used_to_work/

Anyways

**How long is the application process?** Typically 8 months at minimum in America.

**When should you apply?** Apply 6 months to a year before graduating college or leaving the military. This should help avoid sitting around for months on end waiting for a spot for the police academy

**What does the application process consist of?** It varies from department to department but on average: Agility test, Background interview, Panel/Board interview, Medical test, Written Psychological test, Psychological interview, Polygraph/CVSA

**What Degree or MOS should I have to become a officer?** I was once told, any MOS will work because it is not the job that you had but the experience you have from the military.

**What do I wear to interviews?** Other than the agility test

**How should I prepare for the academy?** First off, chain of command, etc etc. I was recently told to use flashcards or quizlet.com, it will seriously help so go try it.

Lastly **What questions will I be asked during interviews and the Polygraph/CVSA?** Basic questions, just be honest and hope for the best. I personally do not believe in the test, I have passed one and almost failed one. However, if you are looking for an edge or tips on how to pass the Polygraph/CVSA, you wont receive any from me. The test sucks and is nerve racking, but it is what it is. 

That is all I could think of off the top of my head. I hope this helps at least one person.

Location is in the USA
I am an online retailer (merchant). A customer paid $1000 with paypal on a credit card for goods that needed to be shipped on a pallet with a freight company. The customer lives in an apartment that could not accept this type of delivery. We agreed to ship it to the local freight terminal where he can pick it up. This is common practice in my industry. 

I ship the pallet and 2-3 days later receive notification that the paypal account holder and credit card holder reversed the charge stating that it was unauthorized use. 

I am not going to use real names

After I thought about this for a while I thought back about 6 months ago to an order I received for the same item.  I received that order by phone and Bart Simpson was the one that ordered it.  About 4 hours later Marge Simpson called and said Bart was an dumbass and wasn't supposed to be ordering stuff and to cancel the order

So it seems like Bart is using Marge and Homers accounts. It also seems like they gave him access since Bart's ebay account is directly tied to Homer's paypal account. It isn't a new account either


I called the freight terminal in Springfield and let them know what was going on. Sure enough Bart came to pickup the shipment.  I have a signed release for the merchandise

Will any detectives in springfield take this seriously?  Detectives in my city would

Homer is saying someone stole his credit card and Bart took delivery of the goods. If I have a police case paypal will reverse the charges.

I'm in the process of writing a novel, and a small cast of wayward heroes, including a police officer.

I don't know about you, that's me, and that's where you come in.

I'd like to find an officer as a consultant, is as close to how it would be handled in real life as possible. Your input would directly influence one of the main characters in the novel as they attempt to catch a killer.

In an attempt of full disclosure, and not the position they hold; the officer that is part of the main cast of characters is a good person, and paramount to the ideology of protecting and serving - perhaps not the embodiment of the law, but the spirit of the law.
