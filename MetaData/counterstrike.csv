I love 1.6 I have fond memories of playing it with my cousin and learning how to bhop

There is already a huge divide between source players and 1.6 players causing neither side to have the audience it deserves. 

All other forms of competitive games have grown Starcraft BW switched to Starcraft 2 and it will surely change again with heart of the swarm. TF2 and LoL have both evolved and changed with all the updates and add ons. Dota has switched to Dota 2.

With a new game coming out it is a great time for many people to switch. Will it reach the glory of 1.6 not immediately but with all of our help we can reach that point. We can bring a once great community back together and an AMAZING game to the forefront of competitive play.

This is a great time to ESEA is branching to Europe MLG just added a gamebattles part for it which may lead to it coming into atual MLG tournaments and hey if MLG picks us up then the Intel Extreme Masters may bring it in and a form of CS will be in it again.

I am not saying uninstall 1.6 and leave to die.

After months of playing with CS:GO modding

The system originally was just going to be direct input to the TV in cs_office, controllers, and wires to connect them!!

To play you press E on a cartridge to pick it up

There were no compromises here, the controllers have fully animated buttons, the controllers are plugged into the console and connected with a wire... yes!! it is amazing!!

There is only one game right now, its a bit different from real Mario but it uses ripped NES SMB sprites :)
The game only has one level

I'm really happy this was possible (the way it works is crazy!!)

It is an exclusive mod for our server right now

Anyway

Many thanks to these people to make this possible:
Knuckles for the original SNES model and textures
S.S.H for the music (http://youtu.be/Xj90Vcq2Kic 
Sound effects from Jake Kaufman/Virt's ridiculous Mario video with NEXTGEN AAA sound effects (http://youtu.be/u9wp6cz0A1o) 
and... Graphics stolen from Nintendo

Tell me what you think :)

Also during my development I bumped into this picture which probably invoked some insanity to make everything perfect:

1342722693.0,wtvop,Why I love CS:GO,ccasin,59,11,49,"We've all heard that lots of people don't like the CS:GO beta.  I got my key about a week ago and have logged about 25 hours.  I really love the new game

A little about my history with CS, but I've never been great.  While this makes me a casual player, I really value the team play aspect of CS.  I love getting up on the mic with a bunch of guys who are really into it, making good calls, executing strategies, etc.  Seeing a good plan come together or effectively responding as a team to changing circumstances is super satisfying, and that's why I play.


**Here are some things I love about the beta**:

* **5v5 match play is the default** - The matchmaking system puts people into 5v5 games.  These games are best of 30 matches (or best of 10, because it really encourages people to focus on team play and complete objectives.  Plus you get to know the other people on your team better - I've already met a bunch of fun players in the beta.

* **Bots are controllable** - If your 5v5 match isn't full, you can take control of a bot and keep playing.  So you never get stuck just watching bots play.

* **The dead speak** - In the ""classic competitive"" mode, so it's not like you can see what the other team is doing and cheat.  But you can tell your team where you died, give strategy advice, etc.  I think this adds a really fun dimension to the game.

* **Molotovs are fun** - I love the incendiary grenades.  They add a cool new strategic tool

* **Gun game is built in** - I've never really been a big gun game player, but the two they've made are nice.  The matchmaking has been doing a great job of putting me in games at my own level, too.

* **Easy to kick problem players** - Some asshole is team flashing?  AFK?  Not following the call?  A simple voting system is built in so you can quickly get rid of problem players.  This has downsides


**Some things I've seen complaints about**:

* **You can't spray** - I've definitely found that spraying is less accurate in GO than in Source or 1.6.  I'm not sure why people are so upset about this

* **The models are too hard to distinguish** - I thought this too, and hadn't even thought about it again until I saw a post complaining this morning.  It seems you just have to budget a few hours to get used to them - no big deal, it's a new game.

* **It's too pretty/cluttered/ugly** - There's a certain mentality in some parts of the 1.6 crowd - if they can't run the game at 200 FPS on a 5 year old laptop, and haven't found them to be too cluttered.  And part of the challenge is supposed to be learning the maps, knowing where to look and how to pick out things.  If I have any graphics complaints, it's that the gun models are chunky and ugly.

* **The movement is clunky** - This seems to be mostly a complaint about earlier iterations of the beta.  I suspect I'm not good enough to really judge


**Some complaints of my own**

* **Voting too easy** - In the competitive mode

* **Matchmaking and ranking must be more transparent** - The game gives you a symbolic rating

* **Silence

* **More maps** - Gun game desperately needs new maps


That's all I've got.  I really like the game and will be picking it up on release.  I'd love to hear what you think I'm missing

**Please note** that I did my best to provide the most common names for these spots. A lot of teams make up their own

**Map Notes**

Any call-out that is a light grey (instead of white) is underneath what the overlay is showing. For example ""Underpass"" on Mirage is underground and below where ladder room connects to catwalk

One spot on a few maps were not named by the many players we polled. We felt they were important calls

Nuke's lower level is separated and accentuated on the bottom left of the image.

Season's overview was pulled from the map .dds file just as the others were

We only created overviews for the maps that are commonly played competitively. As more maps are completed

**Dust2: Separated Catwalk, as there is a huge difference between someone on Short A near A Plat, and someone on Catwalk, just past ""Palm"", and players should be able to easily differentiate. ""Catwalk"" is named such because catwalks are usually thinner just as that area is. ""Cat"" breaks off from Catwalk. ""Short A"" is parallel to Long A, and is indeed shorter.
Added ""Cat Boost"".
Kept ""Palm"" despite the palm tree being removed in GO, and e-pole sounds weird. Actually I kind of like it, you can use that if you want.
Had no solid name for ""B Boxes"". Used ""B Boxes as all other boxes in B were named
Side of Pit and Pit Plat didn't necessarily have names with anyone that we polled

**New Mirage:**
Separated Catwalk and B Cat.
Created E-Stairs to replace E-Box due to landscape change and to differentiate from E-Box at B.
Gave ""Van"" in B a new name as ""Crates"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.
Gave ""Cart"" at the top of middle a new name

**Cache:**
B site's ""Corner"" was named instead of ""back site"" or ""deep site"" per the input of several competitive players.
Headshot Box is below Balcony in A

**Inferno:**
""Mexican"" or ""Mexi-Pit"" were not used on purpose
We opted to use several Source names as the maps in GO are very similar to Source when compared to 1.6.
""Tri-Box"" from 1.6 is named New Box as it was in Source.
""2nd"" is named 2nd instead of fruit
""Patio"" is also Quad for many players.
""Close"" on arch side mid is Close left and had no name according to players we polled.
""Construction"" was chosen over ruins.
""Spools"" were chosen over spindles or coils. We used Spools to stay consistent with other maps.
""Well""
T-Apartments go through to the kitchen area as well. These are low-action areas and are rarely called.
Separated Kitchen and Library.

**Nuke:**
As stated previously we outlined the very transparent lower routes / bomb site and put them in a key on the bottom left of the full image. The main section of the image holds the upper bomb site.
Locker is underneath the red roof that holds Heaven and Catwalk up.
Red is a general call on ramp, for example ""Catwalk above Toxic"". Do the same for Rafters in Upper. ie. ""Rafters above Hut"", ""Rafters above Mini"".

**Train:**
A1, 5, 6 in 1.6, but are now labelled in GO, and will be 1, 2,3. Some inner trains have been removed in GO,2, 3-Train.
Boilers is also called as ""upper"" but was separated to be more specific.
Up ladder and down ladder can also be ladder room
Pop Dog was a 1.6 name
E-box is also known as Electric.

**Season:** Green and Blue in the A site had different names,,False,self,t5_2r5c3,False,,True

### SPECTATING

- **Resurrected SourceTV as 'GOTV.'**
- Added a map overview that displays players, etc. Can be drawn on in a select-able colored pen when spectating or if the ""sv_competitive_official_5v5"" convar is set to 1 on the server or if the client convar ""mapoverview_allow_client_draw"" is set on the client (drawings are not currently networked to other players).
- Added free camera to spectator modes cycle.
clamped hud_scaling to 0.95.
- Added convar 'cl_spec_show_bindings' that toggles the visibility of the spectator key bindings.
- Added spectator ability to toggle competitive scoreboard player data using the 'drop' command.
- Extended team clan name support to the Team Select Screen. To use team clan name
- After halftime
- Created a server convar that lets you swap the default player side position manually (CTs on right and T's on left) called mp_spec_swapplayersides.
- Made the hotkey that's assigned to jump to a player not change after half-time.
- You can now display a country flag next to your custom team name on the spectator scoreboard by setting ""mp_teamflag_1/2"" to ISO Alpha-2 country code of the country you want to display.
 
### CLASSIC COMPETITIVE 

- Introduced ""Skill Groups""
- Reworked conditions of valid match leaving: A vote to concede becomes available to the team that lost a player. Otherwise the match continues.
- Number of players searching for a competitive match will display number of players compatible with the game type selected by player, and so on.
- Estimated wait time for a competitive match now more accurately displays wait time based on the game type selected by player.

### SERVER ADMINISTRATION

- Added Save/Restore of match state.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file [fileprefix]' -- If set then server will save all played rounds information to files with this prefix. Backup file contains players information like KDA, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades and match score for first and second halves. In a case of a tournament server crash backup file can be loaded using ' mp_backup_restore_load_file'. The default is 'backup'
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_last' -- Every time a backup file is written the value of this convar gets updated to hold the name of the backup file.
    -Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_list_files [number]' -- Lists recent backup round files matching the prefix
   - Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_load_file [filename]' -- Loads the specified backup file and applies players information like KDA, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades; sets the match score for first and second half and starts next round.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_pattern
- Whitelisted 'mp_logdetail' convar.
- Added convar 'sv_damage_print_enable'
- Added 'cl_bobcycle' to 'sv_competitive_minspec'. It's now restricted to the defauklt 0.98 on servers that have 'sv_competitive_minspec' enabled.
- Made all server cash_ convars notify players when they are changed.
- Servers running with sv_pausable 1 will now correctly display 'server paused' UI element on clients when server is paused using 'pause' command.
- Added mp_spectators_max convar to control how many spectators are allowed in a match.
- Added convar mp_halftime_pausetimer that will indefinitely pause the halftime timer.
- Added convar mp_warmup_pausetimer that will pause the warmup period indefinitely. 
 * Warmup periods shorter than 6 seconds cannot be paused.
 
### PERFORMANCE

- Performance improvements for users running on AMD systems.
- Fixed a major performance problem for users running Bitdefender antivirus software.
 
### BUG FIXES

- Fixed two crashes that could happen if you were on a team and went to spectator team.

- Fixed avatar scaling issues on the spectator hud as well as the issues that would place the player slot avatars offset some distance from where they should be.
- Made some adjustments to the specttor UI and regular hud to account for hud_scaling set really high.

http://cstrikedb.info/wiki/Counter-Strike_Database This one has a bit more information but could use more.

It would be nice if there was a Wiki that also covered the competitive history of CS

It would also be nice if along with the patch notes for each beta, development information).

There could also be a section for strategies

Many old sites that were part of the community CAL / CSNation are now defunct so it is more difficult to find this old information. (apart from using Internet Archive).

I guess if something like this does not exist I would like to see if there is community interest in creating one or would it be worth contributing to one of the existing wikis? Perhaps a wiki isn't even the best option?

To start, and even as an adult who's played since high school, I can't stand some of the people in the community who feel like the facade of in-game anonimity is enough to justify shit-talking.


The last competitive match a friend and I were assigned, had a quick finger for the Scout, could do a lot of damage when taking point on a narrow rush, but had a particular nature for shit-talking.  My friend (a 30-something married guy with two kids), who plays CS competitive matches on occasion with myself and a few others, had a few bad save rounds during a low spot of the match.  Dear Chu decided he was going to use this opportunity to pick on my friend (paraphraseds):


""Fuck you, you piece of shit.""


I don't know what it was about his tone of voice, but this guy... he had shit-talking down to an art form.  And the racism didn't help much either.  He sounded at least 15-18 years old, and wouldn't shut the hell up.


Later into the match, the fucker decides to--in the last round--start spamming all-chat with the positions of our teammates, causing us to lose 14-16.  He then boldly claims to the other team that he had to put up with a bunch of shitty players.  We all told him to go fuck himself, and he (once more) told us to kill ourselves.


I know it's the internet, because most of you guys are fairly level-headed--it just seems like this guy was the ultimate example of why a lot of gamers know Counter-Strike for its unforgiving mechanics and its fair share of assholes like Chu.

I just renamed the 'SK Gaming 1on1' feature to 'Grilled' when I joined Team Acer, in case they decided to continue the feature after my departure.

**Phase 2 - [May 2010 - January 2012]**
===========
Prior to that I took over the 1on1 feature

When Carmac and TheSlaSH, and the emphasis was to bring you the person outside of the server/game, their real life more than their gaming career.  I'd already done some long interviews before I took over the feature, so I gradually moulded it into the kind of feature 'Grilled' is now, doing longer interviews and going into great depth about people's careers.

While it's not a major issue

Hidden scores were recently introduced as an option for subreddits to enable. How it works is that any new posts will not allow scores to be viewed until some time after posting. The feedback so far has been great and many moderators of much larger subreddits are seeing desirable effects after enabling it.

* The third round can either be: CT's with M4's VS T's with AK's (CT wins 2nd) **OR** CT's on eco round/Famas' vs T's with AK's (CT loses 2nd)

1353004993.0,1393bm,My change list to competitive mode CS:[GO],manikfox,22,4,9,"I have a list of things that I think should be changed to the competitive rotation in CS:GO:

1. Warm up should allow buying of weapons for the entire warm up time.  It doesn't make sense to say its been 45 seconds and you cannot buy any more weapons in warm up.

2. Allow the ability to only search for certain maps in the competitive pool when looking for a game.  I played de_dust1 last night 4 times in a row and it's not even a balanced map.   Why not let me choose to play a combination of dust2

3.  Allow community maps to be tested and eventually added to the rotation for more map choices.  This would promote more map makers to make CS:GO maps, and if enough players vote it in game to be part of the rotation, it will be part of the rotation.

4.  Have more direct documentation on how a player ranks in their ELO rating.  Is it just on amount of rounds/games won, but you can still get banned for leaving early?

5.  Sometimes killing your team mate is acceptable at the start of round.  A very common example is dust2 where the Terrorists are picking mid and one of their team mates passes in front as the awper shoots.  A second example is a team of friends who really wouldn't care being killed or not at the start of the round and are just fooling around.

6.  As to #3, to include more balances to even out both halves.

7. While I wait for a match

8. Push to talk in friend pre-game waiting for a match.",self,t5_2r5c3,1353037937.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/1393bm/my_change_list_to_competitive_mode_csgo/

So me and a couple of guys are working on a community driven project to help prevent hacking. Project is simple; a server utility that would centralize the ban lists. Also

As VAC is a good anti-cheat

Would you take time to report a hacker?

**Image caption posts**

This issue has come up several times and is quite controversial in several subreddits. Should they be allowed? This isn't r/pics

However

**Spam?**

When is it spam? Is it never spam? Is it spam if it's a very low quality site covered in ads? Is it spam if the person who submitted it appears to be affiliated with the site?

**Sidebar**

Thus far I've added several community groups and servers to the sidebar (anyone who has asked) ----&gt;

At what point will this become overwhelming or useless? Should there be any criteria for who gets added? The sidebar isn't exactly an ideal server browser. Should we just link to a self-post or something that can contain more details?

Very interesting interview on HeatoN's part since he is a CS legend. Heaton had many good points about what is needed in order for CS:GO to become as competitive as it used to be

2 main things he wants to see changed:
1. Get rid of bullet tagging [Seeing bullets in the air]
2. Louder

He feels there is potential of seeing CS:GO become the new Counter-strike for eSports, Street fighter). But in order to accomplish this it will take a combination of effort from Valve, the players, and the community. Not to mention NiP (Ninjas in Pyjamas) WILL be playing CS:GO, which is a huge plus in my eyes.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MnjwUFrloc&amp;t=1m8s

I have 2 very ambitious projects left that I want to finish but often lack the motivation because surfing is for the most part dead. Well to be honest

The first one, with just some minor bug fixes on the very last level.

The second is a freestyle map on the top

You can see screenshots of both maps here: http://imgur.com/a/C5I4B

So who still surfs and would they be interested in the maps being finished?

No of Players: 16
Type: Single Elimination

Description:
Hello and welcome all to Darkened Alliance's 4th annual tournament! We wanted to try and get a tournament started up in January

This will be a Player VS Player Single Elimination (1 Loss and you're out!) tournament in Counter-Strike: Source, you can pick up a version of de_westwood off gamebanana to get a feel for it or hop in our Tavern (pub) server and nominate the modified version (de_westwood_phar) it to give it a shot.

The rules are really simple. 2 players will enter the designated server at the time their matches begin. A brief introduction will follow with the commentators and the match will begin. First up is a knife round. The winner of the knife round gets to pick the beginning team. After this, a sudden death round is played with 16k$ and 2:00 minute round time (3 second freeze time).

Hacks and cheats are obviously not permitted and we hold to right to disqualify anyone suspected of hacking or cheating without giving a reason. Also

There will be a total of 16 players, TX USA.

The tournament will be managed via the Drknd Allinc TeamSpeak (if you don't have TeamSpeak download it from www.teamspeak.com)

1st Place will receive 50$USD

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the tournament



HOST: [DA] Phar

**Good day to you

It has long been my strategy to let this subreddit essentially run itself. In fact

I suspect we're about to see an influx of new users--in fact we already are--so I'm going to ask you to run this subreddit even more by asking for your suggestions on potential rules and your assistance in moderation.

**Aww

So far this August /r/CounterStrike has had more visitors, and posts than any month in history.

July: 300 unique visitors per day, 10 new subscribers per day.    
This week: 3,000 page views per day, 80-150 new subscribers per day.

I'm sure this will drop-off some... Well

**Suggestions?**

Today, or [GO] for example, to tip readers off about which game that submission refers to.

I don't think I'll make it a *requirement* (at least not at this time) but I think it would be a good suggestion because not everyone is interested in all the versions. You'll see more about that in the coming days

Does anyone else have suggestions? Rule ideas? Leave it up to self-government like in the past? Don't worry

**Taking fire

I'm the only mod. I used to be unemployed and watching the spam filter 24 hours a day and responding to the 1 message every couple of months was no problem. However

Do you have mod experience

Helping is pretty easy

If you're interested please ~~[fill this out](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGFvMmlzUW1VOEFPbWN4WUJuc1llYmc6MQ#gid=0)~~ so I can help keep things organized in one place. Please include details about why you're qualified, etc.

Also what are some newer features that you enjoy?,Leonard_Laney,13,0,45,"I really miss the way the AWP used to work before they updated it in 1.6. They basically doubled the delay time that dictates how soon you can shoot the AWP after you've equipped it. I understand why they did it but it was just a lot more fun.

I also really miss the gameplay from 1.3. The delay times for all the weapons were much shorter so as soon as you pulled out a weapon a split second later you shoot it. Also pistols and SMGs were relatively accurate in mid air and you could bunny hop without being slowed down while landing. 

And I miss the animation bugs some of the weapon models had. For instance: if you rapidly switched between the deagle and the AWP the equip animations would stop playing.

One of the newer features I like was the update of the terrorist auto sniper. They turned it into the ultimate noob cannon. They made it stronger,,False,self,t5_2r5c3,False,,True

However, but it means that the amount of items you are able to wishlist will be tiny until more inventories are parsed on-site. If you haven't got anything better to do it'd be nice if you could go through other people's backpacks on the site so the wishlist library fills faster.

Another thing - if you're completely uninterested in TF2 or other games (like I expect a lot of you to be)

This is concept I've had in my head for years. I crudely drew it out. I was hoping to get some general feedback and possibly find a map maker. Thanks for the gander.

Notes:

1. The 1's and 2's on the boxes represent the height: waist high vs. head height.

2. The ""rocks"" area is meant to be a death plunge and the terribly represented waterfall leads to this death. I'll need to have the rocks accessible in case of a bomb drop in the area.

3. The window in the bombsite barn is meant to link to the bombsite near the boat if the jump is long enough. This should be the only access from left and right upper shelves.

4. The water is only meant to be waist high in all areas. The submerged aqua object in the waterslide is an option sniper spot.

5. The map itself is not meant to be very large or complicated. I want to keep the spawn points simple to resist spawn camping (trees don't provide real cover). I want the points of conflict to be mid range and the long range areas being mostly for moving to a position. The interior areas are to be kept very simple. All of this is to keep movement very fluid and unique concepts are to allow for escape and flanking in all areas (benefiting quick thinkers and higher odds of clutch situations).",self,t5_2r5c3,1361364292.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/counterstrike/comments/18ca41/golooking_for_map_maker_for_hire/
