1357666134.0,166xyu,"Ever had one of those friends who occasionally does things so stupid that it's worth being their friend just to see what happens next? Turns out, that's me.",thekadeshi,578,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/166xyu/ever_had_one_of_those_friends_who_occasionally/, that's part of life. But this morning I managed to transcend the ordinary supidity levels and approach darwin-award-esque levels of imbicilitude. Let me begin by calling to mind a glorious mental image: shirtless Tom Selleck. That'll be important in a minute, but my chest very well could be.

Now, headphones and other such paraphernalia. As it turns out one of the best ways you can enhance your enjoyment of music, especially in small rooms, is to apply ""room treatments."" This consists of, among other things, putting up some sound-dampening foam on key areas of the reflective surfaces. In the case of my new little New York bedroom, literally every surface in the room is reflective, I also purchased a few 2'x4' pieces of sound dampening foam. This stuff is actually quite difficult to put anywhere if you want to be able to remove it later. I tried nails, foaming adhesive: http://www.auralex.com/acoustic_adhesive_foamtak/acoustic_adhesive_foamtak.asp I have no doubt that I'm going to have to sand and repaint the sections of drywall i'm putting this stuff on
  
One thing about the new apartment is that A - I can't turn the (free) heat off and B - there is a lot of road noise from the street below. Because of (A) I have to keep my window open at night or I wake up in an oven, being the resourceful fella I am, I applied the spray on stuff to the back of the foam panel, put a stepladder on top of a coffee table (my brilliance begins to show) and carefully stuck the panel to the ceiling. Job well done.  
  
Right up until this morning
  
This is where it gets good. Because now, this stuff is one of those products that's got some pretty exotic chemicals in it, and it says right there in big letters WARNING: USE ONLY IN WELL-VENTILATED AREAS and WASH IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTACT WITH SKIN. But whatever, I know what I'm doing. It's 7am and I just got 3 hours of sleep, all I want to do is spray the ceiling and re-stick my panel so it doesn't fall off today. So I grab the can, hold back the foam, and spray away
  
As expected, forms a thick bubbly rope of scary ass superglue above my stupid head, and, like a bad porno movie, falls directly onto me. And me, being the Max Level Genius I am, am not wearing a shirt. Still have that image of shirtless Selleck in your head? Good.  
  
So the first reaction in these sorts of situations is instinctive - Get This Crap Off, grab a paper towel, and try to grab/wipe this stuff off, because it isn't actually in contact with my skin yet. Ever accidentally get gum in your hair and grab it too fast so it spreads to other hair? Or smoosh a piece of duct tape to your arm by accident? So this is kinda like that. Only it is uber-tacky-mega-glue that's already been drying for 20 seconds, so of course spreading it out instantly dries it. Which isn't the most comfortable thing in the world. So now, slightly high from the fumes of the adhesive, I read the label: WASH IMMEDIATELY WITH SOAP AND WATER. Sure, to the shower! I was headed there anyway. I got this.  
  
Nope. That crap dries fast and is incredibly not water soluble. Reaction no.2 is ""okay, I got the liquid stuff, not the citrus-based gel, which the store was out of. Yes, it's the little yellow bottle of organic chemical stuff that says WARNING USE IN WELL VENTILATED AREA MAY CAUSE HEADACHES. EYE IRRITANT. SKIN IRRITANT. But whatever, I'd rather have an itchy rash for a day than a bulletproof mat of hair glued to my manboob which makes it diffuclt to raise my arms for the next four weeks. 
  
But what follows is truly spectacular. Because whatever this adhesive is and whatever this flavor of Goo Gone is, but not remove it. And thus, instantly-superglued chest hair coverage has increased by a factor of 3 while I'm standing in the shower. Fuck.  
  
At this point, and trying to operate my laptop with fingers covered in fuzz from my towel, because the adhesive has now spread to my hands and become tacky everywhere and I had to dry off somehow. C'mon, google, don't let me down... Rubbing alcohol and/or nail polish! Acetone! To the hardware store v2.0! 10 minutes and $3.00 later and i'm in the shower again getting a nose full of acetone-based nail polish remover.  
  
Weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaand it doesn't work.  
  
So now I'm a little high, with two hands that look like I've worked in a blue towel factory since I was 10 and with a massive, manly chestful of hair firmly glued onto my skin and slowly drying. Feels a bit like a bad sunburn, especially since the Goo Gone made me itch. Pro Tip: Read labels and warnings and removal instructions BEFORE you start using products that could end up on your skin. Or maybe wear a shirt when dealing with extremely flammable, toxic chemicals.  
  
Thankfully in my impaired state - the acetone isn't doing me any favors - I finally manage to recall specifically asking the guy who sold me the adhesive what would get it off. He had said something about citrus-based cleaners. Well, bikini-wax style, but a nice long agonizing chest rub full of dish soap ends up saving most of my skin. And man-rug. But not what they call in the matrix my residual self-image.  
  
TL;DR A shirtless sleep-deprived moron superglues his chest hair while standing on a stepladder on top of a coffee table in front of an open 4th story window

**Part 1: Digital Media**
Source players: iPhone, Zune, Android device, Mac, PC, etc. 

First, consider using your PC or Mac as your main source (but know that your computer will have to be on every time you want to listen to something). 

[This   post is a good place to start](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/v6pix/apple_users_are_audiophiles_too_and_we_care_a_lot/)
With some advice from /u/Uncle_Erik
&gt;Don't get hung up on portable sources and using an iPad. First
What you want to do is run your Mac

Or

* In what format do I want my audio?

From /u/Uncle_Erik 

&gt;Don't bother with AAC in any form. Use ALAC

Counterpoint to Uncle_Erik's comment from /u/Aver

&gt;This is very subjective. Many people
Also, and becomes transparent at lower bitrates than MP3, and in that respect, Opus is actually superior to either, but suffers from a resampler that is sometimes audibly different (Opus converts everything to 48 Khz on encoding)

**Part 1a: How do I get my audio from my PC, iPhone, Android, etc to my power source (receiver, amplifier)?** 

* Streaming Devices:

The digital information that is your music can be sent wirelessly to a device

From Uncle_Erik

&gt;An AppleTV or Airport Express both have optical audio out and will give you bit-perfect optical out. That’s as good as it gets. 

From /u/Arve

&gt;in audiophilia this is much preferred

The optical audio out is sent through the 3.5mm jack - you’ll need an adaptor [like this](http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-Digital-Optical-Audio-TosLink/dp/B001ZU3G2I/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360953300&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=apple+tv+optical+audio+cable) to connect to 3.5mm to digital optical cable. 

The advice above references Apple products in response to question about Apple products

Here are some other devices to stream audio from your PC

[Sonos](http://www.sonos.com/)

[Logitech Squeezebox Touch](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-930-000090-Squeezebox-Touch/dp/B002LARRDA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344571403&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=logitech+squeezebox)

* Line Out

Or, or iPod. 

The idea is to bypass the DAC of the portable device because typically they aren’t well made and audio quality will suffer. 

**Part 1b: Digital to Analog Converters (DACs)**

You've got your storage device


Receivers and the iPhone, Zune, Mac, and PC all have Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) chips that convert your music from digital bits to an analog signal so you can hear it. This built-in DAC is okay, but it is better to use a separate DAC component (like an Airport Express) or the DAC on your receiver as they are usually a better quality. (I think I copy/pasted this from someone else’s comment or post, but I can’t find the source. If it’s yours please let me know so I can source it)

Quality varies in DAC chips and it is better to use one that is designed for high end audio. Some DACs are portable (for headphones)

For more in-depth explanation on DACs

DACs can be used two ways depending on the setup you want. If you are using headphones

Here are some often recommended budget DACs

* Budget:
[Behringer UCA202](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360954560&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=behringer+uca202)
from /u/Aver
&gt;While it's probably a fine DAC if you have onboard audio or a bad laptop

* Entry Level:
[ODAC](http://www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=46)  and Focusrite 2i2/2i4/8i6 (link anyone?)
&gt;This is a fine DAC, causing noise on the output. In addition to the ones you suggested, I'd also like to add the Focusrite 2i2/2i4/8i6 - yes, they are audio interfaces aimed at musicians, but the DAC is on-par with the O2, but offers a very handy feature for anyone connecting to studio monitors or power amps: Volume control. (The 2i2 can be found for $109 through Google shopping)

* DACS and sound cards
*Need additional input/research*


**Part 2: CD Players**

*Need additional input/research*

**Part 3: Vinyl**

Check out /r/vinyl and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/fiedy/my_attempt_at_creating_a_guide_to_vinyl_to_answer/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/xs9yh/baller_on_a_budget_the_cheap_setup_thread/) guide. 

**Part 4: Receivers and Amplifiers**

There are two ways to power the audio that is sent to your speakers. A receiver is the simplest and probably the most affordable method. The receiver typically has a tuner, and an amplifier. 

It is important to note if you plan on buying a turntable, or can be purchased as a separate piece of equipment. 

Simply put, a receiver is a good place to start. 

As with the DAC

A preamp and amplifier are often used for higher-end setups. A dedicated preamp allows you to select the audio source (digital

The amplifier takes the source provided by the preamp

If you’re starting out on a tight budget, and try to buy used to save money. 

* On using home cinema receivers:

From /u/Arve
&gt;All modern home cinema receivers are fully capable of outputting a 2.0 signal to just the front speakers. However

and

&gt;But, which is a device which typically has five power amplifiers, one for each of the channels in a surround set up, and either a line out for a subwoofer, or a separate power amplifier for the sub. In addition, the home cinema receiver has the radio, as I established by the term ""receiver"", plus analog video inputs/outputs.
Which brings me to why I say ""stay with stereo"". All of these components cost money to make, inductors and transformers involved in the power amplification stage is expensive to make. If you want to make it cheap, you end up with an amplifier that's starved for power and finesse.
Also, it's not something you need if you just want to amplify sound from a computer source or gaming console, I'd say ""stick with an integrated amp"", just make sure that it has enough analog inputs to handle the equipment you're hooking up to it: One input from your TV, one from your computer


* If you have some money to shop around for a used 2.0 receiver:

From /u/Uncle_Erik

&gt;First, Adcom, and Marantz. Do not be afraid of used/vintage ones. These can hold up for years and are worth repairing. You can find a lot of them at Audiogon and sometimes they turn up on Craigslist.

* How much power do you need? 

From /u/Uncle_Erik

&gt;Anything that puts out 20W or better should be fine. This isn't the time to get into how much power the typical speaker uses

[Here are the pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/I2frf)  Please forgive the crappy cell phone shots.  I never claimed to be a photographer.

The speakers are made by Earthquake Sound.  Earthquake is well known for their insane home theater subwoofers and mobile audio products.  A few years back they made an entry into the high-end speaker market with their $29,500 center channel called the Rhea (pronounced ree-uh).  If you look around there is almost NOTHING written about these speakers, which is a crying shame because they are actually pretty amazing.  The Tethys weigh in at almost 400 lbs gross weight per side and measure 5'x2'x1.5'. The Rhea is about 250 lbs and 3 feet wide.  To say that these speakers are large is an understatement.  

The finish on the lower part of the Tethys is actually 16 layers of steam-bent cherry wood.  The 10 layers of piano black lacquer on the speakers is polished to a mirror finish.  I've heard that paint process takes almost a whole month to complete.  The binding posts on the rear of the speakers are HUGE, 8"" mid bass, two 12"" bass drivers made of silk-laminated pressed-pulp, and a 15"" passive radiator to finish it off.  The Rhea contains three 1.5"" silk dome tweeters and four 6.5"" silk-laminated pressed-pulp mid-range drivers.  Earthquake claims that the Tethys will drive all the way down to 17 hz.

I am not talking any a tiny flaws either. Somewhere in the recent months Parts Express seems to have contracted another manufacturer to build the B652's (probably to better keep up with demand) and in doing so this new manufacturer has learned to redefine the term *We Screwed the Pooch*. I personally bought eight pair of these new 652's. Four in Nov12 and four in Dec12 and left them in my closet (rainy day supply).. My friend in CT also had two new sets from DEC12 and neither one of us took them out of the box to check until this week. His experiences were similar to mine but less dramatic.

..... Have you listened? ......

I spent a good deal of time going over the Old Vs New trying to figure out what in the world could cause this catastrophic change and they pretty much changed everything on these speakers since the last revision. EVERYTHING..

[Quick dirty video overview of the visible changes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-XySNgnnQw&amp;hd=1)

The boxes are now slightly (~1/16th) bigger in all dimensions

On the insides the changes aren't any harder to see. The amount of polyfill is about half what it was and the tweeter's capacitor is now 3.3uf 50v versus 3.3uf 100V. The woofer's structure is slightly different with no holes around the suspension metal and a much shinier paint job. The wiring changed too. Instead of parallel from the rear clips to each speaker (cap on terminals) they run the drivers piggy back with the cap on the tweeter and everything is now soldiered instead of using connectors. 

 I did some direct power experimentation wiring the old and new drivers directly to my amplifier and simply trying to pick out what was different via a mono source. The woofer was a very subtle sound signature change. A bit harsher then the old unit. Really just too small of a change to really describe. The tweeter on the other hand was about 40% louder than the old one when wired to a full range signal. Possibly why they used a different capacitor. Putting the old drivers and cap in the new box seemed fine so don't blame that. This is a QC failure

I have removed the links to the daytons from my lists on my subreddit and WILL contact Dayton directly and try to figure out if they even acknowledge this horrible change. I was hoping there would be an easy fix for this but that seems less and less likely.

I have dedicated a good portion of my time pushing these speakers because the originals were worth pushing. I will get to the root of this and see if any fixes can be offered. Sorry if this is posted too late for some. Maybe there are good units out there but I don't think I have any.

Contained within this RAR'd and Zipped archive(for security) are five roughly four minute songs all sourced from verified lossless FLAC. All were chosen for their consistency of tempo and four for the quality of their recordings. The last song was chosen because it is a wonderful example of horrific recording quality
___
* **What did you do to them?**
___


I took these five songs, AAC-192 and MP3-128 Non-joint Stereo (via Goldwave) while the last section remains lossless. The three now compressed parts were again decompressed to WAV and reassembled in Audacity in the correct playback order with the various compressions randomized for YOU (not me). I tried to remove any clicks and pops between sections but some do remain but shouldn't affect the tests.

* **What do you want me to do?**

Play the songs back however you like via headphones, foobar etc. DO NOT RE-ENCODE FOR iTUNES!! and with [THIS ONLINE FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p4d1mbQqNb2uYi-Rz_m4RWRg1OMUvepLSzT5Et6MNro/viewform) fill in 1 thru 4 of what quality you believe each 1 minute section of song represents. 1 being the best, 4 the worst on a scale. Do not pick BEST, WORST or the in-betweens for more then ONE section per song. 

After you have played back all Five songs and filled in your OPINIONS as to what sounds Worst, BEST.. You will be asked for *A* name (anything you want), you must check Speakers or Headphones (or both) as the device used for playback and finally there is an area for a short one line description of your test setup IE:: *1999 Altec Lansing PC speakers* or *Sennheiser HD800's, blessed by VooDoo priests and filled with Magic rocks!*.

___
The results will not be posted until at least 100 people have taken the test. (maybe more depending on how long that takes). Feel free to re-link this post or the form  to ANYONE you think might want to participate.


**MAKE SURE YOU VOTE 1 FOR THE BEST SOUNDING AND 4 FOR THE WORST** My hopes being not this many people like 128mp3 and are just doin' it wrong.

1357322935.0,15ylpx,iTunes 11.0.1 Audio Quality Null Test,thescort,126,13,66,"There has been a lot of chatter on various Apple and Audio forums about the sound quality of iTunes (version 11 and in general)
I figured I'd do some null tests.   
  
here is how I went about it:  
Took a .wav file (Bounced from a multitrack at 24bit/44.1kHz) and loaded into my DAW   
Took the same .wav file and loaded it into iTunes (without converting) (24bit/44.1kHz still, it is two programs referring to the SAME copy.  
  
Using soundflower

**Hypothesis:** There is a difference between the original file
  
**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference between iTunes output and the original file. 

In order to accept our hypothesis

**The result:** *We must reject the hypothesis in favour of the null.* The resulting file was silence. There was no audible or visible audio when the iTunes playback and the original file were combined with inverted phase. This suggests that iTunes was perfectly reproducing the test file. 

[Tracks from top to bottom: Captured iTunes playback; Original wavefile; sum of (inverted) iTunes and Original. ](http://i.imgur.com/cLAlJ)  
   
  
  

[A close up of the Null file with dB scale to left. ](http://i.imgur.com/lhc6R)  
  
Note that at full zoom there is no deviation from the 0 crossing. Looking at the scale to the left we can see that the entire scale represents &lt;1dB so that means if there is any deviation from 0

Worst part was he was a salesperson at a high end audio shop.

Tried to sell me on his service of having him come to my home to ""optimize"" my setup with his golden ears. 

When he hit ""play"" on a CD track

He claimed that ""even his wife"" could hear the difference when he switched cables or when he painted a CD. He played a painted CD in the car (!!) for her and she ""noticed the difference immediately"".

Needless to say

Remembered another one: I tried to point out the law of diminishing returns with audio gear (i.e. at a certain point you end up paying exuberant amounts of money for fractions of a percent of increase in fidelity).  Nope

I'm personally coming to visit this community less and less because of this; any interest in a ""budget audio"" Subreddit? 

**EDIT:** 

Reviewing the comments so far, or just keep posting here, as they are more likely to get advice more quickly. I feel that's flawed thinking, as it would be true with any new community; it will take time and work to support a new budget audio subreddit, and until a sufficient effort has been made to test it's usefulness, mere speculation does next to nothing. 

Other arguments against that I think are valid are the ambiguity of ""budget"", which would not work well in a community of mostly new audio enthusiasts, and being able to encourage people with small budgets to possibly increase their budgets, or seek out different/higher-end gear. 

We couldn't force people with more experience to advise at a budget audio subreddit

Perhaps instead, reading, and consulting with local shops (if possible) could help reduce these posts. I want to help foster a positive community here, where at least not *all* of the posts are: ""Need surround system for dorm parties, LOUD, $50 MAX, can you help?"", which has a cheap build quality

There are *more* than helpful sidebar links

I'm really a fan of the discussion posts when they come up once or twice in a blue moon. Deals are sweet too. But I can only take enough recommendations for budget set ups. 

Also did I mention iTunes is literally hitler? And the Pioneer/Dayton bookshelves are gems. 

I'm not trying to be condescending towards the budget audiophiles either, etc. and listen for yourself** Klipsch speakers are bright, Monitor Audios are warm, and B&amp;Ws sound dead accurate but lifeless. Those terms are entirely subjective and mean nothing over the internet in text so why bother?

I don't even care about the picture albums. They're fun to look at. But the word humble now applies to anything from $10-$5

1372218391.0,1h33pv,The moment the speakers disappeared...,pearljamman010,96,10,28,"So I got bored of all my usual music since I drive 3 hours a day to work and wore a lot of it out.  Lately, Beardfish

My decent setup:

* Carver PM-600 (300 watts x 2 4Ω) amp
* David Hafler DH-110 preamp
* Martin Logan Motion 12 (each 300 watts RMS 4Ω)

I played an old standard (Norah Jones - Nightingale) and arranged my speakers to find the sweet spot.  I found that putting the preamp in Mono mode helped find the center.  The sweet spot was ~2 feet out from the wall

I started with Frou Frou's ""Details"" album and immediately was smiling with the opening track ""Let Go"".  The intro riff bothered me because I knew I had heard it before (turns out Wiz Khalifa sampled it on one of his mix tapes on the song ""In The Cut"").  The electronic beats and acoustic music, her voice projected itself right dead center between the speakers and the reverb made the music pulse in a 3 dimensional field.  The bass is a bit week, so I turned it up (100 hz) about 3-4 dB since I removed the wall reinforcement.  Then I played Psychobabble and the immersion was complete.  The song starts with a hang drum and you can hear and feel the impact of the mallet.  If I didn't know better, I thought I was tripping.  The mixing is INCREDIBLE on this album.  The strings kick in (bass, cello, violins etc) and I could pin point the location of each according to the mix.  By this point, I had a shit eating grin on my face.

Next, as well as what sounds like a cello that the 2 x 6.5"" woofers handled nicely.  Then there is some odd cymbals and creaking sounds that pan back in forth in the middle of the room that completely throw you off your balance.

My **holy shit** moment was when I switched to the ""Speak For Yourself"" album.  The first song ""Headlock"" is so smooth and catchy that a pair of crappy earbuds will make you miss the music.  The intro has some digital percussive instruments that sound similar to a xylophone and had me tapping my foot.  Her voice again

The moment that the speakers and everything else completely left the room and I experienced pseudo synesthesia was during the song ""Have You Got It In You"".  The synth rhythm line and her voice put me in a trance.  Then some ambiance, I can see the width, height and depth of the music.  The tweeters are silky smooth, every triangle and breath comes off the top without a hint of sibilance.  The mid ranges project just enough sound out the back and sides that it creates a virtual surround setup without much cancellation to distract.  The woofers kept up, but material below 50 hz was a bit lacking.  If I could get that bottom octave and some sound dampening, I would never have the urge to upgrade.  I was floored that being 100% sober, I could feel music like this.

**TL;DR**: Get your hands on some lossless versions of Imogen Heaps music to test your system.  Take a few minutes to get your setup in the right position and find a sweet spot (the Motions have a fairly narrow one, it's about loving the music.  I consider myself a rocker, but for enjoying the time and effort that goes into composing, recording, and mixing a great record, this stuff works way better.

These show that in 3 out of the 5 songs FLAC is indeed chosen as the best sounding section. 320 MP3 was chosen best in 2 of the 5 songs and AAC192 somehow barely holds its own against 128 MP3.

The big surprise came with the composition of the overall graph at the bottom that summarized all the results from all the songs and shows exactly as intended that Flac is #1, WE as a people with varying setups and players CAN indeed tell flac from MP3-320, aac192 and MP3-128.

**If you can you give me some more specifics on when these faulty units were sold I can relay them to the community's I frequent . I want to make sure people with perfectly fine speakers don't start asking for refunds and give them a specific date range.**

*Not all of the ""new design"" units are experiencing the low tweeter output issue. There is no specific date range that can be given.  We know that units with the low output tweeter existed in the last arrival in 2012
_____

**How/when would you like me to tell the people who also purchased these speakers that you are willing to do this exchange/refund? I don't think handing every single one of them your personal email would be an effective system ;)  and I want to give at least a rough date estimate as to when then can expect the quality to be back to expected levels.**

*Currently we are out of stock of the B652

_____

So that is all for now. If you purchased the B652's at parts express or on amazon contact parts express and they will replace or refund if you received any of the faulty batches. My advice is ignore the 45 day return window and contact them anyway. Their Customer service is one of the reasons I recommend them so much in the first place.

I will be receiving one of the first pairs of ""fixed""/"" Actual Quality Controlled"" B652's for evaluation and will obviously report back here with my findings. Being a few weeks away from that I recommend anyone who thinks they got a faulty set (and you will know it) contact PE and setup your exchange/replace now.

I have always been picky about sound, and I started dabbling with various mediums, including vinyl and all the various digital formats from the crappiest mp3s to pure WAV files. Before I go on, let me show what I've been listening on:

Polk LSi9's
Parasound Newclassic 2100 and 2125 preamp/amp
MicroPRO 3000
MRT Music Streamer II

It's kind of a ""budget"" audiophile system, and anything past that I honestly can't tell the difference from a CD.

I feel like to be an ""audiophile"" is to pay incredible attention to these kinds of numbers, you aren't doing it right; if you don't buy the best cables, you aren't doing it right. Details like this DO make a difference physically, and I've seen the graphs that show it. I'm not saying there aren't people out there who are genuinely bothered by sound quality defects caused by some of these things. I know lots of people who can't tell the difference between a CD and a 64 kbps mp3, and I know some people who claim they can tell the difference between 320 kbps formats and CD quality formats; we are all somewhere on a hearing scale, and it's all about finding something you are happy with.

But here is the deal. I have been a lurking member of the ""audiophile"" community for a few years now (not just on reddit), but here are two factors that I would like to see people paying more attention to:

1) Room acoustics. In my slightly profession--and certainly my personal--opinion, the TYPE of ceiling, the type of furniture, even the foundation under the floor all make huge differences. Heck, even the position your head is in (XYZ position in the room, direction your head is turned, even your haircut!!) makes a noticeable difference. There are many factors when it comes to room acoustics, the closest things to room acoustics you see people discussing are how to point your speakers.

2) Recording quality. Now, in my mind, when it comes to how the end product sounds. Let's say it was possible for a set of speakers in a set of conditions to PERFECTLY reproduce a track. Well, if the original recordings were crappy, you will hear crap in all it's glorious definition. I find myself reading post after post about buying expensive equipment that can improve some minute quality of the reproduction, but very rarely do I come across a post that gives links to quality recordings. I'm not talking the bit rate of the recordings here, I'm talking about the original recordings taken. Personally I listen to a lot of classical music, which I can't change at all. Because of this, closing my eyes, but that's why you go see your favorites live

Don't get me wrong, a love of looking for the best, or because the irritation and frustration of sound quality drives you to keep looking. I'm not saying we should STOP talking about the little (albeit often expensive) details. I do think, however, when it comes to the actual listening experience, we are very quick to buy thousands of dollars of equipment that will make the sound better, when in reality moving the coffee table would make a bigger difference.

I was in the market for a new reciever.  I new all I wanted was great processing and amplification and the ability to do DTS-MA over HDMI.  Now just about every receiver on the market these days can do HDMI, and I also don't really care much from the streaming apps most new receivers come with these days, so I threw those out the window as well.   This led me to a used listing on Amazon for a [Denon 4308](http://www.hometheater.com/content/denon-avr-4308ci-av-receiver). 

This is a machine that when released was a $2400 behemoth.  How much did I pay?  $400.  I can guarantee you right now you cannot find anything new at even twice that price that will be able to touch this bad boy.

Years passed, got convinced I could have had better stuff for reasonable price.

Remembering my father's passion about music, but not quite.

I decided to get my father's audio system back on working. Marantz Imperial 7 speakers, and my senns HD 25 (the Koss did not survive time).

I thought my mac was enough to drive my senns. I though come on, I though I wouldn't appreciate the difference.

Found an old vinyl by Jethro Tull, lossless.

What could ever be the difference

I am currently listening to My God

Fuck, there's nothing but some sound in here, where the fuck is the life that blew my ears and brains a few minutes ago. Where is the detail of the drums, the perfect vibrant voice of the choir, the strings that keep vibrating and shakes you to the bones. 

It's not even the same thing. I could never have imagined such an abyss could exist between the two sources. Believe me, never kept my breath as long and hard as I am doing now listening to *Locomotive breath*.

I was lucky, for free. Now I know I can trust them, now I know what a difference the source can make, I see the importance of amplification, and precise output.

First off

But I just feel like this subreddit is getting a LOT of repetitive and generic posts. 

I don't want to scare away new members, on a budget. What turntable should I buy? What headphones should I buy? (All too many of these posts should be posted to /r/headphones. But I have to pick my battles). What desktop 2.1 system do I buy? What kind of speakers are these? (GOOGLE!)

I don't mean to come off as a prick. Everybody around here is incredibly helpful. I mean our community is *rapidly* growing. And I strongly believe this to be because of the helpfulness of everybody around here. 

As I type this I feel like my main point is becoming more and more muddled. But I feel like there needs to be more distinction between what subreddits these posts should go in.

The house was way out in the outer edge of the city... He was selling the house and moving so google immediately showed me an MLS listing for 170k for the house.  Not a fancy house and not in a great neighborhood

I walk in the place with the guy and immediately to the left is the most insane audiophile setup I've seen in someones house.  I immediately noticed 2 1.2kw McIntosh monoblocks on stands next to a rack of insanely high end gear (Esoteric cd player, but could tell they were special.  He also had a pair of HD800s on a stand and a Woo Audio tube amp sitting on top of the rack.  I took note, and followed him into the room with the chairs.  Sitting on the chairs when I sat down was a Meridian controller and in front of the chairs near the wall was a pair of smaller Meridian speakers (DSP5200).  There was an empty TV stand (obviously the TV had been sold or moved) so this was definitely a bedroom turned media room.  (I later found out he had DSP8000s as the fronts that he recently sold after I mentioned I saw a pair of the bigger ones on CL that he said were his). 

We quickly discuss the chairs and I hand him some cash.  Before moving them I say ""so... I noticed your McIntosh audio setup in the other room

Anyway... he cranks on some nice Audiophile type Jazz on SACD and I get closer to the speakers to inspect what they are.  They're MBL 111F hybrids.  I had seen the bigger MBL products in videos and such before, tight punchy bass, vocal perfection, imaging like I've only heard from electrostats, and the ease of reproduction like I've never heard.  They just seemed willing to reproduce whatever you asked. 

My brother in-law who was helping me move the furniture... one of the most frugal (and non audiophile) people I've ever met (one who mocks my even remotely high end purchases) made a comment when we got back to my house that sorta put some perspective on it.  He said to my wife, and the singer was right in front of them.""

Normally I don't even bother looking because people are usually just trying to dump junk, but I was a few blocks from home

I was tempted to yank him out of his car and try to finagle the speakers in his place, but as I turned the corner, I saw them there.  Jumped out as fast as possible and threw them in the back of my 4Runner.

I got them home, but as soon as I turned them on, I could tell they were in perfect condition.  Haven't a chance to really drive them hard yet to see what they can do, hopefully will be able to play with them a bit tonight.  Not sure if they will replace the JBL's or just be used in a secondary system, but I am pretty happy.

And just in time for the new Laura Marling album :) 

Upgrading from a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (acrylic platter, balanced bass, and sparkling, airy highs. Still under 10 hours of break in and I'm hoping it doesn't change character much.

Was torn between this and the VPI Scout- decided to save at least a few dollars and hope it would be enough of an upgrade to justify it- so far so good. Running to a Pro-Ject Phono Box S to a Peachtree Decco 65 to Frugal Horns. 

I've always been an enjoyer of vinyl for the physical medium aspect- but never had the equipment to necessarily rival the overall accuracy of sound of my digital collection- I probably play 80/20 digital/analog. I finally feel that I'm enjoying the sound of vinyl more than digital- the records will definitely be narrowing or even overtaking that 80/20 gap in the future.

Things I have noticed in vintage gear vs modern equipment (obviously specific observations

* Speaker cabinets seem to be much smaller these days
* Number of speakers per cabinet seems to have been reduced on average.
* Speaker sizes have changed from 12-15 inch woofers in a cabinet with mid and high speakers
* Speaker design, voice coil size, etc. change with new technology, I know. But *why* specifically is it that such changes have taken place?
* Amplifiers seem to have much more power on average (both rated and actual) than they used to. Vintage amp with 15 watts per channel drives large vintage speakers as loud as I could want
* Anything else others have noticed over time?

Obviously, but contextually and musically why trends exist the way they do, and what those trends actually are? What things shaped the development of audio equipment 40 years ago? What things shape it today?

I was just in a Starbucks getting a monday afternoon pick-me-up.

The guy in front of me was dressed in classic style: American Eagle jeans, and Beats classic headphones around the neck. Before this turns into a Beats-bashing thread, let me just say we all know better already, and for this guy maybe it fit his style. To each their own.

When he got up to the register, they're pretty great. Really expensive but I think they're the best."" Misinformed, etc, but that's expected. Whatever, it was just smalltalk.

When I ordered my coffee the Beats guy had already left, there are lots of cheaper options that are even better. Started discussing a few brands, Sennheiser, AKG, etc. The guy knew what he was talking about. He said ""yeah I really just want something that's not Apple"" and ""I don't know if I want a studio sound.""

Now here's the fun part. Before I could even mention it he said

So, asking you to compare a file bought from HDTracks and the same file, from the same album, but bought in the iTunes Music Store.

Well, and some subreddits less focused on audiophile things, but mostly to groups with an interest in music. (/r/samplesize being the exception).

I let the survey run until I was down to less than a handful of responses daily

Well, and I freely admit this is to tease you a bit, I'm going to do the demographics:

## System types

It seems that redditors, and that a majority of the headphone users stick to closed on- or over ear headphones.

|  System type  | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Headphones    |92     |67%         |
| Loudspeakers  |46     |33%         |

The full breakdown can be seen in [this chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/system_types.png)

## System cost

It also seems that redditors overwhelmingly do this audio thing on a tight budget

|  System cost  | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
|$0 - $250      |64     |48%         |
|$250 - $500    |33     |25%         |
|$500 - $1000   |21     |16%         |
|\&gt;$1000        |16     |12%         |

(Again: A [pie chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/system_cost.png))

## The results

Well

And ... here is what you answered:

|  Preference   | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Clip A        |71     |51%         |
| Clip B        |35     |25%         |
| No preference |32     |23%         |

(And in a [pretty pie chart](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/prefered_clip.png))

So, you would expect the distribution of responses to be relatively uniform between A, B and ""No preference"", perhaps tilted towards ""No preference"", since that would imply people couldn't tell the difference.  In this case, though, the distribution isn't uniform, with some numbers

&gt; To determine if respondents have a preference between the three options we perform a simple goodness of fit test. This tells us how likely it is that our final distribution would occur given random choosing. The answer is that it would be very unlikely, which is the opposite of what our distribution shows.

Now, and simply look at the A vs B, we are left with the following distribution:

|  Preference   | Count | Percentage |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| Clip A        |71     |67%         |
| Clip B        |35     |33%         |

(And if you prefer pie charts

And, is the result pure chance or not - did those responding to the survey and choosing A or B make some sort of informed decision, or did they decide by a simple coin flip.  Again, I'm going to quote superapplekid - since he formulated this much better than I could:

&gt; Looking at only the responders who had a preference we can test to see if they preferred Clip A over Clip B by treating the choice as a binomial random variable, meaning we reject it and instead claim that responders who had a preference preferred Clip A over Clip B. While 70% of responders who had a preference preferred Clip A, the possible lower bound due to sampling error (95% confidence interval) would still be non-random at 58% having a preference for Clip A.

In other words: **We can with reasonable certainty conclude that there are audible differences between the two clips

We can also then say with the same reasonable certainty that people, indeed Clip A.

I have usually used iTunes in the past for its simplicity

I have *always* been attracted to Zune software's functionality of the interface. All the artists, Zune doesn't exist on Mac, and Zune doesn't auto-grab album artwork as nicely. I'm not a fan of the color scheme, either.

So I use iTunes. It gets the job done. I set the view-mode to ""Grid""

**Then the update came along...**

...and I love it.

[Look, the songs and albums are smushed together, just the way I like.

[And look, and it'll look *awesome* for them.

Genres are organized just like Artists

Songs is pretty similar to how it looked in the past - a bunch of songs all lined up in whatever order you chose. No picture needed there

**""Okay

YES. There's one thing I left out about my ""Things I like about Zune"" mini-list. ""Now-Playing"". The ability to add songs to the ""now playing"" list on the fly. This is literally my most missed feature from when I had a Zune HD. Zune's desktop software could do it

[But now it can.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1bt5j5XE-s&amp;feature=youtu.be) That's a somewhat laugh-worthy video I just made of it in action. Unfortunately, so that video will be ""processing"" for a while. ~400mb of video takes a long time at 70kbps up...

Basically, you can also add individual tracks to the Up Next list, I just forgot to do that in the video. Right click a song to add it.*

If I find anything else noteworthy, and will be recommending for friends to make the update.

EDIT 1: You don't have to right-click a song to add it. When you hover over a song or have it selected, [you'll be able to add them all at once by clicking any of those arrows.](http://i.imgur.com/Bu4eJ.png)

Also, at least), many of us have got to use iTunes. Boom. Relevant.

Any questions? If someone's at work or something and can't install iTunes but wants to know a little more

On my own stereo I can't tell the difference between V0, but I could easily tell the difference between V0 on my stereo and lossless files being played through the Naim. I can usually catch 192 kB/s vs V0, and I can always tell the difference between 128 kB/s and V0. However, this made me wonder why we cap MP3s at 320kbps. **Why is there no in-between bitrate, if .wav files are ~2000+ kB/s why is there no midway 640 kB/s mp3?** I couldn't find any relevant information on Google. Format limitation? Arbitrary decision? I can't tell the difference between V0 and 320 kB/s but I bet I could differentiate V0 and 640 kB/s, were such a thing to exist.

* First Aid Kit - The Lion's Roar

Metal

Classical

* Yo-Yo Ma

* Benjamin Grosvenor - Rhapsody in Blue: Saint-Saens

* Hilary Hahn - Silfra

* Make sure all sound effects are disabled

* Open quicktime, Quicktime preferences, audio tab Then select Windows Audio Session, this is also known as WASAPI. This by-passes the windows sound mixer.

* Finally open iTunes and deselect all enhancing options

* Make sure the iTunes volume slider is at maximum and presto! bit-perfect!


You can only test this if you have an AV Receiver or processor and 24 bit dac. Simply play a dolby digital recording.

There's a lot of misinformation on the internet claiming that other players like Foobar 2k are much better sounding than iTunes which just isn't true

He was an electrical engineering student, Marantz receiver (like the ones you all drool over), L/R speakers hanging out in the middle of the living room (that's how it appeared to me at the time), and a ""subwoofer"" (I thought, ""what the hell is that?"").  The whole system was shelved in a built-in wall unit that he constructed himself, and he set up a dedicated power line for the system and everything.

He musta spent close to $5000 for it (I'm talking early 80s)

He wound up making his own phono pre-amp for his electrical engineering senior project.  He even used tubes!  I remember how he boasted that the parts cost him $300, then shunted the phono signal to his preamp, and it was like the music *came alive!*

I wound up spending whole summers in his living room trying to make mix tapes(!) with best-quality cassettes.

**Edit 2:** I have started a second survey that avoids the flaw of this first test. The new survey is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1ez3qe/survey_highres_vs_lossy_the_reboot/)

Well

Can you hear the difference between a 24/88.2 ""Studio master"" lossless edition of a song

This is something I said I would do in the [thread about the HDTracks version of ""Random Access Memories""](http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/1et48i/daft_punks_ram_from_hd_tracks_2488_version/).  Note that it took me some time from when I first decided that I wanted to test, I had to search for a candidate clip of about 30 seconds, and I also wanted to find the right candidate, which took about 50 complete listens of the album.

I've prepared two clips of the intro to ""Lose Yourself to Dance"":

1. One from the [high-res version you can buy on HDTracks or Qobuz](http://www.discogs.com/Daft-Punk-Random-Access-Memories-%C3%89dition-Studio-Masters/release/4581717). This file is originally in 24/88 format
2. … and one from the Mastered for iTunes version

I've then prepared a Google survey that basically seeks the answer to one question: ""Which clip do you prefer, and your system settings. Note that you should only fill in the survey once.

* [Google survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BVXFR4FLdKw8KpB6vPu2g5c5dcxfK8nwTpCsNt7GWQM/viewform)
* [Test files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i15jzh46pza5nip/lossy-vs-lossless.zip) (25.5 MB zip) - [Mirror 1](http://media.veven.org/2013/05/lossy-vs-lossless.zip)


I'll keep the survey open until I have a reasonable number of responses, and merely asking you to subjectively tell which clip you prefer - it could take as little as five minutes, or as much time as you personally like to spend on it.

(I'll be crossposting this to a few other audio-related subreddits).

In order to demonstrate just how much mp3s have improved over the years

Now, but it ran **glacially** slow.  Like, it would have taken hours to encode a single song. I eventually found the tweaks that got DosBox running acceptably fast, but in the meantime I got FreeDos up and running in a VirtualBox virtual machine.  Much faster.

The song I chose to encode was ""Discipline"" by Nine Inch Nails.  Before you start throwing things at me

The results are here: https://spideroak.com/browse/share/ygaddy/reddit

You can click on the 'spideroak_public"" folder to see the individual files

~~Now, but it doesn't work on others. For ease of comparison, I transcoded the l3enc output back into flac using ffmpeg. So if the Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.mp3 file doesn't work for you, try the Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.flac file.~~

L3enc needs to be used with its own reference decoder. Distributing the mp3 output of l3enc is thus kind of pointless

I also encoded it with LAME v3.99.5


As for which file is which:  
Discipline.flac - the original  
Discipline_l3enc99a_320k.mp3 -encoded with l3enc at 320kbps  
Discipline_l3enc99a_128k_Reference.flac -encoded with l3enc at 128k
Discipline_lame3995_V5 -encoded with LAME 3.99.5 at V5
~~Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.flac -the l3enc encode converted back to flac~~  
~~Discipline_l3enc99a_128k.mp3 -encoded with l3enc at the default 128k setting~~

I'll entertain suggestions on different codec settings or different audio samples (must be redistributable).

EDIT: Added spectrals

EDIT 2: Ugh.  It seems that for some bitrates

Edit 3: Removed the earlier l3enc 128k stuff. Apology to those who grabbed it before. Added a flac of the 128k l3enc output.

I want to just take a moment to discuss this subreddit and what it's goals and direction should be. This is sort of sparked by some comments I've received here and elsewhere, and see if we can't lead it in the right direction.

First issue: An Audiophile 101/Audio Primer page. I'd say at any given time, but I think a single page where we could point people would be a great thing. 

I'm going to lay out the following sections that I envision off the top of my head

 * Intro to Audio (General Useful Knowledge)
 * Primer on Audio Quality (Overview, etc.)
 * Intro to Speakers
 * Intro to Headphones
 * Digital Audio Playback (Computer/CD/DVD -&gt; Amplifier - covers DACs, etc.)
 * Digital Audio Formats
 * Amplifiers and Receivers
   - Solid State
   - Surround
   - Tubes
 * Headphone Amplifiers (+DACs, etc)
 * Portable Sources (iPod, CD Players, etc.)
 * Vinyl and Phono
 * Cables/Wiring (should contain 1 link to monoprice and general instructions on how to hook things up)
 * Brand/Buyers Guide - 2-3 Recommendations in each above device category at *several* different price points; going for ""If you get this
 * Brands/Products to Avoid - Similar to above, or certain Bose headphones.

Open to discussion,"" or ""How do I hook up my speakers,"" or ""I'm putting together a new system, what amp should I buy?"" I can just point them to one place and give a small amount of customized help, instead of reinventing the wheel every time. I think it could be awesome.

This leads me to the second item: the goal and direction of this subreddit in general. While, what I'd really like to be discussing are some of the more interesting audio quality info: new speaker models, listening tests, DACs, turntable decks and cartridges, great recordings, audio formats, and more advanced audiophile stuff. I know others feel the same way based on some other discussions I've had.

I think we can strike a balance—people new to audio shouldn't be afraid of seeking advice

So what about everyone else? Why are you here? What would you like to see posted and discussed?

Now excuse me while I gather pictures of my new tube amp mods to post... :)

**tl;dr: 1. Would you be interested in helping with/reading an /r/audiophile wiki of collected greatness?  2. What would you like to see from this subreddit?**

\*edit: Progress! calbear81 has made me a mod, so if you see your post didn't go through or got flagged, please notify the mods and I'll be sure to take care of it.

However

I was out, just having moved to NYC, I didn't want to spend too much. I was at a Guitar Center with my roommates, and saw a pair of $30 Sennheisers (Sennheiser HD201). I asked if I could try them out, I plugged them in. Was impressed. They weren't fantastic sounding, but they were better than what I had. Mind you, my higher quality headset (Razer Megalodon, back home at this point.

Anyways, and started listening to music. A few days later, I messed with the equalizer which fixed my major problem with them. They sounded flat. Like there was no variation in the ranges of sound (or so how I thought). The equalization gave them a bit of a kick, but I also heard a few pops in my 320kbps music. I got some FLAC versions of a few of my favorite songs, and listened to them. They sounded by far better than what I was listening to before.

So now, listening. Listening to music like I hadn't listened to it before. My Razer headset? Sitting on the ground.

It is amazing, Monster, Razer). 

I am astounded. I finally see (hear?) clearly now. I want to get more into listening to music now with proper gear. It is amazing. I know that it can only go up from here.

Im not really sure there are other people who feel like this

First of all, but many members of various hifi / audiophile forums who are drinking the vendors / manufacturers koolaid.

I dont believe there is much difference in cables. There might be a minor differences in the materials but thats pretty much it. I dont believe in people being able to hear the difference between two cables from similar material (because as far as ABX testing goes

Same goes for amplifiers. I dont believe that any amplifier is worth more than 3-5k usd max (in majority of the cases its probably way cheaper than that) and I certainly dont think the price difference is worth the audio difference.

And Im totally sick of people coming up with new terms how to describe something thats completely different for every one of us (and is differently perceived) and trying to sound really qualified and educated about it. Yea, with a bit of muffled mids"".

It just feels like the art gallery stuff. You know

As I compare tracks: on vinyl tracks of Californication by RHCP, and overall distortion is higher. That, and I just can't push the volume as high as I could on the digital version.

On top of that, noise increases - this of course can be heard and is quite noticeable when I'm spinning a record.

I have multiple questions about speakers. I've looked around but I can't make sense of most of these things. This is what I HAVE found out on my own. Thanks for stopping by. 

---------------------------

Again

Types of speakers 

* [Active Speakers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_speakers) have an internal amp. Here's a [picture.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Active_loudspeaker.svg/250px-Active_loudspeaker.svg.png). I think most computer speakers have built in amps.
* Passive speakers lack an amp. If you buy passive speakers

Amps- Popular ones mentioned

* Popular ones mentioned: [Dayton](http://www.amazon.com/Dayton-DTA-100a-Class-T-Digital-Amplifier/dp/B004JK8BDK/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322387040&amp;sr=1-9)

* or this cheaper [Lepai](http://www.amazon.com/Lepai-Tripath-TA2020-Class-T-Amplifier/dp/B0049P6OTI/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322387093&amp;sr=1-1)
* [Audio Video Receiver](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-STRDH520-Channel-Receiver-Black/dp/B004NHCGJO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322388901&amp;sr=8-1) or just an [audio receiver](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DH100-2-Channel-Audio-Receiver/dp/B001TP3CH8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322388710&amp;sr=8-1)- I'm assuming you can use these instead of an amp? 

Converters

* [FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter](http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Digital-Analog-Audio-Converter/dp/B0053VKP8S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)- Converts digital to analog.
* USB version [FiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier](http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-E7-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B003E6K1VK/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)
* This is a [USB audio interface/ external sound card](http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-UCA202-Audio-Interface/dp/B000KW2YEI/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322389233&amp;sr=8-9). It has SPDIF  ouput

Types of Cables

* This is an [analog RCA cable](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-PureAV-RCA-Audio-Cable/dp/B00022TN86/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322386620&amp;sr=1-1).
* This is a [digital audio cable/ SPDIF cable\(?\)](http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink/dp/B001TH7GSW/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322386501&amp;sr=1-1)
* this is a [Coaxial](http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-PureAV-AV20100-06-Digital-Coaxial/dp/B0001XGQV8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322387777&amp;sr=8-2) which is also digital. 

Things that need explanation. 

* When do you need a DAC (digital analog converter)? USB or regular? 
* When buying an amp
* I also mention nothing about subwoofers. 
* Build a PC has a chart that shows how to get the most bang for your buck. This would be extremely useful but a huge undertaking.  ",,t5_2qmiy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/mqrwt/this_place_is_pretty_scary_and_overwhelming_its/

For those who may not know

1) Dynamic: A magnet is attached to a cone

2) Orthodynamic: A thin metal plate is suspended between two perforated grids of magnets. An electric current is then passed through the plate

3) Electrostatic. Fuck yes (spoiler!). A thin membrane, causing the ultrathin membrane to vibrate. Headphones here range from the Koss ESP-950 to the Stax 009 all the way to the motherfucking, cuntlicking, dicksucking Sennheiser Orpheus. Fuck that bastard.

I purchased a Koss ESP950; however

Transparency and affordability. Transparency, if I close my eyes, I'm there. Not listening to a headphone; not listening to Robert Plant's amplifier; no, I'm listening to Robert Plant. Transpaency means I can hear his goddamn vocal cords vibrating and Jimmy Paige's fingers sliding along his fretboard. Though I love my RF3's, my ESP950's simply embarass them for solo listening.

I went to my first Head-Fi meet expecting to love the HE-400, I couldn't shake the sheer, awe-inducing sense of realism that I heard through the Blue Hawaii / SR-009 setup.

I believe -- though measurements could prove me wrong -- that electrostatic diaphragms behave as close as is currently possible to the goddamn signal

Koss produced, but today, you might find them new for $600. This includes the necessary electrostatic amplifier. They have the speed I heard in the SR-007. With simple equalization, they easily surpass the lows of the HE-6. Do they equal the sheer majesty of a pair of Orpheus, driven by a Blue Hawaii? No. But, again, they cost $600-700. And I assure you, you'll get much closer to the music than the the HD-800's driven by a Bryston amplifier fed by a $1K DAC that I heard.

Also, since I'm poor as fuck since I put the fucking ESP-950's on my credit card. But I swear to whatever god you believe in that the MOTHERFUCKING $20K SENNHEISER ORPHEUS only sounds about 20% better than a $0.7K Koss ESP-950.

This is my verdict. I'll take these over a $2K LCD3 and whatever fucking amplifier it takes to drive that heavy

I feel Robert Plant. I experience Explosions in the Sky. I try to convince my roommates to listen to my huge

I desperately hope that I do not come off as promoting a single product, do so.

Been a longtime lurker and friends have been little help on this front

I recently upgraded my headphone setup to what I consider entry-level audiophile status. Here's the rig:

- Software: Audirvana+
- Source Files: FLAC (all minimum 16 bit/44.1 Khz)
- DAC: Schiit Modi
- Amp: Schiit Magni
- Headphones: HiFiMan HE-400s (velour pads)

Here are my planned upgrades:

- IFI iUSB Power Supply (http://www.ifi-audio.com/en/iUSB.html)
- Audioquest Cinnamon USB cables (http://www.audioquest.com/usb-digital-audio/cinnamon)
- Cablepro HiFiMAN Upgrade Cables (http://www.thecablepro.com/cablepro-earcandy-hifiman-he300-upgrade-replacement-cable.html)

I have a highly curated 30

This shift in my listening approach

This has now led me on the hunt for albums that can be enjoyed to from start-to-end. Albums that have high production value

I'm open to almost all genres (not into country/hardcore/pop)

- alt-J - An Awesome Wave
- Bon Iver - For Emma
- Sebastian Tellier - Sexuality
- El-P - Cancer 4 Cure
- Twin Shadow - Confess
- Fiona Apple - The Idler Wheel
- Weezer - Blue Album
- Hidden Orchestra - Night Walks
- Neutral Milk Hotel - In The Aeroplane Over The Sea
- Interpol - Turn on the Bright Lights
- Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon
- Miles Davis - Kind of Blue
- Blue Sky Black Death - NOIR
- Amon Tobin - Isam
- Girls - Father
- Cloud Nothings - Attack on Memory
- Wild Beasts - Smother
- Calexico - Algiers
- C2C - Tetra
- Grizzly Bear - Veckatimest
- Beach House - Teen Dream
- Foxygen - We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace &amp; Magic
- Metronomy - The English Riviera

Does anyone have any favorite, did any of your older albums jump back out to you? Did any new ones stick out and really make you say 'wow'?

Here are two reference links that are helping:

Note that the first few seconds of audio appear quiet, meaning that what it outputs is anything but bit perfect.  In short, it's not capable of playing back a file without stuttering.

Now, to not be noticeable, except perhaps the odd pop and click, depending on when it happens), what about a null test where it plays back correctly.

Well, I finally found a long enough segment from a track that seemingly nulled in Audirvana.  The remaining noise in the null was at -70.3 dBFS, which, you know, is audible as _noise_ in silent passages of a track, even at relatively moderate volume.

When you add the fact that Audirvana is probably the worst behaving piece of software I've had on this machine

I won't be recommending Audirvana to anyone

I'm cross posting this to /r/diyaudio as well

**Background:**

The 'Frugel Horn' is an open source, I ordered a kit from [Planet-10 Hifi](http://www.planet10-hifi.com) and put it together in my apartment with some simple clamps and wood glue. Building it from scratch would have made these MUCH cheaper- it was simply not an option for me. I'm in to these about $700 total at this point- but they could be built for less than half of that.

**Driver Selection:**

As mentioned, but provides the benefit of parameter matched drivers, pre-broken in, and put through the ""EnABLed"" process- which is more or less 'painting' a series of dots/lines on the cone that is supposed to improve the dispersion of sound. Does it work? Who the hell knows! I couldn't A/B them against non-EnABLed drivers so I have nothing to report there.  I purchased them from Planet-10 because of their break-in/matching process- not for the EnABLe process. It does make them look cool though :p Here are some photos:

http://i.imgur.com/RWY6s.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/Oa77z.jpg

And the spec sheet:

http://i.imgur.com/QOBkU.jpg

**The Build:**

So here we go. The build was fairly uneventful- basically consisting of applying glue

The materials:
http://i.imgur.com/X01jo.jpg

And assembling..
http://i.imgur.com/jUhUJ.jpg

Don't forget to bring some clamps:
http://i.imgur.com/T0EFq.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/FMxkB.jpg

Awful soldering job ahead:
http://i.imgur.com/JcgOu.jpg


Ok- now it got a bit more interesting. Once assembled, listening, then adding/removing fill material until the bass sounded nice, smooth, and flat. Without any fill, they are quite boxy sounding- the fill makes a WORLD of difference. Of course, the fill was provided by Planet-10 as part of the kit- thanks Dave!

Filling:
http://i.imgur.com/VMVF4.jpg

Testing in a blurry room:
http://i.imgur.com/f8kmy.jpg

**Finished?:**

Ok guys

1) I can't decide how to finish them. Paint vs stain vs veneer+stain. 
2) I'll have to take the drivers out and not be able to listen to them during the process!! 

Either way- when people come over- they've complimented how nice our speakers look ?? I mean, I'll follow up with more photos once I actually 'finish' them..


**Review:**

My set up is a Marantz nr-1402 (a lower end Marantz receiver) providing a max 50watts. This is fed by a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon turntable with the Ortofon 2M Red cartridge- then through a Pro-Ject Phono S pre-amp. For digital

My initial reaction, I knew that these would get low, but it's still difficult to prepare yourself for that sound coming out of such small, innocent speakers. 

Now, extremely musical- never overwhelming- but still has presence. The mid-low-bass region is where I have found so many speakers to have extremely peaky response. We've all heard it- where a 5 note bass line will go from one note being nearly inaudible to another note that is so loud it overwhelms everything. These have no such issues in my listening room- extremely flat response. 

Enough praising, angled into corners which acts as a natural bass-boost. In my room, I can only do that with my left channel- I don't question that a better layout would help that low bass response. For the music I generally listen to, this isn't much of an issue- but could be for others.

Let's talk about where these guys *really* shine. Vocals! Wow wow wow, obviously, eliminates crossover points and allows a single source for the entire vocal range- I'd say this has a lot to do with how well these do vocals, especially female. They simply sing- extremely impressive.

And finally

Some other thoughts:

These are very directional and small adjustments to the placement of them make dramatic difference to their sound. There is really only one 'great' place to sit when listening (my seat of course :p ). I'll be adding outrigger feet in the future for greater control of the horizontal 'pitch' of the cabinet- elevating them slightly in the front seems to bring out the best soundstage. On that point- soundstage is remarkable for the size of the driver, but the feeling of 'wow- I'm at the concert' when closing my eyes isn't there as much as other, higher end, larger speakers I've auditioned. 

As far as loudness goes- it was something I was concerned about in my research- that they wouldn't get loud enough for my liking. I'm happy to report that these get PLENTY loud to fill a modest apartment with headroom to spare. Unless you have a HUGE space and demand ear-bleed inducing volumes

**Conclusion:**

In the end

The good:
-vocals

The not-as-good:
-bass 'kick' and extension simply isn't what you'd get from a larger driver
-Soundstage is very good

* Project Debut 3 deck
* Marantz CD873 CD Player
* Rotel RT-824 Tuner


The new addition to my setup is a Raspberry Pi! With a Griffin iMic.  Which will be upgraded when I get a proper DAC.


This is my first real Raspberry Pi project.  I decided I wanted an airplay box so installed Shairplay on my Pi.  That seems to work perfectly and has been for a few days.


I decided I wanted a little more though.  So last I night started thinking about Internet Radio.  I found a great guide here: http://contractorwolf.wordpress.com/raspberry-pi-radio/


I installed mpc and everything worked through the command line but I am running this Pi headless and didn't want to go into building hardware controls I just wanted to control it easily through my laptop or phone.


I created a quick and simple PHP application that let me submit a streaming link or select from a dropdown of saved links and play through the Pi.


I could have just used Shairplay to Airplay radio streams from my phone but... Well I just think this is cooler!

&gt;The quality of the recording is not dependent on the format of the file.

It is.  You can't accurately gauge the quality of a recording if the source is of poor quality


&gt;You can tell how good a recording is even at low bit rates.

Incorrect.  Listen to a 128kbps mp3 of Muddy Waters Folk Singer and the CD and you will notice the difference.  I think there is a need for people to listen to a proper copy of a song so they can judge whether they want to purchase it or not.

Initial thoughts are that the O2 is a very capable amp, my Ad2000 seem more alive in every way, though the bass seems to have picked up slightly while the highs seem more extended, matching the absolutely stunning mids. I have a few minor qualms with the JDS version of the O2, but only aesthetic. The music, in comparison to my iBasso D4, seems more alive with better separation. I'm ABing back and forth, and I am positive I will be buying this O2 from JDS instead of sending it back.

First, reviews, and other topics, and even the occasional troll (ha). I was even gone for 2 weeks and as far as I can tell nothing exploded.

Next, or [a recent Stereophile review](http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/aperion_audio_intimus_6t_loudspeaker/index.html)).

Of course I want to make sure everyone is comfortable with this, that it would be taking advantage of my position, and that they're effectively buying a review with the offer, none of which I'm entirely comfortable with.

On the plus side, and possibly the start of other reviews from other brands if the experience is good. I also like that the representative also wants to make sure the community is comfortable and the process appears to be fairly transparent. Of course, I would not be paid and would make every effort to be as unbiased and objective as possible.

He also mentioned that one or two others from the community could participate

I appreciate any and all opinions. Thanks again everyone.

**Update: It's unanimous!** Thanks everyone. I'll move forward with getting the equipment and keep you updated on progress throughout

Also I'll start a thread to compile a list of test tunes, Preamp, Amplifier that you'd like me to focus on, as I may have the ability to pick them up and ""upgrade"" my setup prior to the review.

I will also let them know that we have several people interested in reviewing the speakers as well
