1358405011.0,16qn7h,"Hello, FFA! I'm a bit new to this sub, but I noticed many of you are in ill-fitted bras.",JoanOfSarcasm,822,436, I identify bad bras pretty easily now that I'm in a properly sized one. 

I've been lurking this sub for about a month or less now -- someone dropped by a sub I frequent and said she was referred to us by someone here. And since I'm basically illerate in the language of fashion, I've noticed that many here aren't in bras that fit right. 

A fitting bra is more than just a number and a letter. It affects your breast health, [here is a great visual of how a badly fitting band as well as a proper one affects how your breasts sit](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CKU61X3PimM/TdwMi0xYIPI/AAAAAAAABcQ/QylXzgfBRyg/s640/bra_band_size_compare_30GG_28H_26HH.jpg).

I've also seen women who appear to be DD+ saying they're in C cups or smaller (with enormous band sizes!). Since there's always a bit of a misconception of ""cup size"" among those of us who have been in a wrong size for far too long (Victoria's Secret consistently sized me at a 34C -- I'm a 28FF!)

Anyways, but *please* [measure yourselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) over at /r/abrathatfits (even if you've been measured by a fitter at VS or the like) sometime if you have any of these symptoms of a bad bra:

* A bra that doesn't lift -- it simply sits ontop of your breasts and mooshes them
* A gore (central part of the bra) [that doesn't tack](http://cdn.breakoutbras.com/images/sizing1-frontwire-placement1-bad.jpg)
* A band that rides up
* Straps that curve away from your body in the back (band is too big)
* Strapless bras that slip down constantly
* Straps that fall down
* Gapping in the top of the cups (this can happen at any size
* ""Quadboobing"" or excess breast tissue that has nowhere to go in the cups
* Breast tenderness when you take off your bra that has nothing to do with your time of the month
* Neck pain
* Back pain
* Straps that dig into your shoulders
* Breasts that fall out of the center of the bra
* Breasts that fall out of the bottom of the bra
* Excess ""armpit fat"" ([this can actually be breast tissue](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/File:Migratedbreasttissue.jpg))

[Here are pictures of some of the symptoms](http://www.breakoutbras.com/sizing).

Here is my Before-After in my most-comfortable Victoria's Secret 34C and one of my new 28FFs:

* [Here is my before picture](http://i.imgur.com/6ixzO.jpg) -- 34C.
* [Here is an after picture](http://i.imgur.com/5fE7h.jpg) -- 28FF Freya Jolie. Not the same angle -- sorry about that.
* [And here is an album of my collection of 30F/28FF bras

I hope this helps someone. :)

**IF YOU WANT TO GET FITTED**

First, be fitted by the fitter and try on the bras they recommend. Also try on bras close to your size, especially in the [sister sizes](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png). A sister size is a bra that is smaller or larger in the band, but retains volume in the cup. Once you know the cup sizes (AA, A, D, DD, F, H, just apply this: go up one cup size

I mean really, twee is completely out of the question. That’s perfectly fine! It’s definitely not for everyone.   I wrote this guide to Modcloth

*I should mention this guide is more on ""How to do Modcloth right"" I've touched on twee because it is used in a lot of Modcloth fashion.

**Should I buy it on Modcloth?**    
The prices on Modcloth have a large range. There are plenty of affordable items—especially if you check out their sale section or wait for their clearance sales.  Sometimes they mark their items up a good $10-$15 more than other stores. Of course

Here are some stores that have similar stuff:    
* [Francesca’s](http://www.francescas.com/)       
* [Ruche]( http://shopruche.com/)     
* [Spotted Moth]( http://spottedmoth.com/)   
* [Asos]( http://us.asos.com)    
* [UrbanOG]( http://www.urbanog.com/) (mostly their shoes)

I could have made this list longer to include a few other stores

**Some reasons people love MC**    
1. The customer reviews + product descriptions:  They have a cult-like customer base. People are enthusiastic about the store.  They write a lot of reviews; they post a lot of pictures.  The product descriptions tell you what the items are made of
2.They have very good customer service: They have an instant chat service that you can talk to their representatives to get their advice or ask questions about how things fit. Within the US
3. It's really easy to sort through their clothes by size, styles, lengths. It’s like shopstyle, but built into the site.    
4. There's a huge plus sized selection of clothing that actually looks like the regular sized clothes. They also have dresses in longer lengths for you tall ladies.            

**Some reasons people don’t:**     
1. The price    
2. Clothing is too cutesy/twee; not to their aesthetic taste     
3. MC’s diversity of brands means not everything is going to be the same quality. Prices don’t seem to correlate to quality. Sometimes expensive items are cheaply made
4. A lot of the time, you could always order it and return it if you find it cheaper. Or chat with their reps. 

My opinion is that if you really like something

**If so many people like MC
1. It comes back to the quality of clothing.  Sometimes
2. MC is over the top with their cutesy promoting and presentation. It’s to the point of being sickeningly sweet and annoying      
3. People overdo it. Plain and simple: people wear too much stuff while trying to accessorize and be different.      
    
**What do you mean “overdo it?” am I overdoing it?**     

Modcloth loves to post style lookbooks. Upon first glance, could she BE wearing any more clothes?!*  Obviously, people in the real world don’t normally dress this way. MC is a business and businesses will try to sell their products. The more products their models are wearing: the more products gain visibility. You are not a Modcloth model. You did just not step out of a lookbook.

You can wear almost anything overly cute or bold

**“Modcloth done wrong” [ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O)**    
 In depth reasons and descriptions found in the album.    

**Comparisons before we move on**    
[Striped color cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/7i0TESX.jpg)     
On the left: The dress pattern and the cardigan have too much visual stimulation. The bow on top of that puts the outfit over the top. The shoes are also very heavy looking. I would generally recommend against wearing a shirt under a dress if you can
On the right: replace the dress with some simple dark jeans and she looks that much neater. The cardigan stands alone as the focal point of the outfit. The polka dotted tights/socks are unnecessary.

[Striped primary colors dress](http://i.imgur.com/zwf0pHh.jpg)    
On the left: The dress is a bold statement on its own. She pairs it with a neutral heel and her outfit is simple. It fits well and she looks effortlessly put together
On the right: She matches the headband, especially the yellow tights.    
The dress might look a little bit young by itself

**More examples of how to do MC right please!**

**Key notes:**          
-One or two non-neutral colors per outfit [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O#vytJsmz)     
-Unique items in neutral colors are easily paired into other outfits without looking costumey [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH#1vhLATQ)    
-If you choose a brightly colored or heavily patterned article
- Patterns can be mixed more successfully when they are in the same color family [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH#BhviOYD)     
-You don’t need to match everything with everything [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O#TTIHaBD)   

Thanks for reading! Questions and comments are appreciated. I'll be editing as we go along :)

**EDIT**

I am not judging anyone who wishes to dress twee to the fullest extent. The guide is for the number of you who do like elements of twee

I definitely AM a person who loves the overly cute things

If you want to wear knee highs, go ahead and do it. This is a guide! Not an instruction manual. You just do you. &lt;3

So you must be wondering


[Well, or just paint one myself :\ but this will just get my message across for now)

Well

*Red

Now

* Red + Yellow = Orange

* Blue + Yellow = Green

* Red + Blue = Violet

[Orange, Blue, and Yellow are the 3 *Primary Colors*.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vUprSPmTrLg/TyHLCAh0TSI/AAAAAAAAAAg/DQ5I3AJujsU/s1600/hdiusghacf.jpg)

With me so far?

So those are the secondary colors. Now

* Yellow + Green = Yellow-green

* Yellow + Orange = Yellow-orange

* Red + Orange = Red-orange

* Red + Violet = Red-violet

* Blue + Green = Blue-green

* Blue + Violet = Blue-violet

[This is a color wheel showing the different tertiary colors.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CqZ-pm1W7ec/TXBa3g9y3KI/AAAAAAAAARc/zLJ5SRTiVrk/s1600/tertiary%2Bcolors.jpg)


Now that you have some of the basics of the color wheel

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Color schemes**


There are different color schemes: 

* Analogous color scheme

* Complementary color Scheme

* Split-analogous color scheme

* Split-complementary color scheme

* Triadic color scheme

* Tetrads color scheme

* Neutral color scheme

* Accented neutral color scheme

* Warm and cool color schemes

* Monochromatic color scheme

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analogous color scheme**

One color scheme that is definitely something that is always used in fashion

Analogous color schemes are very popular in fashion as well. Here are some examples:

[This is a super easy example for you to show and see what I'm trying to explain to you all.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CZp9sWzeoZc/TgTsV3RWiYI/AAAAAAAAAOA/iefS-c9Q8g0/s1600/analog.jpg)

Notice how everything is using Blue

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Complementary color scheme**

Now, or Blue + Orange isn't a tertiary color combination? Well that's because all those combinations are *opposites* of each other and they are called **complementary colors.**

Have you noticed? Red + Green are Christmas colors, theoretically, if you mix 1:1 ratio of those colors together they make each color duller, making it gray. If you refer back to one of the color wheels, any color across from each other, called color opposites make a complementary color. Meaning these colors make a complement:

* Red + Green

* Yellow + Violet

* Blue + Orange

* Yellow-green + Red-Violet

* Yellow-orange + Blue-Violet

* Red-orange + Blue-Green

If you would like to dress really boldly

[Yellow + Purple](http://www.home-jewelry-business-success-tips.com/images/yellow-purple-complementary-color-scheme-polyvore-350x349.jpg)

[Or even the middle colors.](http://www.topbilling.com/website/admin/UserFiles/Image/Lifestyle/dairy%20of%20Fashionista/2011/october%202011/S-FINAL-1.jpg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Split-analogous color scheme**

Split analogous color scheme is a color scheme that includes a primary color and two colors one space away from it on each side of the color wheel. [An example is yellow

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Split-complementary color scheme**

Split-complementary color schemes are colors that follow a primary color and the secondary colors surrounding the primary colors' complement. For example

[here is an example](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=54796889)

Please excuse my crappy tastes. This is for example only... ;;&gt;_&gt;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Triadic color scheme**

As the implies, red, blue, and yellow make a triadic color scheme.

[Example](http://www3.dmps.k12.ia.us/north/nhsvisualarts/images/color/colorwhjtr.gif)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tetrads color scheme**

Tetrads or quadrads are any four colors with a logical relationship on the color wheel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Neutral color scheme**

Now a lot of people mention neutrals on FFA so here are the list of neutrals. Neutral colors are colors not found on the color wheel.

These are the netural colors

* Beige

* Brown

* Gray

* Black

* White

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Accented neutral color scheme**

Accented neutral color scheme includes 1 or more bright/bold colors in tiny bits or small *accents* with a neutral color.

For example

[This is another example](http://cdn.greenweddingshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/neon-shoes-DIY-01.jpg)

Another way to wear accented colors is black/white and red accessories or something of the sort. You get the idea.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Warm and cool color schemes**

During season changes

What does this mean

Warm colors include: 

* Red

* Red-Violet

* Yellow

* Orange.... etc.

Cool colors include:

* Blue

* Green... etc.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT MUST READ** 

I want you guys to know that orange can be a cool color too! If orange has more blue in it than orange then its more of a cool color. The colors I've listed are just basic guidelines. The same thing applies with purple. There can be a [warmer colored purple](http://www.finestpashmina.com/specials/Shawl-Warm-Purple/Shawl-Warm-Purple_2-tn.jpg) or a [cooler colored purple](http://www.thesaddlery.co.uk/images/cooler_purple.jpg) (although that horse saddle is almost blue-violet but you guys get my point).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Monochromatic color scheme**

Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a base hue (one color), if you dress like this, colors will be a little bit more subtle and boring, but if you add some diverse patters in it, it could totally change things up.

[Here it is on a color block](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg/201px-CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg.png)

[Here is an example of monochromatic color scheme.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_d5jVH0q1y80/SfFwsJ6PY1I/AAAAAAAAAb8/Zvo_dyQOUy8/s400/moodboard5.jpg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*sigh of relief* Okay that was a lot of information. I hope you guys can take this knowledge and apply it to the future and no more posts about what color goes with what okay? :)

There are very tricky colors however. For example
If there are any objections, please post down below and I will see to it if it is correct. And I will fix it. Thanks for your time guys!

Fit is the child of two elements: a garment’s construction + your specific measurements. For our purposes, too long, too short, too narrow, too wide, or in which the body parts of the garment do not line up with your own.


Fit is not objective. “Good fit” is dependent on specific styles and silhouettes; an “oversized fit” is not breaking the rules because it follows a different standard. Unfortunately, basic wardrobe.


##Why is fit problematic?


While the industrialization of clothing production has made clothing cheap and plentiful, and a slight hourglass/pear silhouette. The US size system today is based on non-representative samples collected in the 1940s when women were, on average, 1” shorter and 25lbs lighter than today. This, coupled with a lack of standardization and widespread vanity sizing, means that tagged sizes are relatively meaningless.


Signs of poor fit may include:


* clothing so tight it compresses the skin
* clothing so loose that it falls off
* clothing that is restrictive or uncomfortable in a normal range of motion
* fabric pulling apart at stress points
* fabric creasing and folding on itself while standing still
* seams that don't line up with body parts


***


##Garment construction


Most manufactured clothing is made of swaths of fabric designed to cover each body part. The individual pieces are then sewn together to construct the garment


There are several different types of seams used for different purposes including [flat-felled seams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felled_seam) for flat edges and lapped seams for heavy fabrics. Some seams


Seams usually correspond to body parts.


* The shoulder seam of a garment should (usually) line up at the edge of your shoulders and inner corner of your armpit
* The waist seam of a dress should (usually) line up with your natural waist
* The side seams should run vertically down your sides
* The center back seam should run vertically down the center of your back (may be used in conjunction with side-back seams to create structure at the waist or spinal curve)
* [Darts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(sewing)) and [princess seams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_seams) should align with the curves of the body.

##Assessing fit

The most practical way to illustrate fit is to walk through it


###BRAS + UNDERWEAR:


Obligatory plug for /r/abrathatfits, and does not show beneath your clothing. All other underwear should be tight to the body but nonrestrictive and comfortable. Spanx and other compression garments can be used to smooth out lines and bulges under clothes.


###TOPS


* **Shoulders**. In button-front shirts, so try to find a good fit the first time around.


    It also varies by style: *drop-shoulder* refers to shoulder seam placement that falls [somewhere along the upper arm](http://i.imgur.com/yESXRuX.jpg?1)


* **Armholes**. In garment construction, and upper arms.


    Most OTR clothing is designed to accommodate large upper arms and broad, so armholes tend to be too big or placed too low for many people. (Low armholes aren’t all bad — they make a garment easier to put on, especially if it’s being worn as an outer layer.) [In this image](http://i.imgur.com/Kxp0eWZ.jpg), the yellow shirt represents an armhole that is too deep for the arm, leaving excess fabric in the armpit. While it isn’t *that* noticeable when your arms are down, as soon as you raise them, the excess fabric then [untucks your shirt, and pushes up at the shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/BlXyYqz.jpg?1).

    Armholes are notoriously difficult to tailor: in order to slim them


* **Bust and Waist**. Most women’s dress shirts contain either two bust darts, they’ll cause the excess fabric to crease. (I had trouble finding a picture of this; [here’s an example](http://i.imgur.com/nPSutZ3.jpg?1) where the placement is fine, but the darts look a little long, causing the fabric to pucker and a slight faux-nipple crease to develop.)


    Darts can also be added to the [sides or back](http://i.imgur.com/JhCO6bZ.jpg?1) to prevent [waist billowing](http://i.imgur.com/Za4Cv46.jpg?1).


* **Sleeve Length**. There are many sleeve lengths; [this post from Already Pretty](http://www.alreadypretty.com/2012/10/how-sleeve-length-impacts-figure-flattery.html) gives an overview of different lengths and their overall effect. To clarify a few options, and full-length sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/j3zc7BN.jpg?1). Bracelet length is tricky because it can look like your sleeves are either too long for ¾ length or too short for full length.


    Generally, for example, though it can be a nice touch.


* **Hip**. Most untucked, or cropped) look best when the hem falls somewhere between your lower waist and mid-crotch. This is *highly* dependent on several factors, including height, waist length (long- or short-waisted), and body type (pears might not want shirts to cut off right at the hip). You’ll have to play around with several lengths to see what works for you.

To ascertain a basic understanding of your body type:

Measure your bust at the fullest part

Measure your hips at the fullest part (often the groin or upper thighs)

Measure your waist at the narrowest point

I will use a hypothetical woman with 38 inch hips to discuss how your results may affects your body shape. 

**Women who do not have a very defined waist, are rulers. This can also be called the banana.** An example might be a woman who has 38 inch hips, a 32 inch waist, and a 37 inch bust. Her hips are nearly the same size as her bust, but her waist is not very defined. If a ruler feels she has a belly she wants to hide, she may prefer to follow guidelines for an apple.

**If your waist measurement is bigger than your hips or your bust measurements, and 38 inch hips.


**If your hips are your widest measurement by more than two inches, and 38 inch hips. 

**If your bust is your largest measurement by more than two inches, and 38 inch hips.

**If your bust and your hips are roughly the same size (within two inches), and 38 inch hips.



***That advice is wrong and doesn't work for my body type***

Body type advice is very

1) Many women do not have a sense of what their bodies actually look like and are hung up on a particular part or measurement. Having a sense of your silhouette can make a big difference-- you may feel like you have a belly but if your waist is tiny relative to your hips

2)It can help you understand why garments fit you the way they do


3) Many women who are frustrated with their body would like to look more like an elongated hourglass. Understanding how your body overlaps or differs from this type can help you improve the way you dress. However


**Ok cool

1) Search FFA and Google for recommendations for your body type. You will find a wealth of knowledge and past posts for [pears](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=pears&amp;restrict_sr=on), [hourglasses](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=hourglasses&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [rulers](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=rulers&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Actually, re-looking at this, we haven't talked as much about rulers on FFA.

2) When reading this advice

3) When looking for clothes, but in general, there are very, very few brands that set out to cater to, say, the apple shaped woman. In general, you are going to have to buy clothing to fit the largest part of your body, or buy things where a looser fit does not matter. However

4) If you are unsatisfied with this analysis and would like to go a bit deeper into dressing your body


**More Advanced**

The first thing I would like to reinforce is that the idea of body type is very limited and just a jumping off point for understanding your silhouette. This idea has multiple components:

1) The most important thing is what aspects of your body you would personally like to play up and play down. Please read /u/Schiaparelli's excellent [guide in the side bar](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/) for a really incredible take on proportion. Most body type advice is about looking skinnier or looking more like an hourglass. This might not be what you want. It's good to have a mental list in your head about what components you would like to play up or down. I have wide shoulders and like them to look bigger

That said, wide ribcage, and love handles, while making my calves look more proportionate. What style of dress will do that?""

2) There are many other body type systems and guides, you can google around for a system that works best for you-- the one above is just the most common and straight forward as a starting point.

3) A lot of us don't find our body shape that important or helpful when dressing. You can read more about that in [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ajwta/how_useful_do_you_find_body_type_when_developing/). On the other hand

4) Other measurements and proportions that may be helpful  in understanding your body (this is just a preliminary look):

-Height: if you are very tall, you will look a lot curvier than someone ten inches taller than you given the same measurements. (Sir Mixalot demonstrates an excellent understanding of this concept when stating his preference for curvier women: ""36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".)

-Leg length to torso length

-[short waisted](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1a4rh0/what_worksdoesnt_work_for_a_short_waist/) versus long waisted: this intersects with torso length but is a bit different. 

-Hip shelf versus slope: do your hips start right under your waist or do you have a sloping curve out to your hips?

-Shoulder width: if you are a pear with broad shoulders

-Underbust: how narrow is your torso

-butt versus hips: does your hip measurement come more from butt volume or from hip width? If you have a round/athletic butt

-weight: skinnier women may appear to be rulers whereas heavier women may appear to be apples. Skinny women may also assume they are rulers because they don't see themselves as ""curvy"" whereas heavier women may think midsection weight makes them an apple. 

-Generally, front view body type rather than a 360 degree one. Either approach is ultimately limited. If you have a straight up and down torso with a large bust and a round butt, you may not feel like an hourglass or look like one in the mirror (torso does not slope out or in for waist) but you will measure like one. If you have a broad ribcage and hips with a defined waist (common among large framed people who are at their lowest weight) but a flat chest and butt, you could have a very sloped, curvy torso from the front but measure like a ruler. 

The better you understand some of these alternate variables

Measurements can be a source of anxiety but they are also a source of power. In our body image conscious society, and one feels she has the perfect body she wants to flaunt whereas another feels like everything is wrong. One's own feelings about one's body are a really important factor when getting dressed, but understanding your measurements and how they shape garment fit can be a helpful reality check. 

I hope people find this a useful starting point in thinking about body shape. I think it can be one useful analytic tool in thinking about how to dress oneself but should never be seen as more than a tool in your arsenal. You may choose to reject it entirely

And FFA, you do you, okay? Don’t worry about dem haters. Wear the SHIT out of your 2004 Aeropostale cute little monkeys graphic tee.” Which is a wonderful outlook to have, but ultimately a very destructive one in an advice sub.

After that grievances thread yesterday, long look at the comments. There’s a huge tendency on this sub to emphasize the positive beyond all else, to say “Hey, you look great! But change your entire outfit!”. When the OP does get criticized, there’s a tendency to backlash and say that the critic is unfounded and that that Fashion is Subjective.

While it’s true that women’s fashion has much more variety and is far less formulaic than menswear, or not at all. Why can we look back at an outfit from 300 years ago and still find it beautiful, even if you’d be ridiculed for wearing it today? Because of color and design and the way those elements relate to each other.

There is no higher fashion authority coming from above to hold you down and prevent you from expressing your special snowflake style. This is a crowdsourced forum of people telling you what they think is or is not stylish.

I get that women tend to have a more adverse relationship to clothes than men. In MFA, you have women for whom style has likely meant a lot of different things. We come with body issues and relationship issues and a whole slew of baggage from middle school when we thought we could never, ever be cool. We come from “I’m too fat to dress like her!” to “I could never fill that out!” to “My mom always pushed girly stuff on me and I’m a huge tomboy!” 

At FFA, we’re not that creepy dude on the street. We’re here to tell you whether or not your outfit looks good. PERIOD.

Some of those people will tell you that your outfit is ugly. Are you ready for that eventuality? Can you hear that you need to change what you’re doing and go home at the end of the day and still feel okay about yourself? If not

I think the number one thing that can be done to make FFA a better community is to change the way we do business. Fuck “Oh

There's a LOT more I could say about this but I need to go make grilled cheese and go to work :[

1357076820.0,15sej6,[Guide] Understanding fit and proportion in an outfit—conceptual guidelines for developing a discerning eye.,Schiaparelli,306,45,62,"**Note that this guide is in 3 parts

***

## Part 1

### Introduction

I've seen quite a few posters asking about how to judge fit and proportion. We (currently) have few resources on this sub for teaching someone how to do this

A solid understanding of fit and proportion is usually the first step to dressing well

* Being able to evaluate fit allows you to buy pieces that are properly shaped for your body. 
* Being able to evaluate proportions lets you go beyond body type and understand the reasons behind dressing for your shape.
* Developing an eye for fit and proportion lets you break traditional sartorial rules in a way that's still harmonious and aesthetically interesting.
* Being able to articulate what is off in fit and proportion also makes evaluating your own outfits much easier

This guide contains some practical tips (find your perfect skirt length! find out when you should belt!) but by and large it's a *theoretical* guide on developing an aesthetic understanding of fit and proportion. 

So

### General philosophies

* **Watch how clothing and accessories create horizontal lines that segment your body into regions**. One of the *greatest challenges* once you get the hang of things that aren't too loose or too tight is observing and understanding how horizontal lines section your body in an unflattering or flattering way.
    * *Changes in item*: the transition from a a shirt to a skirt (say by the hemline of the shirt hanging over the skirt or the shirt being tucked under the waistband of the skirt). The most common kind of segmentation.
    * *Changes in fabric*: [colourblocking](http://media-cache0.pinterest.com/upload/144959681727748249_AvEauNNH_c.jpg) ([via](http://www.vogue.com/collections/pre-fall-2013/thakoon/review/)) (this is a liberal example, both black](http://media-cache-ec5.pinterest.com/upload/74450200061397227_ciaemsGa_b.jpg) ([via](http://pinterest.com/gouree/style/)). Depending on the colours used, colourblocking can be abrupt or subtle as a horizontal division. Textureblocking tends to be rather subtle.
    * *Changes in proportion*: going from boxy and large in shape to slim and fitted—see [this oversized blazer worn with tight](http://www.styleclicker.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Oversized-Blazer-1.jpg) ([via](http://www.styleclicker.net/2011/03/27/oversized-blazer-munich-corneliusstrase/)), changes in proportion should follow how the shape of your body changes (swells or tucks in as you go from head to toe).
* **Consider the visual weight (how complex or dominant or heavy) of each item you're wearing**. Also
    * *Visually complex*: a [textured and embellished jacket](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/caroline-de-maigret-wearing-isabel-marant.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/03/06/the-philes-pfw/)), has a lot of visual detail. It has visual weight because people will naturally be drawn to complex patterns to break them down and synthesize them and understand them. [This outfit contains multiple visually complex elements](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wearing-isabel-marant-didier-pants.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/02/21/the-philes-12/))—the pattern of the jacket and pants, the shearling texture, the placket of her shirt peeking through, the lacing on her shoes. The muted, harmonious colour palette prevents these elements from clashing.
    * *Visually dominant*: a solid red peacoat has a lot of visual dominance—here, or focal points of varying importance or position, so a viewer's attention cascades from one attention-grabbing item to more subtle pieces. Note how [this woman's use of bright blue accessories](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wearing-isabel-marant-london-fashion-week-2012.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/02/24/the-philes-lfw/)) creates a visual path from head to toe, and her clothing is more muted to allow the accessories to shine through. The main argument behind two *very* brightly (and differently) coloured items is that, if they don't appear to relate chromatically—by complementing each other well—having two distinct focal points forces a viewer to split or juggle the object of their attention.
    * *Visually heavy*: mostly refers to volume—a [very thick knitted sweater](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/wearing-isabel-marant-12032012-3.png) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/12/03/today-im-wearing-isabel-marant-14/)); or the heel of a wedge
* **Notice how tightness/fittedness and looseness/volume affects your shape.**
    * *Tightness/fittedness can create the impression of slenderness or width.* Tightness in areas with little structure (say an overly tight sleeve around your upper arm) makes your flesh looked stuffed in and too wide for the containing garment. Tightness in areas with structure (say tightness around your hipbones) can emphasize shape.
    * *Looseness/volume can create the impression of largeness or smallness*. Looseness to the point of bagginess allows a garment to encompass more volume than your body actually occupies, it emphasizes the smallness of shape in the tightly-fitted areas. Note how [the voluminous skirt makes her waist and legs look smaller](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJTux0yplZ0/UKQuwwbhO8I/AAAAAAAABbI/7uZZMVHiSxQ/s1600/hourglass+dress.jpg) ([via](http://thefashionistacoach.blogspot.com/2012/11/q-fashionable-thursday-hourglass-shape.html)).
* **See when visual conflict is a helpful or unhelpful device.** I should note, because it subverts what our eye expects. Visual conflict can be used as a deliberate aesthetic decision—contrasting androgynous angularity with a feminine cut in another item, say. [Here it's used in combining bulky streetwear sneakers with a simpler summer look](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wearing-isabel-marant-coachella-part-2.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/04/25/the-isabel-marant-philes-coachella-2/)), but as the dress retains a kind of stripped-down sportswear aesthetic, the outfit doesn't feel *too* dissonant. Often, however, thoughtlessly introduced visual conflict will feel *wrong* in an outfit.

### The ideal body

* **Most fit and proportion advice assumes a certain body as the ""ideal"" body**. It's a slim hourglass with long legs. Know this
    * *Slim*: not sure I need to explain this to anyone who's been paying attention to mainstream art and media of the past decade or more. Deconstructing what makes this the ideal body type is beyond this guide. In general: most advice strives to make you look thinner
    * *Hourglass*: because symmetry, or the reverse intended to ""even out"" the perceived volume between bust and hips.
    * *Long legs*: this is interesting. Not only do models have a torso:leg ratio where the legs are a bit longer, and skirts (that aren't full-length). Going towards this leggy (and lower-leggy) ideal tends to look more pleasing to eyes conditioned by this model look.
* **Don't discard traditional advice on dressing for your body without understanding *why* you're breaking the rules.** Advice towards this ideal body type will still hone your understanding of fit and proportion,False,self,t5_2s8o5,1357103812.0,guide,,t3_15sej6

The French wardrobe philosophy to building and curating your wardrobe revolves around having a core of solid basics and expanding your wardrobe by buying **five pieces a season, actually). I and /u/supreme_mugwump mentioned it in the [comments to a post about trend fashion](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14cjk3/is_it_just_me_or_does_everyone_on_ffa_hate/), and a few people expressed interest in following this philosophy and having a discussion thread about it.

What's there to talk about? Well—

* where we want our wardrobe to be in six months
* making a strategy for how to buy pieces that will lead us to this goal
* figuring out what items are worth investing in as one of our five allotted pieces
* deciding which trends to buy in on and which ones to sit out on
* finding items that complement the rest of your wardrobe

## The rules

What's a ""piece""? Paraphrased from [here](http://www.paulamontessketchbook.com/2011/11/going-minimalist-5-piece-french-wardrobe/) *(the wording varies from source to source

&gt; 1. Fabric and quality is more important than quantity.
&gt; 2. Staple pieces (e.g. a white tee)
&gt; 3. Accessories don’t count
&gt; 4. Shoes count.
&gt; 5. Everything else counts.

Fashion typically has two seasons: fall/winter and spring/summer

The tricky bit about this is defining what's a ""staple"" and what's not. I'm hoping we can discuss this and figure out among us what are good definitions for these things. ;) 

***

## Why should you follow this?

I first came across the French wardrobe philosophy through [this post on The Fashion Spot](http://forums.thefashionspot.com/showpost.php?p=7137453&amp;postcount=63), with an eye towards longevity in quality and aesthetic. 

I came across it when I was transitioning out of my ironic Threadless shirt phase and floating in a mire of stylistic confusion. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to dress like beyond ""looking good"". I followed Lookbook heavily, at least anecdotally, that **the French Wardrobe philosophy isn't just for people who have a set style. It's useful if you're still evolving.**

**The heart of the French wardrobe philosophy, it's easy to let the dissatisfaction with where you are now push to do expand your wardrobe in a haphazard way instead of *growing* it into a cultivated aesthetic.

Reinventing your everyday wear—and, and it can feel glacial when you're looking at hundreds of street style shots online and your taste is now *fantastic* but you still look sloppy every day because your wardrobe and budget haven't caught up yet.

**So many people (myself included) try to move a wardrobe along a better path by buying pieces as individual statements of ""this is how I want to dress"", especially if you want to dress well on a budget. There's a certain frugality to buying your perfect or near-perfect item *once*, and have it fit perfectly into what you already own, and not having to replace it for a good few years.

One /r/buyitforlife idea I've come across dictates **buying things with the mindset

***

## Final notes

* **Just because it's called the French Wardrobe philosophy doesn't mean you have to emulate the ""French girl style""**. At its core
* **You don't have to have a huge clothing budget to be able to spend money on quality pieces**. In fact

1368569747.0,1ecdsi,Business Casual for Interns and New Hires: Tips and Resources,aktuarie,269,30,60,"I've seen quite a few requests about clothing for internships and new jobs in recent weeks so I thought I’d write up my observations and add a few resources.

First off, this guide can be accommodated to almost any dress code. 

If anyone in other countries or with dressier or more casual codes can chime in with additional suggestions that would be awesome!

**Here’s the low-down:**

* **No one really pays much attention to what you’re wearing.** Forget about wearing a different outfit every single day. If you can make ~10 outfits (2 business weeks)
* **Keep department demographics in mind.** Is your area of the office young and trendy
* **It’s easier to dress down than up.** If you’re feeling pretty clueless about the dress code
* **Fit is more important than price.** And by fit, and blouses need to… blouse *(without cleavage)*.
* **LAYERS.** It is shocking how cold an air-conditioned office can be when you’re sitting and permanently damaging your vision staring at spreadsheets. Bring a spare sweater to stash away on your first day.
* **Shop your existing wardrobe first.** Start with that snazzy suit you interviewed in. Maybe you have a couple nice blouses, and you’ve fully evaluated the dress code environment.
* **Walking shoes.** You may think you’re ace at bar hopping in heels, please buy a comfortable pair of flats for walking to and from work. Get a tote (also useful for brown bagging that lunch) and keep your heels in there.

**Guideline wardrobe**

* 2-3 pairs of dress pants *(look for dressy fabrics that feel silky/smooth
* 2-3 skirts *(at least 1 of these should be a neutral colored pencil skirt)*
* 2-3 dresses *(wrap dresses and sheaths look good on most figures)*
* 5-7 blouses *(button-downs, etc)*
* 2-3 cardigans *(at least one in a neutral)*
* 1 blazer
* 1 pair heels *(closed-toe and 3 inches or less is a good idea)*
* 1 pair of dress flats
* 1 pair of walking shoes *(avoid: Crocs

If you’re awesome and can make everything mix and match

Minus the jeans

**Shopping Resources:**

Buying basic pieces like a suit, and sheath dress is worth investing a bit more than other pieces because of their versatility and the amount of wear they’ll get *(but if it’s not in your budget, it’s totally cool and it will be fine, see the next paragraph)*. I’m a big fan of [The Limited](http://www.thelimited.com/), but [Nordstrom](http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/womens-clothing-wear-to-work-shop), [LOFT](http://www.loft.com/loft/catalog/category.jsp?catid=catl000019&amp;supCat=catl00002), [Ann Taylor](http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/editorial/AT-Lookbook/ANN-Wear-To-Work/cata000059), [White House Black Market](http://www.whitehouseblackmarket.com/store/browse/shelf.jsp?cat=Workkit&amp;catId=cat6219285)

For blouses, and accessories, less investment is necessary, particularly if you want trendier colors and prints. Stores like [Forever 21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) and [H&amp;amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/department/LADIES) can be good, but pay very close attention to washing instructions, fit, and how sturdy the seams are. It may not usually be your cuppa tea, ripped seams

If you have a couple of weeks and want to get really good deals

Try to find machine wash items as much as possible. Tumble dry is also a bonus, you can wear almost everything multiple times before washing/dry cleaning if you're good about putting clothes on a hook or hanging up right after taking it off. Here are some good guidelines:

* Pants and skirts - 5-6 times
* Blazers can go even longer between dry cleaning - 12-15 wears
* Dresses - 2-3 times (more like 1-2 in the summer when it's boiling)
* Sweaters/Cardigans used as layering item - 5-6 times
* Blouses - 1-2 times *(unless you're a magical unicorn who doesn't perspire from your armpits)*",self,t5_2s8o5,1368638671.0,guide,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ecdsi/business_casual_for_interns_and_new_hires_tips/

The French wardrobe philosophy to building and curating your wardrobe revolves around having a core of solid basics and expanding your wardrobe by buying **no more than five pieces a season** (a season defined as fall/winter and spring/summer—two per year). The idea behind it is to help you grow your wardrobe and transform your style in a sensible, and shop in a strategic fashion**. It's a great philosophy to consider both if you're just starting to build a ""fashionable"" wardrobe or if you're well into developing your personal style.

## The French Wardrobe rules

Paraphrased from [here](http://www.paulamontessketchbook.com/2011/11/going-minimalist-5-piece-french-wardrobe/) *(the wording varies from source to source

&gt; 1. Fabric and quality is more important than quantity.
&gt; 2. Staple pieces (e.g. a white tee)
&gt; 3. Accessories don’t count
&gt; 4. Shoes count.
&gt; 5. Everything else counts.

Fashion typically has two seasons: fall/winter and spring/summer, is defining what's a ""staple"" and what's not. Staple items are usually quite personal depending on one's style and needs.

## Frequently expressed concerns

* **Just because it's called the French Wardrobe philosophy doesn't mean you have to emulate the ""French style""**. At its core
* **You don't have to have a huge clothing budget to be able to spend money on quality pieces**. In fact, and many commenters expressed French Wardrobe-esque ideas: buy less, buy slowly, do less with more. *(And, of course: thrifting and eBaying and obsessive sales stalking.)*
* **This isn't anti-trend

&gt; The most important part is that the process takes weeks or more for me
&gt;
&gt; 1. **Item Inspiration**. I've decided I want something. Perhaps it's from a blog or I just realized I had a hole. This item goes in my shopping list. My shopping list is with me at all times…*This list is specific!* For example I would write ""navy crewneck sweater"" rather than just sweater. Items have to be valid to my wardrobe before they even go on the list (fill a gap or be a replacement).
&gt; 2. **Wait and Consider**. Every time I am getting dressed and think ""I really wish I had…""
&gt; 3. **Evaluate the list**. Typically when I'm adding a new item
&gt; 4.  **Window Shop**…Being extremely harsh in the dressing room is IMPORTANT to me. It must fit, but I leave it there so that I can think about it. Sometimes the item is forgettable, and I move on. I also try on items outside of what I think my size should be, if I'm unsure of the brand's sizing (one size up or down)…
&gt; 5.	**Make the deal**. Weeks or months later…I've finally found the perfect version of the item. Perhaps I tried it on previously and can't get it out of my head. I am completely committed to this item now. I usually wear it the next day

&gt; The first step, if you're looking at inspiration pictures, you can identify a common element…Take that one item, and find the one that's perfect for you…Don't go for the first one, or even the second, and give yourself an ample budget by cutting back on other clothing purchases.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, you can create a kind of aesthetic if you were to buy basic pieces you love, and which fit the aesthetic, and just a couple of must-have pieces that tie it together.

/u/maneating_cats on [defining her style for a cohesive

&gt; What helped me define my style was to pick a person whose style I loved, but it's worked wonderfully. I now have a small, cohesive wardrobe of classics I love and wear constantly…It's also made shopping less stressful—I don't feel pressured to try and consider everything and anything that looks good…sounds boring but it's helped calm down my materialistic urges. And I'm at the point where I don't feel like I really need or want more clothes, so it's worked.

&gt; I think it is important to acknowledge the difference between something that you like
&gt; 
&gt; When I started, and I could appreciate the items that were beautiful but not for me…Seeing something on yourself is a really important step. Find stores that have a good return policy so that you can take things home and see how they look with what you already own. An amazing top that you have to buy pants and shoes for is maybe not such an amazing top.

A suit is a uniform. Through wearing a suit, this section is going to be more proscriptive than the other days, and than FFA generally is. 
A good suit should make you feel [badass and powerful]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7aDstrDMf0)  (though save the short skirt for after work). It should not make you feel like you are wearing your mom’s clothes.  

**Do I Need a Suit?**

If you are interviewing for office jobs on the East Coast, or hope to work in law or finance, you need a suit. If you are in academia, I would highly recommend a suit for conferences and interviews.  One rule of thumb is that if you would ever wear a suit on the job, you need a suit for the interview. I have many friends who work in nonprofits and philanthropy in my conservative mid Atlantic city. They can wear jeans and nice sweaters to work. However, they are expected to wear suits once or twice a year, for presentations to the board and to donors.  It would be highly recommended to wear a suit for their interviews.  It’s better to err on the side of too formal than too casual

If you have an interview that you don’t need a suit for

**Components of a Woman’s Suit**

A woman’s suit typically has two pieces. First, and the rules about number of buttons are less strict than in men’s fashion. 

Second, but these are currently hard to find.

A suit variant is a [sheath dress]( http://www.lordandtaylor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lord-and-taylor/sleeveless-sheath-dress-0225-m9rb7901--1) made of suiting fabric, big three consulting) interviews, it might be better to stick to a more traditional suit, but for most interviews, this is a valid option.

**Under the Suit**

Under your suit, a silk or modal button up shirt (I recommend Everlane or Equipment—pick up Equipment on Ebay to save $$) or a [shell]( https://www.google.com/search?q=suiting+shells&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4rTZUYHbFPOx4APzzIC4Cw&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667). A shell is typically sleeveless and closefitting. If you wear a shell to the office, you are committing to not take your suit jacket off as sleeveless clothing is usually inappropriate. In less formal offices, you may be able to wear colorful, patterned blouses under your suits (cue: men wear colorful ties or bright/pastel shirts), or even plain tee shirts (cue: men don’t always wear ties). 

For an interview

If you are busty, like when you raise your arms, you can sew a small snap or hook between the buttons over the bust. I find silk and modal button ups accommodate my bust better than cotton because there is more drape. 

**Fit**

For a traditional office, and most women will need to factor alterations into their suit cost. Petite and tall women should look for lines that have options for them to minimize fit issues. Good fit is really key to looking powerful and awesome in a suit instead of frumpy. 

Suit tops and bottoms should almost always be sold as separates. Don’t be alarmed if you are very different sizes on top and on bottom.  I’m usually around a two in suit bottoms and an eight in suit jackets and have a pretty typical hourglass shape. 

If you are very slim, I’ll update this.

If your hips are large relative to your waist or you have a bubble butt, and that’s ok. Just make sure the skirt isn’t pulling over your butt.

If you are busty, especially if you have narrow shoulders, looking for a suit that has a single button that buttons lower rather than one high button or a classic three button. [Hard for busty people]( http://www.yoox.com/us/women/shoponline?gclid=cjgztsignrgcfdkj4aodh2aasg&amp;tp=40539&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_us#/textsearch=armani+collezioni&amp;dept=women&amp;gender=D&amp;page=1)  [or] (http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/calvin-klein-jacket-stretch-one-button?ID=371065 ) [better for busty people]( http://compare.ebay.com/like/370837373655?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar) [or]( http://compare.ebay.com/like/130937455232?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar) The lower fastening placement can also elongate the torso because it creates an extended V shape. 

A skirt or dress for an interview should generally hit around your knees. If you are very tall, but avoid going shorter than that. 

**Dated Rules/Things You Can Choose Whether to Pay Attention To**

You may have heard a skirt suit is preferable for interviews. When our mothers were entering the workforce, it might also be a good rule of thumb. For 99% of interviews, though, I don’t think a skirt suit or a pantsuit makes a difference. I like my legs, and feel more confident in a skirt suit, so tend to always interview in skirts just to be safe. However, if you are not comfortable in skirts or find pants fit you better

In men’s businesswear, go for it.  Once you get a job, you can wear brown or khaki (in the summer) suiting if you prefer. White may also be acceptable in the summer in many workplaces—I have fantasies about a winter white suit in the future but I may need to improve my hand eye coordination first to improve its life expectancy.  In the south, seersucker and colorful suits may also be appropriate. 

Pantyhose: Some people believe you should always wear pantyhose to an interview, or either match your shoes or your skirt. (Grey suit, black hose, black suits or grey suit, grey hose, black shoes are both fine.)

Interviewer is male or female. This should not affect your interview attire. Ever. Unless part of your job is looking sexy

**Where to Purchase a Suit/ But suits are so fucking expensive**

Purchasing a suit is can be an undertaking

I’ve had success with suits from Banana Republic

Talbots and Brooks Brothers may cater to a different age demographic

Big department stores are a great place to look for suits because they will have many different brands you can try on to see what cuts work for you

Suits are really expensive

1)	Go to a major mall and try on all the suits in all the department stores. Make notes on brand and size you like.

2)	Set up ebay alerts for all the suits you like.

3)	Purchase the components of your ideal suit from ebay for a steal.

4)	Try it on and get it altered.

Notes:

1)	If you like skirts and pants

2)	Take good care of your suits. A really good suit that is covered in lint and wrinkled looks likes crap whereas a cheap suit that is cleaned and ironed can look good.

3)	If you have a last minute interview and need a suit

**Interview Shoes

You should wear neutral colored shoes for an interview that coordinate with your suit. They should not be open toe or patent leather (no shine). If they’d look cute at a club

I prefer to wear a pair of black pumps. Standard interview recommended heel high is 3 inches and mine are 4—some people feel higher pumps are too sexy for an interview

It is FINE not to wear heels for an interview, don’t wear them for an interview. Wedges are too casual to pair with suits but may be ok for less formal interviews. Plain neutral flats work well with skirt suits. Oxfords or loafers can pair with pant suits.

Jewelry and makeup should be simple and non-distracting. I like pearl studs because they draw light to the face, just nothing too big or dangly. 

You don’t need to wear makeup for an interview if you never wear makeup. In any case

Your hair should be flattering and professional. A French braid is ok, I used to feel it was inappropriate to wear my hair curly for interviews, but  I think it’s fine to embrace your natural texture.

&gt;[I] am a little suspicious of 'the fashion world' in general when it comes to race, which in turn is a reflection of racism in society, and stereotypes of black men as gangbangers, thugs, etc. ... And I think that is more than a little problematic, if not outright racist in some cases, but it is probably an aspect of race which none of us can escape

There's a lot to unpack here, particularly in light of the fact that [we are disproportionately white and Asian](http://imgur.com/eO4eK9L,VOWgPdP#eO4eK9L) compared to other races and ethnicities.

Some starting points to consider:

* [the ""invisible knapsack""](http://ted.coe.wayne.edu/ele3600/mcintosh.html) of white privilege.  In fashion, even the original color of Band-Aids.

* whether certain races can ""pull off"" a look/item that other races can't

As far as street fashion is concerned, platform shoes, bright dyed hair, and pannier skirts. Many of these pieces are homemade and many are purchased from small designer shops throughout Japan. Much like male fashion in Japan, female fashion is characterized by heavy layering, interesting silhouettes, and a willingness to experiment with just about anything.

Using the word “boyish” to describe a woman subtly denies her femininity and even questions her gender identity. As a cis-girl, I’m never in physical danger because I don’t appear to be a “real woman”. 

However, small breasts, and slim hips. Even though you probably don't intend it, using the word “boyish” to describe their bodies is insulting and problematic. To a transgirl, “boyish”,  reflects a world where her femininity is doubted, shamed

1351787704.0,12gpwx,A Beginner's Guide to Business Casual,nothingsong,214,28,40,"Business casual is sometimes cited as the most common type of dress code in American workplaces.  It is vital to learn how to wear business casual when you are in college or looking for a job -- the more you can incorporate it into your everyday style

***When to Wear Business Casual?*** 

Most white-collar workplaces fall into this dress code, and orientations depending on your field.  It can also be acceptable in many informal interviews, such as for a retail job or volunteer position, but if you are in any doubt as to what you should wear, ask your host, supervisor, or interviewer ahead of time for the dress code – it’s always fine to ask.


***What to Wear?***

As a rule, and conservative, but with considerable room for interpretation from one workplace to another.  Look for pieces with modest cuts (no cleavage, no thighs, sometimes no shoulders), largely neutral colors/patterns, and a minimum of casual elements such as buckles and embellishments.  While parts of your outfit might be more formal and others more casual


**Tops**

* Most blouses and tailored shirts are fine in any color so long as the prints and materials are not overtly casual.  For example

* Plain shirts may have crewnecks or scoopnecks, or [sheer](http://i.imgur.com/NbI2Z.jpg).

* [Sweaters](http://i.imgur.com/ifr5B.jpg) and [cardigans](http://i.imgur.com/7Dv7X.jpg) are great but avoid sweaters with [informal prints](http://i.imgur.com/JYoyB.jpg) or trendy cuts on the [back](http://i.imgur.com/ZLlOd.jpg) and [sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/UbJU8.jpg).


**Jackets and Outerwear**

This probably varies based on your climate.  I live in Philadelphia which is pretty temperate, trenchcoats are fine, but I would generally avoid coats like [windbreakers](http://i.imgur.com/6LNeE.jpg), fleece (I’m looking at you, [North Face](http://i.imgur.com/mtqCS.jpg) sorority girls), [anoraks](http://i.imgur.com/tiSPh.jpg), [big puffy coats](http://i.imgur.com/bRCan.jpg) and [parkas](http://i.imgur.com/o3im5.jpg) because they tend to have extra embellishments, and often come in less neutral colors.  However


**Bottoms**

* Khakis and straight-leg trousers in black, white, navy, and grey are always a safe bet but watch out for the cut.  Stick with straight leg or boot cut if at all possible, since ~~flared,~~ skinny, and boyfriend cuts can range from too trendy to too casual.  **Edit**:  Commenters have pointed out that pants with a flare can be ideal on athletic body types.

* Leggings as pants are never okay

* [Capris](http://i.imgur.com/AzjMS.jpg) in the summer are usually OK but check around your workplace first.  It's not glamorous but if it's hot

* For skirts and dresses

* [Dark wash straight jeans](http://i.imgur.com/cYvRZ.jpg) are becoming more and more acceptable in BC


**Shoes**

* Pumps

* Ankle boots can be fine but this really depends on the material and embellishments – [this one](http://i.imgur.com/LYJ7Q.jpg) is probably okay, distressing, and lacing detail).

* While it may be possible to wear mid-calf or knee-high boots in a business setting

* As a rule, flip-flops, combat boots, ~~loafers~~, moccasins, and heels above 3” unless you are sure they’re OK.


**Accessories**

This one is hard to mess up.  Anything is pretty much fine in moderation as long as you keep the tone neutral.  I would avoid things like chunky knit scarves and legwarmers

* Wear makeup sparingly.

* Don’t wear too much jewelry – I find that one necklace

* As far as tattoos:  my visible tattoos have never been an issue, and you can test it out at Sephora.)


***Casual Fridays***

Also known as dress-down days, that means that dark wash, straight leg jeans are probably fine on Casual Friday.  No matter what, dress sensibly.  Don't wear anything that would make you feel uncomfortable talking to your boss.

***Some Outfits*** (feel free to link me to some more

* [Knee-length pencil skirt, and pumps](http://i.imgur.com/n9rWN.jpg)
* [The current Banana Republic lineup](http://i.imgur.com/jfFzi.jpg).  Note the cut of the shirts and length of skirts/dresses.
* [More Banana Republic](http://i.imgur.com/MlNNH.jpg)
* [This has been cited in the comments as a business casual outfit with knee-high boots](http://i.imgur.com/3ovb5.jpg)


***Where to Buy?***

You can find acceptable pieces almost anywhere, Ann Taylor or Ann Taylor LOFT, and J. Crew cater to this dress code almost exclusively.  Department stores like Macy’s, Nordstrom’s, and Kohl’s will all have business casual wear in addition to casual clothing.  Avoid places like Urban Outfitters and Forever 21.  Even if you could find acceptable pieces from those stores, the lack of quality would probably be noticeable.  It’s worth spending more for basic pieces that you will wear over and over, like a decent blazer and pumps.

1374313465.0,1ios54,I purged my wardrobe and learned a lot,Eau_de_Zazoom,216,28,39,"I'm a pretty new poster here and I am working on building a better wardrobe. I was inspired by a couple recent posts to finally purge my wardrobe and it was a really worthwhile exercise
I learned that:


 * Most importantly, I don't own an iron! Once I cleared a bunch of clothes out, the clothes I am keeping fit much better in the drawers and I could hang up more clothes on our rack. Still need to buy an iron though...


 * Many of the tops I was getting rid of were the same shape


 * For the most part I am happy with the colours of my clothes; most of the clothes I got rid of I was really happy with how they looked! My main issue was fit. I am about 5'10"" and about 125 lbs so many things are too short for me


 * I already know that high-waisted pants and shorts look better on me


 * Most of my clothes are pretty old! A lot of them are 5years+ meaning that I bought them back in high school/early university (I'm 24 now). I like to think I've changed since then but my clothes haven't. Over half of what I got rid of is not in good enough condition to give to a second hand shop due to pilling


 * Over the years, ratty tops, etc. Considering I was only keeping about 45 pieces of day clothing, having 1/3 of my clothes being for sleep seemed excessive! I mean I know we spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping but really, it was time to bite the bullet on some of those pieces. 


 * Many of the things I was keeping were things that I thought I could fix. This was stupid because I don't own a sewing machine and I'm terrible at sewing anyway. I wouldn't get these clothes tailored for the most part because they were so cheap to begin with it wouldn't be worth the expense.  


By cleaning out my wardrobe I learned more about what I have that's working and what isn't. I learned to pay more attention to caring for my clothes and replacing them when necessary. And it helped me to get my priorities in line- I need more evening clothes since I got rid of basically all of them. I also need more work and business appropriate clothes (I thought I had some good work trousers but it turns out I don't-good thing I found that out now and not the day before an interview!). These are all things I've read about as common issues,,False,self,t5_2s8o5,1374314063.0,,True
1373471236.0,1i0hqs,Business Casual,thethirdsilence,202,15,51,"Business casual can be the most frustrating of all work dress codes because it is an imprecise term that encompasses a large spectrum of formalities. The spectrum can include everything from suiting seperates, and people who want to wear a “uniform” to work can still create one.

In this guide, I’ll give four 20 piece business casual capsule example wardrobes. These are not intended to be prescriptive but may provide a jumping off point for the new and the bored to think about making a business casual wardrobe that works for them.

**Basic Guidelines**
Work clothes should always be clean and not ripped or distressed (worn looking denim has some good applications but is not office appropriate). Very tight clothing and cleavage aren’t appropriate, and two is a safer guideline. Sleeveless garments aren’t appropriate in most offices, although they are fine when paired with cardigans or jackets. If you wouldn’t wear it to meet your SO’s parents for the first time, it probably isn’t ok for work.

**Factors Affecting Outfit Formality**
Several factors make a garment appear more or less formal. These factors include: structure, regardless of what it is paired with. A riskier choice may be appropriate in a smaller number of offices, or it’s safety may depend what it is paired with. How risky or safe you choose to be is not just dependent on your office environment but also on how comfortable you are with clothing that may stand out. I really like my clothing to stand out in my non-work life, but in the work place, I want to make sure I get remembered by my work product and ideas first. (If I worked in fashion or any other creative industry I might feel like the two were more closely linked!) 

 In most business casual environments, you can stay within an office feel by wearing a chartreuse pencil skirt. If you want to wear a swingy, pleated midi skirt, you might be able to make it appropriate by purchasing it in navy and pairing it with a tucked in white OCBD. A printed, colorful, A line dress is hard to make office appropriate, even if it is modest, a print sheath dress or a black a-line dress may work in many business casual offices.

**An Attempt at History**
One confusing thing may be that men’s office fashion and formal event fashion are very similar

My understanding is that our concept of what women’s work clothing is derives from World War II. Women’s fashion during that time emphasizing appearing strong and non-frivolous, the fashions that were dominant during that time shaped our conception of what is appropriate for a working woman to wear. When boomer babies entered the work place, they drew inspiration from this era. 

**Types of Clothing That Could Be Part of a Business Casual Wardrobe**
Pants: Everything from traditional suiting pants, to chinos. The most office appropriate cuts are trouser, straight leg, or wide leg. Hem pants to go with either heels or flats, whatever you wear more often, but make sure the hem on a wide leg or trouser pant ends 0.5ish” from the floor, not above the ankle. 

Crop pants (like the estimated jcrew mini): most crop pants are very fitted so may be less office appropriate. If people wear jeans in your office or skinny-cut pants

Skirts: Should be around knee length,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.dmg&amp;fp=a5a58958e5a185bb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=potaJvQlxAvNgM%3A%3BaMpZVPeMB6HAsM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbodyconskirt.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2012%252F01%252FMiso-Body-Con-Skirt-at-Wome_std.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbodyconskirt.net%252F%3B465%3B460) [skirts]( http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=64133&amp;zmam=33862506&amp;zmas=1&amp;zmac=39&amp;zmap=48018982_RED_L&amp;gclid=CM-syaaPpLgCFc2j4AodKggAcA). A pencil skirt is tailored and has some structure by itself, a bodycon skirt is stretchy and your body gives it its shape. A line skirts are fine for the office, but may be harder to find in office appropriate styles and cuts. YMMV based on your office, but you are safer with a-lines that are neutral colored or have a graphic, as opposed to floral,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608, for example.

Dresses: Sheath dresses are a no-brainer, and a-line dresses can also work well.  Sweater dresses may also work in less formal offices. Just remember to bring something to cover bare arms and shoulders. If a dress has cut outs, or a sheer back, it isn’t appropriate for the office, and putting a blazer on won’t fix that.

Cardigans: an easy ‘third layer’ for office outfits

Blazers and jackets: easily make an outfit look more formal. Avoid jackets with visible hardwear. Avoid leather unless people are allowed to wear jeans. It’s bad to rely on any piece of clothing to save an outfit

Tops: you have the most flexibility here. Some button ups in cotton, a  drapey t-shirt under a suit can look amazing) but avoid graphic tees and very thick tees.

Shoes: Pumps, loafers, ankle boots and riding boots are all options. Some color through your shoe may be all right but avoid very trendy  and loud colors (neon or mint are very risky whereas oxblood could work). Avoid platforms and very high heels. Wedges are ok, but avoid espadrilles or anything that looks beachy. It can be hard to wear knee high boots with a skirt to the office without imparting an overly sexy look, but it can work if you pair the boots with tights in the same color rather than bare legs.

**Shopping for Business Casual**
You can find business casual clothing at most department stores, Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, J crew, J Crew factory, The Limited, Express, and Brooks Brothers. Boden can be helpful for work appropriate dresses and you may be able to pick up inexpensive blouses at Target. 

If you’d like to thrift for your business casual clothes and live in or near a city

If you are trying to figure out how to allocate a budget for business casual clothing, and it’s worth investing in tailoring. Tops and cardigans are the best place to save—look at the sale rack of Ann Taylor and BR during January and August sales and try on everything in a color you like in your size. 

**Interviewing**
Let’s say you have an interview with a company where everyone wears jeans. To make a good impression for the interview

Business casual bottom+ business casual top +third layer (blazer or cardigan). 

The third layer makes it look a bit more formal and pulled together. Avoid anything uber trendy unless it’s a fashion or creative related industry. The rule of thumb for clothing retail interviews is to wear clothing *like* the clothing sold in the store

**Four Sample Business Casual Wardrobes**

(I don't really understand Pinterest or Polyvore but if anyone has free time and wants to try to make style boards for these four cases I'm happy to help.)

*A doesn’t want to wear skirts or dresses or pieces with ruffles. She’s most comfortable in jeans and hoodies and thinks cardigans are fussy. She likes neutrals and earthtones.* 

1 interview pantsuit (pants and jacket) in grey/1 pair slacks in black/2 pairs chinos, green, etc. consider subtle pinstriping or bolder stripes for more visual detail/3 tee shirts in white and black  and maybe maroon/1 pair oxfords in black/1 pair ankle boots in cognac

These pieces are low-fuss items that could also be in a man’s business casual wardrobe and are fairly timeless.

*L loves color and likes the mid 60s office looks on Mad Man and wants to look appropriate for the office without feeling stiff.*

*H is a former college swimmer with narrow hips and a full bust line. She feels she doesn’t look good in pencil skirts and button ups usually don’t fit. She likes to shop at Anthropologie and Ruche.*

1 black blazer with a low v neck/black wide leg pants/grey wide leg pants—could also go with trouser-jeans in a more casual office/three patterned A-line skirts  (may already be Anthro buys in her wardrobe)/one brightly colored a-line skirt/one wrap dress/one a-line dress with a subtle pattern or texture/3 cardigans

H is able to avoid button ups by pairing sleeveless shirts with cardigans. She keeps color on her lower half  to balance out her torso.  She also can wear more whimsical prints to the office by pairing them with neutral pieces on her top half. 

*S really wants to get promoted but is the most junior person in her office by seven years. She wishes everyone would forget she wasn’t even alive when the Challenger exploded.  She’s working a lot of hours and doesn’t have a lot of time to think about her outfits. She wants a work clothes formula and doesn’t care about being creative or expressing herself*

Grey interview suit, grey, and a pinstripe/silk blouses in white and blue/black cardigan/v neck sweater/2 white shells/ black pumps (or nude if preferred)/ black flats

This list allows for the creation of more suiting-like looks (matching bottom and third layer) in a business casual office. The items should pair well together necessitating less coordination.

1342032451.0,wecf1,By Request: How and When to Belt,FFA_Moderator,209,25,59,"Ah

This is a guide on how and when to belt.

First things first: there are regular belts, which sit considerably higher on your waist.

**Regular belts**

Regular belts should be worn when you are wearing pants with a medium-to-low rise and your shirt is tucked in (half or full). ([Example](http://i.imgur.com/bNupb.jpg))

You should **not** wear a regular belt with pants that have a special type of closure:

* [Drawstring](http://i.imgur.com/2lZjn.jpg)

* [Ties](http://i.imgur.com/lLgKH.jpg)

* [Special buttons](http://i.imgur.com/rgxOv.jpg)

* [Foldover hems](http://i.imgur.com/nWBpO.jpg)

Also, you are destroying its silhouette and drape.

And please

**Waist belts**

Waist belts are a different animal

Waist belts should fall at the waist of your bottoms (whether they be [high waisted pants](http://i.imgur.com/EkaBQ.jpg)

There are also many different ways to tie waist belts to make them interesting:

* [1](http://i.imgur.com/O7vwF.jpg)

* [2](http://i.imgur.com/JY9bq.jpg)

* [3](http://i.imgur.com/bvA4O.jpg)

* [With the right length and rigidity

* [Some belts are extra long to allow for double wrapping](http://i.imgur.com/DAEHd.jpg)

DO’s

* Waist belts should typically be [thinner than a regular belt](http://i.imgur.com/aIBq7.png).

* [Waist belts should be used for contrastive purposes where a top and bottom (skirt or pants) meet](http://i.imgur.com/DuwaE.jpg)

* Waist belts should be used with [dresses that have a built-in waistline](http://i.imgur.com/W04aK.jpg)

DON’T’s

* DO NOT belt sleek dresses

* [Oversized waist belts](http://i.imgur.com/r3kb5.jpg) are almost never flattering

* Do NOT belt [empire waist/babydoll dresses](http://i.imgur.com/jjj3g.jpg). This is hugely unflattering for your boobs and your stomach

* [Belting over outerwear](http://i.imgur.com/RLxus.jpg) is incredibly risky and almost never looks good. [Bad](http://i.imgur.com/cX6Fy.jpg), us mortals don’t have a chance](http://i.imgur.com/9aXwn.jpg). It works better with [structured outerwear]( http://i.imgur.com/ZXvRf.jpg), and not so well with cardigans. Because of the softness and drape of cardigans, the belt doesn’t sit right and tugs at the silhouette.

* DO NOT wear waist belts with regular length shirts. [It looks very bad and unnecessary](http://i.imgur.com/YkItd.jpg). You do not need [a belt with your t-shirt](http://i.imgur.com/gqbtv.jpg).

*****

Obviously, belts ain’t nothin ta fuck wit.

When done well

Most outfits will look just as good

I entered a list of every item I own into a spreadsheet.  Then I noted if I wear it often or not and, i have a beautiful blouse I rarely rare because I can't be bothered to iron it *blush**


Then I pivoted to see how many items I wear often.  Shockingly


Next I pivoted on my proposed solutions.  What are my main culprits?  For me

My second biggest reason is simply not wearing an item that I like because it is 'too nice'  :p  I am 'saving' them for nicer occasions - which is pretty silly really!


Now I am going to work my way through my proposed solutions list to hopefully maximise my wardrobe.  I want to see more versatility in my clothes so that I don't have things sitting around doing nothing :)

This is highly recommended as a useful activity if you're like me and have a wardrobe full of clothes but nothing to wear!

Fun fact: two of us mods are men. And hell

Opinions and knowledge on style are built and grown independent of gender and orientation. Any person is capable of studying and learning the do's and don'ts of color, fits, and overall fashion trends.

And lets be honest

Putting particular wight to an opinion because of the source's gender or orientation is not really that different from weighting you grandparents' clothing advice more heavily because you want their approval. The appeal is understandable to a certain extent

The sad fact is that, mainly to be judged on the history of previous advice, is going to be far and away the best way to judge the merit of an opinion if you're not able to make that judgement entirely yourself. But it surely isn't gender or orientation.

TL;DR: Don't worry about (and in the same vein we don't care about) the gender or orientation of a source of advice

1. Get a stack of magazines from the bookstore and let her go through them to find the ones she likes in the comfort of her own home then get her a subscription if she wants one.
2. Get a few of the books that were recommended (I haven't decided which ones but one with drawing and one with just fashion/style)
3. Skip the sewing machine ""this"" year and see if she's interested next year
4. Look for some opportunities to go to a runway show. Love this idea!
5. Get her a personal shopper (after the holidays) at either or both JCrew and Nordstroms. Hmm...now that I think about it maybe she and a couple of her besties could have a sleep over then after breakfast I could take them over and they could do it together! 
6. Look for a class of some sort for us

*Fit Check Thread* - In an attempt to cut down on ""FFA, we've instituted  a weekly Fit Check thread to be posted every Thursday. This differs from WAYWT in that it's designed specifically for outfits you have questions about or directly want feedback on - note, however, that you may still receive constructive criticism in WAYWT threads.

*Need/Want/Love* - Buh-bye, what you want (can still serve the same function as Should I or Should I), and what you're loving - it can be something from Pinterest, Polyvore, the runway, or just a piece that you think is beautiful but would never wear.

1364424717.0,1b52xx,Short Guide to Wedding Attire,thisisnotxoxo,185,14,69,"**Dress Guide for Wedding Guests**


Weddings are happy, friends, fun, food and dancing. So exciting! So, you’re invited to a wedding. Now, the big question is: What do I wear? As a guest it is important to dress appropriately for the event. It is someone else’s ‘big day’ but you are invited to share it with them. There seems to be a lot of questions in /r/FFA about wedding attire. Here are some tips and ideas for dressing for a wedding.


**The OBVIOUS**: Do not wear anything white. Do not wear anything even close to white


**Hot tip #1**: Wear a dress. It’s festive and weddings are an occasion to get dressed up!


**Hot tip #2**: If you know what the bridesmaids are wearing then this is a good guide for the level of formality required for the event.  


**Hot tip #3**: Be mindful of the color theme of the wedding and try to *avoid* those shades. It’s a little awkward to be mistaken as part of the wedding party. The invitation sometimes has clues as to the color scheme.


**Hot tip #4**: If you don’t know the details about the wedding then err on the side of dressy. I find it’s better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.


**Hot tip #5**: If the ceremony includes a religious service in a church then consider a more conservative dress and something (a cardigan


**Hot tip #6**: Weddings are family events so save the sexy


**Hot tip #7**: As for any outfit


**Hot tip #8**: If you start early, bluefly.com, gilt.com and zappos.com. Many have free shipping and very good deals on high quality dresses.


**Hot tip #9**: The most important thing is to have fun and share in the celebration with the happy couple. 


**Spring/Summer Day Weddings**: These casual events take advantage of the nice weather but still require festive attire. There is probably something already in your closet that would be fine to wear. Depending on the venue anything from a cotton print sundress to a cocktail dress is completely appropriate. Cotton sundresses and espadrilles are great for destination weddings to a warm climate; think wedding on the beach. On the other end of the spectrum, glitter, metallic details because it can weird during the day time. Most colors with the exception of anything too light are okay but try to keep it bright for the season. Shoes should complement the style of the dress while keeping the venue in mind. Tiptoeing around in stiletto heels in grass is not fun.  

Here are a few ideas to serve as a starting point: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/spring_summer_daytime_weddings/set?id=76905570)


**Shopping tip**: Make sure to get a dress you know you can wear again for many other events. There are so many popular retailers that have a huge variety of these kinds of dresses: J.Crew


**Semi-formal Evening Weddings**: Evening events are generally more formal and require a cocktail dress.  I tend to stay away from busy floral patterns and cotton for evening parties because they can look too casual. Parties are usually held indoors, but keep in mind that pantyhose may be necessary for more conservative events. I always go with very sheer, nude or black hosiery. I tend to be sure that my hair is styled, rather than loose. An updo is not always necessary but it will help make the look more formal. Accessories will depend on the style of the dress. I generally accessorize more with plainer dresses and keep it very simple with ornate ones. 

Some inspiration: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/evening_wedding/set?id=76912520)


**Shopping tip**: Buy a timeless dress that you *really*genuinely like. There is more chance that you’ll wear it again instead of having to buy a new one for every event. Shop the sale racks and score a really great deal on a beautiful cocktail dress. A few stores to start looking are BCBG


**Black-tie Weddings**: Black tie weddings are so much fun. It is kind of like prom for grownups. This is an opportunity to really go all out. I tend toward floor length gowns in black and darker shades, I try to stick to season-appropriate materials; Reserve heavy velvets and taffeta for the colder months and lighter silks, chiffons for warmer. If you absolutely love a bright, patterned gown, then go for it during the spring/summer but make sure the material is quality and the accessories are kept to a minimum. My rule of thumb for tasteful gowns (and to avoid looking like you are on your way to a high school prom): Pick *two*: strapless, high slits, backless, slinky or embellished. The key word here is classy

A few dresses to consider: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/black_tie/set?id=76923643)


**Shopping tip**: This category is hard because the price points are pretty wide ranging. All of the same retailers I mentioned in the semi-formal category will have gowns as well. The trick is finding a nice gown without breaking the bank. Its completely doable by shopping the sale racks. It could easily be years before there is an occasion to wear it again so try to find something timeless and classic that will be wearable for years to come.


*Disclaimer*: This is by no means an exhaustive guide to wedding apparel. I just wrote this up because I noticed that there were at least two posts every day asking about what to wear to a wedding. The dresses are what *I* think are some good ideas, but i'm sure there are additional considerations. Consistent with all other /r/FFA advice, its important to dress yourself for your body type. I’m open to suggestions or input! Thanks for reading. Cheers!

If you're interested in participating, or anything else related to the challenge. Also please feel free to post any inspiration, such as blog posts about 30 day challenges (or similar) and other examples of completed daily outfit challenges. 

We've gotten some great suggestions and questions so far

* you could use this to help pare down your wardrobe!
* this could serve as motivation to get dressed or care about your presentation on off days!
* consider writing a sentence or two about the occasions for each outfit!
* PJs are totally great

I strongly suggest including at least 14 outfits in your final albums

---

I have a few logistical concerns that I'd like to get all of your opinions on in this thread. 

* How often would you like to see reminders? I would post something in recurring threads like GD not a standalone thread. 

* What are your feelings about latecomers to the challenge? I want to be as inclusive as possible

* Any other concerns/ideas

I wanted to come by and share with you [what I ended up getting her](http://i.imgur.com/xVsJM.jpg).

After talking with her it seems she's backed off ""fashion"" in recent months and is now more interested in drawing...specifically people. 

My selections reflected much of what I learned here (I didn't get the exact things people recommended but it was conceptually similar) as well as what my girlfriend felt were good compromises between fashion and art.

Magazines, a couple art kits, a henna tattoo kit (whoa...controversial) and a little Molskine note book for small drawings.

Also...$ for a shopping ""spree."" More like a baby spree but still she'll have fun.

Thank you everyone for all your wonderful help. I appreciated all your kindness and thoughtful responses. I wish I had enough money to get her all the things you recommended but please know that you really helped dumb old dad figure things out this year.

As you have all probably noticed

* ""Find me this _______ for cheaper"" 

* ""Help me find _______

* ""Where can I get something similar to _______?""

To be quite blunt

I think it would be pretty appropriate at this juncture to provide a quick guide on **How to Search for Things on the Internet.**

****

**Google**

Seriously

* Google **keywords.** For example, such as
    - black
    - dress
    - spaghetti strap
    - rosette
    - sheer
    
    Search terms can include shape, print, length, fabric type, brand (if known), and any other defining characteristics.

* Google **images.** Similar to the site [TinEye](http://www.tineye.com/)
    - Click on the camera in the search bar to input a URL
    - Drag an image from your computer directly into the search box

    If we image search the dress from above,"" the Net-a-Porter page on which it can be purchased, and a butt load of similar images and sites who mention it.

    You can also search using both an image *and* words by using the method above and then inputting words into the search bar.

Similarly

**Shopstyle**

I also want to include a quick note about another useful website

Search for any phrase (e.g. ""black dress, which then can be filtered by Category, Brand, Store, Sale, Price, Color

**Polyvore**

[Polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/?p=1) is similar in concept

**eBay**

We all know what [eBay is](http://www.ebay.com/). Just wanted to remind everyone that it can be helpful in finding garments that are sold out in your size or are out of production.

I'll be updating this as I go

[($) Forever 21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) has one of the better quality to price ratios of the fast fashion retailers. You get what you pay for, and sometimes odd sizing.

*[($) Love Culture](http://www.loveculture.com/) I believe this is similar to F21

*[($) Bon Prix](http://www.bonprix.co.uk/) UK based store. Reviews?

*[($) Matalan](http://www.matalan.co.uk/) Another UK based store. Reviews?

*[($) Papaya Clothing](http://www.papayaclothing.com/shop/) cheap clothes

[($) Charlotte Russe](http://www.charlotterusse.com/) : Basically the same as F21, even before being washed.

[($) WetSeal](http://wetseal.com/home.jsp) Same terrible-ish quality as Charlotte Russe. Great for cheap basics.

*[($) DebShops](http://www.debshops.com/) Any reviews? I've got nothing.

*[($) Supre](http://www.supre.com.au/Home.aspx?element=1&amp;category=1) AU-based

*[($) Stradivarius](http://www.stradivarius.com/) Never shopped here

[($$) American Eagle](http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp) Decent quality

[($$) Aerie](http://www.ae.com/aerie/) Offshoot of American Eagle

[($$) Aeropostale](http://www.aeropostale.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=3534619) Very little kid-ish

[($$) Abercrombie](http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreView?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10901) A little overpriced in my opinion but every now and then they'll come out with something really cute without a giant moose on it.

[($$) Hollister](http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreView?storeId=10251&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10201) See above. Replace moose with bird-thing.

[($$) Pacsun](http://www.pacsun.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-pacsun-Site/default/Default-Start) Very beachy. Some cute stuff if you look hard. If you go in-store they have decent jeans for 5-10 dollars

*[($$) CCS](http://shop.ccs.com/) Very streetwear. Kind of like Pacsun.

*[($$) Phix Clothing](http://www.phixclothing.com/) Retro stuff yay. Actually

*[($$) Love Clothing](http://www.loveclothing.com/) Basically Phix Clothing under a different name.

*[($$) Shop Akira](http://www.shopakira.com/) Similar to Phix Clothing/Shop Akira

*[($$) GoJane](http://www.gojane.com/) I think this is oriented towards teens but lately they've been getting some pretty cool stock. Any reviews?

[($$) H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/) Never bought anything online but the stuff in-store is mediocre quality

*[($$) Felicee](http://www.felicee.com/store/) Looks super-cheap to me.

*[($$) Fred Flare](http://www.fredflare.com/customer/home_fredflare.php?) Like a cheaper version of Free People. Cute gifts

*[($$) River Island](http://www.riverisland.com/) Some pretty cheap stuff

[($$) ASOS](http://us.asos.com/Shop-womens-clothes-dresses-shoes-coats-bags-more-at-ASOS/wh5yb/?r=1&amp;mk=VOID) I buy most of my stuff here- the sale section is like a candy store. Shipping is really good and they also have concession brands

*[($$) Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp) mostly overpriced, often a bit gaudy or over-the-top. Quality is so-so, perhaps a bit lower than the Gap. love this site. Good shipping rates and they have good streetwear brands. I love the shoes and outwear mainly. I got a Stussy jacket for $19 and another wool/leather sleeves jacket from 154$ down to $19. Both are exceptional quality. I also got some Jeffrey Campbell Tardy's for $50 a long time ago. They have really good sales if you keep checking back you will find some unbelievable steals.

[($$) Karmaloop](http://www.karmaloop.com/) Probably one of my favorite stores of all time! Streetwear clothing

[($$) Motel](http://motelrocks.com/shop/) Printed dresses. I'm not sure about the quality but the prints are gorgeous. Affordable alternatives if you can't afford Black Milk.

[($$) Tobi](http://www.tobi.com/) Probably another one of my favorite stores. You might find them cheaper elsewhere but use the 50% off first-timers discount to your advantage.

[($$) Romwe](http://www.romwe.com/) Hongkong-based store

[($$) Sheinside](http://www.sheinside.com/) Similar to Romwe

[($$) Solilor](http://www.solilor.com/) Also similar to Romwe

*[($$) Miss London](http://www.missguided.co.uk/dresses) ASOS in disguise

*[($$) Agaci](http://www.agacistore.com/) Mostly bodycon dresses but I really haven't checked it out that much

*[($$) Allyfashion](http://www.allyfashion.com/store/) is really good for the price. Most things are $20-$50 and are quite good quality for the price. I've had this dress from there for about four years, some of the stuff fits really weird on me personally. Supre- Infamous for dressing the less-than-classy-girls of Australia. I haven't walked into their store for 5 years and I'm not keen to do so any time soon. Everything is very thin, flimsy, cheap quality at normal prices.

*[($$) 2020Ave](http://shop.2020ave.com/clothing-dresses) Any reviews?

[($$) The Scarlet Room](http://www.thescarletroom.com/) The quality of pants/leather/denim is pretty terrible but I've bought some AMAZING pieces from this Hongkong-based store.

*[($$) Messes of Dresses](http://www.messesofdresses.com/) My preferred alternative to Modcloth. A little more expensive but some of the stock has that wow-factor that will get you compliments.

*[($$) Ruche](http://shopruche.com/index.php) See Messes of Dresses.

*[($$) Poetrie](http://www.poetrie.com/) See Ruche.

*[($$) Threadsence](http://www.threadsence.com/index.php) See Ruche. I've actually found that stores like GoJane sell the exact same clothing as Threadsence/Poetrie/Ruche

*[($$) Swell](http://www.swell.com/!Zc6KWo-tk4GWMD-g9-P6vg!/Womens) Very beach-y feel to it. A little more expensive than Pacsun but somewhat similar.

*[($$) NastyGal](http://www.nastygal.com/) Really large clothing company, Jeffrey Campbell etc. Kinda pricey but they also have good sales. I don't really buy off here but I have a few times. I don't like their shipping rates, and they also ship extremely slowly as compared to UO.

*[($$) Gypsy Warrior](http://gypsywarrior.com/) Similar to Nastygal

*[($$) Living Royal](http://www.livingroyal.com/) Also similar to Nastygal

*[($$) Asociete](http://asociete.com/index.php) Any reviews? I've seen a lot of fashion blogs review em

*[($$) Lazystyle](http://www.laztyle.com/) Cute tights/leggings

*[($$) Untitled Label](http://untitledlabel.com/sale) Simple stuff for cheap-ish

*[($$) Siren London](http://www.sirenlondon.com/) Cute dresses

*[($$) ShopSosie](http://www.shopsosie.com/) Not worth the cost in my opinion but maybe someone says otherwise.

*[($$) Modcloth](http://www.modcloth.com/) Overpriced dresses. If you look hard enough you can find it somewhere else for 10 dollars cheaper.

*[($$) Awwdore](http://www.awwdore.com/) Similar to Modcloth

*[($$) Evo](http://www.evo.com/shop/womens-shop.aspx) Pacsun-esque

*[($$) Dorothy Perkins](http://us.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=13065&amp;catalogId=34072&amp;geoip=home#slide2) A lot of people say that the sizing can be off but I have heard good things about this place.

*[($$) Goodnight Macaroon](http://www.shopgoodnightmacaroon.com/) Some cute stuff

*[($$) USTrendy](http://www.ustrendy.com/) It's a marketplace

*[($$) Brooklyn Industries](http://www.brooklynindustries.com/index.cfm) Modern and chic.

*[($$) Lace Affair](http://www.laceaffair.com/) Super awesome dresses that I'd love to buy but cannot afford.

*[($$) Chloe Loves Charlie](http://www.chloelovescharlie.com/Welcome.do;jsessionid=7C4D959E9E48C51A91B4813DE1AC60CE.prod2) Similar to Lace Affair. Very retro/vintage.

*[($$) Lulu's](http://www.lulus.com/) Probably one of the best dress stores. Prices range from 20-50 dollars but they have a huge selection

*[($$) Joe Brown's](http://www.joebrowns.co.uk/) Reviews?

*[($$) Sugarlips](http://www.sugarlips.com/shop/) I really have no idea how to navigate this site

[($$) J Crew Factory](http://factory.jcrew.com/index.jsp) slightly lower quality but significantly cheaper than J. Crew. Styles are about the same as J. Crew. Sweaters (particularly the cotton ones) appear cheaper quality, as well as 15% student discount.

*[($$) Necessary Clothing](http://www.necessaryclothing.com/) I've been to the New York store

[($$) Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/?) you get what you pay for. More ""traditional/sensible"" clothing for family. However

*[($$) Brandy Melville](http://www.brandymelvilleusa.com/) Cute rings.

*[($$$) Madewell](http://www.madewell.com/) Kind of like a really expensive Aerie in my opinion. I've heard that their jeans are amazing.

*[($$$) Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/) Classics. Any reviews?

*[($$$) Zara](http://www.zara.com/) slightly higher quality than H&amp;M but still not worth the price. Clothes are trendy
expensive, and I have things that needed zippers fixing, or darning. Generally good quality though, and if you don't go for the trendier stuff, lasts a while in terms of keeping up with fashion.

*[($$$) Mango](http://shop.mango.com/preHome.faces;jsessionid=563D422B2D86DB884EDBB7BA1141A441) Like a slightly-cheaper-but-not-really Zara.

*[($$$) Topshop](http://us.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=12556&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;geoip=home#slide1) Kind of like a more expensive version of ASOS. On par in terms of style.

[($$$) J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp) great quality, however. I suggest waiting for sales since they are frequent and plentiful. Have 15% student discount.

*[($$$) Shoppalu](http://shoppalu.com/) Not sure where it's based but they have really great vintage clothes

*[($$$) Stylenanda](http://www.stylenandaen.com/) very cute

*[($$$$) Desigual](http://www.desigual.com/en_US) Super-awesome

*[($$$$) Free People](http://www.freepeople.com/) Some really great stuff but it's so expensive that it hurts to look at. You can buy plenty of free people for a lot less at places like Karmaloop.

*[($$$$) Bird Motel](http://www.birdmotel.com.au/) Super-cute stuff

[Black Milk Clothing](http://blackmilkclothing.com/) WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW IN-LOVE I AM WITH ALL OF THESE. Careful of the import fees.

The dress: http://i.imgur.com/AhWNOBm.jpg

Me in the dress: http://i.imgur.com/XV8i9eN.jpg

I'm currently somewhat stuck about accessories

I can use it with and without the strap since it packs away

I've tried a few pairs of shoes but I'm feeling a little discouraged. I bought [these](http://www.elegantpark.com/product/Lovely-Round-Toes-Kitten-Heel-Lace-And-Satin-Wedding-Bridal-Shoes_p5176.html) thinking they might work and that was a horrible

I'm thinking of getting a feather wrap or shrug like [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/97190004/hollywood-vintage-glamour-marabou) just in case it is a cold day. I considered fur but honestly it just squicks me and all the fake fur shrugs I've seen look tacky as hell. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do with my makeup and hair. Maybe pin curls or finger curls? Birdcage or short [juliet cap veil](http://www.etsy.com/listing/115813803/crystal-rhinestone-cap-veil-juliet-cap)? Or perhaps just an updo with a flower? I know FFA isn't really the place to ask for hair and makeup stuff

Anyway

Measurements are 34 bust, so that makes me a pear. I am tall (5'10/5'11 or so) with a 34"" inseam. Shoe size 8.5. Boring brown hair. Coloring: damned if I know. Pale?

We were instructed to dress extra fancy last friday because were were meeting and presenting to important clients.   I wore a black suit (blazer and matching pencil skirt) and a cobalt blue shell under it and black pointed toe pumps.  I wore my hair up to look more professional.  All the men were wearing fancy suits and ties!

I felt more put together in my outfit but I dont think I felt or looked as powerful and professional as the men

I feel more put together in high heels but also vulnerable.  Flats are more comfy but I have never seen a pair if women's super professional looking flats like men wear - they different iterations of girly looking ballet flats.


There is nothing wrong with being girly or being a woman.  But I feel like they should make clothes for woman that make them look powerful and competent.  


Men look effortlessly fabulous in suits - what is the female equivalent?

1367799636.0,1drf2t,Closet Organization and Space Saving Tips,purplenat,164,18,38,"I have A LOT of clothes
  
**General tips:**  

1. Use ALL available space
2. Keep out-of-season (winter/summer) clothes out of the way
3. You’re more likely to wear something if you can see it
4. Keep 1-2 hooks empty for quick-n-dirty clean up
5. Don’t forget the backs of deep shelves
  
**Hanging Clothes:**  

- Install a second closet rod above your main one. This basically doubles your space. Buy a [stool]( http://www.amazon.com/Hardwood-Footstool-in-Espresso-Finish-12/dp/B00487NJCC/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_img_y) (my preference) or a [reaching rod]( http://www.amazon.com/Hanger-Hooker-Wooden-Handle--Reach/dp/B0027Z02ZY/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367782266&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=reaching+rod) for access. (Note: I have often done this myself on the cheap – check the interwebs for [tutorials]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimIOo_cuTA) or visit your local home improvement store.)
- Matching hangers makes everything [look so nice]( http://i.imgur.com/FR1afdx.jpg). I have [these Joy Mangano ones]( http://www.hsn.com/shop/huggable-hangers/jm0001) and I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. I bought a 200-pack or something like that when it was on special. Worth it. 
- [Cascading hooks]( http://www.hsn.com/products/joy-mangano-huggable-hangers-set-of-20-cascading-hooks/6580911) are [bloody genius]( http://i.imgur.com/6fA9Yp3.jpg) and work with almost any hanger. Use [two at a time]( http://i.imgur.com/NvKEJYi.jpg)!
- You can get a [tiered hanger]( http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6021-185-Chrome-Collection-Folding/dp/B000L1KN14/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) for skirts. [Mine]( http://i.imgur.com/YZhQVcu.jpg) is over 30 years old and still going strong.
- I have yet to find the perfect single skirt hanger commercially available
  
**Folded Clothes:**  

- Fold all [knit items]( http://www.onelittleminuteblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/knit-fabric-overview-one-little-minute-blog-knits-vs-wovens.jpg) to prevent [hanger bumps]( http://www.refinery29.com/static/bin/entry/ea8/x/67793/hanger.jpg). That includes sweaters
- Got deep shelves? Fold clothes [appropriately]( http://coderedhat.com/how-fold-towels/). If you still have space behind your folded clothes (i.e. really deep shelves) store your out-of-season sandals/sweaters back there. (Tip 2 &amp; 5 combo!)
- If you are using a dresser or other drawers, PJs, and even underwear! BTW, [folding]( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KADP9oTF2ro/TpeNScLtMDI/AAAAAAAABBY/DKz4z6UywS4/s1600/fold+panties+collage.jpg) your [underwear](http://www.carlaanne.com/2012/09/folding-football-underwear/)saves space but people may call you OCD – weigh your options wisely. 
- For open shelving
- Feel free to use [extra shelving]( http://www.amazon.com/Grayline-40710-Jumbo-Kitchen-Helper/dp/B000LNVXIY/ref=pd_sim_hg_5) in already existing [shelves]( http://i.imgur.com/zKigKtl.jpg). 
  
**Shoes &amp; Boots:**  

- Use an [over-the-door]( http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6486-1746-WHT-Over-The-Door-White-36-Pair/dp/B0019FOUQ0/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367780439&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=over+the+door+shoe+organizer) shoe organizer - I like these better than [hang-in-the-closet]( http://www.amazon.com/Household-Essentials-20-Pocket-Hanging-Organizer/dp/B00475AUJA/ref=sr_1_8?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367780439&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=over+the+door+shoe+organizer) versions because hanging space is so valuable. Ideally
- Small cheap [bookshelves]( http://www.amazon.com/Furinno-99736EX-Bookcase-Bookshelf-Bookshelves/dp/B004S6JGR0/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338902849&amp;sr=1-1) are great for [boots]( http://i.imgur.com/kTXBYOC.jpg). Check your local craislist for cheapies.
- Some people love keeping their original shoe boxes
  
**Bags:**  

- Stuff bags with tissue to keep their shape. When using a bag
- Sit them [on a shelf]( http://i.imgur.com/4Y9KQKm.jpg) rather than hanging them to prevent handles from [stretching out]( http://www.handbagheaven.com/blog/handbag-storage-how-to-maintain-your-purses-condition/3146/).
- Use [bookends] (http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Economy-Bookends-Standard-Heavy/dp/B001E6CT8A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338902573&amp;sr=8-1) to keep them up. I [built my own]( http://i.imgur.com/jh1Elu3.jpg).
- If you must hang
- For less often used bags
- I love having a junk bowl/[box]( http://i.imgur.com/cWwkJeE.jpg)/space for the things that I often but not always keep in my purse like hand sanitizer or a different sized wallet.
  
**Other Accessories:**  

- Hang scarves on [towel racks]( http://www.amazon.com/Decko-Products-38120-Towel-12-Inch/dp/B000UETBII/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367793608&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=towel+rod) – you can get one for less than $4 at your local home improvement store. I have two on the [inside of a closet door]( http://i.imgur.com/PTtV2Co.jpg)
- For [belts]( http://i.imgur.com/0UxrlW0.jpg), and basically everything else ever, buy some [screw in hooks]( http://www.amazon.com/16-PC-1-5-Metal-Cup-Hooks/dp/B006IMJ59Q/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367793748&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=screw+in+hooks) in bulk at the home improvement store, and leave no wall or cabinet space uncovered. (Tips 1 &amp; 5) These are also very handy in the kitchen. They work best if you drill a hole first.
- Corral smaller items into open [boxes
- Items that you intend to use infrequently can be hidden away in [boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/9UJZz8c.jpg). Those are Ikea, and hats. 
  
**Creating More Space:**  

- Buy an [armoire](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/100580672?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=wardrobe&amp;storeId=10051&amp;N=5yc1v&amp;R=100580672#.UYbmfaKG2jM) - [that’s what I did!](http://i.imgur.com/ONXHgDW.jpg).
- Are you handy? [Build a closet in a corner]( http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Closet)! 
- Only kind of handy? Get a stud-finder, a shelf and closet rod. [Install brackets]( http://woodworking.about.com/od/woodworkingplansdesigns/ss/UtilityShelves.htm), add shelf on top, slip  rod into place (that’s what she said). Beware of how much your wardrobe weighs; you may need more than two of those brackets. Note: I once installed just the shelf, then had a towel rod underneath for scarves, and below was the boots bookshelf. 
- Get a [freestanding rack](http://www.amazon.com/Alera-Wire-Shelving-Garment-Black/dp/B004I2IFGM/ref=pd_sim_hg_2). I have one in my pantry for coats. Whatever
  
  
Many of the photos are of my current storage situation which includes [two separate closets]( http://i.imgur.com/qw6TPUU.jpg) and an [enormous armoire]( http://i.imgur.com/ONXHgDW.jpg)

I thought it might be fun to share our own hidden hints and tips - the things that go on under or in our outfits that help everything fit better, hold together for the day and so on. In particular the things that are hidden, and probably not noticeable and so some of us might not have thought of them for our own outfits. I don't think there is anything too obvious for this thread!

One of my own is that in winter

I find it helps me with smoother lines and helps that bottom layer stay in place and not slip around. 

That

I look forward to picking up some tips I'd never thought of.

As part of the moderator's efforts to broaden the scope of the FFA Community and encourage diversification of the subreddit we're making an attempt to expand the sidebar and bring it more in-line with the quantity of information offered by our male subreddit-in-arms, and women tend to be more educated than men when it comes to knowing how items should fit, patterns should match, etc. 

With that said


An Introduction to Designer Fashion
---
___
To many, and [seemingly arbitrary decisions about what's ""trending"" from one season to the next](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LVptO7o4L8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=109s). For others, it's a reminder of the 00 supermodels of the 90s and seen as inaccessible to anyone with a less than perfect physique.

These views are wrong.

That is not to say there's not a kernel of truth to these thoughts - they certainly have their basis in reality - but that they reflect a certain lack of awareness about the subject. Just as many a viewing of a Pollock or Mondrian has elicited comments of ""My five year old could do this"" or ""it's just colouring inside the lines!"", to retailer. We hope this guide will provide you with that information and spur a further interest or, if nothing else, introduce you to a new topic
___
Two Seasons
---
___
The fashion calendar revolves around two major seasons: **Autumn/Winter** and **Spring/Summer**. The former may in some cases be referred to as Fall/Winter. The beginning and end of each season is marked by Fashion Weeks in the fashion ""capitals"" of Paris, and New York \[[2](There are others, but the major ones are of the most import)\]. Typically the seasons are shortened to either **AW** or **SS** when used in conjunction with a year, i.e an Autumn/Winter 2009 collection by Yohji Yamamoto might be written as YY AW09.

With womenswear Spring/Summer shows typically occur in September and Fall/Winter shows happen in February. To stay up to date on what's happening sites such as [NowFashion](http://nowfashion.com) offer live photo uploads during shows and publish the full show schedules about a week in advance. They also have an extensive archive of past season shows and lookbooks. Alternatives include [Style.com](http://www.style.com/)

For photos of runway shows dating back to 2001, a subscription service for runway photography; they are akin to the Getty Images of the Fashion world.

Additionally, they tend to start roughly three months after the main season.
___
Couture v. Prêt-à-porter
---
___
Runway shows are divided into two categories. These are Prêt-à-Porter, literally ""high sewing"".

As its name implies, and the looks put together are intended to convey a message or give the viewer deeper insight into the designer's aesthetic universe. This lends to the misconception that all designer clothing is ""outlandish"" or ""absurd"". However, in most cases it's not expected that people will wear looks from the show straight onto the street. For an excellent example of the contrast between on-the-street and on-the-runway looks, compare a look from Rick Owen's most recent [Fall/Winter 2011 Show](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/AW2011%20-%20Rick%20Owens%20-%2029.jpg) to [a streetstyle photo of it](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/im%20koo%20rick%20example.jpg). [Other examples](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/divinitius%20rick%20example.jpg). One designer well known for presenting [highly practical, workable looks](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wilr1h64r1omwgy/7sU_BYIQ4r) is Phoebe Philo, who is currently the head designer of Céline.

Haute Couture is very different. To be an official courtier

* Design made-to-order for private clients

* Have a workshop (atelier) in Paris that employs at least fifteen people full-time.

* Must have 20 full time technical people in at least one atelier or workshop.

* Each season (i.e., comprising at least thirty-five runs/exits with outfits for both daytime wear and evening wear.

Garments are made by hand

Boutiques
---
___
Should you find a piece you are interested in purchasing you may find yourself stymied by the complexity of doing so. While the largest houses, Balenciaga, et al have their own flagship Locations, they will also sell a subset of their line in upscale department stores such as Barneys, Nordstrom, and Saks. Smaller brands are usually found at boutiques and lack their own storefronts or webshop. 

Further complicating matters

* [Acrimony in SF](http://www.shopacrimony.com/)
* [Aloha Rag in HI](http://www.aloharag.com)
* [Totokaelo in Seattle](http://totokaelo.com/)
* [Bonnie and Clyde's in Chicago](http://www.bonnieandclydes.com/) \[ [*](Temporarily closed) \]
* [Opening Ceremony in LA &amp; NY](http://www.openingceremony.us/)
* [OakNYC](http://www.oaknyc.com/)


For Canada (mix of web/retail locations):

* [Ssense](http://www.ssense.com/)
* [Roden Gray](http://www.rodengray.com/)
* [Haven](http://havenshop.ca/)
* [reborn](http://reborn.ws)

In Europe it is easier to just ring up a brand's flagship and speak with an SA to order an item. For those who prefer to shop online

* [LN-CC](http://www.ln-cc.com/)
* [Layers](http://www.layerslondon.com/)

Not to be forgotten are the largest online shops:

* [ForwardForward](http://www.forwardforward.com/fw/DesignerIndex.jsp?d=Womens)
* [The Corner](http://www.thecorner.com/)
* [Luisa via Roma](http://www.luisaviaroma.com/)
* [Net-a-Porter \(NAP)](http://www.net-a-porter.com/)
* [YOOX](http://yoox.com)
* [The Outnet](http://www.theoutnet.com/)


These are not exhaustive lists but a jumping off point. Google will be your friend, who many boutiques outsource their online shopping to.

1373290013.0,1hv1pa,The Formality Level of Your Office or Interview,thethirdsilence,143,15,83,"As you may have noticed, I will review some contextual factors that will help you determine what is appropriate for the office. 

Women’s office attire can be seen as along a spectrum:

Suits &gt; suiting separates mixed with non-suits &gt; traditional business casual &gt; khakis

Within this spectrum, friendlier color palettes. If you are in a creative industry, you may have more room for self-expression (colorful suits and funky cuts or skinny as opposed to straight leg jeans) than you do in banking. 

Factors that dictate formality:

-**Location**: some cities are more conservative than others. In general, and suits are mandatory, whereas everyone wears jeans to their West Coast branch.  Additionally, the rules may be different in big cities than in small towns—if you interview for a nonprofit job in DC, you had better wear a suit, whereas khakis might work well in Burlington, VT. 
 
(As you may notice, but I don’t feel qualified to comment on global business dress codes. I would especially welcome international readers to weigh in on how true any advice I provide this week is for their location.)

-**Industry**: some industries are much more formal than others, and consulting firms (“white shoe” firms) as well as folks in law who interview for clerkships, are the most formal. Government, pharmacueticals, accounting, and law and business jobs are next in terms of formality. Generally, nonprofits, social media, for instance. Tech and engineering tends to be a bit less formal. 

-**Your Role/Your Goal**- You’ve probably heard the old adage “dress for the job you want, if your work is client or customer facing, you may need to be dressier than if you are working in a backroom. If you are more junior within the company, you also may want to err on the safe side in your clothing choices. In my old job, we once had an informally planned “hoodie Friday.” I had gotten promoted three weeks before this event, and my boss, who had been with the employer for 8 years, I’m going to wear a hoodie tomorrow but I don’t think you should.” To some extent

**But I’m still not sure how formal my work place is.**

Here are some other cues that may help you:

-How do the other people in your workplace dress? Here, least appropriate thing any one has ever worn to the office (But my coworker wears sheer things all the time!). Look for patterns and look for role models. If you work with mostly men, you can still take queues about your own dress from their dress (I will review this more in Thursday’s post on troubleshooting office problems).  For instance, if men wear suits and ties every day, the office is NOT business casual.

 *A cardigan is not the female equivalent of a suit jacket.* Cardigans can be a useful business casual staple but are not formal enough for a workplace where men wear suits every day. 

(I use men’s dress as a reference point throughout this guide. I know this could be irritating—why should women’s dress be defined with men’s dress as a reference point? However because the degrees of formality are more clear

-What is your official dress code? It may help you clarify what is expected in your workplace.

-Ask your manager or a more senior coworker what is appropriate. Any manager would rather lay out expectations than lecture or send home an employee. 

 -Who do you meet with? First, I sometimes met with lawyers and government officials, and wore suits. Other days, I met with folks who worked at nonprofits and felt free to wear more colors and patterns. When I met with farmers I tended to dress down a bit.
Second, you should dress like one. If you are presenting yourself as a friendly peer, less formal clothing may be helpful.  

If you work in client-facing work with marginalized communities

Stay tuned for tomorrow’s post on Suits and Interviewing and see what else is in store [this week](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ht3r2/officewear_and_interview_series/).

I've really enjoyed looking at inspiration albums focused on a single article of clothing in the past (e.g. Nike Freespiration album the other day!)

However

* extremely preppy fits ~~although Jenna Lyons is in there~~. Button down + sweater + chunky necklace is kind of formulaic (nothing wrong with that

* anything that was explicitly ""officewear""

* oversized button-downs worn in Mediterranean vacation shoots as beach cover-ups and the many different tumblr-esque iterations thereof because . . . nah. 

I looked for things that played with the structural elements of the shirt. I really love the clean line the placket creates when it's buttoned all the way up, but hopefully I managed to cover a pretty broad swath of styles, with the unifying element being a certain purposefulness with which the shirt is worn, whether it's the focus or just a supporting element of a fit.

",11,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/vrgrm/dispelling_the_myths_of_fashion_episode_one_the/,"Hello, ladies (and gents).

For a long time

You’ve seen it:

* ""Are _________ back in again?""

* ""Is it okay for me to wear _________

* ""Are _________ last season?""

* ""_______ is the new ________.""

I figure this perception of fashion is propagated by newcomers to fashion who are basing their perception on depictions of the industry on film and television. Catty editors

    “Don’t-a stomp your little last season Prada shoes at me

            – Legally Blonde

In reality, the harsh reality is that barely any people in this subreddit are wearing designer clothing to begin with—so “seasons” barely even matter. It’s easier to recognize a past-season Givenchy dog shirt than a graphic tee by Merona from Target.)

(The notable deviation from this rule is vintage clothing

Certain styles and items experience fluctuations in popularity. Bob haircuts, etc. Instead of focusing on whether or not what you want/have is “in season” or “in style,” you should be focusing on:

1. Whether it **works for you**: Far too many people force themselves into trends that simply do not work for them. We call them “fashion victims.” Blunt bangs, crop tops, ostrich pants, or John Lennon sunglasses. Know yourself, and stick to your guns. Don’t blindly follow every trend that peaks in popularity.

2. Whether it has reached **the point of saturation**: Sometimes it’s probably just too late to jump on the bandwagon. And a lot of times, and Jeffrey Campbell Litas.

Don’t get me wrong—it’s okay to rock maxi skirts (or any of the other above-mentioned trends) if you want to

In conclusion: Don’t fall victim to the exaggerations of “in” and “out.” Don’t worry about wearing your older purchases (if they still look good). And most importantly, and your personal style. Draw inspiration and take heed of trends, but don’t become a victim to them.

Gone are the days of puffy sleeves on brides and sea foam green monstrosities on bridesmaids. Weddings have evolved from a highly structured event into a unique event tailored to each specific couple. They range from super casual backyard barbeques to extremely formal black tie events held in ballrooms. Brides are no longer sticking to white dresses; They’re wearing red, it can become quite confusing for a person trying to find a dress to wear as a guest of a wedding. I’m hoping this guide will clear up any questions you have about shopping for dresses to wear to a wedding. 

When going to a wedding

Your ensemble will largely be determined by how formal the wedding is and by what the couple says on the invitation. The four main wedding types are listed below along with what is appropriate to wear to each type. I’m using dresses from David’s Bridal as examples because most of you are American and this is a brand that most of you have access to. 

**Black Tie**

* Wear a formal floor-length gown
  
* Furs are acceptable 
 
* Wear glitzy jewelry
  
* Shiny fabric is preferred but not mandatory
  
* Opera gloves are acceptable 

* A short train is acceptable

-	Shiny fabric is preferred but not mandatory

**Semi-Formal*** 

* Wear a cocktail-length dress

* Wear either shiny or matte fabric

**Casual** 

* Wear a cocktail-length dress
* Matte fabric is preferred but not mandatory

**Venue and Time** 

The venue and time of day have a very small influence on your outfit. It’s really just the bridesmaids dresses that have to be a specific style for the venue and time of day. For a garden or beach wedding you should try to wear something in a more lightweight fabric like georgette or chiffon

**Colors**

Wearing black has become more acceptable in recent years. If you’re going to wear black to a wedding

In regards to ivory, err on the side of caution. 

**Length**

I’m not going to make any silly rules about the dress touching your knees or being a certain amount of inches. The thing to keep in mind about length is that you’re going to be dancing. Wear a dress that you can dance in comfortably without having to worry about exposing yourself.

**Straps vs. Strapless**

As mentioned above, cardigan, or long sleeved dress. 

**Neckline**

Use common sense for this one. Your dress should be tasteful but not matronly. It’s fine to show a little bit of cleavage as long as you make sure that your nipples will not pop out and your cleavage will not steal the attention away from your beautiful face.

**Shoes**

There is no rule regarding the height of your heels. You can wear 6 inch heels if you feel like it as long as you are able to dance in them. I recommend wearing a thicker heel if the ceremony is outdoors as stilettos will sink into grass or sand and you run the risk of toppling over. 

**Religious Weddings**

Wear something more conservative to a religious ceremony. You should cover your shoulders and wear a dress that falls just below the knees. There will be specific dress codes for each religious group and I can’t name them all. This is something that you will have to google. 

**Further Notes**

Every wedding is different and you know your friends better than I do. The things that I have said in this guide are not set in stone; you should use your judgement. You’re welcome to pm me if you are still unsure about a certain dress. Make sure you include the formality of the wedding and as many details as you can. 

Edit: I was asked to include more casual dresses since that is what most people are looking for.

Once or twice a week, and sometimes I'll pick something basic and you get to dress it up.  Sometimes I may even throw in an extra (optional) condition to make it challenging, like how would you wear this: in the summer?  on a date?  if you could only pick two other items?  if you were in a hurry that morning?  etc.

Proposed rules:


* Sometimes you won't like the item chosen.  Maybe it's not your style.  But that's the point.  You may either abstain
* Downvote sparingly.  If someone gives an honest answer for how they would actually wear it
* Are you a fashion newbie?  You should definitely participate!  Don't feel like you have to sit out because you aren't an 'expert.'  Give it a shot
* Men
* If you have a photo of your inspiration, too.

I'm open to more suggestions for rules and such.  What do you guys think?  I think it could be fun and could fuel for discussion

If you're at all interested in the topic

This is somewhat complementary to the [French Wardrobe](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15yf1z/the_french_wardrobe_thread_2curating_a_wardrobe/) buying philosophy I've previously talked about.

***

## Why do a minimalist wardrobe challenge?

**One of the problems endemic to fashion/style communities online is that we get used to the idea that we always have to shop more, since it keeps the fashion industry going). Fashion bloggers, by and large, talk a *lot* about new items they've acquired and showcase brand-new outfits all the time. I feel it's easy to forget that we're seeing a very artificial impression of an ideal wardrobe or someone else's wardrobe—one that's based around constant novelty.

The reality is that many of us *won't* have gigantic

* **To see an alternative to buying more and feeling dissatisfied with what we already have**. We've talked before about how [participating in the fashion community online makes it easier to spend](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1bixva/the_dilemma_of_frequenting_fashion_forumsblogs/)
* **To figure out what pieces in our wardrobes matter the most.** It's nice to be reminded of the types of garments (or specific garments!) that heavily influence our wardrobe and are perhaps most useful and versatile. If you come out of a challenge feeling that you had a distinct lack of blouses or your shoes weren't particularly versatile
* **To help us pare down our wardrobes and consumption.** It may help to be reminded that we don't need *that much* clothing to create a good amount of variety in our outfits—as long as the outfits are well-chosen. 
* **Restrictions can allow for greater creativity**. It's easy to fall into the trap of having tons of clothing and feeling like you have nothing to wear—having forced restrictions might allow you to see more possibilities in what you own.

So now that I've introduced the topic

***

## Project 333

**The challenge is to wear only 33 items for 3 months.** This could be great if you're trying to pare down your wardrobe significantly and want a test period to work within the challenge restrictions and get used to a small wardrobe. It's a bit more of a long-term commitment (the other challenge is shorter if you feel nervous!).

Obviously, it may be a little easier to plan things out.

Project 333 was started by a woman who writes a minimalist living blog

## The 30x30 Remix

**The challenge is to create 30 different outfits out of 30 pieces**

The 30x30 remix was started by the blogger behind [Kendi Everyday](http://www.kendieveryday.com/p/30x30-remix.html) (many other stylebloggers have done this challenge as well). Her blog shows examples of the pieces and outfits she did from her previous challenge attempts

***

## The rules:

Project 333 has clearly defined rules; the 30x30 Remix doesn't. For the intent of the challenges (pushing yourself to discover the potential in a small wardrobe)

* **What counts**: clothing
* **What doesn't count**: accessories and jewelry, workout clothing. For women whose professional wardrobes *hardly* intersect with their casual/everyday wardrobes, I'd suggest having your exclusively-workwear pieces not count as well

Note: accessories and jewelry are counted as part of your 33 items in the official Project 333 rules—but my impression is that many FFAers, necklaces, belts, &amp;c in their wardrobes.

**On downvoting and reddiquette**
---
/u/PersonalShopper (RIP) disabled downvotes in the custom subreddit style; however, using mobile platforms) and downvotes were as much of a problem as ever. In fact, the lack of downvotes led to confusion, more hurt feelings, and, we thought, abuse of the downvote as a feature. Some of you may have noticed, it is obvious that we need to discuss a few specific points from Reddiquette in terms of how **not** to use the downvote button.

So

* **Don't mass downvote someone else's posts.** 
* **Don't upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.**

These should be fairly self-explanatory, good advice or bad (not that downvotes should be used for bad advice - more on that later). This makes the community hostile, makes newcomers and oldtimers alike feel alienated and bullied, and is immature beyond belief. If you don't like someone, let them be. If you think someone's advice is bad, *explain to them why you disagree or let it be.* If a post is off-topic or offensive, use the [report button](http://i.imgur.com/SSar5AW.png) and also [message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/x7KWU46.png) so we're notified of it.

**On giving and receiving criticism**
---
The name of this subreddit is Female Fashion *Advice.* While we've expanded into discussions of personal style, it's important to note that many, if not all users, approach this subreddit with the idea of giving advice in mind. With that being said, don't be offended if someone takes a critical eye to your advice, your outfit, your style, bluntness, feel free to take advantage of the report/message moderators functionalities. Take and give criticism like a reasonable

**On novelty/parody accounts**
---
Novelty and parody accounts are, offensive, off-topic, etc., using what is clearly a novelty account, you are still being reasonable by reporting their comments. While they can inject a wonderful dose of humor into our discussions, users should not hide behind novelty accounts in order to be rude or overly harsh, rational adult human. 

**On FFA as a ""safe space""**
---
A recent conversation about body type (and [""boyishness""](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1dfs0k/hey_ffa_can_we_stop_describing_womens_bodies_as/) in particular) led to many wondering - is FFA a ""safe space"" à la, mature, reasonably politically correct way, but our intention is primarily to discuss fashion and fashion advice. Issues of body image and self-confidence are often tied up in issues much deeper than how we look on the surface, and this community is not designed to work through those deeper issues. You will likely be directed to a more appropriate subreddit if you're experiencing those issues, though we are always happy to help you change your style, dress for events

**On community and cliqueishness**
---
Many of the Moderators, and try to keep in-crowd jokes to a minimum. This can be very unwelcoming for newcomers or those who don't spend as much time hanging around FFA. It is our intention that the community be welcoming to all, and those who have been around the longest or the most can do a lot to make the community feel that way.

Now on to the nitty gritty.

****

There are many

**Types of shoes**

* Sandals: Typically, such as [flip flops](http://i.imgur.com/mFqtf.jpg) (with a simple strap and minimal design) or [gladiators](http://i.imgur.com/VPHKp.jpg) (involving multiple cross-straps that often extend upward past the ankle). Sandals are often embellished with jewels, braiding, multi-material straps, and other details.

* Boots: “Boots” is an all-encompassing category that includes many, the calf, and occasionally, the knee and thigh. Boots can also be heeled or wedged. Some types of boots are:

    [Riding boots](http://i.imgur.com/oVI7f.jpg): Usually minimalist in design; a smooth

    [Rain boots/galoshes/wellies/whatever you want to call them](http://i.imgur.com/cc0lo.jpg): Pretty self-explanatory. Try to look for pairs with a thinner shaft (the part that covers the calf).

    [Booties](http://i.imgur.com/W30Qj.jpg): “Booties” is a descriptive word for boots with shorter shafts, or flat.

    [Combat boots](http://i.imgur.com/K1RYt.jpg): Think punk and rough and tumble. Combat boots are characterized by their military feel—rough construction, but some brands like Dr. Martens make novelty pairs that extend very high on the leg.

    [Cowboy boots](http://i.imgur.com/iWmUe.jpg): Everyone knows what these are. They are usually high in the shaft (although some pairs come ankle-height) and pointy in the toe with a small heel. Almost always made of leather, studs, etc. 

    [Engineer boots](http://i.imgur.com/F08q0.jpg): Stereotypical of a “chunkier, a rounded toe, a strap across the bottom of the shaft, and a slight heel. Frye is a very popular brand for engineer boots. These are stereotypical motorcyclist boots.

    [Desert boots](http://i.imgur.com/1grsy.jpg): If you’ve ever visited MFA

    [Chelsea boots](http://i.imgur.com/3uyex.jpg): A snug

    ~~Uggs~~: Fuck Uggs.

* Heels: a huge umbrella term for any type of shoe with an elevated heel

* Sneakers/athletic: A genre of shoes that includes running shoes (which should only be worn for exercise, casual styles like [plimsolls](http://i.imgur.com/aGegk.jpg) (a lighter sneaker characterized by its canvas upper and rubber sole—very typical of spring and summer), [slip-ons](http://i.imgur.com/VFPta.jpg), more athletic/streetwear styles like [Nikes](http://i.imgur.com/PkpYK.jpg), and classics like good ol’ [Chuck Taylors](http://i.imgur.com/ELGHs.jpg).

* Flats: This is the section I’ve been dreading. There are just so many types of flats
 
    [Classic ballerinas](http://i.imgur.com/LMqFn.jpg): BEWARE—though often touted as the “classic staple” of a woman’s shoe collection

    [Loafers](http://i.imgur.com/lrjrx.jpg): Laceless

Womens shoes also have many features. Here is a basic list of the most common features you will see:

* [D’orsay](http://i.imgur.com/wcV9A.jpg): A shoe in which the heel and toe components are separate

* [Ankle strap](http://i.imgur.com/t3xH8.jpg): Self-explanatory (also

* [T-strap](http://i.imgur.com/GuIb3.jpg): Exactly as it sounds--a “T” shaped strap that wraps around the ankle and extends down the top of the foot to the toe

* [Pointed toe](http://i.imgur.com/CIrvW.jpg)

* [Platform](http://i.imgur.com/VKm07.jpg): The section under the toe; adds extra height without straining the foot

* [Sling back](http://i.imgur.com/cXl8K.jpg): A strap that extends around the heel on a shoe with no counter (very 90’s Ally McBeal; hard to pull off without looking dated)

* [Cap toe](http://i.imgur.com/N1Jso.jpg): A “cap” on the toe (obviously); can be in a contrast color or simply defined by broguing

* [Espadrille](http://i.imgur.com/KQZIm.jpg): A shoe with a sole made of rope (typically with a canvas upper

* [Toe ring](http://i.imgur.com/zD2O9.jpg)

* [Slouch](http://i.imgur.com/geDVU.jpg): Ugh. See far below.

* [Saddle](http://i.imgur.com/baVbH.jpg): An oxford with a decorative panel in the middle of the shoe

* [Spectator](http://i.imgur.com/FsOvL.jpg): Sort of the opposite of the saddle shoe

* [Broguing](http://i.imgur.com/Dp9xk.jpg): Perforations

* [Monk strap](http://i.imgur.com/bx6pW.jpg) (double monk shown here): A strap and buckle that crosses the upper of a shoe

* [Mary jane](http://i.imgur.com/1lKgz.jpg): A shoe with a cross strap, and nearly universally grotesque style of shoe, if we’re being honest here. [Example of a mary jane heel](http://i.imgur.com/DfCMW.jpg)

**Materials**

* [Leather](http://i.imgur.com/iQhxm.jpg)

* [Patent leather](http://i.imgur.com/qJgbj.jpg): A shiny

**General Don’ts** (Major Don'ts in the general fashion community)

* [Slouch](http://i.imgur.com/geDVU.jpg): The absolute bane of women’s shoe’s existence. Somehow this style of shoe has gained huge traction within the general public

* [Kitten heels](http://i.imgur.com/9I1TY.jpg): Unflattering for the legs and generally not very attractive at all

* Crocs (obviously)

* [Overly rounded toes](http://i.imgur.com/Rgdia.jpg): Look very juvenile and unflattering on any foot or leg shape

* Mary jane flats (see above)

* Running shoes (for obvious reasons)

* Uggs (no explanation necessary)

* [Flip-flops](http://i.imgur.com/mFqtf.jpg): Shouldn’t be worn except for functional reasons

**Please come in and share thoughts on gender and fashion**. I've noted some particular questions of interest below

***

**How does society present fashion differently for men and women?** I think many MFAers are familiar with the old chestnut that women *intrinsically* know more about fashion and style. But from the FFA side, has developed a unique personal style, and has a standard of fashion awareness and taste that many women feel trapped by.

**How does the culture differ around men's fashion and women's fashion?**

I've addressed this somewhat above; would like to add the question of how men approach shopping versus how women approach shopping. My impression is that women's fashion culture is strongly influenced by the fact that *shopping is a social pastime*, quality of construction, longevity…

Another point of interest in this discussion—use of male models in womenswear

**How is fashion a method to enforce gender norms and identity?** It's so interesting to see how MFA advice posts will often say ""I have childbearing hips"" in an apologetic way—*in clothes I exhibit what seems a more feminine shape and I am escaping this*. We've had discussions on FFA about using the term ""boyish"" to describe figure

So what does that change about men's fashion culture given that more people are assumed to be new to it? Isn't it unfair that we expect women to be intrinsically more informed? How do the standards on what women know about fashion help or hinder us? 

It's interesting how the borrowing is very one-way—I personally don't know of many situations where womenswear tropes were borrowed effectively and with popular adoption in menswear. Does anyone else know? Thoughts on this dynamic?

I am happy to build a quality wardrobe with sale items, I have a (perhaps misguided) belief that I should be able buy a dress, a pair of jeans, or a sweater that will last 5-10 years. 

This belief is based on the fact that I am currently weeding out my H&amp;M and Forever 21 items purchased in 2005-2009 from my closet, if I can keep these things looking decent for 4-8 years, I can certainly work with a $150 item to make it last just as long or longer. I certainly have a pair of Joe's jeans that I purchased in 2009 for $120 that still look brand spanking new, and I feel comfortable continuing to purchase from that brand in the future with the belief that those items will last forever if I'm careful.

So my question is, aside from sales or thrift stores, when they are done with fast fashion but are unable to purchase designer pieces? Is anyone else in this ""zone"" with me?

** *


**What can I sell?** Apparel, though accessories like scarves and jewelry can often be sold as well.  Policies will vary from store to store – some stores only accept certain brands, while others will consider anything.  Call the store before you bring your items in to check what brands they accept.

**When should I sell?** Stores will be much more likely to buy items that are seasonally appropriate.  Consignment shops have limited space and will often turn down items that can’t be sold in the coming months – so don’t try and sell your shorts in December or your wool coat in May.  Early autumn (August/September) and early spring (March/April) are great times to start clearing out items for the coming season.  Trendier items should be sold while they’re still current

**What condition should my items be in?** Everything should be *clean* and in *good condition*.  Many stores will accept anything from new with tags (NWT) to gently used, damaged, or heavily worn items; unless it’s a designer piece, a damaged item is usually not worth reselling.  A handful of high-end boutiques require all items to be dry cleaned with cleaning tags attached.

**How much will I get?** Unfortunately

**Why didn’t they buy any of my stuff?** So you tried a store or two

* not in style

* not in season

* not a notable brand

* uncommonly sized or altered

* worn or damaged.

Your only options now are to donate what’s left (please do not donate heavily damaged items – this is both disrespectful and a hassle to charities)

**Where can I do this?**  There are only a handful of national chain consignment stores –[Buffalo Exchange](http://www.buffaloexchange.com/), and [Second Time Around](http://www.secondtimearound.net) come to mind.  However, there are many small boutiques that vary from city to city.  Your best bet is to Google consignment shops in your city and call around to see what they accept.  Keywords to try:  consignment, resale, vintage, used clothing.   If you can’t find anything in your area, try selling to one of the online shops below.

**Tops**   
* [Merona V-Necks.](http://imgur.com/xMQKJ)  $8  I suggest at least one white and one black. These are perfect for casual dates with jeans or bridal showers tucked into a skirt with a sweater.  
* A Good Blouse (or two). Here are a few I like for around $30: [1](http://imgur.com/DmYwv), [4](http://imgur.com/3lv6a) *Note*: Bare shoulders should be covered by a sweater in most business settings. When in doubt, cover them up.  
* [Cardigan Sweaters.](http://imgur.com/Fudir)  $30  Every woman should have at least one in white, not too baggy. Don't be afraid to try colorful ones, or experiment with ruffles/prints/beading/size!

**Dresses**  
* For Work. [This.](http://imgur.com/XLbkz) [Or This.](http://imgur.com/XLbkz) Both are $30. When wearing a dress to work think of the high school fingertip rule. Nothing shorter than that is appropriate. Remember that bare shoulders may require a sweater. Also
* For Weddings/Family Brunch/Lunch Meetings. [This.](http://imgur.com/0PoZb) [Or This.](http://imgur.com/ykGoU) Both are $35. Depending on the situation

**Bottoms**  
* Jeans. Jeans are a very important part of a woman's wardrobe. Most of us do everything in our jeans. I can't tell each woman to wear the same pair of jeans, try a few more just in case. Don't be afraid to get a pair tailored. Fit the thighs and have the waist taken in, or get ""longs"" and have them hemmed an inch. Be patient, your perfect pair of jeans is out there. Also, jeans are something you may want to splurge on. Dropping $70-100 on a good pair of quality jeans is a good investment.  
* [Wide Leg Trousers.](http://imgur.com/JaQbD)  $70  Besides jeans, flattering to all, and professional.   
* Skirts. Similar to jeans in that every woman and every body type needs a different skirt. Keep these things in mind for appropriateness: length and print. Here are a few I like: [1](http://imgur.com/ZzAdb)

**Accessories**  
* [Fake Diamond and Pearl Earrings.](http://imgur.com/5DarZ) You can worry about getting the real thing later. $3  
* A Watch. This can be faked
* A Pendant Necklace. [1](http://imgur.com/KzGG1) and [2](http://imgur.com/faaWF)This can break up a dress or skirt outfit in the same way a belt does. 

**Shoes**  
* Flats. A very good staple for any young woman on the go. Some examples: [1](http://imgur.com/hoSjj) [2](http://imgur.com/4ThS6) [3](http://imgur.com/5haOl)  
* Heels. Every woman should have a pair in black and a pair in brown or nude. [Black](http://imgur.com/hJVUE) [Brown](http://imgur.com/iaWo5)

* Trolling

Reasons *not* to downvote someone

* Because you don't like ""hipster"" fashion (or whatever look is being discussed)

I'd also like to address that it seems like half of FFA thinks we're too critical, instead of paying attention to the trend at hand.  Anyway, that's just how I feel on the matter.

I was wondering if we could do something like [Brands: Caution](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/lnr90/brands_a_cautionary_overview/) like they have at MFA

It would be great to have some kind or repository of sizing notes and what body types brands are good for.

EDIT: updates are below

EDIT: Hey folks, don't just down vote them. Would like to get as many viewpoints as possible here.

Thanks ladies! Let's keep this going. Would love to hear about ASOS and BlackMilk since those are two places I've been thinking about ordering from at some point.


* **American Apparel** Quality is declining.

* **American Eagle Outfitters** Jeans are good for short girls. Runs almost 2 sizes too large.

* **ASOS** Carries a petite line.

* **Banana Republic** Sized for taller women. Carries small sizes (starting at 00/xxs),

* **Charlotte Russe** Inexpensive jeans that are good for pear shapes. Not too long and good rise length and fit both waist and legs. 

* **Express** Good quality jeans. Look for coupons or deals before you buy. Dress shirts and bottoms run large.

* **Forever 21** Extremely uneven in terms of sizing and quality (poorly sewn buttons

* **Gap** carries small sizes (starting at 0/xs), frequent online sales

* **JCrew** Tops are true to size but bottoms run large. Their [sizing chart](http://www.jcrew.com/sizecharts/main.jsp?sizeChart=1, carries large sizes (up to 20), carries a petite and tall line

* **H&amp;M** Runs small in the bust. They have good stretch basics for cheap

* **Levi's** Good for curvy girls

* **Loft** Runs very large. Carries small sizes (starting at 00/xxs)

* **Mara Hoffman** Runs small

* **Mexx** Decent quality

* **Mod Cloth** [Age 35 and under] Overpriced for the quality. Similar or same pieces can be found at [LuLu's](http://www.lulus.com)

* **New York and Company** Good quality work separates.

* **Pac Sun** Poor quality. Clothes that are from a 'name' brand

* **Paige** Good for women with long legs and slim hips. Conservative detailing (grommets

* **Seven** Good for less curvy girls. 

* **TopShop** Overpriced for the quality. Similar or same pieces can be found at H&amp;M

* **Uniqlo** Good quality for the price. Runs small. (Uniqlo 6 is equivalent to a 0-2). Good for long waisted ladies.

* **Urban Outfitters** Quality is uneven so be careful. 'Kimchi Blue' label seems to hold up better than others. online reviews are extremely helpful in determining item fit/quality

* **Zara** Sizing is extremely variable (a person could fit comfortably into M and not be able to wear an XL in another item),False,self,t5_2s8o5,True,,,t3_pl6px

1365980299.0,1ccpgo,Thrift Shopping Guide &amp; Discussion,counttess,115,20,41,"###Counttess' Guide to Thrift Shopping

[In response to my post about clothes I got thrifting](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ca8p6/ive_been_on_a_thrift_store_run_for_the_past/)

##Before walking out the door:
---
Have a general style in mind. Have an inspo album

[For fun


## Picking out thrift stores:
---
1.	Maybe this should go without being said

2.	**Make sure your ideals match the thrift store’s ideals too.** Don’t inadvertently support something that you don’t actually support! 

3.	**Consignment and buy back stores are your friends, you can sell your old stuff there and get store credit. By buy back stores, I mean places like Plato’s Closet and Uptown Cheapskate.

##Clothing:
---
1.	**Before anything else, but it’s a nice guide to have. *Edit: This is primarily for people who are new to thrift shopping. After a while, you'll get the hang of what feels quality regardless of brand. I have certainly purchased Target, Gap, etc. brand names. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of these items have had a previous life, so you're getting it the second time around. You want to make it work for you as long as possible. I would also think of this as a ""brand quality minimum"" as in I won't usually go below the quality of an average J.Crew or BR piece.*
2.	**If you don’t know the brand
3.	**Stick with that inspo album we talked about.** 
4.	**Have some overarching goals in mind.** For example, I specifically picked out brown leather and pulled it out. 
5.	**Stained
6.	**Too big but awesome? Get it tailored.** Still so much cheaper.
7.	**Pre-tailored items:** Occasionally you’ll find items that are pre-tailored, etc.
8.	**Don’t buy:** Things that only fit. If they don’t fit your style

##Shoes:
---
1.	**Again
2.	**If they hurt or doesn’t fit
3.	**Watch for wear!!** Again, visible threading (unless that's the style obviously).
4.	**Try on BOTH shoes in the pair.** It’s really easy to try on one shoe and assume the other will be fine (because that’s what you do when buying new shoes) but I’ve discovered boots with one broken zipper or heels with the tip missing.

##Bags:

---
A little bit easier, go for your style!

##Generic tips:
---
1.	**Your smartphone is your friend.** Use it to look up brands that you’re not sure about but seem like their quality. 
2.	~~**Take pictures of what you try on in the mirror.** Your perception of it in the mirror is one thing
3.	**Don’t be discouraged!!** Be comfortable with yourself, and you know what? That’s fine. It’s the clothing, not me, that’s wrong.


##A shopping trip at the thrift store for me:
---
*AKA: Why sticking with the above guidelines are important*

I start with the shoes, so this is really a quick glance section for me. Now, I get started on the tops. I stick with my inspo album on this, and usually skip red/yellow/orange entirely, do a cursory glance over green &amp; blue (usually if I see a fabric I like sticking out), then really hone in on the prints and neutral colors. I also don’t like wearing dark colors on top, so I skip over dark browns and blacks. I do the same thing with dresses, and pants. I already have the perfect black dress and a couple pairs of black slacks

##A lot of this seems obvious!

Great! You're probably already a fashionista. Remember, etc.

###Biggest thing to take away: If something *doesn't* look good on you when it's $100

Pleeease ask me any questions

I've embedded helpful(?) photos throughout the post.

**Height**: 5'6
**Weight**: 190
**Age**: 25

**Body type**: I struggled somewhat with this

**My measurements are as follows**:
Bust: 42.5""
Band: 36""
Waist: 33""--I measured at the ""thinnest"" part of me
Hip: 43""
Upper thigh area: 46""

**Why? Why are you looking to dress better?** I've always lacked confidence when it came to choosing clothing, and never anything nicer. [I recently lost 70 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/J374z), and would love to update my wardrobe with clothing that is stylish and fashionable (and affordable.) Up until a few months ago, I was STILL wearing clothing from when I was 70 lbs heavier... That awful pink shirt from the first ""before"" picture? I was still wearing it--a 2X on a L frame. Now, I have about 5 shirts, all from Kohls, that I wear very often, and it's the only type of pants I own. So awful. PLEASE help me.

**You now**: [Here are some photos of my commonly-worn outfits](http://imgur.com/a/3wGC6). And when I say commonly-worn, all from Kohls, and all of which are embellished with sequins or beading around the neckline, etc. The shoes I wear are are either those white sandals, or a simple pair of black flats. I don't ever really wear skirts or dresses. I am not a fan of my legs, which are chunky, and I'm not sure what length of skirt would be appropriate for me. I never really have an occasion for wearing a dress, though! Please don't take this to mean that I'm not open to dresses/heels

**You after**: I would like to look modern and put-together. I'm not sure how to describe what style I'm aiming for, I haven't particularly liked ""standing out"" but I am hoping to change that. 

**Budget**: I don't necessarily have a budget, unless it's a special occasion or something like a nice jacket. I haven't set out thinking about how much I'll be buying, but I am not the wealthiest individual (did the fact that I only own 5 tops tip you off to that?). However, I do have a good chunk of disposable income that I can pour into this effort. 

**Haircut**: I would love suggestions on a hairstyle, with a little bit of layering for volume. I have NEVER strayed from this.... but I'd like to try! [Here's a picture of my face](http://i.imgur.com/kqyKj.jpg)... please excuse the lack of makeup and gross morning face. I am willing to spend up to 15 minutes a day on my hair, I suppose.

As the title indicates, and many missing female brands. I gave up on finding some pronunciations, and I'm sure there are better examples out there for others. Feel free to give me feedback, and I'd be happy to enhance the list. If there's great demand, I might include some IPA pronunciation illustrations, but for many of the names this would be quite unexact so for now I've left it out.

Cheers

    - Nick

Note: The original pronunciation isn't always the best pronunciation for your area or dialect. Let's be honest--forcing a fake French accent will do little more than make you look pedantic (or worse,[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1376242541.0,guide,True

The idea is to have a weekly thread (similar to how FFA post WAYWT) but it would have a theme that would challenge us to experiment with our wardrobe and explore the limits of our style. The themes could be regarding a situation (like casual outfit for a day at a fair or beach outfits, waist belts, [$20 outfits](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/vg0iu/20_outfits/)), or can be to challenge a common fashion ""rule"" (like wearing black and brown or black and navy together). I don't like the idea of a contest but maybe just posting outfits in the thread to get feedback and to use as inspiration. 

I think the most beneficial part of these threads is that there will be a collection of outfits that fit with a common theme and could easily answer a lot of common questions. This way, or how to wear polka dots, etc, they can search the thread and see a wide variety of outfits. I would be happy to take this up or hand it over to a mod.

About Me:

* **Height**: 5'3""
* **Age:** 25
* **Measurements:** 35"" x 25.75"" x 36"" (bust
* **Body Type:** Pretty solidly hourglass
* **Why?:** I want to look more put together, so I'm drawn to classic looks but because of that I want to avoid preppy, boring, sorority-girl, matchy-matchy and so on. Classic but with a bit of an edge. Ladylike but not Modcloth ""quirky."" To give you an idea of my personal style safe zone, see [this pinboard](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/my-style/). I really love Audrey Hepburn (not just Holly Golightly), but my go-to street style fav on any given day is Alexa Chung. Charlotte Gainsbourg, too). Brands I love are Kate Spade, see [this board](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A9-i-wanna-get-a-new-look/). **If I could boil down into a few words what I'm shooting for, classic
* **You Now:** My current style waffles between boring and sloppy. I want to look classic, Madewell and Uniqlo. Before that I was all H&amp;M, F21 and *delias, so my style is evolving. I'm at a point where I'm okay investing more in my clothes. I am girly and don't dislike skirts, high heels or pretty much any article of clothing, but I tend not to wear dresses and skirts to work since most people are super casual in jeans (most people where graphic tees and jeans -- my boss wears crocs every day!). I am not into the hyper-trendy, though, but I usually try to dress up a little because I enjoy it.
* **Budget:** Low to mid-range. The highest I'm willing to go for a single article of clothing is maybe $40-$80, tending to invest a little bit in a few items in the middle range or going on a shopping binge for trends to try at at a low-end retailer like H&amp;M or F21. At the moment I'm trying to edit my warddrobe way down and only go for the essentials.
* **Location:** US, I do travel for work a fair amount and do need clothes for that occasionally, too.

Happy to answer any more questions or post more pictures if needed

ETA: Guys

1. The hideous (but comfortable) American Eagle booties are officially retired. They'll be replaced by an ankle boot with a slimmer fit up top. It's clear the look I thought I was doing with those is not coming off as intended or working.
2. Sorry about the ugly sneakers in a couple of the outfits. I work about 5-6 work events a year so I'm torn on whether or not to even bother with dressing up for those things.
3. Oh my god FIT!! I had no idea that the fit of my clothes was even a problem
4. Jeans! Ugh. I'll keep looking for better fitting jeans that don't sag in the knee.

The first part of the article talks about a minimalist approach to your wardrobe and what that means. To quote
&gt;... it is about embracing the minimalist concept of having less but making sure that everything you do have fits your aesthetic taste and lifestyle perfectly.

While I agree with this for the most part, the time you take to seek it out, etc) in your pieces. If you're interested in this idea, here are two articles I love:

1. [The Life Cycle of Gear and Its Impact on Our Lives](http://hackmake.org/2013/07/the-life-cycle-of-gear-and-its-impact-on-our-lives) 
1. [Active Ownership vs. Minimalism](http://hackmake.org/2012/02/active-ownership-vs-minimalism).

Now

The second part talks about essentially purging your wardrobe. I don't agree with all the different steps and having different piles for different feelings (throw away, maybe sell, etc). I believe in the hard fast rule ""Did I wear this last season? ""No? Donate it."" and it's over. However, I'll assume most people have a much harder time getting rid of their pieces. I suspect this is a trend in someone's overall life and not just with clothing. For this, I'd recommend taking all those pieces you're unsure about, boxing them up, stuffing them in your basement and in a year go back down there. If you haven't been down there within the year

The next couple parts talking about defining your style, which is why **we buy pieces, not outfits.** Buying pieces allows you to mix and match, buying outfits confines you to that one style. I've started to use pinterest to help me build out, visually, what it is I want to represent.

So, but I don't know if I go for this define a number thing. I rather buy the least amount of *stuff* that I need to create a great wardrobe and not have to worry if I went over the hard fast number of how many pieces I'm allowed in my wardrobe for it to qualify as a capsule/french wardrobe.

You can also use Google. If you're looking to identify a specific article of clothing, fabric, pattern, etc., of the article in question (if that fails, remember to use /r/findfashion). 

If you're looking for a general article (i.e., try [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/) - they have an impressive range of search attributes to help you find shoes, even for the difficult-to-fit customer (wide or narrow calfs, short or long legs, wide or narrow feet).

AND MAY THE R/FFA GOD(DESSES) HAVE MERCY ON MY NAIVE SOUL

Okay

I just turned 18 earlier this month

Basically, and settle for either the same skirt or pair of black leggings, and one of like 5 pullover sweaters. Cardigan? Blazer? Boots? Non-black tights? I don't own any of those.

And I want to. But it's scary and overwhelming to jump in and I already get ridiculed for it (both jokingly and non-jokingly) by my friends for ""not wearing pants"" and wearing the same thing over and over again. (i'm kinda poor, but I am a much happier person if I feel like I look fabulous, and that's something everyone should feel all the time (except when shark week rolls in).

But now that I've got a little bit of cash (from working), say, cardigan and dress sa-yu-ri or in general more sophisticated-looking. 
Like, but again, I'm an adult now and I'm pretty sure I can't get away with too many Hello Kitty-esque articles of clothing. 

Okay

1. I own a pair of jeggings that I bought from AE on sale
2. Back to the AE jeggings. The ones I bought are size 0 regular, almost covering my feet, it was fucking absurd). I suspect that I stretched the hell out of them, but another pair did the same thing. I find it unlikely that both pairs were stretched out that much. But the 0 REGULAR were just the perfect length. How is this possible? (Is there fashion jargon for this that explains it?)
3. Except for the jeggings, but I've burned through most of my creative combinations (and I have some *good* ones) and it's too cold to wear most of my dresses. Did I mention that I live just northwest of Boston? And I walk 1.5 miles, uphill, both ways, through a Nor'easter to get to school every day? (I actually only walk one way, but you get it.) My goal is to not freeze my ass off for approximately six months, but I can't bear to wear leggings anymore every day or jeans/jeggings every day. Please help. Is it bad to wear tights of varying colors every day for six months?
4. ...but I sweat a lot. It's gross. I admit it. But walking home from school is especially bad, plus it's Boston), so this isn't going to change. Until I figure something out, i've sworn off flats. They're cute, but even a few days of wears and it seems that i've doomed them to all hell. What am I doing wrong? Also, stains on shirts: do they come out?

5. Hey, but what are some boots that you ladies love? Please keep in mind that I'm a (soon-to-be) poor college student who is fashiontarded and a size 6.5. I know that I should try to invest in quality things that last longer, but since I'm still trying to figure out my style, I don't want to waste too much money.
6. Where do y'all get essentials
7. I'm almost done, but I like F21. I know they're ""fast fashion"" and I'm not really into that, but I love their Love21/Essentials line. It's more down-to-earth and they have things like simple cardigans. Is that a good place to start for cardigans and blazers and whatnot?
8. I've looked everywhere and I can't find bandeaus. Seriously
9. Besides flats, and evening shoes, what footwear must every female own?

Also, it's what randomly popped into my head while I was casually browsing. It's very me-ish.

Okay, just to feel like I'm not an ugly duckling that dresses like an elementary schooler. It's not as cute as it was 3 years ago, even though I could pass for 15 very easily.

I'll see if I can get pictures of myself wearing some of my favorite things

The iconic style, wheat color, and even the same SKU (10061, in case you were wondering).  The company markets itself as being socially and environmentally responsible, and is known for sponsoring service trips and programs such as City Year.

While Tims were and still are primarily work boots

She will be getting married at the **circus**, which is mostly royal blue with some black and white. My brother and soon-to-be stepbrother will be wearing black dress slacks and probably royal blue dress shirts. 



**Background information:**
My mom is ~48, is very frugal, doesn't ever do nice things for herself (too busy doing them for everyone else). I really want to help her find a dress that she can look and feel fabulous in. And we need to find it quickly. I'm thinking $200 budget, but could be persuaded to go a bit higher for the right dress. 



**The dress should be:** 

* flattering to her pear shaped figure

* Full length

* Bright! Royal blue

* From a reputable online retailer that can ship quickly *or* from one of the following B&amp;M stores: Macy's, Sears, Express(though I'm guessing nothing age appropriate there), J Crew (probably not fancy/flashy enough), Cache.

1342839900.0,wwoww,Basics for the Young Professional,gossipsquirrel,96,21,37,"Yes

1. I'm 19 years old, where it is jeans casual and super relaxed. However, during the school year, I do consulting where most of our clients are Fortune 500 and business professional to business casual is required.

2. I'm 5'2, meaning that my hips and legs are where my fat is stored, but I'm relatively slim elsewhere. Forgive me if this seems as though it's focused on one body type-- I've tried to include examples of others as well!

3. Budget&amp;Style wise, Nordstrom Rack a lot. But whenever I buy anything from these shops, I am thorough with checking the construction of the garment, as well as the material it is made out of before buying it. I'm a college student, so everything is budget constrained.

I'll try and go through all the basics a young professional should own.

*Let me also say one important thing: before you go out and shop
___________________________________________



&gt;**Business Professional
**

**Jacket**

I find myself in a suit often, if you wanted to wear it for other occasions. I also looked for a good weight to the fabric. As a pear shape, I also make sure my jacket ends before the widest part of my hips start. Otherwise, I find that my hips are emphasized and I look fat.

I also make sure that the fit is right, toward your arm, not your neck. It should not lay on or inside, otherwise it won't fit right. I'm not sure if everyone has this bump on their shoulder, but I just checked my sister and she does.

[This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/56/32/5632b7a9368adf74eefda09f7bbc8201_best.jpg) is the exact suit jacket that I have from [Express](http://goo.gl/QHBA5) in black. I button it when I'm standing

For more well endowed girls, is that the lapels might be a little bit too wide. Look for a jacket with narrow ones, as well as ones WITHOUT pockets on the top half. Simple pockets for the bottom half are okay. *--Thanks Jamanduh!*


**Trousers**

I have two pairs of trousers that I wear

When trying these on, since my hips are bigger than my waist, so I'd advise going to a tailor to get anything fixed. As for the length, this wholly depends on whether you prefer to wear flats or heels to work. Regardless, your pants should not be long enough where you'd start to step on them. They should not touch the ground, or be close to touching the ground. They also should [not drape](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/nruboc/nruboc0611/nruboc061100010/603454-a-woman-carrying-an-umbrella-going-to-work.jpg) over the top of your shoe, because you want clean lines. Refer to the picture of the pants above.

Whenever I go out to buy trousers and try them on


**Skirt**

For hot days, when shopping, I look for fabric weight and content. For skirts, I check to see if it is lined, just due to personal preference of not wearing slips. The skirt I have is high waisted, but again, this is due to personal preference.

Fit-wise, then the skirt is too small for you. A pencil skirt should also not hug your legs. It should hug your hips and slightly hug your butt. If it hugs your legs as well, then it's a bandage skirt, not a pencil skirt, and is inappropriate for work. The fabric should hang from your butt.

My skirt ends at the top of my knees. When I sit down, or be a dark grey or a dark brown. It could be high waisted or not. What matters is that it fits and flatters.

[This](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=9191912) is a skirt similar to the one I have

Not like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dq4uLVj7DxU/Tp3q9tCaZSI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/B96HuP3cwh8/s640/GG-8.jpg). The weight of this fabric is much too thin

Or like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TLVNCNyjZcI/AAAAAAAAAH0/sNHKFzA_KAE/s1600/pencil-skirt.jpg). This skirt is too tight and the fabric is puckering.


**Shirt or Blouse**

I say shirt or blouse here because some people cannot wear button up shirts without getting them tailored. It just makes sense financially then

The classic white shirt is button up and made out of a high quality cotton with a decent weight to it. Ideally, it does not satisfy these requirements, you either must get it tailored, or not buy it at all.

This is when you should wear a blouse underneath your suit coat. This obviously can vary widely and is up to your personal tastes. It helps to pick something in white, you can wear pretty much any blouse, as long as it fits, is modest, and is flattering. Cleavage should not be shown. I like details on my blouse to be part of its construction, and not in the pattern of the fabric. Personally, I think patterns aren't business professional.

[This](http://resources.shopstyle.com/sim/76/18/76187294483213072c30266166cd2604/express-tees-lace-yoke-ruffle-sleeve-easy-tee.jpg) from [Express](http://goo.gl/ZBYlp) is appropriate under a coat, [this](http://goo.gl/Y28qb), [this](http://goo.gl/iEgnM), or [this.](http://goo.gl/ZIYJa)

Basically, flatters, and is appropriate**.

**Shoes**

Close toed shoes are business professional, I was taught that they weren't appropriate for business professional. Shoes should be in a solid color with minimal hardware. Flats or heels, just make sure you can walk comfortably in them. Nothing is more unprofessional than hobbling around on heels that you clearly haven't learned to wear. If you do decide to wear heels, there is a line to be drawn for what is appropriate and what isn't. Obviously, 6 inch platform heels are not appropriate for the workplace. My rule for shoes is this: if I bought it with the idea of going to a party/club in mind, then I shouldn't wear it to work.

I have [this pair](http://a2.zassets.com/images/z/1/3/0/4/1/3/1304139-p-MULTIVIEW.jpg) of low wedges from [Cole Haan](http://goo.gl/4vlw3). Honestly, but I've also heard good things from their line of Nike Air bed shoes. If your suit is black, so should your shoes be. If your suit is brown, brown shoes.

I've noticed in a lot of threads recently (and not-so-recently) that FFA is really interested in raw denim. So I thought it'd be fun for us to have an FFA-wide raw denim fit discussion/purchase decision making/fade tracking/care thoughts/etc. There are some FFAers who have already purchased raws

##What is raw denim

I'm going to give you the explanation as I understand it: denim that has not been washed after it has been dyed/finished. You can check out /r/rawdenim for a better explanation if you want.

Raw denim is typically purchased for the ""sick fadez"" - this is where the whiskering and wear is *desired*

Also, or that washed denim is poor quality.

##What brands are there for me to buy?

Many raw denim manufacturers only produce cuts for men. This can be a hassle, so the cuts may not be flattering or may simply just not fit well. Here are some brands (most taken from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1h2u1o/raws_for_girls/) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1jlzm9/female_looking_for_first_pair/)) that produce women's cuts (not comprehensive!):

## That's great

Well, I like trying jeans on first. However, depending on where you are in the world, it can be pretty difficult finding a place where you can try them on. I suggest looking at the brands and figuring out which one you like first, then trying to find a local retailer.

## Didn't you say this was going to be a discussion post?

Yep. Soooo. Discuss! Ask questions, so there'll be tons of questions that I don't know the answer to - so hopefully more knowledgeable people can jump in.

## Didn't you also say that we'd track fades together?

Yes I did! I'll be posting monthly threads that will be shorter asking everyone to post a picture of how their raws are going and how they've been treating them! If you are early/late to the party

* To go along with buying online

* Craigslist: also on the difficult side

* On the petite side? Try looking in the children's department. More likely than not you'll find something that fits. 

* DIY: Learn how to sew

* Never buy retail. I usually buy things in this order: Goodwill/thrift, generally).

* Go to thrift stores in wealthier areas. They probably get better donations. On that note

* Buying something online? Search for a coupon code first.

* Try not to overwash clothing. Consider what the article's been exposed to

* Drip-dry clothing. It'll reduce wear and tear on the fibers.

* Pay attention to care instructions on the tag. 

* KEEP THE TAGS ON EVERYTHING until you've worn it

* Iron/hang clothing that would benefit from it.

**Height**: 5ft 10 (and a half!) or 179cm


**Age**: 34


**Measurements**: 
Bust: 32F (definitely accurate – I love my lingerie)
Waist: 30
Hips: 44
Inside leg: 33


**Body Type**: Pear


**Why?**: 

When I was younger I was a bit of a tomboy and lived in jeans, none of which were attractive on me but did the job.

Over the years, grey work pants, brown work pants, black work pants, cardigans of many colours) but I feel like I’m made up of blocks of colour.  I think I’m missing the part that makes it ‘mine.’  

So I’m looking to find my style

I also feel like I’m at that dangerous age where certain clothing is making me look ‘motherly.’  X_X  I do not want to look motherly.  I might be getting older and I know I can’t really pull off ‘cute’ like I used to but I would like to feel sophisticated and attractive.  



**You Now:**

I’ve been watching [polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/browse.likes?page=1&amp;uid=5253046) and pinterest for some time

Dark reds, any bold colour.  Pastels don’t suit me at all.

Wedges are comfortable.  Super high heels will destroy me but I like the way a heel looks and want to wear more.  I would love a nice red heeled shoe but I can’t seem to find one that doesn’t scream ‘prostitute!’ at me.  (Maybe I’m too conservative?)  I think I need a push to try bolder patterns because I feel conspicuous when I wear them even if I love how they look.



**Features:**  I have a nice collarbone and neck.  My boobs are still adequately defying gravity and I can manage a low cut top if necessary.  I hate my knees. They are fat.



**Budget**: An initial spend of around 500 to 600 euros.  Thereafter I can afford up to 200 euros monthly


**Location**: Netherlands (with regular trips to the UK


**Plan:**  

I made a plan, accessories, scarves.  I have no scarves.

Which leads me to shoes....  Just how many pairs of shoes is it acceptable for a girl to have because I reckon I need about 8 more pairs just to finish off the outfits I already have!  But

1. Is this problem unique to women's shoes or are men's shoes equally uncomfortable? 

2. Is expecting shoes to be comfortable a relatively recent phenomenon or is the lack of cute and comfortable shoes a symptom/result of the quantity over quality/fast fashion culture taking over?

3. Is it just that the market for comfortable shoes is bigger than the market for fashionable ones/people will still buy cute shoes if they aren't comfortable? Are luxury designer shoes comfortable? I've heard Louboutins aren't comfortable

4. Do you think that there's any chance that women's shoes are uncomfortable because there's an expectation that women should sacrifice comfort for fashion?

5. Do you think that maybe I just have crazy high arches or weird feet and women's shoes really ARE just fine the way they are?

1352332543.0,12tsqg,Starter Guide: A Minimalist Scandinavian Professional Wardrobe,,102,25,26,"Introduction 
===

Recently I've been spending a good deal of time thinking about what the ""ideal""
wardrobe for a modern careerwoman entering the workplace would look like
this evening I broke out my list of bookmarks and went to it![^1]

My inspirations were [Theysekns' Theory
AW12](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2012/ready-to-wear/theyskens-theory)
meets [Céline
AW11](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2011/ready-to-wear/celine/)
with a dash of Scandinavian Functionalism thrown in for good measure - a
wardrobe characterised by sharp
nigh void of ornamentation, camel, and
khaki offset by pops of colour in knits and accessories. On the weekends and
evenings a slightly edgier aesthetic marked by more directional cuts
playful accessories
fore to create an informal wardrobe with all the intellectual trappings of its
professional sister. 

First Principles 
===

The goal here is to have a solid set of starter items that will let you
make it through a week or two without wearing the same thing twice
to worry about your work and all the fun opportunities having a job quite
literally affords you
a creative industry where you spend the majority of your time in a non-client
facing capacity but occasionally require more upscale attire for meetings and
conferences; lawyers
more constrained attire than what is featured.

* **Budget**: I aim to keep it at roughly €2.000/£2, the idea being it is
  enough to allow for higher quality items that will last several years before
  replacement
  months of starting work. 

* **Versatility**: Minimalism entails garments have at least a modicum of
  flexibility in how they are styled and worn. When you only have a few items of
  each type there's no use in only being able to pair them with one or two other
  pieces. 

* **Fit**: Essential. Nothing makes clothing look worse than obviously being
  the wrong size! Don't be afraid to be hypercritical in the dressing room
  also know what can be cheaply tailored or sewn at home - for the price of a
  lunch at a streetside café a €50 pair of trousers can be made to look like
  €500 ones. 


Work
===

Starting your career is a daunting prospect and knowing you are ready to
blow your coworkers away with style is an excellent confidence-booster. I have
divided the wardrobe into categories with key considerations when shopping
bulleted
climates and cultures other than the cold

##Outerwear
Coats and jackets to shield you from the elements and look great while doing it.

* Jackets are often the most striking piece in an ensemble; their status as the
  outermost garment makes it the first item in an outfit to be noticed. 

* Ensure whatever you buy flatters your figure
  What looks best on a towering 1.75m Scandinavian and a 1.5m Asian petite is
  very different.

* Note the composition and get a feel for the fabric if possible. A polyester
  lining is fine

* [COS Cashmere and Wool
  Coat](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Coats_Jackets/Cashmere_and_wool_coat/46891-1369320.1#c-3227499):
  Ideal for the taller woman
  striking silhouette
  €190

* [COS A-Line Wool
  Coat](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Coats_Jackets/A-line_wool_coat/46891-2655558.1#c-4201041):
  For the shorter set

* [COS Straight Grey
  Coat](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Coats_Jackets/Straight_grey_coat/46891-1360015.1#c-2833637):
  For those not so enamored with black or in a climate that doesn't call for
  such a heavy jacket

##Tailoring (Jackets and Blazers)
Tailored jackets and blazers in wool and cotton will be a day-to-day essential.
Heartier fabrics such as wool are generally reserved for the cooler months
while cotton and jersey will keep you cool (and looking great) through Spring
and Summer.

* If it doesn't fit in the shoulders
  this is next to impossible and virtually always more expensive than getting a
  fitting piece in the first place.

* Even if you have a habit of wearing tailored jackets open
  doesn't pull or wrinkle when buttoned
  generous to your bosom. 

* If an OtR jacket features surgeon cuffs and the sleeves aren't the correct
  length it's going to be hard to fix. Abstain.

* [Weekday Flores Cropped Black
  Blazer](http://www.weekday.com/womens-wear/mtwtfss-collection/all/jackets/flores-blazer):
  This little black thing would pair excellently with high-waisted trousers for

  as to be unprofessional. Doubles as outerwear for early autumn - €99 


##Shirting/Blouses
You'll want a few nice button-front shirts for more formal days or want to feel
particularly smart. Between regular tops and blouses you want at least 8-10
shirts; generally you can get away with wearing a proper shirt more than once
before washing.  To fit with the modern look
plackets

* Buy for the chest and shoulders
  is easy

* 7/8th sleeves should be intentional

  structured alternative to the COS Slim fit - €100

  €50

* [Zara Studio Shirt with Removable

  fine. You should be able to find these cheaply with some prudent sale
  shopping.

##Knitwear
Finally
variety to your attire via layering. 

---

* [Zara Backzip Striped
  Sweater](http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/fr/en/zara-W2012/269190/870528/STRIPED%20SWEATER%20WITH%20BACK%20ZIP):

  Similar to the flared top
  especially if in the same colourway - €49

* Generic Knits: Having a few grey and cream jumpers in your preferred neckline
  is a way to expand.

##Tailoring (Pants)
Dresses and skirting are so passé[^womenswear]. Tailored trousers are the new
frontier. Experimenting with different lengths
works best for you is important

* Nice fabric; does the wool feel cheap and scratchy? Is it already pilling in
  the store? Is it holding a crease?

* Look for fully lined trousers for winter warmth. Lighter fabrics like poplin
  and linen can serve in even the hottest climates.

* If tucking in a shirt a higher rise is imperative

---

  Trousers](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Trousers/Trousers_with_back_zip/46887-940984.1#c-5037219):
  For those day sans blazer
  look - €69


##Denim
The best denim fit varies so much from person to person that my recommendation
is to head down to the nearest metro area and try on as much as you can. A
skinny or cigarette fit is flattering to a wide range of body types. One pair of
indigo and one in black should be enough for a basic wardrobe. Try not to spend
more than €70-80[^rawdenim] on anything with elastene or spandex. 

##Footwear
In footwear you are looking for something that continues the line of the leg and
elongates your silhouette. It's a bit difficult to find lower-priced
alternatives here
higher-priced

* A black, and
  almond toe. Round is very juvenile

* A flat Chelsea boot or Sidezip

* A heeled bootie 

* An Oxford

* Trainers: A nice minimal trainer is great - if you're not trail running it can
  even do double duty as an exercise shoe.

1351131995.0,121lhc,On Improving your Fashion Photography,,84,10,17,"I know many of you have cameras sitting around and you're using them on automatic and frankly

**1) Get someone else to take the picture!** It's less stressful. Seriously. I hate messing around with remotes, but when you half press the shutter. These remotes allow you to remotely half press the shutter, allowing for a picture that has perfect focus. But more on focus later.

**2) Posing:** I'm nowhere near a model

**3) Lighting:** Get outside! The best light is natural light, flash is distracting and not very flattering unless you have an external flash and properly sync it/use a diffuser.

**4) Wide open aperture**: The smaller the aperture number, [two](http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs29/i/2008/109/8/1/Depth_of_Field_Tutorial_1_by_killrb323.jpg), [three](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-48jvzTzN-qc/TrqompMmDtI/AAAAAAAAA1I/yUWpeIFnhGo/s1600/dof.jpg). Generally, a wide open aperture will have two results: a pretty soft focus background (also known as bokeh/shallow depth of field) but a bitch of a time to focus. Depending on what kind of camera you have, here's an easy way to go about it:

* Point and shoot: Simple cameras

* DSLR: Digital Single Lens Reflex. The bigger cameras with the removable lens. Most DSLR's come with a lens. It's usually an 18-55mm f 3.5 - 5.6 kit lens. The f 3.5 is usually not wide enough to result in super blurry backgrounds, if your budget allows, to pick up an f 1.8 lens. If you haven an entry level DSLR, you'll unfortunately need a lens with a motor. They run for about 200 dollars, but they'll be the best investment ever. I never take my f 1.8 off my lens. The f 1.4 is even better, hell the f 1.2, 85mm on a crop is one of the greatest portait lenses ever IMO.

I suggest working your way up from the following modes until you get used to working absolutely everything on manual.

* Simple mode: Set your camera to Aperture priority (A on a Nikon)

* Slightly harder mode: Set your camera to Aperture priority, set your aperture to f 1.8, set your focus to spot metering at your focus style to AF-S, and use your trackpad to manually select your focus point (for portraits, aim on faces).

* Hard mode: Set your camera to Manual, set your aperture to f 1.8, set your focus to spot metering at your focus style to AF-S, and use your trackpad to manually select your focus point (for portraits, aim on faces) and you will need to custom pick your shutter speed. Usually, your camera has a meter built in when you look through the viewfinder. Try and get that meter in the centre to properly expose your picture.

* Super Hard Self-Portrait Mode: If using a self timer and a tripod (i.e. you have no control over focus except trial and error, but for a precise but time consuming method I occasionally do for self portraits:

1) Frame the shot

2) Set down an object as to where you want to take the picture from

3) Stand exactly where the object is

4) Put down a different object where the tripod was

5) Fix up all your settings (namely: metering, ISO)

6) Set your camera to self timer

7) Stand exactly where you put the second object

8) Voila!


**5) Location**: To extend the illusion of an even shallower depth of field, try and find a location where you can see as far as possible.

This is an interview for a marketing position. The company is very laid back

**Important downside**: I'm going to be wearing this over an hour on the metro, which doesn't seem to coincide with pretty very often. It did mean I was relieved when she offered me the option to show up in anything accept my usual interview suit.

- Age: 28
- Body type: slight hourglass
- Hair: useless. It's down to mid-back, very fine, but thick - usually lays down and plays dead.
- Skin: so pale that I was teased for being ""light green"" in high school.

**Background/horror story**: The last time I had a potential employer tell me that their environment was ""very casual, and all the women there were in fashionable dresses, stockings, full hair/makeup, no heels lower than 4"", and no one was larger than a size 2. They were all fresh-out-of-college, stab-you-in-the-face, sell-or-die recent business grads working in straight-up competitive sales. I was interviewed by a kid who must have been barely 21 who was wearing a full 3-piece bespoke suit (silk vest

In hindsight

**Me now**: On days off, it's usually:

- charcoal grey slacks
- [black shoes kind of like this](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;tid=34971619)
- a button up shirt (usually solid purple or maroon)
- if it's cold
- and a black, but I have to carry samples of my work on my laptop, and I've never found a pretty way to do that.)

**Budget**: Looking mostly for general suggestions, shirts, and I even have a fun blue and green hipster scarf. Mostly I'm looking for what pieces to slot together to dress up without making the interviewer uncomfortable.

It's difficult to really imagine the number of people killed here.  To put it in some kind of perspective:  377 is more people than were in my high school graduating class.  In fact

It's perhaps a little too easy to dismiss these incidents as being ""tragic

I'd like to have a realistic conversation on ethics and social responsibility in this context.  Justifications for the textile industry range from ethically or socially sensitive (the industry helps people) to neutral (it's not my country/problem) to selfish (I want cheap clothes).  Some of the most common defenses of the textile industry include:

* **Workers want those jobs**.  The workers would not choose those jobs if they didn't want to be there.

* **Even shitty jobs empower women**.  Textile workers are overwhelmingly young women who have few other options available.

* **It's not the consumer's job to enforce human rights**. Governments are responsible for protecting their own citizens.

* **We need to address problems at home before problems abroad**.  This assumes that we are only capable of dedicating mental and physical resources to one pursuit at a time.  (Kind of like the ""why help women when minorities suffer too???"" argument in men's rights.)

* **The industry is helping developing economies**.  The textile industry is often a huge percentage of GDP in developing nations; China exports ~$120 billion of textiles per year

* **The market has to work itself out**.  Market forces operate best without interference.  If consumers wanted to push for ethical manufacturing

* **Ethical standards vary**.  It's not fair to hold Bangladesh to the same labor standards as Canada because their people are used to different standards.  (As if the right not to die in a factory collapse is merely a *cultural difference*.)

* **Ethics are all-or-nothing**:  If you want to buy clothes ethically

* **People can't afford more expensive clothing**.  Not much to justify this one

* **

Some questions to consider:

* How legitimate are these arguments?

* How ethical are these arguments?

* Do you believe in collective social responsibility for human rights?

* How analogous is the contemporary textile industry to the Industrial Revolution in North America and Europe?  Can we expect a similar timeline and similar results?

* With growth far outpacing basic infrastructure

* What will be the long-term environmental effects of the textile industry?

* What can we do differently?

* **

I do not know if I am in the correct subreddit, just ridiculously comfortable.

So please help me where the rest of the internet seems to point guys towards sexy sleep clothing. What is the best/most comfortable nightie you can buy? Any specific material or brand? 

Thank you for the help!

**The problem:** Trying on clothes is really frustrating because nothing seems to fit well. I don't think that my body is *that* oddly shaped, if we can get that far. I currently have a pair of Vans that I wear with everything.)

Style: I don't have much of one. Currently, but I would like to look decent and hop out of my t-shirt phase. I don't know the names of many specific styles, but I'd like to see myself in the layered, flowy things. You know, what you see a ton of on college campuses. 

Budget: I'm a frugal college kid. I can't imagine spending more than $20 on a shirt, Forever 21, and thrift stores.

As part of the moderator's efforts to broaden the scope of the FFA Community and encourage diversification of the subreddit we're making an attempt to expand the sidebar and bring it more in-line with the quantity of information offered by our male subreddit-in-arms, and women tend to be more educated than men when it comes to knowing how items should fit, patterns should match, etc.

With that said

Finding a Style
---
___
Once you understand the basic elements of style - the central tenets of fit, [tried](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/1-Prep1.jpg)-and-[true](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/1-Prep2.png) preppy aesthetic or end up on the [cutting](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/2-CuttingEdge1.jpg)-[edge](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/2-CuttingEdge2.jpg) hopefully this guide will help you discover what makes you happy.

Fortunately

While they can't compete with the quantity of information available on the internet, or delving into fashion theory, get reading. Recommendations include Fashion Theory: A Reader and The Japanese Revolution in Paris Fashion.

Finding Your Interests
---
___
The most difficult part of the whole process is determining what it is you're interested in - there's no shortage of choices, independent designers or corporate giants the quickest path to discovering them is via the internet.

To start your search think of a character from a TV show or movie whose style you particularly enjoyed. Search [Polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/search.sets) for their name or the title of what they were in and (hopefully) it will turn up hundreds of sets of clothes that draw inspiration from that character's style

Next, as it's easy to quickly scan through your archive at a later date and cull or categorise as you see fit. Once again, if you notice particular brands popping up over and over and it's not already on your list, write it down.

By now, and a score or more of retailers to search for items of interest. With that information at your fingertips, it's time for the next stage:

Trying and Buying
---
___
Once you've more or less identified the styles and aesthetics that appeal to you through extensive browsing, and start developing a relationship with a sales associate at stores you plan to frequent.  

When experimenting with a new style, rather than buying new, check eBay for an item, and sell things that don't work out. On the lower end, or for trend items you don't see lasting more than a few seasons, stop in at H&amp;M, Zara, while not of a much higher quality than their typical offerings

Most importantly, see how others react, and how you feel. If you come up with something that you love right away, that's great, but don't set it in stone until you research further and are certain it is the direction you wish to go in. Only then is it time to start investing heavily in a wardrobe.

Going Further
---
___
Once you discover the message to convey through your garments, but if it wouldn't mesh with your current wardrobe or work with two or three items at most, it's not a worthwhile purchase (for the time being). Unless you lack clothing mandatory for a particular activity, such as a job with a  dress code or uniform, you do not need an item, and certainly not an expensive designer one. To put it more succinctly, wait to purchase until you find the perfect piece.

So what should you buy? Find the key pieces that will anchor a chosen identity to your person. For example, and ultimately practical, a classic Barbour raincoat of indeterminate age might be a staple of your wardrobe. A gallery owner or curator on the other hand, may be far more attracted to the minimalism of designers such as Jil Sander and instead invest in sparsely detailed outerwear that reveals its provenance only to others of similar taste. 

Once you have identified what impression it is your trying to send, “functional”, while Brooks Brothers might be “staid”, “traditional”, and “heritage”. Both our prep aficionado and modernist would pass over these, and instead search for ones described as ""heritage"", ""classic"", or “refined”, and is an excellent addition to their wardrobe. They should not ignore it or skip purchasing

At some point in your aesthetic journey your focus may begin to change, of NYTimes fame, calls fashion “the armour to survive the reality of everyday life.” If some change calls for different armour, so be it! Never let your style be constrained by how you might have dressed in the past.

1363484814.0,1afwpt,Inspiration Album - Cyberpunk,caithnard,83,15,31,"~~where by cyberpunk I really just mean futuristic techwear~~

Inspired by the post on alternative styles the other day

**Definition:**
&gt;Cyberpunk is a Speculative Fiction genre centered around the transformative effects of advanced science

&gt;A genre that is dark and cynical in tone

(from [tv tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk))

**Album:**

[94 images

*Why cyberpunk? how is this relevant?*

If you haven't seen them already

Clothing has always been about function.  Styles like fair isle and cable knitting aren't just decorative, there's an interesting article [here](http://032c.com/2011/archetype/) about Veilance, Arc'teryx's fashion-y brand.)

Clothing isn't just about surviving the elements, but more concerned about getting hit by a car or my headphones dislodging themselves from my ear.  In backpacks, I am interested in things like [battery powered LED strips](http://depth.kr/front/php/product.php?product_no=539&amp;main_cate_no=101&amp;display_group=1).  In jackets, integrated phone / headphone pockets.  In other words, fashion that integrates with technology.  

I think part of the reason I love cyberpunk novels is that I'm studying electrical engineering, only active for the week of a conference. In engineering, sci-fi is the what-if that inspires us to create new things, cyberpunk is the what-if that lurks in the shadows of those inventions.

We can’t help you unless you help us a little first. When making your first post

* **Height**

* **Weight**

* **Age**

* **Body type**: This can be identified [here](http://www.shopyourshape.com/calculate-your-body-shape.html).

* **Why?** Why are you looking to dress better? For example, “I want to look more my age.”

* **You now**: How would you describe your current style? What are your favorite items of clothing that you currently wear? Do you not like skirts or dresses? Do you not feel comfortable wearing heels?

* **You after**: How would you describe the style you would like to achieve? Preppy? Edgy? Conservative? Loud? Do you like prints and patterns? Or maybe neutral colors?

* **Budget**: This is very important. We need to know what kind of budget you are looking to work with in order to be able to suggest viable options to you. If you’ve only got $50 to spare

### Pictures

Pictures are probably the most helpful thing you can provide. I understand it’s uncomfortable for some people to post pictures of themselves on the internet

* Your body

* Your current style of dress

* Outfits and styles that you like (can be culled from magazines, celebrity gossip sites, fashion forums, movie stills, etc. See “Resources,” below)

### Regarding haircuts and glasses:

If asking for advice on a haircut or glasses

Also

* Current length of your hair

* Goal length

* Bangs or no bangs?

* Is your hair straight? Curly? Wavy? Coarse? Smooth? Thin? Thick?

* How much time are you willing to commit to doing your hair every day? Are you comfortable with using product?

You can also check out [/r/FancyFollicles](/r/FancyFollicles) for hair advice!

Perhaps this can eventually be its own guide.

### Resources

There are many resources available to you in terms of getting exposed to fashion. These include

* Magazines: Vogue (US Edition and International Editions), Lucky, Nylon, Women’s Wear Daily, Paper Mag, Flaunt, Surface

* [Style.com](http://www.style.com): Great for runway shows. 

* [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com): A quick blogging site. If you create your own Tumblr, like their posts, and reblog them to your own Tumblr. A great way to explore Tumblr is by searching tags. For example, [“fashion”](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fashion), [“style”](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/style), and [“womenswear”]
(http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/womenswear).

* [Bloglovin](http://www.bloglovin.com): This is an easy way to keep tabs on multiple blogs at once. Sign up for an account and then browse the blogs. You can start by looking at blogs that have the most followers. These blogs include 

    [The Glamourai](http://www.theglamourai.com/)

    [Song of Style](http://songofstyle.blogspot.com/)

    [Sea of Shoes](http://seaofshoes.typepad.com/)
 
    [Fashion Squad](http://www.fashionsquad.com/)

    [Fashion Toast](http://www.fashiontoast.com) 

    Also

* Street style websites: These websites take pictures of peoples’ outfits and styles in the “real world.” Popular street style sites include 

    [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.blogspot.com)

    [Jak &amp; Jil](http://www.jakandjil.com)

    [Face Hunter](http://www.facehunter.blogspot.com)

    There are many

* Other fashion forums: There are other forums out there. Unfortunately, [Superfuture]( http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/forum/24-superfashion/), and [4chan’s /fa/](http://boards.4chan.org/fa/), the latter two being dominated by mostly males.

* [Lookbook.nu](http://www.lookbook.nu): I’m actually really reluctant to include this site; most of the looks are complete outlandish garbage. However

* Other subreddits with more specific interests:

    [/r/fashion](/r/fashion) 

    [/r/FancyFollicles](/r/FancyFollicles) 

    [/r/MakeupAddiction](/r/MakeupAddiction) 

    [/r/RedditLaqueristas](/r/RedditLaqueristas) 

    [/r/Solemates](/r/Solemates)

    [/r/shoes](/r/shoes)

Part of why I'm just starting to wear clubwear at the age of 27 is because 1) I am a relatively recent transplant to LA where clubbing is a much larger part of the social scene than when I lived in Boston and 2) I've recently lost enough weight to feel comfortable in those short

My natural style is more classic/hipster, and maybe Anthropologie. I've been trying since I lost the weight to rebuild my wardrobe with quality pieces, but club wear strikes me as a category that's too trendy to be worth spending a lot on. I have the LBD, but I kind of want to play with bright colors and sparkles too.

Seasoned shoppers of FFA - what's your strategy for buying fun sexy dresses and where do you shop? I know I can probably hit H&amp;M/Forever 21/Modcloth but I'd love some ideas for other options or lesser known websites as well.

**EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! The consensus seems to be that it really isn't worth spending a lot on quality club dresses. I guess they kind of fall into the same category as athletic gear when it comes to the French wardrobe philosophy. I'm going to haunt all these sites you've mentioned and pick out two or three dresses for some variety.

Also, everything I wear is black or white all of a sudden.

Next, things that just weren't trendy anymore) and I told myself that I could not take anything out of the garbage bag once it was in there. 

After that was done

The next task was to arrange the clothes in my closet. I began by putting those things that I *really* wanted to wear on hangers and up front so when I went to get dressed I would see them first. After that, then dresses, then shirts, then pants). And I was done.

But, and I could prove to myself that I would and could wear it, I would make a spot for it in my closet. By the end of the week, whatever was left of the pile was put in the garbage bag and donated to a thrift store. 

By the end of this, I know exactly what I'm missing and can buy accordingly. I also know, while shopping, what I can pair the item with so I don't have any unwearable items. 

Having less options of clothing makes getting dressed simple. I don't really have to think about it anymore. In the last week

Edit:

Height: 5'2

Age: 15

Body Type: hourglass

Why?: I always feel like I have nothing to wear and when I do go shopping for clothes and bring them home

You Now: I'm more of a jeans girl, (I have a weird attitude towards nice clothes lol) but I love skirts of all kinds and would love to wear them, but whenever I wear them I just feel like I'm trying to hard. I've never had a pair of shorts in my life but I'm open to them. I'm interested in the whole idea of a french wardrobe because i love the idea of mixing and matching basic things but the clothing in the french wardrobe seems to mature for someone my age. I tend to gravitate towards neutral colors and I kind of want to change that because I'm young. But I don't really know what colors I like on me and stuff. I also tend to wan to buy bohemian clothing like Free People, but for some reason I feel like clothes of that style are too hard to mix and match with so I prefer more basic things like a basic t shirt or something.

Budget: I would prefer to buy cheaper things like $15-20 a shirt because I feel bad for my parents but if they love what I pick out they'll spend up to $50 on a shirt.

(Skip past it if you care to. I'm just getting it off my chest.)

I was chatting with a friend this evening about the differences between MFA and FFA (largely how FFA tends to be more accepting because women are accustomed to differing styles and accommodating for body type

After a bit of lurking, ""Thank god these women are on the internet not in a bar somewhere.""

I responded with ""They're in a bar, he was actually really cool about it.

Anyway, it was for the benefit of fashion, and so we could communicate to one another what we hope to de/emphasize.

So

Earlier in the conversation, that I didn't want to acknowledge that we could be broken in some way.

I'm curious:  

* Do you think you have a poor body image?
* Do you perceive the body image of other FFA contributors as poor?
* Does your self-esteem negatively affect how you dress? Are there parts of your body that you try to cover up when others may deem it unnecessary?
* How has fashion influenced your confidence?

I have so many

I have been inspired by so many different sources with regard to both my aesthetic and the ethics of clothing production.  As with many things

I have spent so much time over the past year thinking about who I am and the image that I put out into the world.  Part of this starts with what I do.  I am, a farmer, a part-time professor/psychologist, and a wife (meaning that I occasionally need something just right to wear on a date night out with my amazing husband).  I need my wardrobe to meet these needs.  I need to be able to look presentable and professional.  I need to get dressed quickly.  And, I need to have pieces that can mix and match and be worn chasing my kids around a museum and then in front of a lecture-hall filled with young adults.  I also want to look pretty and sophisticated and have a recognizable style.  I want to look like *myself*.  If I had to pick a style icon it would probably be [Charlotte Gainsbourg](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/search.sets?query=charlotte+gainsbourg).  I like, simple, classic, grey

I have been in the process of losing weight and as of this moment, my local one is amazing and has tons of nice clothing.  I also sew things for myself.

I have also been trying not to buy anything with regards to craft supplies.  I have so much already and sometimes I feel overwhelmed with all that I have.  I worked through a good bit this past week, many of which I have been holding on to until I got a bit smaller.  The vast majority came from a vintage lot that I purchased two years ago from a woman who was a seamstress in the 1960s.  Her fabrics are incredible.   Getting her stash was such a windfall for me.  Her style and mine are almost identical.

[Here is a link to my imgur album with the skirts](http://imgur.com/a/SJa1d).  I would love to get some constructive feedback on the skirts.  I was trying to keep the styling very simple.  I am mostly interested to hear how people think they work as a set.  Are they cohesive?  What am I missing?  I made them to fit my body without wearing shapewear underneath

There are so many wonderful and charming younger women on here, have lost weight over the past year and are looking to really figure out their style and who they are.  I hope that some of you are willing to come out of the wood-work and let me know what you think.

I can post the info on the specific patterns/fabrics if people are interested.  The skirts with the pockets are from this [McCalls pattern](http://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m6609-products-23002.php?page_id=108).  I have made a few versions of this dress and it is really easy.  The A-line skirts are from the [Built by Wendy book](http://www.amazon.com/Sew-Built-Wendy-Making-Wardrobe/dp/0821257404/ref=pd_sim_b_1).  The other skirts were ones I self-drafted.

Thank you again for the advice you all gave me in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/yeppy/how_to_not_look_like_a_sexy_teacher_or_my/)

I took your advice and bought three new outfits today! Predictably, and White House Black Market. I mentioned that I also liked Express, but you all helpfully pointed out that those business pieces that I've been buying there are a bit too sexy, so I followed your instructions and steered clear. I DID try J. Crew, but I have yet to find a single piece of anything in that store that I like. (Although, I did try on a pair of red pants because of how much I loved this user's outfit from [this post](www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/y0s9f/red_trousers_appropriate_for_a_business_casual/), but no dice).

Here are my new outfits (I tried to get a range of styles). Please tell me your thoughts! As always, let me know. I've got all the receipts and the tags are still attached.**

**1. Black and white patterned skirt: Anne Taylor. Black cami, but I'm not sure if I like it better unbuttoned or buttoned up. [Outfit Number 1!](http://i.imgur.com/sVATU.jpg). Please let me know your thoughts on which you prefer and the outfit as a whole.

**2. Dress: WHBM.** Okay, but a ton of you said it was. So....I got another dress! (I love dresses). This one keeps my arms bare (gasp...) so I know I need to cover up somehow, but I couldn't find a way to do so without making it seem frumpy. I tried a few different blazers (black) but that made it too heavy on black - I'm thinking some color (**....maybe even a second cardigan?**) might do it, but I'm not sure. Your thoughts greatly appreciated! Or, do you think it's even okay to keep my whole arms bare? [Outfit No. 2](http://i.imgur.com/e6hQb.jpg).

**3. Pants: WHBM. Blouse, so I wanted to get an outfit a little more casual (certainly as compared to the dress) but still clean...I might have swung too far casual, but I'm not sure. I love wearing white with a bright color, so I got white slacks and a yellow, above-the-cleavage-line scoop neck blouse....**and then I saw the scarf.** I have a terrible weakness for scarves. **I am ashamed of myself for how much I paid for that scarf, but I'm sorry, FFA. I had to.** 

There's two pictures for this, so you get an awkward, lifting-my-leg-to-prevent-the-puppy-attack picture. For this one, **I tucked the shirt in, paired it with a belt, styled the scarf as an infinity, and wore nude heels to match the belt.** For the second photo, so I changed things up. **The shirt is untucked

OKAY

**PS: I was talking to the employees at White House Black Market, and I've been shopping there forever. It's not something they advertise, I suppose.

Just found this sub earlier this week and hoping you ladies (and gents perhaps?) can help me out. My beautiful baby boy is 2 months old and I am at a loss as to what to wear now. I really want to feel good about myself and I feel like I look decent.

Pre-pregnancy: Size 4-6 depending on the retailer, 34B bra, fair bit of muscle as I was/am a runner and triathlete

Now: Enorma-boobs, I can fit into my old clothes now, but I always had a nice stomach, so I have a lot of things that are tighter in that area that now look...bad. 
Measurements now:
Bust- 39""
Underbust- 32.5""
Waist (such as it is)- 33""
Hips- 40""
Inseam- 29""

Sooooooo....I'm looking for advice on general styles or specific pieces that would be good for the summer months. Ideally

My primary concerns are: 
1) Being able to nurse. So any dress has to be able to be pulled to the side to expose a boob. Shirts are fine because you can pull them up if needed. 
2) Disguising the stomach pooch. Not bragging, so I'm utterly un-used to shopping with this in mind.
3) No shorts. Never been a fan of my thighs (big and muscular...thanks

*Selecting Your Sheets: A Guide*    

Thread count is a number of single yarns in a square inch of fabric: 180 up to 800 or more.  It affects the crispness or touch of a sheet

Cotton sheets release soil easily so they can watch clean.        

Wrinkle-resistant cotton sheets can go straight from dryer to bed.  Fabric finishing technology creates a lasting memory for a smooth
         
*Cotton Sheet Glossary*        

**Combed Cotton:** a process that removes the shorter fibers from the yarn for a cleaner
**Mercerized Cotton:** finishing process for stronger
**Flannel:** plain weave cloth heavily brushed for warmth.

Wash sheets before using them for the first time.    

Cotton releases soil easily

New Wrinkle-resistant Technology lets sheets go from dryer to bed looking smooth and flat.

**All of The cotton care guide**        

*The Knack of Caring for Knits*        

Many cotton sweaters and knits are washable

To retain shape and fit

It's often best to try a sweater flat

Roll cotton knit sweaters and tees when you pack to prevent wrinkles.    

Put jewelry on after you put on knits to avoid pulling yarns.    

Dry subject: how to buy towels    

Cotton is extra absorbent

Opt for 100% cotton high quality carrying with thick

The thicker the loops

*Select a style to suit yours:*        

**Terry**: Woven on a loom which utilizes an additional yarn to form loops normal called ""pile"" or ""loop surfaces"".

**Jacquard**: features of decorative area of slightly up raised yarns
**Embellished**: to add a decorative flair to a bathroom


*Simple towel care*        

Wash towels on their own to avoid linting clothes or damaging towels with zips

Separate deep colors from lights.    

Follow instructions on care labels to avoid shrinkage.    

Mild detergent is a must and go light on the chlorine bleach; it weakens fibers.    

Using half of the recommended amount of detergent keeps towels soft.    

Never pour detergent directly on towels.    

Tumble dry

It's hanging to dry

Don't use silicone-based fabric softeners

*Say goodbye to Stains:*        

Don't wait! Treat spots right away - and repeat before drying if stain is still visible.

**Coffee**: soak in 30 minutes in stain remover and warm water


**The Cotton Shopping Guide**        

*Shirt Savvy*    

To keep white shirts white, the softer it will feel. Iron with starch for a crisper look.    

Wrinkle-resistant cotton shirts are a great choice.  Remove from dryer

Place permanent press shirts on a non rust hangers while slightly damp from the dryer.    

Shares with shoulder pads or delicate embellishments should be professionally cleaned.    


*Ten essentials for every guy*        
1.  Begin with a blazer or tailored jacket in cotton cord or canvas.    
2.  At a tailored cotton pant.  Crisp chinos are flattering to most body parts.    
3.  Grab a great woven shirt and a solid
4.  A bright polo is a must have.

Here's what I've found so far.

* [Jansport.](http://www.jansport.com/js_home.php?cfid=710346621) Jansport is really the monopoly for back to school bags: high quality bags at a low end price, so if you're willing to sacrifice that, then it's a good decision to get it in a solid color.

* [L.L. Bean.](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/816?nav=gnro-916) L.L. Bean makes backpacks similar to those you can find at Jansport, they're definitely more on the high end of the price spectrum.

* [Herschel.](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/backpack.html) Herschel is famous for their handsomely designed backpacks and rucksacks, they're in the medium price range, and good for about a year.

* [Fjällräven.](http://www.fjallraven.us/lp-18-bags.aspx) These certainly leave behind a reputation. They're high quality

Here's some of my favorite esoteric brands:

* [Ecote.](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/search.jsp?q=ecote+backpacks) Ecote is an Urban Outfitters brand, and sizes for what you need - make sure to check the dimensions, because some can be as large as a Jansport or couldn't work for school at all, like my rucksack. They show wear, but last long.

* [Canada Roots.](http://canada.roots.com/men_backpacks_and_nylon_bags/mensBagsAndBackpacks, made in Canada. They have some kickass rucksack designs and really good vintage camping inspired styles as well. Middle price range, great quality. I'd love to have one.

* [Kelty Camping.](http://www.kelty.com/c-backpacks.aspx) I have to admit, and the quality seems solid.


Here's another great post on this subject in [r/TeenMFA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/xmbpe/backpacks/)

Also - don't be afraid to thrift and use what your family has to offer. That's how you can get some of the highest quality stuff at a lower end price.

The survey is open to anyone of any bra size and the backless bra doesn't have to fit in order to fill out the survey so long as you can give information about the fit issues you had with it and the brand

I've been reading this site:  http://into-mind.com/2013/01/06/10-step-wardrobe-revamp/ --and absolutely loving it for its simplicity.  However, simple process where I don't have to think/analyze every day so I can have confidence that I look good.

One problem I'm encountering is that, one for work and one for home, and the work style has never felt like me--it feels like the costume of a more serious, awkward, boring person.  I realize I'll always have two separate sets of clothing for ""work"" and ""home"" because I just don't like dressing professionally that much, but it would be nice if I could at least find a way to make my work wardrobe feel more like me.  In the past, ""work style"" has meant whatever slacks or dark jeans I had that fit and any blouses I had and sometimes a cardigan (can you feel my enthusiasm here?)  Sometimes in winter I do sweater dresses and tights, I was sneaking things into my work wardrobe that I probably shouldn't even wear to work and trying to dress them ""up"" (bright colored skinny jeans

So

I read the sidebar guide to defining a personal style, and learning about celebs, just to help me decide what my own style is.  Is there an easier way to circumvent all of this research?  Does anyone know of an alternative approach to defining a personal style or choosing a ""uniform"" for a day to day look?

The quizzes I've taken online always put me in the creative,"" though.  I work in a vaguely creative field but still need to look put-together.  I like rich, bright colors and interesting prints.  And I like anything unique, really, and I admire people who take fashion risks--which is probably why dressing business casual has made me feel like a fake in the past.  I do also envy people who look all tidy in pencil skirts and blazers with skinny pants and sheath dresses and etc but I always feel weird when I try those things on (with blazers, it may be a fit issue though because I have broad shoulders and can never get them to lay flat across my chest when buttoned).  Is that something I'll get past with time?

If it helps, so I've never really learned how to look for a ""grown up"" job (nor have I had the money to do so). 

How did you settle on YOUR personal style?  What is your daily work ""uniform"" like?

**TL; DR: Finding a personal style is impossibly difficult for me because I'm not even sure what I like on fashion blogs and I don't know anything about celebrities and their styles.

I need some help finding summer clothes


My shoulders aren't very wide or anything but I do have a rather broad and larger than average ribcage.  My band size is 34 however it's still considerably broader above my bust (which is lacking anyways).  I have lots of stretch marks from losing weight

**Height** 5'7.5""

**Age** 19

**Measurements** My waistline is roughly 29"", however I can fit an XS/S belt with plenty of belt left.

**Body type** I'm not really sure, this is getting better but it still does kinda make clothes less flattering across the board.  I'm still in the process of losing weight and currently still have some gut, but this will be gone at some point in the summer.

**Current Sizes** I recently bought small athletic shorts, adidas brands).  ""Long and lean"" fit things tend not to fit me because of my ribcage.  A large t-shirt at American Eagle is fairly loose yet a medium doesn't really fit.  I have a large campus crew hoodie that is far too loose (pic of that [**here**](http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/686768287d0211e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7.jpg)), not sure what the smaller sizes are like on me.  A medium unisex shirt is fairly loose on me, not sure what a small is like (really should've tried this).  I have a medium top from forever21 that I could probably easily fit a small.  As mentioned my jean size is ~6, this is pretty comfy in the legs and I could probably even go down to a 4 if they're not super skinny - however it's very loose in the butt (I really have no butt).  Pic of me [**here**](http://imgur.com/IEkb9kM) in a medium adidas top (a little larger than a small nike which still fits well) and a push up bra.  I have to wear a sports bra in a large even though I have essentially no breast development and this is a little tight.

**Goals** I'd really love some kind of outfit with a skirt.  I'm not sure how I feel about shorts (I guess I should take a picture of me in my current athletic shorts).  I get pretty jealous of all these girls pulling off just wearing a tank top which in my mind looks pretty awful on me.

**Budget** I'm willing to put down $30 on a top if I find it actually does look good on me but I'd prefer lower end things.

I always feel weird if I wear bracelets + earrings + a necklace + rings, so I've been told to wear long necklaces, but all of the statement pieces I am attracted to are shorter bib length necklaces. Plus, I am really short, so when I wear those long necklaces, it feels like they are dangling by my crotch (because they are), even when I knot them they still feel long

Then there is the issue of the huge variety in my jewelry box. I've got everything from punky spiked cuffs to pearl necklaces

I've been sort of stuck in a jewelry rut lately and not taking many risks or doing anything unique or different. I wear the same bracelets every day

I feel like my jewelry box is stuck in high school or my early twenties, but it's just not my taste). I don't really like the pastel stuff I see out right now, my taste is more toward bright/bold/chunky for casual or dark/elegant jewelry for dressy. I like statement pieces, conversation starters, and am capable of making a lot of my own stuff, I just have no clear idea of what direction to go in, and no inspiration to go off of. If you have links to pictures or shops, anything would help me right now.

Contest themes will be announced on **Tuesdays**. We’ll then post the outfit submission thread the following Tuesday morning around 11AM PST.

1376128827.0,1k2zpv,"[Fashion Discussion] Fashion, the Environment, and you",,55,24, but I'd like to have a discussion about fashion

I did my homework and saw that there have been posts (one good one in particular between 1-3 months ago about Ethics and Fashion) RELATED to this topic, and let me explain.

* The manufacturing of any good comes with its environmental costs

* The fibers that make up clothing are unsustainable. [This link] (http://www.greenchoices.org/green-living/clothes/environmental-impacts) gives a brief overview of how the production of the fabrics themselves are unsustainable. Some highlights are basically that some synthetic fabrics (nylon, like cotton utilize pesticides (also not biodegradable) known to damage ecosystems and contaminate the water supply, as well as being actually responsible for human deaths each year.

* [This link] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964887/) gives a more journalistic approach to the issue and Demonstrates the consumer culture at play here. A highlight:

&gt;Only about one-fifth of the clothing donated to charities is directly used or sold in their thrift shops. Says Rivoli

   While the article goes on to explain that excess clothing is often sold to be recycled

Another highlight:
&gt;According to Well Dressed?


These are just an extremely brief overview of the major issues at play here (wasteful consumer culture

In the meantime, frankly), but I don't let these seemingly contradicting ideals stand in the way of me living a life that I'm proud of. Yes, I buy things new that aren't sustainably made at times (although I always do it when those items are on clearance, so the store doesn't make as much if any profit off of the item, excepting under wear stuffs). Here are a few tips of mine if you're interesed.

**My suggestions for cutting down on your impact as a fashionista**

* As many people already suggest

* Always try to buy used first. If sifting through a thrift store isn't your thing, and it's usually cheaper.

* Support eco-friendly clothing products. I personally have a few great items made out of bamboo, etc. In a consumer culture like most of ours, purchasing power is a bigger factor than people realize. Added benefit: Natural and organic fibers are so much more comfortable on the skin (at least in my opinion).

* Wash your clothes less often. Added benefit: They'll last longer and look better. I legitimately only wash things if I (or my boyfriend) can smell it or if I accidentally get something on the item (and then it's usually a hand wash).

* When you do wash your clothes

* In FFA threads

* In a similar vein, and organic alternatives for your beauty products. I use organic face makeup, bamboo makeup brushes, natural mineral lip stuff, and all of my moisturizers and cleansers are all organic and natural. (I have been unable to find organic eye stuff.) Added benefit: It's better for your skin, better for your hair. I can't tell you how many compliments I get on how clear my skin in and how soft my hair is.

**What’s a Good Photo look like?** A good photo shows your entire outfit, fit and proportions of your outfit.* There should be enough light that we can see every part of your outfit equally clearly – for good advice, guessing doesn’t work. The best photo angle is straight on. “Lifestyle” shots are okay, as long as we can clearly see the details of the outfit and the picture is of just you.


**Required Equipment:** You don’t need a fancy-dancy camera or tripod to take a quality photo submission. A point and shoot or a laptop with a webcam is really all you need. I don’t recommend using a phone camera because even the iPhone/Android tends to be blurrier than necessary or distort the colors of the image. 


**How do I get a good image?** The best thing to do is to get someone else to take the picture for you. It can be a little awkward, this sounds dumb. I follow this style forum and I wanted to post my outfit for feedback.” When they laugh at you, remember that fashion is pain.  But seriously, the easiest way to go about getting a good picture is just to ask.


**But I’m Forever Alone!** If you can’t get anyone else to take the picture, make sure that you can see your entire outfit – it may take a few tries to get it right, and this is where an inexpensive tripod can work wonders. 


**Can’t I just take it in the mirror?** No! Mirror pictures either need to be taken at a strange angle and throw off the proportions of the outfit and have you doing a crazy


**Where should I take the picture?** Outdoors and in natural light is the best


**But I don’t want to post my face on the Internet!** Posting your face on the internet can be sketch, *or draw an oval that fits the size of your face exactly.* Any smaller or larger will throw off the proportions of your body, so don’t copy and paste a celebrity face, either. 

*To easily cover your face on a mac: open the picture with Preview. Go to Tools


**How should I pose?** Again


**Can’t I just take a picture of the clothes?** Absolutely not. Even if you’re just asking wether two colors match or not, the best thing to do is to put on the outfit as you plan on wearing it so we can get a holistic view.*


**Do I NEED to submit a photo?** Most likely, your current style, and clothes you’re into help us determine the best advice to give you. We can’t judge a description of an outfit. 


**To Recap

Have someone else take the picture for you or use your self-timer.

Get your entire body

Use natural lighting so that we can get an accurate view of the colors. 

Put on the outfit as you plan on wearing it. 

Feel free to use an alt account and cover your face.

Pose naturally!

**Don’t:**

Take the picture in the mirror

Take a picture of just the clothing.

Post only a description of the outfit.

Cover your entire head so we can’t make an accurate judgment of proportion.

Submit a photo from too far away or with three other people in it

1366816703.0,1d0i0u,Preview of FFA's plus-size resources spreadsheet (and call for contributors) + announcement of FFA's Sidebar Summer project—to beef up our sidebar and make the subreddit even better!,Schiaparelli,54,9,45,"## Plus-size resources

First things first: I've realized for some time that **if FFA is to be a truly diverse and welcoming and helpful community to women of all stripes and styles, that means compiling a list of plus-size resources: bloggers, shops, industry-oriented sites, whatever. The increasing amount of requests for plus-size advice has made it clear that this is something that could be really helpful for FFA, and it also highlights our commitment to diversity in fashion and in this subreddit.

**[Here's the current draft spreadsheet of plus-size resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7vKDQhKwdodEZXczJzUVlzb04zSlZnYkVwX2NwbHc#gid=1)**! You'll note a few things:

* It's somewhat short and incomplete. *Read below for how you can help
* There's a blog sheet and a shops sheet. *I know /r/plussize has a list of shops already

I chose to separate the plus-size resources from the official blogroll we have now ^(which by the way is gonna get revamped as well

The reason for this announcement is to **publicize the link for people who don't know about it**

***

## FFA's Sidebar Summer

It's clear that from [past discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15weq9/ffa_whats_missing_from_the_sidebar/) and current questions that there's a lot of information that FFA frequently requests or wants—and it would be *wonderful* if we had a few more resources we could point people to in that regard!

Depending on interest in the idea, here's what I'm thinking—it's almost summer. I like alliteration. I'm planning on doing a huge content push for FFA over the summer *anyways* and I think it'd be really fun if we had more than a few people all working on content and relying on each other for support/help. It's been wonderful to see how dedicated and interested many FFAers are in the progress of the subreddit, so I'm inviting you to pitch in and help out the community at large.

Specifically—bulking up our sidebar. Here's a list of the initiatives people have expressed interest in previously:

* /u/aneong and /u/dwindling: high fashion coverage + discussion of fashion labels and runway collections
* /u/ifilmmachat (and possible /u/lostafarian): intro to prep and menswear style
* /u/SuperStellar: materials guide and garment care (probably taking cues from her excellent guide on [bra care](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16qlui/a_guide_to_bra_care/) for /r/abrathatfits
* /u/thethirdsilence: interview wear for various situations
* /u/wikifrench: walkthrough on a DIY/garment construction project

For those listed—please don't take this as a guilt trip ^(well

If you *want* to contribute something to FFA—an inspiration album, **I highly encourage you to try and start that**. FFA now has an incredibly diverse and knowledgeable community—in the past the majority of subreddit content was created by the moderators, but I'm hopeful now that there are members of our community that can help out a great deal as well. Some ideas for content you could contribute:

* guide on getting started with a certain style
* guide on tailoring and alterations
* a walkthrough for a particular DIY/fashion project
* a writeup on fashion history or a particular designer/brand
* guide on a particular item (tees, whatever)

I'll also add that good discussions—and these do an immense deal to create value in the subreddit

***

## Anticipated Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I help with the plus-size resources?** 

* *Small contributions*: Comment here or PM me with content you'd like to see included (whether blogs
* *Larger or long-term contributions*: If you'd like to get more seriously involved—please PM me with your email address

**I want a similar resource for some other demographic/topic!** Given how busy the moderation team is, *please feel free to write your own guide!* I highly suggest posting in this thread or posting a new thread asking for volunteers to collaborate with, as well. I'll work with you guys to make the content sidebar-worthy, if that's your goal. However, I'll note that any kind of thorough and helpful content being produced on behalf of the sub will earn you my undying gratitude in any case.

**What is sidebar-worthy/worthy of being included in an official FFA compendium of resources?** Briefly—something that meets the standards we already have in our sidebar or in one of the compilations (reasonably comprehensive, like particularly good discussions, may not necessarily be sidebar-able due to the specificity of the topic, but might be well-worth including there.

Hey  FFA

Many people have requested someone write up a list/guide to various brands
beginners have an idea of where to start. Since there's a lot of stores
we're pretty lazy/busy
form anyone can fill out to describe a Store/Brand; we'll collate all the
results and create a database from them (after some data sanity checking) that
can be easily searched and referenced by newcomers and long-time members alike.

Below is a list of brands that we quickly scraped
the comments and we'll add them to the list. As people submit info
them through so you know when a response has been accepted and we don't see too
many repeats. We look forward to your submissions!

1344188543.0,xpzao,Plus sized girl looking for business casual advice,OhMyCrayon,51,4,14,"Hey girls! I have a few questions and I figured this was the place to ask them :)


**Why?**

I'm a 22 year old girl with long blonde hair. I'm starting college (again) soon and I want to look better. Since I've always been a plus sized girl I never had much to choose from when I was younger, or whether I needed it or not. So now I have a whole lot of stuff and some basic outfits I like to wear, but I want to be taken more seriously and want to be able to represent myself in a stylish fashion every day, and not just some of the days and look like a slob the rest.


**Measurements**

Weight: 95 - 99kg / 209-218 lbs (according to google) Lately it's been the latter

Length: 178-180cm / 5'10'' 

Bra size: 85 C (I live in Europe


**Shape**

I'm not sure which body shape I have, I don't have big calves or ankles.


**Things I already know (or believe to know)**

I try to refrain from lighter jeans as they give the optical illusion of having even bigger legs. I always try to wear dark denim jeans with no washed up or worn down (lighter) patches on the upper leg area as I've heard this makes them appear bigger as well. Basically my everyday look always includes high waisted dark denim jeans
Since I'm quite tall I don't usually take time or effort to wear high heels


**Some pics of my body:**

http://imgur.com/a/ok4CN#0 


**Some pics of my current style of dressing:**

http://imgur.com/a/4bBpu#0


**My desired style:**

I'd like to own some more dresses and especially skirts. Right now I have absolutely no clue what to wear when it comes to skirts, so maybe this would be fixed by buying better quality clothes at more expensive shops (?). Since I'm starting college I would like to be taken seriously, so the style I want to go for is business casual I believe, however I want to keep it feminine and a little sexy, and not too boring. Also, this ( http://i.imgur.com/K9mxA.jpg ) is my new school bag, I have some other bags too but I'm planning on using this one mostly, what kind of clothes should I wear with it? Any way that I can involve the belt


I used to wear gothic style clothes way back (the antique style, and I love lolita clothes although I wouldn't necisarily wear them. I don't have a problem with trying some of that stuff or incorporating certain elements of that.


**Some pics of desired style:**

http://productimages.wehkamp.nl/is/image/Wehkamp/357550_pb_01/2009artikelDetailVisualLandscape/promiss-regulier-blouse-l-blauw.jpg


**Budget:**

Well since we have different stores here (Netherlands) I don't think it would be very useful to you guys to know, but preferably less. 


**Stuff I don't really like:**

I'm willing to try basically anything to see if it works

- Huge floral prints

- Skirts longer than knee

- Denim jackets

- Light denim jeans


**Questions:**

- I love to wear longer stuff in an effort to hide my thighs
- I really like skinny jeans
- I've been having great problems trying to find the right skirt for me. I've read that flared skirts go well for pear shapes
- I love the idea of having a belt midwaist or like, but I've been hearing different stories, one says small belts are the way to go if you're plus-size and the other says big belts. Advice? :D
- I'm not quite sure which kind of top I need to wear. I've been reading a top that draws attention to the breast/shoulder area. I think in my case it would be breast area? However I do not own stuff with lots of details added to the neckline and I am on a budget.


I dont have much problems with showing off some cleavage, which then makes it kind of okay. I also am quite self-conscious when I sit down to check if there are no curves showing, but I guess permenantly wearing shapewear would kind of fix this. 


To be short: I'm a plus-sized girl looking for some advice and tips on what and how to wear it. I'm on a budget. What are some basic things I should add to my wardrobe?

I'm 5 foot 4 inches, but it is actually pretty easily tamed and I can look pretty flat when properly tucked in, so as long as nobody says, ""WOO CROP TOPS, BABY"" I can probably figure out a way to accommodate things requiring a flat-ish stomach to look good.

See, and that looks completely awful on me now.

At the moment, even though I adore dresses and being fancy. I love twee, bohemian styles, and rockabilly fashion, but because I don't know what looks good on me anymore (and most of my clothing falls off of my body) I just go the boring Walmart jeans and t-shirt route.

Measurements are:

30"" underbust

36"" standing bust

38"" leaning bust

29"" at the smallest part of my waist

38"" at the widest part of my torso when measured loosely but 

30"" when constrained

41"" hips (baby got back)

30"" inseam

Do you like to look neat or more disheveled? 

I find I like many styles best when people cut against type. A very neat polished punk rock type look looks more interesting to me than a disheveled one. My ideal conception of my style is an elegant dishevelment--I like a lot of tailored pieces (blazers, but in general I try to play with my clothing a bit (partial cuffing etc) to further this. However, I have a hard time with the line between looking a little disheveled/dgaf and not just looking messy.

edit: I think this preference evovles from the fact I enjoy over-dressing and it's really hard to get my hair to look 'neat'.

&gt;line says there's a growing public consensus that the mass production of so much cheap clothing is an enormous waste of resources such as fuel and water.

I hadn't realized (beyond our sub at least) that fast fashion is becoming less popular.

Do you think this is accurate? What do you think the future of these chains are if cheap fashion maybe be coming to an end?
