There was also a fateful bug: you were allowed to slide down slopes at high speeds by pressing space bar really, jetted from the bottom of the hill high into the air, spotted a far-away hill, timed your jetting so as to land on that downward slope, and gained even more speed. 

The main gametype was capture the flag. Since there was no speed cap, and a lot of strategic depth resulted. Tribes 2 was released in 2001 and unfortunately arrived somewhat broken, in terms of game crashes, physics, random dead-stops on invisible seams, overpowered vehicles and a general feeling that you were moving in molasses. After a few years, the community had modded it into a brilliant state. 

Eventually master server support was lost, since the company that released it no longer exists. Considering the game's age, I find the graphics to be elegantly done. But that could just be nostalgia speaking. Anyone's computer should be able to run it.

The only ""problem"" is that Tribes 2 still has a small but thriving community. There is still at least one full server a night. If it's not obscure enough

1312904514.0,jdkc3,Playdate FAQ,rooftoptile,88,8,33,"**Q: Why was this subreddit created?**

A: Reddit User Schnevets was tired of fun games with dead communities. He posted this rage comic to /r/gaming and the response was huge. /r/Playdate was created by anr0b

**Q: So who decides what games get played? Is it Santa?**

A: You do! Thanks to /r/Playdate user (and now moderator) rooftoptile's voting system, or submits a new idea. From the top submissions, the games for the week will be chosen. Often, there will be some category of game that are required for the week, and the top that fits that requirement will be picked. Examples of these categories are “Free on Friday” or “Multi platform on Monday.”

**Q: So

A: First of all, it can’t be chosen every week, and it won’t gum up the dates so there’s room for games with less followers to get a chance too. Also, this community was created from a group of like-minded redditors, who all want to see less popular games get their day in the light. Hopefully, with the categories of the week and the limit on repeats, it will be enough to let the community pick the games they want

**Q: I think Obscurotron 2000: Nostalgia Factor X would be a perfect game

A: Just because there’s an official playdate game, The official dates are here to pick the OFFICIAL game of the day, and the other threads are for organizing unofficial playdates. The Mods will NEVER shut down an alternate playdate, and even encourage it! Instead of posting “We should play Game X someday” post “Alternate Playdate: Game X on Tuesday!” We only ask, that since this community is new, try and have a little patience. I bet we’ll get to your game as an official date soon!

**Q: Popular Shooter: Day of WWII Zombies is picked for Monday! That’s bullshit

A: Yes, “NO! That game is FORBIDDEN!” Making that kind of decision would be more controversial than just letting Popular Shooter have its day, and setting up the community so that the other 59 out of 60 days are more in line with the communities expectations. May we suggest, on that day, if you are upset by Popular Shooter getting all up in your playdate business, you read a nice book, play one of the 4000 games you have on steam you never played

**Q: Alright, created by /r/Playdate user (now moderator) Douchebag_Alphamale, where you can participate in the group chat to organize games (Steam Group LINK) and an IRC channel for non-steam games. Don’t forget there’s also in game server browsers. Put {R} in front of your handle/steam name, and if you host a server, put {R} in front of it.

**Q: You guy’s know I’m poor right?**

A: Every week, and it’s not expected. The community is organized around players reviving a game the love for a day. If you want to buy an older game you’ve never played before to join in the fun, awesome! But at a game a day, and at least one free game, there will be pleanty of options as long as you’re patient.

**Q: Why are we playing some games twice in a week? I thought there was a 2 month limit?**

A: The most well attended two game of the past week are played again at the end of the week before the next round. That means successfully revived games don’t have to wait 2 months for more action

**Q: This is mostly good

A: Everyone is going to have their opinion on how this should work, and see what works, and what needs tweaking. With these rules, we’re trying to be as inclusive as possible, while maintaining the original goal, without being overly authoritative. It’s a tough plate to balance. And of course, we want to know what you think would help make the community better. Send us a moderator mail, but we want to try this system out first before we make radical changes.

**TL;DR** Start submitting and voting. You can have multiple submissions

If you should ever find it in the kindness of your heart to gift me a spare copy of a playdate game, I would be more than grateful. I'm not asking for payment though, because just seeing you all participate in these events is motivation enough for me to keep scheduling these playdates for you!

Factions gain power for each player added. The amount of power added to the faction decreases the more players the faction has.  A faction can be sieged with TNT cannons only when it's members are online

Factions can form strategic alliances with one and another. Leaders are able to customize how other factions

1317793384.0,l1ffk,"r/Playdate, Let's discuss Eternal Silence, a free space combat Source Mod that we will be playing on Saturday!",Incursus,51,25, so I thought I'd get a thread started now. 

Eternal Silence is a class based space combat game that also includes infantry combat. The ships fly and handle similarly to the ones in Battlefront II

Each team starts with a capital ship and three Corvettes (defensive ships that fire high powered lasers and are lined with many turrets). You will spawn on foot inside of the capital ship and have your choice of a multitude of different ships. 

There are two parts to every round. In the beginning, but it is quite vulnerable and needs an escort. Whoever loses their three corvettes first then goes into defensive mode, and we now proceed to part 2: capturing the defending team's capital ship. This is all seamless, and if the defending team prefers to fight in space, they can. However, the attacking team will now be able to land inside the defender's capital ship and begin to capture it piece by piece by holding 3 or 4 control points inside the ship. Once captured, the attackers score, and the round goes back to part 1. 

This game is very innovative and is by far the most original and enjoyable source mod I've played yet. Best of all, you have no reason not to download it! If you don't have a source game yet, go buy Portal 2, it's only $15 today!

I'm looking for a dedicated gamer friend who isn't shy on trying new games or discussing playing games together. Such as diablo 3, star wars the old republic. Where we wait for each other, experience the game together, and maybe perhaps share our lives with each other in a friendly way.

I believe that experiencing a game with friends is much more enjoyable then a single player experience. However, I won't butt into their ""single player"" game time too much as i myself have not complete KoA. 

I'm an only child. So I rarely have anybody to play with. I've met a few people online. However

Most of my real life friends aren't really gamers and as such

I've been searching for such a friend/group for a long time and one of my good online friends introduced me to this sub-reddit and after a lot of consideration

&gt;The goal for the survivors is to stay alive and to spot the suiciders. They have a couple of throw-able copies of the book: “Gardening for Beginners – by Barbara Bush” as a self-defense weapon.

&gt;The goal for suiciders is to sneak up close enough to the survivors in order to blow themselves up. Because each map is full of shrubberies its very hard to spot a real suicidal pot plant among the many fake ones. If a shrubbery isn’t moving

Description:

Eternal Silence is a fast-paced tactical multiplayer space shooter! There are five ship classes to choose from: The Fighter, Interceptor, and Dropship. Each ship has strengths and weaknesses, and the different classes rely heavily on teamwork to operate effectively. Gameplay in Eternal Silence is highly reminiscent of the space battle levels from Battlefront 2 -- two capital ships and several other smaller ships with a mix of fighters thrown in. The objective is to capture the enemy's ship by boarding and holding a control point. The weapons are pretty standard, a space shooter assault rifle and pistol. The assault rifle has the unique ability to be mounted as a sentry and fired remotely.

Description:

Probably one of the most interesting shooters out on the market due to the creativity of its gameplay, zero gravity rolled into a first person shooter. Your suit has the ability to create an artificial gravity on any surface you fly to... but you will probably be spending a lot of time getting disoriented -- in a fun way -- flying around the maps. It's disorienting due to being able to spin in space while not on a surface, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. 

Shattered Horizon is quite creative and you'll find a bunch of cool details the developers put into it. For instance since you can't hear gunshots and sounds in space, it's cheap, fun and creative!

Frozen Synapse is a simultaneous turn-based strategy game focused on squad-based combat. You play out tactical situations in various scenarios, extermination, secure, etc. Each turn, players give orders to their squad, and after submitting their turn the game engine plays the outcome. Think chess on steroids.

Frozen Synapse has an immersive single-player campaign, Twitter, and YouTube integration (replays can be submitted straight to Youtube).

It should be noted that Frozen Synapse can be played as slow as chess-by-mail. You can play many matches simultaneously at your own pace. You can submit your turn

Band together with other players to build the ultimate civilization and become an unstoppable force.  Place and collect bounties on other players, setup trading posts, and lead an army to conquer all who stand in your way.  The aim of the game is to prosper and crush your enemies.

&gt;I’d forgotten how ludicrously characterful the game is. The strange tale of abandoned tribes and mushroom gods, waiting for a victim. Or the rocket propelled glider that takes you up the critical central 'battleship' balloon, that is often the focus of any single battle.
&gt;
&gt;The game itself is an interesting tension between slow-moving aircraft, grapple the underside of the ship, fight on deck, fall again, and up in a sword battle dangling from the bottom of an airship, really is quite something to behold. i was watching one battle where one of our pilots was fighting two enemies, hanging from the bottom of the ship on a grapple, died

This is one of those mods  in need of a revival

There was  a campaign recently that attracted around 30+ ish to the server on sunday evenings(Afternoon US). However it hasn't quite caught people into playing often.

I had also (not affiliated with FS in any way) tried posting the campaign battles on reddit to hopefully drum up interest with varying success. I thought after seeing multiple OMG I WANT A STAR WARS BATTLEFIELD upvote frenzy and ZOMG WANT BATTLEFIELD 3

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/hsro4/stay_on_target_were_too_close_stay_on_target/

Imo it is much more fun than battlefront 1+2

This comes from squad leaders being able to lay spawn points, which when played with large numbers are very tactical and you have to line up your ships concentrate fire and ressuply with a vunerable barge.

I know reddit hates it but bf2142 is on origin http://store.origin.com/store/eaemea/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/ThemeID.850300/productID.85062100 it isn't exactly a bomb of a price and bf2142 is also a good game too.

Part of the reason imo that first strike hasn't at the moment got a larger player base is a lot to do with the absoloutly and utterly retarded system they had with the 1.51 update. To this point there is still an incorrect 1.51 version on the EA forums which is labeled 'final version'. However on the First strike forums there are lots of set up guides. http://forums.fsmod.com/viewtopic.php?id=9938

We had all hoped and prayed it would get onto steam after bazzas announcement which migh have got rid of the version problems but alas that seemed to fail. http://i.imgur.com/iczR5.png

I haven't used the origin service but this might update correctly automatically.

**TL;DR If you like star wars then you are missing out by not playing this. If you like slightly more tactical experiences this might be your flavour too. This mod really deserves a breath of life as the developers still continue to play what they created even with a little less numbers.**

1345484448.0,yj6yu,[ANNOUNCEMENT] We're taking a break this week. More on what that means and the potential for a TF2 game night inside.,Jomskylark,35,7,18,"Hey all

We've opted to take a break this week and not select any official games nor focus times. This is due in part to not receiving any nominations throughout the week and therefore being unable to hold a vote. Looking at a steady decline of nominations over the past few weeks we think that this may be a reflection of problems with the new nominating/voting system and as such

Additionally, and general participation of games and focus times will likely drop. We hope that by providing a week off those users will be able to better focus on their transition and come back next week ready to game.

That said, August 25 beginning at 8:00 PM EDT. Let us know if you're interested so we can determine if there'll be enough in numbers.

Finally, ask if people are interested in playing with you, or take the initiative and schedule a game time/server for people to play.

Also, August 24. If we get enough nominations, voting will begin Saturday, August 25 and we'll select games on Monday, August 27.

Thanks for reading and have an awesome week!

1343368586.0,x8h1h,Casual PC gamer dad looking for Steam friends [Mumble][US/CST],DerelictMan,34,3,51,"Hi

I'm a gamer in US-CST with kids looking for other easy-going

* Usually play late (10pm-1am CST normally)
* Typically cannot guarantee that I'll be online in advance

I'm up for most anything on my [games list](http://steamcommunity.com/id/JackTorrents/games
)

* Borderlands
  * I've put only 7 hours into this so far.  Because of my erratic schedule I can't commit to a dedicated co-op group
* Portal 2
  * I've played most of the stock co-op levels
* Left 4 Dead 2
  * New to this too... I've only played 2 scenarios so far
* PAYDAY: The Heist
  * I've played 3 of the scenarios in this
* Team Fortress 2
  * I'm a casual pubber at this game... I have extensive Quake and UT experience, and TF2's metagame and memes bewilder me sometimes.  I think it'd be a lot of fun to team up with a buddy and see what a couple of players who cooperate can accomplish.
* Saints Row: The Third
  * 11 hours in
* Tribes: Ascend
  * I'm not a hard core tribes person, and the game is 10 times more enjoyable that way to me...

I'm looking for gamer friends with working microphones only.  I prefer Mumble and have a server available

1) Everyone should use the same connection type. We used Excellent with good results in 2-4 player Mario Kart.

2 Everyone should use the same game client and the same video plugin. We had best results with Jabo's Direct3D8 1.6

3) Go to options &gt; settings &gt; options tab. Uncheck 'pause emulation when window not active'. Then

4) Go to Options &gt; Configure Controller Plugin &gt; Make sure ""none"" is selected for plugin and then click Assign Keys to setup your 360 or playstation controller buttons.

Remember those popular games back in the day that involved Worms? You know, but the player takes control of little hedgehogs.

It's basically a free multiplayer turn-based game where players fight against each other in deathmatch or team deathmatch type game-modes. Each player gets their turn to plan out how they are going to kill their opponent's Hedgehogs, from grenades to remote-control fighter planes; countless of ways to have fun. Players can also customize their lineup of hedgehogs with a wide variety of skins (such as Ryu from Street Fighter or Sonic from Sonic the Hedgehog).

**Original**: Hello everyone. I'm with Arcen Games

What we're giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10

All Steam sales end January 2

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck. Happy new year as well!

Love

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,t5_2spg8,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/nyh9p/happy_new_year_rplaydate_we_have_a_few_leftover/

1341949836.0,wcejh,[ANNOUNCEMENT] New Voting Method!,Jomskylark,28,4,4,"**Introduction**

---

Here at Playdate we strive to provide the best services to our users and are always looking for new ways to innovate and impress. [continue obligatory and super cheesy political speak.]

... Alright! So here's the deal. Over the past several months we have been tweaking our voting system and it has finally culminated in a major system change. We have detailed the process below

1. *Plenty of time to nominate or vote.* You may now nominate Wednesday - Friday
2. *Voting couldn't be easier.* Just upvote the games you want to play! Also
3. *No more confusion!* Each component (nominating &amp; voting) is now separate

[**Check out this image before reading for a visual timeline!**](http://i.imgur.com/46cEo.jpg)

---

**Here's how NOMINATING works.**

---

- With the new method you are able to nominate for a much longer time than previous iterations of the nominating process. Nominating typically begins sometime on Wednesday and closes early Saturday morning*.
- The nominating phase is now separated from the voting phase. A new nominating thread is posted weekly and there will always be a button in the sidebar directing users to the active thread
- Simply post your game suggestion in the nomination thread! You can post up to three suggestions. There are a couple of minimal rules when nominating
- When the nominating phase ends and the voting phase begins
- If the nominator wishes to edit or remove their nomination after it's been posted in the voting thread

---

**Here's how VOTING works.**

---

- You will have approximately 36 hours to vote
- To vote
- After voting ends on Sunday, nominate it again! :)

---

**The fine print.**

---

For ease of explanation there are a few things I purposely left out.

- *Nominating closes right before voting begins, I think the best way to handle these inconsistencies is to encourage users to submit their nominations before 6:00 AM EST on Saturday, as I definitely won't close nominating/open voting before then! ... I probably won't even be awake before then. ;)
- The Steam notification for the nomination thread won't be posted until a day or so after it's posted in the subreddit -- think Thursday evening. The point of this is to encourage users to nominate on their own without needing to be notified

---

**TL;DR**

---

If you're confused

- Nominating opens Wednesday - Friday for nominating and Saturday - Sunday for voting. There will be a big bold banner at the top of each nomination thread that states if nominating is open or closed (and the same for voting). Pay attention to it and you'll be fine!
- If you'd like to nominate a game
- To vote

**The demo is free and supports multiplayer so you won't have to shell out any cash to play with us. However

Altitude is a fierce contest of ace vs ace, the game will stretch you to the limit from the upper reaches of the stratosphere and the relics of a long forgotten city, to within the deepest hollows of underground caverns. The sirens have sounded, bogies are coming in hot… jump into the fast and agile Loopy and drop your enemies from the sky with a tactical EMP blast - but get out of the way before your Biplane support tears them to pieces with 20mm cannons blazing! Barrel roll through the enemy minefield and arm your nuke as you enter the drop zone. There it is - the enemy base - but two Mirandas just warped in with lasers hot, and an Explodet is lumbering into position over its hangar deck — will you carry your team to victory?

Neotokyo Start: 9pm GMT - 4pm EST. Neotokyo runs off the source engine so (I think you only need a source game to run it) There is a regular community Friday play so we may have to move to another server if it gets full. I think how we are going to do it is start off in a separate server just to see how many show up and if there is only a few we will move over to the community game. The way we will tell who is who is by adding a [r] or {r} tag in front of our names (It is on the old source engine so you don't need to change your steam name just your name in-game)

The event reminder will be in our steam group and we also have another reminder for [/r/Playdate](/r/Playdate)s event later too as age of chivalry is another great mod. If anyone is interested it is [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rgamemods)

Description:
Neotokyo is a mod which is set in the near future heavily influenced by Ghost in the Shell both in some of the weapons and objectives (The ghost) but also the dystopian art style. The game could be comparable to css in its reliance on teamplay however the 3 different classes and the meticulous map design creates a much more tense and strategic environment.

I hope to see some of you there

Note:

 *btw I realise this might be a bit early for some but as we are only small we try to get it so that there is a chance for both Euro + American timezones can play together

Happy holidays! One of the challenges with scheduling events for a large community is that everybody has varying amounts of stress on various days. And we can't really do much about that without screwing over other people.

However, New Year's, and festive parties may result in the next couple of weeks being slow in activity here in /r/Playdate. Or maybe it won't!

That's what we want to know. We want responses from you guys!

* How busy are the next two weeks looking for you?
* Will there be more
* Is there an abundance of real life activities or little/no change?
* Is the stress of real life events going to make playing games undesirable or desirable?
* What Steam game would you put on a wishlist for Santa?

Those are just some loose questions to get the ball rolling. Feel free to explain your situation by answering some or none of those questions!

The moderators are actively discussing creative workarounds to make the next couple of weeks fun and not stressful. This information will help us figure out what to do.

San Andreas is, but many people are still playing it - and the two online mods have, without a doubt, had much to do with that fact.

**What is MTA:SA?**

MTA:SA is an *open source* modification that aims to implement a full-blown multiplayer experience to the well-known game GTA:SA (and succeeds remarkably well), allowing astounding amounts of gameplay variety. As a fun fact, I can also mention that MTA doesn't modify any game data, all modding happens ""live"" using memory modification.

**What can be done in it?**

Almost anything. Favorite gamemodes include pure deathmatch, racing, freeroaming, etc., but these don't really do justice to the scripting system. The possibilities are (and I say this knowing fully that it sounds like a cliché) nearly endless.

Setting up an MTA server is actually pretty easy, relatively simple, and well-documented pattern.

**What's wrong with it?**

MTA's player base is, and due to certain... differences in opinion, the principial developer of the other one has a grudge towards MTA. The competition between the mods has never really been fair, and so one ended up with the sizeable community, while MTA got the short straw in that respect. 

At the moment, and the communication is often hampered by language barriers. The English-speaking population seems mostly to be concentrated around role-playing, but... role playing isn't for everyone.

In addition to the lack of communication

**What do I wish to accomplish?**

I've followed the GTA multiplayer scene for a while. I originally started with the previously mentioned competitor, gameplay and scripting features. After that, I spent some time playing and scripting, and I even ran my own fairly successful server at one point.

Since MTA has such incredible potential in the right hands

**Questions?**

Ask them in the comments. While I haven't been too active in MTA lately

****TL;DR?****

MTA is a cool mod

Hi all

While Thanksgiving will technically fall on a Thursday, the Steam Thanksgiving/Black Friday sale. Last year's sale lasted five days and encompassed hundreds of sweet deals.

So instead of sticking to the normal routine, or just take a break. We'll be back on our normal schedule the week of Monday, November 26.

When the sale begins, and plan unofficial focus times. You can also talk about general Thanksgiving gaming.

Note that nominating games for the week of Monday, November 24 at ~11:00 AM EDT. Voting will begin immediately afterwards. This would be a great opportunity to nominate a game on sale -- especially considering we only have two entries right now! We will put a reminder when the deadline gets closer.

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below)
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The three selected games will be played all next week
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

Utilizing the Cube engine, take the flag, and score without ever firing a shot -- although there will probably be some angry enemies chasing you. :)

One of the major differences I've noticed with other shooters is how Sauerbraten maps are like a massive jungle gym. I've never played an FPS where you can literally climb onto the buildings and fight on top of them... it's so much fun to see how high up you can get.

* Several unique and competitive game modes
* A variety of weapons
* Numerous maps
* Fast-paced movement
* Simple UI and quick (!) loading times

**BLOODLINE CHAMPIONS'S FOCUS TIME WILL BE HELD SUNDAY (11/20) AT 8:00 PM EST. [DISCUSS FOCUS TIME HERE!](http://redd.it/mfeli)**

Bloodline Champions is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) that is very unlike the more popular MOBAs, and has most similarities with the World of Warcraft Arena. You have a champion with special abilities, but are not limited by Mana, but merely by cooldowns of each ability. Each champion available in the game is balanced with teamplay in mind, and thus teamplay is very important throughout the game.

Typically a match is a ""best of 5"" round

The game has a matchmaking system that *mostly* works when you want to battle against players of your own skill level

It is very fun once it gets going, where you can meet up with other redditors and play together.

A Source mod is a collection of textures, scripts and code that runs on the Half-Life 2 engine. That engine's name is, appropriately, the Source engine. To allow the installation of a Source mod you must install the Source SDK. You can find it on your Steam client by following the following steps:

* Open the Steam window.
* Go to the Library.
* Change the list to Tools.
* Find and double-click on the Source SDK item.
* Read over the dialog box and click Download and Install / Next to continue
* The Source SDK will then be downloaded to your computer via Steam. 
* ([Link to Valve's How-to](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Installation))

Most of the bigger Source mods out there are available on Steam under the Mod category, there are usually instructions on the website.

Generally, all you can play are total overhaul mods. If you buy a source game though, you get the source SDK base which includes models &amp; textures from Half-Life 2, but likely not maps or sounds.

It should be noted that an easy way to get the HL2 textures and models is by having an ATI video card. [Here's the details on this Steam offer](http://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/). Suffice to say

Hey everyone, however I figured I'd let anyone in this sub use it to play games together and help make it a bit more lively. As a guest on the server you'll have the permissions required to create temporary channels at will and use it for as long as you want with no questions. The only rule is use common sense about where you should make the channel and how you should act in public channels and just listen to any admins obviously, don't need to register or anything just hop on and play. If you have any issues with permissions just poke an admin (preferably me, Kriegen.) and we'll help you out however we can.

* Games have already been nominated
* We will be selecting three games to play.

* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also

|=====|

Do not attempt to play it if your computer is underspecced


You might have the best gaming PC there is out there


This game is free to play but is generally not ""pay to win"". Closest thing to pay to win is you almost need premium if you play for less than 2 hours a week(premium gives much higher money rewards, you'll easily start moving up to different weapons and cars without spending a cent.

Learning curve is steep. Of the dozen or so people I've introduced to this game only one was more than useless for the first few hours of play. I will help

Community is often venomous. Avoid large clans


Hacking is a problem

APB:Reloaded is a double edged sword of a game. At times I've had some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had playing it

Its an awesome game for driving around

It is a TPS

* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The three selected games will be played all next week
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

1320981521.0,m89jh,[ANNOUNCEMENT] | Notes on Giveaways,Jomskylark,23,5,19,"Hey

##READ THIS FIRST

This thread was created last year when there was a sudden influx of giveaways. At one point we had *six* ongoing giveaways! We didn't know exactly what to do

However, most of the content in this thread is obsolete and doesn't really matter.

If you're interested in creating a giveaway of some kind for us, great, if you're clueless but still want to give to the community no worries! We can give you a few suggestions. :)

Alternatively

Thank you! I've kept the remaining post as archive material.

*April 10

---

**To be clear

Now

---

There have been a recent influx of giveaways, especially if you're planning on creating your own giveaway:

* There are currently no special rules regarding giveaway creation. [SteamGifts.com](http://www.steamgifts.com/) seems to be the go-to platform for hosting giveaways, if you want something more exciting, re-brand your giveaway as [CONTEST], and ask participants to do something fun or exciting for a chance to win. Reply with the word ponies if you're actually reading this.

* There is a difference between **exclusive** giveaways and **non-exclusive** giveaways. SteamGifts.com offers the ability to restrict your giveaway to a specific Steam group. If a giveaway is restricted to the Playdate Steam group, but we (mods) will only promote exclusive giveaways.**

*Note: The reason we won't promote giveaways that aren't exclusive to Playdate is partially because then there'd be way too many giveaways to promote

---

**Creating a Giveaway**

* Before creating a giveaway, but the more giveaways going on at one time increases the probability of individual giveaways receiving less exposure. So, consider waiting until a lapse in giveaways to launch yours.

* Additionally

* When creating a giveaway, be sure to include [GIVEAWAY] in brackets so that your thread shows up green!**

* Be sure to include the **exact closing time (day &amp; time &amp; timezone)** of your giveaway

* If you're making an exclusive giveaway, and any special rules. You can send a message to the mods before or after creating your giveaway.

Every other month the native Bitfighter community hosts a spectacular event titled the ""**Big Bitfighter Battle**""

The seventh BBB runs for four hours, but if you want to win a prize, you should stay for a while... wait, a prize?

Yup, head on over to the Bitfighter forums: [**[Link]**](http://bitfighter.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=970)

The best part about the seventh BBB is that it aligns with Bitfighter's focus time. Both events will begin at 8:00 PM EDT. Just log onto Bitfighter and join the exclusive BBB server! Make sure to wear the {R} in your name so we know you're from /r/Playdate.

tl;dr: **Join us for a night of awesome on Friday

Thanks! Be sure to let me know if you have any questions. :)

*IT'S T-T-T-TIME TO VOTE!*

##Planned Timeline

---

* Focus times for Revenge of the Cats: Ethernet on Saturday at 8:00 PM EDT and Mount &amp; Blade: Warband on Sunday at 8:00 PM EDT.
* **Voting closes Sunday at 11 PM EDT! Be sure to check back frequently throughout the voting period for new nominations.**
* Weekly wrap-up goes up late Sunday.
* Games announced on late Monday. Server planning thread and individual discussion threads go up then too.

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below)
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates)
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

The game is class-based, with three classes available, each with slightly different characteristics, abilities, and available weaponry. NEOTOKYO° has two gametypes: team-based deathmatch, in which the team that manages to kill all members of the opposing team wins, though the majority of maps are designed for the latter mode. This gametype has the two teams competing to capture a randomly-spawned objective item, as well as that the Ghost allows the player holding it to see the locations of opposing team members through walls

**FYI:** This will (hopefully) be the last time we follow this outdated system of voting. Starting Monday the new voting system will be officially put into effect. That means starting Monday you will be able to begin nominating games for the next weekend. If you haven't done so already

*IT'S T-T-T-TIME TO VOTE!*

##Planned Timeline

---

* Focus times for Killing Floor on Saturday at 8:00 PM EDT and The Hidden on Sunday at 8:00 PM EDT.
* **Voting closes Sunday at 11 PM EDT! Be sure to check back frequently throughout the voting period for new nominations.**
* Weekly wrap-up goes up late Sunday.
* Games announced on late Monday. Server planning thread and individual discussion threads go up then too.

---

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

---

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below)
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates)
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

Planned Timeline:

* Focus times for Armagetron Advanced and Trine 2 on Saturday and Sunday (each at 8 PM EST)
* **Voting closes Sunday at 9 PM EST**
* Games for the upcoming week announced late Sunday. Server planning thread, and weekly wrap-up go up late Sunday as well.
* Games-of-the-week guide goes up Monday evening.

*Edits made: Expanded bullet point #2 in How This Works section

---

*Read on if you'd like to know...*

##HOW THIS WORKS

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below)
* We will be selecting ~~three~~ two games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of points they receive, low pricing and easy to buy, variety of genres, whether it's been selected recently, etc.
* The ~~three~~ two selected games will be played all next week
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be ~~three~~ dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work. **Note: As only two games are being picked this week, there will be no focus time on Sunday.**

---

*Read on if you want to...*

##NOMINATE A GAME

**Please read and follow the rules below or your nomination WILL be considered invalid.** Failure to follow these rules will result in your nomination being revoked. Should this happen

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer.
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that was played the previous week (these are: Tribes: Ascend
* There should be only one nomination per post.

**The following MUST be included in your nomination post for it to be considered valid!**

* A link to the game's website or download page
* List of supported platforms (specifically Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Price (specifically free or not free)
* A short description of the game (optional but encouraged

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would also be helpful

---

*But wait

##SUPERBOWL

Considering the Superbowl's massive impact

To make up for the lack of a third game, we'll be holding a super awesome contest with fun prizes. A detailed thread will go out later in the week when the date gets closer.

Just can't wait for the party? See if you can find and nominate a football-related game for us to play during the upcoming week!

tl;dr: Two games picked this week instead of three

---

*Get your votes in soon

##Voting will close Sunday

Voting may be extended if this thread does not receive enough participation (nominations and/or votes).

Battlefield 1942 is that classic FPS that started it all for the WWII genre of games. A game such as it had never been seen before with such great characteristics of vehicular gameplay, and is now focused more on fun. If you want a game unlike any others on the market in this period of time BF1942 is the way to go as it offers a little something for everyone.

##CLOSED! DO NOT NOMINATE!

**Note: Please do not comment on nominations** unless it is super important. You will have your chance in the voting thread. :)

**Active Experiments:**

* Playdate Recycling: Nominations from the previous week that weren't selected officially are added automatically to the line-up. Please nominate as you normally would however.
* Easy Nominating: You may skip adding the typical nomination requirements like supported platorms and price etc. **Only the game name is necessary!** You can add the other stuff if you want but it is not essential. Before voting begins a moderator will insert that extra info into nominations so nobody will be at a disadvantage if they choose to leave the info out.

**Nomination Qualifications:**

* The nominated game must have multiplayer capability and must be compatible with the computer. And other common sense that I hope I don't have to list here
* The nominated game cannot be one of the games that is currently being played. You may nominate a game played the previous weekend
* You may nominate up to THREE games per week. You may stack multiple nominations per post.

*We require users to list a few game specifications for their nominations to be considered valid. The reason for this is for the convenience of our users and mods. Writing a short description would be helpful

* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates)
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday. [See this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/mugsv/focus_times_overview_dec_24/c34g2j7?context=1) for more information on how focus times work.

* Nominate the game you'd like to play by posting in this thread (see rules below)
* We will be selecting three games to play. Games will be selected based primarily on the amount of upvotes they receive, a fresh genre, whether it's been selected recently, etc. We always try to pick at least one cross-platform game and at least one free game (or one game that shares both).
* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also
* The three selected games will be played all next week (see thread title for dates)
* During the week, or if another game is better suited for this week (ex. free-to-play weekend). Generally when this happens we will ask for approval from the community.
* There will be three dedicated ""focus times"" (one for each game) to help increase activity in the selected games. Focus Times are specific times set aside to play the chosen games. By playing just a couple of hours during a focus time, and Sunday.

There is a discussion the recently began in steamchat on how to improve Playdate further because although it has come far it is still messy and could use reform.

Some ideas include a website which would require an incentive to bring people in, and a better way to get people to participate in voting or Playdates in general.

Although those are a few ideas it takes the help of many Playdate users besides the few of us in chat currently discussing this.  That's where this thread comes in.

We want to have a Playdatewide discussion on how to make Playdate great and improve it in any way possible so please contribute your ideas or criticism here and help the mods and everyone in general have a better and overall more fun time on r/Playdate.

edit:  Also any possible website names would be appreciated and feel free to join in on the current discussion in steamchat.",,t5_2spg8,True,,default,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Playdate/comments/pkdow/rplaydate_looking_forward/

Unfortunately

At this point

**Option A** -- Postpone Nuclear Dawn as official Game of the Week. This option would guarantee Nuclear Dawn a spot in the week of December 12-18

[Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/download/) (which received the next highest amount of votes) would replace Nuclear Dawn. Xonotic is free and cross-platform

**Option B** -- Do nothing. Those who have bought Nuclear Dawn can play it, as we rarely select games that have been played within the past few weeks.

**Option C** - Get together a team of operatives to go and kidnap the entire Steamworks staff and order them to push the F2P weekend back to when it was normally planned

Thanks to Gwnynzer there's a compiled list of correct bf2142 patches here

It can be hell trying to DL the right 1.51 patch for bf2142 because they haven't bothered updating their own forum which states final release of 1.51 in a thread and it isn't the final release!

**Installation/Troubleshooting Guides:** (Hopefully you won't need these as the setup is pretty simple but..) This guide is helpful although it is outdated as you need 1.51 of bf2142 not 1.50. http://forums.fsmod.com/viewtopic.php?id=9938

This may also be quite useful- http://firststrikemod.wikia.com/wiki/Troubleshooting#First_Troubleshooting_Step

There are other threads in here - http://forums.fsmod.com/viewforum.php?id=21

One of the biggest problems is a visual bug in space maps

If you crash or bug out at launch you probably have the wrong version of 2142 or you need to set your exe to widescreen

* Games have already been nominated
* We will be selecting three games to play.

* We encourage you to comment on a nomination if you have thoughts on that game. Negative comments are fine as long as they're not offensive. Commenting gives us a better perspective on why X game should or shouldn't be selected. Also

1323631668.0,n8p9j,[ANNOUNCEMENT] Regarding Recent Events,Jomskylark,14,4,9,"Hello all

Hope you're having a good weekend! We wanted to briefly inform you of two important issues and our responses: Giveaways and attacks.

---

**GIVEAWAYS**

We [recently revealed](http://redd.it/n0bfn) that we were aware of the complaints surrounding Steam notifications and were prepared to take action to lessen notifications. In that thread

We will continue to allow you awesome people to make giveaways, and possibly promoted elsewhere (such as the Steam chat or in the body of other Steam announcements).

We firmly remain of the opinion that giveaways have a positive impact on this great community. We think that giveaways promote bonding and generosity

**There may be rare exceptions to this rule.*

---

**ATTACKS**

The second thing we wanted to discuss was the environment in the Steam chat and other areas of the community. Playdate is a gaming community

Over the past few months we have received a small number of complaints regarding excessive trolling and the like within the Steam chat and other areas of the community. Now, this is not something that we're just going to say and blow it off. Should an event of this arise, you will be warned and potentially receive a temporary ban. We are not going to tolerate our members being threatened, bullied, or excessively trolled.

Once again, if both parties are joking around and having a good time we'll keep back.

**What to do if you're being attacked:** First ask politely for it to stop, investigate the situation, and take proper action.

If a moderator is doing the attacking then send a message to different moderator and not through mod mail.

---

**tl;dr:** Giveaways will be allowed, threatening, etc. against individuals will not be tolerated and should you be guilty of this, we may take action against you.

That's all we've got for now. Let us know what you think! We're always open for ideas and suggestions.

Have a great weekend

You also show me tons of great games when I look through the game suggestions for the GotW.


As such I'd like to enlist the help of r/playdate! My friends are having a LAN party for my brother next Saturday and I'd like to change it up a bit.

Instead of having the same-old lan party games (which we all love) I'd like to spice it up with some other games. Especially free ones since that way theres no convincing people to buy stuff.

So what would you guys suggest?

**tl;dr- You guys are awesome! What are some good free games for a lan party?**

EDIT:
Info on people/games

We've got 2 gaming rigs
3 other desktops
3 laptops
Either Mac or PC

Games we'd normally play:

Counter-Strike 1.6
Halo Combat Evolved
(normally boils down to those 2)
Half-Life 2 Deathmatch

We've also played TF2 with those who had it (when it was p2p)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.


It's casual

Thanks again for the help guys!

Edit again: We also almost all play LoL already. DotA's on the table

**What you'll need:**

* The Game + expansions (all available within the [Indie Royale bundle](http://www.indieroyale.com/)

* [Mumble](http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php) or [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) (mumble preferred

* Insomnia (or just the ability to be up late!)

* A social personality!

----------------------------

AI War is a fully cooperative large-scale RTS 4X game with a bit of tower defense mixed in for good measure. Some battles within the game will have you pitting thousands upon thousands of your own ships against the AI in battle. It's hard to explain all of the tidbits

The DLC (there are now 5 of them) add a ton to the game, tons of new ships and other assorted goodies. Fortunately, every single thing you need, plus almost every other game by the developer (all of which are cooperative and excellent) are [in the Indie Royale bundle for the next 5 days or so!](http://www.indieroyale.com/)

A little background, Path of Exile, miscellaneous other dungeon crawlers, Minecraft, Terraria, LoL, steam games, and she, as opposed to having someone super familiar with the game coach us through.

We play late-night EST, ideally. It wouldn't have to be an every-night deal, maybe once or twice per week, especially considering each game can pan over several game sessions. You'd of course be welcome to join our little group and play other games with us, as well! Most are free to play, to boot (Rift, Path of Exile

I think that about covers it! If you opt for the bundle, which is also available within the pack.
