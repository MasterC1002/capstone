**echt, natürlich, auf jeden fall**

In my German class, rather they say *echt?*. This might be a regional choice though, cause as far as I know they mean the same thing.

To affirm an answer we learned to say *ja* or *nein.* People here do say ja for yes, so read this like in English), as in ""nay danke."" Of course this isn't proper, but among my friends here and most places I goto (bakeries, stores, etc) people/I always say nay, but in my German class I say nein.

We also learned *natürlich* which means ""of course, why would you think otherwise?"" and *natürlich* is more like ""of course and you know it."" Like, if I asked you something like, ""You drink beer, don't you?"" with a hint of doubt, then you would answer ""doch!"" (of course, why would you even ask that?). If I asked, no problem). Auf jeden Fall is like ""absolutely!""

**billig vs gunstig**

We learned the word *billig* in class for ""cheap"", whereas gunstig is cheap as in price-wise.

das billige Auto = that cheap (piece of shit) car
das gunstige Auto = that nicely priced car

Every time you want to say billig

**scheiß**

One of the first days here I was talking to my roommate and said something like ""… scheißes Auto …"" and they laughed a bit, but then again you would probably never use scheiß in any formal or educational setting.

I probably missed a lot but I have no go now. Please add your own!

edit 1: **Freund/Freundin**

I don't remember *ever* learning in my German classes in the US that these words are actually used to mean boyfriend/girlfriend

sie ist *meine* Freundin = she is my girlfriend

sie ist *eine* Freundin = she is a/my (girl) friend

I guess this could lead to some funny situations but if you mess up it's not a big deal

edit 2: **gleichfalls**

Gleichfalls means ""same to you, and I'm not sure if we're speaking with *du* or with *Sie*. Just smile and say ""danke, gleichfalls"" and everything is fine (rather than *dir/Ihnen auch*).

On a related note

**ich bin dabei**

""Hey
""Ja cool

**alles klar?**

I learned *wie geht's* like probably everybody else

**stimmt so**

When people tip here they usually just round the change up

**hä?**

huh --&gt; hä

And, seem to think that you won't get to use your German if you move to Germany.  That is just crazy.  The only way this is true is if you don't try.

Not only did I use my German

My experiences: Nightmarish customer service from T-Mobile

In Würzburg I was invited out on a bachelorette / hen party because I started talking to all the drunk girls running around my hostel.  I spent the entire night at dinner talking German with them.  Then the bride starting puking in the bathroom.  Their English wasn't anywhere as good as my German

In my hostel in Berlin

The same was true everywhere in Eastern Germany.  In Leipzig

It's also not just true for East Germany, greatly outnumbered the people I spoke English with.  And guess what?  They really appreciate it if you speak German, I met a ton of great fun, people.  The Germans really do know a thing or two about the Gemütlichkeit.  

Moreover

And, German is the second most common second language after English.  I had hostelmates from Slovakia and Hungary and they couldn't speak a lick of English, but were pretty good at German.  We also met the owner of our hotel in Bulgaria, her English was terrible, but her German was great.  People are learning German!

We all got to where we are by putting in some hard work memorizing verb forms, and genitive cases, and the gender of each and every noun we wrote down. It took a while to understand some things like separable prefix verbs, prepositional phrases, and Konjunktiv II.

As a contributor of this subreddit

Students: I encourage you to try and push your understanding of the German language to the next level. Try and use a pronoun or preposition you don't quite understand. Try to turn a verb into a noun. Take a guess as to the ending of the adjective, we'll be there to help. But please don't ask us to do your work for you. It hurts your academic performance, and you really won't learn anything.

I have created an app for Android phones as a hobby and I thought some people on this forum might be interested in it. It is a completely free hobby project of mine and I would love some people to see if they can get some use out of it.

The app collects news from German (and English) news sites. You can then read the news in German (or English) and if you don't know a word you tap on it to obtain a translation (in German or English). You can also read Wikipedia and Wiktionary articles on that word for more information.

I made it while living in Germany as an ex-pat and I wanted to read the news that the Germans were reading.

It uses the FreeDict dictionaries for translating

I hope some people use it and it helps them improve their German! Could definitely be used by Germans looking to improve their English as well:)

The app is called Newsfluss and you can get it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limnoski.newsfluss&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd

A very easy way to remember the 2 way prepositions and their meaning is to say them to the tune of Iron Man by Black Sabbath. And with each one there is a hand gesture to follow it. Having went through the motions during one class period almost 5 years ago I have not forgotten them. Make a fist with one hand and position the other hand accordingly:

*An- Make another fist next to the first

*Auf- Place you free hand on top of your fist

*Hinter- Place you hand behind the fist so that it is between the fist and your body

*In- Wrap the fist hand around your other hand

*Neben- place your hand on the side/next to the fist

*Uber- hover your free hand over the fist

*Unter - hover your free hand under the fist

*Vor- hover the free hand in front of the fist so that your fist is separating your body and your free hand.

*Zwischen- Beat your free hand back and forth between your bosy and your fist.

*Wunderbar. Können wir jetzt anfangen?*

English is one of the stranger languages to ever exist. A third of its words have come from Latin

*Wichtig - Weighty - Important.*

Wichtige Wörter are important. It comes down to being able to build sentences and have conversations with the most popular words out there. These include the equivalents of 'you' and 'I', the ending will change in some form or another. I suggest you don't worry about that, and don't let that scare you off.

*Du - Thou - You.*

Du must know which words are wichtig. Ich mean that we should be able to bend the English language every now and then and start to learn German by just guessing. Don't be afraid to type a random sentence in the comment box at this point

*Dein - Thine - Your.*

Look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou#Comparison) Tabelle. Du siehst that there's many similarities between Ye Olde English and German. However

...

*Das ist gut - That is good.*

All in all, would be even longer in English. In order, it's Danube-steam-ship-drive-society-ship-captain. In a nutshell, the only words you don't know are Fahrt, which survives in the English word 'fare' with the meaning 'going' or 'travelling'. Gesell, which means companion and dampf, which survives, as 'damp'.

In a nutshell, not knowing what a downhill run would be called in English and to keep it as short as possible.

The best thing you can also do is to immerse yourself. I received a C in English back when I lived in Austria. By the time I finished my first term in Australia

Today in my research group we were discussing the topic of finding a post-doc after completing your Ph.D.  It was mentioned that it would be inappropriate to ask if the applicant is married or has kids in the US

And then I thought - sure, there are lots of ways to discuss your partner without making it obvious that the partner is a man, for example ""spouse"", ""partner"", or, in less formal conversations, using ""they"" and ""them"": ""Yeah, they're great! I'm looking forward to seeing them again!"".

This book does not have example sentences for every word (it does have some sentences/phrases), so it should be easier in a sense, but it does have a lot more words obviously. Again, I can use my hard copy to correct the errors from copying from the PDF. Obviously this one would be a bit more ambitious, so I would say lets wait until we have the other one finished before tackling this one.

So one of the phrases (amongst many strange ones about people 'playing on the right' that seemed to make no sense either) that came up was to translate 'Achtung

And I was looking at the translations Duolingo itself gave me which were 'careful', like you'd say 'CAREFUL!' to someone who was going to get some unanticipated consequence to their action.

I was thinking, what would be the circumstance?  Would they have done something to me?  Would I be warning them?  Refusing them?  I chose to translate it as 'Attention, no!' and Duolingo duly marked me correct.  I guess I am, without context.  However I am sitting here thinking I have never said 'Attention, no!' and likely never will.  I don't think I've heard people say 'Attention!' outside of films that portray the military.

So amongst those who have a good feel for the language and where it is spoken, in normal life today?

Lieber guter Weihnachtsmann

jetzt ist's soweit
Mein Chef ist nämlich Rechtsanwalt.
Der klagt dich an

Schon seit vielen hundert Jahren
bist du nun durch's Land gefahren
ohne Nummernschild und Licht
auch TÜV und ASU gab es nicht.

Dein Schlitten eignet sich nur schwer
zur Teilnahme am Luftverkehr.
Es wird vor Gericht zu klären sein:
Besitzt du 'nen Pilotenschein?

Durch den Kamin ins Haus zu kommen
ist rein rechtlich strenggenommen
Hausfriedensbruch - Einbruch sogar
das gibt Gefängnis

Und stiehlst du nicht bei den Besuchen
von fremden Tellern Obst und Kuchen?
Das wird bestraft
die Polizei lässt nach dir fahnden.

Es ist auch allgemein bekannt
du kommst gar nicht aus diesem Land.
Wie man so hört
am Nordpol
als kommst du nicht aus der EU
das kommt zur Klageschrift dazu!

Hier kommt das Arbeitsrecht zum Tragen
ein jeder Richter wird sich fragen
ob deine Arbeit rechtens ist
weil du ohne Erlaubnis bist.

Der Engel
ist minderjährig und bereitet
uns daher wirklich Kopfzerbrechen
das Jugendamt will mit dir sprechen!

Jetzt kommen wir zu ernsten Sachen
wir finden es gar nicht zum Lachen
dass Kindern du mit Schläge drohst
darüber ist mein Chef erbost.

Nötigung heisst das Vergehen
und wird bestraft
mit Freiheitsentzug von ein paar Jahren
aus ist's bald mit dem Schlitten fahren.

Das Handwerk ist dir bald gelegt
es sei denn dieser Brief bewegt

z.B.: When would one say ""sehr gut"" rather than ""ganz gut"" ?

1355090938.0,14kg5f,German WWII reenactor looking for help with military phrases,SeldomSeven,18,5,26,"Guten Tag meine Damen und Herren! 

I'm a member of a living-history/reenacting group that portrays German soldiers from WWII. Obviously there are a lot of mixed feelings about that sort of thing out there, but rather a fairly normal human being with similar values to any solider. I believe recognizing that it doesn't take a monster to do monstrous things is a very important lesson to remember if we want to prevent something like the atrocities of WWII from ever happening again. 

But that aside, but I want to see what other people come up with to see whether I'm on the right track. Again, imagine that you're a solider when translating these; a stressed-out solider wouldn't say ""I am reloading my rifle!"" in combat, but rather something like ""Reloading!!"" I'm just not sure how a native German speaker would abbreviate such expressions. Anyways, here are the phrases:

(I am) Reloading!

Get in position! 

Stay in position! 

Stay in a firing line! (Schützenkette is the word I've found for firing line)

Don't move or I'll shoot! 

Advance 300 meters!

Advance behind the tank 300 meters! 

Advance to the treeline! 

Retreat! 

Don't give up! / Never surrender!  

We surrender! 

Range: 500 meters (artillery command)

Fire for effect! (artillery command)

Soup's on! (or some other idiom for: ""It's time to eat"")

Keep an eye on that ridge-line! (ridge-line / berm / small hill / knoll)

Look over there!    *

Keep your head down! 

Take cover!

(other phrases such as jeers towards the enemy

    *I am aware that ""schau mal da drüben!"" would probably work. 
    But this brings up a question of mine: 
    What's the difference between ""Schauen"" and ""Sehen""?

**Vocabulary:**

[Langenscheidt's Grundwortschatz](http://www.amazon.com/Basic-German-Vocabulary-Langenscheidt-Bock/dp/3468494009/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1): A nice some 4

**General Comprehension:**

I've heard good things about this but don't own it.  What do other people think?

[1001 Pitfalls in German](http://www.amazon.com/1001-Pitfalls-German-Henry-Strutz/dp/0812096525).
It covers quite a bit of grammar aspects and better clarifications that I havent seen elsewhere without supersupertechnical jargon (I mean it's still technical but not say as heavy as Hammers). It's a little old but it's still darn good.

**Grammar:**

[Harrap's Pocket German Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/Harraps-Pocket-German-Grammar-language/dp/0071636234): It's a small book with a lot of information and examples. It's given me answers to most of my questions and when it doesn't have an answer I need

[Klipp und Klar Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/Klipp-Und-Klar-Ubungsgrammatik-Grundstufe/dp/3126753280/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332806978&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0).  Covers all grammar

**Colloquial German:**

[Dirty German.](http://www.amazon.com/Dirty-German-Everyday-Slang-Whats/dp/1569756732): Regional slang phrase book!  A bit ridiculous and probably a bit off but has a lot of information in different categories.

**Courses / Learning Systems:**

[Assimil German With Ease](http://www.amazon.com/German-Ease-Assimil-Method-Books/dp/270051050X):  This is the course that really got me going.  It's horribly translated and light on the Grammar

[Assimil German Without Toil](http://www.amazon.com/German-Without-Toil-A-Cherel/dp/2700500067/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332721607&amp;sr=1-1): The older version of the With Ease course.  It's much much much better translated and it has more vocabulary

[FSI German Course](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-German-15-Compact-Discs/dp/0812078691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332721705&amp;sr=1-1): Old as hell and full of typos.  This will basically drill grammar into your brain.  Which is what it's good for.  Sloppy audio recordings get annoying and it's hard to keep yourself awake (also the course is horribly outdated because it's some 50 years old)

[The Michel Thomas Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Thomas_Method): A nice linguistic approach to building a solid foundation in German.  I have done the advanced course and Thomas gives you a bunch of nice information to dissect and recognize things in the German language.  Might need some extra grammar with this!

1258989017.0,a7aon,DC's first lesson: (Beginner) Genders of Nouns,DCMurphy,11,0,13,"First of all, and I'm also involved in a business program in the Uni.

The German language, it is just memorization, but there are a few tricks that you can employ.

The gender is so important because German uses a declension system. The Accusative, and Genitive cases help to explain the function of the noun in the sentence. Nouns are easily identified because they are always capitalized, regardless of place in the sentence. The Genitive case is a little more advanced, so we will not be exploring that in this lesson.

First we'll start with definite articles.

Der - the masculine. The pronoun that goes with this is ""er"", der Fahrer (the doctor, the pharmacist, the driver).

Die - the feminine. The pronoun that goes with this is ""sie"", die Apothekerin (the female nurse, the female teacher, the female pharmacist). Plural versions of nouns are also always feminine. We will cover the plural in a different lesson.

Most occupations have both male and female forms that are similar. Simply add -in to the end of it to make it female. A notable exception is a nurse. Masculine: Krankenpfleger. Feminine: Krankenschwester.

Das - the neutral. The pronoun associated with this is ""es"", ""a"", or ""u"". das Mädchen, for example, is a small girl.

So, das"", or the three ways to say ""the"". Next it's time to look at ""ein"" and ""eine"", of the indefinite articles, commonly known in English as ""a/an"".

Ein is used for Der and Das. Eine is used for Die. Simply enough

Das Fahrrad ist kaputt. *The bike is broken*

Ein Zug kommt gleich. *A train comes soon*

Ein Löwe frisst den Hund. *A lion devours the dog*

You may be looking at that last example and say ""den? We never heard of a den! What kind of crap is this!""

This is the Accusative (Akkusativ) case. It is used with some prepositions but always indicates the direct object. When the noun in question is a Direct Object, right?

Now the Dativ case is used with other prepositions

In the Dativ

So

Nominativ &gt; Akkusativ &gt; Dativ

Der (ein) ------- Den (einen) -------- Dem (einem)

Die (eine) ------- Die (eine) -------- Der (einer)

Das (ein) ------- Das (ein) -------- Dem (einem)

That's all for now,False,,t5_2rd5y,True,,,t3_a7aon
1258962001.0,a76tz,[Q] Lesson 3: First sentences,quink,12,0,12,"A sentence has two elements. A subject and a verb. 

*I am. Ich bin.*

*Du bist. You are.*

*Es ist. It is.*

Es ist ein Erdferkel. It is an aardvark. You may wonder at the similarity between the hardly English word 'aardvark' and the German word 'Erdferkel'. Well, halfway between German and English. But the distinction cannot necessarily be made that lightly. English came from an island. The linguistic influence that this tiny poor country of a few million had before the 1500s was negligible and it was only ever a subject of linguistic changes from outside or inside, never inflicting them onto others. English is what it is today because it became a simple language that simplified yet became more idiosyncratic in isolation. Pronounciation went up on the weird scale, instead we don't have to worry about complicated conjugations or declensions.

*Huzzah! Oh

Was will ich? Was willst du? Was will es?

All of these are simpler

*'Du bist etwas.'*

'Etwas' just means 'something'. Despite the way it looks, next we come to:

'Willst du etwas?'

So, Verb and then Object. So, we've got a statement. Ich mag. I like. That, by itself, doesn't mean much now, right?

*I like. Ich mag*

Who or what do I like, one might say 'I like you'. In old English, however one doesn't say 'I like thou', one says 'I like thee'. The 'you' used to change back in the past. Thus you can say something like 'Thee I like' without worrying that you've jumbled up the order. If you'd say 'You, I like' you'd say the same thing as well, but not without that comma, otherwise 'You I like' doesn't make much sense. 

*[Ich mag dich](http://images.google.com.au/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=ich%20mag%20dich&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi)*

How would you inquire about whom you like? Or should that be who? I don't even know. And here, also the same thing as objective. Usually. Ugh.

*[Declensions have disappeared in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Declension_in_English&amp;redirect=no)*

Apart from pronouns and the increasingly selten 'whom', somewhat idiosyncratic, but I hope you'll see the point. Let's just provide a direct translation in the interim.

[Whom and Who? are Wem and Wen?](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wen#German). But in a very complicated fashion.

Wen mag ich? Dich mag ich. Mag ich dich sehr (very)? Ja

*[J'accuse...!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%27accuse_%28letter%29)*

Where does the etymological trail lead? [Sculan](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sculan). Be-shall-ing. Accusing. Beschuldigen.

The most ridiculous thing about this whole 'ch' thing is that it's not supposed to be pronounced like your throat has just given rise to a rebellion of your larynx. Unless you're speaking Swiss German or Russian

*[Die Bart

'ie' is the same as one would pronounce 'ee'. Dee Bart dee

*[Neunundneunzig Luftballons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQYQTFudrqc)*

Have you some time for me, meaning 'nine'. Which is a homonym of the German word 'nein', meaning 'no'. As the old saying goes: 'Nein!!!!!'.

The consonants don't really ever change. So

*Why? Well

Keep the sound 'o' in your mouth, and you've got the right to do so. It's the same sound as an 'er' pronounced in the very front of your mouth. 

*[A clip about the Ä](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSw9ilEE8r4#t=0m15s)*

Next, 'ay', 'oh' and 'you' in order without moving your chin. Those are the vowels as pronounced in English. It's fairly impossible.

Now say 'ah', 'oh' and 'oo'. If you can do it without moving your chin you've probably done it right.

*Probably.*

Having words that look the same as they're pronounced is a concept not really found in English. You'll find it in languages like Italian and Russian, where there's still a huge overlap. Then there's English the irregular poster-child, going on its way to something like Chinese, where the shape of a word bear hardly about a clue about its pronounciation. Surely you should want to prefer something easy, right?

The pronounciation similarities can be misleading at times. Sometimes you'll know a word in German and English. A word like butter

So, taking a linguistic stab, surely the Spanish word for butter would have been something along the lines of 'butar'. This, of course, he said to a waitress. As some of you may know, the very similar word 'puta' has another meaning in Spanish. The Spanish word for butter is 'mantequilla'.

 * **ch** before **s** (except when it is in the superlative suffix -ste[n]) = **k**; also in words of Greek origin

I have check in but for some reason Duolingo dipolar about the meaning of sich anmelden and sometimes it can only be translated at to log in or sign in.

I can only speak from experience as a native speaker but it feels like this has died out almost completely in everyday use of the language.

1260632717.0,ady2l,DC's Second Lesson: Verb conjugation in the present,DCMurphy,9,1,4,"Hello all

First we'll review our cases/subjects in the nominative. In **BOLD** are German

**ich** == ""I"" - 1st person singular

**du** == ""You"" - 2nd person singular (informal)

**er** &amp;&amp;== ""Him"" - masculine 3rd person singular

**sie** &amp;&amp;== ""She"" - feminine 3rd person singular

**es** &amp;&amp;== ""it"" - neuter 3rd person singular

&amp;&amp; - er/sie/es are all conjugated the same way

**wir** == ""We"" - 1st person plural

**ihr** == ""You""/""Y'all"" - 2nd person plural

**sie**%% == ""They"" - 3rd person plural for all genders

**Sie**%% == ""You"" - 2nd person singular (formal)

%% - Sie and sie are conjugated the same way. The 2nd person formal ""Sie"" is always capitalized in a sentence

_____________

Now that that's straight

- komm|en (to come)
- kauf|en (to buy)
- geh|en (to go) ^^

^^ note that gehen is only regular in the present.

In the case of verb conjugation, ""lauf"", and ""kauf"". Some verbs such as entwickeln (to develop) and klingeln (to ring) do not have the -en ending. In this case, simply drop the -n to find your root.

So

ich = -e (komme

du = -st (kommst

er/sie/es = -t (kommt

wir = -en (kommen

ihr = -t (same as er/sie/es)

sie/Sie = -en (same as infinitive and wir)

___________

The endings of these verbs are especially important because they help distinguish who is doing the action, so that isn't of concern right now. In the next lesson, we'll cover the simple past and review using direct/indirect objects and the declension system to form more complex sentences.

Until then

* ""*Your hiding* is futile. We will find you and you will be assimilated.""
* ""*My burning of the orphanage* was a reprehensible action and I apologize for it.""
* ""In Shakespeare's Hamlet

I think that I've seen the first type used a bit before in German, I think that it'd be pretty much the same in German, consisting of the infinitive of the verb. For my reasoning, consider that in English the verbs in these constructions can often be replaced with a matching noun (and in some cases it sounds awkward if one doesn't). E.g. ""The mayor's senseless destruction of city greenspace"" v.s. ""the mayor's senseless destroying of city greenspace."" However, I'm not sure of this, and I'm curious about how other elements would be added to the verb in German. Does it work like any old subordinate clause? I.e does ""Dein zu schnell dein Rad fahren ärgert mich so viel."" make sense? (Your to-fast-riding of your bike is annoying me) Yes, I know that this example sounds awkward

So yeah

Here's the fable:
  
Vor langer Zeit in einem kleinen Dorf lebte ein Junge. Sein Name war Hans. Sie lebten mit seiner Mutter. Er sagte ihr:
- Mutter
Mutter glaubte ihn nicht
- Du sollst nicht lügen
- Ich lüge nicht. Ich sage die Wahrheit! – sagte Hans. Sie hörte nicht zu und kam nach Hause zurück.
Ein paar Tage später Hans noch einmal sagte seine Mutter:
- Mutter, aber sie sing mit ihm in den Wald. Sie sahen kein Einhorn.
 - Ich habe dir gesehen– do sollst nicht lügen! Ich will nicht ging mit dir in den Wald nächste Mal – du bist nicht vertrauenswürdig!
- Ich lüge nicht! Ich schwöre! Ich habe ein Einhorn gesehen! Noch einmal
Kurz danach
 - Ich habe mich verloren. Kannst du mir die Einweg anzeigen?
Das Einhorn bejahte und sie folgte es und es führte sie nach Hause. Ihr Sohn wartete für sie. Sie weinte und sagte
- Entschuldigung mein Sohne

Leider
Tom und Anna trennten sich. Sie wollte sich scheiden lassen

Wolf's perspective on red riding hood:
  
Ich habe Rotkäppchen in dem Wald getroffen. Ich habe sie gefragt, dass sie kann Blumen in den Wald suchen und ich kann  ihre Oma essen! Ich habe gesagt „willst du deiner Oma nicht Blumen mitbringen?“ Sie hat geantwortet: „Eine gute Idee!“ und ist gelaufen in den Wald. Ich bin zum Haus der Oma gegangen, habe die Tür geöffnet  und ich habe die Oma gefressen. Ich habe ihren Kleidung angezogen ich bin ins Bett gelegen. Wenn ich war ins Bett gelegen, Rotkäppchen bekommen ist. Wenn es war über meinen lange Ohren und großen Mund gewundert, ich habe es gefressen! Ich habe in das Bett gelegen,  geschlafen und laut geschnarrt. Ich habe plötzlich aufgestanden, weil der Jager hat meinen Bauch mit einem Messer ausgeschnitten! Die Oma und das Rotkäppchen sind heraus gesprungen und ich habe das Bewusstsein verloren. Ich habe in dem Krankenhaus aufgestanden.

* auch betont, warum etwas der Fall ist (oder ist es nicht). ""Günther sieht heute schlecht aus."" ""Er ist ja auch lange krank gewesen"". ""Das hättest du nicht tun sollen"" ""Ich habe es ja auch nicht getan""

* Laut anderen Quellen ""The sense is not so much of an additional point as of a rejoinder that matches and fulfils an expectation implicit in the prompt"".
