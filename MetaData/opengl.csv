1338140142.0,u7h3p,Feedback on an OpenGL guide I'm working on,Overv,41,7,39,"Hi

I'm currently working on yet another OpenGL guide

- Coverage of modern topics like geometry shaders and feedback buffers
- Choice of libraries to use instead of forcing one (e.g. GLUT)
- Emphasis on real world uses of features (by developing a voxel world renderer throughout the tutorial series)
- Providing exercises to get the reader involved and to build up a real understanding
- Everyone can submit improvements
- On-site feedback and help

My aim is really to make it fun for people new to OpenGL to learn how to use it in a non-deprecated way. I try to do this by showing the possibilities and how to apply them by working on a real project (a voxel world renderer like Minecraft). Things that I consider important and other guides don't go over are loading textures from files and loading models. If people get stuck

To ensure that these goals are met

The tutorials in the sidebar were all created as a response to the lack of modern OpenGL tutorials and they are indeed excellently written by people who know what they're talking about.

There is however one problem. The beginners still aren't reading them

What can we do to change this? Instead of telling them how bad it is to learn old OpenGL or how much fancier VBOs are

All current guides follow the same model: learn one new feature at a time and sometimes they even tell you how it will help you make your graphics that much better.

What if there would be a guide where the reader actually makes something throughout the chapters? You start with the basics, ssao post-processing, octree optimization, depth sorting, etc.

Think of how much more appealing OpenGL if you are taught how to make your own Minecraft inspired game

The shader itself is still more of a test case but here's what I've started out with.

**Vertex Shader 1.0**  
    #version 150 core
    
    //Input data
    in vec3 position;
    in vec2 texcoord;
    in vec3 color;
    in vec3 normal;
    
    //Output data
    out vec3 Color;
    out vec2 Texcoord;
    out vec3 Normal;
    out vec3 fragVert;
    out vec4 Position;
    
    //Information
    uniform mat4 model;
    uniform mat4 view;
    uniform mat4 proj;
    
    void main() 
    {
    	Color = color;
    	Texcoord = texcoord;
    	Normal = normal;
    	
    	fragVert = position;
    
    	gl_Position = proj * view * model * vec4( position.x, 1.0 );
    	Position = gl_Position;
    }    

**Fragment shader 1.0**  
    #version 150 core
    
    //Input
    in vec3 Color;
    in vec2 Texcoord;
    in vec3 Normal;
    uniform sampler2D tex;
    
    uniform float hasTexture;
    uniform float calculateLight;
    
    in vec3 fragVert;
    
    in vec4 Position;
    
    //Light
    uniform struct Light {
       vec3 position;
       vec3 color;
    } light;
    
    //Output
    out vec4 outColor;
    
    //Information
    uniform mat4 model;
    uniform mat4 view;
    uniform mat4 proj;
    
    
    void main()
    {
    	if(calculateLight==1.0f)
    	{
    		
    		mat3 normalMatrix = transpose(inverse(mat3(model))) ;
    		vec3 normal = normalize(normalMatrix * Normal);
    		
    		//calculate the location of this fragment (pixel) in world coordinates
    		vec3 fragPosition = vec3(model * view * vec4(fragVert
    		
    		//calculate the vector from this pixels surface to the light source
    		vec3 surfaceToLight = light.position - fragPosition;
    
    		//calculate the cosine of the angle of incidence (brightness)
    		float brightness = dot(normal
    		brightness = clamp(brightness
    	
    		if(hasTexture==0.0)
    		{
    			outColor = brightness * vec4(light.color
    		}
    		else
    		{
    			outColor = brightness * vec4(light.color, Texcoord);
    		}
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		if(hasTexture==0.0)
    		{
    			outColor = vec4(Color
    		}
    		else
    		{
    			outColor = vec4(Color
    		}
    	}
    }


These two shaders working together took my test case down to 11 FPS. By moving over multiple parts of the lighting calculation to the Vertex shader I got it back up to 35 FPS at which the test case started (a 320% increase in speed).

**System/Code Info**  
My code was written in C++ for OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile on a AMD Readon HD 6770m GPU on a Macbook Pro.


What this method comes down to is the fact that a fragment shader works on a per pixel basis but might need information that's always the same for every pixel for that Vertex. By having the Vertex shader take care of that you take the amount of calculations down by a massive amount and thus get a massive performance gain.

Also GLSL links the outputs from a Vertex Shader directly to the inputs on a Fragment shader so you won't have to make any changes to your code base in order to allow these shaders to work (at least for this version of GLSL which is 1.50)",,t5_2qzvf,1375007865.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1j7kpv/a_quick_glsl_tip_for_a_potentially_massive_speed/

1323846615.0,nc55x,VBO Multi Threading Question,refD,20,2,5,"I currently have two threads set up:

1. Main Rendering Thread

2. Geometry generation thread

The second thread has it's own context that is shared with the first (share lists etc.).

For each piece of geometry it generates

     glGenBuffers();
     glBindBuffer(n);
     glBufferData(...);
     glBindBuffer(0);

And passes the VBO id through to the main thread for rendering

    glBindBuffer(n);
    /* draw commands */

I incorrectly assumed that this would be ok. As the glBufferData command must block the current thread until the data has been uploaded I figured that would mean the VBO would be ready to go as soon as the command finishes.

I get occsional graphical flickering/garbage though (as if it's drawing partially garbage data). When I insert a glFlush() in to the background thread (before it hands over the VBO id), so does performance.

Is there an easy way to ensure a VBO is ready before handing it off? I took a quick look at sync objects in OGL4.2

Edit: 

I'm partially retarded, though I'm not yet sure of the performance implications of the glGetSync.

I've added a glFenceSync() call by the background thread which passes the sync object to the foreground thread

Approximately 95% of updates from the background thread are ready immediately (upon the first call to get)

Now if only I could work out why my initial glBufferData() and post-orphan glBufferSubData() calls are giving me such unpredictable performance (sub millisecond up to 60ms).

My buffer calls are slow because I'm consuming 90% of my video card's RAM

* Use the modern
* My laptop runs on an Intel card, what the f*ck painful. Apparently the lowest common denominator for modern OpenGL is OpenGL 2.1, WebGL, and OpenGL ES. In OGL 2.1, I can replace ""in"" with ""attribute"" and ""out"" with ""varying"". WebGL has the benefit of having a uniform API across every OS, but the learning resources suck.

So I still have some burning questions:

1. **What can I do with OpenGL?** If I want to make a game
Sidenote for myself: there's Cinder/openFrameWorks/Processing for loads of ""pretty picture"" software.
2. **What are shaders for
3. **What's the definitive starting book for computer graphics?** I'm going through Interactive Computer Graphics at the moment, I guess nothing beats the OpenGL.org website/wiki/sidebar tutorials.
4. **Where do graphics programmers hang out?** Python programmers hang out in /r/Python[1] , and I don't really get the ecosystem. Is there some secret forum on the interwebs somewhere? I've heard of this thing called the demoscene, but it seems like everyone in it lives in Europe (I'm in the U.S.).

The engine user can set up as many of those mesh buffers as they please

Looking at a real-world complete model such as sponza.obj using the AssImp viewer

**1.6 MB ""index buffers""

Now the mesh buffers already utilize internally VAOs for minimizing certain GL calls (the bind-buffer and ""enable vertex attrib pointer"" stuff). Next, but alas) -- chances are that a mesh such as Sponza is going to exceed a single mesh buffer and is to be spread across multiple such MBs, necessitating more bindvertexarray calls per pass.

Would it be most reasonable to decompose all meshes into their individual faces and sort those into individual VBO/IBO/VAO buckets based on their material? Or would it be just as good (or bad) as filling up the ""mesh buffers"" sequentially and continuing into the next one when the current one is ""full"". However

Right now, of course neither the GPU nor the GL really cares about what the designer declared an ""object"" or a ""model"", only about triangles to be rasterized.)

I add lights as fullscreen/globes/cones in a second light fbo

* First question would be if im i doing anything wrong here? Next step is to add shadows to the scene
 

* VBOs - Do i put all my vertices in one big VBO or do i create one for each object/model? My objects will rotate, CPU/client side data or in bound buffers only?

* Drawing multiple cubes (for example) should i use instanced drawing of multiple identical (except rotation/translation/scale) or add vertex-data for each of them via VBO? 

* FBOs - Should i use many FBOs and switch between them or switch the texture target it renders to and recycle the FBO? is there a cut off or max number of FBOs you can use?

* Is there a standard way to get a list or names of the variable inputs  defined in a shader? My application will accept user inputed shaders for post process stage and i want to find out what variables they want to use so i can hook them up

From the best I can see, wouldn't all VBOs within a VAO need to use the same vertex format?  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I can imagine it being an annoyance in certain situations.

The other definition of VAO I've found stated it as a grouping of VBOs.  This would match with my theory that each buffer than gets bound would belong to the last VAO that was bound.  If so

I render diffuse + normals + specular passes to a framebuffer; and also store the depth into a texture.


The normals are converted from tangent space to normalized device coordinates using 



N = projectionMatrix\*TBNMatrix\*normalMapSample;



The deferred shading shader reconstructs the 3D geometry within the normalized device coordinate (NDC) cube in the following way:



x = texCoord.x \* 2 - 1;


y = texCoord.y \* 2 - 1;


z = linearizedDepth \* 2 - 1;

I pass in the light position in NDC calculating it in the following way:

L = projectionMatrix * lightPosition;



L = L/L.w; 


(oddly enough,0,1] gives me a w coordinate of 0 making my NDC coordinates garbage)


This light position and the normals/reconstructed points are used to calculate lighting.


I suspect that either my normals or my light position conversion are incorrect

This might sound like a really dumb question, felt the pain. I'm just wondering about the code necessary to take a stream of verts, triangles and textures (and texture coordinates) plus some light information, and render all that to the screen in realtime in a reasonably up-to-date and visually pleasing way. 

Specifically

* Per-pixel lighting - ideally from an arbitrary number of light sources.
* Hard and soft shadows in realtime (no baked textures or lightmaps!)
* Normal maps
* Diffuse
* Ambient occlusion (SSAO will be fine
* Color bleed or some other simple(ish) global illumination fake. 
* Bokeh depth of field (that doesn't look godawful)
* Antialiasing (any AA technique is fine)
* Volumetric fog would be lovely too :) 
* Nvidia only. I don't care about ATI as I'll be using an NVidia card. 

The specific project I'm considering (and hiring for, which has recently introduced its [Custom Renderer API](http://docs.autodesk.com/MB/2014/ENU/MotionBuilder-SDK-Documentation/index.html). They say that API should make it reasonably easy to plug an entire new rendering engine into the program, and that's what I plan to do!

Unfortunately

So, a few dozen, a few hundred, a few thousand, or ""oh god, don't ask""?

I'm working on setting up a deferred rendering engine, all the opengl calls work about the same.

I've been able to find plenty of resources on setting up the FBO, and I'm virtually 100% certain that I've not made any errors so far. As for using the FBOs, I've not seen any examples which are compatible with what I'm doing (most use older extensions, others use newer glsl versions) and I'm not finding anything relevant when I try and dig through the documentation. If anybody knows of an example, that would be really helpful, as I've gotten through so far mostly on copying examples and looking up calls that I don't know.

Right now this is essentially what I'm doing;

Creating the FBO:
Generating a FrameBuffer
Binding the Framebuffer
Binding and initializing each texture
Binding the renderbuffer
(at this point no opengl errors


Rendering:
Bind the FBO
Draw to it with a test shader
Unbind the FBO
Draw the textures from the FrameBuffer on a screen sized quad with a different shader which combines the channels

What I get:
Black

Right now I've sort of ended up with my own non-working method which I got out of spending an entire weekend confused/frustrated

In the first shader program (the fragment shader should render two two channels)
I've declared two outs, but I read that the gl_FragData[i] was deprecated and it wasn't working. Right now they aren't bound to anything.

In the second shader program (which just draws to the screen)
I've just got two samplers. I sample each texture and combine them. When I modify this to include an outline

Sadly, which doesn't support opengl3+.

I'm working on pulling out the rendering code from my project so I can show the relevant parts to people, though it's not something I'm proud of)

Also, although I'm somewhat time constrained, so I can't promise I'll look into things soon unless they're really necessary.

I apologize if this is too much information off the bat

TL;DR How do you hook up a shader program and fbo with multiple color attachments so you can just specify the color of each pixel for each attachment texture in the frag shader. (in opengl 3.2/glsl150)

EDIT: 
I've finally figured it out! The main/really stupid error was that I wasn't flipping my input buffer before calling glDrawBuffers() (In Java

If you do have a WebGL enabled browser you can check out the [live demo](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/texture/reddit.html) If you want to mess around with it yourself just drop the below code into an HTML file.

The Khronos wiki has [instructions](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation) for getting a WebGL enabled browser.

For those unable to get a WebGL enabled browser

This demo uses my own [WebGLU](http://github.com/onegeek/webglu) library for working with [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page). (My poster submission to SIGGRAPH of this library was accepted a few days ago w00t!) I've got some (mediocre) [documentaton](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/doc/) up as well as some [examples](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/examples/ ""Just view source on each demo page"")  

 The [fragment](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.frag) and [vertex](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~bpd9116/WebGLU/shaders/texphong.vert) shaders used in the demo are also available if you want to poke at them.

`$W` is used to access WebGLU within the script.

First of all, not deprecated old opengl. If using glMatrixMode is NOT deprecated, then why would you not want to use that instead? Wouldn't it be much easier than having to create tons of vertex shaders for every different kind of object or something you want to make?

Secondly, the matrix is stored in column-major order. So array index 14 is in the third row of the fourth column."" If it's in column-major order, and we're talking about index 14, how is it in the third row of the fourth column? Shouldn't that be second row and fourth column? I looked online and column-major order is going down in the matrix instead of right, and then after that it goes to the next column, and continues.

1372241914.0,1h3ly7,"Low performance on a AMD Readon HD 6770M (OpenGL 3.2) with 1,906,359 Vertices (635,453 Triangles)",nitrocrime,2,

For the past couple of days I've been experimenting with OpenGL via SDL on my Macbook (running Mountain Lion) in a 3.2 context. It works like it should but I somehow think that the performance is just way slower then what it can actually handle.

Right now I've got a scene that draws a 26Mb ship (obj format, textures or light added yet and it's going at a steady 26 FPS instead of 60 FPS. On fullscreen mode it drops even further down to 20 FPS.

The object has 1, Y and Z in float) that create 635,453 GL_TRIANGLES when drawing. The model looks great just like it should but the FPS dropped from 60 FPS to 26 FPS with just that model being drawn.

Am I expecting to much from my GPU or is there something I can do to fix this? I've also got the same kind of issue when I want to draw multiple objects instead of just a big one

Here's the code I use to initialise the OpenGL object and upload everything to the GPU

    void OBJModel::finilizeGL()
    {
    	//Create the vertex buffer
    	glGenBuffers(1
    	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    	glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    	
    	glGenVertexArrays(1
    	glBindVertexArray(vao);
    	
    	
    	//Create the shader
    	basicShader = new BasicShader_P();
    	
    	//Set the projection
    	glm::mat4 proj = glm::perspective(45.0f, 1000.0f);
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniProj, glm::value_ptr(proj));
    	
    	printf(""%i vertices\n""
    }

And the code I use to render my object

    void OBJModel::render()
    {
    	//Activate current data for the render
    	basicShader-&gt;activate();
    	//tx-&gt;activate();
    	glBindVertexArray(vao);
    	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    	
    	
    	//Model position
    	glm::mat4 model;
    	//Set the position
    	model = glm::translate(model,Z));
    	//Rotate the object
    	model = glm::rotate(model, 0.0f, 0.0f));
    	model = glm::rotate(model, -1.0f, 0.0f));
    	model = glm::rotate(model, 0.0f, -1.0f));
    	//Set the scale
    	model = glm::scale(model,scale));
    	//Send to the GPU
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniModel, glm::value_ptr(model));
    	
    	
    	//View matrix (should be bound to the entire scene)
    	glm::mat4 view = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3( 0.0f,//eye
    								 glm::vec3( 0.0f,//target
    								 glm::vec3( 0.0f
    								 );
    	glUniformMatrix4fv(basicShader-&gt;uniView, glm::value_ptr(view));
    	
    	
    	//Draw the image
    	glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES
    	//glDrawElements(GL_QUADS, (void*)0);
    	
    	
    	//Check for any errors
    	GLenum error = GL_NO_ERROR;
    	while((error = glGetError()) != GL_NO_ERROR)
    	{
    		printf(""OpenGL Error in Cube::render(): %s\n""
    	}
    }

The BasicShader_P is a class that just handles the creation of a shader that just accepts and uses a vertex position.

I've tried uploading just the vertices as their original state and using a indices array to tell the GPU which point to use to draw a triangle but that just hasn't worked at all

Is there anything I can do to increase the performance drastically?

The mainView-&gt;render() takes only ~0.15 Milliseconds while the SDL_RenderPresent(ren) takes up 41 Milliseconds. How to fix?

Edit 2:

I ported the code over to a Cocoa and Objective-C project with a NSOpenGLView and instantly got up to 30-48 FPS (Once it get to about 30 FPS it jumps right back up to 48 FPS and starts to decline again (each time taking about 15 seconds). But anyway I know I won't be using SDL anymore (plus my engine I'm working on will only require a wrapper in the language of your choice at the end so the port was really easy)

Edit 3:

Ok I have no idea what the heck is going on with my Macbook right now.. Now the SDL app without any changes over the slow version is running at 40 FPS as well.. Dafuq?

Edit 4:

Problem found thanks to /u/kimixa the glDrawArrays() was drawing sizeof(Vertex_P)*vertexAmount amount of vertices which is sizeof(Vertex_p) to much. I had some wierd graphical glitches before without it (probably my own fault) but it just shot up to 80-180 FPS (switching quite a bit) on the Cocoa and Objective-C version and 60 FPS on the SDL version!

So, and this texture is the output of the previous filtering.

Let's say I have around 20 points on the texture, my framerate is horrible.

Now, as far as I know. This is a mathematical use-case, and the only way to get information from GPU to CPU is by rendering the texture so the host can read it as 'array'.

But this is why I ask here

Now

* first of all: in general
* It might be helpful if I only know the x-coordinates of the points
* Is there any way I can transform the texture to 1D (shrink the texture to only one 'line' of values
* I also thought of horizontal lines generated by vertex shader
* I know

If you've got any idea, anything?

I've been doing some basic research into implementing ""bokeh"" depth of field. I'm trying to get a general understanding of it before digging into particular implementations and tutorials and in this process I've come up with some of my own ideas.



If anyone has experience with this and wants to share their knowledge I'd appreciate it!


My idea is this:


Deferred shading already requires you to render to many screen buffers that contain, the uniqueness of bokeh vs. standard DOF implementations is that the blurring is radial and is effectively a series of circular sprites for each out-of-focus point. The radii of these circles is based on the unsigned distance from the focal plane of the lens (i.e. an absolute value of the difference between the center pixel's depth and the depth of the other pixels)


I was thinking that an efficient way of getting these bokeh sprites would be to render the color buffer to lower resolution textures (which you're likely already doing for bloom or other post-processing effects) and create a circle-grid that looks something like [this](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/F/D/l/I/A/L/circles-chess-board-md.png) which can be used to mask the low-res textures such that you get a series of circles instead of pixels.


Then, (i.e. use depth difference as alpha so areas close to the focal plane will not be blurred and areas furthest will be completely blurred).



My questions to you guys are:


1. Is this even what bokeh DOF is all about?



2. What resources for bokeh DOF do you guys have handy that don't turn up easily in google?



3. Are my ""optimizations"" really optimizations at all? Or am I overcomplicating the problem?



4. Would this look any better than a gaussian blur texture blended with a similar method as I describe in my last paragraph.

I do this because most tutorials and books focus on teaching you new stuff on a single triangle/cube/... and I want to try to create a wrapper for OpenGL so I can play around a bit.

What I'm doing here is drawing two red triangles: one in the upper left corner of the screen and one in the lower right

**Vertex shader**
    
    #version 330
    
    layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
    
    void main()
    {
        gl_Position = position;
    }

**Fragment shader**
    
    #version 330
    
    out vec4 outputColor;
    
    void main()
    {
        outputColor = vec4(1.0f, 1.0f);
    }
    
I call glUseProgram so that the shaders are used and then call glutMainLoop (I'm using freeglut).
The draw callback is the following method:

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    triangle1.render();
    triangle2.render();
    glutSwapBuffers();
    
The render code from the Triangle class is implemented as follows:

    glGenBuffers(1
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
    
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
    glVertexAttribPointer(0, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);
    
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES
    
    glDisableVertexAttribArray(0);
    
So

* Do I really need to create the VBO every draw call
* If I want to use a different shader for the two triangles
* Should I keep a reference to shaders in the objects that use them or just store them in some ShaderManager and call glUseProgram in the render code of the according triangles (well

Finally
* Do big products usually exist of multiple shaders? If so

So the first step is: you test if a point is in front the near-plane or behind the far-plane

I use the world-space center (x1y2z3) of a 2x2 cube and have a camera that I can move around and rotate freely. All my vector and matrix stuff must be rather solid as the renderer otherwise works just fine. So here's my take (in Go) of this first part

    func (cam *Camera) frustumHasPoint(point *Vec3) bool {
    	var pc Vec3
    	v := point.Sub(&amp;cam.Controller.Pos)  // point minus camPos
    	ref := cam.Controller.dir  // take a copy of camDir
    	ref.Z = -ref.Z
    	ref.Normalize() // camDir was already normalized but anyway...
    	pc.Z = v.Dot(&amp;ref)
    	if pc.Z &gt; cam.Perspective.ZFar || pc.Z &lt; cam.Perspective.ZNear {
    		return false
    	}
    	return true
    }

Now why do I reverse the Z of ref? Because in the tutorial they write: ""Notice that the referential in the figure is not a right hand system (as in OpenGL)

Well if do reverse Z as above

This stuff should be so simple right? What am I missing? Been thinking long and hard about this and just not getting anywhere.. would greatly appreciate any pointers...

So here's what I've got: (Disclaimer: I'm very new to OpenGL)

Inside my openGL display function:

* I find and track the circle created by the Playstation Move controller on screen. (I do this by finding the center of the circle)

* On each frame I compare the x and y values of the current center of the circle to the x and y values of the center found in the previous frame. This is how I determine movement / adjust the openGL program.

* If the center has changed by at least 4 pixels in any direction I consider that movement and adjust the sphere on screen accordingly.

So

This seems to work ""ok"", but definitely does not respond in a natural way.

I'm posting this here because my OpenCV/object tracking code seems to work

Am I taking this in the right direction? I can't help but think that some of my issues come from trying to relate differences in pixel locations to translations in OpenGL. I assume there's no way that I can relate my openCV coordinate system (0, and translating is the only way to go, how should I be approaching this?

I hope this makes sense. I tried to break down the problem as much as I could without writing a book

At the same time I want to ideally keep using the ""kinda-sorta inofficial quasi-standard"" matrix functions for lookat and perspective

    func (me *Mat4) Lookat(eyePos
    	l := lookTarget.Sub(eyePos)
    	l.Normalize()
    	s := l.Cross(upVec)
    	s.Normalize()
    	u := s.Cross(l)
    	me[0], me[12] = s.X, u.X, -l.X, -eyePos.X
    	me[1], me[13] = s.Y, u.Y, -l.Y, -eyePos.Y
    	me[2], me[14] = s.Z, u.Z, -l.Z, -eyePos.Z
    	me[3], me[15] = 0, 0, 0, 1
    }
    
    //	a: aspect ratio. n: near-plane. f: far-plane.
    func (me *Mat4) Perspective(fovY, f float64) {

    // world-space position:
    camPos := cam.Pos

That works well. Moving the camera in all 6 degrees of freedom produces correct on-screen movement and correct new camera world-space coords.

But geometry is still inverted on the Z-axis. When I position two boxes, -2), to appear near-left and B (2, 1, 2) to appear far-right,  then A appears far-left and B appears near-right. Z is still inverted here.

1336389636.0,tb0qb,Help! Primitive color stuck on a single shade of red and I can't find a working solution.,Celdecea,7,1,17,"***EDIT: SOLVED*** The issue was with this line:

    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GL_DEPTH);

If I remove GL_DEPTH everything works fine. I remember now when I added it during my experiments. While testing I kept copying around the block I posted below so essentially I was spreading my own shit around.

***SUMMARY:*** My onboard Intel 82865g video adapter does not like depth buffers. Requesting one with GL_DEPTH causes glClearColor to be ignored and all primitives to be rendered red. 

***EDIT2:*** genpfault notices that I still don't know what I'm doing. I was using GL_DEPTH (0x1801) instead of GLUT_DEPTH (0x10). This appears to have enabled GLUT_INDEX by mistake. Indeed

My project can move forward again. Seems small but that was very frustrating. Thank you for those who responded.    

---------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

All of my colored primitives (in this case quads) are coming out red. There are a few posts about it on the internet but the only ""solved"" one says it's a graphics driver issue. I've uninstalled

The funny thing is that it worked fine just a few weeks ago! I was experimenting with lighting and ever since then no matter what I do shapes are the same ugly shade of red in all of my development projects.

One site mentions that I've enabled something. THAT'S GREAT. I'm ok with that if anybody could possibly tell me what it is so I could disable it. If you say ""lighting"" please tell me if I have to disable GL_LIGHTING or some other thing like LIGHT0 etc. If you say ""texturing"" please tell me if there is something besides ""GL_TEXTURE_2D"" I'm supposed to consider.

Thank you in advance for any useful advice. This is the stupidest crap I've ever had to try to solve.

I thought that one version can't be such a difference but it looks like it does. I thought I can just alter the shader code to an older version and the first step I did for a triangle was ""removing the layout (location = x) thing"". I did this and... No triangle. I googled a little bit and saw the OpenGL 3.2 video of the WWDC presentation and I read something about binding the elements in my shader. I did this as well and... No triangle.

I can't learn new stuff without trying it. Of course I can learn the theory but I don't feel comfortable without trying this stuff out.

Is there a guide or a tutorial for GLSL 1.50? Maybe in comparison with GLSL 3.00 especially for platforms that don't support OpenGL 3.3 and GLSL 3.30? What about book you can recommend?

1367021427.0,1d6soi,glReadPixels() maxing out CPU,reckson,5,0,12,"I'm playing around with [Berkelium](http://berkelium.org/)

The issue I'm having is that the glReadPixels() call I'm doing to get the color value under the mouse is maxing out a full CPU core. If I don't do the pixel read I get only about 2% CPU usage. I do not get a framerate hit from this CPU usage. With glReadPixels() disabled or enabled I get about 1550FPS. I've read that this might happen because the CPU has to convert the pixel format but both my render buffer and my glReadPixels() call are using GL_RGBA and I'm only reading a single pixel. Is it happening because glReadPixels() has to wait for the GPU to finish drawing? But why is the CPU maxed out when I'm vsync'ed to 60FPS and it can handle 1550FPS?

Code formatting isn't working for me so I'll give you some line numbers in my barebones experiment:
https://github.com/ThomasColliers/glexp-gui/blob/master/gui.cpp

Setup of the framebuffer at line 67

Line that causes CPU to become maxed out at line 246

I'm also having minor accuracy issues since I'm limited to 255 values for the mouse coordinates. I assume that I should be able to fix this by using a higher resolution color buffer? Right now I'm also using another color attachment for identification of the right ""window""/object. I'm probably just going to use 2 color channels for the texture coordinate and 1 color channel for identification in a single color attachment.

***Edit:*** Thanks for your input everyone. I'm using 2 PBO's now which solves the CPU load problem. I'll look into doing this on the CPU in the future. For now,False,,t5_2qzvf,1367169782.0,,,t3_1d6soi

There are two ways we could interpolate between two vec4 values: (1) just interpolate each component, interpolate, and convert back.

I think it's pretty obvious that (1) is what is done with varying vec4 variables. But I've found lots of code that seems to assume (2) is the method used.

In particular, and then expect it to be interpolated correctly, we are on thin ice.** But lots of people do this. Google ""varying vec4"", and you'll quickly see what I mean.

So

HOWEVER.

There is a varying vec4 position that is a built-in: gl_TexCoord[]. Yes, and then it chooses between the two interpolation methods? That doesn't seem possible. And yet, glTexCoord is there, staring me in the face. Apparently the designers of GLSL thought it would be interpolated correctly. (And even if I don't want to use gl_TexCoord, all the advice out there -- google it -- tells me to make my own varying vec4, which will still be interpolated incorrectly, right?)

Can someone please explain?

Say I have two points: (1, 3, 3). Halfway between these two should be (2, 2, 2).

Currently I store the model matrices of each instance in a vertex buffer which is sent to the shader as an attribute on a per-instance basis.

I'm curious as to the pros and cons of tweaking the implementation so that only the 4x3  matrix which corresponds to the instances' transformations is stored in the buffer.

How concerned should I be about saving memory in these sorts of situations? And is there often a sizable speed trade-off for doing so? Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer :)",,t5_2qzvf,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1kc88n/question_pros_cons_of_saving_gpu_memory/

It seems odd to me that anyone would want to fix this problem by adding perspective to the texture that is being mapped on the trapezoid.

What do I have to do to get these version 150 shaders to work? 

Edit:

Solved! Big thanks to /u/kimixa for pointing out the problem. Apparently I forgot to set the SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK in order to force OpenGL to create a 3.2 context.

Right now before I create my SDL_Window I have these lines of code:

    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK

The weird thing is that when I use 1 to 5 textures it runs smoothly but if I sample six textures suddenly the framerate drops drastically (down to 1 fps).

So (in my fragment shader)

I'm working on a OpenGL 3.2 engine for a little game I'm working on and I've got a issue with my matrix math.

Right now I'm using the glm library (a header only library) and sending the values of the matrix to the Vertex Shader. The problem is that if I have my target and eye pos both be at 0.0f on all axis it crashes. The crash is basically a assert to check if there is a greater difference then 0.0 because after that it divides the value by another value (also 0) which will cause a real crash.

I tried using the gluLookat method and requesting the matrix to send to the shader but there I just get a invalid operation error from OpenGL.

Is there a other library I should use or is there a way to make the gluLookat work?

So I've conceded that if I really want the superb super-fancy graphics I'll need to use Open GL to do the additive blending. Otherwise I'll just have to use normal sprites without any fancy lighting effect.
So to my questions... (So far I'm using bitmaps).

Does additive blending with OpenGL work in a similar way to additive blending on the canvas? (using greyscale images

What have I done wrong? The data within the FBX is in pairs of 2 and each triangle has a UVmap index which it pulls from the loaded array.

Also this is a strip down of my code which is a temporary project. Once I've got everything working (and actually loading in the FBX from the file itself) I'll have re-written it into a c++ class.


Edit:

To those who may interrest it I have found the problem. The OBJ UV maps don't use position 0 as the start of their data. It starts at 1 so you just needed to add 1 to the UV data pointer and it's good to go.",,t5_2qzvf,1371506539.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/19qeub/cglut_uv_positions_messed_up_in_fbx_file_via_a/

Fun story... A year ago I asked you how to do a thing, a year off the school and $2000+ in expenses.

    begin
        glBindVertexArray(VAO);
        glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, PGLvoid(I * 2 * Columns));
    glBindVertexArray(0);
    end;

I can't draw the whole surface in one go
I decided to start a strip over for each row
Indices order is 0-3-1-4-2-5-3...

Is that supposed to work that way? How do I take the strip apart?

One way to avoid having to iterate through every object is to section objects into different areas so that each area will have roughly the same number of objects in them... but how do I accomplish this if I haven't drawn all the objects yet!? For example

1324941195.0,nrl63,Geometry representation questions,travis134,3,1,1,"**FOREWORD**:



Hello! I am moderately experienced with 3d rendering from some XNA development. I decided that it was time to broaden my knowledge by learning Open GL. I'm picking up Open GL ES 2.0 for Android for fun. I tend to learn new frameworks and languages by setting a specific goal for myself which requires the use of that framework or language. This time




**STRUCTURE**:




* *Vector*: I'm using the Java extension, Normals, etc).




* *Vertex*: This class represents a single vertex of a given primitive. Information this holds is the Position of the vertex, etc.




* *Primitive*: This class represents a single primitive of a given model. A primitive holds a buffer of Vertex objects and a GLEnum specifying the type of primitive (TRIANGLES




* *Model*: This class represents a complete model




**QUESTIONS**: 




* I understand the difference between DrawArray and DrawElements, but what I eventually want to do is have the indices and vertices arrays generated as the model is generated. The best way I can think of doing this is as follows: create a hashcode method in the Vertex class which returns a hash which is only unique on the Vertex's position, loop through the input vertex array (an unpruned array of vertices which may or may not have been reused), store the vertices in a hashmap as a key with an integer as the value which represents when the vertex was used (The current index iterating through the original array of vertices), then create a new indices and vertex array from the hashmap. Is this approach appropriate? I don't love the use of dynamic memory, but I can't think of a better way to generate these values.




* Are Draw calls really that expensive? I read that you should minimize the number of Draw calls you use throughout your rendering. Currently I call the Draw on every primitive in every model in a given scene. This is because for a model like a sphere, so should I do this instead of creating so many primitives?




* I heard that using the scale methods on a model matrix can cause issues if collision detection is necessary later on/ Is this true? And if so




* I eventually want to create a crappy rip-off of Marble Blast Gold for Android (For free and for fun as a hobby). I can't think of any other way to do this without very expensive collision detection (OBB vs Sphere or Convex hull vs sphere)

I am a moderately experienced programmer who is interested in learning all of the basics of modern OpenGL. I have been completing the helpful and well-made tutorials at www.open.gl. There are a few aspects which I've had trouble with.

1. Has anyone else had an issue trying to **dynamically link the GLFW library**? I have been forced to link it statically due to a plethora of linker errors. I am using Windows 7 64-bit.

2. In regards to the GLM library,zNear,zFar***)** show a black screen? I have followed [the open.gl tutorial](http://www.open.gl/transformations) very closely, and I have compared [his final code](http://www.open.gl/content/code/c4_3d.txt) with mine several times - yet whenever I try and multiply the matrix that results from glm::perspective() by my own matrix - all I see is a black screen. It doesn't seem to matter if I do the multiplication within the vertex shader or in my main cpp file. I should also note that all I am drawing is a 6-point GL_TRIANGLES (so essentially a rectangle). All points exist on a single plane (the rectangle is ""2D"").

Even if my issues are too specific to warrant help

EDIT1: I can use a breakpoint to look at the contents of any matrix

My goal is to integrate the SilverLining weather engine into X-Plane 10 to enhance the weather.  I basically want to know if this is possible? Kickstarter will hopefully help me fund the SilverLining license and development costs.

X-Plane currently runs in 32bit and 64bit and uses a plugin system to integrate any 3d party add-ons into the simulator.  Here is a link to the plugin SDK for X-Plane:

http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/mediawiki/Main_Page

And a link to the X-Plane 10 demo(you can develop from this):

http://www.x-plane.com/downloads/x-plane_10_demo/?AFFID=83402&amp;gclid=CNa0l4Sd5rcCFYKd4AodYEQAfw

Here is a link to the SilverLining SDK:

http://sundog-soft.com/sds/features/real-time-3d-clouds/

I am a non programmer and this is a very early inquiry into the possibility.  The X-plane 10 weather engine is very complex but graphically it lacks.  SilverLining would need to work with the weather engine but it would need to replace how the environment is displayed for a more realistic environment.

I already have a few add-ons for X-Plane which have been successful and I would love to expand on this in the future:
