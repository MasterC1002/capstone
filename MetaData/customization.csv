First off
 
If you are absolutely new to theming and skinning
 
After you have gotten familiar with RocketDock
 
Download it and get familiar with the menus. Once you have checked it out a bit
 
You will probably also want to change your start orb so it fits with your overall theme. To do this
 
Interested in more changes? You can use [CursorFX](http://www.stardock.com/products/cursorfx/) to change your cursor style.
 
You can also change folder and app icons like [so](http://www.lifehacker.com/5898507/how-to-customize-any-folder-or-app-icon-in-windows) (thanks [Kylde](http://www.reddit.com/r/customization/comments/rqb7z/how_to_customize_any_folder_or_app_icon_in_windows/))

Right click on the dock to bring up options for changing something about the dock location, programs attached, etc. I believe it is under preferences when right-clicking the dock. To change icons, you can download the images from either the RocketDock website or http://www.deviantart.com/  then extract the zipped file and put the images in the icon folder located in (C:)&gt;Program Files (x86)&gt;RocketDock then right click the icon on the dock you wish to change and follow the options.

2. OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
3. CPU: AMD FX-4100 Zambezi 3.6GHz AM3+ 95W Quad-Core
4. GPU: 2x GeForce GTX 550 Ti SLI
5. Sound Card: See mobo
6. RAM: 4x 4gb G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 240-Pin DDR3 1600
7. Optical Drive: Blu-Ray Burner
8. Old HD: 1.5tb Western Dig 7200rpm
9. New SSD: Samsung 840 120GB SATA III

I've had this fairly modest rig for a couple years now

I've finally bought a new SSD in hopes of speeding up processing times, there are a couple areas I'm uncertain about and was hoping for some advice:

1. My Windows disk is an ""upgrade"" disc

2. I know I need mobo and GPU drivers, or RAM require any drivers?

3. I assume the OS won't take up the whole space, would they have to go too?), other games, Office, Rainmeter, any useful freeware?

4. Where is a good stopping point to create a clean image backup to keep on the old HD? What's a good strategy to decide which essential programs make the cut for that image?

Feel free to add your own tips!

***

###How do I get this data and stuff on my desktop?

A little app called Geektool. To quote its maker: 

&gt;GeekTool is an app for Mac OS 10.6+ It lets you display various kinds of information on your desktop via 3 default plug-ins:

&gt;File plugin to monitor MacOS X activity with /var/log/system.log, CPU load, memory availability on your server with tools like [MRTG](http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/) or [RRD](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/). 

Here are some links to download it:

* [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geektool/id456877552?mt=12)

* [Tynsoe](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/download.php).

***

###Okay

Check out some GeekTool script repositories for a start. 

I recommend [this](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/) as your first stop.

Once you're more comfortable

***

###How do I display what music I'm playing?

Use [Bowtie](http://bowtieapp.com/) -- it has a whole boatload of different themes and it's constantly being updated with more.

***

###How can I hide my desktop icons?

I personally use [Camouflage](http://www.briksoftware.com/products/camouflage/). It's $5.99. But do some snooping around with your internet skills and you can find a free copy.

***

###How do I change my dock icons?

[This guide](http://pimpmymac.wordpress.com/2007/03/05/how-to-change-icons/) will take care of your folders

***

###How do I get rid of the menu bar? 

Well, but you should still be able to download the app using this link). Go into Preferences and check the box for ""Dim when inactive"". If you're going for a dark theme, check ""Invert menu bar"" too.

***

###How do I change my dock background?

This can be done using [CandyBar](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/08/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/) or [Blacktree Secrets](http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-secrets/). 

***

###Ideas and inspiration?

* Windows-based with preferrably Aero transition support. *(I can hack something together for Linux if it doesn't already exist.)*
* Scaling and cropping to fit one image to both monitors while compensating for the differenciation in DPI.
* Taking into programmable compensation for the physical distance in both height and width between the two LCDs so as to allow curves and slants to not jump. Purposful loss in image swaths desirable to make it seem as a window into the images.

Currently I am trying to add additional launchers in enigma instead of the usual 5. I copy-paste one of the folders, the problem comes when I try and move it in proximity of another launcher icon.

[This picture](http://i.imgur.com/uVSRU.jpg) shows my desktop in the super early stages. The problem is that right now

Edit for clarification: After a little testing it appears all of the launchers have this dead space that you can still click on to launch the app. It extends about again as long as the text displays

Another Edit: Changing the SkinWidthMultiplier to 1 from 2 seems to help,False,self,t5_2sfgt,True,,,t3_miea0
