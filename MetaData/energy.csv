The first half of my proposal has nothing to do with thorium, in a different category (Global instead of National).

If I win both, IFR, and fuel-from-CO2 technologies. LFTRs seem the most promising to me and I know the most about them, so that'll be the bulk of it.

The Global proposal is only three votes behind right now. Just thought some of you might like to know.

**Edit**: Looking a bit scary at the moment...there's a team in India that's picked up about 50 votes so far today under National. They were deep in third place and are still about a hundred votes behind

The Office of Nuclear Energy believes that nuclear power has a critical role in providing safe, and affordable electricity.  In order to achieve these goals, extensive research and development has been conducted on a wide variety of nuclear power plant designs in order to increase efficiency while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.  We are currently funding research on several advanced Generation IV reactors including Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs), High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors as part of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project, and Fluoride High Temperature Reactors (FHRs).  Specifically related to thorium reactors, we are also funding a study at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to evaluate the transition of a uranium-fueled fast reactor to a thorium-fueled fast reactor.  The goal of this study is to understand the implications of transitioning to a thorium core and compare the performance with a uranium-based reference core.  However, this effort will be focused on using a fixed fuel form rather than having the fuel dissolved in the liquid salt

 

From a fuels perspective, could be modified to utilize thorium fuel.  However, the Unites States does not currently possess the infrastructure to process thorium or to fabricate thorium fuel.  This commercial capacity would need to be developed before thorium fuel could be used for commercial power production.

(looking at ""Beta Gross Count Rate (CPM)""


____


I'm responding to these parts of the [conspiracy theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/) (the parts dealing with claimed radiation anomalies):

&gt;**EDIT 7 comes first: To those who say it was still a malfunction:**

&gt;You miss a VERY elementary point: one detector was privately ran in South Bend. That one ""malfunctioned"". But then the data is corroborated by a federally ran detector in Ft Wayne, AR 12 hours later](http://i.imgur.com/sRYMi.png), which lines up with [the wind maps](http://hint.fm/wind/). For those that don't seem to know, that's a long way away from Ft Wayne. And the ""average"" CPM level in Little Rock has been around 8 CPM for the past 12 months.

....

&gt;EPA's ""near-realtime"" open-air geiger counter for Ft Wayne Indiana [no longer shows live data but cuts off May 19th](http://www.epa.gov/radnet/radnet-data/radnet-ftwayne-bg.html). This morning, WE CAN STILL PULL THE DATA UP [as in this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/KVEqg.png) &lt;- For more cities and a breakdown of the wind spread, [check here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/c4xo9gt)

**to samseed101**, and it *was* an isolated incident, so I think it is justified. Although I agree that personal attacks and profanities should not be used in the way uvdiv\_blog used, there could/should have been notices and warnings if you were introducing this as a sort of policy. I didn't see any evidence of these, and it was isolated, so it does appear to be a mild bit of censorship (for what reason or cause, I'm not going to postulate). I'm sorry

*****

**to uvdiv\_blog/demre/uvdiv\_is\_banned**, I ask that you delete the account 'uvdiv\_is\_banned', and continue use of 'uvdiv\_blog'. I will try to keep my eye on it so that the auto-ban doesn't catch the comments from that account anymore.

But *please* be civil with your commenting. Personal attacks and profanities in your arguments make you sound like senile old grumpy asshole. The following sample of comment fragments from you are not welcome

&gt;* This is fucking bullshit. I demand a public apology and retraction from the imbecile journalists at Guardian

&gt;* Ha! Denmark is a fucking case study on the necessity of hydropower for backing wind farms.

&gt;* the page is still there

&gt;* You're full of horse manure.

&gt;* Go fuck yourself.

&gt;* But unlike you fucking morons (you know who you are)

If somebody's attacking you, these attacks of yours are given purely out of your own frustration and anger. Let your facts and opinions speak for themselves.

And here is a chart in the paper that shows his projections for energy usage that pretty much summarizes the whole paper...

As you can see

Hubbert's paper has some great quotes in it:

* The world appears to be on the threshold of an era which in terms of energy consumption will be at least an order of magnitude greater than that made possible by the fossil fuels.
* The energy content of this [uranium deposit] per square mile is equivalent to 30 billion barrels of oil
* There is promise, and provided the world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the ""foreseeable future.""
