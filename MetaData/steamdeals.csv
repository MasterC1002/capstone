**EDIT: I was wrong. The sale did not begin on this date. See [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) for further information.**

Reddit has been a great place to get information on these sales, [squidthesid](//www.reddit.com/user/squidthesid), [CommentStatistics](//www.reddit.com/user/CommentStatistics) and others. Subreddits like /r/gaming and /r/games have played host to these redditors' daily posts, while subreddits such as /r/steamdeals and /r/GameDeals have carried the torch between the big sales. Thanks to you all! You make these sales so much fun!

*Sadly

**But here's where I need help from all of you.**

I'd like your input on the ways we could improve the daily sales posts. Below is a template for my daily sale posts. It is based on previous sale posts by ltx and Remmib (such as [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4os/steam_holiday_sale_2011_day_11/) and [this](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nv4ok/steam_holiday_sale_day_11_useful/)).

What should be added? Changed? Removed? I'm particularly interested in those pieces of information that are most helpful to redditors when deciding whether or not to buy a game.

Keep in mind that there is a 10, assembling the information for these posts is time-consuming, so any resources (such as [this](//steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List) and [this](//www.steamprices.com/)) you can provide for finding information is most appreciated.

**Original**: Hi everyone

What we'll be giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love

[Arcen Games](http://twitter.com/arcengames)

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",self,t5_2riw6,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/nla4m/hi_rsteamdeals_were_running_a_few_more_game/

**[AI War Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33cpl9)**: This thread is now closed. No more entries or changes. Since this post reached above 50 points, but for the first two numbers I generate, the prize isn't just AI War anymore. It's the entire AI War Alien Bundle--the base game plus all three expansions! The third number will still get the original prize of the base game. So quite an upgrade for all who entered. :)

The first number generated is 111 (not a mistake, meaning otarU is the closest with a guess of 69. Congrats to both for winning the grand prize Alien bundle, woo!!!

The third number generated is 17

**[Tidalis Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33cqac)**: This thread is now locked. Our first number generated is 46, but since they both guessed exactly right, it's better if they both win copies. Our third number generated is 50, which means OlgM guess exactly right! Congrats to you four and check your respective inboxes for your copy of the game. :)

**[A Valley Without Wind Giveaway (CLOSED)](http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/mrw8p/ai_war_and_tidalis_our_games_are_on_massive_sale/c33csbu)**: This thread is now closed.

**ORIGINAL**:Hi! Our titles are up on Steam at big discounts through this morning. You can grab our deep space strategy game [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off


So we wanted to throw out a last minute reminder, we'll be giving away a key for our latest effort A Valley Without Wind (currently available in [public beta for $10](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy)) as well.


Per request I'll be giving out the keys as such: I'll be commenting requests for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the keys to their inboxes.

Have yet to seen it on their big Christmas sales and I'm starting to think Bethesda won't let Steam cut the price. How likely do you think that it will ever go on sale?

**Update:** I've decided to go ahead and get it since there is not guarantee that Steam will have it on sale during the summer. Plus I will be traveling over the summer so I'll either not be here for it or I might get cheap and not want to spend money before the trip. Thanks for the advice Reddit.

(All titles except *Darksiders*

Additionally

___

Speculation:

THQ really doesn't have that many games listed on Steam, so I think it unlikely that it will be reduced further (but it might (edit: lol, it did)). *Full Spectrum Warrior* is definitely on the table, however, and I wouldn't be surprised to see both games in the sub-$5.00 range if they go on sale. Additionally, a stand-alone game such as *Saint's Row 2* or *STALKER* is likely at some point during the sale. Darksiders was just released ($40), so I doubt we'll see a sale for it.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/steamdeals/comments/dwb6s/thq_sale_all_this_week_check_back_daily_for_75_off/
