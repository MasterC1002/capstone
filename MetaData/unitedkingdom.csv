1374251721.0,1in1pl,Howdy UK. Referred from /r/WorldNews A Texan (accustomed to Heat Waves) has some tips for you..,MadManuel,1476,366,1194,"Some of these tips may come across as fairly Red-Neck.. mostly because they are.. The rest are common sense. 

Today in Austin

1. Box Fans. &amp; Swamp Coolers
You can normally find these in hardware stores, I'm going to guess they're around 20£. 

Big blocks of ice are typically hard to come by, or in worst case scenario, a bucket. Fill the cooler or bucket up with ice, and then set the box fan up, such that it is blowing air across the ice. This is basically a swamp cooler.. It's not as good as A/C but it will cut the heat enough that you can function. 

Bonus technique..: The worst part about a heat wave is trying to sleep through it at night. This is a slightly crazier technique but if it's so hot out you've ditched you're sheets

Set up your wall o' box fans (2-3, instead of ice (which is often hard to get in the middle of the night) you take your top sheets off the bed, and haul them into the bath tub, and soak them. Then wring out the sheet so that it is damp, but not so that it is dripping. then throw it back on the bed like you normally would.. 
- It feels a little wierd at first to be trying to get under a wet sheet

2. Water. 
Sort of an extension of the above.. Cold Showers, Feet, neck, head.. Cool water baths for your hands &amp; feet.. For your neck or head, I like taking a 20oz water bottle, and freezing it solid. Then I wrap a towel around it and put it behind my neck. For my head, I'll get a towel and soak it in water.. wring it out so it's still damp (but not dripping) and wrap it around my head. Especially good for sleeping.

3. Altitude.. 
I'm not sure what your living situation is

4. Hydration.
Drink water til you pee clear. Maintain that level. Add some electrolytes because invariably you're sweating some out. 
Avoid Caffeine (ya'll have decaffeinated tea right?

5. Public Places..
If there's a library
Even if only for 30min to get out of the heat.. World of difference.

6. Food
Smaller meals, have a salad.. 

7. First Aid.. 
You're going to see heat related health issues.. Either at home or at the office, and Dehydration. All can be potentially lethal. I've seen one guy literally go batshit nuts from dehydration.. Ranting and screaming..
I won't list all the symptoms here

8. Wet-T-Shirts..
Classic cotton T-shirts.. Soak em' just like the sheets. 
Cools your core tempature right down. 

9. RedNeck Heat Shields..
Get yourself a roll of tin foil, and the cardboard provides a little positive insulation against the  heat.. Sure this turns your house into something akin to a fall out shelter or cave, but at least you're cooler inside...

10. Creepy cat lady shades..
Open your windows

11. Breeze Ways.. 
You may have to experiment on which doors and windows to leave open, only to have air pressure slam the door for you.. You know what I'm talking about.. 
You want to create a path through your home that encourages air flow.. This is only going to help some of you..

12. Siesta.. 
Texas

I hope this listing helps..

Maybe we can get the Reddit Gift Exchange guys mobilized to ship UK Redditors box fans or something..

Edit: Reddit formatting screwed up my numbering.. Oh well.. you're worth two #1's. 




EDIT:
Pet/Child Warning: UPDATE FROM: /u/WishIWereHere
**DO NOT LEAVE CHILDREN OR PETS IN TURNED OFF CARS.** They will die. I'm not even joking. I know you guys don't depend on cars as much as we do here so this may not apply to you

The study found that even at 9 a.m. with an outside temperature of 28 degrees

Even just a few minutes isn't ok. If you see a child or an animal inside a locked unattended car, they can die.

EDIT:
Heat Stroke/Heat Exhaustion first Aid tips from:/u/Synthetic_Sound
Hi there - fellow Austin-ite here. I just wanted to add that one of the more common, also, this is going to sound strange, but don't drink ice water. Try drinking it at room temperature, or just below. It will cool you down faster, and won't send your body into shock (so to speak). This is especially important if you're feeling the effects of heat exhaustion or stroke. Plus, if you're super dehydrated and you drink something really cold

If you're feeling extra hot, and run it across the back of your neck. I have no idea how or why this works - but it's a pretty quick method of cooling yourself down at least temporarily.

If y'all have any other questions or such

Only one of the players can buy the stations and another can buy the utilities. This is decided after the start of the game by a tendering process where you have to bid on the ability to buy them.

If you win the tender and buy a station or utility

Chance cards now all cost you money (Bank error in their favour. Pay £300 or you'll be evicted).

Community Chest cards are only given out if you pass a physical and questionnaire from ATOS.

The only way to Get Out Of Jail is to appeal to the Supreme Court or ECHR and pay legal costs.

""Go Directly To Jail"" is to be replaced by ""Go To Embassy For Asylum"". You are then no longer allowed to participate in the game.

The bank will go bust at a random point during the game and will need to be bailed out by all players paying £500 into the bank. This will be when the first player throws a double 6.

The player acting as the banker is allowed to pay themselves a £500 bonus every time they pass """"GO""

anyone else agree? perhaps if we get enough people we could start a petition and write to a few media outlets to try and start some debate on the topic? right now is the time while its being reformed and discussed. 

if we suggested it to a couple of science magazines for example i'm sure some would be interested in printing an article about the idea.

edit: my main intention is not to design the perfect sytem but to get discussion on the topic started

- it wouldnt be unions representing teachers, experts in education sciences, medical sciences and experts in the theory of trade and social sciences.
- the idea is not to replace politics with experts but to have a house made up from peer elected specialists balancing the house of commons to ensure that their advice and opinions cannot be ignored by policians.
- probably yearly elections
- i'm not really sure how seating would be allocated fairly.. maybe the public could vote on this. it would be good to interest the public in which fields are most beneficial to their society.
- i dont think this is the best political change we could hope for
- also any form of campaigning could be made illegal. the idea being to get people chosen on merit

as the experts of a field are generally focused on the cutting edge developments in each area

I'm looking to create (or get involved in

In an initial fit of passion, was a terrible name. However, I didn't/don't feel that I, or anyone else, should alone come up with the movement's name), which has done less-than-*okay*. It's largely the name, as the community, is pretty dedicated to the cause

So what do you think it should be called? How do we start? The name is a massive barrier to entry as it's notoriously difficult to get people subscribing and resubscribing to a string of different subs and Reddit tends to be quite superficial about Sub-names alone. It would be great to hear your ideas!

Thanks

**EDIT: I'm told to point out that we're on SNOONET for those using an IRC client**

P.S. I'm trying hard to overcome the fact that Reddit makes everything we all say look a lot like oneupmanship

**EDIT: After a long IRC discussion

**[HERE'S THE LINK TO THE NAME VOTE!](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV)**

**Another Edit:** [**The Survey**](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DT83XLV) has, it'll stop at 100 submissions, and unless something bizarre happens (such as everyone voting for their own idea), then we should be good to proceed in our own Sub following that. I'll keep you in the loop, and keep voting. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: there's nothing quite like filtering through vote replies of a Summer's eve.
  
**Final Update (I think):**

To keep it as fair as possible, naturally). I also included an option for people to 'spoil' their vote by submitting their own thing, which only a handful of users opted to do. Had lots of people elected to do this, we would've had to open it up again entirely to new suggestions, so I'm glad it didn't happen. Anyway, the results are counted and verified, and here you go:


**Name**| **Weighted Results**

For that reason, and makes enough sense to support the movement and, as such, will more than suit our needs.

nbcolympicsfeedback@nbcuni.com

(from [this page on the NBC site](http://www.nbc.com/contact/general/))

Since the 'net is global

I won't post exactly what I sent, with that in mind, here's a list of the main points (from my own e-mail) that you might like to use:

 * That you're contacting them specifically about the replacement of the 7/7 tribute during the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony. No need to mention any of the other problems with the broadcast

 * You're shocked/saddened/appalled/whatever you're feeling that NBC appear to think the deaths of 52 ~~British~~ civilians on 7/7

 * Source [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-nbc-opening-ceremony) (or similar) to show you're not just some crackpot

 * That if it were the BBC that removed footage of an American tribute to the victims of 9/11

 * **Most Importantly** you believe NBC owes the British people two things:

 1. immediate

 1. honest commitment to review how decisions like the removal of the 7/7 tribute are made

By all accounts, with _specific, quantitative demands_ they should at least apologise, and _maybe_ we'll influence NBC's coverage of future events for the better.

Spread this to as many people as you can! I believe we should get a proper complain-fest going over this. I'm honestly disgusted at NBC's lack of sensitivity.

For starters I'm a sikh, or whatever and then being taunted by teenagers walking back home or to work just isn't right, there's a lot of ignorance and generalising and I would wish that people would just educate themselves more and not be completely comparable to a sheep following its flock running off a cliff when it comes to media. I don't feel safe in my own fucking home in what you could call a decent area and completely helpless when i have to head to work.

My friends on my facebook have also been making the most unreasonable posts I have ever seen in my life

Its perfectly fine to make big deals about certain events and completely ignore the others it seems, Great, not the complete opposite. 

There's always going to be bad apples in every given society but to keep on generalising a whole race, retaliation after retaliation, and yes I also get there's never going to be any peace because we all have to just accept the fact that there are dickheads and people who have some sense in their heads, especially when it comes to things like this, but sometimes I, like a lot of you need and want to get things off my chest,  I never usually post anything like this because I tend to be more of a pacifist and wait things out but it has driven me crazy to the point where I can't sleep at night.

The train companies have forgotten that they are here to provide a public service. They take advantage of the fact that people have no choice but to use their services by charging obscene prices and failing to keep up standards. I am fed up of having to pay full train fare for bus replacements. The services are unreliable in the week and unusable at the weekends. It is completely inadequate

I want the train companies be held responsible for delays. Surely electrical faults and signal failures are preventable?  I want full and complete information for why the train was delayed and whether or not the delay could have been prevented. I want a hassle-free refund for EVERY preventable delayed train I buy a ticket for. If bus replacement services are required I want them provided for free or at a heavily discounted price.

I want self service ticket machines that actually work

I don't think this is too much to ask. It's the bare minimum of what should be provided.

On Sunday, my partner was sexually assaulted outside The Eldon Pub on Woodhouse Lane in Leeds. The prominent blond haired man featured in the above video is wanted in relation to this crime. He was white, aged 25 to 40, about 5ft 7ins tall and stocky, with short blond hair and a round face. He was with a group of men who hinted that they had travelled from Durham and spoke with a Northern (possible Geordie) accent.

If anyone recognises this man or can provide any help whatsoever in tracing him

Just in case there is any doubt of authenticity
Thank you so much (from both of us) for any help that you can possible provide.

I ordered the items from Amazon
Yodel tried to deliver them to me but I was out so they gave me a card. ""Your delivery
When I got back there were two more cards for Yodel saying they tried to deliver my parcel.
I call them asking why they ignored the reschedule but they just kept saying they tried delivering to me three times and now I had to go to their service centre in Gatwick to pick it up. I live in Hove and I don't have a car so that would cost me £10 in train fare and take me 3-4 hours. They say they can put in a request for a redelivery the next day but cannot guarantee anything.
I stay in all of the next day but nothing comes. I call them the following day restating everything and they give me the number to the Amazon customer service and tell me to make a complaint!? I call Amazon who also tries to get them to get my parcel to me but they get the same response. Yodel says they can send a request for a redelivery but they cannot guarantee it. So they same story again. I say that's not good enough

TL;dr I rescheduled a delivery from Yodel

I couldn't see anything on who will send my parcel when I ordered though Amazon.co.uk. Is there any way we could still use Amazon but not use Yodel?

UPDATE
My wife complained on twitter and their twitter person responded. Yesterday there was a buzz on the door and the package (that we had decided was going to go back to Amazon for a refund) showed up. The Yodel guy looked really grumpy and the parcel had a note on it to be delivered that morning. An hour later their twitter person email my wife and said she had pulled some strings. Lucky we were in! :) Hopefully these complaints mean they will sort things out.

I'll try and not make this long

I'm a British citizen living in Spain with my South Afircan wife. I work  in Gibraltar.  My wife is a full Spanish resident with a residence card (but still holds a South African passport).

EU Laws (Free Movement Rights) clearly state that Resident Family Members of EU Citizens are free to travel anywhere within Europe as long as they are travelling with the EU Citizen.  Which means that my wife is free to travel to the UK with me for a visit home to see family.

Unfortunately the UK don't quite apply this law properly and wont recognise her ID card

This left us no option but to apply for what is called an EEA Family Permit. Which is issued to EU Citizens wanting to bring non-eu family members to the UK either to visit or to settle.   It is the UKs way of saying ""We are compliant

Ok fair enough. We applied in AUGUST

Why? Because I, Portuguese etc, then I wouldn't even have to prove that I'm working in the first place! But because I am British, I do!   This means that other EU citizens have MORE RIGHTS to bring foreigners into the UK than British citizens do!  They didnt even want any police clearance checks or CRB Checks from my wife. They refused because I work in Gibraltar.  Guess what, Gibraltar is part of the UK yeah? Well she can go there!


Now its too late to appeal and too late to apply for a visit visa.  The EU Commision has responded to a complaint and confirmed the UK are in the wrong.

But its ruined Christmas. For the first time in years my entire family were due to be together. My grandparents are getting old and one of them has been really ill this year. I cant guarantee he'll be around for next Christmas.

Any advice from anyone would be very much appreciated. I'm clutching at straws now on how I can go home for Christmas with my wife.

1375787306.0,1jsz8o,Response From My MP On The Internet Filters Debate,gadhaboy,246,31,94,"Dear GadhaBoy

Thank you for writing to me about the Prime Minister’s proposals to
introduce opt-out web filtering in the hope of tackling online child
abuse and the problem of children accessing pornographic material.

These are two very separate issues. When it comes to child abuse
images
sites known to host these
Watch Foundation to manually identify them. This is then typically
followed up with police work to identify those responsible.

The Prime Minister has argued that Google and other internet companies
need to prevent this material from being found. I think they already
do what they can to prevent this illegal material from being provided
and I think much of the rhetoric from the Prime Minister and others is
based on a misunderstanding of the role of these companies in the
internet – as I understand it
through search engines.

The separate issue of children’s access to pornographic material is a
different one
It is of course a serious problem that increasing numbers of children
have access to unsuitable material online and the law does need to
keep pace with technological advances. But censorship is not the
answer.

I have no problem with tools being made available to people who have
an internet connection to allow them to choose whether to apply any
filters. In the same way
spam filters. However
and there should certainly be no central register of who has decided
not to.

I do have concerns about the filters
that people understand what they do and do not do. There will be
problems of both over-blocking and under-blocking. Under-blocking will
mean that sites which people think ought to be blocked will not be
and so it is important that people do not assume a false sense of
security – leaving a young child unsupervised to surf the internet
will not guarantee that they stay within a walled garden
do not have the technical skill to bypass the controls.

Over-blocking is particular a concern when it filters out websites
such as those offering people advice about a range of subjects such as
sex
irresponsible for the government to prevent young people from
accessing website offering advice and information about subjects which
they may find hard to discuss with family or friends.

Unfortunately
Minister and most MPs and officials about how the internet actually
works
practically sensible. You can see a more detailed speech I made on
this subject in Parliament
similar steps to those the Prime Minister is proposing at
http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-06-12a.360.0#g389.0

Now I know this is a massive *massive* long shot but my girlfriend and I were at Whitby on bank holiday Monday and managed to lose a little Lifeboat bear plushy.  It's only a small thing but it's got sentimental value to us and it would mean a lot if we could find it again.

This is a photo of the lifeboat bear: http://imgur.com/CRki6

I know it's only trivial but if you were around Whitby on Monday or know someone that was or lives around there and may have seen this fellow on the beach or up by the abbey or just about anywhere in Whitby please please get in touch.

Thank you :)

Update: No sightings of the bear yet but a quick thank you to everyone who's up voted this to get it seen. I really appreciate it :-)
