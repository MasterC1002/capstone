1369019992.0,1eo876,[Giveaway] Over 200 items to give away to you ungrateful bastards!,lowflyingmonkey,270,36,790,"So some of you might remember me, but I used to give a bunch of item away here. Around xmas was kind of crazy for me both here and in real life and i ended up taking a hiatus. However

I say items, humble bundles for example, and in a few cases i have DLC not a game. I have many more if you want to count each individual game and DLC in all bundles and such.

So what do you have to do to get your greedy little hands on my booty? Naming me the king of the world would be a good start but i figured i would start smaller so here is what you do.

**What to do to win!**

Uno: I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and i will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

Dos : Name of the game(s) you want. [List here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop6s0TdK_vRdERnQmpCaFZZTTNiMmF5OHd6R0hvMnc&amp;usp=sharing) (you can only pick 5 items)

Tres: You have 20 minutes to live, board, cards, ect) and something to play them on, and people to play with if need.  

For the lazy an easy to copy format

    1. http://steamcommunity.com/id/&lt;Custom URL&gt; or 
       http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/&lt;shit long number that corresponds to your account&gt;
    2. &lt;list of games you want&gt;
    3. &lt;answer to question 3&gt; 

**Rules/guidelines**

uno: I don't actually know Spanish and trying to speak to me in it will just confuse me

beta: Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

△:  The name of the game is entertainment. The more you entertain me the better your chances.

quad:  Hit and runs are not cool

V: You agree to give me your ~~first~~ 12th born child ^^^(ireallydon'twantkids) 

3+3: I will give what I want, it is not first come first served, There is no true end point of the giveaway (unless i run dry)  and i will be giving games thru out it

Se7en: No i don't have to

8:  You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations

8^(1):  Ok one expectation, you obviously can't activate those games, since you already have them, but in those cases i would like to request that you give back to the community.

Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great,False,,t5_2tb4r,1369021064.0,closed,spotlight,t3_1eo876
1370456826.0,1fqj8o,"[Giveaway][Steam]Hi, my name is lowflyingmonkey and I have a buying games and/or gifting problem. Just under 50 different games to give away this time.",lowflyingmonkey,232,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1fqj8o/giveawaysteamhi_my_name_is_lowflyingmonkey_and_i/

So that is just what we are doing to do. 

[Here is the Google doc file of the games being given away](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop6s0TdK_vRdDZrbW9fbFRpTFNBZ0FZN0R2MklQZFE&amp;usp=sharing)

**I will need:**

1: Name of the game(s) you want. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2: I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and i will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3: The game you are most looking forward to coming out
Or anything else you want to talk about that would be entertaining really. Just something spark a convo. So the more you say the better.
 
**RULES/GUIDELINES**

Pretty much same rules as last time. 

You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games. ( upwards of a total of 100 keys i think)

All keys are redeemable on steam.

Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

You agree to hand over all alcohol to me effective immediately ... i am out. 

The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain me the better your chances.

Hit and runs are not cool

You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game. 

Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great,False,,t5_2tb4r,1370457843.0,closed,spotlight,t3_1fqj8o

~~I somehow ended up with over 500 copies/keys for over 100 games I already have or not interested in playing so I thought there might be someone who might actually want some of these so I looking for people to gift these to. I'm not gifting to anyone just because they ask so no one is guaranteed anything as mentioned above. Also

~~If you are interested

* ~~The name of game(s) below that are interested in playing. Requesting multiple games is fine but they each should be something you actually want and you may not receive everything you ask for.~~

* ~~Provide reason why you selected the game(s). Including if you had game on your wishlist (prior to today)~~

* ~~Provide a link to your Steam profile so I can make sure you don't already have the game you are asking for if I decide to gift you. I would need to be able to see your game library to do so. A url/link must be provided or your comment will be skipped.~~

~~I will randomly review comments and gift as I please to whomever I want for any reason of my choosing. I will gift randomly for at least a week or so so offer is good until post is closed whenever I feel like I want to stop. I definitely will not be gifting everything.~~

~~If you receive something, you will be banned.~~

1370908251.0,1g2yqd,[OFFER][Steam] I still got keys I want to give away! About 40 total different games!,lowflyingmonkey,148,15,899,"So I am back with another

I am still wanting to clean out some of my spare keys. I ended up giving 15 out in the last giveaway [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1fqj8o/giveawaysteamhi_my_name_is_lowflyingmonkey_and_i/) but I still have lots of keys

Lets see what we can do to get rid of some more.

* I am using the same list as last time    
+ If the game is struck thru i no longer have it. 
- If it is not stuck thru I should still have it.

**I will need:**

1. Name of the game(s) you want from my list. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. What is your favorite gaming moment. (This can be something that scripted and you can enjoy every time you play the game. To something caused by a bug or by other players and so was more of an one off moment.) As always other things to talk about is always welcomed as well!

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

* Pretty much same rules as last time. 

+ You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

- Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games.

* All keys are redeemable on steam.

* You agree to give me your ~~left~~ right kidney if I ever need a new one. I will name him jim-bob the movable!

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances.

* Hit and runs are not cool

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game.

1371227830.0,1gchpd,[Offer][Steam]And i am back once again! I've still got more keys i want to get rid of.,lowflyingmonkey,80,5,572,"So here I am again. I still have more keys that i want to get rid of. I am finally down to just under 70 from about 100 when i started. 

I ended up giving 18 out in the last [giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1g2yqd/offersteam_i_still_got_keys_i_want_to_give_away/?limit=1500) and 15 in the one before [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1fqj8o/giveawaysteamhi_my_name_is_lowflyingmonkey_and_i/) but I still have lots of keys to give

Lets see what we can do to get rid of some more.

[LIST OF GAMES HERE!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amy_v6ca-axZdHAtcDZ5aVFFQ3RweG5xXzd6NUdDZlE#gid=0)    

+ If the game is struck thru i no longer have it. 
- If it is not stuck thru I should still have it.

**I will need:**

1. Name of the game(s) you want from my list. You can list up to 5 but you will most likely only get one. Order them from most wanted to slightly less wanted.

2. I need a steam ID in link form. I am a lazy fuck and I will skip over you if I have to work to get to your profile.

3. Describe your own perfect game. What game mechanics would be involved, what? Why? 

**RULES/GUIDELINES**

* Pretty much same rules as last time. 

+ You are guaranteed nothing and the likely hood of all the games going are slim.

- Unless the game are crossed out i still got them. I have multiple keys of many of the games.

* All keys are redeemable on steam.

* You agree that by making a request that you grant lowflyingmonkey LLC full ownership over any and all ideas in your post and any following posts in this thread.

* Your Reddit account has to be older then 3 months. (sorry new members)

* The name of the game is still entertainment. The more you entertain the better your chances. Entertainment does not have to be jokes or image or anything like that. Just talking and having a conversation can be entertaining.

* Hit and runs are not cool

* You don't have to wait for some one to respond to you to strike up a conversation. Go start one with someone else!

* You will activate your gift right away after receiving it. No expectations
Because of the nature of keys I may need you to verify that you activated the game.

* Oh if you could also upvote this post to make sure everyone gets to see it that would be great

1372885311.0,1hlbph,"[GOG] PSA- PM'ing a user, adding on steam, and ""begging"" or ""harassing"" them for a game...",Shrimplet596,74,38

First things first

With that out of the way

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A. PM'ing a user/gifter

* This

I've only given to this sub and I myself have never had this happen to me

""hey Redditorsname123

You should give me that game because I REALLLLYYY want it""  

Or

""Yo redditorsname123

**Screenshot their message

We

&gt; Since doing my [removed] giveaway, but i don't want to explicitly single out the people who did this. To be honest, after getting these messages (that seemed like begging to me), it makes me not want to gift anymore.

It's quite harmful to the community to behave like this.  ""finding"" their steam and harassing them on there for a game?  That's just low

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

B. Begging a user for a game/harassing them for not winning a game.

I've already touched on this a bit but again

* ""You know that redditor

or the comments that are so frequently removed from [Offer]s and even [Request]s...

*[offer]-*

* Hey OP! If you still have that game I'd LOOVE it if you could give me one too.  c'mon... please?  I only have 1 game and i'm new here and have no money""

*[request] (commented to somebody saying they'll gift the OP of the [request] the game)*

* ""hey man

Again

**A.** Report the comment or screenshot the PM.  

**2.** If possible

**and D.** send the Steam ID to us with either the screenshot of the PM

This will allow us to deal with the situation faster.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now

But this has to stop.  When a user says; 

&gt; it makes me not want to gift anymore.

It's a sad day here

Please

Thanks for reading this all

1375588774.0,1jnwli,[OFFER] The game you missed out on during the Steam Summer Sale that you will put a lot of hours into playing,MaximumDan,61,9,173,"So we all know that /r/GiftofGames gets very busy when there's a sale on

I usually prefer to fulfill requests rather than putting up offers because I believe someone requesting a specific game is more likely to play it than someone entering a giveaway with the hopes of winning whatever's on offer.  

So, but I'm not going to divulge which ones - only to say that most of these were on offer during the Steam Summer Sale (one in particular is often requested but rarely gifted)

If you're unsure if the game you want is on offer

So what do you need to do?  Simply tell me why you want the game and convince me you will put many hours into it.  Is the game on your wishlist?  Have you asked for it previously?  What can you tell me about the game?  These are some of the things you may want to cover as part of your post.

I'd also recommend reading my [guide to getting gifted](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1jnw0k/gog_maximumdans_guide_to_getting_gifted/) to get an idea of what I (and perhaps other gifters) look for when considering requests.  Reading it will very likely increase your chances here.

This time I will be giving away 3-5 games

Winners will be announced within 12-24 hours.

Terms &amp; Conditions

1. You must have an *active* Reddit account 2 months or older

2. Your SteamID must be included in your post (preferably as a link)

3. Giveaway items are for personal use only.  Winners must activate games immediately upon receiving them.

Thinks to be aware of

1. If your post history consists entirely of requests and giveaway entries

2. There is still an element of luck involved - even if you make an excellent post

3. I do not respond to unsolicited PMs regarding game requests.  Any such PMs will be ignored and reported to the mods.

Good luck!

**Congrats to them and thanks to everyone that entered.**

Mostly same shit

As with the other days, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day five's daily deals:

Endless Space

CAll of Duty: modern warfare Franchise

Company of heroes franchise

Mass effect Franchise

Sonic Franchise ( this is a deal with more then one item

Of orcs and men

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: Your favorite game no one has ever heard of. While i get ""nobody"" is kind of subjective in this context do truly try to give games that are obscure. Games like bastion and limbo everyone knows even if they haven't played them. It does not need to be a video game. All games count no matter how they are played. Video, pen and paper, games you played as a child, ect. If it is called a game you can put it here. Also links and deceptions of the game would be very nice too so i can learn about them. Names alone don't help much. List multiple ones if you want.

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: In the case a deal with the devil is needed

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

Well in case you haven't heard THQ is no more. They filled for bankruptcy a while back and parts of them have been sold off, unlike some other publishers.

If you ask really nicely, but don't count on it.

**This is how you get:**

1: I need your steam ID

2: Pick 3 games you want

3: Tell me what your favorite THQ game is and why.

4: Tell me what you think of the companies that bought the studios/franchises/publishing rights of THQ and how good or bad a mix they will be. ( You do not need to do each individually a general answer will do but feel free to say as much as you would like because i like discussions.)

**Rules:**

I do not have to give all games away.

For any reason i can chose not to give away a game.

You will activate your gift right away after receiving it.

Ali-sama gets all the hugs. Don't ask

Add a sob story, add whatever. idc, I'm just going to randomly select people over the ~~next couple of hours~~ next day to give these to.  Anyway, enjoy.  and if you'd want to watch me stream on twitch...PM me asking for the link.  I wont be live till tomorrow but, hey... why not. :D

ok guys

**GO!**

*EDIT: I'm going to go play some league in a few with my buddy, just a casual fuck around.   I will give out the games tomorrow, either before I live stream, or after I stream (I want to give as many people a chance to get the games as possible as I don't do these types of things often...)  Thanks everyone.  I'll be back later tonight to respond and converse with you.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EDIT2:** So some of you have been asking what I stream.  well, Castle Crashers, Trials, and others...  If you want to see the games I own, [here's my library](steam://openurl/http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shrimplet596/games?tab=all).  If you want to see the games I stream, PM me for the twitch link, or youtube link.  (again

alas, then (MOST LIKELY) either during a break, or at the end of the stream i'll come back again and do the ""winners"" post. :D

Thanks again for coming out guys.  Can't wait to see some of [your reactions](http://i.imgur.com/NXOFVHO.gif) **IF** I choose [you](http://macromeme.com/cat/your-majesty-owl.jpg) or [you](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1dtpt2/offersteampc_just_cause_2_on_sale_374_ill_take/c9tw4ok?context=3) :P

..

Please do your research on the games and franchise to make sure the games are something you would play and enjoy. Also be sure your computer meets the minimum requirements to play these games.

* The person selected for this offer will first receive **BioShock 1** to play. While playing

* Play **BioShock 2**. Continue taking screenshots of your next journey in Rapture. After completing Bioshock 2 and watching your ending

* Play **BioShock Infinite**. Again, I'll gift you a **BioShock Infinite Season Pass** so you may continue enjoying more of what BioShock Infinite has to offer when the 3 DLC content get released.

I'll be choosing people by randomly generating numbers on a website until I get a number someone picked. I also just want to hand out a HUGE thanks to all of you guys for sharing your stories. I've seen some posts thanking me for giving the games and all, but money is just money. A lot of you guys have shared some stuff that's really deep and personal, and I want to thank you for being able to do that in front of all of these strangers, whether it's in person or not.**Another Edit:** Here's some advice for anyone out there who plans on doing this in the future. If you do the number thing; don't make it go up to 10

*EDIT*
Hi Guys - I'm a little late but I'm back!  Wanted to be sure I read every story

Alot of these stories really hit home with me - especially those that brought back memories of my first time playing/beating pokemon

ImNotAnAlien!  I will be shooting you a PM sir.


---------------------------------------------------
For anyone curious - I think my most memorable (single player) gaming moment was back when I played Metal Gear Solid 1 for the first time.  I had never played a game where I got into the story so much

...What?  What CD case?  I just got a CD from the DARPA president it must be on that right?  nope.  
Well then I must have missed an item along the way.  I went back and retraced my footsteps searching for a CD I must have missed.  I searched for probably a couple of hours and finally got exceedingly frustrated and gave up.

The next day I decide to give it a try again.  I picked up the game to throw it in my PS1 and looked at the case... THE PHYSICAL CD CASE.  IT WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE BACK OF IT.  I must be a complete idiot right?  I was flooded with excitement of being able to continue the game.

My mind was kind of blown at a video game breaking the 4th wall like that (and for those that are familiar with the game

Anyway - I played through the game and it's still one of my favorite games of all time.  Again - for those familiar with the game I got the ending when you submit to torture... Right in the feels.  I remember staring blankly through the whole credits and when it was over... I started a new game with the stealth cammo.

Thanks Everyone for playing!",,t5_2tb4r,1368902624.0,closed,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1ejqez/offerpcsteam_giving_away_copy_of_borderlands_2_d/

/u/666ZOMBO666 made a request for this offer but the giver selected and replied to another user asking to add him.

/u/666ZOMBO666 took advantage of this and added the giver with the intent of impersonating the winner to get the game himself which he did end up getting under false pretenses. The actual recipient was also offline.

Giver submitted flair request indicating he gifted /u/Verthy with a screenshot of the Steam account he gifted which was found out to be /u/666ZOMBO666's Steam account and not /u/Verthy's.

**/u/666ZOMBO666's Steam account is http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079432335**

This is not the only time gift stealing has happened and there have been other cases of users doing this.

Be careful when openly asking any potential gift recipient to add you and then accepting any friend requests you get. Unfortunately

As a giver

**tl; dr Ask for Steam profile link if not already provided and needed to gift.**

Also

There has also been a case where a gift was stolen from an impersonator who changed his Steam profile name on an alternate/newly made Steam account to the Steam name provided by the recipient

The recipient did not provide a link to their Steam account and only a name which made it easy for someone to impersonate and made it difficult of the giver to find the recipient's Steam account.

**tl; dr Easy to change Steam profile name to pretend to be another Redditor; not everyone's Steam profile name is the same as their Reddit Username.**
___

If a giver can't find you or it takes a loft of effort to do so

**tl; dr Provide a working link to your Steam profile to make it easier to add and gift you.**

Well shit i slept half the day. Let day 7 begin

Mostly same sit

As with the other days, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day Seven's daily deals:

Natural selection II

 Legend of grimrock

spec ops the line

arma II

the sims 3

the walking dead

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be one of the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Give me your Steam ID link.

3: You can have one super power

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: We all agree that the friend who said he had ""all powers"" was a dick. Even if we are still friends with him. 

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

I'm actually in the process of getting a 2nd and hopefully 3rd job (2 full times and an at home job) to help with my bills/debts.

- but shrimp

Well, which is quite the task of it's own... And Ali does what he can when he can, but he's busier then me on most occasions it seems.

As for myself and my posting... I do it from work off of my phone.  And I can't provide the necessary quality checks and validate each request from my phone as it's format wouldn't work right.  Submitting posts and comments are one thing but flair assigning is an entirely different method that usually comes down to the use of 3+ Windows at any given time.  Can't exactly do that EFFICIENTLY on my phone while dealing with customers at my work.....

I try getting things together on my days off, or an interview comes up and I lose track of time.  Hell, if I end up getting these other jobs I may have to resign as mod because I'll have no time for my duties here.

I've said it to some of you before... but I'm going to say it again with more warning...

I'm off after Monday around 3pm central time... till Tuesday around 5pm... I will do my best to catch up on flair requests in that timeframe... not impossible

I'm sorry

You can continue to message mods about flairs... I encourage it honestly...but there's no promise with how busy all of us are normally on when we can get to them.

A.) Things are being reported. That's good. ***But*** this is a hassle and a half when people abuse it. I will not remove things for being offensive to you. If someone is harassing you, report it, but please also modmail us with a link and what rule it breaks, as it saves us time. 

B.) Things are getting caught in the spam filter. It happens

With the steam summer sale high sailing

1. **No begging or whining.** Pretty simple right? This means no comments that sound remotely similar to this:

&gt;Please give me this game.....

&gt;I hope I get this.....

&gt;Why can't I get this game?

And whatever variations exist in between. If I see it

2. **Do not PM gifters asking for copies of games or requesting a game.** I've already received a couple reports of this going on. This is a BANNABLE OFFENSE. That's right kiddies
**If this happened to you recently

3. **Do not mass downvote comments in hopes that you will win.** That's dumb and immature. If you see this happening in threads

4. **Request flair as soon as possible.** If you don't request flair and I find out, a simple screen shot of the PM of the key being sent or the window showing the gifted game will do.

5. **Stop making multiple request threads of the same game in less than a 24 hour time span.** It's spammy. I will delete all your request threads if I see this happening and give you warning. 


That's all for today.

Do upvote post for visibility since the subreddit is moving very quickly with the influx of requests.

Same shit different day.

As with the other days, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day four's daily deals:

ANNO 2070

Saints row: the third

Super Street Fighter IV

Chivalry: Medieval Warfare

Carrier Command: Gaea Mission

Portal Bundle

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be off the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Tell me your steam ID

3: Tell me your favorite TV show

That is all the information I need from you.

Rules:

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

*""More what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules."" - Captain Barbosa*


---


* 1.  Don't be a stranger.

An active

It also helps if you provide a link to your Steam account in your request post to make it easier for gifters to find you. 


* 2.  Give and take.

You should probably give something before you get something.  Things you can give do not necessarily need to be of monetary value.  Reddit is a big place.  Check out other subreddits, *give* an opinion or wish someone well.  I'll always check a person's post history before I consider fulfilling a request, and these are some of the things I look for.  

Also, I will ignore their request and go to the next one.

If you want to receive from the community


* 3.  Less is *not* more.

We often see request posts that consist of only a few lines and, as a gifter, to look at them for more than a minute (which is probably about the same amount of time it took for someone to write them).  If you're asking for a game, I want to know (in some detail) *why* you want it, why you can't get it yourself and why I should gift it to you.  No need for a sob story, but a good explanation would suffice.  At the very least, put up a small paragraph detailing your reasons.  I'd recommend constructing your request by covering things like why you think you'll enjoy the game, have you played any similar games


* 4.  Game on.

If you are fortunate enough to win a giveaway or have a request fulfilled, I would be rather disappointed.  I am sure other gifters feel the same.  I'm also going to sneak the word 'coffee' in here to see if people actually read this far, and if you are entering my giveaway use it as part of your request, but don't make it obvious, so I know you've read this.  If someone has a 'grabbed' flair and they've put up a request for another game, I would advise all potential gifters to check on the play time of their previously grabbed game(s).  Nobody wants to waste a gift on someone who's not going to get much out of it. 

If you are gifted a game


* 5. Wheaton’s Law.

Look it up

If you get gifted, I expect to see a number of 'thanks' posts equal to the number of their grabbed flair.


---


Again, guarantee that your request will be fulfilled.  You may meet all these criteria and still not get gifted, or you may meet none of them and your request could get fulfilled anyway (just not by me).   

Please do not reply to this post asking for games


Thanks for reading :)

**I will be notifying them shortly and then putting up day 3.**



So here the deal, sorry no flash deals since time doesn't permit that. This offer will end around noon the next day, central time zone, or when ever i wake up if it is in the afternoon, and then the next days giveaway will be put up. So this stays visible for as long as possible please upvote this post, since it is a self post i will not get any karma for it.

Day two daily deals:

**Tom Clancy's franchise** (there is more then one game in this daily deal make sure you pick one from it. **Also see rule 0 please.**)

**Psychonauts**

**F.E.A.R**

**Simcity 4**

**Dishonored**

**Darksiders franchise** (there is more then one game in this daily deal make sure you pick one from it.)

So what to do to win?

1: Tell me the game you want. Remember it has to be off the daily deals since they will run long enough for me to do this once a day with out having to buy each game ahead of time. You may only pick one game.

2: Tell me your steam ID

3: Show me your favorite picture/gif. It can literally be about anything and can be as SFW or NSFW as you want it to be. This is to keep me entertained while doing this.

That all the information i need from you.

Rules:

**0: A special rule for day 2

1: Reddit account has to be older then a month.

2: You can only pick one game.

3: I reserve the right to not give a game for any reason to anybody.

4: You agree to relinquish your soul to my custody.

5: While you can enter everyday I do one of these you can only win once. This is for fairness so as many people as possible can win.

6: Winners will be chosen however I like based on whatever i feel like choosing them on and is not first come first serve. So if i have not chosen a winner yet you can still enter.

Let me get this out of the way. I'm NOT rich

It all happened yesterday when I saw a SR3 request. After hitting up with the guy I found out I was 3 min late. Then it started. He told me he had a friend new to steam and he would like the game. If I didn't already put it in my innovatory

So I gave his friend: GTA 4 w/EFLC

I felt bad for the man who requested SR3 in the first place so I gave him:TWD w/400 days

I had fun gifting so I did it again. I saw a nice redditor that requested SMB. I gifted him that and: Bastion, causing his wishlist to be empty.

I did it again. This time giving SD. When we where talking I couldn't give him the game because it was in my innovatory (I was on mobile app) so I sent him Castle Crashers (it was on his wishlist) 

And the last gift I sent (as of now) was something special. I call it ""The Birthday To Remember"" (pretty cheesy) but a brother wanted to give his brother a b-day gift. The gift was Garry's Mod. If you didn't catch on

I felt more happy then I ever did gifting these games. Thank you!

EDIT:I forgot 1 more thing. I gifted a another redditor TWD:400 Days. I need to fix that to make it so I gifted him 2 or 4 games.    

EDIT 2: Another redditor added me as a friend just cause

EDIT 3: I HAVE BAD MEMORY. I gifted a redditor which is in my steam friends list GTA 4 w/EFLC because it was in his wishlist and I gave the redditor which was only given 400 days (I'm sorry) Payday: The Heist (it was the only thing is his wishlist)

/u/TheDancinOat is an alt account of /u/Pipboy111 who was banned for attempting to trade a game that he was gifted here in /r/GiftofGames. He made a request for any game and a kind user gifted him a game but he had not intention of playing the game he received even though he asked for anything. If he didn't want anything he should not have requested anything and should have asked for a game he actually wanted which he could have received.

He made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1536j4/requeststeam_its_my_birthday_may_i_have_some/) requesting any game because it is his birthday. He asks for anything but the last time he asked for anything

I would recommend going to his Steam account http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040576530 and ""block all communication"" to avoid adding and gifting this user in the future should he return to /r/GiftofGames with a new account.

Ultimately, why, and how you gift is up to you, so if you don't care who you gift to, it is ok too. Give to whoever and however you want. I am only providing my own suggestion if you want to make sure your gift doesn't go to waste. 

Certainly games you received for free or in $1 bundles or those you just want to get rid of aren't worth much to you so it doesn't matter too much who you give to

However

So you may consider reading some posts/comments by the Redditor to make sure they seem like someone you'd like to gift to and that they are active and contributing members on Reddit and not someone here for free games or here for a day and never heard from again once they get their game. 

There's no fool proof way to identify scammers but I would recommend having your own minimum criteria what to look at when giving if you're looking for someone who is deserving of your gift. 

___


**Link a screenshot showing you blocked this user or anyone on the Shared Ban List (like someone banned from /r/giftofgames) in this thread and I will enter you in a raffle to win a copy of Don't Starve. This will show me you read, I'll give you another game of equal value that you don't have.) I will choose two winners randomly sometime this Friday/Saturday.**

winner #1: /u/Detekzette42
winner #2: /u/Bubbadog12
___

If you actively give here, those banned from /r/GiftofGames.

When you look at the Steam profile of blocked users

Note, etc..


Be cautious when receiving or asking for PMs. Banned users from /r/giftofgames cannot post here but may still send PMs and some users may still lurk for chances to get free games from giveaways where gifters asked to be sent PMs or post game keys publicly.

If you believe someone may be a scammer or trying to scam games here
___

**EDITS**

**I know long post so I decided to giveaway more of my left over keys if you're interested** which I'll randomly giveaway since you took time to read this post I hope. You just have to post which key you want from the list below and don't have to block anyone if you don't want to.

*This giveaway is separate from the Don't Starve giveaway so asking for a key will not affect your chance of winning Don't Starve and vice versa. You must provide a link showing you blocked someone from the shared banned list by Friday to be entered in the raffle for a copy of Don't Starve*

Minimum requirement is an active Reddit account at least month old to prevent people creating new accounts to get a game in a giveaway. Asking for more than 1 key is ok but don't try to be greedy or you might not get anything and I would suggest mentioning why you are asking for that specific game. 

If you already posted something here

flair updates",3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/13pb08/announcement_rules_updates_warnings_policy_and/,"Ok guys, so a few updates on our rules.

* **New warning policy**

Firstly

Based on the situation, excessive or repeated trolling/harassment, using racial or prejudiced slurs, etc. Informal warnings will be given for lesser things, especially if it seems the user doesn't realize s/he is breaking our rules.

A second warning may not be given before a ban if the same rule is broken twice For example

We definitely don't want to have a heavy hand on the banhammer

--------

* **Harassment/trolling and appropriate conduct**

It seems that lately there has been a lot of harassment and trolling going on in the subreddit recently. It's a little disappointing that we need to bring this up

There are no requirements for requesting an item. You do not have to be low on cash or hard on your luck; it is completely up to the giver who gets an item. It is perfectly fine to call out a scammer

**You are always free to ask a user to prove their story.** If they feel uncomfortable doing so publicly

As a side note

------

* **Encouraging pirating**

While downloading games may not be illegal in certain countries, the post will be removed.

------

* **Using multi accounts**

Please keep in mind that using multiple accounts to get around our flair rules will result in an immediate ban of the multi. Using throwaway accounts to troll will also result in an immediate ban of the throwaway. It IS ok to use throwaway accounts regarding personal matters if the poster does not want the community to know their usual account

------

* **Flair updates**

Firstly

As of 11/28

------

* **Trading games**

A couple things in this category. Most importantly

We've also seen some posts where a user offers an item, we ask you just make two separate threads for them.

------

**Keep in mind that everyone is entitled to use the report link at the bottom of any post or thread if you feel a posting is inappropriate or breaks our rules.** We will definitely try to be proactive with keeping an eye on posts

Keys I have:

 Capsized (51-100)
 Awesomenauts (101-131)
 Awesomenauts Cluck Costume (132-150)
 Intrusion 2 (151-200

All you have to do is say which game you want (you can list up to two of them) and guess a number within the numbers given for each game above. Whoever is closest gets the game. If two people tie somehow then it will be the first poster.

You have three days until this is over.

Edit: A lot of people are actually guessing really close and two have guessed the exact number for two of the games. If all games end up having the exact number guessed for it I will close it early.

Edit 2: I posted a comment but I'll post it here as well... Awesomenauts has been guess correctly and so has Little Inferno. So you can guess for them but it's not going to do much. I won't announce winners until this is complete. The cluck costume


This has finished as of right now 11:55 PM 6/17/13 the winners will be announced here and messaged to have them send me their steam profile. If they do not respond within 24 hours I will choose the next closest guesser!

Little Inferno: 32 Good job Davidkones for guessing the correct number! You were one of the first guessers too

Capsized: 84 No one actually guessed the right answer for this so congratulations to SmurfUnivurf for guessing closest! ^ ^

Awesomenauts: 111 I'm sooo sorry! Three of you guessed the correct number and I feel horrible but as I stated it would be the first who guessed it right so congratulations to Kenkai for guessing it right first! ^ ^

Cluck Costume: 145 Congratulations to Etteface for guessing closest ^ ^

Intrusion 2: 196 This came really close for a while and then earlier today Jeraldpunx11 guessed it correctly so good job! ^ ^

Hello Reddit

Yesterday I did a [review](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/15z115/gog_free_games_for_playing_games_review_and_link/) on a website called Tremorgames (a website where you play games and fill surveys to get points)

Here's my proof it works:

~~**-Indie Game the Movie**~~

~~**-Offspring Fling**~~

~~**-Eversion**~~

~~**-Snapshot**~~

I know this applies to a small subset of people
So! Last night I experienced a conversation from a complete stranger that left such a bad taste in my mouth that I felt the urge to post about it here. And to clarify

It is not appropriate to tell your Steam friends to friend invite me to their friend list and ask/beg me games (or make new scam accounts pretending to be your Steam friends). I am in fact not rich

Anyways

* When requesting
* Your library can not be barren (or just have 1-2 unplayed games). Have at least 10 bought games or something. And be a gamer
* Your total played time can not be less than 30 hours. It will come off a little greedy and unappreciative if you hardly played anything and you are here on this subreddit with grabby hands.
* Use some common sense: Do not ask for more games than you deserve. Be honest and do not lie about playing some game together with me when I ask who you are.

I doubt the people that should read this are going to

1373505670.0,1i1suk,[GOG] Current Affairs of Flairs (and other things),komse,12,1,8,"Hey guys!

As you know

Over the next couple days

That said

1. Please do not resend flair requests for giveaways/grabbed from over a month ago. This will confuse me and give me more items to look through. You may even become double marked on accident. In the event that you believe you've been marked a double grabbed drop me a PM or drop a mod mail.

2. If your flair is still incorrect, you can also do your part in assisting me by including all your GoG thank threads and the giveaways you won at. Some of you have over hundreds of posts and I don't really have the time to shift through all of them.

3. If you run giveaways in other subreddits (i.e. /r/randomactsofgaming and /r/playitforward) those will not count towards your flair. They're a separate subreddit and community. It just doesn't work like that. This also goes for grabbed counts as well. So

And finally

1. [REQUEST] Threads should always be followed by the platform of the game you're requesting. A lot of users seem to be forgetting to add the PC/Steam, and etc. flairs. While it may not be a big deal for you, it does keep things much orderly and saves individuals time by not having to guess what platform the game is wanted on.

2. **NO BEGGING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S REQUEST THREADS.** This is UNACCEPTABLE behavior on all forms. I am appalled to see other users posting in someone else's request while it's being fulfilled asking the giver if *they have another copy to give out.* That is begging even if it is subtle. If the giver does not actively contact you then don't bother asking. This can discourage others in fulfilling requests as they'll be met with beggers. While the number of users doing this is small
