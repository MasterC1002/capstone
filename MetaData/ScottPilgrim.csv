The first time I saw Scott Pilgrim was when the movie cane out. Seeing the trailer made it look like an awesome movie (which it was) so I had to see it. After I saw the movie, and found my school's library had some of the Scott Pilgrim books. So I read the first one and was instantly hooked. I read all the books (Volume 4 is my fav) and I got the game soon after. The game was also amazing. Then I found out about this Subreddit,and my jaw dropped. A whole Subreddit dedicated to Scott Pilgrim!? Sweet! All I can say is thank u Reddit, thank you.

1365569330.0,1c1lmc,Something I put on my blog awhile ago...,NathanielWeber,26,8,1,"First post! I just joined reddit about a month ago, so I'll just copy/paste it here to see what you guys think!:)

Ok, why they are the way they are, and we love them, or love to hate them. So I'm gonna do this thing, where I analyze some of my very favorite characters. And if you have one you want me to do, message me! If I know the character, I will do it. If I don't I will see if I can research him/her and then do it (no promises!). So I'm gonna start this new little experiment with one of my all time favorite characters. His name is Scott Pilgrim.

 

Let me start buy saying if you haven't read the comics or watched the movie, Scott is so profoundly ORDINARY. Sure, he may be the ""best fighter in all the territories"" and the ""hero"" (definitely debatable) but here we've got a geeky, high-schooler dating, bass playing, jobless, boyfriend fighting 22 year-old who mooches off his friends, and virtually anyone who comes into contact with him. And despite all of this, our Luke Skywalkers, and get the girl with no sweat

 

Which is another great thing about Scott. For those of you who don't know the story, the hip American delivery girl, must first defeat the League of Evil Exes, all sworn to prevent Ramona from ever finding love again. Here we have two characters who despite their imperfections, find romance. And I think that message is quite a refreshing one. Love can be found for everyone. It's not just for the fairy tale prince and princess. Even the average Joes, they flawed and sometimes that downright crappy people can find it. But for Scott, this won't come until Ramona's Seven Evil Exes have been defeated. I think that behind the video-game boss like fights is a pretty classic piece of symbolism. With each evil ex, the first evil ex, and after defeating this evil ex he begins to take a bit more responsibility. Lucas Lee symbolizes Scott's insecurity about his geekiness. Scott frequently feels that he doesn't deserve Ramona (and he is sometimes right) because he isn't rich, and that is a nerd

Quite a franchise I must say. Well, ""Everything does not suck!"" Keep on keeping on!

Please excuse any grammar/spelling mistakes!:) It's a long summary! I'll get around to fixing them!",self,t5_2seyg,False,,scott,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1c1lmc/something_i_put_on_my_blog_awhile_ago/
