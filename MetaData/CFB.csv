This sub is growing rapidly and is currently approaching 50

* There is no real test, and lack of ""karma-grab"" content. This is objective and varies from mod to mod, but I think gives a general idea of what we look for **Example:** a pic of a teams new helmet is on it's face cfb related, possibly thought provoking considering the reports on uniforms having large affects on recruiting etc. and is 50/50 on the karma grab analysis. This it normally left to user downvote/upvote. HOWEVER, Pic of old Mascot is only possibly on it's face related(depending on what the mascot looks like and image title), not likely to promote thoughtful discussion, and seems heavily karma-grab like. These posts are normally removed. 

* Memes, if you have an idea such as ""old mascots"", a self-post thread where everyone can post images of their old mascots is likely to be allowed to live if people are upvoting it. The main page is meant to be an uncluttered space with many stories and ideas represented. 

* **USE THE REPORT BUTTON**: The easiest way to let the mods know about something is to report it. Reposts, message us to let us know what's going on. We don't see everything, but if it's reported it shows up to the mods.

* **YOU** have the power. The biggest thing to remember is that you have the power to upvote and downvote as well as report content. The content that makes the front page is dictated by the posts you upvote. The mods are very attentive to the report button

Hello Reddit

**I am Mike Leach the new Head Football Coach of Washington State University (GO COUGS!)**

I hear you guys are a fun group to host a Q&amp;A so here I am.

Before Washington State I was Head Coach of Texas Tech University where I never had a losing season and went to 10 bowl games in 10 years and currently hold the record for most wins at that program. 

Besides being a Head Football Coach I am also the author of New York Times Best Seller: [“Swing Your Sword”](http://www.amazon.com/Swing-Your-Sword-Leading-Football/dp/0983337195/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336396645&amp;sr=8-1) that I co-wrote with Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports.  It’s a book about my experiences as a coach as well as the lessons I have learned in life along the way.  

In addition to that book I am also the co-editor of [“Sports for Dorks: College Football Volume 1”](http://www.amazon.com/Sports-For-Dorks-College-Football/dp/0615484972/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336396685&amp;sr=8-1) which is a series of books that bring together great minds to talk about College Football in different unconventional ways.  [The official blog](http://www.sportsfordorks.com/) run by co-editor Ferhat Guven always has interesting topics being discussed.  We will have 2 more books coming out this fall; another on college football and one on the NFL.

I always get asked about where to get the cool [Team Leach Pirate Flags](http://www.teamleach.org/) so here’s where you can get those.   All proceeds go to my scholarship fund to help students pay for school. We’ve already given away 10k last year and will do it again this year.

~~**I’ll be back at 12:00 PM Pacific to answer your questions.**~~  I can’t talk about any recruits or anything that would violate NCAA rules

**GO COUGS!**

**Swing Your Sword!**

**-Mike Leach**



**Oh one more thing.** If you guys are interested there is a contest going on for the ESPN TV show College Gameday to film a commercial at the school with the most votes.  We are currently in 3rd place and are about 40, or maybe you are just a really popular person with 39,999 friends, but it really would be great for us to win; every vote helps and is appreciated.  The show has never been to our campus so it would be a really big deal for us to win!

You can [vote here](http://www.gamedayvote.com/).  (It Requires a Facebook Login) just click on the Pac-12 conference and we are the one with the cool cougar head in crimson that looks like he’s about to take a bite out of somebody.

**Hey guys this has been really fun
Thank you all so much for all the great questions! I wish I had more time to answer more

Props to /u/RarelyCoherent for the images

Anticipating a few questions you might have:

* **Is this permanent?** Maybe.  Depends on if people like it or not! Consider it to be on a trial basis for now.
* **Can you get rid of the yellow box that appears when I hover over the downvote flag?** Nah. There was a box there before
* **Why did you pick these images? I liked &lt;another image&gt; much better!** This suggestion was highly upvoted in the request thread
* **I love it!/I hate it!** That is not a question, and you won't hurt my feelings telling me it sucks.

A lot of people graciously create game highlight videos for YouTube. What they don't realize is that we can't tell what's happening when you show the zoomed in replay angles, people will likely find them and hope to see memorable plays as they happened. When they hit play and hear ""LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR"", they'll likely become frustrated and close the video.

If you're making a highlights video this fall after a game ends, etc. If you're taking the time to capture video, edit, upload, etc, if you do it the right way, you'll receive a lot of positive comments, and I'll do my best to edit together my highlights as they happened so as to not be a hypocrite.",t5_2qm9d,True

This contains coaching changes, rule changes, guide to all the bowl games, and a way-too-early Heisman watch. (The missing conference realignment page has been replaced).

A note about the bowl games - The numbers correspond to the order the bowl committee gets to pick from that conference, but Michigan finished third, or even fourth. The Capital One Bowl could still pick Michigan over Northwestern, knowing that the Wolverine fan base is much larger and will draw in a larger crowd, and therefore a higher profit. This is something I never really understood until recently, and I thought I'd pass it along. Feel free to correct any details I have wrong.

**Live Mascot:** None, on the sidelines they have a man in a [wolf suit that looks like it was picked up from the “Generic Wolf Aisle”](http://i.imgur.com/mobdJLf.jpg). Maybe they picked a cool name for him it would make—it's *“Wolfie”*? That's all you could come up with?   Laaaaaaaaaaaaame...Someone get them a fish suit.

*Rivals*
***
Kind of a mishmash
 
* [](/liberty) **Liberty**: really far away

* **Hofstra**: This one made sense because they're both on Long Island. Only problem is the rivalry ended in 2008 when Hofstra dropped football. I want to imagine it's because they were so savaged by the Seawolves that they signed some kind of formal surrender where they agreed to dismantle their football program and salt the field—but no: it's revenge by Dark Lord Baal for the school's insolence. They were the Flying Dutchmen until 2004, cutting edge Pride that would give them fabulous costumes and the most outrageous, beat-thumping half time shows on earth. They went for a generic pair of lions. Seriously: Fuck Hofstra.  

* [](/albany) **Albany**: Scooby-Doo/Marmaduke over here appears to be their natural rival going into the future: both are SUNY schools, Albany holds the 11–5 edge.

*The Greats*    
****
**Greatest Games:** 

* September 29, in front of horrified fans, [ground Army into a fine paste before smoking them 23-3.](http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=322730349) This was Stony Brooks' only victory against an FBS foe in 5 attempts, but damn... Even Captain America shed a tear after that one.  The Middies... not so much. [](/troll)

[](/kiffin) **“Clearly these guys hate America.”**

* 2012 @Syracuse: Stony Brook jumped to a first half lead but eventually lost to the Orange in the Carrier Dome. The previous season they took UTEP to OT before losing. Clearly the Seawolves can hack it.

[](/kiffin) **“Oh c'mon—even *I* beat Syracuse last season!”**
  
**Greatest Plays:**

* Entering “Greatest plays in Stony Brook football history” into YouTube found [this doozy of a pass from the 2011 season that managed to make the ESPN Top-10 Plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlrmhdWpsME)

**Greatest Players:**

* **Miguel Maysonet**: *See above*. 

* Things are thin after that. I googled the people in their Athletic HOF who played football

**Greatest Coaches:**

* **Chuck Priore**: The current coach started in 2006, winning conference titltes in his last four years (going a perfect 32-0 over the course of his final three). After three seasons hovering around .500 at Stony Brook, he started to see progress: the '09 and '10 squads both went 6-5 but were both 5-1 in conference and tied for the conference title. The '11 squad went 9-4, won the conference outright with a perfect 6-0, and lost in the second round of the FCS tourney with a ranking of No. 18. The 2012 squad went 10-3, 5-1 in conference (thanks to Turner Gill), tied for the conference title and again lost in the second round of the FCS tourney but with a rank of No. 10. Clearly this man is a candidate for a FBS program with a demonstrated track record of success. 

* **Sam Kornhauser**: From 1984 to 2005, Stony Brook did not offer football scholarships. He is now Director of Athletics Advancement and Alumni Relations at the school.

* **Unknown**: Prior to 1984, enigmatic unknown coach. 

****
*Traditions*
****
* I can't find any serious traditions. The main schools “athletic traditions” page just lists the school name

[](/kiffin) **“batlh potlh law' yIn potlh puS!”**

***
*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***
**City Population:** 13
[**City Skyline**](http://i.imgur.com/tO2UlIB.jpg)   
**Iconic Campus Building:** 

* **[Charles B. Wang Center](http://i.imgur.com/XVFXPDF.jpg)**, throbbing with ideas that course through its veiny, extended student body. 

[](/kiffin) **“Penis.”**

* [**Stony Brook University Hospital**](http://i.imgur.com/O7nID8I.jpg) is also kind of cool in how it looks like hub of some kind of authoritarian/dystopian future government. 
  
**Local Dining:** 
After creeping some college forums it sounds like there aren't any particularly iconic spots next to campus

* **Station Pizza &amp; Brew** is apparently the best of mediocre options. Pizza

* Since there's apparently a [Stony Brook Manhattan campus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_Manhattan), a top rating by Zagat, and placement in the top three restaurants in the world. Not really a traditional student budget, but NY and Long Island is full of trust fund children so the ~$300 prix-fixe shouldn't be too much of a problem (from my own experience with restaurants of this caliber, it's closer to $500 per person with drinks, tip, etc—budget accordingly). 

***
*Random Trivia*
***

* In terms of famous alumni, and reviled wacko Laura Schlessinger.

* Stony Brook helps manage and operate the [Brookhaven National Laboratories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratories)

* Stony Brook scientists have invented such groundbreaking technologies as the virtual colonoscopy!

[](/kiffin) **“I think I'll pass on testing that VR helmet...”**

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
**Stony Brook fielded a football team in 2012 and, making it to the NCAA tournament second round, but their all-everything running back just graduated and has monstrous shoes to fill as they head into their first season in the Colonial Athletic Conference. Still, there are several all-conference players returning and a talented coach who has yet to be stolen by a bigger program, so anything is possible. 

***
*Overtime*
***
[](/kiffin) **“Brony U is an ugly campus with ugly cheerleaders and students who didn't give enough fucks to actually write this damn thing. *Fuck* Hofstra.”**

First off

With the season in full swing we've been growing in size each and every week; for the last seven weeks we've been averaging over 1

Inevitably with the growth in size has come the need to make a few adjustments in terms of how we moderate content. Our goal is not to censor any particular messages or fanbases, to breaking news, to trash talk, etc. In order to facilitate all of this, we've begun trying to filter quick content which has a tendency to overwhelm ours and other subreddits into weekly threads, as you may have noticed. The goal of the threads is to give everything a place so that we can cater to everyone including those who want to discuss the ins and outs of college football as well as those who just want to have a quick laugh.

We've also noticed somewhat of a pick-up lately in terms of fighting between fanbases and conferences and just in general users taking things too far. We as mods try to handle situations when we see them

We still think we can do better.

**So

* First off
* **Post content which better belongs in a thread in that thread.** Memes go in the meme thread. If you have a highlight image or video on gameday
* **Make sure to check the /new/ page and search before posting something
* **Be civil.** One of the big reasons why we're able to have conversations here is thanks to keeping the out-and-out name-calling and personal attacks down to a minimum. Just because someone sports your rival's flair doesn't mean they can't be rational in their discussions.
* **Vote based on quality and not agreement.** Don't vote on a post just because of the flair or because you agree/disagree with an argument. Even if you disagree with what someone has said
* **Report posts which are more appropriate in a weekly thread.** If something has been reported we can usually respond to it much faster.  
* **Report posts and comments which break our rules, flamebait, or personal information.** We can't be everywhere, but if it gets reported one of us will look at it. If you believe you're being unwarrantably attacked by another user, don't attack back, just report it and we'll take care of it.

Finally, especially on the weekend when we have the most traffic and posts. Our ideal candidate has time to help during gameday, is a long time user, and has experience moderating before, though anyone who thinks they'd be a good fit is encouraged to apply.

To apply

**Nickname:** Wolverines

Although wolverines have never been native to Michigan, that the name resulted from the large amount of fur trading that took place in Michigan’s early days, second, that the name was invented by Native Americans comparing the rate at which settlers grabbed land to the notoriously gluttonous wolverine, or third, that the name was originally an insult hurled at Michiganders by Ohioans during the Toledo War of 1835-1836 (this is the most commonly accepted explanation). In any case, students of the University of Michigan have been known as Wolverines since at least 1861.

**Live Mascot:** None. No guy in a costume

In 1927, as Yost noted, “*it was obvious that the Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were by no means friendly.*""

**Band:** [The Michigan Marching Band](http://i.imgur.com/XHX6u.jpg)

The MMB was founded in 1896 and began playing at football games in 1898. William D. Revelli, the band will feature 340 members who must go through the band week tradition of learning/relearning marching fundamentals as well as the large amount of music that the band plays every year known as “traditionals”.

The band does all rehearsals on Elbel field, author of *The Victors*. During the season only 235 members make it into the performance block for pregame each week via a “challenge” system. Those who don’t make it in will still rehearse, march to the stadium, attend the game and play in the stands, but they wait in the stands while the rest of the band performs pregame and halftime.

The band performs at all home games and travels to away games in South Bend, the MMB is credited with inventing Ohio State’s most famous tradition, the “Script Ohio.”](http://imgur.com/KDmGWbU)

The MMB was the first collegiate marching band to receive the Sudler Trophy, unlike most of the college football landscape at the moment, the vast majority of music played at Michigan Stadium is band-provided and “piped-in” music was only added in the last few years.

[Here’s a pretty great video of the MMB’s entire pregame routine during the 2011 “Under the Lights” game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QfGEAKHbM)

Outside of that context, *the Hawaiian War Chant* almost universally follows the playing of *Temptation* with the announcer and crowd declaring “You can’t have one without the other!”). Also of note is *I Can’t Turn You Loose* (the Blues Brothers song), [which is played to pump up the student section](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVEMQri6uuAE) entering the fourth quarter of football games, the third period of hockey games, and the final stretch of basketball games.

“The Big House” has an official capacity of 109, every game has been attended by at least 100,000 spectators--a streak of over 200 games.

Opened with an initial capacity of just 82, paving the way for expansions that continue to this day. Because Michigan Stadium is built into the ground, [it has a relatively low profile](http://www.public-art.umich.edu/the_collection/images/full/216)--deceiving people into underestimating its size from the outside. According to legend, during the stadium’s construction a construction crane sank into the sand beneath the field, where it remains to this day.

Since 1955

Michigan Stadium has also hosted outdoor hockey games including [The Big Chill at the Big House](http://multimedia.detnews.com/pix/c5/6d/17/84/51/b9/20101211200052_2010-1211-dg-bigchill0929.jpg) (Michigan beat MSU 5-0)

*Rivals (in chronological order)*

***

[](/notredame) **Notre Dame Fighting Irish (Michigan leads
 
“*To Hell with Notre Dame!*” -Bo

Michigan’s football relationship with Notre Dame began in 1887 when Michigan’s team made their way down to South Bend to literally teach Notre Dame how to play football. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Although Michigan and Notre Dame initially started on good terms, but blackballing them from their schedules as well. Struggling to find games in the midwest, Notre Dame turned to scheduling games on the [East Coast](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/899/957/NavyNotreDame_display_image.jpg?1304047976) and [West Coast](http://www.fillio.com/blog/nd/files/bush_push.jpg) instead.

In 1947, however, a special AP re-vote was convened with Michigan being declared the champion. To this day, both schools claim the 1947 championship.

By the time the series started back up in 1978, in 2012 Notre Dame exercised an opt-out clause in the scheduling contract and the rivalry is being paused indefinitely after 2014.

Some great moments: [Desmond Howard's diving 4th down catch in 1991](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfJA3sJawFaY) and the entire [“Under the Lights”](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVBmCew7PbyQ) game in 2011.

[](/chicago) **University of Chicago Maroons (Michigan leads

Long before Ohio State joined the Western Conference/Big Ten, the heated rivalry boiled over at many points on and off the field. In 1905, Chicago dealt Yost his first loss as Michigan’s coach when Michigan player Denny Clark was tackled for a safety, the only score of the game. The mistake would go on to haunt Clark for the rest of his life until he unfortunately committed suicide some years later.

Humiliated by the loss and fearing that Stagg would use his superior position to institute rules to Michigan’s detriment, Michigan turned to regularly scheduling fellow independents Michigan Agricultural College (later MSU) and Ohio State University, effectively beginning our rivalries with both. 

The teams last met in 1939

[](/minnesota) **Minnesota Golden Gophers (Michigan leads

In 1903, Yost sent for an assistant to buy a water jug from a nearby store for his team to use. Michigan led 6-0 for most of the game in front of a raucous crowd until Minnesota finally scored to tie the game with two minutes left, causing the crowd to storm the field and the game to be called early as a 6-6 tie. In the ensuing pandemonium, Michigan left the field and the jug was left behind, where it was claimed by Minnesota’s athletic department. From there Michigan and Minnesota mutually decided that the jug would be a suitable trophy for future rivalry games, making the [Little Brown Jug](http://www.annarbor.com/assets_c/2011/09/BROWN-JUG-thumb-590x414-89350.jpg) one of the oldest rivalry trophies in American college football.

Initially the rivalry was pretty fierce. The contests between Michigan and Minnesota in the 1930s were especially important since both teams had national title hopes almost every year

[](/ohiostate) **Ohio State Buckeyes (Michigan leads

“*If you granted me just one more week as Michigan’s head coach

Michigan hates Ohio and Ohio hates Michigan. It’s not just a football thing, it’s not unheard of to drive hours out of your way to take a longer route so that your car doesn’t enter Ohio. At the very least, you’d better stop for gas at the last exit in Michigan.

In late November, but its importance on the college football landscape as well.  

The first time that these two schools played each other was in 1897 and the matchup has occurred 106 times. Prior to the addition of the Big Ten Championship game

The rivalry truly exploded during the “Ten Year War” between Bo and Woody starting in 1969, there is plenty of hope in Ann Arbor that the rivalry can be ours once again.

Some great moments: [1969](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvBKhgAiADLI%23t%3D5m54s) (more on that later), and [ending the streak.](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTB7NXdYDtBs)

[](/michiganstate) **Michigan State Spartans (Michigan leads

Michigan State has always had it out for Michigan, which was commonly regarded as the “Athens of the West” a few decades ago. When MSU and Michigan both played in Auburn Hills for this year’s NCAA Basketball Tournament, Michigan’s opponent South Dakota State saw their merchandise sales [quadruple](http://www.gooFgle.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbssports.com%2Fcollegebasketball%2Fblog%2Feye-on-college-basketball%2F21917977%2Fmsu-fans-buying-south-dakota-state-gear-to-wear-during-michigan-game&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfIo4Hn7O0iThmrFNsnMEch27AZQ) in part due to Michigan State fans buying SDSU stuff to cheer against us. 

The first game between the two schools took place in 1898 and they have played each other every year since 1910 (with a brief hiatus in the 1943 and 1944 seasons). The [Paul Bunyan Trophy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/PaulBunyanTrophy.jpg/250px-PaulBunyanTrophy.jpg) was introduced in 1953

Historically Michigan has dominated State in just about every sport, and a 145-125-19 lead in hockey, but in recent years quality MSU coaches like Tom Izzo and Mark Dantonio have evened out the rivalry significantly.

Some great moments: [Charles Woodson’s ridiculous 1997 interception](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdtFVMO8e9Fc)

*The Greats*

***

**Greatest Games:**

* **[1902 Rose Bowl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/1st-Rose-Bowl-game-1902.jpg) (Michigan 49
* **1934 Michigan v. Georgia Tech (Michigan 9, a Michigan student at the time, was heavily involved and wrote an article in the school newspaper regarding the affair, including the death threats made to Ward by some of the Georgia Tech players. Gerald Ford, the team’s star center and Ward’s [close friend and roommate](http://media.mlive.com/wolverines_impact/photo/9324364-large.jpg), told his coach that if Ward didn’t play, he wouldn’t play. On game day, and Gerry Ford led Michigan to a 9-2 win in a heated contest in front of an angry Michigan Stadium crowd.
* **1945 Michigan v. Army at Yankee Stadium (Army 28, head coach Fritz Crisler invented a stunning new tactic to try and even the odds: the platoon system. A stunned TIME Magazine would write, “*Michigan plays one team on offense, one on defense...he gives his “offense unit” one kind of indoctrination, his “defense unit” the other. Crisler even has a “point-after-touchdown” unit--including a specialist place-kicker and seven of the biggest linemen on the squad.*” Although Michigan would go on to lose the game, it would mark the invention of the platoon system that is used today in every level of football.
* **1948 Rose Bowl (Michigan 49, Michigan’s spectacular performance against USC led to a special AP poll being held after the game in which voters awarded Michigan the national championship over Notre Dame. 
* **[1950 Snow Bowl](http://maizeandgoblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/UM-OSU-1950-Snow-bowl.jpg) (Michigan 9, and they almost canceled the game. The teams combined for 45 punts (often on first down), and Michigan won the game even though they had no first downs. They blocked a punt near the end zone for their only touchdown in this bizarre affair.
* **[The 1969 Game](http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/umosu/images/69celebl.jpg) (Bo 24, with Hayes purposely running up the score late in the game by going for two points “because I couldn’t go for three.”  The next season, the 1969 Ohio State Buckeyes were being hyped as the greatest college team of all time, with at least one publication saying that the only game worth watching all year would be OSU’s offense facing off against its defense in practice. With newly-hired head coach and former Hayes assistant Bo Schembechler at the helm, Michigan would pull off the upset to spoil Ohio State’s undefeated season and kick off ten years of Bo-vs-Woody rivalry matches that we refer to as “The Ten Year War.” At the time, this was considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of college football.
* [**The 1995, undefeated Ohio State visited Ann Arbor looking to keep their national championship hopes alive. Tim Biakabutuka was going to have none of that. He ran for 313 yards and led Michigan to a 31-23 win. In 1996 Ohio State was again undefeated, and Michigan beat them 13-9 in Columbus to ruin another perfect season. In 1997, the tables were turned, and Michigan was the undefeated team. Charles Woodson had a key interception in the endzone and returned a punt for a touchdown to keep Michigan’s national championship hopes alive with a 20-14 victory. Michigan would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Washington State to win its first national championship in nearly 50 years.
* **[2011 “Under the Lights”](http://www.michiganreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Michigan-stadium-night-game-52.jpg) (Michigan 35, heading into the fourth with a 24-7 lead. Led by Irish-slayer Denard Robinson, Michigan scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, only to see themselves down 31-28 with 8 seconds left to play. With noted Buckeye Kirk Herbstreit pleading for Brady Hoke to center the ball and kick a safe game-tying field goal, Michigan instead chose to go for it, scoring a game-winning touchdown with just two seconds remaining.  

**Greatest Plays:**

* It may not be a single play, two passing touchdowns, kicking four extra points, intercepting three passes, and punting three times for an average of 50 yards. At the end of the game, the Ohio State home crowd gave him a standing ovation.

The previous coaching staff, discouraged and bitter towards Auburn. I was ready to leave auburn, as were several teammates (teammates that would be integral to the 2010 National Championship run).
All of that changed the day Coach Chizik and his staff stepped on campus. We became students before athle
tes, and a family before a football team. He ""fixed"" the hearts and heads of young men that will go forward to be some of the greatest advocates and ambassadors Auburn has ever known. This, along with a national title and conference championship, will be his lasting legacy at Auburn.
I stood with Coach Chizik though grueling workouts and hellacious practices, Florida, after he and I and a handful of my teammates had the privilege of visiting with the patients for a few hours. He looked at me and said ""You know, Andrew, you can’t ever forget what’s most important in life.” He hasn’t forgotten. Neither have I. Thank you Coach.

**Greatest Coaches**:

*[Greg Schiano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M76jSUzXzxk)*

Despite being the birthplace of college football, and to try and mimic a Michigan or Cal of the east (balancing athletics &amp; academics). Our success first came in 2006 after that memorable Louisville win, that's when people said our investment 'paid off'. Ever since then we've been upgrading facilities for all sports, this why I think of us as a young program still. It seems that every year we're keeping more and more in state recruits since Schiano came to town. If we could keep it up, we can be a powerhouse just because we have enough in state talent to fill up our roster.

Breaking down Schiano's [record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Schiano#Head_coaching_record)

Pre-Schiano records: Dick Anderson 1984–1989 27–34–4 (.446)

2001-2005 record: 19-39 (.328)

2006-2011 record: 49-28 (.636)

Post Schiano era

(BTW our 2010 season was bad because that's when Eric LeGrand got paralyzed :/ and the morale of everyone on the team was down.)
Greg Schiano was able to so all this with the Big East brand and Big 
East dollars...hopefully we can capitalize on the groundwork he laid down with Rutgers.

*[Frank Burns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_R._Burns)*

The only coach to lead us to an undefeated season in 1976. He also led RU to the [greatest college football upset OF ALL TIME](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1190313-rutgers-10-greatest-d-i-victories-of-all-time-number-1) over Tennessee (according to Mark Bator of the bleacher report).

On the night of April 25, but Princeton had stolen it and placed it on their own campus. The Orangemen constantly taunted Rutgers with the cannon. Finally in 1875, Rutgersmen went to 
Princeton and returned at dawn with the cannon.

The story of the ""Cannon War spread throughout the nation's newspapers

Today the cannon is behind Nassau Hall on the Princeton campus. The cannon that stands in front of Old Queens was placed there by the Class of 1877 as a memorial of the event. To this day

*What Is and What is to Come*

***
2012 will go down as the year that could have been. It started off so well, although the best the team has ever made, was seen, rightfully, as a disappointing way to cap off a frustrating season for a team that looked as if it was finally going to take the proverbial next step and ascend onto the national playing field. The bowl was an accurate summation of the team’s season: gritty, aggressive defense and an offense that was so bad that stagnant would be an overstatement. The first play of the game the defense scored a touchdown, and for the next 59 minutes the offense only managed 3 points. As overtime came

Looking ahead to 2013, will begin to make its mark. Defensive leaders and likely first round picks Logan Ryan (CB) and Khaseem Greene (played a unique LB position known as the “R”) are gone, but have capable replacements in the wings. Look for Steve Longa to take over and put up gaudy numbers at the R and Tejay Johnson to step in at CB. The problem with all this change is that the team was carried by the defense last year. They will not, at least initially, have a similar luxury in 2013.

That brings us to the offense. The success of the offense is completely dependent upon the play of the QB. Gary Nova is likely to retain his role as starter, the other likely starting WRs, Miles Shuler, Leonte Caroo, and Ruhann Peele, were all 4* recruits as well) so a even semi-capable QB should vault this offense into a top 30 unit nationally. For this team to succeed, decent QB play is absolutely essential. 

Predictions below

Same Gary Nova as last year, and the defense is good but not good enough to carry the team like it did last year. Likelihood: 40%

Rutgers fans were left with a very disappointing season in 2012. It's not very often that you hear a fan base calling for the head of a first year of a head coach after going 9-3 in the regular season. Preseason predictions with Greg Schiano had us going 11-1 with a loss to Arkansas (lol) because of all the talent that was returning on defense. After Kyle Flood was promoted to head coach, but quickly came out of the woodwork after losing to Kent State. The second half of the year was a disaster, losing two games in a row 
which would have sent us to the BCS. Looking forward to the future

2013 is the most important year in the program’s history due to the upcoming move to the B1G. First, Logan Ryan, Scott Vallone, Brandon Jones, and Steve Beauharnis. The team must be ready to compete defensively and build momentum for the 2014 season.

On another front, Maryland, and Ohio already). I recommend you read Todd Hunt’s articles (www.nj.com/rutgersfootball) if you would like to follow the process, he does a great job.

Since we were up first

After two awful experiences with SEC fans(UF- Mich Cap One Bowl and MSU - Mich Gator Bowl) I went into this matchup with trepidation about Gamecock fans behavior; I couldn't have been more wrong. 

The tailgate was a mixed bag of SC and Mich fans in the parking lot, as Mich fans, were offered food and drink from many SC fans; that didn't happen at the prior two bowl games I mentioned.

During the game, the fans delivered; it was a wall of sound emanating from their endzone. The S-E-C chant after that first pick was a little annoying, though.

After the game, or threw liquor bottles at us(looking at you, Gator fans). We hung out in the parking lot waiting for the traffic to die down with a few Gamecock fans. I brought way too much food for the pre-game and handed it out liberally. The people were genuinely thankful and polite. 

The interaction with the SC fans made this gut-wrenching loss a little more tolerable. Thank you.

**TL;DR** Gamecock fans are a class act.

**EDIT** I forgot to mention the lovely ladies in sundresses and cowboy boots. Yowza.

**EDIT 2** I didn't mean for this to be an SEC bashing thread - I merely wanted to compliment the SC fans. The experiences I related were merely for context. **FULL DISCLOSURE** I will probably be attending UF in the fall.

FINAL EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the questions and support. This was my first experience with reddit and I appreciate you guys taking it easy on me...especially about football.  I also appreciate the many questions and concerns for my son, and any support that you guys could give us in spreading the word would be appreciated.

It reminded me of the sites that have write ups on one college team a day in the lead up to the season. I was thinking perhaps our subreddit could do something similar but with a little twist. Every week we could have a few threads in which a fan/fans knowledgeable about their team could give us kind of a 'get to know you' on their respective school. We could use it to learn about other school's most famous players, history


 
**edit** Someone decided to fill the Google Doc Spreadsheet with racial slurs and delete several things so I temporarily closed it while I got things figured out. I restored it to a previous version that should have everyone's names still. I don't know when the vandalism started though so I did my best guess. For now, or add your school to the list, please message me directly and I will edit the list myself.

**Marching Band:** [The Badger Band](http://i4.minus.com/jkFTXlFdBni8h.jpg), the Badger Band is a Wisconsin favorite. Their distinctive “Stop at the Top” marching step, unique to our band, is extremely strenuous and requires massive amounts of energy. [The Run-On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LEfMYfj1A) is the kick-off to their performance. They also perform the famous fifth quarter celebration after every game; during our periods of football ineptitude, fans would say they were only showing up for the band. They have been led since 1969 by [Mike Leckrone](http://imgur.com/OIDGCIo), who rides in to their spring concert every year in a different, ridiculous manner.

**Record:**[8-6](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/schedule/_/id/275/year/2012/wisconsin-badgers)

**Coach:** [Gary Andersen](http://i.imgur.com/z9uvvb1.jpg)

**Key Players:**

* Chris Borland (LB) - Short

* James White (RB) - Fast running back that hasn’t ever been the feature guy

* Melvin Gordon (RB) - Montee Ball said Melvin is more talented than he is. He’s amazingly fast, 216 yard outburst against Nebraska.

* Jared Abbrederis (WR) - Our only receiving threat that isn't a tight end. He’s fast, and is hard to tackle. He’s the latest in a long history of great walk-on players.

* The offensive line - Wisconsin breeds offensive linemen. They are the key to everything we do and they are our best asset.

**Biggest Plays:**

* [Montee Ball Stiffarm](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1818515/stiffgif.gif)

*The Greats*

****

**Greatest Games:**

* 1993 Rose Bowl win over UCLA

This is what most Badger fans view as the game that single-handedly brought us from a bottom dweller in the Big 10 to a team that deserved to be acknowledged.  Barry in a matter of 4 years had done what many thought impossible - he won a Rose Bowl with Wisconsin.

* 1998 Rose Bowl win over UCLA

Where Craig James said Wisconsin was the [worst team to ever play in a Rose Bowl](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324274404578211612240228242.html)

* 1999 Rose Bowl win over Stanford

With this win the Badgers became the first Big 10 team to ever win back-to-back Rose Bowls.

* 2003 Big 10 win over Ohio St. 17-10.

Wisconsin hosted then #3 Ohio St. - who at the time held the nation’s longest winning streak at 19 games.  With just under 6 minutes left backup quarterback Matt Schabert tossed a [79 yard bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4sLYNI2PLg) to a open Lee Evans, had to be taken out because OSU linebacker Robert Reynolds pushed his hand/fingers onto Sorgi’s throat, making Sorgi unable to speak.

* 2010 regular season win over #1 Ohio State

One of the best Camp Randall atmosphere’s I’ve ever experienced

* 2005 Paul Bunyan’s Axe win over #22 Minnesota

* [Every Big Ten Championship Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaCk5Fnnqk0) that has [ever happened.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8R26lY_QYc)

2011 vs. MSU and 2012 vs. Nebraska.

****

**Greatest Players:**

* **Ron Dayne:**

Holds the all-time NCAA rushing yards record at 6, Dayne is truly of the of all-time greats.  Also, when he came to UW he was 270 pounds, one of the main reasons he went to UW was because UW was one of the few (if only) schools that offered him at RB and not FB or DT/LB.

* **Dave Schreiner**

A two time All-American at end and member of the College Football Hall of fame.  Died in action in WWII.


* **Joe Thomas**

A 3-time starter at LT, and an very talented shot putter for the Wisconsin Badgers from 2003 - 2006.  Thomas now makes a living pushing people around for the Cleveland Browns as one of the best linemen in the NFL.


* **Alan “The Horse” Ameche:**

In 1954 was the first Badger to win a Heisman trophy, “The Greatest Game Ever Played”.

* **Elroy “Crazylegs” Hirsch:**

Great running back for UW/Michigan in the 1940s

* **Pat Richter:**

Badger legend.  9 time letterwinner (last to do so).  3 times each in football, first round draft pick to the Denver Broncos, served as athletic director from 1989 - 2004, and was largely responsible for the revolution of Badger athletics (hired Barry Alvarez, built the Kohl Center, renovated Camp Randall, etc.).

* **Lee Evans.**

Badger WR from 2000-2003, and 9 touchdowns, and in 2003 Evans had 64 rec, 1213 yards, and 13 touchdowns.  By the time he left UW, Evans was the leader or amongst the leaders in each category.  First round draft pick by the Buffalo Bills.

* **Montee Ball:**

Holds multiple records (tied for most touchdowns in a season: 39, most career rushing touchdowns: 77).  Won the Doak walker in 2012, Heisman candidate in 2011, and was a 2-time All-American (2011, 2012).  Was a HUGE factor in Wisconsin’s recent success in the B1G conference.

**Honorable mention**: Russell Wilson and JJ Watt

Both had only one notable year (Wilson because he was here for only one year



****

**Greatest Coaches:**


* **Barry Alvarez:**

Barry resurrected a moribund Badger football program in 1990 and continues to provide leadership for the entire athletic department to this day. He is best coach in Wisconsin history and it’s not even close. Alvarez’s record while at UW was 118-74-4 and was 8-4 in bowl games. While he roamed the sidelines

* **Bret Bielema.**

[“The chart says go for two.”]( http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/jack_mccallum/10/11/sportsmanship/index.html)

Although we are currently a little mad at Bret, Bielema continued the success that Alvarez had wrought and made Wisconsin into more of a national brand, but seemed to rub many of the Wisconsin faithful the wrong way. Throughout Bielema’s tenure, for every brilliant play-call [(see Brad Nortman’s fake punt against Iowa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKvOZueACjI) there were myriad boneheaded decisions that left fans searching for answers. It always seemed like Wisconsin was this close to something great only to come up short and, fair or not, that always comes back to the head coach.  

Fun fact: Only 1 starting left tackle under Bielema’s reign failed to win an Outland Trophy (Joe Thomas and Gabe Carimi won

**Greatest Rivalries:**

* [](/minnesota) - **Minnesota:** [Paul Bunyan's Axe](http://i.imgur.com/OQFczvh.jpg)/ [Slab of Bacon](http://i.imgur.com/O21wU6n.jpg). Minnesota leads series 58-56-8

The trophy is a symbol of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, while the Badgers lead the Axe series 38-24-3 with a current 9 game win streak.

The Paul Bunyan Axe was created by the Wisconsin letterwinners' organization (the National W Club) and would be instituted as the trophy in the series in 1948. The scores of each game are recorded on the axe's handle, they run to their own sideline, take the axe and carry it around the field. If the team not holding the trophy wins, they are allowed to run to their opponents' sideline and ""steal"" the axe away. Usually, after the winning team claims the axe, it is custom for the team to carry the axe to one of the goal posts and ""chop"" it down with the axe.

Previously the game was played for the “Slab of Bacon” trophy, it was presented to the winning school by a sorority from the losing school.

After the Gophers' 1943 victory, Dr. George Hauser, refused to accept it, stating he believed ""such trophies should be out for the duration"" (of World War II). The trophy disappeared and was replaced by Paul Bunyan's Axe in 1948.

The Slab of Bacon was missing until 1994

The Slab of Bacon is currently housed in the Wisconsin football office at Camp Randall Stadium. ""We took home the bacon


* [](/iowa) - **Iowa:** [Heartland Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/6pAOqZd.jpg). While this rivalry has been on hiatus for a couple years, when they defeated Wisconsin 30–7. In 2005, Iowa spoiled the last home game for Wisconsin head coach Barry Alvarez, defeating the Badgers at a rain-soaked Camp Randall Stadium, by a score of 20–10. The Badgers took possession of the trophy for the first time in 2006, defeating Iowa 24–21 in a back-and-forth affair. Wisconsin evened the Heartland Trophy series in 2007, winning another closely contested game 17–13, Iowa took the lead in the trophy series, look for this rivalry to only get more intense.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City Population:**

Madison: 236

[**City Skyline**](http://madisonwihotelhj.com/images/slide-1.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Buildings:**

* [Bascom Hall](http://i.imgur.com/vYzWoI1.jpg): Sitting atop the picturesque [Bascom Hill](http://imgur.com/MtqndhE)--which is a pain in the ass to walk up on your way to class--[Bascom Hall](http://imgur.com/k9bMU9B) is the main administration building on campus. None other than Abraham Lincoln sits in front of it—and the reason he’s there is a source of some confusion. Aside from the Republican Party (of which Lincoln was a member) being founded in Ripon, which is why his statue is on a campus that he never saw. Graduating seniors [sit on his lap](http://imgur.com/reWb9cK) and whisper their academic, career-based, or romantic hopes and dreams into his ear for the supposed good luck it brings. People often rub his foot for good luck. The hill itself has served as both a place for [orators to deliver speeches](http://imgur.com/ZvgReSE), and [a snowy battlefield](http://vimeo.com/8154855) among other things.

* [Union South](http://i.imgur.com/dB7j6iK.jpg): One of the newer buildings on campus, to a bowling alley, to a hotel, and it even has its own movie theater. Union South and Memorial Union are somewhat unique in that following the longstanding Wisconsin tradition, they are two of a select group of Union buildings where alcohol is served. Union South itself has two bars—one in “The Sett” and another adjacent to a coffee shop. It is also the greenest student union in the country; it is state-of-the-art in its energy-saving methods and much of the building materials were recycled from other buildings.

* [Memorial Union](http://i.imgur.com/3cfOXLw.jpg): Completed in 1928, as a state, was strongly influenced by German immigrants.) It also houses the Memorial Union theater and the gorgeous [Memorial Union Terrace](http://i.imgur.com/VGyODj1.jpg), an outdoor dining and drinking area known for its calming and spectacular [sunsets.](http://i.imgur.com/4VNizhg.jpg)

* [Wisconsin State Capitol Building](http://i.imgur.com/VKldsct.jpg): While not strictly on campus, and the fact that city regulations stating no building within a certain distance can be built taller than the dome are a near-guarantee that it can be seen from nearly anywhere on campus or in the city. The famous (or is it infamous?) [State Street leads up to the capitol building](http://i.imgur.com/5rwMZjL.jpg) and the [beautiful downtown area surrounding it](http://i.imgur.com/JMH93Gg.jpg). Atop the capitol stands the enigmatic [“golden lady”](http://i.imgur.com/I8lTPGQ.jpg), a figure of Athena who is holding an eagle, wearing a badger on her head (lol), and signaling “forward”--Wisconsin’s state motto, from which “On Wisconsin” is derived.


**Local Dining:**

* [Mickies Dairy Bar](http://i.imgur.com/BmS8L7q.jpg) is where you go for breakfast. It is delicious

* Beer is a food

* [Ian’s Pizza](http://ianspizza.com/) is a staple drunken stop for late night food.  A fantastic selection of unique pizzas at reasonable prices make it a fantastic place to swing after the bars.  They’re most known for their delicious [Mac n Cheese pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nSaOYsm.jpg).

* A walk down [State Street](http://i.imgur.com/SvV3QFA.jpg) provides a plethora of available resturants, everything coming from a Wisconsin brewery. The import list currently consists of one beer, Grainbelt, from neighboring Minnesota. It takes after its football team and is terrible.

*Random Trivia/ Traditions*

* [Jump Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHQMaxiOmg) is everyone’s favorite tradition. After the 3rd Quarter, everyone cheers, and then the crowd starts jumping. The tradition started in 1998 as just something to fill time and keep people excited, but the students went nuts so they kept playing it. In 2003, the AD Pat Richter said not to play the song due to structural concerns while Camp Randall was under construction. After thousands of letters, emails, and phone messages

* [The Fifth Quarter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjid0EA6K1c). After every game, or draw, the band goes on the field and puts on a postgame performance. The students know song-specific dances to everything the band plays, such as Tequila, a modified version of the “2001, a Space Odyssey” theme, Swingtown, of course, “F*** YOU!” and the rest of the students would reply “EAT SH*T!” This was the start of the infamous “ESFU” chant that the administration hates.

* [Varsity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4kxkiAJyI) - Varsity is our alma mater. The band plays it after their halftime performance and after games. Everyone in the stadium puts their arms around each other and sings

* Piped-in Music: The student section will sing along to anything the sound guy puts on. Favorites are Sweet Caroline,” and, of course, [Build Me up Buttercup](www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-zFr1WA0ZU). (Full version [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnYCdKDI5hk)). The singing never ends when the music stops.

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

2012 was a strange year for Wisconsin. We suffered through six defeats and massive turmoil. It started after the first two games, a graduate assistant, took over, and soon had the line back to old form. After our loss at Nebraska, the season was pretty easy to predict - If you could match up with our offensive line, you had a very good chance of winning, and probably did (MSU, PSU, Indiana

We went through 3 starting quarterbacks; Joel Stave took over after Danny O’Brien showed that he had the pocket presence of a jellyfish. After Stave broke his collarbone, respectively, for long runs. In all seriousness, the dude looked like he turned into Johnny Unitas for two-minute drills late in regulation against Ohio State and Penn State.

Finally

While we lost 6 games, and lost those 6 games by a combined 26 points. 3 of the games were in overtime. Wisconsin was not as bad as 8-6 seems.

**2013 Season**

2013 is a very, unlike last year, the offensive line scheme is the same, which is a huge relief for all Badgers. While we return many starters, we lose all-time NCAA touchdown king Montee Ball, two draft-pick O-Linemen, and three starters in the defensive secondary. We also do not have a clear-cut starting quarterback yet

We also will be shifting from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defensively. There will be more blitzing and man coverage than we’re used to, all but one play on the lines and 5 are from Wisconsin.

With a relatively easy schedule... Okay fine, as does happen with new coaches, the amount of wins could be swayed 1-2 in either direction. Without any bias, expect Wisconsin to finish the regular season in 2nd or 3rd place of the Leaders Division with 2 or 3 losses. Best case scenario, Wisconsin, with the help of Gary Andersen’s magic, lose only 1 game in the regular season, and go to the Rose Bowl for a 4th straight year (but this is like... wet-dream level outcomes here.)

With a new coach in Gary Andersen many Badger fans hope he can be the coach to push us to the next level.  While Andersen is keeping Wisconsin’s ground-and-pound, he has also said he wants to add some spread option to Wisconsin’s game, is a much more aggressive recruiter, and has added many [new wrinkles to Wisconsin’s practices](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130419/gary-andersen-wisconsin/).

It’s far too early to tell what Gary can do

Minnesota was my safety school. On Wisconsin.

Since Tech joined the ACC, this game has consistently been very close; Since 1983, the series is at 16-15 with a slight Tech advantage. Tech also leads the overall series 50-25-2.

**Auburn:** A defunct rivalry that had been played more than 80 times. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech's second-most-often played opponent in football. For many years, Georgia, very close to the boundary between the two states. This is a friendly reminder that Auburn lost to Reggie Ball. Twice.

**Alabama:** This is known for the most epic coaching dual in southern football history; Dodd vs. Bryant. This rivalry was so intense that it’s actually the reason Georgia Tech isn’t in the SEC anymore. It began in 1961 when Alabama’s Darwin Holt cold-cocked Georgia Tech’s Chick Granning. The blow actually ended the career of Granning. Yellow Jacket coach Bobby Dodd was understandably peeved and wrote a letter to Alabama coach Bear Bryant

**Honorable mention:** The state of Mississippi: The interesting thing here is that there are no rivalries, we didn’t want to play in the middle of nowhere. And apparently these hicks weren’t going to let us dictate where the games were played, so we didn’t play. Tech leads the overall series with Mississippi St. 4-0 and Ole Miss 2-1.

**2012 Season**

**[Record:](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/59/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets)** 7-7-0 (5-3)

**Coach:** [Paul Johnson](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2496/3895082400_843449cabd.jpg)

**[2012 Roster](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/roster/_/id/59/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets)**

**Key Players:**

**[Tevin Washington](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/tevin_washington_343980.html)** - Almost all of our offense comes from the starting QB spot, or whoever he gives the ball to, and Tevin did well in his role in 2012. He leaves having put his name all over the GT and the ACC record books

**[Orwin Smith](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/orwin_smith_402626.html)** - The playmaker on offense

**[Jeremiah Attaochu](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jeremiah_attaochu_710582.html)** - One of the bright spots on our mediocre defense

**Biggest Plays:**

* [Ray Beno 9 yard reception for a first down.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfxI6I5WxY)

* Vad Lee [25 yard TD run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIe8gJGzR9w). This is exciting because he’s our backup QB and we’ve all got big hopes for him.

* Jamal Golden returns kick [97 yards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nJnO2Xn5po) and [100 yards.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1Fz4_I_DM)

* [4th down conversion followed by TD pass towards end of regulation against VT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBiX6rc0qjQ&amp;t=5m0s).

* [Jemea Thomas interception against Florida State.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBiX6rc0qjQ&amp;t=7m18s)

* [Tevin Washington to Orwin Smith 17 yard TD reception on 3rd and goal against USC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzMl2IZo7mE&amp;t=40m55s)

**2013 Season**

**[2013 Schedule](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/sched/geot-m-footbl-sched.html)**

The schedule makers didn’t do us much of a favor

**[2013 Roster](http://www.ramblinwreck.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/geot-m-footbl-mtt.html)**

**The Greats**

**Greatest Games:** 

* **2008 GT vs uga** - The 08 team was an extremely surprising one, rallying from a 28-12 deficit to win the game 45-42.

* **1976 GT vs ND** - Tech came into the game against #11 Notre Dame with its first 3 QBs injured and was having a poor season overall. But despite their shortcomings

* **1962 GT vs Alabama** - This game is widely considered by older fans as the greatest Tech game ever. Alabama came into the game on a 26 game winning streak and were widely favored. However, future Tech QB and radio announcer, was invited up to Bear Bryant’s hotel room for a recruiting visit. When he and his family walked in, they saw the Bear looking out the window, chain smoking cigarettes. Bryant kept looking out the window saying “This is Dodd’s weather, this is Dodd’s kind of weather.” The he said “Mrs. King, excuse my language ma’am, Tech scored first

* **1990 GT vs UVA** - Tech went into this game ranked 7th in the nation after starting the season unranked. UVA was ranked 1st. Scott Sisson’s kick at the end of regulation turned us into serious title contenders. [Link](http://www.footballstudyhall.com/2011/5/28/2189221/what-i-love-the-1990-virginia-georgia-tech-game)

**Greatest Plays:** 

* **[Wrong Way Riegals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA8ShsySc48)** - Considered to be one of the worst CFB blunders of all time, and ran 65 yards the wrong direction. Tech blocked the ensuing Cal punt for a safety, and won the game 8-7.

* **[2008 Tech forces a fumble on the goalline to put away the victory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyGQ_lyd83E)** - We dominated most of the 2008 game against FSU until starting QB Joshua Nesbitt was hurt. Our offense sputtered and FSU got back into the game. They had the ball, and Cooper Taylor, the freshman safety forced a fumble that Rashaad Reid, another freshman, recovered.

* **[2004 Tech beats Clemson on an extremely late pass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyGQ_lyd83E)** (sorry for the terrible quality, including this one with 11 seconds left to win the game 28-24. Clemson muffed the punt, and Reggie Ball capitalized by throwing a beautiful fade to Calvin Johnson to score the game winner.

**Greatest Players:** 

* **Clint Castleberry** - The only person to have his jersey retired at Tech, and his B-26 bomber was lost over Africa in 1944.

* **Joe Hamilton** - He led one of the more prolific GT offenses in modern history, as well as winning the Davey O’Brien award and being named 1st team AA. He is also fondly remembered for beating Georgia twice.

* **Eddie Lee Ivery** - Held the single game rushing record for a time with 356 yards. He gained all of those yards with the flu and in the snow playing at Air Force.

* **Calvin Johnson** - Can’t forget Calvin. An athletic freak who can get to almost any ball thrown to him

**Greatest Coaches:** 

* **John Heisman** - The namesake for the Heisman Trophy

* **William Alexander** - Coached at Tech from 1920-1944 with a record of 134-95-15. He won Tech’s second national title in 1928. The basketball arena was named after him before a donor gave money to rebuild it.

* **Bobby Dodd** - One of the most interesting coaches ever, a phenomena that routinely saw his teams pull out late game victories. The coach of the year trophy is named after him, as is Bobby Dodd Stadium. He is one of 3 men to be in the college football hall of fame as a player and a coach. I highly recommend his biography, Dodd’s Luck, it’s full of interesting stuff.

**Traditions**

* While we are officially known as the Yellow Jackets, and was the personal car of a student at the time. While it was originally a 1916 Model T Ford, the current Wreck is a 1930 Model A Ford. It led the team out of the tunnel in the 1961 game against Rice University and has continued to lead the team out ever since.

* One of the more popular student traditions is stealing the T from [Tech Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TechTowerSign.jpg). It originated in 1969 and has been done many times since. However

* [George P. Burdell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Burdell). Read the link

* [The Budweiser song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhfd8_e1hec) is always performed in the second half of sporting events

* There are many more great traditions

**Campus and Surrounding Area**

**City Population:** Atlanta proper: 432,213

**City Skyline:** [Downtown](http://www.slrobertson.com/images/usa/georgia/atlanta/downtown/atl-downtown-skyline-pano-2-b.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Building:** [Tech Tower](http://www.gatech.edu/images/splashFactsandFigures.jpg)

**Local Dining:** The Varsity: Everytime you see Tech on ESPN, upgraded version of McDonalds. And definitely don't eat here before a game, as you’ll be needing a toilet shortly afterwards.

**The Vortex:** Regularly featured on the Food Network

**Carver’s country kitchen:** A meat &amp; 2 ran by an elderly couple until recently. (The husband died and the wife considered closing but now will be reopening in a new location just down the street.) It has been located in an old grocery store with community style seating

**Random Trivia**

* The motivation for our “Yellow Jacket” moniker is not an insect. This nickname was developed in an era where people would wear suits for everything; it was odd if a man did not wear a sports jacket. This was also an era before gold pigment. So our fans would wear yellow jackets to the games and opposing journalists would often say that the yellow jackets are coming to town.

* Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field is the oldest Division 1 on campus stadium

* Tech almost always wears its white jerseys

* There are bulldog stickers in many of the on-campus urinals.

* Despite the fact that the namesake for the Heisman Trophy coached at Tech

**What Is and What is to Come**

The 2012 season is somewhat bittersweet. We made it to the ACC Championship game, it can’t qualify as a success either.

Things are looking up for 2013 however. We return 16/22 starters, is the expected QB starter, and if he lives up to his potential our offense will be extremely dangerous. While we lost playmaker Orwin Smith, we run by committee, so there is plenty of experienced depth waiting to step up and fill that void. With a new DC in Ted Roof, our defense will be switching to a base 4-3 from the base 3-4 that was the hallmark of Coach Groh’s tenure. We never really had the DL talent to run the 3-4, and it really showed. If our defense can improve from mediocre to average, if the defense can’t improve

**Overtime**

What’s the Good Word?

My dad has been out of a job for quite some time, since my brother doesn't currently play QB; but aspires to reach his goal to do so like Collin did. My mom's friend has a son who goes to K State who left Collin a message about signing this football. Through the greatness of man, these dudes were able to achieve this. Not only that, but apparently this ball was inside a parked car that was hit by a drunk driver. While the car was totaled, this ball somehow survived. It's an amazing Christmas gift, and my brother broke down into tears after he realized what it really was. He thought it came from a store, and as soon as my mom said no and explained he shed his tears of glory. [Here's a picture of him right before my mom said it's real](http://i.imgur.com/RjFwj.png) . There's no pictures of him after since he was embarrassed and turned his back around to hide his tears

**Marching Band:** 

Founded in 1879, 2011. They are one of the best-traveled bands in college football, as the Huskers have been to all major bowl games, and are regarded as an excellent marching band, winning the John Philip Sousa Foundation’s Sudler Trophy in 1996 (an award voted on by all NCAA marching band directors), and enjoying a performance onstage at the Kennedy Center as part of the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, DC. The best known (and beloved) songs among fans are “Dear Old Nebraska U” and “Hail Varsity

On game days, then meets in Westbrook Music Building in full uniform for instructions and warm-up. The band plays outside Kimball Recital Hall and leads the fans in a traditional march to the stadium, where they perform the “Pregame Spectacular,” including John Philip Sousa’s own University of Nebraska March and the visiting team’s fight song (‘cause Nebraskans are nice like that.) 

[Wiki on Marching Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska_Cornhusker_Marching_Band)

[Hail Varsity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8aVN9wSyBk)

[Clearer sound version of Hail Varsity with the lyrics that almost no one knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiLOA5aRtfE)

**Stadium:** [1](http://www.huskers.com/pics10/800/EB/EBRZMZXRZQUKSWZ.20090928151816.jpg) [2](http://www.laketheposts.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nebraska-memorial-stadium_.jpg) 

Located at 600 Stadium Drive in Lincoln,067, but packed in 86,304 fans for the team’s 300th consecutive sellout, September 26, 2009, against Louisiana-Lafayette’s Ragin’ Cajuns. You can’t walk two blocks in Lincoln without hearing about the sellout streak, I believe

Modeled after new conference rival Ohio State’s stadium,000 seats initially. Expansions from 1964-1972 added north and south end zone seats, boosting its capacity to almost 74,000, and in 1999, 42 luxury boxes were added to the stadium. 13 more were added in 2004 as part of a north end zone stands renovation, as well as the 7, 1986. 

Two legends from Nebraska’s “golden era” are honored by statues on the north side of the stadium: coach for 25 years, and QB Brook Berringer, who died in a plane crash in 1996. 

[**Other cool stuff in Lincoln

**All-time record:** 856-353-40

**Division championships (Big 12 and B1G):** 6 and 1

**Conference titles:** 43

**National titles:** 5 (1970, 1995, 1997)

**Postseason bowls**: 24-25

**Consensus All-Americans:** 53

**Rivals:** 

We’re still trying to figure this out in the context of the B1G. Wikipedia will tell you that our new conference rivals are Iowa; most Nebraska fans would probably not agree with this. For decades, Nebraska’s enemy number one were still the Sooners, but the team also had a short-lived North Division rivalry with Colorado, and tangled several times with Texas, who certainly had the Huskers’ number in the years that they contested conference title games and regular season clashes. 

Oklahoma leads the rivalry series 45-38-3

The Colorado rivalry was a bit less clear-cut (and intense), and 1990, all against Nebraska teams ranked third in the nation) marked the Buffaloes’ rise to national prominence (and a title) in 1990. Nebraska would essentially own the series through the “golden decade” of the 1990s, then catastrophically let Colorado run all over them in 2001 and again dropped the rivalry game in 2002.

The mirror opposite of the Colorado rivalry for the late 1990s and 2000s was the Texas rivalry – Texas did not consider us a major rival

[2012 Roster](http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=4&amp;SPID=22&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;Q_SEASON=2012)

**Key Players 2012:** 

Rex Burkhead, and 6th round draft pick by the Cincinnati Bengals. Taylor Martinez, the often-brilliant yet mistake-prone quarterback whose mobility in an otherwise disastrous B1G title game against Wisconsin earned him ESPN’s #1 Play of the Day. (See below, Season Highlights)

Ameer Abdullah was the Huskers’ top rusher in 2012, Quincy Enunwa. 

On the defensive side of the ball, and Cameron Meredith anchored a Jekyll and Hyde defense seemingly capable of clamping down talented offensive teams one week then giving up buckets of yards and points to a mediocre team the next.

**Season Highlights:** 

[Taylor Martinez's athleticism vs. Wisconsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Bg4fz99AY) is probably the signature highlight play of last season.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8F8sJsAjnU) seems a well-curated collection for a 10-4 season, an even worse debacle against Wisconsin (“The Massacre at Lucas Oil Stadium) in the B1G title game, and a rather heartbreaking loss to SEC runner-ups Georgia in the Citrus Bowl after keeping up with their dynamic offense for three quarters. Aaron Murray’s accuracy devastated the Husker secondary in the fourth quarter as the tired Huskers gave up huge pass plays and failed to stay in the game. 

**Great Games:** 

If I had to pick only two, linked above and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Yh867H4Sg)

…and the [1996 Fiesta Bowl]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfusYeGyKok) perhaps the apex of Nebraska’s entire storied history of college football. 

Note especially the “almost safety

Osborne was so classy as a coach that he had third (or fourth?) string QB Matt Turman take victory formation on Florida’s one-yard line rather than go up 69-24. Florida Coach Steve Spurrier was in tears by that point – he had run up the score on so many teams that he probably didn’t even realize the Huskers were not, and had pulled the vast majority of the first (and second) string from the field by the fourth quarter anyway. 

**The Golden Era (mid-1990s)** was Nebraska’s second such era

In the seasons between 1993-1997

You can pick your measure of excellence for the [1995 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football_team), a humiliation and shutout of hated rival Oklahoma in the traditional Thanksgiving game, or a 62-24 victory over highly-regarded #2 Florida in a game that many experts said would be too close to call. College football fans were used to Nebraska getting to the big stage and choking. But after tasting narrow defeat on a wayward FG attempt in 1993 against Florida State, and the elation of victory the year before against Miami, Nebraska completed the trifecta of Florida powerhouse teams in style. 

Two years deserve special mention here: 1984, when he had no such choice because Michigan and Nebraska could not play. (In spite of the volumes of invective leveled at the BCS, that system would have at least insured that those teams would play for a winner-takes-all title, not the title that the Huskers and Wolverines split.) 

The [final play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoNs0mdKAO8) of the 1984 Orange Bowl is still pretty hard to watch for Husker fans

*Pacific-12 Conference*

***

**Year Founded:** 1880

**Location:** Los Angeles

**Total Attendance:** 38,000 grad)

**Nickname:** Trojans

So why name your team after glorious warriors who were *defeated* in battle? It makes sense if you put USC into the historical context of the region: modern California first developed around the Bay Area. When USC was founded in 1880, here's a rare [aerial balloon photo of LA from 1887](http://i.imgur.com/aS2IRc7.jpg) (north is roughly to the left); USC was founded on the southern edge of (town off the photo to the right) next to a fair ground called “Agricultural Park” (now Exposition Park). Meanwhile, despite being founded 8 years after USC, Stanford jumped ahead in every category because it was closer to the wealth and population. This gap translated into sports: although USC established itself as the most respectable regional program in contests between Oxy, Pomona, Whittier, Caltech and Loyola

During those early years the school had unofficial names like the Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans (which is odd because the school was never particularly religious and dropped it altogether not long into its history, a reporter assigned to cover an intercollegiate track meet noted that the USC players were competing hard despite an obvious lack of financial resources in a noble battle for the sake of sport. He said they “fought like Trojans.” The name quickly stuck. Soon afterward, Los Angeles and USC quickly grew up in size and relative power, and the Bay Area and their schools continue to hate both to this day. [As Beano Cook once put it](http://espn.go.com/classic/s/beano_stanusc.html): Stanford and Cal want to beat each other, but they *hate* USC. Interestingly, the feeling isn't mutual. If you want to understand LA, the Big Lebowski and LA Story captured the blase feeling about anything... Dude

**Mascot:**

Official: **[Traveler](http://i.imgur.com/93mmUSs.jpg)** – USC's mascot is actually [the white horse](http://sait.usc.edu/recsports/spirit/traveler/home.html)... a *Trojan horse*, Traveler would gallop around the track. When Al Davis had the stadium renovated into something more NFL-friendly, they removed the track causing Traveler to run along a much more crowded sideline. Honestly_ was at the 2000 game where that galloping tradition ended as Traveler knocked down a totally unwitting guy on the sideline (the guy was okay). Now the horse has spotters who run ahead of him and clear a path, but it's still not quite as majestic as it used to be.

But Traveler was only the mascot since 1961... what was the USC mascot before that? A dog. But not just any dog: **[George Tirebiter](http://i.imgur.com/I2MDcRw.jpg)**. In the 1940s, folks were willing to look past his faults. He was even dognapped and drugged a few times by UCLA students. Alas, Tirebiter I got even more ferocious over time so he was forcibly retired, only to die a year later doing what he loved the most—chasing cars (such is the life of a true hunter).

[](/kiffin) **""QamvIS Hegh qaq law' torvIS yIn qaq puS!""**

He was followed by several other Tirebiters until the school went with the horse. Still, and his cool [statue, complete with a stack of tires, has a prominent spot on campus](http://i.imgur.com/l7XjrEo.jpg), on the same street he used to chase
cars (which is now pedestrian-only).

Unofficial: **Tommy Trojan**, but occasionally [they strike during off weeks](http://i.imgur.com/L5u6QvZ.jpg). Meanwhile, [the band's drum major is also decked out in an elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword](http://i.imgur.com/SiapBNx.jpg). He plants his sword at the center of the field before every game, to the roar of the crowd.

**~~Cheerleaders~~ [USC Song Girls](http://i.imgur.com/68Hg7.jpg)!!!** USC doesn't have cheerleaders, but they were phased out for a generic co-ed “Spirit Leaders” that deserve no further mention.

**Band:** [The Spirit Of Troy](http://i.imgur.com/pFeMea5.jpg), home *and away*, since 1987, and the entire band always travels to South Bend for Notre Dame. This is Hollywood's college band, having appeared in a variety of shows and movies, ranging from the Naked Gun, to playing Alabama's band in Forrest Gump, multiple Grammys (with Outkast and Radiohead)
They also make up the house band for the Lakers thanks to late-alum/owner Jerry Buss.

**Fight Song:** Fight On. If you play us

We're also known by our opponents for Tribute to Troy, and Fight On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ7oArZrQ1s). Fanfare makes you want to grab a sword and charge.

We have two other signature songs that deserve mention: [Conquest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8AC-qRzYh4) was actually written as the main theme of the 1947 epic film the Captain from Castile, our fight song was written before they were relevant at sports so Tusk filled the gap.

**First Season:** 1888

**Stadium:** [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum](http://i.imgur.com/aK6xgdH.jpg) (93, [World Series](http://i.imgur.com/4yH435c.jpg), Democratic Convention ([Kennedy accepted the nomination here](http://i.imgur.com/qIzCYeL.jpg)), [Papal Visit](http://i.imgur.com/8yiM7T4.jpg), [porn movie(s?)](http://i.imgur.com/Gkc50V1.gif), Hollywood movies, numerous GameDay and All State commercials, X-Games, much more. The Olympic cauldron/torch is [lit at the beginning of the fourth quarter at all USC games.](http://i.imgur.com/4rkeOL7.jpg)

**Stadium Location:** Los Angeles, and until very recently was directly managed by the Coliseum Commission, made up of an even split of City/County/State appointees. After years of bungling, corruption (cough-cough, Bernard Parks), and delayed renovation in hopes of luring a new NFL team to do it all for them, USC lawyers skillfully wrested the Master Lease away from the Commission and into the hands of the university. Improvements are coming. Exposition Park also has a lot of cool museums and the popular rose garden. The neighboring Sports Arena used to be the home of the Lakers, Kings

**All-time Record:** 779-313-54 (.703)

**Conference Championships:** 38

**Bowl Games:** 31-16 (24-9 Rose Bowl record)

**National Titles (11 claimed):** 1928, 1939, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978, 2004*

*BCS and FWAA titles vacated; sorry Auburn

* For a long time an entire generation of Trojans grew up knowing USC had eight national championships: 1928, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974 and 1978. After USC won its first title in 25 years in 2003, the Athletic Department claimed 1939's 8-0-2 season using something called the Dickinson System. It's dubiously legit, or legitimately dubious. Here's what happened: [Texas A&amp;M won the AP Poll, 14-13.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_college_football_season#Bowl_Games) (this is why we needed a playoff). So basically we got two titles in one season (one if you ask LSU fans.) With the 2004 title being vacated by everyone except the AP and USC some would say that the Trojans earned three titles nobody
 recognizes
in the span of *two* calendar years

***
*Rivals:*
***

**Notre Dame** – USC's greatest rival, yada yada yada. The entire nation gets shovelfuls of this stuff every odd October and even November... and USC fans love it. This really is [an amazing rivalry](http://i.imgur.com/c1plVdN.jpg), one that makes little geographic sense but has produced more national titles, Heisman winners and illegal forward motion assists than any other. Notre Dame leads the series 44-34, with the longest non-losing streak in the rivalry (13-0-1 between 1983-96). The Trojans are currently on a one game losing streak to the Irish. The winner of this game gets the [Jeweled Shillelagh](http://i.imgur.com/bNfK7CJ.jpg), which kind of looks like a knotted emerald and ruby penis (they're actually on the second trophy after the first filled). Little known fact: Brent Musburger has twice collapsed from a priapism (1999, 2005) while calling this game
 has since
been retrofitted with blood pumps to make sure the flow from the venerated announcer's brain to his nethers is even and uninterrupted.

**UCLA** – The largest intra-city FBS rivalry, rich vs. slightly less rich (you may be surprised which is which), red vs. blue, one is good at football and one is UCLA, etc. The Bruins enjoyed national and local relevance under Terry Donahue (1975-96) and Bob Toledo (1996-2002) as well as an eight game winning streak vs. the Trojans during the nineties, but USC leads the series 46-29-7. After two tumultuous coaching changes UCLA is currently enjoying a one game winning streak over USC under new coach Jim Mora. The two school shared the same home stadium until 1983, when UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl which is even *farther* away from its campus (USC remains closer to
both stadiums). The winner of this match up gets the Victory Bell, and [even non-sports.](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/10/local/la-me-0510-usc-ucla-brain-research-20130510)

**Stanford** – Unbeknownst to the rest of the nation but knownst to both the current generation of Trojans and anyone who lived prior to 2002, during the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, enjoyed regional and national success that pitted it against the West Coast's premier power in USC. That rivalry was renewed with 2007's epic upset at the hands of Jim Harbaugh's Cardinal, somehow using a quarterback named Tavita Pritchard – who is not a lesbian ceramics professor – to defeat a Trojans squad that was favored by 837 points. Harbaugh would go on to hand USC it's worse loss in 43 years by [going for two in a 55-21 beatdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS3VeluAmg). Stanford has won the last five of six against USC, two of them in memorably late fashion. The two bands genuinely hate each other. The victor of this rivalry receives Smugness +1.

[“[The Weekender](http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2012/09/weekender-rally-in-union-square.html)”, where there's a will, there's a way when it comes to scheduling your rivals]

**Cal** – The Bears enjoyed a mid-2000s renaissance, 17 times, but stupid Texas something something. No, seriously, there was a rivalry here under since departed Jeff Tedford, with Cal playing USC nail bitingly close in a four year span with national implications in each game, the highlight of which was the 23-19 USC win on their way to the 2004 national title. The intensity of this rivalry was rekindled after the Trojans' 2003 triple overtime loss in Strawberry Canyon, but it is thoroughly lopsided with USC leading the series 64-29-5. Although it's not really relevant here's [Marshawn Lynch riding a cart.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqMsT_2teus)

[](/kiffin) **“Look, m'kay?”**

[**2012 Roster**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_USC_Trojans_football_team#Roster)  

**Key Players:**

* Matt Barkley (Sr. QB) - In many ways, passing yards (12,237), completions (1,001), attempts (1,562) and total offense (12, and also his [AMAs are pretty good](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/x5lrk/iam_matt_barkley_quarterback_of_the_usc_trojans/). And although he never won a Heisman or a national championship you'd be hard pressed to find a USC fan who didn't hold Barkley in the highest regard. As a true freshman starter he helmed the Trojans through a shocking change from Pete Carroll to Kiffin
then terrible, Barkley is probably too busy smiling at a sunflower to care.

* Matt Barkley's Shoulder (RS Sr.) - Though the season didn't rest entirely on MB7's Shoulder, respectively. Instead we got an unceremonious and frankly horrifying look at the future as RS Fr. QB Max Wittek took the stage and quickly took a big fat dump, followed by an even bigger, fatter dump. Little did we know that it was The Shoulder that wielded the Toilet Paper, and for four wonderful years we were protected by His Throwing Arm Mandate. But now The Shoulder is gone, and with it the Bum Wad. Please ignore any confusing metaphors.

* Marqise Lee (So. WR) - He was not the most heralded. He was,721 yards in 2012 winning him the Belitnikoff Award. Lane Kiffin designed every manner of screen imaginable to get his star receiver the ball and probably would have had Lee hike the ball to himself if it were legal. Lee will enter the 2013 season as the face of the team and on a short list of ""most dynamic"" players in the nation, which is to say he'll be a Heisman hopeful until they give it to a QB or RB. But that new award for Most Similar To A Cyborg Gazelle? Lee's going to win that.

* Robert Woods (Jr. WR) - In many way Woods is the perfect symbol of the 2012 season. A consensus All-American in 2011 with a conference record 111 receptions for 15 touchdowns and 1, good for second team Pac-12. It was an otherwise good year but fell far short of expectations, prompting Woods to declare early for the NFL draft. When asked how much Lee's ascent factored into his decision, [Woods said](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/31/sports/la-sp-usc-football-notes-20130101) ""Not much. I mean if the coaches wanted to keep me another year they would have probably got me the ball..."" His comments echoed fans' misgivings over Kiffin's play calling and proved to be a fitting and sad coda for what was widely believed to be the start of one of the greatest offensive
careers in USC history.

*The Greats*
***

**Greatest Games:**

* 1967 vs. #1 UCLA

* 1970 vs. #16 Alabama - Trojan FB Sam ""Bam"" Cunningham ran for 135 yards and two touchdowns to lead USC past an all-white Alabama team in Birmingham. All six USC touchdowns were scored by African-American players. Bear Bryant had previously flown to LAX to briefly meet with John McKay and secure the game. The Bear knew what he wanted and the loss reportedly gave him the ammunition to speed up the full integration of his team

* 1974 vs. #5 Notre Dame, setting off a barrage of 55 unanswered points as USC defeated Notre Dame 55-24 in one of the wildest games in the history of the Coliseum. Bring up this game if you know an Irish fan older than fifty. With Traveler galloping around the track for seemingly the entire second half, [Keith Jackson commented](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/afterword/2010/02/mosi-tatupus-role-in-uscs-victory-over-notre-dame-in-1974.html): ""I'll tell you one thing that game did: It made Ara Parseghian hate all white horses.""

* 2005 vs. #9 Notre Dame, USC was faced with a 4th-and-9 from its own 26 with 1:32 remaining. USC QB Matt Leinart audibled to WR Dwayne Jarrett for a 61-yard fade. A few plays later Leinart ran out of bounds as the time ticked off to zero and the fans stormed the field, only to be brought back as officials put seven seconds back on the clock. Carroll was shown on national television signalling for the spike as Leinart snapped the ball on a QB sneak. Made entirely of elbows and well sculpted hair, he was stopped short by the Irish defensive front only to be pushed into the endzone by Reggie Bush in what was later declared an illegal maneuver. An entire nation laughed, threw up in
their mouths a little and prepared for another week of ESPN fawning.

* 2006 Rose Bowl vs. #2 Texas - In perhaps the greatest game ever played and certainly one of the most memorable national championships, allowing Vince Young to lope past USC's secondary with 17 seconds left. The teams entered the game as season long #1 and #2, and Young's performance is the greatest bowl game effort in the history of history. Joke's on Texas though because that game doesn't count.

**Greatest Plays**:

* OJ's 64-yard run
* [Haden-to-Diggs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i99nER5cexI) - QB Pat Haden completes a two point conversion to WR Shelton Diggs to beat Ohio State 18-17 in the 1975 Rose Bowl to win a share of the national championship.
* [Antuan Simmons' between the legs interception return](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVNrgD2F3Bo) - This high steppin' SOB somehow managed to pick off UCLA's Cory Paus in the first quarter of a game USC needed to win to qualify for a bowl game in Carroll's first year. The return of the Trojans' swagger after a long and depressing absence.
* Leinart's reverse TD seals USC's first title in a quarter of a century:
* [USC scores 28 points on 8 plays for 246 yards in 1:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fWz8QAYfTw) - The epitome of the best offense in USC history
Arkansas in the first quarter.

* OL Bruce Matthews (you might have heard of his nephew
* DB Troy Polamalu  
* LB [Junior Seau](http://i.imgur.com/POvq4J2.jpg)  

**Greatest Coaches:**

* Howard Jones (1925–1940) – 1928, 121–36–13 overall. Jones put USC football on the national map. The Notre Dame rivalry started under his watch as his “Thundering Herd” squads smashed through schedules. He was known for being non-nonsense, and even bland, as he lived and breathed football. He died suddenly of a heart attack at age 55—who knows what he could've accomplished had that not happened.

* John McKay (1960-1975) - 1962, 127-40-8 overall record. Unlike Jones, McKay was witty off the field and known for his quotes. Following the 51–0 loss to Notre Dame in 1966, ""I told my team it doesn't matter. There are 750 million people in China who don't even know this game was played. The next day, a guy called me from China and asked, 'What happened, Coach?'"" Following a game in 1967 in which OJ Simpson carried 30 times, ""Why not? It's not heavy

* Pete Carroll (2000-09) - 2003 and 2004 national titles, and Mike Riley all turned it down. Why? Because the pressure to succeed at moribund USC was so intense that it seemed like a no-win situation. Yet Carroll proved it could be done. His run at USC was nothing short of tremendous: the energy, passion, humor, etc. [Here is the best article ever written about his tenure.](http://www.lamag.com/features/2007/12/01/23-reasons-why-a-profile-of-pete-carroll-does) It's hard to believe Carroll or anyone thought USC was going to get hit with the sheer force the NCAA opted to use. He always had an eye on the NFL, because his life was about “win forever” and after failing twice there was no way he wasn't going to take another swipe at the The League, but more on his own terms. He has seriously beautiful hair.

****
*Traditions*
****

* [The Victory Sign.](http://i.imgur.com/VhTUjnc.jpg) USC fans love to give the V-symbol and pump their arms from the elbow.

* ""Fight On!"" is a battle cry among Trojans

* No Names: USC players have never worn names on their jerseys. Those non alum a-holes wearing the fake #32 jerseys with ""Simpson"" on the back? We hate them too.

* Band concerts: The band plays a free concert before the game (at away games it's sometimes only allowed at the private alumni gathering). On campus it's done in front of our main auditorium and the band then leads the march to the Coliseum. After the game the band plays a post-game concert in the stadium

* Kicking the flagpoles: At the edge of campus

* #55: Traditionally given to only the most deserving linebacker

* [SoCal Spellout] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDKuZocShg): A raucous chant that is getting harder and harder to understand because everyone gets so excited yelling it. S-O-U-T-H-E-R-N... C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A... SouTHERN... Califoooooooornia!

* [4th quarter lighting of the torch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM--HisVw08): Before the start of the 4th quarter of every USC home game

* Tailback U: The Trojans have been known as Tailback U after featuring five Heisman Trophy winners at the position in addition to numerous All-Americans.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

**City Population:** 3, but they're weird and relatively small borders, the metro is 12,828,837.

[**City Skyline**](http://i.imgur.com/EeTAEqE.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Building:**

* **Bovard Auditorium** ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/CwIODDx.jpg), but probably the one that sticks out most is Legally Blonde: normally [no one would sit like these extras were sitting in those windows (I think it was supposed to be a Harvard dorm](http://i.imgur.com/7GyHF5u.jpg)

* [**Doheny Memorial Library**](http://i.imgur.com/PLhzgS1.jpg), my favorite is The Graduate, as Doheny and several other buildings were used as UC Berkeley ([here's a YouTube video of those scenes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh7H6XC11P8&amp;t=4m27s))

* [**Widney Alumni House**](http://i.imgur.com/xO3dUVf.jpg): This is the original 1880 building that started USC. [Here it is in 1903.](http://i.imgur.com/Cbson1J.jpg) It's been moved twice to different parts of campus

* **[Mudd Hall of Philosophy](http://i.imgur.com/x1R1jf2.jpg)** -- modeled after a medieval Tuscan monastery

* The **Galen Center** is USC's basketball arena that replaced the aging Sports Arena (which was city-owned). The coolest thing about the modern facility is the [window on one end that has a view of the downtown LA skyline.](http://i.imgur.com/jknbdce.jpg)

**Local Dining:**

Where to begin

* **Tommy's** ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Tommy's)): The original location of local chain Original Tommy's isn't near campus but is a classic among Trojans. Chili Burgers and Chili Fries. There are no seats, order a Chili Cheese Fries, it's heaven.

* **901 Bar &amp; Grill** ([website](http://www.901bar.com/index.php)): The “Nine-O” is *the* USC neighborhood bar. Why go to th...[wha...what were we talking about?](http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/901-bar-and-grill-los-angeles?select=aBrxXlgpptyAVhvVlfL3Ow#aBrxXlgpptyAVhvVlfL3Ow)

* **Chano's** ([website](http://theoriginalchanos.com/history.html)): Right by campus

* **Philippe's** ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe%27s)): Inventor of the French Dip sandwich. Popular with USC fans and Dodger fans. Again, with their home made coleslaw (request it wet). The apple pie is solid. The mustard is kick-ass strong, but good on the sandwich.

* **El Cholo** ([website](http://www.elcholo.com/asp/site/losAngeles/index.asp?Location=1)): This authentic Mexican restaurant opened in 1923 next to the Coliseum

* **La Barca**: Another popular Mexican restaurant not too far from campus. Has a very popular happy hour.

* **Bacon-wrapped hot dog carts**: While Roy Choi's Kogi trucks are widely regarded as the grandfathers of the food truck revolution that has taken the falafel you never ate and turned it into the organic kimchee falafel with avocado crema you are definitely now not eating, mayo and, if you're lucky, some kind of spice out of a nondescript can. The police shut down as many as they can but, like the American spirit glorious and free, the bacon dog cart will never die. Unless somebody gets botulism or salmonella, in which case we'll die. But not the carts.

*Random Trivia*
***

* Trojan athletes have won 287 medals at the Olympic games (135 golds, it would rank 12th in most Olympic gold medals (and that includes the Winter Games, which we barely participate in). USC led the number of medals and golds in the 2012 Olympics among schools as well.

* USC leads the total number of NFL Draft picks with 479; rival Notre Dame is a very close second

* USC has a winning record against all other members of the Pac-12.

* Female USC teams are called the Women of Troy. The two most famous are basketball greats Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie.

* USC has won 120 team national championships, 19 in tennis, 12 in baseball, 9 in swimming and diving, 7 in water polo.

* USC's first All-American (1925), and was instrumental in starting would become the Bayou Classic against rival Grambling.

* **[The Super Fan](http://i.imgur.com/o8ZROkV.jpg):** Although every school has their fan who has a streak of games, He saw the Trojans go 532-225-40, win nine national championships, and play under ten different head coaches. He died in the same place he watched his first game: the Rose Bowl.

* USC has [the world's best film school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_School_of_Cinematic_Arts), totaling 256 nominations and 78 wins. Also since 1973, at least one alum has been nominated for the Emmy Award annually, totalling 473 nominations and 119 wins. The top 17 grossing films of all time have had an SCA graduate in a key creative position. Steven Spielberg has donated a ton of money and he was denied admission twice. George Lucas donated $175m to the school in 2006, leading to a new complex that replaced the old one which was anchored by... the Lucas Building. USC student films have won the Palme d’Or and Academy Awards. The faculty is similarly well regarded.

* USC has the most International Students of any American university. USC maintains offices in Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan.

**Key Players:** 

* [Michael Mauti (LB)](http://imgur.com/MsoH3TO) - Perhaps not the hero Penn State deserved

* [Matt McGloin (QB)](http://imgur.com/SvPm5pp) - Moxie McGloin was a walk-on who sat behind Daryll Clark, in 2012, he surpassed Clark’s record for single-season yards and completions, as well as career TD passes. His progression was a testament to O’Brien’s offense and the mark of a bold new era in Penn State Football.
* [Allen Robinson (WR)](http://imgur.com/eSQ8TQ2) - Robinson was a huge surprise to many who followed the Nittany Lions in 2012. As a member of the [“Supa Six”](http://imgur.com/4Kh3gcW)

* [Sam Ficken (K)](http://imgur.com/zrfOALl) - Regardless of what Penn State fans choose to remember from last year, let it be known, Ficken scored the game-winning field goal in OT on Senior Day against Wisconsin- ending the year on a solid note and capping off an emotional season for the Nittany Lions.

**Biggest Plays:** 

* [**Penn State - Northwestern**: *The Entire 4th Quarter*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=U88jYnbTdRw#t=39s) Down 28-17, the ball and the game came into Penn State’s possession. Moxie McGloin’s showcase dive into the endzone with just over 2 minutes left in the game put the game in the hands of their very capable defense and Penn State’s homefield advantage. Another touchdown by Zordich put the game on ice and brought the team back to .500 on the season, allowing for a pendulum of momentum to carry them through the remaining six games.

**Greatest Games:**

* [1959: Liberty bowl: Penn State 7 - Alabama 0](http://imgur.com/fh0tfa3)

In a defensive struggle Penn State prevailed with a fake field goal thrown by Galen Hall late in the second quarter. The game is notable because it was Bear Bryant’s first bowl game as head coach of Alabama and Joe Paterno was an assistant on the sidelines.

* [1981 #1 Pitt 14 - #10 Penn State 48](http://imgur.com/CiH7iAI)

It was the last game of the regular season and the #1 ranked Dan Marino led Pittsburgh Panthers were looking forward to going to the national championship game. The Panthers pounced to an early 14 point lead before the Nittany Lions came roaring back and thumped the Panthers. Penn State would go on to win the national championship the next season.

* [1983 Sugar Bowl: #2 Penn state 27 - #1 Georgia 23.](http://imgur.com/5JBSeOO)

Curt Warner outran Herschel Walker and Penn State won its first national championship.

* [1995 Rose Bowl: #2 Penn State 38 - #9 Oregon 20](http://imgur.com/qZ4zOuK) 

Penn State went undefeated and did not win or play for the national championship. Many fans consider the 1994 team the best ever Penn State team.

**Greatest Players:**

* **[Jack Ham](http://imgur.com/rEAaVBv)** - Possibly the greatest Penn State linebacker in our history. [An All-American in 1970](http://imgur.com/KSwrjlF), Ham had 91 tackles and intercepted four passes. He still shares a pair of defensive records for blocked punts: four in his career, three in his final season. He had 251 career tackles (143 solo). A second-round draft choice of the Steelers in 1971, Ham developed into one of the NFL's most outstanding linebackers. He starred on all four of the Steelers' Super Bowl championship teams and was the Defensive Player-of-the-Year in 1975.

* **[John Cappelletti](http://imgur.com/vk069u8)** - Our only [Heisman winner](http://imgur.com/ZuPcLML) amazingly. As a senior tailback at Penn State, Maxwell Award, the UPI College Football Player of the Year, the Walter Camp Award, the Chic Harley Award, as well as receiving All-America honors. In his two-year running-back career, he gained over 100 yards in thirteen games and had a career total of 2, where he dedicated his award to his dying brother, Cappelletti asked Joey what he wanted for his upcoming 11th birthday. Joey replied ""I want you to score three touchdowns for me. No, so when the game resumed after halftime

* **[Paul Posluszny](http://imgur.com/UovRCho)** - Outside linebacker, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and Walter Camp Football Foundation in 2005 and the AP and Walter Camp Football Foundation in 2006. Posluszny became just the second two-time winner of the Chuck Bednarik Award, presented to the nation's top defensive player, in 2006. In 2005, he also won the Butkus Award, presented to the nation's top linebacker and was a finalist for the `06 honor. The 13th Nittany Lion to be named a two-time first-team All-American, he became Penn State's career tackle leader with 372. A starter in the last 37 games of his career

**Greatest Coaches:**

 **[Joe Paterno.](http://imgur.com/bFGqCAp)** Joseph Vincent Paterno was born December 21, New York. He played [quarterback](http://imgur.com/qKP1rWG) and cornerback for the Brown Bears, and shares the career record for interceptions with Greg Parker at 14. Paterno graduated in 1950. Although his father asked, ""For God's sake, what did you go to college for?"" after hearing of his career choice, Paterno joined Rip Engle as an assistant coach at Penn State in 1950; Engle had coached five seasons, 1944–1949, and Paterno was named his successor.

Paterno has an official career record of 298 wins, Paterno had accumulated 409 total collegiate wins, but on July 23, 2012, NCAA rulings officially vacated 111 of Paterno's wins based on the findings of the Freeh report regarding his involvement in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. All wins dating back to 1998 were vacated, the year Paterno was first informed of Sandusky's suspected child abuse. Based on the criteria used by the NCAA, Paterno no longer holds the record for most victories by an NCAA Division I football coach. Former Florida State coach Bobby Bowden now holds the NCAA major college record for wins at 377, Grambling coach Eddie Robinson's 408 victories stands as the official record. In his 46 seasons as a head coach, and Sugar—as well as the Cotton Bowl Classic, 1969

Paterno was a long-time advocate for some type of college football playoff system. The question was posed to him frequently over the years

After the announcement of his hiring in 1966, Penn State's players have consistently demonstrated above-average academic success compared to Division 1-A schools nationwide. According to the NCAA's 2008 Graduation Rates Report, Penn State's four-year Graduation Success Rate of 78% easily exceeds the 67% Division 1 average, second to only Northwestern among Big Ten institutions. In 2011, Penn State football players had an 80% graduation rate and showed no achievement gap between its black and white players, which is extremely rare for Division I football teams. The New American Foundation ranked Penn State No. 1 in its 2011 Academic Bowl Championship Series. Paterno was also renowned for his charitable contributions to academics at Penn State. He and his wife Sue have contributed over $4 million towards various departments and colleges, including support for the Penn State All-Sports Museum, and the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center

* **Those Bastards at [](/pittsburgh) Pitt:** We lead 50*-42-4 (48-42-4). Most people don’t feel too strongly either way about playing Pittsburgh but I hate them. I just want to go into Pittsburgh (which is otherwise a lovely city where all the other sports teams I root for) and whoop Pitt. Sadly, either.](http://imgur.com/HssnsHm)

* **[](/ohiostate) Ohio State:** We’re ‘tied’ 14*-14 (8-14). This is pretty much the biggest game of the year for us since we stopped playing most of our older rivals and Michigan State/Minnesota both rarely/never play us anymore. Winning this game almost always means that a good season lies ahead. This is also one of the few games that seems to almost always also be a night game so we’re usually pretty pumped when the game rolls around.

* **[](/syracuse)Syracuse:** We lead this one 42*-23-5 (40-23-5). Originally they were our biggest rival. This was the game in the Upper New York/Central Pennsylvania area. Both teams enjoyed success in the 1950’s and 1960’s which led to it starting to grow and blossom. But eventually it succumbed to a greater hatred. Which would be the hatred of Pitt.

* **Other notable rivalries:** Michigan State(14*-13-1, 3-4), West Virginia(48-9-2), Alabama(5-10), Maryland(35-1-1), and Notre Dame(9*-9-1, 8-9-1)

*Traditions:*

* **[Nittanyville (Formerly known as Paternoville)](http://imgur.com/BiJYgkw):** ""Nittanyville"" is the name attributed to the student tradition of camping out in front of Beaver Stadium prior to a home football game. The tradition was established during the 2005 football season, the Blue Band, and Joe Paterno himself frequented Paternoville, pepping up the students as game day drew near. Nittanyville is governed by the student-run Nittanyville Coordination Committee. On July 16, 2012, Penn State student organizers announced that they will be renaming the ""tent city"" Nittanyville, opting to drop the reference to Joe Paterno.

* **[Linebacker U](http://imgur.com/trYK3hB):** Penn State is known for producing All-American, Jack Ham, Ed O’Neil, Greg Buttle, Shane Conlan, Lavar Arrington, Cameron Wake, Paul Posluszny, Michael Mauti and Gerald Hodges.

*Campus and Surrounding Area:*

**City Population:** University Park,764

*Iconic Campus Buildings:*

**[Old Main](http://imgur.com/TLO1Bkd):** Our administrative building

**[Paterno-Pattee Library](http://imgur.com/XunFnXh):** the Paterno wing of the library was funded via donations from Joe and Sue Paterno. Rumor has it there is a ghost of a murdered student that haunts the “stacks” of Pattee library.

**[The HUB/Robeson Center](http://imgur.com/CRLjJ04):** The student union building has a Chick-fil-a and houses the offices for student activities and student government.

*Local food:*

* **[The Berkey Creamery](http://imgur.com/7wSZisY)** features ice cream made by [Penn State's food science department](http://imgur.com/VmYAJ1M). It was ranked by Forbes as the best ice cream in America. Ben and Jerry learned how to make ice cream via a course offered by Penn state.

* Walk down **College ave** and its side streets and you will find lots of places to eat

* **[Ye Olde College Diner](http://sites.psu.edu/goodeating/files/2012/09/The-Diner-2.jpg)** is a restaurant of dubious quality but is relatively famous for their [grilled stickies](http://cookingwiththepros.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dsc_0358.jpg). Go in and get one if you want


* State Colleges local Brewpub is **[Otto’s](http://imgur.com/gulUGSh)**


* For Breakfast go to the **[Waffleshop](http://imgur.com/eEMpiSm)**. It has good portions and prices. There are three locations in town.


* If you are planning on going to the bars: **[This website](http://www.statecollege.com/bartour/)** has all the drink deals. Go nuts.

*Random Trivia*

* Penn State’s original colors were Black and Pink.

* [The Legend of Mount Nittany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Nittany#Legend_of_Mount_Nittany)

* During the 1994 undefeated football season Penn State only allowed 4 sacks on Kerry Collins.

* From 2006-2009 Penn State had the second highest total attendance of any team behind only Michigan.

* On gamedays State College is the third largest city in population in the state of Pennsylvania.

***

*What Is and What is to Come*

Without a doubt, by the wolves that were opposing coaches. With a 4 year bowl ban and sanctions on the horizon, there wasn’t much happiness in Happy Valley, last Summer. 


Then Fall came. And the chills soon followed.
 
Penn State football was back and that’s what mattered-- not the media circus, running backs or wide receivers-- football. [Nittany Nation was ready to rally the troops](http://imgur.com/XyG1wE6) and [support their team.](http://imgur.com/DyFY29a)


8-4 is considered by most around State College as a successful season. It was a renewal of spirit for many and the laying of solid groundwork for Bill O’Brien’s stay and that is where hope is found for the future. O’Brien’s mentality keeps Penn State solidly in every game on their schedule. As a recruiter, has illustrated to many around the country that O’Brien’s schemes on the field are equally matched by his ability to provide what recruits are looking for in a coach and in a program.
 

The QB competition seems to be between JuCo transfer, it’s assured that O’Brien will pick the QB that is the better decision maker and, as he’s said previously that understanding the offense is his biggest priority in a starting QB. 


The 2013 season has a few different obstacles standing in the way of greatness-- a shaky outlook on the QB, the staff is a testament to why many Penn State fans have high hopes for 2013.

###Program details:

**The /r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund is a GO!**

Some of use here at /r/cfb have decided it would be fun to donate towards a brick at Baylor's new stadium ([details on the program here](http://www.baylor.edu/stadiumbricks/)).

###**Ground Rules**

Before I get into anything about sending money

* We will not be trying to troll Baylor with the brick's message. The fact that a mix of alumni from throughout the country have donated a reddit brick is kind of unique and bizarre on its own. **By ""not trolling"" I mean no *outright insults* of Baylor. Witty messages are fine, I need to be able to credibly defend the message if it gets questioned, I'm results-oriented.**

* There won't be room to put any usernames on the brick

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone

* The base amount for donation is $10. If you want to donate more

*  To be fair to those who donate more, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will violate the ""no-trolling"" clause and is only a message from /r/CFB. 

* The brick prices go all the way to $1250. If we go over a particular amount

* The funds will initially go to *my WePal account* and I will donate those funds to Baylor. I will do my damnedest to be transparent about where the funds are and how much we have. 

* There is no hard deadline at the moment

My hope is we can use this same model if the idea ever comes up again in the future. 

###**Payment Selection**

My goal was to find a payment service that offered the least restrictions and the lowest fees (so more of your money will go to the brick). After looking through a variety of sites (including PayPal, I decided to go with WePay. WePay offers the least restrictions (e.g. we don't have to meet a set goal), and low rates if we either set up a donation buttons *ourselves on our own website* OR *invoicing*. Since I don't have a website ready to go, I am going to do the invoicing option. 

###**How to Donate**

If you want to donate to our **/r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund** please use the following steps:

* [**Send me a Reddit message**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Honestly_) with (1) the amount you want to donate and (2) your preferred email address (you could post it here

* I will use WePay to invoice you at the email for that amount

* I will update this post with the usernames/flair of those who've successfully donated

* Finally, but I should say that. If you don't see yourself listed after paying, or you have other concerns, please contact me and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

BCS DECLARES GERMANY WINNER OF WORLD WAR II… US Finishes Ranked 4th

After determining the Big-12 championship game participants the BCS computers were put to work on other major contests and today the BCS declared Germany to be the winner of World War II.

“Germany put together an incredible number of victories beginning with the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland and continuing on into conference play with defeats of Poland, Sweden, Denmark,Belgium and the Netherlands. Their only losses came against the US and Russia; however considering their entire body of work–including an incredibly tough Strength of Schedule–our computers deemed them worthy of the #1 ranking.”

Questioned about the #4 ranking of the United States the BCS commissioner stated “The US only had two major victories–Japan and Germany. The computer models, equally-weighted event.”

German Chancellor Adolph Hitler said “Yes
forces.”

The French ranking has also come under scrutiny. The BCS commented “France had a single loss against Germany and following a preseason #1 ranking they only fell to #2.”

Japan was ranked #3 with victories including Manchuria,False,self,t5_2qm9d,False,,ohiostate,t3_no692

Normally I would get intimidated by such a thing. But not today. No, and I'm angry, the man who couldn't stop a pop warner offense managed to hold up traffic in the middle of the day. 


As we lock eyes my stare only become more frightening. Boys let me tell you, the look of helplessness, a look saying ""oh God, what have I done."" I decide to spare the man and continue my journey, but he and I both know I have unfinished business.

**Rivals**

*Alabama-*

 (The Third Saturday in October) This is the biggest rivalry Tennessee has from a historical perspective. Since 1901, Bama won 11 in a row, with UT winning 4 straight before and after this streak. Then, Bama won 9 in a row from ’86-’94. From ’95-’01, UT won seven in a row, and Bama has won the last six. This is Tennessee’s longest standing rivalry, and has been played every year since 1928. And, you can’t talk about The Third Saturday in October without including [this video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt2BAfhUHX0).

*Florida-*

If Alabama is Tennessee’s oldest rival, with the winner of the UF-UT game winning the East Division eight out of ten years. This decade long fight pitted Steve Spurrier and Phillip Fulmer against each other, both on and off the field, leading to a pretty fierce hatred for Spurrier in Vol Nation. Florida leads this all time series 23-19. 

*Kentucky-*(formerly the [Battle for the Beer Barrel](http://imgur.com/hg18WUz)) 

Not a whole lot to say about this game

*Vanderbilt-*

The UT-Vandy rivalry, Vanderbilt was absolutely dominant, winning 19 of the first 23 matchups. Then, after the hiring of Robert Neyland in 1926, the rivalry turned in favor of the Vols, and from 1927 until Neyland’s retirement in 1952, the Vols won 19 of 24 meetings. In recent years, with the hiring of James Franklin by the Commodores and the troubles the Vols have had. Overall

**THE GREATS:**

**Greatest Games:**

[1986 Sugar Bowl vs Miami](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1GxwqZ00iU) – Most of you have seen ESPN 30 for 30’s “The U”, but the Vols annihilated the Canes, sacking Vinny Testaverde 7 times for losses totaling 84 yards en route to a 35-7 victory.

[The Miracle At South Bend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOXrjUGBIIM) – Down 31-7 just before halftime in South Bend versus the #5 Fighting Irish

[“The Day the Cannon Didn’t Fire”](http://blogs.knoxnews.com/mattingly/2007/11/the-day-the-cannon-didnt-fire.html) – Coming into Knoxville ranked #1, led by their 1959 Heisman winner-to-be Billy Cannon and Chinese Bandit defense, were flying high after beating rival Ole Miss in the famous Halloween game the week before. Anticipation for the game was high and Vol fans had lined up at the [L&amp;N rail station](http://imgur.com/PDbTcoz) to watch the Champion Tigers come into town, especially Cannon who had obtained celebrity status amongst southern football fans. The game was decided shortly after LSU had cut the Vol’s lead to 14-13 with an early 4th quarter touchdown. After the touchdown, LSU’s Coach Dietzel decided to go for 2 with a play that had worked well for LSU, the pitch right to Cannon. Tennessee [stuffed Cannon at the Northeast endzone’s goal line](http://imgur.com/P7hP6jv) in what has gone down in Tennessee lore as simply “The Stop”.

**Random Trivia:**

Tennessee acquired its name ""The Volunteer State"" in the early days of the nineteenth century in the War of 1812. At the request of President James Madison, mustered 1500 from his home state to fight the Indians and later the British at the Battle of New Orleans. The men never actually fought in battle and Jackson was so frustrated by the inactivity that he marched the men home at his own expense and his determined stance on their behalf earned him the nickname ""Old Hickory."" The name became even more prominent in the Mexican War when Gov. Aaron V. Brown issued a call for 2800 men to battle Santa Ana and some 30,000 Tennesseans volunteered.
 

Steve Spurrier, as Athletic Director, not been so reluctant to let Bowden Wyatt and his other predecessors abandon the Single Wing offense.

Despite its historical success on the field (8th all-time in wins), Heath Shuler, and Peyton Manning were all runner-ups for the award.

The iconic checkerboard endzones were first introduced in the ’60 when Doug Dickey was head coach; they are a representation of the checkerboard pattern on the top of Ayers Hall

Smokey became the mascot in the early ‘50s after a vote by the student body; the bluetick hound won in a landslide.

Rocky Top is not UT’s actual fight song; that’s [Down the Field](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5FUv0RLrj8).


**What Is and What Is to Come:**

Looking at the schedule, and realistically somewhere in between actually happening. On offense, despite losing most the skill players in what was possibly the greatest offense in school history, Tennessee returns 6 out of 7 major contributors along the offensive line, as well as all of the running backs and some quality slot receiver back-ups from last year. Early reports out of spring practice have Justin Worley as the starter at QB, but his battle with redshirt freshman Nathan Peterman probably won’t be completely settled until fall camp.
On defense, to Florida State. Tennessee will still be faced with having speed that is deficient relative to UF, Oregon, UGA, Bama, etc., but being in good position and actually being coached in the fundamentals should give Tennessee’s defense an actual prayer

*Traditions*
****
* [The Masked Rider leads the team onto the field in one of the best and most celebrated entrances in CFB.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KLmj543NPk&amp;) The tradition originated in 1936 after student George Tate borrowed a horse from the Tech agricultural barn as a prank and lead the team onto the field. It did not resurface until the 1953 Gator Bowl

    Ed Danforth, and predates USC's Traveller and FSU's Renegade.

    The charge is commemorated in [statue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/MRstatue.jpg) [form](http://i.imgur.com/UE1QxPd.jpg) outside the stadium. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcW7Up7nIaU) is another video from field level demonstrating the absolute wall of noise generated by the tradition and the field's location below street level.

Campus legend holds that the statue's ass was rotated precisely 23 degrees to face towards College Station. The tradition of wrapping arose after the statue was [vandalized](http://i.imgur.com/OunUZe7.png) by Aggies in the late 60s.

*Random Trivia*
***

* The Sept. 18, a Texas Tech alumnus, pioneered the equipment used by coach JT King to review plays immediately. However, the new twist was eliminated by the NCAA in 1967 because the technology was too costly for some schools.
     
* The campus is tremendously large and it can take 30 minutes of walking to get from a parking lot to the building your class is in.

* The campus has been called 'the most beautiful campus west of the Mississippi until you get to Stanford' by Pulitzer Prize winning author James A. Michener. Steward Mandel agreed.
     
* The ""father of the national letter of intent

* The Class of 1938 donated a [large](http://i.imgur.com/2Xa2WbA.jpg)) neon Double T sign that currently hangs on the stadium facade. The sign was reportedly the largest neon sign in existence at the time.

* Many fans believe that a lack of an indoor practice facility combined with the excessive winds of West Texas generate a significant homefield advantage for Texas Tech quarterbacks. As they practice frequently in the wind and opposing teams do not

* Texas Tech is, Tech was responsible for developing the Enhanced Fujita scale used to rate tornado strength. The Wind Science and Engineering Research Center was founded after a devastating F5 tornado swept through downtown Lubbock in 1970, causing more than $1.4 billion in damage and 26 deaths. The tornado is also responsible for the relative lack of large trees and greenery in central Lubbock, and the [Metro Life building](http://i.imgur.com/8sbF68F.jpg) downtown is the second tallest building that has survived a hit from an F5 tornado.

* Since Kliff Kingsbury's first season as a starting quarterback in 2000

* Texas Tech is the only team to ever have 5 or more players with at least 60 catches in a single season. In 2003: Wes Welker (97), Nehemiah Glover (77) and Carlos Francis (75)

* Texas Tech was involved in one of the strangest games in college football history. A 0-0 tie with Centenary in 1939 was played in a driving rainstorm and featured an NCAA-record 77 punts (67 on first down). ) Charlie Calhoun still owns the NCAA record for number of punts in a single game. He punted 36 times for 1

* [](/washington) **U of Washington: The Apple Cup**

From the Cougar standpoint

 University of Washington is the most heated game on the schedule each year. This 

classic rivalry first met way back in 1900 which resulted in what I am sure was a 

killer match ending in a 5-5 tie. 

The game became the ""Apple Cup"" in 1962. Since then both sides have fought whole 

heartedly for the right to display the [trophy](http://i.imgur.com/Lw4fedq.jpg)  and to have [bragging rights that year](http://i.imgur.com/kGyFI6W.jpg). This 

electrifying game occurs around Thanksgiving

Holding the advantage

ultimately whenever one side has a strong year

shut down their dreams. One of these games happened in 1982 when a considerably 

klutzy  2-7-1 Cougar team hosted the 5th ranked Huskies who were poised to enter 

into their third straight Rose Bowl. The Cougs dug deep and [pulled out a 24-20 win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=X8c3IzJnFu0#t=21s). An 

ecstatic cougar fan base stormed the field

slinging them into the Palouse river. Since then

* [](/idaho) **Idaho: The Battle For The Palouse**

The University of Idaho is located [only 8 miles away from the WSU campus](http://goo.gl/maps/T89Wv) and thus a natural rivalry was born. The overall record is 70-18-3 in favor of the Cougs but we still take the rivalry very seriously. The proximity of the rivalry has spawned at least one funny tradition over the years

*THE GREATS:*

**Greatest Games:**

* [1992 Apple Cup - the Snow Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/vTvh0BL.jpg) One of the most cherished moments by our fan base occurred in what possibly might have been the worst weather conditions the Apple Cup has even seen.  The Cougs, defending national champion husky team led by Mark Brunell. However, neither the huskies or the fierce -18 degree wind whipping weather could stop Drew Bledsoe and the Cougars as they put together a 29-point third quarter. This barrage of scoring included one of the [most replayed highlights of cougar football.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykkSTEcVdg). The lead provided a cushion that UW would not be able to overcome the rest of the game resulting in a 42-23 victory for the Cougs. The win led to a berth to the Copper Bowl where the Cougs maintained their momentum and defeated Utah.

* [2003 Holiday Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/UYDNfj6.jpg) The 15th ranked Cougars entered the Holiday Bowl heavily unfavored against the 5th ranked Texas Longhorns. Battling a team that contained RB Cedric Benson and RS QB freshman Vince Young, allowing the Cougs to go on a 19-0 run in the third quarter. Texas responded in the fourth quarter with two scores to pull within 8 points, but the cougar defense displayed their dominance once again denying the Longhorns on two separate drives [late in the game to secure a victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81ugkLbI7WA). The comeback allowed the cougars to hit the 10-win plateau for the third straight year, going 30-8 in that time span.

* [1997 Apple Cup:](http://i.imgur.com/F9xrpQX.jpg) Entering the game, the huskies crawled back to within 3 and threatened the cougar’s lead. Leaf then connected once again with Jackson for a 50-yard TD pass showing he had his sights set on the Rose bowl. The Cougs held on til the end eventually winning 41-35. They then went to Pasadena where they unfortunately fell to #1 Michigan.

* [2008 Apple Cup - The Crapple Cup:](http://i.imgur.com/r9HbAOr.jpg) It may not have been one of the greatest games, WSU entered the game as an 8.5 point underdog to the 0-10 Huskies. The match was a bit painful to watch for the first 59 minutes of game time, but with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, QB Kevin Lopina hit WR Brandon Gibson to convert a third-and-1 and led the Cougs on a 69-yard drive that would result in a FG to send the game into overtime tied at 10. During the first OT, the Cougs went up a field goal only to be matched by the Huskies. In the second OT, Husky K Ryan Perkins missed wide right from 37 yards setting up a chance for victory for the Cougs. After only advancing a mere 5 yards, WSU K Nico Grasu [drilled his attempt from 37 yards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXmzb_5lDk) sending the team, into a frenzy on the field. The defeated Huskies would eventually lose their final game against Cal to become the first team in the Pac-10 to go 0-12 and the only team in the country to finish the season without a win in 2008.

**Greatest Plays:**

* [Why not just watch a video?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1wu9Aoa9vLA) Lots of good ones in there including some stingers against Texas, Notre Dame and of course the Dawgs.

* [And here is an instant classic from last years Apple Cup.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vOofoyYTM80#t=425s)

**Greatest Players:**

* Drew Bledsoe - **4x Pro Bowl, Super Bowl Champion QB**. Also the owner of [Doubleback Winery](http://www.doubleback.com/) in his hometown of Walla Walla in Eastern Washington (which is a great wine region) The only time I have seen this wine for sale, it was $100 a bottle at Wine World. So it’s likely quality.

* Mark Rypien - **Super Bowl MVP, Idaho and Colorado State going into his junior season.

* Mel Hein - **NFL Hall Of Fame, 2x NFL Champion, The only OL to win MVP, 1930s All-Decade Team, NFL 75th Anniversary Team**. Mel Hein was a beast among men. He lead the Cougars to an undefeated 1931 season and into the Rose Bowl against Alabama. He was an All-American at WSU and also played Center on the WSU basketball team. His number is retired by both Washington State University and the New York Giants. 

* Marcus Trufant - The 11th overall pick by the Seattle Seahawks sealed Trufant’s legacy in history as not only an all time great for the Cougars and Seahawks, First-Team Pac-10 and Second-Team All-American during his years with the Cougs. He allowed **zero** TDs against him in his final two season at WSU.

* Jason Hanson - Hanson is another Spokane native that played for WSU. He holds the record for longest kick in WSU history at 62 yards. An All-American in his Sophomore season he also holds the WSU records for points scored (328) and most field goal related records. He had one of the longest NFL careers of anybody and retired this year after 20 seasons. He is the #3 all time leader in points in the NFL as well as the #3 leader in field goals made. Hanson is a 2x Pro Bowler and 3x All-Pro.

* Ryan Leaf had a magnificent career at WSU, busts in NFL history. He was selected 2nd overall in the 1998 draft behind Peyton Manning by the San Diego Chargers. Once his NFL career ended, he entered into a coaching position at West Texas A&amp;M. Here, not only his coaching career, but his life spiraled out of control as it became evident he had a serious drug addiction problem with painkillers. After years of probation, rehab, burglary, and continued drug abuse, he averaged 330.6 yards passing per game and threw for a then Pac-10 conference record 33 touchdowns. Everyone hopes Leaf will pull his life together

**Greatest Coaches:**

* **Mike Price (1989-2002) 83-78** -  Price was good friends with Dennis Erickson and when Erickson left WSU for Miami he recommended Price for the job. Price rented Erickson’s home and ended up staying in Pullman for 13 years. During that span he won 3 bowl games and led two Rose Bowl squads in 1997 and 2002. Price coached many famous WSU players including Drew Bledsoe

* **Jim Walden (1978-1986) 44-52-4** - Jim Walden will always be great in the eyes of Cougar fans because he loved spoiling the Huskies’ season. He also ended a bowless streak that had gone on for 51 years by leading to the Cougars to the 1981 Holiday Bowl against the BYU Cougars. He also coached Cougar greats Jack “The Throwing Samoan” Thompson

[**Wave The Flag**](http://www.olcrimson.org/)

 The GameDay Wave The Flag movement first began back in 2003 when the Cougs were ranked 6th in the nation. It started off as a simple showing of school pride and spirit but quickly evolved into a campaign to bring GameDay to Pullman. It has since then become a tradition to have a cougar flag

*What Is and What Is to Come:*

As the offseason lags on, linebacker Travis Long, and estranged WR Marquess Wilson. However, despite these losses, WSU will not be lacking in experience. Wazzu leads the PAC-12 in [returning career starts with 359](http://espn.go.com/photo/preview/130401/espn_returning_starter_counts2.pdf), including up and coming players such as QB Connor Halliday, WR Gabe Marks, S Deone Bucannon

This recruiting season may not have been a flashy one (ranking between 9-11 with Rivals, and 247) but Leach bulked up on where we needed improvement the most: both the offensive and defensive lines. One of the most exciting prospects 4* AZ QB Tyler Bruggman led WSU into a bit of a panic on signing day when he flip flopped between ASU and WSU, but he eventually confirmed his committed with the Cougs at the end of the day. When asked about the drama on signing day, Leach stated he was unaware of any offers to Bruggman from ASU, but that he did receive an excellent [lasagna recipe from Bruggman's mother the night before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=7fvyuhLf5qE#t=545s).

The schedule this upcoming season provides WSU ample opportunity to improve on last years record of 3-9.  The non-conference line up includes games at Auburn, Arizona St, and Utah and will travel to play USC, Cal, Oregon, Arizona and UW. Worst case scenario would be a repeat 3-9 record, with only being able to scrounge a single conference win and having two close calls against nonconference foes S. Utah and U of I. Best case scenario (in my completely biased and homeristic opinion) would be a 10-3 record and an appearance in the Rose Bowl, becoming bowl eligible would be welcomed warmly by a fan base who hasn't seen the Cougs in a bowl for a decade.

That's exactly how pedestrian Te'o's numbers are.  I'm not discounting the value of having a winning team (UGA was 9-4 in 2006) but I think we can all agree that this Te'o hooplah is based on the love for Notre Dame and the sexy idea of having a truly defensive player win it.

**National Titles:**

1957 with coach Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan and 2010 with Coach Gene Chizik

**Rivals:**

**[The Iron Bowl](http://i.imgur.com/Fxpdrit.jpg):** Alabama and Auburn have played 77 games starting in 1893. The games were originally played on Legion Field in Birmingham, and Alabama has a famously large fanbase. But to be fair, most of Alabama's[[1]](http://i.imgur.com/gIH99Xj.jpg) fans[[2]](http://i.imgur.com/dT5jGhD.jpg) are[[3]](http://i.imgur.com/Nz75KyG.png) really[[4]](http://i.imgur.com/aMCPOu8.jpg) normal[[5]](http://i.imgur.com/mmZtgR4.jpg) people[[6]](http://i.imgur.com/YcVvh1x.jpg) just[[7]](http://i.imgur.com/RYdaFOL.jpg) like[[8]](http://i.imgur.com/2ljWpxY.jpg) you[[9]](http://i.imgur.com/pEenEHa.jpg)! The Iron Bowl is a nationally famous game that, not regarding Auburn's less than stellar [performance](http://i.imgur.com/hEeL7Qq.jpg) last year, typically proves to be a solid [matchup.](http://i.imgur.com/9e0kUee.jpg) **Sidenote: With Alabama winning the national title last season, the state of Alabama has 4 consecutive National Championships, which is the current record. In favor of Alabama

**[The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry:](http://i.imgur.com/m3EFp9A.jpg)** Beginning in 1892, is always a tossup. This rivalry is the oldest in the southern states, and the two teams have played each other every season since 1892 barring three games interrupted by WWI and WWII. **Side note: the first game we played in 1892 is credited as the game where the ""War Eagle"" chant was coined, when Auburn went on to win 10-0. 

""It's a unique thing. It's like playing against your brother. I don't think anybody who plays in that game can ever forget it. It just doesn't matter much where it's played or what somebody's record is. It's so intense and tough

**[Tiger Bowl:](http://i.imgur.com/v7gtXPU.jpg)** LSU and Auburn have played 47 games since 1901. Another big tossup game. Both teams usually play very well against each other (as seen in the 2012 season) and every game typically has an edge-of-your-seat ending. **Side note: It is referred to as the Tiger Bowl due to the fact both Auburn and Lsu have Tiger Mascots. Clearly though

**[Auburn-Florida](http://i.imgur.com/m6ITaVI.jpg):** 83 games since 1912. In favor of Auburn with 43-38-2

**[Auburn-Georgia Tech](http://i.imgur.com/q4rgie3.jpg):** 92 games since 1892. Many fans want this rivalry rekindled; last game played was in 2005. In favor of Auburn with 47-41-4

**[Auburn-Tennessee](http://i.imgur.com/kjd6qKx.jpg):** 51 games since 1900. In favor of Auburn with 27-21-3

**[Auburn-Tulane](http://i.imgur.com/zDkGUI0.jpg):** 37 games since 1902. In favor of Tulane

**[Auburn-Clemson](http://i.imgur.com/fQa3BZy.jpg):** 48 games since 1899. In favor of Auburn with 34-13-2

**2012 Season:**

[Record](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/schedule/_/id/2/auburn-tigers) 3-9 (0-8)
Coached by [Gene Chizik](http://i.imgur.com/c8805rL.jpg)

**[2012 Roster](http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/roster-mtt.html)**

**Key Players:**

[Tre Mason](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/511828/tre-mason): Tre Mason lead our team in rushing yards as a sophomore. He had 171 carries for over 1000 yds. He averaged 5.9 with 8 TDs. Mason was and will be a solid RB who can be relied on to get us some yards. [Ontario McCalebb](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/480385/onterio-mccalebb) ran for 570 yds with 94 carries. He averaged 6.1 yds and ended the season with 6 TDs. Where Mason was our strongman

[Emory Blake](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/480370/emory-blake) led our receivers with 50 receptions for 789 yds. He averaged 15.8 yds and had 3 TDs. 

[Kiehl Frazier](http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/515946/kiehl-frazier) He had 62 completions out of 116 attempts for 753 yards. He had 2 TDs and 8 Interceptions. I couldn't really leave our QB out of this section, but it's all speculation and he was eventually benched in favor of freshman Jonathan Wallace. 

**Biggest Plays:**

[Tre Mason's 83 yd run for a TD.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljM6v8fCuJY) Yes, watching Mason get this TD just felt great. 

[Sammie Coates' hail mary reception](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbUe5Bah_Wg) Oh man

[Cody Parkey game-winning FG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WECSnFW13Zc) After two losses

And my personal favorite: [Daren Bates' Fumble recovery TD with a brutal stiff arm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuBBdJfw9V8) 

**2013 Season:**

**[Schedule](http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/aub-m-footbl-sched-2013.html):** I think we have a favorable schedule to play in 2013. I expect LSU, and Alabama to be our most difficult games next year, with a chance of an upset over LSU and UGA. 

**The Greats:** 

**Greatest Games:** 

**Iron Bowl- 1982 ""Bo over the top"":** With two minutes remaining

**Athens- 1983:** After narrowly losing at home to UGA in the only matchup of Bo Jacson and Herschel Walker

**SEC Championship Game 2010:** Wiki game notes- ""The No. 1 ranked BCS team had lost its conference championship game three seasons in a row and Auburn ended the record this year. Auburn broke the SEC Championship Game records for most offensive yards

**Iron Bowl- 1989:** This would be the first Iron Bowl played in Jordan-Hare Stadium. There was plenty of complaint from angry Alabama fans demanding we play on Legion Field, the final score was 30-20, and marked four straight Iron Bowl wins for Auburn. **Side note, the ""Tiger Walk"" reached legendary proportions with 20,000 fans lining the block to pump up the team. 


**And of course, and as many would agree, the best football game Auburn ever played. The Tigers were getting smacked down in the beginning, with a 24-0 deficit. Cam rallied the team to throw for three touchdowns and running one in himself to win 28-27. It was the biggest comeback in school history, and solidified Cam's run for the Heisman and Auburn's chances of going to the BCS Championship. 

**Greatest Plays:**

**[Bo Jackson ""over the top"":](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDeAWbxgTfE)** Explained above; won us one of our best games/iron bowls. 

**[CFA Bowl Statue of Liberty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPiFUF-dTi4)** I personally just loved seeing this kind of creativity and it helped win us our fifth straight bowl game. Especially since the 2012 season was so devoid of any creativity haha. 

**[Cam Newton/2010 team best plays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2vbPJJL5Pg)** Couldn't pick my favorite Cam play

**Best Players**

**Pat Sullivan:** Quarterback during the Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan era

**Bo Jackson:** Running back for Auburn from 1982-1985 for a total of 4

**Cam Newton:** Quarterback in the 2010 season,473 yds for 20 rushing TDs. Cam won the Heisman Trophy, becoming Auburn's third Heisman recipient.

**Greatest Coaches:** 

**Ralph ""Shug"" Jordan:** (1951-1975) Half of our stadium's namesake

**Pat Dye:** (1981-1992) Pat Dye was Auburn's head coach during some of the best games and seasons Auburn has had. He coached Bo Jackson, with a record of 99-39-4. Auburn's football field is named after him. 

**Traditions:**

**Tiger Walk:** Before each Auburn home football game, and thousands did. Today the team walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk. Every Auburn Student is expected to participate at least once before graduating!

**""War Eagle"":** So there are several versions of the origin of the ""War Eagle"" tradition (Wiki has a different version if you are interested), there was an old civil war veteran who had a pet eagle that he had rescued during the war. Some versions say he was just a local, others say he was a professor. Either way, fast forward to Auburn's first football game against UGA. The game was tied 0-0 and was beginning to wind down. The Tigers had driven towards the opposing endzone, and needed to score. Just then, the eagle flew off the Veteran's shoulder and began to circle the field (just like our current eagles do before a home game). A student recognized it as the Veteran's ""war eagle"", and began to shout, it's the war eagle!"" Everyone began to point and chant ""war eagle"" to encourage the football team. It worked, our battle cry (much like ""go dawgs

**Toomer's Corner:** The intersection of Magnolia and College streets in Auburn, a small store on the corner that has been an Auburn landmark since 1896. Hanging over the corner are two massive old oak trees, planted in 1937, and whenever there is cause for celebration in the Auburn community, toilet paper can usually be found hanging from the trees. Unfortunately, it is these same trees that Harvey Updyke, a disgruntled (and partially insane) Alabama fan poisoned with lethal amounts of tree killer. The trees will not survive, by transplanting new fully grown trees in their place and rolling something else (has not yet been determined) in the interim. The tradition began when the Toomer's drugstore owner heard about an Auburn away game win over the radio

*Rivals*
***

* Iowa State- Battle for the Cy-Hawk Trophy - [current Cy-Hawk Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/KCHuf3D.jpg)
 The Hawkeyes and the Cyclones originally began playing in 1894 but the two halted the series from 1934 to 1977 after fan vitriol between the two factions became too violent.  Iowa currently leads the overall series 39-21 though the Iowa State has won the last two.

* Minnesota- [Floyd of Rosedale](http://i.imgur.com/0RgWR8e.jpg)
In 1934 the Gophers routed the Hawkeyes 48-12 on their way to a national title, that even if the officials allowed the same kind of rough play in Iowa City the crowd would not (implying that Iowa fans would riot).  To diffuse tensions Minnesota Governor Floyd Olsen wagered Herring that the governor of the winning team’s state would be awarded a prize winning pig from the losing team’s state. Minnesota won the game fairly 13-6 and Minnesota was given a prize winning hog from Rosedale Farms in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The pig was later named Floyd of Rosedale in honor of the Minnesota governor and the name of the farm.  The pig died a few years later but the rivalry between the schools is symbolically represented by the bronze pig statue the teams now play for.  In 2008, Rivals.com named the Floyd of Rosedale the top rivalry trophy in college football. Minnesota currently leads the series 61–43–2.

* Wisconsin- Battle for the [Heartland Trophy](http://i.imgur.com/WrQuE1t.jpg). Although this rivalry is over 100 years old

The Hawkeyes wore all black helmets in remembrance for the victims of a mass shooting which occurred on the University of Iowa campus three days before the game. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUbzH-aND4)

* 2002 at Michigan: The Hawkeyes turned the Wolverines’ homecoming into a route, the worst home loss in Michigan history since 1967 and the worst homecoming loss for the Wolverine’s. [Link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eukaQpnTrf0)

* 2008 vs. Penn State: Iowa defeated national championship contender Penn State on a last second field goal to win 24-23 and give Penn St. it’s only loss of the season. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur0clGs3Rsk)


**Greatest Players:** 

* [Nile Kinnick](http://sportsthenandnow.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Kinnick-Heisman-2-300x233.jpg): Iowa’s only Heisman Trophy winner. Kinnick took the Hawkeye football team from nearly winless when he arrived to nearly undefeated when he left. The star player nearly every award in the country including Time Magazine’s “Man of the Year” (the first ever collegiate athlete to do so,866 punting yards.  Rather than play professionally, he joined the Navy where he later died due to a oil leak which caused his plane to crash during a training mission. Nile was known for his calm demeanor and overall kind-heartedness, which really showed in what some people call [the greatest Heisman speech of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiw8DD222Rw#t=00m57s)
      
* [Calvin Jones](http://i.cdn.turner.com/sivault/si_online/covers/images/1954/0927_large.jpg): The Steubenville
     
* [Alex Karras](http://i.cdn.turner.com/si/multimedia/photo_gallery/0910/cfb.heisman.moments.memorable.defenders/images/alex-karras.jpg): Karras played both offensive and defensive line for the Hawkeyes
  
* [Chuck Long](http://espn.go.com/photo/2011/0627/ncf_u_chucklong_cmg_400.jpg): Finished second in Heisman trophy voting in 1985 behind Auburn’s Bo Jackson.  The quarterback finished his career at Iowa with 9
      
* [Shonn Greene](http://img.fannation.com/upload/si_blog_post_images/t1_greene1216.jpg): 2008 Doak Walker Award winner after working for a furniture moving company just one year earlier.  Greene earned 100 rushing yards in every game of the 2008 season and was named the MVP of the 2009 Outback Bowl.
    
**Greatest Coaches:**
      
* [Howard Jones](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1302590/Howard_Jones.jpg): 42-17-1 overall record.  Jones coached Iowa from 1916-1923 before moving to USC and developing a dynasty there.  Jones oversaw Iowa’s most recent undefeated season and has the highest winning percentage of any Iowa football coach.
     
* [Forest Evashevski](http://hawkcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/s0910Evashevsk.jpg): 52-27-4 overall record.  Evy coached the Hawkeyes to two victories in the Rose Bowl (the only two in program history) and the 1958 National Title.  Evashevski was also the Iowa athletic director from 1960-1970.   
*  [Hayden Fry](http://i.imgur.com/DRPa1k8.jpg): Probably known best for the coaching tree he started at Iowa. Notable staff and players include: Kirk Ferentz, Barry Alvarez, Bret Bielema, Dan McCarney, and Bo Pelini. Fry held a 143-89-6 record at Iowa, coaching for over two decades a ded Iowa to three Rose Bowls.  The coach is also cedited with commissioning the Tigerhawk logo for Iowa athletics, adopting the Pittsburgh Steeler’s esque uniforms, the festival features a trade show
* Kirk Ferentz: 112-95 overall record. Currently the longest tenured coach in the Big Ten. Ferentz has won two Big Ten titles with Iowa (2002 and 2004) and won the first BCS level bowl game since the 1958 Rose Bowl (the 2010 Orange Bowl).  Ferentz’s recent lack of success has been a source of considerable angst among Iowa fans as the Hawkeyes have failed to record more than seven wins since the 2009 Orange Bowl run.  Further complicating matters is the cost of his buyout
    
****
*Traditions*
****

 * [The Swarm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKjV-lbsrCY) Iowa’s pregame involves holding hands and simply trotting onto the field behind the I-O-W-A flags as they enter Kinnick. This was implemented by Hayden Fry as a way to demonstrate that the team was unified prior to a game.
 * [The Visitor’s Pink locker](http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Sports/2013/04/05/1iowa-locker-roomsjpg.jpg) room at Iowa was painted pink by Hayden Fry, believed that pink was a passive color and that opponents would be lulled into a false sense of security.  Furthermore, Fry also meant to demean opposing players by using a color that was typically regarded as a “sissy” color that was used in little girls’ bedrooms.
 * The night before every Iowa home game current and former members of the Hawkeye Marching Band perform as part of the Beer Band
 * After every victory the Hawkeye Marching Band plays the Hawkeye Victory Polka (“In Heaven There is No Beer”).  The song was originally played after every score but the playing was banned briefly in 2000 as administrators believed that the polka promoted alcohol abuse.  After vociferous protests from students
 * Fry Fest- Every year on the Friday night before the first game, dinners, fundraisers, and guest speakers (namely Hayden Fry himself) as fans come together to celebrate everything Hawkeyes.
 * Iowa was recently ranked 2nd on the Princeton Review’s top party schools. Much of the reason for this is the tailgates that occur outside Kinnick Stadium and in the numerous bars around Iowa City on game day. Although alcohol is not served inside the football stadium

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
The Iowa football program is one of the most questionable teams in the country at this point. Although they are projected to finish as low as 11th in the Big Ten this year, as they have games at Ohio State, at Nebraska, and home against Michigan and Wisconsin. The team is currently in search of a starting quarterback, with the leading candidates being Jake Rudock and Cody Sokol, though neither of them have played a down of FBS football. Running back and o-line look to be solid as most players are returning as long as they can stay healthy (knock on wood). As long as the offense can stay on the field for more than a 3-and-out every drive like last year, our defense should be one of the better in the Big Ten. As Greg Davis’ offense enters it’s second year

*The Greats*

****

**Greatest Games:**

- 1960 college football season when undefeated and number three-ranked Minnesota met undefeated and number-one ranked Iowa in Minneapolis. The game was for the Big Ten Conference championship, 27-10.

****

**Greatest Players:**

- **Bronko Nagurski:**

Nagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at Minnesota from 1927 to 1929. In 1929

- **Laurence Maroney:**

At the University of Minnesota, but still became the first Golden Gopherand the third in Big Ten Conference history to rush for 1,000 yards in each of his first three seasons. He gained a total of 3,933 yards with the Golden Gophers and was a two time All-Big Ten First Team selection (2004–2005).

- **Marion Barber III:**

Like his father, they kept him at running back where he ranks fourth on the school's all-time rushing list with 3,276 yards, second with 4,495 all-purpose yards and second in rushing touchdowns with 35, one better than his father, Marion Barber Jr.. He also teamed up since his sophomore year with running back Laurence Maroney to form one of the best duo backs in college football,000 yards in consecutive seasons. He was an All-Big Ten selection in 2003 as a red shirt sophomore.

- **Sandy Stephens:**

Stephens was the first black man to play quarterback at the University of Minnesota and remains the only quarterback to take the Gophers to the Rose Bowl (1961 and 1962). In 1960, Stephens received the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player of the Big Ten Conference.

- **Tony Dungy:**

Finished his collegiate run as quarterback at the University of Minnesota

****

**Greatest Coaches:**

- **Bernie Bierman:**

(1932–1941, and completed five undefeated seasons. From 1942-44 he served in WWII

- **Lou Holtz:**

Holtz accepted the head coach job at the University of Minnesota before the 1984 season. The Golden Gophers had won only four games in the previous two seasons, 20–13. Holtz did not coach the Gophers in that bowl game, as he had already accepted the head coaching position at Notre Dame. His contract included a ""Notre Dame clause"" that allowed him to leave if that coaching job were to become available. Years later, the NCAA placed Minnesota on two years probation for 17 rule violations, two of which were committed by Holtz during his tenure.

****

**Greatest Rivalries:** 

- [](/iowa) - **Iowa:** [Floyd of Rosedale](http://i.imgur.com/ucdYlBK.jpg)

The 1934 Iowa-Minnesota games was one that started a strained relationship that would last decades, took hits that he thought were cheap and because of him being one o the few black players of the era. Iowa complained that the Gophers were piling it on, and dishing out blatant late hits in a game that ended with the Gophers winning 48-12. 

The following year, Iowa Governor Clyde L. Herring told reporters, ""If the officials stand for any rough tactics like Minnesota used last year, I'm sure the crowd won't."" Herring’s message was clear. “What he was saying was, ‘If you treat Ozzie like you treated him last year, we’re coming out of the stands,’” Simmons said. 

When this news reached Minnesota Bierman threatened to break off athletic relations with Iowa. Minnesota Attorney General Harry H. Peterson practically accused the Iowa governor of thuggery. ""Your remark that the crowd at the Iowa–Minnesota game will not stand for any rough tactics is calculated to incite a riot, cowardly and contemptible frame of mind.""

To lighten the mood, ""Dear Clyde, Minnesota folks are excited over your statement about the Iowa crowd lynching the Minnesota football team. I have assured them that you are a law-abiding gentleman and are only trying to get our goat. The Minnesota team will tackle clean, but, oh! how hard, Clyde. If you seriously think Iowa has any chance to win, I will bet you a Minnesota prize hog against an Iowa prize hog that Minnesota wins today. The loser must deliver the hog in person to the winner. Accept my bet thru a reporter. You are getting odds because Minnesota raises better hogs than Iowa. My best personal regards and condolences.

The Iowa governor accepted, the Minnesota players went out of their way to compliment Simmons, and Simmons praised the Gophers for their clean, hard-fought play. Minnesota went on to win their second straight national championship.

Governor Herring obtained an award-winning prize pig which had been donated by Allen Loomis, the pig was the brother of BlueBoy from Will Rogers' movie State Fair. A few days later, Governor Herring collected ""Floyd of Rosedale"" and personally walked him into Governor Olson’s carpeted office. 

Governor Olson later offered Floyd up as the grand prize in a state-wide essay-writing contest

Since the two schools could not continue wagering a live pig
 
- [](/wisconsin) - **Wisconsin:** [Paul Bunyan's Axe](http://i.imgur.com/OQFczvh.jpg)/ [Slab of Bacon](http://i.imgur.com/O21wU6n.jpg). Minnesota leads series 58-56-8

The trophy is a symbol of one of the most storied rivalries in college football, while the Badgers lead the Axe series 38-24-3.

The Paul Bunyan Axe was created by the Wisconsin letterwinners' organization (the National W Club) and would be instituted as the trophy in the series in 1948. The scores of each game are recorded on the axe's handle, they run to their own sideline, take the axe and carry it around the field. If the team not holding the trophy wins, they are allowed to run to their opponents' sideline and ""steal"" the axe away. Usually, after the winning team claims the axe, it is custom for the team to carry the axe to one of the goal posts and ""chop"" it down with the axe.

Previously the game was played for the “Slab of Bacon” trophy, it was presented to the winning school by a sorority from the losing school.

After the Gophers' 1943 victory, Dr. George Hauser, refused to accept it, stating he believed ""such trophies should be out for the duration"" (of World War II). The trophy disappeared and was replaced by Paul Bunyan's Axe in 1948.

The Slab of Bacon was missing until 1994

The Slab of Bacon is currently housed in the Wisconsin football office at Camp Randall Stadium. ""We took home the bacon


- [](/michigan) - **Michigan** [Little Brown Jug](http://i.imgur.com/lK7hFxF.jpg)

The earthenware jug

After Yost took over coaching the Wolverines in 1901, so Gopher fans were excited about possibly ending the Wolverines' streak.

As Yost and the team came into Minneapolis

Twenty thousand fans watched the matchup between the two teams in an overflowing Northrop Field. Minnesota held the fabled ""point-a-minute"" squad to just one touchdown, the Gophers reached the endzone to tie the game at 6. As clouds from an impending storm hung overhead, pandemonium struck when Minnesota fans stormed the field in celebration. Eventually the game had to be called with two minutes remaining. The Wolverines walked off the field, leaving the jug behind in the locker room of the University of Minnesota Armory.

The next day custodian Oscar Munson brought the jug to L. J. Cooke, although most believe it was accidentally left behind. Thomas Roberts, writing in 1956, stated that the jug had served its purpose, so he intentionally left it sitting on the field.

Still, which is Michigan's color) and commemorate the day by writing ""Michigan Jug –; Captured by Oscar, October 31, 1903"" on the side along with the score ""Michigan 6, Minnesota 6"". Of course, in the spirit of the moment, Minnesota's score was written many times larger than that of Michigan.

When the two schools met in football again in 1909, and the jug thus became the traveling trophy it is today. Michigan took home the jug in 1909 and 1910. Minnesota and Michigan met up again in 1919 after Michigan rejoined the Big Ten Conference, marking the first year that Minnesota won the jug outright.

**Local Dining:**

* [Al's Breakfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al's_Breakfast) is an icon in Dinkytown (one of the U's neighborhoods): 14 stools, downtown's [Hell's Kitchen](http://www.hellskitcheninc.com/) pre-dates the TV show and features all sorts of great items in a decor inspired by the owner's love of Ralph Steadman's deranged artwork. If you are feeling cheap on a date and you are paying for two, like I was when I went, get the walleye. 

* The [Jucy Lucy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jucy_Lucy), there are two places that claim to have invented it: [Matt's Bar](http://www.mattsbar.com/index.html) and the [5-8 Club](http://www.5-8club.com/). Of those two the usual winner is Matt's. The [Blue Door Pub](http://thebdp.com/) does modern takes that are popular, but the best non-traditional Jucy Lucy is actually at [Vincent](http://www.vincentarestaurant.com/) in downtown Minneapolis: the meat is a mix of ground beef and braised short ribs, stuffed with smoked Gouda and served with lettuce, tomato, and a toasted bun (the chef who invented it succeeded Andrew Zimmern at a local restaurant where he made a name for himself before the latter became super-famous)--it's so good the Vincent Burger was [introduced at the Twin's Target Field.](http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100329&amp;content_id=8981946&amp;vkey=pr_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min)

* Other campus hotspots: Mesa pizza is always full on the weekends because drunk people love mac and cheese pizza, I guarantee you will agree. We have a terrific selection if you want asian food. Panda of course, but also a place called Kowloon down Washington toward BK that has much better food and is pretty unknown around campus. Big Ten is awesome as well, with subs that are out of this world. A place called Annie’s Parlor with delicious malts and a view of downtown from their patio. 

* Bars: Sallys and Stubb and Herbs are two great bars on campus. Also

*Random Trivia/ Traditions*

* There are actually [two large campuses](http://campusmaps.umn.edu/tc/map.php?extent=full) that make up the main University of Minnesota: The Minneapolis (divided into East and West banks) and the St. Paul campus. The stadium and most of the traditional academic buildings are on the east bank of the Minneapolis campus. 

* The U’s Women’s Hockey Team has won 49 games in a row and are the 2 time defending national champions. [link](http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/streaks-alive-minnesota-womens-hockey-win-49-in-a-row-to-win-title/)

* The “Golden” adjective has not always been a part of the Gopher nickname. During the 1930

* From 1932 through 1941

* Ski-U-Mah, is more than 115 years old. In 1884, two Minnesota rugby players, John W. Adams and Win Sargent, tried to think of a fitting team yell. They used the word “Ski”, a Sioux battle cry meaning victory, and combined it with “U-Mah” (representing the University of Minnesota and rhyming with “rah-rah-rah”) to create a team cheer. The phrase stuck and was incorporated into both official school songs

* For the 2012-2013 season a defensive player wore #51 in honor of Gary Tinsley in every game

*Random tidbits:*

* The U was founded in 1851

* University faculty and graduates [have won 23 Nobel Prizes](http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/awards/national_intl/Nobel.html). Among them Norman Borlaug

* Open heart surgery was first successfully performed at the U

* A U professor and Earl Bakken

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

2012 was supposed to be the year of MarQueis Gray, who most Gophers fans despise, Shortell was not productive enough to keep his job so he was also benched and has since tranfered to Jacksonville State University in Alabama. Following Shortell’s underpreforming, the Gophers were forced to play Philip Nelson, a true Freshman that we had hoped to keep redshirted. Nelson preformed at a level better than most true freshman starters you see, but he still has a lot more room to grow. 

[Spring Game Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udSQXnwfgkI)

In 2013 I expect a lot from this team, along with Rodrick Williams who has three more years and has shown great ability that we expect from all the guys we bring up from Texas (Looking at you, /u/Alex_Mayes - btw, get your brother to come to the U and I will love you forever) and Berkley Edwards, brother of Braylon, coming in this year is really a good catch for us. We have also had our first 4 star commit in a while with RB Jeff Jones, hopefully he sticks around (class of 2014) We have a lot of questions at WR with a relatively young and inexperienced group. A guy who I expected to be great, has fallen off the radar completely, so hopefully he can spark the passing game. On Defense we have Ra’shede Hageman

**Cheerleaders:** [Pictures]( http://imgur.com/a/BwCuU)
   
**Stadium:** Mountaineer Field at [Milan Puskar Stadium]( http://imgur.com/a/wzxmB) - Built in 1980, it would be the largest in the state of WV. Capacity of 63,000. Largest ever crowd was 70,222 for a win against #4 Miami in '93, though fire regulation's now would never allow it to get to that capacity again.

**Number of Bowl Games:** 32 Total

**National Titles** (0) We've been undefeated twice
***
*Rivals*
***
* Pitt - Popularly known as the ""Backyard Brawl"".  Probably our most heated rivalry
* VT - Another dead rivalry
* MD - Maryland is like the kid in the corner of the classroom
* Louisville - I had a hard time making this list without them. We only played them for a short stretch recently when we both were in the BE

*Potential Rivals*

As you can see due to conference shifting WVU doesn't play a lot of it's traditional rivals so some new conference mates that might make good rivals in the near future.

* Texas - obviously one of the top dogs
* Oklahoma - Another top dog in the conference
* Oklahoma State - I consider Oklahoma State our most identical team in the Big 12. The fan bases seem similar
* Iowa State - Another school that reminds me of WVU a lot. An Iowa St. website dubbed it the Riot Bowl last year due to both schools student populations propensity to riot and burn things.

****
*Traditions*
****

* [Burning Couches](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u0D_L_IhbU) – WVU is infamous for their party atmosphere and have become known for street fires and riots year round but they’re typically ramped up around big football and basketball games.  
* [Country Roads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs-lrLfPqWU) – The popular song by John Denver has become somewhat of the unofficial song of the state and is sung after home victories.
* [First Down Chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWe6K-x3M2I) – Not as cool as some traditions
* [Simple Gifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXkEVWwOIGc) - Iconic pre game show from ""The Pride"" marching band. I had to choose a video of them practicing it since all the videos during the games there was to much cheering from the fans around the camera to hear anything.

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

**City Population:**

Quintessential college town. Morgantown's population swells to over 50, Pittsburgh (1 HR), Washington DC (3 HRS), Philadelphia (4 HRS), Cleveland (2.5 HRS) Baltimore (3.5 HRS) NYC (6 HRS), it isn't nearly as isolated as it can seem. Also close to countless outdoor activities in Wild and Wonderful West Virginia. Morgantown is consistently ranked by multiple publications among the best small towns in America. 

**City Skyline**

**Local Dining:** 

* [Mountain State Brewing Co.](http://morgantown.mountainstatebrewing.com/) – Local craft beer
* [Mario’s Fishbowl](http://mariosfishbowl.com/) -  A Morgantown staple for decades
* [Black Bear Burrito’s](http://blackbearburritos.com/downtown.html) – Not my personal favorite

*Random Trivia*
***

* Bobby Bowden’s first ever D1 head coaching position was at WVU. He had a decent record but after a few years locals were frustrated with a lack of progress and infamously hung him in effigy (according to him) and he left for the Florida State job soon thereafter. He still visits town and him and his sons all have strong ties to the area. 
* WVU is the most winning program in D1 without a national title
* WVU popularized the read-option that’s now taking over the NFL. Rich Rodriguez and Jedd Drenning created the play on accident while at Glenville State together; Rodriguez kept the play and used it over the years at Tulane and Clemson
* The [statue of a Mountaineer](http://i.imgur.com/lKUvl4J.jpg) that is located outside the Mountainlair (student union) was based on Jerry West
* The first ever college game to be broadcast on radio was the 1921 Backyard Brawl vs Pitt when KDKA out of Pittsburgh broadcasted it. 
* WVU legendary radio play by play man Jack Fleming was also broadcaster for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bulls. He was the play by play man for four Super Bowls and the Immaculate Reception for the Steelers. [Some of his best work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cifamRWqzE&amp;t=0m24s)

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
**2012** ended up being a disappointment, we fell off the face of the earth, losing our next 5 as our defense proved incapable of stopping anybody and our offense crumbled under the pressure of needing to score on every posession. We ended the season at 7-6 and went to lick our wounds. It wasn't surprising to me that our first year in a big boy conference had a lot of disappointment, we don't have the depth or the constant stream of recruits that most these teams do. We're working our way into it though and had the 3rd or 4th best recruiting class, depending on the source, in the conference for 2013 and have brought in a lot of immediate help at WR and on Defense.

**2013** should be interesting, Stedman and Tavon running the show. This will be somewhat of a rebuilding year, but I could see with a soft OOC schedule us being around the same record as last year. In either case, with the better national matchups and recruiting in the Big 12 and the innovative mind of Dana Holgorsen I think the future looks bright for the Mountaineers in 2013 and beyond.

***
*Overtime*
***

WVU is a unique University, this school and state have a special relationship that is unlike many other places, WV is a blue collar state with a hard luck attitude and we seem to get kicked around and beat up in terms of national news and relevance, but the one thing in the state that everyone is proud of is WVU sports teams, and when they're doing good it's like the state is doing good, and when they're doing bad, it's like the state is being embarrassed.

**Greatest Plays and Games:** 

In addition to some of the ones listed above, made last minute plays to take the lead, and taught Texas fans to never give up until the very last second has past. Here are a few recent ones, with clips.

* [*1969 ‘Game of the Century’ vs Arkansas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjFMW5uABzA)

&gt;Texas was unbeaten in 18 games and Arkansas had won 15 straight. Texas was ranked #1 by the AP poll and Arkansas was ranked #2. With Texas behind 14-8

I feel like an idiot for missing this one in the initial post. Thanks /u/No_Way_Pablo and the others suggesting this afterwards!

* [*1996 “Roll Left” vs Nebraska*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igWLuCfPnc4)

&gt;An unranked Texas team faced #3 Nebraska in the inaugural Big 12 Championship game. Texas up by only three points faced a 4th and inches call when James Brown rolled to his left and hit Derek Lewis for a 61-yard completion that set up the touchdown by Priest Holmes. Texas went on to win 37-27 and claimed the Big 12's first conference championship.

Great play! Thanks /u/Doonesbury

* [*2005 Rose Bowl vs Michigan*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU3ofrr8Jio)

&gt;Winning an at-large bid in the Bowl Championship Series, but Vince Young led two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter. Dusty Mangum kicked a 37-yard field goal as time expired to seal a 38-37 win for the Longhorns.

Our first Rose Bowl win

* [*2006 Rose Bowl vs USC; Vince Young’s Touchdown at 4th and 5*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=s8zZRBTOcnY)

&gt;#2 Texas defeated #1 Southern California 41-38 in the Rose Bowl to clinch a 13-0 season and its fourth national championship. The two teams had a combined 53-game winning streak and USC was playing for its third consecutive national title. Down 38-26 with 6:42 to play

* [*2008 Red River Rivalry vs Oklahoma; Jordan Shipley’s 96-Yard Kick Return*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLUWAzDAfc)

&gt;#5 Texas went into Dallas to face #1 Oklahoma. Down 14-3 early, Chris Ogbonnaya took off 62 yards down the sideline to put Texas in scoring position at the OU 2. Texas went on to win 45-35 and obtain their first #1 ranking in the polls since 1984.

* [*2009 Big 12 Championship vs Nebraska; “Last Second Field Goal”*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjZLxsxmBSc)

&gt;Two top 11 defenses clashed as #3 Texas faced #22 Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington

We ended up beating them at the last second, with ironically one of our worst teams ever), then left with OU giving them the boot. Thanks, /u/TeenRacer6 and the million other people who pointed it out. Oops. I must have been thinking about A&amp;M.

* [*2009 Fiesta Bowl vs Ohio State*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSTbhXqk6fk)

&gt;#3 Texas faced #10 Ohio State in the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. This was only the third meeting between the two storied programs with both teams winning once. Texas led 17-6 into the fourth quarter when Ohio State came back to lead 21-17. With under two minutes to play Texas quarterback Colt McCoy led the Horns on an 80-yard drive. Quan Cosby caught a 26-yard touchdown pass for the go-ahead score as Texas won 24-21. This was Texas' third straight victory in a BCS Bowl game and fifth straight bowl victory.

* [*2011 Our Last Lone Star Showdown vs A&amp;M*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBs1T_BRs7o)

&gt;Texas A&amp;M's last Big 12 game and the 118th meeting between the bitter rivals before the Aggies depart for the Southeastern Conference next season was a thriller befitting one of college football's oldest and most storied matchups. Justin Tucker kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give the Longhorns a 27-25 victory over Texas A&amp;M on Thursday night in the likely end of a more than century-old rivalry.
“Texas Fight! Texas Fight! And it’s goodbye to A&amp;M!” 

Thanks /u/sammaverick

**Greatest Coaches:** 

* [*Darrell Royal: 1957-1976*](http://www.sflonghorns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/darrell2004.jpg)

&gt;Darrell Royal is the best football coach ever for the University of Texas Longhorns.  Royal, leading the Longhorns to 16 postseason appearances and nine victories.  Royal won national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970, and won or shared 11 Southwest Conference championships.
Royal never had a losing season at Texas

The stadium bears his name. He recently passed away this year.

* [*Mack Brown: 1998-Present*](http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college/files/2010/08/coach_brown_mack.jpg)

&gt;Mack Brown is credited with reviving the Texas football program, Brown achieved his 200th career win, making him the first Texas coach to reach that mark.
Brown has a .796 winning percentage at Texas.  He has had 20 consecutive winning seasons, nine consecutive 10-win seasons and 10 consecutive nine-win campaigns for the first time in school history, though it must be noted that Texas played a maximum of only 11 games per season up until 1975 and only 12 games per season up until 1995 (including conference championship and bowl game).

Brown led the Longhorns to the national championship in 2005 and was the NCAA Coach of the Year.  He is one of the best coached in college football statistically

* [*Dana X. Bible: 1937-1946*](http://img.fanbase.com/media.fanbase.com/8/28142/ee24d7e2a8f4b9dd2a070870d1ec8a1cccb51d3c.jpg?x=549&amp;y=673&amp;sig=a101c7f17196974fa9890f2e356218bc)

&gt;Dana X. Bible is in the College Football Hall of Fame and the Longhorn Hall of Honor for a reason.  Bible was 63-31-3 with the University of Texas, his most impressive coaching season was at Texas A&amp;M, a season in which the team was undefeated, untied and outscored its opposition 275–0, was retroactively named a national champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation.” ^^^edit: ^^^added. ^^^Thanks, ^^^/u/FarwellRob

*What Is and What is to Come*
***

[Our 2013 Football Preview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSX5l9ZtpgI) sums it up nicely for us.

We showed improvements last year in comparison to the year before and certainly the year before that one. We finally settled in with a single quarterback. Our young team had gotten their feet wet. Longhorn fans had been in want for a few years now after the National Championship game, and with many more players returning this season, and a more determined and skilled third-year David Ash. During his ‘sophomore slump’ year, he managed to make some improvements in his game and is still improving. Our schedule for next season appears promising, with a decent balance of challenging and ‘esteem-building’ games, filled rematches against teams we lost to last year like TCU, K-State, or at least, less regret

**Here's the list of all the Heisman winners who will be at the shoot:**

* Sam Bradford – 2008 Winner
* Troy Smith – 2006
* Matt Leinart – 2004
* Carson Palmer – 2002

1371049667.0,1g76c7,[UPDATE] Remember the /r/CFB Baylor Brick? Five months later and it's approved!,Honestly_,276,41,89,"Hi Everyone

That /r/CFB Baylor Brick that's been hovering on in the background was finally approved this morning. It's obviously been a long wait

***
###Background
Five months ago a thread about Baylor's brick program for their new stadium resulted in jokes about creating a troll brick in Baylor's new stadium, which would probably fail, instead I wanted to get actual results). Despite some understandable misgivings, particularly from rival fans, we were able to get a serious fundraiser going--because why *not* have a group of college football fans on the internet crowdsource and donate a brick?

***
###The Money

Members of /r/CFB were very generous, I wanted to be very transparent and democratic. I created a separate private sub so the donors could discuss and vote in a fixed place with only other donors. On the flip side, transparency and democracy do take time, so it took a few weeks (I established week-long voting time periods) to establish, in order:

1. What is the message?
1. What size of brick accommodates the message?
1. What to do with the extra funds?

We had a round of suggesting messages and what to do with extra funds

So here's a quick summary of how the 3 steps turned out:

1. Two different Bible verses with ferocious bears in them split the vote at the top. We went with the verse that led in votes
1. The verse
1. The leftover **$665 went to the [Talitha Koum Institute](http://www.talithakoum.org/about.html)**

***
###The Delay

The decisions were made 4 months ago and the money was dutifully given to both organizations. Talitha Koum was *thrilled* by the surprise donation and I ended up talking to a few people there as they wanted to know more about how a random

Then there was Baylor. No doubt part of the delay was how the process was organized: 90% of my contact was through the brick company, courteous, and eventually helped find out what was causing the delay. Once the brick people received the funds and the message, the message was forwarded on to Baylor in a once a week grouping for approval. Approval was said to take 3-4 weeks. To try and grease the wheels, early on I actually called the donation department at Baylor to tell them the same story I told Talitha Koum: about who we were and how all these different people wanted to donate to Baylor. Well, at the end of the month or so, Baylor got back to us via the brick company: *your message is declined.* 

I can't say I was completely surprised, read it character-by-character, line-by-line. Then we waited... and waited... and waited...

[Yes, but at that point I figured I might as well stick to my plan]

I eventually re-contacted the Brick Company and the initially said they believed Baylor had rejected the second verse (uh oh), Texas had occurred so I wonder if that was an understandable distraction). I asked them to keep pursuing it (trying to toe the line between following-up regularly without being a problem) and, finally, this morning I got email confirmation that the second verse was approved. The certificate is in the mail, I will share it when it arrives. 

***
###The Message


    ""Like a bear  
    I will attack  
    and rip them  
    asunder!""  
    Hosea 13:8  
    /r/CFB  

(it will be centered on the actual brick)

###Parting Thoughts

In the end, Baylor works in its own unique way and it was slower than I (or really anyone) expected. We came up with a message that didn't insult Baylor, but was fun and was probably unique while also repping the sub.

___
*Rivals*
___
 [](/centralflorida) University of Central Florida (aka 'The War on I-4').

We were developing nice rivalries with WVU, but in the current conference configuration this should primarily be UCF, with schools like Cincy, SMU, and ECU in the mix.

___
*2012 Season*
___

**Record:** [3-9](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/58/south-florida-bulls)

**Coach:** Skip Holtz (now fired)

[2012 Roster &amp; Guidebook](https://admin.xosn.com/pdf8/871983.pdf?SPSID=37319&amp;SPID=2981&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;)

**Key Players**: Andre Davis

**Biggest Plays**: [**2012 SEASON HIGHLIGHTS**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-l2nQlGQQZ4#t=32s). Our big plays were few and far between. Take note of #81 Andre Davis (WR). He definitely has the potential to be an NFL receiver. He stands at 6-1 and 205 lbs and has some of the strongest hands I've seen.

Last year was a tough year. Coach Skip Holtz was supposed to be the guy that took the program to the next level, even though it was his third year, and he didn't. The offense was sporadic and the defense was non existent. 

Some people point the finger at BJ Daniels
___
*2013 Season*
___

**2013 Opponents** - 08/31 - McNeese State

09/07 - at Michigan State

09/14 - Florida Atlantic

09/28 - Miami (FL)

Unscheduled Opponents: Louisville, UCF, UConn, Houston, Rutgers


**2013 Roster** - n/a

The biggest storylines going into next year will be two things: Who will replace BJ Daniels, the outlook for this year is bleak. The general vibe here is that we will be lucky to make a bowl game.  Our defense last year only had 2 interceptions. 2 interceptions. In the whole season.

___
*The Greats*
___

**Greatest Games:** A win against #17 Auburn in 2007 really set up a magical year. Our program was 10 years old, #18 FSU in 2009, and #16 Notre Dame in 2011.

**Greatest Plays:** Grothe to Hester to win in OT at Auburn in 2007. Ben Moffitt pick-6 vs. WVU at home (Raymond James Stadium was on fire) [Video highlight here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=H_tdb-hGetc#t=125s)

**Greatest Players:** Jason Pierre-Paul (you're welcome, Marquel Blackwell, Matt Grothe, Mike Jenkins (current Cowboy CB)

**Greatest Coaches:** Jim Leavitt (now SF 49ers LBs coach) founded the program and built it from trailers to bowl games

___
*Traditions*
___

*What Is and What is to Come*
___

One of the most special things about USF is the way many fans view the program as their child, to playing in DII, to joining a BCS conference, to winning on some of the biggest stages in college football, you develop a closeness that is indescribable.

Our program has struggled badly to get over ""the hump"". We have bright spots and big upsets, who put together a top-50 recruiting class, we hope we get our swagger back and get over the hump.

___
*Overtime*
___

1. We are a respectable 8-9 in out-of-conference BCS games since joining the Big East, the quickest of any program. USF has a 60/40 female:male split.

*Traditions*
****
* Probably our most well-known gameday tradition: ""Guys in Ties, and as men are wont to do to impress others, they wore dress shirts, slacks and [blue and orange] ties. They would also bring their girlfriends to these games, and the girls would wear sundresses and pearl necklaces (weather permitting). The attire evolved over the years to include the occasional blazer, Sperry boatshoe, and of course, a bow tie. However

[Bonus picture of some fans wearing ties and pearls.](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png) [(pfs3w - I'm the guy with the obscenely orange glasses :P)](http://i.imgur.com/lYlGmzP.png)

* We refer to our campus as *Grounds*.

* Pre-Game: [The Adventures of Cav-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=zkI2g-bQ-jM) (**WARNING:** the speakers go really loud at the end of the video!)

* We have a fight song, in which we all join arms. The song has [gained some notoriety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Old_Song) in past years after students would add to the lyrics ""We come from old Vir-gin-ia, where all is bright and gay"", by chanting ""NOT GAY"". A petition successfully stopped this practice, and now we chant ""FUCK TECH!"" in reference to VirginiaTech instead. You can find the song [HERE](http://fightmusic.com/acc.html) if you search ""Good Old Song"".

*Random Trivia*
***
* UVA is the only college campus to be a designated *UNESCO* World Heritage Site.

* The original College was architected by Thomas Jefferson

* Maryland's grass thing is the only grass lawn larger than our own

* Wake Forest Head Coach Jim Grobe played football at UVA. Our greatest coach

* There is an acclaimed but unproven game of football that occurred just two years after the historic Rutgers-Princeton game that started college ball.

* The last time UVA held a series lead over VT in the Commonwealth Cup was in 1960, we've only won 1 of the last 15).

* UVA was involved in a controversy in 2002 at the inaugural Continental Tire bowl against West Virginia

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***

&gt; Mike London came in with the intent of changing the attitude toward recruiting and player development from the way Al Groh was running the program. London has placed an increased emphasis on recruiting in-state talent (with great success). I think when London first came on as head coach, and the inexperience on defense combined with underwhelming offensive production (particularly in the ground game, where we returned several good running backs and an offensive line with at least two potential first rounders) led to a poor record.

&gt; Unfortunately in this coming season

###Program details:

**The /r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund is a GO!**

Some of use here at /r/cfb have decided it would be fun to donate towards a brick at Baylor's new stadium ([details on the program here](http://www.baylor.edu/stadiumbricks/)).

###**Ground Rules**

I think it's helpful to have the basic rules so no one is later disappointed and we can all be on the same page:

* We will not be trying to insult Baylor with the brick's message. The fact that a mix of alumni from throughout the country have donated a reddit brick is kind of unique and bizarre on its own. Witty messages are fine, I need to be able to credibly defend the message if it gets questioned, I'm results-oriented.

* There won't be room to put any usernames on the brick

* People who donate will get to have ultimate say on what we write on the brick (suggestions welcome from everyone

* The base amount for donation is $10. If you want to donate more

*  To be fair to those who donate more, theoretically someone could just donate a ton of money and determine what we say--so long as the message isn't something that will violate the ""no-trolling"" clause and is only a message from /r/CFB. 

* The brick prices go all the way to $1250. If we go over a particular amount, donating to charity or helping add to /r/cfb prize money. 

* The funds will initially go to *my WePal account* and I will donate those funds to Baylor. I will do my damnedest to be transparent about where the funds are and how much we have. 

* There is no hard deadline at the moment

My hope is we can use this same model if the idea ever comes up again in the future. 

###**Payment Selection**

My goal was to find a payment service that offered the least restrictions and the lowest fees (so more of your money will go to the brick). After looking through a variety of sites (including PayPal, I decided to go with WePay. WePay offers the least restrictions (e.g. we don't have to meet a set goal), and low rates if we either set up a donation buttons *ourselves on our own website* OR *invoicing*. Since I don't have a website ready to go, I am going to do the invoicing option. 

###**How to Donate**

If you want to donate to our **/r/cfb Baylor Brick Fund** please use the following steps:

* [**Send me a Reddit message**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Honestly_) with (1) the amount you want to donate and (2) your preferred email address (you could post it here

* I will use WePay to invoice you at the email for that amount

* I will update this post with the usernames/flair of those who've successfully donated

* Finally, but I should say that. If you don't see yourself listed after paying, or you have other concerns, please contact me and I will do my best to keep you in the loop.

*Rivals*

***

* [](/tcu) **TCU** (Revivalry) - Our oldest, the first being the illustrious football powerhouse Toby’s Business College. We first faced off against each other on the gridiron in 1899 where we ground down to a 0-0 tie. More than a hundred games later, the series stands at 51-50-7 (with the slight advantage being held by the Frogs^(so close)), making this game one of the oldest and most even rivalries in all of college football. The rivalry extends past the football field as well, as the two schools shared Waco from 1895 to 1910, when TCU packed up shop after the administration building burnt to the ground. Popular urban myth holds that it was a bit of Bear Arson that led to the move. The rivalry runs deep on both sides.

* [](/texastech) **Texas Tech** - Baylor’s rivalry with Texas Tech is full of bitterness and hatred on both sides. Whenever these teams meet, this hatred often extends into dirty plays, from Women’s Basketball phenom Brittney Griner’s falcon-punch on Texas Tech’s Jordan Barncastle to Texas Tech’s targeting of Robert Griffin III’s head during his Heisman season. This series is also very close, currently at 36-34-1 in favor of Tech. ^(Not again.)

* [](/texasam) **Texas A&amp;M** (Battle of the Brazos) - The Baylor – A&amp;M Rivalry is another example of bitterness

*The Greats*    

****

**Greatest Games:**


* [2012 Baylor v #1 KSU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgpxT4c9su4): Baylor’s first ever victory over a #1 ranked opponent. This victory came at a time when no one expected Baylor to even making a bowl game


* [2011 Baylor v #14 TCU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmb6H8Kapto): The game that began the Heisman season.  This was a classic if there ever was one.  I remember the chants of “Heisman! Heisman!” that rang out through the stadium; no one in the stands knew that those chants would be answered.


* [2011 #22 Baylor v #5 OU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15r3q0jnQzc): This was the game to end all games.  Rushing the field after this game is probably the highlight of my collegiate career.  The pure joy after watching the strike to Terrance Williams that won the game was completely incredible. This was the first time Baylor had defeated OU and was one of the many great games that defined the 2011 season


* [1974 Baylor v #12 Texas](http://www.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/74/ut-bay.htm) - In the game that was the pinnacle of what was known as the ""Miracle on the Brazos

  

**Greatest Plays:** 


* [“The Immaculate Deflection”]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT34mwhaZMg): RGIII’s Heisman season, and this was about as lucky as it gets.


* [Terrance Williams catches the game-winner versus OU]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMm2qGMGV8Q): I freaking lost my mind when I saw this happen. I’ve already mentioned this play plenty in this writeup


**Greatest Players:**


* [LB Mike Singletary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Singletary): The original Baylor legend.  “Samurai Mike” Singletary holds the highest tackle total in Baylor history with 662 career tackles


* [QB Robert Griffin III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III): RGIII.  You might have heard of him.  He was at the core of the Baylor football revival over the past few years.  And oh yeah


* [RB Walter Abercrombie:]( http://www.baylorbears.com/genrel/abercrombie_walter00.html) Abercrombie played for the Bears from 1978-81


* [FS Thomas Everett]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Everett): A truly incredible defensive back


* [QB Don Trull](http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050713aaa.html): Two time winner of the Sammy Baugh award


* [P Daniel Sepulveda](http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/sepulveda_daniel00.html): What? A punter you say? Punter's usually don't get a lot of talk, fourth round draft pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Also, [check out this tackle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FhCgLeuO0I).

    

**Greatest Coaches:**


* [Grant Teaff] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Teaff): The All-Time winningest coach in Baylor Football history.  He led the Bears to 2 SWC titles and 8 bowl games during his career.


* [Art Briles]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Briles): Architect of the Renaissance of Football in recent Baylor history, and if he does, he could secure the position of the undisputed greatest coach in Baylor history.

*Traditions*

****

* **Baylor Line** - The Baylor Line is the embodiment of Baylor's spirit. The Line is made up entirely of freshmen who, at the front between the 20 and 40 yard lines ([the empty section in this photo](http://i.imgur.com/zKnKJ9V.jpg)). Each member of the Line receives a yellow jersey with their graduation year on it at *Line Camp*, a week during the summer where incoming freshmen learn the traditions and cheers of Baylor. They also have the option to customize the name on the back of the jersey.

* **Immortal Ten** - On January 22, and in Round Rock, as the bus passed over railroad tracks, a train struck the side of the bus. 10 of the 22 players and fans were killed in the wreck. One man, James Kelly, pushed his friend out of the way of the wreck at the cost of his own life. The accident shocked the entire nation. Each year, during homecoming

* **Homecoming** - Baylor has the oldest college homecoming tradition in the nation [according to historians](http://www2.baylor.edu/baylorproud/2012/10/baylor-homecoming-to-be-featured-in-upcoming-smithsonian-traveling-exhibit/), a bonfire, etc.


* **Diadeloso** (yes, classes will be cancelled and activities such as tug-of-war, beach volleyball, etc will take part on campus. For those who don't want to partake in university sponsored events, there's also ""Dia del 10th Street"" off campus which is essentially one big frat party.


* **The Eternal Flame** - To honor the memory of the Immortal Ten, students from Texas A&amp;M (as mischievous as they are wont to be) thought it would be a good idea to put out the flame, causing Baylor students to rise to defend it. As the years went on and Aggies stopped coming, the tradition morphed into Freshmen guarding the flame against upperclassmen. Upperclassmen employed various strategies to put out the flame, including water balloons, spies and brute force. Freshmen would form concentric rings around the flame, with students taking shifts in the rings to guarantee that the flame was guarded 24/7. In 2007, with students getting pelted with urine-filled balloons and others being sent to the hospital


***

*Campus and Surrounding Area*

***

**City Population:** 124

**City Skyline** - [Not much to see](http://i.imgur.com/M2CqcHn.jpg)

**Iconic Campus Buildings:** 


* [Pat Neff Hall](http://i.imgur.com/vdDN7NZ.jpg) is our most iconic building and is usually the first thing I look for as I drive on I-35 towards campus. It houses a [48-bell carillon](http://youtu.be/MmQcoQu0wzY) and usually go off every 15-minutes to remind people of the time. Although, and the National Anthem, depending on the occasion.


* [Baylor](http://i.imgur.com/8WyJMpp.jpg) [Science](http://i.imgur.com/ik8qAFI.jpg) [Building](http://i.imgur.com/6QGsEHm.jpg) (BSB) - This building is pretty new


* [Old Main/Burleson](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Old_Main


* [Carroll Science Building](http://i.imgur.com/OwEuTxL.jpg) - Home to our English classes. Seriously


* [Armstrong Browning Library](http://i.imgur.com/gdo20Jn.jpg) - Not our main library, making it a popular wedding venue. I hear the waiting list is two years long, which sort of leads to a mentality of ""get the venue first, get the guy later.""     


**Local Dining:**


* **Vitek's BBQ** - Home of the [Gut Pak](http://i.imgur.com/XRyDDbc.jpg), then about an hour later you take the biggest dump of your life. Then you sleep the rest of the day. And it's glorious.""


* **George's** - The chicken fried steak might be famous in the region, wrapped in bacon and deep fried to golden delcious-ness. The bar is a favorite of Pat Green, who [featured it in a song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxwVE_EGy7M) of his.


* **Kitok** - If you're not sure if you have a hankering for Korean food or a tasty burger


* **Shorty's** - Near campus


* **The Dancing Bear** - The Bear is best known as a quiet bar with some great beer on tap but you can also get food delivered from the next-door restaurant (Food for Thought). This is the best way to do it because Food for Thought is run by smelly hippies (in the literal and figurative sense) and you can get beer at the Bear.


* **Jake's Texas Tea Garden** - This is a recent addition to Waco fare and it has quickly proved to be a great one. Their burger's are top-notch


***

*Random Trivia*

***

* Baylor University is the oldest continually running university in Texas. As it was chartered in 1845


* The 2011 season is often called ""[The Year of the Bear](http://www.baylorbears.com/yearofthebear/)"" or ""Añodeloso."" Not only did Baylor have a breakout year in football with a 10-3 season and RGIII winning the Heisman, the Bears went 129-28 (.822) in the 4 major collegiate sports (FB, MBB, WBB, Baseball), breaking the NCAA record for a single season.


* The bear mascot actually came through a vote among the students. Some of the other options nominated were buffalo, and bookworm^(God help me). The bear won by a tad bit over half of the votes cast. Baylor has kept live American black bear mascots since the first one arrived in 1917. Each bear since 1974 has been named ""Judge"" with a nickname based on an important person in Baylor's history. The bears are trained to do a Sic 'Em (our hand gesture) and even used to [drink Dr Pepper](http://i.imgur.com/nDP9WLf.jpg), but this has since stopped. The Bears reside on campus in a habitat that is deemed a Class-C zoo, making it one of the only zoos that resides on a college campus

1350842027.0,11uoj8,thank you S.Carolina fans for helping out a guy in need last night!,xxslayerxx360,279,47,122,"last night after the UF USC game my roommate called me to pick him up because he was drunk and lost downtown but couldnt tell me where he was. he then called me again and was getting a ride with some guys he met and they were taking him to the mall by our place and asked if I could get him from there. When I got there I realized the guys who brought him were Gamecock students who drove down for the game. They were super nice and drove him in a town I'm assuming they weren't familiar with. Thank you for being good guys and helping a fellow football fan out who needed a ride. y'all are awesome

TL;DR: gamecock fans drove my drunk gator roommate to me out of pure kindness. THANK YOU!
