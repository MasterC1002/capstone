Recently, but at first I did not accept treatment, as I figured it would be, i don't know, more ""real"" to get through my problems on my own. This foolish pride was getting me nowhere, however. Now about a week before, I downloaded ""Who Are Your Friends Gonna Be"", get it.) Though politically charged for the most part, ""Last Song"" answers this query with the following sentiment. ""There's a way out but it's not on our own."" It was this line that sparked an epiphany in my head - I needed HELP. Help implies assistance from others
I listened to ""Last Song"" everyday for the rest of my stay in the unit. I was able to open up. I began to feel a connection to every other person I interacted with, therapist, psychiatrist, janitor, etc. I was, for the first time in years, genuinely content. 
Ever since then
So thank you
TL;DR - I was able to change my entire outlook on life because of an epiphany I had in a mental hospital due to a Ramshackle Glory song. Thanks Folk Punk.

I hesitate to call it truth. Yet I am forced to admit that old Mountain Goats albums FEEL true, than singing a grocery list would be (although the latter might be ""true"" in a literal sense). There is something mysterious about creative honesty that fascinates me. 

These songs were produced with those thoughts in mind. I present a more fictionalized account of my life in these songs than I have in the bulk of my previous work. In general

In reality, but I do not feel terribly burdened by that reality very much of the time. 

But when I write, always to a greater light.

They just bought a van to send two really rad bands on tour only to have it break down in Pennsylvania.  We're dying to get them home safe but Swerp Records basically spent all of the money that they had buying the van and are now broke so they can't afford to fix it and get these guys home.

**So, for only $20.  I know not all of it is really folk punk but they've got the same ethics as us, punks.  You can buy the bundle right [here!](http://music.swerprecords.com/product/get-water-house-and-my-dad-home-safe/)**

If you're from the Chicago area and Swerp managed to make enough money to bring these guys home they're playing a show in Humbolt Park at the Swerp Records venue for $5 with some other bands.  Details for that can be found [here.](http://swerprecords.com/archives/356)
