It took me well over an hour to go from game installed to actually playing. A sample of some of the issues I ran into on the way:

* Entering the product key multiple times in different forms. Whoops

* Impossible to quit the game before logging in to GFWL - have to kill the process manually.

* Password field does not accept paste. I use a password safe and long

* I ""cleverly"" thought I could work around this by pasting into the email field (which does accept paste

* Password was wrong? Thanks for waiting to tell me until after I filled out a bunch of information and making me do it all over again. Start over from the beginning.

* X-box site gives up server errors when trying to login - turns out logging into live.com to change my password completely breaks the xbox site. Start over from the beginning multiple times until I discover the problem.

* Trying to find my old X-box id was an exercise in futility. No practical mechanism for recovery as far as I can tell. Start over from the beginning multiple times before giving up.

I've probably forgotten some other issues, this may not be entirely GFWL's fault) and the Steam overlay is still broken (trying to use it just causes the game to ignore gamepad input for a while - lovely).

A little bit of back story. I never really had a lot of video games. When I was a kid my parents never bought me stuff. I'd cry and yell and nothing

I played the hell out of that game, and whenever she wanted to play against someone I was so happy to be able to play.

Well after the first month since we got it she stopped playing

Then I wanted more games. I would bother my parents about it all the time and for about 3 years all I had was SSB. The most they would do was rent me a game when they went to Block Buster but they hardly ever did that. Plus how am I supposed to beat Ocarina of Time within a week? That was the game, a fairy tale. The third year I talked to my Dad and asked him what it would take for me to get a game? He said if I did chores, washed the cars, and got good grades at school he would buy me one game per school semester.

With that contract he bought me OoT. I never beat it on the N64

About a year later one Christmas I find that Santa brings us a PS2! A year since launch but still welcome. My parents bought it  because they wanted a DVD player (we were still using VHS).

My parents didn't buy me games because they thought they were bad for me, I could go to Game Crazy, my local video game store, and buy used PS2 games. 30 Dollars a month was plenty for me, and a lot of the time I saved up.

So I bought PS2 games

I wanted to to play games. I wanted to play all these amazing titles I was seeing. My friends at school all had lots of video games

I sold my N64

Anyways, even though I had a small library. The PS2 games you will see in the picks are all the games I amassed through those years.

Skipping ahead to 13 years of age (oh, and got a copy of Halo2 from a friend that gave it to me) my dad finally said he would let me buy M rated games. Also, he had increased what he had been paying me. I was getting 15 dollars a week now.

I bought a Wii. I actually camped over night at Best buy with my Dad to get one. I also bought a 360 a few years later

Then I get my Job at subway when I'm 18

Ever since I was in 8th grade I had always wanted to play games on the PC. I would see how good they looked and how much people talked about them being so much better than console games, and L4D, oh and Far Cry. My dad didn't like using his credit card, so I had to give him money whenever I wanted to buy a game from steam, so that only happened once, to buy Far cry. I have the box cases for L4D and the Orange box in pics.

When I got my job at subway, I would savor every game I had because I had so little games. When I got my credit card and job I decided I was going to build a PC. I did. I got a monster of a PC. Then the steam curse befell upon me.

Whenever there was a sale, if they looked interesting, click, I had it. I did this for so long. I amassed a large amount of games that I had never even touched. I also kept buying games for my consoles. My brother won a PS3 from his school raffle so I would buy games to play for that as well.

Then one day I said I would stop. I'm not enjoying this. I enjoyed playing a game every week, and savoring every second. Now I had so many games I couldn't enjoy any of them. So I said I would stop and beat them all. I would not buy more games until I beat all of the games that were in my house, even my brothers games. Even games that I got from a cereal box that I never played when I was a kid. Even games that my friends had given me because they didn't like them or think they were particularly good.

It was a struggle. It was fun. It was amazing, finished them all. All of them. Every. Single. Game. In my house.

I made this post because I wanted to celebrate. But no one would want to celebrate this with me. So

I'VE BROKEN THE STEAM CURSE! I'VE BEAT ALL THE GAMES I OWN. So strangers on the Internet

Because after this I'm going to not play video games for a very long time. I'm going to wait until I feel like I can go back to gaming one game at a time like I used to before I got a job. I want to savor the games. I don't want to have a bunch of games on my steam account that have zero hours logged into them.

**TLDR**

*Because I never had games when I was little I bought a lot of games when I got a job at subway. I bought so many that I wasn't enjoying gaming like I did when I had very little games. So I decided to stop buying games until I beat all of the ones I own. Here are pics of all those games.*

Lately there's been a lot of discussion around here on the topic of posting deals on games (sales

Every time a post like this happens there are some complaints to come along with it. So I'd like to get the opinion of you all and put this issue to rest. In the past I've taken this position: 

&gt;Post any game deal you want, and SAY SOMETHING about the game. *Why* should people buy the game, did you enjoy it? etc..

So let’s get some conversation going

Should posting direct links to ""game deals"" be against the rules of this sub?

Let us know what you think.

Thank you

1373708567.0,1i7m3h,What's up with Dark Souls? [I gave up],SwordLaker,172,57,128,"Dark Souls had a $7.5 sale yesterday

6 hours into the game, about one thirds of those attempts I got killed or badly injured on the way. Every twenty attempts I got half a step farther, but in short, I'm back to zero every five minutes. The farthest I've gone to is the courtyard in Undead Parish with two swordsmen and one archer, and I haven't even managed to get back there again.

The last time I checked by the 3nd hour, and after seven years of gaming, these 4 hours of exact the same things with close to zero progress is easily the worst gaming experience I've ever had. Even Minesweeper gives variety each time I fail. I knew I had to die, I heard too much about it, but this is beyond tolerance.

That is without mentioning the irresponsive control (I play with an X360 gamepad) and the horribly optimized performance that runs  80% of the times at 15fps and the rest at 30fps

That would be fine with a random game I picked up on a sale, quite a bit betrayed, and totally dazzled. I kind of want my $7.5 and 6 hours of my life back.

I'm posting this expecting downvotes, considering what I've heard about this game.

In case anyone is interested, and I would give up if I have to do more.

Edit: structure edit

UPDATE ON MY PROGRESS: It's so embarrassing that I actually missed the ladder near the Undead Burg bonfire, and I'm heading to Firelink Shire. Everything was in just one hour. Looks like I'll be back onto the road and actually finish this. On the other hands, performance also seems quite a bit better now. Very much thanks to r/patientgamers. I hope this would help other people who picked up the game on the sale as well.

 * One will be for physical copies of games and the other will be digital like steam. 

* The survey will ask a few questions to help your santee pick a great game for you
 * If you are in the physical exchange don't bother listing consoles you own
 * We are not listing any consoles before the ps2/gamecube/xbox era
 * The survey will ask what type of game you would like to get. Please don't be too specific or your santa will be limited. For example i listed that i would enjoy a racing game. **this question is optional
 * The survey will also ask what games you already own that fit that description. There's no need to list your entire collection. Just list those that are in the genre or style you requested

The game received positive reviews from critics, but they aren't present simply for the sake of realism - they make the game much more tense and challenging:

* Fast travel is limited
* Enemy checkpoints respawn. C'mon
* You don't get rewarded for killing enemies. This encourages you to avoid combat whenever possible and focus on survival.
* Your weapons jam. This keeps you from finding one super nice gun on an enemy and using it for the rest of the game. Not a big deal if you make regular trips to the arms dealer.
* You have to take pills for malaria. I have no idea why people complain about this. You seriously just hit ""H"" when the game tells you to. Occasionally you have to smuggle travel papers for the underground to get more pills

The story is mature, and full of compelling twists. Exposition is minimal but the characters (many of whom are randomly assigned to the various roles and can be killed off at any time!) are very easy to become attached to (or loathe).

The best part of the game is definitely how little it relies on scripted events. Not only can you explore the map and tackle missions in the order of your choosing, use Molotov cocktails and flare guns to start brush fires, snipe targets from extreme distances, or equip silencers and camo to sneak past patrols, the action is just as tight as in linear games like Call of Duty. It's the game that Crysis tried to be for a few hours before giving up and going back to being Halo (and it's just as pretty). AI is also excellent - enemies will immediately flank you if you stay in one position for too long and they'll search for you where they last saw or heard you.

Basically if you like STALKER and other emergent survival games that force you to plan, manage resources, and feel like you're constantly in extreme danger, you'll love Far Cry 2.",,False,self,1363495945.0,t3_1ag53y

We all get our games long after their release when all the pre-order bonuses have come and gone... or have they?

I would say almost every time I go into a game store and ask for leftover codes I leave with at least a small handful for my console of choice.

Of course this depends on your local stores, or if they run out they're often sent new stacks well beyond the release date that rarely get picked up.

From what I've gathered (and the age of some codes I've gathered) these just sit around in drawers for an obscene amount of time until they're thrown out

Don't be specific, or maybe it's a code for a game a friend has that you can share.

1361666068.0,193v1s,Just finished Fallout: New Vegas for the first time,MurrayL,83,12,42,"I just finished New Vegas (hardcore mode) with my first character after 96 hours of gameplay! Feels like something of an event

I made sure to visit almost every location, I ended the game on the side of the NCR.

Overall I found the game to be a far better experience than Fallout 3

**Highs:**

* A really interesting storyline
* A mature tone, Fallout 3, but there are plenty of times when it doesn't shy away from a sensitive subject.
* The weapon modding system worked really well. The expensive nature of the mods made it feel very rewarding to make your favourite gun a bit better.
* A lot more variety in the environments compared to Fallout 3. Shame about the interior repetition
* Working iron sights!
* The new companion interaction wheel is a huge improvement on the Fallout 3 dialogue trees.

**Lows:**

* Stealth
I abused this copiously
* The AI is still pretty appalling.
* It crashes fairly frequently
* I found the hardcore mode to be something of a missed opportunity. It was more of an annoyance than anything else
* Almost all of the Dead Money DLC. By the end

I'm tempted to replay it as an evil character

1358874334.0,1729z2,Kindoms of Amalur: Reckoning....a good game buried under Skyrim and Schilling,ggabriele3,87,15,25,"I don't know if I'll be any good at writing a review

I just finished Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. It took about 86 hours (the main quest

My god, blacksmithing, elves, and dwarves comes out right around Skyrim...and then gets lost in the 38 Studios debacle like a neglected child caught in the middle of her parents' ugly divorce. **I won't compare the game to Skyrim or say anything more about the studio's collapse...except to say that it's a damn shame that external factors cut off this franchise's future.***

I was interested in this game when the demo came out

**Where I'm Coming From:** I'm a 32-year old gamer with limited free time. When I was younger, GTA4 (not an RPG, i know), and other big open-world games grabbed me and I was hooked. these games are my favorite genre...300+ hours into Skyrim and I'm nowhere near done. I don't care for multiplayer (never had a good experience, now i don't have the time), MMOs, and I generally complete only one play through of a game. I like being overpowered by the end of the game.

**KOA's world:** visually, and big. The different environments feel different and pretty well realized. Quests will often send you running for quite a long time through a world that can be very much like a maze, varying height and twisting/turning all over the place. After midway through the game, I was basically sick of exploring (didn't feel the need to either) and just started fast traveling. The DLC environments renewed that exploration interest, though.

**The NPCs:** Very well done here. The human and elf races are basically the same, even though I didn't feel the need to listen to all of it...they make it clear which is ""necessary for quest"" and which isn't.

**The Story:** no surprise, and so were you, until you died - and you came back Fateless. As the only one whose fate is not determined, you alone can save the world from the Threat. 

**The Enemies**: Good and bad news. The **bad news** is that there are relatively few enemy types, the AI seemed to break down a bit, where some enemies would just stand there and watch you fight while you engaged others. 
**Good News:** sometimes the AI feels smart. different enemies must be approached differently with different weapons and abilities. Enemies will be paired together in ways that complement each other's abilities, you'll get taken out by the magical enemies. If you go in to kill the magical enemies, the Tanks will block you to protect the mages. 

**The Combat:** Excellent. I put this separately from the Enemies because, but it never feels artificial.

There is a **rhythm** to the combat that I learned over time. It varies from enemy to enemy, leaving you vulnerable to attacks or stuck in enemy combos. Eventually you realize that those problems are USER ERROR. By the end of the game, *I felt almost like playing an instrument.* Though I wish the enemies themselves were more varied, and this combat definitely isn't ""simulation"", it was great gameplay.

**The Loot:** Weapon and armor drops are very common, I would go long stretches with the same weapons. However, when you do find a new unique weapon, it looks and feels unique. As for armor - there appear to be many unique armor sets in the game, but I almost never found full sets, despite a good amount of searching. I assume that more searching would have found the missing parts, but ultimately i just moved on.

**Blacksmithing / Sagecrafting / Alchemy:** I may have missed out on something here

**Greatest Crimes:** This game commits some common design crimes against the player. 

(1) making me run forever across a huge world, but there's a limit. Lots of places were BEAUTIFUL but EMPTY.

(2) **Combat Sounds Over Voice** - this is one of my biggest complaints across multiple games. Many times, there are a million Lore Stones that you can find, hit A, and it'll play some audio to add to the lore. These were always interrupted by combat (combat sounds louder than the lore audio). You can replay them, but they'd still get overridden by the next battle. 

The worst offense: an endgame conversation that's supposed to take place while you're running to the final battle. This conversation, I had a lore stone audio + the end game back-story conversation + combat audio all going on at the same time. Ugh.

**Worth Your Time?** Yes

**EDIT: Being Overpowered** - by the end of the game, no need for mana potions, no need for any of the Gems or better gear. So long as i watched my health bar, I could outlast any fight on health potions alone.",,False,self,1358886726.0,t3_1729z2

In case you don't want to read this big block of text

**Story**

Basically you are a military guy named Mason and you are in a military unit on Mars. You have some pretty cool gadgets namely the nanoforge, you aren't in the military for very long, something happens and you leave and do  odd jobs on mars. I don't remember the details of what happened, the music was louder than the voices during the cut scenes so I couldn't keep track of what was going on. This is a negative to me because the story just makes a leap in time so it was like ""ok, so he's doing this now, got it.""

On one of these jobs he gets contracted to go clear this tunnel and make a path, trying to kill all of the alien bugs and then trying to kill the main bad guy.

The game was very long, but when I did play it I would play for about 3 or 4 hours at a time. So it's not all bad, it was entertaining while I played it, it just felt like getting through the story was an eternity. 

I really liked the main character, it's pretty much my fault so I guess I'll just save the world"". There was a romantic interest in the game too, but they didn't touch very much on it; it was just assumed that he was into her, but it wasn't anything more than a friendship at that point.

**Gameplay**

The game is extremely linear, and you can carry a max of 4 weapons with you. You also have that little Nanoforge device for fixing metal structures and you can also use it to pulse launch creatures away from you or make a big hole in the buildings (think energy blast DBZ style). It has limited range, but you can upgrade that.

Scattered throughout the whole game are stations where you can upgrade your skills and change out what weapons you want. Skill points are gained by finding little glowy canisters around the areas; takes about 1000 points to really upgrade anything. I could tell the game was rushed a bit because in the first 4 hours of gameplay I managed to upgrade 4 skills, many different types with different abilities that make it challenging to kill them.

**TL;DR Final Thoughts**

Overall, otherwise pass. I'm sure there are better games out there that offer similar gameplay, I certainly wouldn't drop $60 on it.

Seriously these the most well done superhero games I've ever played. Obviously this couldn't have been a Batman game without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill playing as Batman and The Joker. Both games are really great at showing off how dark the Batman universe can be while still being the typical campy Batman we all know. They went to lengths to really make sure Batman doesn't kill anyone. When you do a ledge takedown you think he's just gonna toss them over the edge but he manages to tie them to the ledge and they just hang there. And when you knock people out, his computer is called the Batcomputer.

What I was really impressed with is your encounter with multiple of the big bad guys in the Batman universe. You're trapped in Arkham Asylum or Arkham City with just about every bad guy and his henchmen who want Batman dead. It's like the equivalent of throwing a normal person into a pit of rabid wolves. And in usual Batman fashion

If you like Batman even the slightest, it's well worth the time.

For me, around $60 here in the US, but I know it gets even crazier in other parts of the world. When you add up DLC and games that are full-priced sequels when they should be expansion packs (I'm looking at you, Assassin's Creed), it gets hella expensive to get games as soon as they come out, especially with only a part time job.

First of all, the plot is intriguing, the lines are well written, and despite what I heard before buying the game, I actually enjoyed the combat a lot (well the AI could use some work, my squad mates like shooting at walls, but that's a small problem). There are just a lot of small things that rub me the wrong way.

My main complains are:

- Subquest characters disappear once the quest is done. It makes the persistent world feel not quite so persistent.

- Dialogue choices don't really give me a clear idea on what Shepard would say. I'd want to give a slightly ""meh whatever"" response, but I was playing with the mindset of a RPG.

- My squad members don't seems to like each others, and why working together doesn't help on trust issues. This is making it difficult for me to like some of them. [Let's just say I didn't feel very bad when I picked Kaidan over her.](/spoiler)

- And speaking of Kaidan

- Elevator rides

I just played the first episode and although it seems like a decent game that I might one day finish

* from a storytelling perspective - everything is waaaay too explicit and narrated.  This is a videogame not a movie - how about letting me figure some stuff out some of the time?   If the past decade has tought us anything about videogames as a unique vehicle for narratives, I found it incredibly difficult to find myself immersed as Alan Wake.  He had such a strong personality and endless voice that I couldnt get into his shoes and imagine myself in his situation.  I couldnt *become* Alan Wake, I was merely controlling him periodically.  This sort of mistrust inthe player to find and understand obvious hints/plot devices int he game world really killed it for me, and Alan Wake is sucha  plot heavy game that it was a huge turn-off
* the combat needs work.  enemy encounters are unneccasarily prolonged and can be kind of unfair.  in a game like this the combat should only serve the purpose of advancing the narrative


here are some things that I liked:

* this game got the hair to stand up on my neck.  It certainly had its moments that made me tense and afraid.  enemies are difficult to see and come from nowhere. I found myself running through several areas of the game out of fear rather than exploring 
* although I disagree with the way that its told
* beautifully voice acted

**Bioshock**

So far I'm loving Bioshock.  Ive only put about 3 hours into it (Im in Neptunes Bounty).  The combat is fun and interesting but I do have some problems.  Mainly

**Super Metroid** 

fuck this game is hard.  This is a game that Ive wanted to play for a loooong time and Im finally getting around to it.  but its so cryptic where you're supposed to go and so many necessary rooms are hidden with no direction whatsoever.

1324453317.0,nl13v,Running a few game giveaways to celebrate our involvement in Steam's giant holiday sale and treasure hunt.,AragonLA,53,16,188,"**UPDATE**: The contest winners have been picked

**Original**: Hi r/patientgamers

What we'll be giving away

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",self,t5_2t3ad,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/nl13v/running_a_few_game_giveaways_to_celebrate_our/

It can easily be said that was and amazing experience and story.


The ending was unforgettable mostly because it was just 30 minutes if pure **glory**.
It showed all the heroes getting out of the evil baddie's hideout and gave you a voyage over the whole world that i fought for the whole 40+ hours that i invested in it.

It accompanied by an unforgettable orchestra which gave the feeling that the world is finally saved and  could have finally time to recover and start anew.


Those who didn't see it or just want some nostalgia can see it here:

That leads to my question:

Why don't more games do this kind of glorious ending orchestra stuff?

None of the mobs raise in level to match mine (would've been so much fun and challenging) but I'm using this round to listen to the English voice acting (as a Brit, The Doctor's newest companion!*) and I actually made my poor SO print out a spreadsheet for me of all the Unique Mobs so I could gleefully tick/cross them off the list once I've killed them.

I love this game. The only thing that bothers me about it is that sadly it suffered through Nintendo Wii's maximum graphics (would've loved to see Eryth Sea in HD...) and that the English subtitles were English voice acting subtitles - not Japanese translation (wish you could choose.)

There are only two major rules we would like people to follow.

One is a grading scale.  This might change in the future and is up for debate
***
5/5 - A game you would recommend to everyone regardless of a persons tastes.  You think that everyone should play this game and that most people will like it.

4/5 -A game you would recommend to most people, or to new comers of the games series/genre.  Represents the ""best"" that series/genre has to offer.

3/5 - A game you would recommend to people if they enjoy the series/genre.  Represents a good game of the series/genre.

2/5 - A game that is not recommended due to it's flaws.  Represents a title that can only be enjoyed after over looking major flaws.

1/5 - A game that is not recommended to anyone.
***
The other major rule is the title format.  The title format is pretty simple:

[System] Game - #/5  - Title of review (only if you want to add one)

for example...

[PC] Minecraft - #/5 - A fun multiplayer building game!

or 

[Multi] Skyrim - #/5 

Before posting just give the sidebar a quick read so you can read all the other smaller rules at [/r/videogamereviews](/r/videogamereviews).

Besides that, long reviews, detailed reviews, a review that breaks everything down, or whatever you feel like!

We currently don't have any reviews except the reviews I have written.  I'm really hoping that we can get the word of this subreddit out there and get more people to post!  Our goal is to have a nice community where you can look at others opinions on a game before purchasing a product as an alternative to big unreliable websites like IGN.  In about a month we will see how things are going and change

Of all the games I have so far

* Skyrim: Probably the game I have enjoyed the most. Have at least ~60 hours on that game. Skyrim looks amazing and I love how it's super easy to get into for a person who has not played RPGs before.

* Borderlands: I think it's okay. The story is rather dry at times and since I am so bad at comparing weapons I spend alot of my time doing that. Also

* CODMW: I found this game to pretty good. Fun

* MW2: I thought this game was sort of a let down. I can't really put a set category on why I didn't like it but I can't.

* TF2: This is the only multiplayer I play. I think it is fun. Not much to say.

* Portal: I loved this game almost as much as Skyrim. It is short

* BioShock: I am about halfway in this game. I like the gameplay and think it is very enjoyable. But I find the story quite frustrating as I am often turned around and told to go somewhere else because something went wrong. As a result

* Fallout 3 (I just bought this at the Summer Sale): I just started the game and am liking it. However, I find the gameplay...weird. The VATS system makes it easier to shoot but harder to kill people. Also, if you dont want to use VATS, at least in the beginning, you cant shoot with a scope. Maybe if I understood it more, I would enjoy it.

Games I havent played yet:

* Bioshock 2
* Fallout NV
* Portal 2 (very excited to play this)

Hopefully you guys can help me find some games before the sale ends.

EDIT: I have decided to get Chivalry, and the various Half Lifes (havent decided whether to do Black Mesa vs Half Life with the HD mods and such).

   I know it isn't a particularly old release but I got it on Steam for 5 bucks so just wanted to share. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is easily one of the best stealth actions of the decade. (I don't count ""killer simulators"" like AssCreed or Hitman - hiding in plain site is not quite the same as hiding in the shadows)

I really didn't want to buy it because I believed that it's just another overhyped killer-fest with a dash of stealth thrown in - but it's not. Gameplay-wise, get into air ducts, have an option to kill guards or simply knock them out, there's a close combat and the main hero even somewhat looks and sounds like Snake! Frankly, giant two-legged robots are the only thing that's missing here. And I mean it all as a good thing. Of course, the game also has plenty of other things, the main one being the fact that it's also an RPG - and again, whether the hero will be a bullet-blazing maniac who simply kills everyone in sight (not that it's going to be easy - you're getting killed after, preying on everyone with a sniper rifle, pocket secretaries

As a final word: besides a couple of boss-fights (the only issue of this game, walk through every level without taking down anyone in order to progress. I still have a couple of levels to finish it left, but it's already in my Top ten games of last decade list, if I ever make one.

Edit 2: I just finished it an hour ago and just wanted to add: do these guys rip off Metal Gear Solid on purpose? The final video and narration is basically ripped off final video sequence from any of MGS games.

Edit 3: How do you even outsorce the freaking boss fights?

The story is infinitely better, and some moments genuinely surprised me.  The characters are much more interesting as well, showing interesting transitions from the first game.  The female character is one of the best I've seen in games- Mona Sax nails the 'femme fatale' trope.

Emulator related questions:  

1. Mostly the games I want to experience are NES and N64 games
1. Do roms cost money and is running an emulator or downloading roms illegal?
1. Where can I go to find a place I can get roms that are safe/trusted?
1. If I do make it this far and actually get an emulator and a rom

Zelda related question:  

1. If I was only ever going to play one Zelda game

I can't think of any further questions at the moment; I did watch a youtube video just now on 'how to run an emulator' and it looked pretty complicated

He's aptly named because his brain is the size of a deck chair at Honey Boo Boo's house.  You throw up in your mouth a little there?  So did I.  Anyway, Cortex has help from his minions: Tiny the Tiger, who is anything but tiny, the half dingo, a half man, and the next



But this is not a perfect game.  There is no such thing as a perfect game (cue the fanboy hate from any fandom).  There's plenty wrong with it.  The bosses are a little bland (minus the N. Gin robot fight).  It's a series of dodging and waiting for an opening, you'll have to wait to do it all over again.  And, although I mentioned that there is diversity in the level design, the gameplay never really evolves from platforming, minus a few rail shooting levels.  Finally, the difficulty spikes would shame the most avid Dark Souls player.  I got my ass handed to me one level, then the next 6 I breezed right through.  It could just be from my rusted 3D platforming skill


This is one of my favorite PSX games of all times and my nostalgic side is willing to overlook some of the issues.  It can get pretty frustrating at times


Oh

There's something charming and just fun about owning a Nintendo console. It doesn't take itself as serious as Sony or Microsoft and most Nintendo IPs fun factor exceeds the graphical desires. I grew up with Nintendo and I get to see my kids grow up with Nintendo now too. 

The only drawback is the game library, the PS3 was $600 and the library looked like shit and was written as a failure back in '06.

I really hope they pull through this generation. It would be a shame the day Nintendo becomes bankrupt in the hardware industry or goes the way of Sega.

1362816241.0,19yonm,My Fable: the Lost Chapters Review.,ryano1106,38,5,15,"Well, made by Lionhead Studios and published by Microsoft in 2004

**Environment**

 -Well, but everything seemed to be copy+pasted, and the background NPCs were forgettable. The world seems huge, and that you can go anywhere, when really its all a big hallway, guiding you to the next area. I think the game would have benefited from a less linear world, not completely open world like Skyrim, or maybe to just explore.

*TD;LR: Good

**Graphics and Aesthetics**

 -I found the game world to be very good looking, and facial animation seemed to be the weakest link, but you get very used to it. Textures hold up, even up close, and hair is animated well. Flora looks good, but it is very forgettable.

*TD;LR: Very beautiful

**Music**

 -I loved the music in Fable, but had one downfall: it didn't have enough music, and I heard the same stuff every ten minutes, and everything was recycled.

*TD;LR: Recycled gold is worthless gold.*

**Voice acting**

 -The game benefited from its English voice acting, it was recycled among the background NPCs, on the other hand, the supporting characters' voice acting was top notch, especially Jack's (the games antagonist), which was very nightmarish and smoky.

*TD;LR: Background voices are forgettable

**Presentation**

 -I love the way this game presents itself

*TD;LR not necessary.*

**Story**

-Now we get down to the meat of it, but, opportunities arise for you to make gold by other means, and even more, this is how the game introduces the morality system. Once you have the money for your sister's present, you go to give it to her, while in a small garden, this can only mean the worst, you sneak out of your hiding place to find your father's body maimed, who identifies himself as Maize. He sees your plight

 -I love how this story starts out, and it really is a dedication to The Hero's Journey.

*TD;LR: Shit gets fucked up

**Gameplay**

 -Oh where to start, classic RPG stuff: Mage, Rogue, Warrior. This part game has some balance issues, as you could wear heavy armor as a Rogue and still be as sneaky, and there was no benefit from wearing Mage robes as a mage. Everything favors Warrior style, as the other class styles help your combat little. I like the magic system, decapitations are common, almost to comical levels, you get experience corresponding to those methods

*TD;LR: Unbalanced

Overall, but with some issues, it is a flawed masterpiece. If there is anything I didn't cover I will respond to comments.

* Magicka - he isn't into that.

* Torchlight 2 - this game is very easy.

* Dota 2 - he isn't into that. 

* Dead Island - NO.

* Left4Dead/2 - more fun with a full group + played it to death when we always played on the hardest difficulty.

* Payday: The Heist - he's played it to death with his co-workers.

1362666579.0,19ugbz,So far I'm hating Metroid Prime 3: Corruption - should I keep playing?  ,Thundahcaxzd,39,11,17,"Alright

here are my first impressions:  Metroid Prime 3 takes everything that was wonderful and special about Metroid Prime and shits all over it.  Metroid Prime was a serene and beautiful game where you explore the ruins of a lost society of superior beings.  The calming atmosphere provides contrast to the tense moments of battle and emotional crescendos as you infiltrate enemy bases that have been erected on the planet.  The story is told nontraditionally

Metroid Prime 3 is some fucking Michael Bay action movie with cringe-worthy dialogue and 1-dimensional, and probably more dialogue in the first half hour than there was in all of Metroid Prime.  Oh yeah, and once you get to Bryyo things get even better because you get some Navi-esque ""helper"" that will probably jabber in your ear every 5 seconds telling you what to do and making sure that you don't actually get to explore anything on your own.  And here is what might be the ultimate and most unforgivable crime of the first 2 hours of Metroid Prime 3: they put in a Meta-Ridley fight and its a *dramatic. fucking. setpiece.*  The Meta-Ridley fight from Metroid Prime 1 is one of my favorite boss battles of all time, it requires you to memorize a set of varied moves and the tells she gives before performing them, it requires you to be able to dodge all of these moves effectively, the boss is unrelentingly attacking you, her hitbox is small, probably due to the novelty of a FPS with wii controls.  However

I've pretty much given up on it because it has destroyed the main thing that made me love the first Metroid Prime - the atmosphere.  However,False,self,t5_2t3ad,False,,,t3_19ugbz

1352184521.0,12putd,"I just finished Assassin's Creed II, but I'm not sure I liked it.",impiaaa,39,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/12putd/i_just_finished_assassins_creed_ii_but_im_not/

Let me start with the things I really liked about Assassin's Creed II. First, I've seen a few awesome looking game environments (in screenshots and in-game), and this is certainly one of them. I imagine that part of that is due to the fact that Italy, the location of the game, is pretty, but the environment is really well modeled and nicely detailed, too. Also, but from what I hear, with people all over the place

Also, I felt compelled to finish them (well, all but the feathers). The game really made me feel the progress I had made so far in regards for these collectibles, for example with view points filling in pieces of the map. I used the map quite a bit, so I like the positive feedback of finding and using a view point/checkpoint.

Again, where you put money into upgrades that make your town more valuable, bringing in more income. I thought it would be a hassle, but I ended up playing the game excited for my next building upgrade. Maybe it's more positive feedback? Maybe it's a break from the action? I don't know, but I liked it.

Now

Oh boy.

Well, I never played AC (one).

The first (and last) complaint I had, the story goes something like, there's a corporation (secretly the Templars) who uses a genetics-based history-replay device, called the Animus, to try and find important stuff. The main character is Desmond, and he, in this game, to find the same important stuff before the Templars do.

Got all that? Neither did I. To me it seems like an incredibly contrived and unbelievable way of tying together a series that didn't really need it in the first place. I would be perfectly happy if the game was *just* Ezio's life (Ezio is the history-replay character Desmond plays as). Why do you need to play a game about somebody (essentially) playing a game? Just play the game! Also

My second complaint was the control scheme. I'm used to FPSs (a little), while you look from the inner-perspective of your character. This game plays similarly, but it was obviously a direct console port. It's third person, which makes sense for a game with parkour/street acrobatics, but it means restricted camera control. Not only that, but much of the camera control is automatic. Meaning, if you left the mouse alone, if the camera always knew exactly where you were going (which it doesn't). What results is a constant struggle between you and the game engine.

Another way it shows the console-port-iness is the context-sensitive and modal keys. For example, would make you jump. In fact, alone, it does nothing. To jump, you would have to use the right mouse button to *change your stance*, and *then* pressing spacebar jumps. Similarly, pressing ""hand"" (shift) will either activate, drop, all depending on where you are, and the phase of the moon.

Next

Auto-run.

*Auto-run.*

I mean, but taking control away from the player is a bad thing to do no matter what. It makes matters worse that the computer (already with its shown competence at the camera AI) gets to decide what you want to do. Argh.

The combat system kind of ties into this, and linear. Basically:

1. Attack.
2. Hold defense stance
3. If that doesn't work
4. Goto 1.

Any interesting, or trip them, or stab the guy behind you while he's not looking.

The reason this ties into the combat system is so: when I'm trying to run away from a fight

The more technical problems I had deserve a mention, but at least it's not WINE/Transgaming (doesn't look like it anyway) (also, be warned, Mac version takes total keyboard control, so no cmd-tab for you).

Anyway, but I guess I just wanted to know I wasn't alone in my criticisms.",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2t3ad,False,,
