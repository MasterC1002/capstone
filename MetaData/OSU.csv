1) We do not give out bad grades because we do not like you. We give bad grades because you earned that grade. It looks better for us to have higher grades in our courses, clear hints, and various other tools to assist you in earning a passing grade.

2) This is not 1995. We have all grown up with Word and other word processing programs. Trying to tell us that we uploaded your 15-page paper incorrectly (which you sent to us 5 minutes before the deadline) is insulting. That may work for the old bag of bones with tenure in the nice corner office

3) When you attend a review session or come to office hours (yeah

4) It is highly probable that we have taught and/or graded this course before. We have all heard hundreds of answers on irony in *Bleak House*, either formulate the best guess you can or make up something so ridiculous that we give you partial credit for making us laugh. 

5) We know you have to pass this class. We feel for you. Realtalk. If this is your third time stepping into the classroom and you just picked up the required readings for the course, perhaps you should not have spent the entire semester filming the reactions of your friends to r/spacedicks.

Hello everyone. I know you hate these emails, I kid you not, a falcon came out of nowhere and just snatched my laptop and flew away with it. So my first reaction is to yell, ""Come on man, bring my laptop back!"". Then I realized birds can't understand humans (except parakeets, which I still don't know how that's possible). Anyway, after the falcon didn't bring me back my laptop, dodging frisbees and footballs, so my biggest concern at this point was the people trying to study while this falcon is flying around making noise for no reason. If you were in the library yesterday, I couldn't find him anywhere. I look outside and he's just flying outside the library window with my laptop in his beak. The son of a bitch tricked me. He didn't even go upstairs. I'm furious at this point (as you can imagine). I run outside after him and I finally caught up to him when he got to the Olentangy River. We're out in the middle of the river fighting over my laptop when an alligator jumps out of the water and grabs it. And I'm not about to fuck with an alligator. So I just gave up and swam back to land. This leaves me with no study material for our sociology exam on Thursday.

^(So if anyone would be willing to send me their notes from the entire semester

Obviously we have no control over what happens to the streets.  However, the snow packed down, the temp rose to the mid 30s during the day, the snow got nice and wet, the temp dropped at night, eventually creating a nice sheet of ice covering basically every sidewalk in the campus area.

1. Try to Google apartment reviews for your landlord or complex. Now, consider the high probability that you will experience those first hand. People don't take time out of their day out of spite, these are real concerns that more people have probably experienced but are too lazy to type something up.

2. Check out the off-campus living survey (http://offcampus.osu.edu/posts/documents/doc-10172012-03424408-1.pdf) Thanks imnotminkus! You can see the ratings there to sort through the average landlords

3. TEST ALL APPLIANCES when being shown the apartment. If nothing works, but if they aren't available ask the person showing it how long and why it isn't functioning. Make sure you have it in writing to fix the appliance by your move in date.

4. If you can

5. Set up an appointment with Student Legal Services to look over your lease

6. Don't pick the first house you look at! They are going to rush you, and they know your anxiety is already through the roof, so they play on that. Even if you LOVE the house you've looked at, you need something to compare it to, especially if this is your first time.

7. This one applies to people with pets; make sure that if you do have a pet

Find a table with an outlet



Some sat in the union

While others said screw it

As I watched all the students


One played the piano

Soothe some of the students

Of their first exams

Which to myself was painful like a third trimester. 


I sat and I sat

As my 1500 word minimum

Just at that moment

As St. Procrastination


On Reddit! On Facebook! On your beloved twitter!

If you head north of campus, you come upon a drainage runoff.  Follow that back towards High St., and there is a really cool, graffiti covered tunnel.  I would include links and pictures, but it is much cooler to see it for yourself.  Just make sure to wear boots, bring a Flashlight (even in the day), and do not go when it is raining.  The area is named for the large metal gates that are in place to presumably block large debris like trees from flowing into the tunnel and blocking the water flow.  You can traverse the entire tunnel

Note:  If memory serves, the Gates of Hell is a really cool exploration trip for a group of friends.

This is mainly due to the fact that Gordon Gee was the one who pushed for this project to start, now that Gee isn't here, they have decided to keep Scott open for the upcoming year and fill it with students. This may mean that the project is on a temporary hold. However, the construction crew for the project will be using Halloran (or Haverfield, I don't exactly remember) for their offices, which could mean that the project is still expected to happen.

1346518666.0,z6unv,Meal plans are ridiculously priced this year. Here is my analysis:,Kerrminater,15,1,11,"*Note: I sent this in an email to OSU's director for dining services today. If you feel similarly I would recommend that you also email him about the content of this post at his email

When I heard about the new semester meal plans (blocks), and that is after doing things like buying meals for friends who live off campus, buying pizza for club events, and buying the C Store in North Commons out of applesauce to bring home to my family at the end of the quarter. I am not cheap by any means, but I would not have done these things if I did not have the extra meal swipes from my plan. I simply had to use them or lose them.

As a frugal person

Meal swipes were one thing, I felt it was adequate for a low plan. A student who didn't know better could spring for it and be left without meals for a couple weeks at the end of a quarter, which I observed in more than one case. But for me, 100 swipes was more than enough.

Blocks are a different story. There are two choices for blocks which I feel are adequate for the average student. These are the 450, except you pay $4 per block instead of $4.50. A better deal! It always pays to buy in bulk, right?

Except when regional and off campus plans are garnering the same advantages at a lower amount. The Block 160 plan gets the same 4.50 per block discount as the Block 400. I can understand some amount of preferential treatment: the commuters need a reason to buy blocks

With the Block 80 at $4.69 a block, I understand some preferential treatment. But these discounts are grossly undersized when compared to off-campus meal plans. I do not presume to be an economist, but there is a dissonance here which could be addressed. But I don't expect that, because OSU has become a business and its dining needs to be a good source of income. So I will dismiss this claim on the basis that my other requires fulfillment:

450 Blocks

I will use the same standard that the URDS used in the semester conversion

I wanted to do a comparison to see the difference between the price of the traditional meal plan for 2011 and 2012

Last year I lived in Taylor Tower. If I were still living there this year, the meal plan's average rise must have been planned to be 5.2% to match this figure.

Last year I paid $1125 per quarter for 100 swipes. This adds up to $3375 per year. An increase of 5.2%, if a swipe is equivalent to two blocks, this is quite a bit of value. We really are getting the $1.70 savings that was mentioned more than once as this plan was announced. 

But I don't need 450 blocks, which is a fair chunk of cash. Now I can put this in proportion to blocks. If I had 600 blocks, 300 per semester, I would end up with about 45 blocks. Pretty safe, right? And considering I had excess expenses before that number, there is really no way that an eater like me would go below that number. But that isn't how many blocks I am getting! I am getting 450 per semester, or 900 per year. So

So, so let's go with Block 350. If you charged $4.75 per block, which I think is pretty fair proportionately, not counting my commuter vs. campus resident talk earlier, this plan would be $3325, or $3475 with the $150 BuckID cash. I know that this option is not even as much as the price hike that inflation creates, the 5.2% I mentioned earlier, or people like me who do not eat large meals and a snack twice a day

I am impressed with the discount that blocks present, to make up for the lost money from swipes. This is something that will be very frustrating for students come December, me counted among them.

I entreat you and your department

TL;DR: Commuters are getting much fairer prices for their meal plans and dining services is making up for the better value of blocks than swipes by forcing you to buy in bulk.

EDIT: I actually made a mathematical error with my percentages. It's pretty hard to extrapolate potential increases as compared to the actual numbers of new meal plans. Anyways,,False,,t5_2qj3f,1346525195.0,,True

* It *seems* less about worry over smoke and health effects and more about overt discrimination against tobacco users.
* It *seems* like there were a number of ""compromise"" options that were pushed to the wayside.

I also worry about how they'll enforce it. I don't see many options. (Note that these are the possibilites I can see and my thoughts on each of them. There could be other options I have not yet considered.)

* OSU Police/Security will enforce the ban. This is unacceptable. Campus PD/Security exist for the sake of student safety
* A new agency/group will enforce the ban. So where does the money come from? From ticketing an already poor student population during hard economic times? Unacceptable. From funds designated for education? Unacceptable.
* No enforcement mechanism. In this case the rule would be a rule in word only. In such a case

I'm a non-smoker who used to smoke a pack a day. I enjoy avoiding the smell of smoke as much as anyone. But this feels like discrimination to me. ^(Yes

Basically I'm interested in starting/organizing a peaceful opposition to this ban. The student body can stand against the ban while still supporting courteous smoking habits like standing downwind of non-smokers and staying away from doors and heavily crowded areas. Hell

-Learn the daily deals from all the local restaurants. You'll be able to save money &amp; eat cheap any day of the week. 

-Make tons of friends when you move in your dorm. Don't be afraid to meet everyone on your floor. Some of these people can become lifelong friends.

-Decide what career you would like to eventually have and mold your academic plan around that. Plan out your courses for the entire 4 (or 5) years you will be here.

Usually in the field of linguistics you do not attend the university which you attended for your B.A/B.S. for a higher degree, I've contact the Dept. chair and she said I would totally be considered since I've branched out and studied at a school quite different than OSU.

 Basically, has anyone left OSU, pursued a degree and then returned back to OSU to pursue another? Of course I know what being a grad student is like, but I'm just afraid that by returning to OSU, it may be so different that I may end up not liking it. The program is wonderful and the only reason I'm even considering OSU again is because of that reason, as well as the opportunity I will get in getting a graduate certificate in Women, Gender

**tl;dr:** I got two B.A.s from OSU

**EDIT**: I'm not really looking for advice on grad school. I've successfully applied and have entered into a graduate program.
