""Only weirdoes go to raves alone""

""You will sweat everywhere and probably have bad B.O. if you dance all night""

""You look like a moron when you dance. What do you even do with your arms?""

""Just stay home and play Civilization III by yourself. You deserve some relaxation and nostalgia""

""You don't have a car. You'll have to take your bike and it's supposed to rain tonight.""

I had to watch the promotional video like 4 or 5 times to amp myself up enough to purchase a ticket. (The anxious part of my brain was wishing that it was sold out).

So I ride my bike out to the place and end up wandering around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes because the gps on my phone sucks and the entrance was tucked away in some corner of a building. I remember the anxiety coming back.

""You've searched enough. You tried. Just get on your bike and go home""

I did manage to find the place eventually. When I got in

""You managed to come all the way here. That's good enough. You can go home now""

I started thinking about avoidance strategies and how whenever my anxiety crept in I would always do what it said pretty much no matter what in order to avoid more anxiety. I told myself that going back out there would be good for me and finally opened up the stall door and went back.

I stood near the back and watched a few of the performances. I also noticed quite a few other people standing by themselves. Overtime

The main act came on stage and told everyone to get close so I did. We were pretty much shoulder to shoulder a few feet from the stage. I noticed that some people were dancing and really into it, but after a while I was jumping up and down and putting my hands in the air.

One cool person I noticed was a man around 50 years old. He was dancing just as hard as the 20 year olds. He really didn't care what other people thought of him

After a while I ran into this really cute girl. We were dancing next to each other for a little while and then she suggested we go somewhere more quite and talk. I went outside with her and we talked for a long time. I got her phone number

""You came to a rave all alone and now you're trying to kiss this girl who might not even be into you. You're a freaking creeper and she will know it if you try to kiss her. She's just trying to make a new friend

So we went back inside and danced some more. When the event ended I met a few of her friends and then I went outside with her. I gave her a big hug and told her goodbye. I remember when our hug ended our faces were so close. She was so pretty I wanted to kiss her so badly

I exchanged one or two more sentences with her, kissed her one more time, then we parted ways.

I remember on my bike ride home just thinking about my night. I almost let my anxiety get the better of me and wasted my night playing video games. Had I not gone out I would not have danced around, met and kissed a really great girl, and most of all overcome my fears. I know that even though I won a battle last night, the war is still raging. I will still feel anxiety in the future and I will have to overcome that anxiety. But for that bike ride home, I had no anxiety. He didn't have anything to say. I did the exact opposite of what he suggested and ended up having an amazing night. I made that little bitch eat his words.

What's my point? Some of the people you admire for being open and the life of the party will flat out refuse to face their fears. Maybe they can't swim

But you have to face your fear every day. Every day that you can and every day that you challenge it, you've struggled and we all have... but eventually you've looked your fear in the eye and did it any way.

1374515658.0,1itqez,[Major victory] Met a girl I had been talking to online for over a month and it went well!,thatoneguy5000000,117,4,24,"The beginning: I was browsing profiles online when I came across her's. I knew right away that I should contact her because we had common interests and I was actually curious to know more about her, until I realized that 'I Want it All' was now playing. ""Fuck it

The build-up: Well, the very next day she replied with a 'yes' and her phone number! I contacted her and we sent a few texts to arrange plans to meet up for coffee the next day. As happy as I was, I was also terrified that my anxiety would overwhelm me and ruin everything. I had a LOT of ""What if"" thoughts, but I kept telling myself that I can't predict the future and those things are highly unlikely to happen. When I felt a wave of anxiety approach, I would focus on my breathing and tell myself to live in the moment. Luckily I was busy the rest of the day when we made plans and that helped me keep my mind off of things. But the next day was really hard because it was the only thing on my mind. I could barely even finish a light lunch without feeling nauseous!

Meeting her: I made sure to show up early to the coffee shop and find a nice seat outside where I could relax and get used to the setting before she showed up. Luckily there was no one else sitting outside and very little foot traffic around the area. I didn't have to worry about giving a bunch of strangers front row seats to watch me fail at a first date (not that that is a likely scenario, it's not a noticeable shake,"" I thought as I leaned back in my chair. ""Just breathe."" A few minutes later, there she is! I stand up and walk toward her while we exchange pleasantries. It's a little awkward, but I'm here and this is happening. We walk inside and I order our drinks. I even managed to put the change neatly back in my wallet without my hand noticeably shaking!
Back outside we start talking about our weekends and I'm surprised at how I well I'm able to keep the conversation going. When there's a pause, I ask if she would still like to browse the art nearby. She says yes and we get up. I take our mugs back into the shop and we start walking. I have a bit of a hard time thinking of anything to say at that point, but I manage to start up something that we were talking about earlier. ""Better than awkward silence,"" I thought.

At this point we've started looking at the paintings and suddenly realize that I have absolutely nothing to say about any of this. That is, or ""a gangle, if you will."" I make jokes like these a lot and was surprised when she laughed the loudest yet! From that point we were able to keep talking about some of the other paintings and I felt a lot more at ease. 

Eventually we ran out of paintings to look at and started making our way back to the parking lot. We passed a few cars and I kept wondering when we would reach her's while we kept talking about our favorite things. Well, she asked if I had any plans for next weekend! I told her not yet, but I would definitely be interested in doing something and would be in contact. Once I reached my car, I checked the time and was surprised to find we had been talking for two and a half hours without any major awkward moments! There are only a select few people on this Earth that I can talk to for that long without saying something awkward or running out of things to talk about.

President Obama came to Fort Bliss, despite having severe anxiety issues with big crowds, I decided I was going to go no matter what.

There were some pretty tough parts. A lot of the time I was standing around awkwardly, I didn't bolt!).

By the time the president spoke, however, when I realized we'd have a chance to speak to the President and shake his hand, I was energized. There was not an ounce of anxiety in me. I was so unbelievably excited that I was leaning against a small barrier, with Secret Service agents directly in front of me, bouncing and grinning like a child. When the President got to me and my husband I looked him in the eye, shook his hand and said, Mr. President

Immediately, ""What?"" terrified I'd done something awful, and he said, ""You just look so happy."" I felt crushed, like I'd looked stupid, or foolish, (and the president saw!) but I quickly pushed that away and realized, I looked happy because I *was* happy. I was not worried, a spectacular moment.

I'm so happy, I'm just really proud of myself. I'm very hopeful that social anxiety will become less and less dominating in my life until it exists mostly as a remnant of the past.

Thank you for reading!

1370388406.0,1foopn,My SA paid off for me in a big way today.,foreveralonegirl7,80,4,7,"TL;DR I got a new job about a month ago. Two weeks in some of the temps were making fun of me for being so quiet. The temps got fired. Boss came up to me today and said that he and the higher ups have been watching me and that I was valuable to the company. I'm going to be training to use some machines next week. My pay may increase by up to 4 dollars.

I posted a while ago about how I was having a hard time getting an interview or any call backs from jobs I applied at. I went through a temp agency after posting my resume online and getting a call from them. I got hired a few weeks later after moving to a different town. They set me up on a third shift factory job. This being the first job I had in about 5 months I really appreciated finally having a job. I don't have a car so I had to walk two hours to and back from my job for the first couple days. I got pretty good at my job (assembly) and started trying to do double what was expected of me an hour (all of our numbers are recorded). 

Two weeks later two new temps were hired on to help during the night shift they were very talkative and kind of were the embodiment of scumbag steve. They tried talking to me a few times but were a little less than understanding. I finally just told them that I had SA. Surprisingly after that they left me alone BUT they still had quite a bit to gossip about with me and many other people who worked at the company. One was let go after a week for calling in too many times and the other for harassing a HR manager. 

I met (by met I mean I painfully planned out everything I was going to say to them in advance including my facial expressions - I wanted to appear to be the friendliest mofo on the planet) a few people that are permanent employees of the company and am now known as ""the shy girl"" which is much better than being confused as a conceited bitch (as the temp referred to me as). 

My supervisor and boss wanted to talk to me today at first I was really scared because I had been about five minutes late a few days prior BUT NOPE they just wanted to let me know that I was the most awesome and polite temp ever and that they wanted to take me on as a temp-to-hire. In my bosses words ""We really like having you here. You do your job and you do it well. Most of the temps we have to let go because they want a job but they want a job that they don't have to work at. I would like to start training you on the machines."" So basically my SA made it so I didn't socialize so much and made me feel 10x more motivated to do my job well because I opportunities to have a job where I can work alone don't come around often. Now I'm going to temp-to-hire once I'm hired on I can actually be a real adult :P with insurance

There are a lot of things about having SA that I absolutely hate but this is one of the times where I'm glad that I have it. ",,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1foopn/my_sa_paid_off_for_me_in_a_big_way_today/
1365535355.0,1c0boz,How I overcame my social anxiety. 3 Simple steps.,andy013,91,15,42,"[EDIT] I recommend you read my replies to the comments as well as this post since they are full of useful information and will give you some examples of how to go about challenging your beliefs. 

    .

For years I have suffered from social anxiety. I would always avoid interacting with other people and I generally had low self-esteem and felt like no one liked me. I have made dramatic progress and really feel that now I have overcame this problem and can socialize with people normally.         

    .
Over the last 5-6 years I have read probably 200 books on self-esteem and social anxiety. I have went to 3 different CBT therapists on separate occasions as well. Ultimately though it was through my own determination and hard work that I managed to overcome this problem. I feel like this is a problem that you really need to take responsibility for yourself

    .
Okay


If you feel like you will be socially rejected then you will feel anxiety. Just like if you feel unsafe up a tall tower you will probably feel fear. The difference is that a person with an irrational fear of heights thinks that even climbing a ladder that is perfectly safe will result in them falling and so they feel anxious and/or avoid climbing it. 


    .
The **first step** to overcoming your social anxiety is to **identify what rules you have for avoiding social rejection**. Everyone believes different things that is why there is no one size fits all cure for social anxiety. 

Here are some examples of what it might be (you may also have more than one rule)

* ""I MUST be good at small talk or else everyone will think I'm a loser."" 
* ""I MUST not be shy or else people will think I'm pathetic."" 
* ""I MUST not be unattractive or everyone will hate me.""
* ""I MUST be funny or else people will get bored with me."" 

The best way to discover what your rules are is to reflect on social situations and ask yourself what you were trying to avoid. What did you think would lead to others rejecting you and thinking negatively about you?


    .

The **second step** is to **challenge these rules and come up with a viable alternative way of looking at the world**. Sometimes it can be very difficult to see any alternative explanation for what you believe. You might just FEEL like your current rule is true and there is no doubt in your mind. E.g. ""I just KNOW if I am bad at small talk everyone will think I'm a pathetic worm!"". Generally there is always some element of truth to them

    .
**I am willing to help anyone who wants me to come up with some alternative ways of looking at the situation. Just post your rule in the comments or PM me and I will respond and help to challenge it.**

    .
It's important to note that it can be difficult for other people to challenge your thinking effectively because only you know the full reasoning behind it. Often you might come up with an alternative and then you'll feel your brain going, people will still like me."" if you don't believe it. You have to believe it and see it as a viable alternative explanation. 

If you post your rule and I respond and then you feel yourself saying ""yea

    .
Once you have a viable alternative way of looking at the world. It can be useful to write down your current belief and then challenge it by writing out the alternative explanation. It can also be useful to focus on specific events in your life. So for example



    .

The **third step** is to go out into the world and **test your new way of looking at things**. This means risking doing what you are afraid of. So if you are afraid of being bad at small talk, she thinks I'm a complete idiot!"", but you need to fight with it and constantly practice looking at things differently. 

    .
Often what can happen is that once you form a belief you view the world as if it is true. So if you really believe that being bad at small talk will get you rejected, so they do all these safety behaviours like going really slow and holding on very tight. But perhaps holding on tight and shaking from fear makes the ladder start to rock and then they jump off and claim ""See, I knew I was going to fall off, my fear was valid!"" when in reality it was the fear itself that was causing the problem and if they had just climbed up the ladder without all the safety behaviours then everything would have been fine. 

The same is true for social anxiety. Often your safety behaviours can result in you becoming more alienated and suppressing your own natural ability to socialize

    .

It's important to note that both the second step and the third step need to go together

I considered cancelling multiple times. I tried to stay away from my phone, I have a.... thing.""

The ride there was a bit awkward

There were about 30 people there when we arrived. My heart sank. I wanted to do my party usual and just sit in a chair in the corner and watch things and drink... But that never ends up well, and did the unthinkable: I introduced myself to someone. He was wearing a shirt of a band I like, so I talked to him a bit about it. The conversation flowed easily from there. 

Then I met the host, but after a while it wasn't even an act. People saw that I looked cool and would come over to say ""hey, who the hell are you because I haven't seen you here before."" People were offering me drinks left and right, but I turned them down, which I usually don't do. But I've found that alcohol and social anxiety, contrary to what some might think, do not mix.

I bluntly told people I didn't really know anyone there, but people appreciated the compliment and the bluntness. By the end, I wouldn't say I made any lasting friendships, but I had a couple people asking for my facebook and saying they were looking forward to seeing me at another party.

I didn't feel like myself at all. Even GOING to the party isn't something I would do. But you know what? It turned out fine, I just went ahead and did it. I figured, you know what's less intimidating than a roomful of strangers? A roomful of people, half of which you've introduced yourself to, most of whom seem pretty cool and have told you they were happy to meet you.

I work at an office job and that's fine with me - I really don't think I could do a customer service job - but I realized that I often go days without saying more than a few words to another human being. Talking to my dog is much easier...

It took forever because I spent so much time pretending to look at stuff and 'acting' while I waited for people to move away from the things I actually needed. I don't want to stand near them or ask them to move so I just walk past and bide my time.

When I come to an aisle if there's someone in the middle I usually go to the next one and go all the way around to the other side because I don't want to ask them to move and I hate squeezing past in case I hit their cart. Also when I'm leaving the aisle I'm worried that as soon as I turn the corner someone will be right there and I'll run into them.

The worst part was at the end when I was heading to the cash to pay. I saw an empty line but for a second I thought it looked like my cart wouldn't fit there (in the end it was a tight squeeze in my defence...) so I kept walking and wandered around the store for another 5 minutes until I could make another pass. There was another painfully awkward moment when I got to the cash but you get the idea.

**TL;DR - I had a big list of things to do today. BUT primarily I had a job interview today at the mall. I didn't want to go. I did. A guy approached me while walking we talked and swapped numbers. I went to the mall and filled out a job assessment questionnaire. After I was done I went to the grocery store all by myself

At a store that has a target market of self proclaimed fashionista girls aged 13-26. In this store - if I get the job I will be REQUIRED to wear 9 + pieces of clothing and accessories a day. I manged a solid 5 today. I'm fairly confident I'm not what these people are looking for. I'm not very fashionista... 

My social anxiety is really pushing hard for me not to leave the house today. I have to do it. For the moneys.

Just coming to my favorite sub reddit for my fellow SA sufferers support and suggestions. So ladies and gentleman any advice you could give me is valuable.

Even though I photographed with a potato. Nothing but [my face](http://i.imgur.com/Sw7xmY2.png) can describe my excitement right now

**UPDATE** Not sure if I got the job but some interesting things happened that I want to share. 

First off and most importantly: (all 7 of them) I got the balls gathered up to leave the house 

Second: I put on more makeup today than I have in two years. I also learned I have no idea how to apply makeup. BUT I must have done a damn good job for being so inexperienced. 

Third: While I was walking to the place my one of my worst fears manifested its self

Him ""Good morning""

Me ""G'moring""

Him ""You going to school?""

Me ""Nah.. actually a job interview""

Him ""Oh man no way! Me too! My is at ____ where is yours?""

Me ""_____ at the mall.""

Him ""Hey my name is _____ what is yours?

Me ""______""

Him ""Whats your phone number?""

Me ""________________""

Him ""Alright sweet. I'll call you and you text me how your interview goes okay ________?""

Me ""Sure. Good luck!""

Him ""You too""

and we parted ways. Plus side I didn't mess up my words. Down side - gave my number to a total stranger.

When I actually got to the mall and went in I messed up a little at first but I just gave my name and purpose and asked how they were and stuff... turned out all I had to do is sit on my ass and click on stuff on an ipod. It was a ""career assessment"" after 100 questions I just had to give it back and go. Pretty easy.

After I finished my interview I went to the grocery store..... by .... my.... self. :D and got tea. 

I am so damn proud of myself today ladies and gentlemen. This is the best day I've had socially in around 7 years.

**ANOTHER UPDATE**

So today was good. I did pretty much everything on my list of things to do.

4/30/13

List of things to do

~~Do laundry~~

Clean room up

~~Find Clothes~~

~~Make an outfit~~

~~Pierce ears ghetto style~~

~~Find jewelry to wear~~

~~Figure out which way the mall is~~

~~Memorize way to the mall~~

~~Come home and get out of ridiculously embellished outfit~~

~~Find the way to Bank and Charter~~

~~Deposit Check and 60$~~

~~Go to Charter with stuff~~

~~Pay Charter~~

Pay Random 30$ Bill

Embrace you only have 5to your name

~~Cry~~

~~Go home~~

~~Hope you get the job~~

~~Continue Applying Places~~

but after I got home from the mall I ran into some pretty intense problems. Again. and it made my day sad. Very sad. Crying was on my to do list anyway though. 

I got home from the mall and grocery store with my tea. My ""friend"" came home early from work about half an hour later. Since the Charter communication office and my bank were over three miles away I asked if he could drive me so that it would cut the time spent running me errands down. He agreed.

1st stop was the bank. I choose to go through the drive thru because... I didn't want to go inside because there were ALOT of cars in the parking lot. I got that taken care of and had plentiful moneys in my bank account. It was a pretty uneventful time. My ""friend"" just talked about how sick he felt and how he's probably going to go to a doctor soon. Good. 

2nd stop was charter communications. I had a modem I had to return and some fees I had to pay. This time I had to go into the building and talk to the lady. I went through it as best as I could. I told her I had some fees and equipment to return. I did stumble through a few words. We went through the process of bringing up my account. I returned the modem and gave her my debit card  I signed a few papers and stuff - everything went pretty much as expected. After it was all done I told her to have a good day she said ""you too"" and my ""friend"" and I left

**""Wow... again. Watching you talk to people in so painfully awkward. You're like one of those fucking characters in movies that people feel embarrassed for. You really need to work on that FOR MY SAKE. Watching you talk to people makes me feel embarrassed""**

Boom

It went on from there but that was the worst of it for me.
From that point on I just stopped talking. He's since apologized a couple times but I don't buy it. I think it was the limit for me. I know I've confided in you guys about my struggles and how proud I was of myself today. I have to tell you I really appreciate everything you've said to encourage me and make me feel awesome but damn... one thing you hear from someone can really fuck things up emotionally. I've had toxic friendships in the past but this one really is starting to mess up my (once thought nonexistent) self esteem. At that point I just wanted to go home and sit in a corner. 

I thought of you guys though. So you'll be happy to know **I didn't give up.** I asked him to take me to two other places I had applied at to check in with the managers (in person) on how my applications were coming along. 

So at the end of the day. Screw my ""friend"", stumble over my words, awkward, and weird... because I would still try my best to be nice to them.* :/ he's stuck being a ""charismatic"" horrible unemphatic person forever and you can only coast on small talk and weak jokes for so long.

1375563280.0,1jn7ns,Social Anxiety...Irrational fears of being judged. Advice anyone?,acescracked7,55,5,13,"I'm a 20 year old, and I have no desire to change.

However

Whenever l go to the mall with a friend, but I was too nervous to try anything on. And I hate when sales clerks bother and stalk me.

Most of this fear extends from the ""they're judging me"" mentality. I found that to be my issue. I'm not scared of people. I don't mind speaking with other people. Do I like to? No

The social anxiety side is the irrational fear of judgement and rejection. I'm afraid people are going to think I look stupid trying certain things on. They're going to think I'm an idiot for even trying.

Also

I never wear new clothes because I don't want people to notice the change, and a hoodie or jacket. I would never feel comfortable wearing shorts, different colored jeans, flip flops or a button up shirt or anything. I feel vulnerable and exposed when I do. 

I applied for this healthcare internship at the hospital since I want to be an RN. The interview is in a month. But they offer a free workshop that gives you more information

This workshop was today.

Well

I saw a couple people walking to the building when I was driving buy. One was a guy around my age, belt, shoes, and a nice shirt. 

People would have judged the living hell out of me. Thought I was weird. No one would have wanted to engage in conversation with me since I was the 'weird' one.

That was my logic. I know it's irrational. But I can't convince myself otherwise when I'm in the moment. 

I don't need acceptance. I don't fear rejection. I just want respect; no weird long stares or dirty looks people often give me. I'm just imagining it, classmate, the girl at the cash register, etc...I feel that they form this opinion of me that I'm a creep and just weird as hell.

I am a little different. I'm only 5' 6"". Like I said, so usually I'm expressionless. And making eye contact with an expressionless gesture is just creepy! 

I feel like I come across as 'that guy who would go somewhere and shoot up a bunch of people'. 

But I'm totally not. I'm a super 'soft' guy; I'm a really nice person if people actually gave me a chance.

On my drive home I was feeling so lost and upset knowing I have to remove myself from the applicant list for the interview since I won't be prepared for it now. I was thinking that I need to find a different career aspiration, that I could be a good nurse. I genuinely care about people and love helping others.

28th - Compliment 3 people.

29th - High-five 3 people.

30th - Ask someone if you can borrow $100 (Rejection Therapy)

5th - Compliment 6 people. 

6th - High-five 6 people.

----------//////

And that's it... for now.

Wish me luck! 

UPDATE:

June 27th - Only got to 7 people. Went to the mall and main street. This was really hard for me. 

June 28th - Complimented a really pretty girl at the mall about her boots. She said thanks and smiled. Adrenaline rush! Only got 1 person today but i'm not gonna let that get me down!

June 29th - The weather was terrible today so I couldn't do it. Just kidding

June 30th - 5 high fives!!! One person kind of made fun of me after the high five... I think that's why Im so afraid of people. I only got 2 rejections. They were pretty harsh. Me: ""High five!"" Stranger: ಠ_ಠ ""No!"" I also tried to high five a 50-something year old dad with his wife and kids. He did it. This one is pretty fun

BONUS: Last night (June 30th)

July 1st - Wore a suit

July 2nd - I know today is my break, i let him know where to go, and i told a girl that i liked her shirt. She completely ignored me and i heard a laugh. Oh well. I know a lot of guys who wouldn't have the balls to say that. Not sure why it's funny...

July 3rd - I GOT 20 PEOPLE! It was awkward because some people saw me ask multiple people for the time.. But fuck it. This time around was a little easier. I also complimented a girl on her boots and she just ignored me. Why can't a girl take a compliment?

July 4th - Tried to start a conversation with a guy that was preparing to set off fireworks. He didn't seem like he wanted to talk. I felt like I was being annoying

July 5th - Got drunk and walked down Main Street. First guy i asked for a high-five

I find socializing to be a huge drag. I actually love being in peoples' company, I have to ask them to do things, I have to start the conversations...and when I am dating, I have to flirt and make the moves. Maybe I am just attracted to equally shy people? Eitherway, this leads me to feeling apathetic about it and not wanting to bother. Furthermore, nothing really feels like it comes intuitively to me when I socialize. For example, I went on a date with a girl, no emotions telling me which way to go

I find if difficult to relate to people, but it seems people are just not extraordinary...I feel like we're all just animals filling our needs and keeping ourselves busy. Sometimes I feel like my perspective is so far off from the average person that when I walk in the streets, I feel like I am a different species from the people around me. I feel pretty alienated because of who I really am. I seem to only get by socially when I hide my depressive personality. I am happy in my own company, but I still get very lonely.

This is bothering me because I just moved to a new city, and so I have no segregated way of easily building some acquaintances and real friends.

So before any major social situation I kind of freeze up. I don't talk to anybody all day, and all in all just retreat from the world (much more than I already have). 

But what I have found that works really well is if I talk to someone else that scares me before the actual event that terrifies me. That way you warm up, it becomes just another social interaction. Going from no interaction all day, to being at a party with tons of people is like going from 0 to 100 in a second. You are gonna fuck up your engine.

For example: I had a phone interview that I was super nervous about. I didn't talk to anybody all day. I was freaking out and just waiting for the time to pass and get the whole thing over with. The actual interview went terribly. I didn't feel like myself when I was talking, and it took my mind off of the interview a little bit. I called him the next day, I explained to him what was going on, he gave me some tips and then I hung up. It was short and sweet and afterwards I was still nervous about the interview, but it had become just another social interaction for me. My heart rate was up, I got out of my head a bit and was more in the moment, I had gotten warmed up. At the interview, I had felt much better throughout the whole interaction so that is a win in my book.

As others were; I have not seen

As others saw; I could not bring

My passions from a common spring.

From the same source I have not taken

My sorrow; I could not awaken

My heart to joy at the same tone;

And all I loved

Then- in my childhood

Of a most stormy life- was drawn

From every depth of good and ill

The mystery which binds me still:

From the torrent

From the red cliff of the mountain

From the sun that round me rolled

In its autumn tint of gold

From the lightning in the sky

As it passed me flying by

From the thunder and the storm

And the cloud that took the form

(When the rest of Heaven was blue)

&gt;Shoma Morita (1874-1938) was a Japanese psychiatrist who worked with socially anxious people. He was of another time, philosophical premises underlying Morita therapy. According to Ishu Ishiyama, associate professor at The University of British Columbia, they are

&gt; - social anxiety
- social anxiety has a self-actualizing meaning
- social anxiety can be used as a motivator-facilitator

&gt;Let's examine these three points more closely. First

&gt;The second premise underlying Morita's therapy is that social anxiety has a self-actualizing meaning. In Chapter 1, social anxiety really means that we want to do well. Reframing social anxiety in this positive way can have a liberating effect.

&gt;For instance, was six years old and just learning to play baseball, he once took me aside during a break in a Little League game. With an air of concern, he said, ""Mommy, when I go up to bat, my arm starts to shake and shake."" He looked at me searchingly, I'm sure I would have slipped into the usual explanation that might have sounded like, you know, I told Jordan

&gt;When we see social anxiety as an expression of our desire to do well in a social setting, an honorable goal? This brings us to the third premise. Social anxiety can be used as a motivator, a facilitator, rather than as an inhibitor of constructive action. If social anxiety can remind us that we are simply human beings wanting to coexist with other human beings in a meaningful and successful way, it can motivate us to stay focused on constructive action. It becomes a green light, telling us to go ahead with whatever task lies ahead, whether it is talking to people, or asking someone to dance.

&gt;For many

&gt;Granted, especially if focusing on negative symptoms and thoughts has become an entrenched habit. In this case, the Morita approach may not be enough. Finding other ways of shrinking the shyness habit will be critical. The approaches described in the rest of the book will provide useful alternatives.",,False,,t5_2r22n,,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rzj1r/social_anxiety_means_you_want_to_do_well/

Cognitive behavioural therapy did help me. I think it would have been even more effective if I had stayed with the psychologist for the correct amount of time. I realise now that it helped me more than what I thought it did back then in 2010. The reason for this: mostly in life

Some of the techniques the psychologist used were; Getting me to think record and think logically about the automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) I had in a social situation. Of course most of them made not much sense. By analysing the (ANTs) when socialising I could block them out. As you do this more

Another technique was exposure to social situations. The psychologist would take me into town so I could talk to the public. He started me off with easier situations

After this I was to have conversations, I had to take a long pause after a word before continuing my sentence. By observing how menial the reactions of people I was conversing with were, I once again became less nervous. 

The repetition of these techniques and others

When socialising the anxiety would cloud my mind

Another discovery I made was, arrogance and all negativity in the world is caused by the lack of knowledge, which brings me to another point.

 It sounds like no big deal for most people, physical appearance, and relationships have all improved tremendously.  I have renewed self-confidence.  It's not perfect and I still have a long way to go, but so far I am loving the positive changes I am making.

 I met this girl a year ago and we didn't really click or anything, so we walked a few blocks and met up.  We wound up sitting at an outdoor table off of Broadway and talking and catching up.  It was a simple but terrific, terrific experience for me.  I don't envision a future with this girl and I am not crushing on her or anything like that.  But she's interesting and attractive and it does me a world of good to hang out with a member of the opposite sex.  We both had a great time and promised to get together again the next time I am in town.

1369084925.0,1epxaj,My journey of Social Anxiety,SAPenguin1,42,7,3,"I found this subreddit earlier today and decided to share my story of my Social Anxiety. Using a throwaway just because people in my life know don't know about who I used to be.

Basically for the first 23 years of my life, and I ended up with a teacher who I spoke with (pretty much had to talk to him) and he suggested doing therapy. I went to my schools counselor after realizing that I can't live like this for the rest of my life. I was on the road to living a long (or possibly short) lonely life. I went to counseling and instead of spending my time playing World of Warcraft, I spent my time trying to understand my social anxiety. 

 I eventually made the connection to myself that I was being so irrational. I was able to talk to my guild on World of Warcraft just fine, and my parents threatened to cut me off if I quit, so I basically had to keep the job. I eventually had to talk to people face to face, and I realized it was easier for me to do it as part of my job, than just my own free will. Eventually over time I realized I couldn't even remember people from 20 minutes ago, and I made that connection to my irrational fears of speaking to people. 

Now I have improved a lot and I think I am somewhat cured from my social anxiety. I still get nervous when I try new things but I always try to think of the worst that can happen, and they invite me to do things that I would have never done before, and honestly I only go just because I know I needed to break out of my SA, and I come to realize after constantly forcing myself to go out and face my fears, that its all in my head and as I get used to the interactions and being sick to my stomach, I realized its not that bad and nobody is going to remember me tomorrow, so it helped ease my mind even more.

Now I am 25 and I am much happier with my life. Given I get depressed about how much better I could have been if it weren't for my SA, and now I have a few people I would consider a real friend (not just online), and a stable job. I even go out sometimes just to do it because that feel I get when I am out in public, with people looking at me, and just realizing how far I have come. I basically faked it until I made it (Amy Cuddy Ted Talk helped me so much!).

1368278776.0,1e4kwg,Social Anxiety and Me: Passing On What I've Learned,misterala,44,7,7,"Hello. This post will be long, everyone I've told has been wonderfully supportive

So

1) I'm on the mild end of social anxiety, I don't avoid functions I feel I have to go to, and if pressured into doing scary social things I will (with mixed success), but I have an avoidant streak I'm forcing myself to counter. More on that later.

2) I'm based in the UK, so at least some of the professional help I received free of charge can be passed on to others who can't afford the help.

3) I have never been serious enough to qualify for medication, and it relaxed me a little: no idea if it was the placebo effect though!

- Discovering the condition:

I went up until the age of 25 without knowing SA existed. I assumed it was just a character quirk unique to me that I would clam up, ticking them off one by one. Both inspiring and terrifying to learn that A) I wasn't alone and B) I had a mental illness.

I sat on that information for a little while. Then I went to a hypnotherapist, and possibly helpful in the short run, but it was expensive and I didn't see a dramatic change so let it drop.

After breaking up with my girlfriend of 7 years, but the weird thing is that because my SA is triggered by certain situations, I was outgoing and chatty with the doctor, and I don't think I was believed: fobbed off with a few internet links. This time I was determined, but I didn't register high enough on their charts, so they said I could self refer to a mental health specialist. Which I did, and now I have an NHS therapist.

- The basic model

So here's the current psychological understanding of how SA works for those that don't know. It's essentially a vicious cycle that gets worse the longer its allowed to progress unchecked.

Dreading social interactions ---&gt; Nerves ---&gt; Perceived poor social performance/physical anxiety symptoms ---&gt; Negative thoughts about self ---&gt; Avoiding social interactions

That's actually a simplified diagram

But the results are the same. That goes round and round in a circle

- Recommended Reading:

My therapist began by printing off some sheets to read through from 'Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness by Gillian Butler. I was impressed enough to buy the whole thing

(Just to be clear: I'm not affiliated with the author at all

That's the psychological stuff out of the way

- Avoidance

You can always make excuses for not doing something that makes you anxious - including not getting professional help. Be super critical of every decision you make. Are you doing it because you genuinely can't, because it would have been a disaster if you hadn't avoided). In short, it's a safety behaviour that offers short term relief, but makes things worse in the long run.

- Mind Reading

I've always thought of myself as quite perceptive, and you note a 'negative expression' for a second before smiling and chatting. Is that because they don't like you, or have noticed something about you, or because you took them by surprise? Look for evidence to back up your negative view - if there's none there, your SA is taking over. You can't know what's going on in their head.

This also applies to the 'post mortem' we all do on negative experiences: just because we obsess about every little reaction and event, it won't stick with them in the long run. I don't remember the exact quote but it seems pertinent here: ""You can't compare yourselves to others, when you only see their 'best of' moments, and yourself at your best and worse"". Sure it was more catchy than that, but you get this idea.

- Observing Progress

It's in our natures to be hypercritical of ourselves - more so than we would ever be of other people. Setbacks happen, but do that all the time now, for example.

Everyone is anxious sometimes: the purpose of improving SA is to make it manageable to live with. Any improvement is a cause for celebration

Then last summer I tried to change that by joining meetup.com and some meetup groups.  Most of the ones I went to were tough because of my SA and I'd go once, board game nights, movie nights, picnics, bar hopping, etc... and by continually going out doing stuff with people I was comfortable around I found over about 6 months it really helped my SA and I started joining other groups and meeting lots of people and making more friends.  I went from having like 5-10 people I could actually call up on a weekend to do something with to having 30+; also made some really close friends when I'd been down to almost no close friends.  So yeah, in my situation it helped a lot and it sounds cheesy but it changed my life.  

Anyhow, 2013 and open it up to anyone with SA, or introversion, or shyness, or who just want to work on their social skills.

We rented out two entire hostels and it's gonna be like a giant camp getaway, and won't put you on the spot or judge you.  There will be activities like fishing, sailing, hiking, board games, treasure hunts, bar hoppings, golf on Sat/Sun and workshops and guest speakers in-between for more a direct approach on understanding and working with SA.  Dinners and Breakfasts will be provided and at lunch groups will go to town and eat.  The price on the website for the whole thing (including room &amp; meals outside lunch) is $150

I tried to do my best and be confident. When high school came around things got even tougher for me. Everyday it was like I'd go to sleep and hope I'd wake up and things would be different. Ever time I started a new school year I told myself that things would be different this time

And now I'm 21 and realizing, ""get over your fears"", ""stop worrying what others think"". We've been led to believe that this entirely our fault, as if we chose to do this to ourselves.

I don't know about you, I get hopeless and depressed.

I realized what I need to start doing is to just start being positive about every little step I take. Something as simple as saying hi to a complete stranger. Someone might say that it's no big deal and they do that everyday

You see I don't think I give myself enough credit for the stuff I do. I always say to myself, ""good for you, I know how hard that was but you were able to push past the fear and do it"".

To put it simply

Just remember you aren't weak. You are strong. Because the amount of shit we have to deal with would make any individual struggle. So give yourself a pat on the back for any small or large achievements you've made throughout your life. It's especially important to remember this on the darker days.

&gt; A surefire way to feed anxiety is by anticipating the future and imagining the disasters that may lie ahead. Looking into the future, you can end up suffering an imaginary event many times. or you can travel in the other direction and make yourself even more miserable as you look back in time and relive whatever you may have suffered in the past, and then imaginatively travel into the future to live it again and again. Anticipation of the future is what generates anxiety. If you habitually live with fearful thoughts about the future, you can be reasonably assured that your anxieties will grow and multiply. Sometimes this is called ""future tripping."" It's like Miracle-Gro for anxitey, which explains why anxiety is often paired with the word ""anticipatory,"" as in anticipatory anxiety. If you review anticipated disasters again and again, you can water this seed of anxiety into a regular nightmare.

I'm not sure where to start
countries.

I turned 17 a couple months ago and I've been struggling with anxiety since I'd guess around 8 years old. It progressively got worse to the point where, this is when I learned I suffered from social anxiety disorder. This is also the time I'd say the anxiety peaked.

After the almost 2 years of isolation, and had a sudden confidence boost. During this time, I lost a tonne of weight (almost half of it) and occasionally saw friends outside of school, something I hadn't done for a very long time. At the start of the year after I left for the second time, the school gives me another chance to come back in an actual class on one condition: I'm now a year behind all my friends (starting at year 10 again). I did go back, and I'm not sure if any of you were in this situation, but being at school a year behind all of your friends and being excluded from things that their year was doing and you weren't (excursions, and I left about 3 months ago. There are no more chances

You might think after that things only went downhill after that. Well, net cafes, etc which were things I had never done before and wouldn't have been able to without their help. But that's not all: My friends got me a job at where they worked at Dominos Pizza. What made it easy for me to get this job was the fact that I didn't need to get an interview. Unfortunately, this is where it started to go downhill.

I had my job for 4 days total before needing to be told by my friend that the boss didn't think I was right for the job. This crushed the little hope I had about my future, not even a school certificate and the fact that I have social anxiety.

So, they'll be completing school next year and probably moving onto university or something. But I'm not going anywhere.

I feel like the almost two years I spent at home is what screwed me over. I was 14-16 during that time

If you read the entire thing, so if there's anything you're wondering just ask and I'll probably answer.

Thanks again.

Here's the post:

I'm currently involved in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy program to address my severe social anxiety, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail. Finally, last year, I found an awesome CBT clinic for panic and anxiety disorders nearby, and it has COMPLETELY changed my life. I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, not incredibly easy to find). So, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading). I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, I suggest looking into CBT. Even if there isn't a clinic nearby

TL; DR: read the title

UPDATE: I just got back from the class I had to present in, my anticipatory anxiety is always horrible, but as I got into it I started to habituate and the whole thing went incredibly well. My Professor even said I set the bar really high for subsequent presentations. Thank you all for your comments and support, really. I checked this thread before my class and was incredibly comforted by all of your words. Truly. Thanks again!

 (1) I was curious if any of you have ever had the experience of really trying (I mean REALLY trying) your best to push your limits and then all your efforts got really disappointing response by friends or family?

I feel discouraged and I'm looking for any answers/advice you can offer.

Like some of you SA has really put quite a dent in my life. I work through a temp agency and do factory work because I can't really do anything else. I don't have a car because I'm afraid of having to interact with the people at the DMV to get my temps or license. I only shop at Walmart because its open late at night and I can go when no one else is there. I usually only go through drive thrus or get take out when I don't want to cook. I'm estranged from my family and most of my high school friends. I don't go to school because I'm so scared of even going through the orientation. I have two friends of questionable quality. They're pretty much my angel on one shoulder and devil on the other in the way that one is very encouraging and the other is just... I live with him and he is... very discouraging. (Don't fret about that too much I'm moving out in a month :D)

 Just recently I've been trying to go to places that make me feel horrible to make sure I don't get sucked down too deep (well...deeper) into my SA. I've made some progress but people around me aren't too impressed

(2) Have you ever been bullied by someone who knows you have SA to watch you have SA?

This guy is a jerky jerk. He's forced me to go to pick n save

Perhaps my SA probably gets in the way of me having quality friends because I think people with SA are a manipulative persons playground. Yes no?

1342638195.0,wrvmy,I'm helping myself to beat my SA. Maybe this will help you too.,SeductionNovice,33,1,31,"Hi all.

I've been suffering from SA for years. I also suffer from agoraphobia and panic disorder. But this year

I read a lot of books on CBTs and it has helped me a lot. I'm not the most social person right now but I'm getting better and better at talking to people.
This is what have worked for me so far:

* Since I suffer from agoraphobia, what I did was to take the train as much as I can. It was hard at first, but now I'm able to travel by train with almost minimal anxiety. I'm sure in a few weeks I won't have any anxiety in a train.

* Everytime I fear something (I mean a social situation), it makes me start having panic attacks (I've had hundreds of them in my life, and I'm not exagerating. If you already had one in your life, you know how scary it is). But the more I do it, the less frightening it is. For example, I was (still am but less) afraid to talk to girls (leading to a shitty love life... but that's not the point). What I did was going to the street, and try to talk to girls. At first, my voice was trembling, I was very creepy while talking to those girls, you should check out /r/seduction). To be honest

* Do little things by yourself. This one seems irrelevant but it has helped me a lot to get over my depression and self-esteem issues. Everyday, and you are capable of doing things. And that you can take action. So, if people do things for you (e.g. if your mother always cooks for you) then try to do those things by yourself. Be in control of your life. 

* Stop beating yourself mentally. Please, some others have more difficulties. But, it's not because you can't make friends (for the moment) that you're inferior. If you keep telling yourself that you're a failure, you will act as so. I think it's called a [self-fulfilling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) in psychology. You have the right to fail. But if you are still skeptical about this, try what I did. I tried to fail as hard as I can in every social situation. It was scary at first, and I was afraid of rejection but then I realized that people where less hard with me that I was with myself. Try to fail. And see what happens. 

* Try to get involved in as much social situations as possible. The more you avoid these situations, the more hard your SA will be. On the contrary, the more you stay with people, the more your anxiety will drop. Our body is not designed to stay anxious all the time. At some point, you will feel that you are relieved. If you don't believe me, try it by yourself. If a somebody invites you to a party where you don't know anybody, say yes. Go for it. Things will be fucking awkwards for sure. But do it. Just to show your body that nothing harmful will happen to you. If somebody you don't know visits your parents
Just ban the word ""no"" from your dictionary :) Always say yes to people !

* List your fears on a sheet of paper. Try to face one fear every day. Once you've faced it, I took my phone and called somebody whom I was not comfortable with. See this as a game. You win if you do it. The victory is not when you succed to have a great discussion. Even if the conversation is awkward, you win. Even if that person doesn't answer, you win. The only thing to do to win is to face your fear.

tl;dr: try to face your social fears as much as you can. It's hard, your life will be better in only a few weeks, I promise.

Bonus: You may be addicted to beating your fears. That feeling when you are no longer scared of something is just amazing. 



I hope it'll help somebody.

1368385933.0,1e73zb,A great method that worked wonders for me :),kid-vicious,36,4,13,"So I've begun to realize what most of my social anxiety stems from. I'm curious if it might be the same for you guys. It's not easy to explain

For example
*I fear that I am socially awkward
*I fear that I am ""weirder"" than most people
*I am insecure about my crooked teeth
*I am insecure that I am skinny
*I am insecure about the fact that I haven't had sex with many girls

So my social anxiety

So think to yourself what the WORST case scenario would be..

-People will notice my crooked teeth and everyone will ridicule me for it?
-The fact that I am inexperienced with girls will come to light and everyone will ridicule m for it ?
-Someone will say I'm ugly or fat and everyone will ridicule me for it

First of all

But anyway, what are the odds you ACTUALLY make a fool of yourself and everyone ridicules you and laughs at you ? How many times has this happened to you in your life ? No more than a couple times for the average person, I would say. It just doesn't happen. It's all fear. So once you have that worst case scenario in mind, remember it. Then at the end of your social interaction, reflect on how things ACTUALLY went. Then compare to your worst fear and you begin to see how irrational and ridiculous your fears were.

I tried this the other night for the first time and it worked wonders. I was invited out to a few bars with some friends that I occasionally hang out with. Anxiety immediately kicked in. That old familiar feeling. Excuses started running through my mind ""Oh, I feel like staying in.""..""I went out already this week.."" Ect.

But then I tried this method. I realized my anxiety was coming from my fear of being awkward. I feared that my supposed social ineptness would be exposed. So I then I realized the WORST case scenario would be that I show up and wait around awkwardly until they show up (if they do) and then they get there

Right then I began to laugh and say ""Wow."" What are the chances that actually happens?  So I said I would go out, saw another friend who wasn't with the group on the way there, said what's up to him as he was glad to see me, then walked into the bar to meet my friends. I walked up to them, they all smiled and gave me hugs as they were already settled and drinking. 

I realize it's a beer/wine bar only, so she buys one herself. I conversate with everyone, we play some games, and eventually they realize the place is a bit boring, so we decide to head to a local diner and grab some food. We eat a delicious meal and everyone parts ways for the night.

No embarrassment

**TL:DR**

*Write down your fears and insecurities and be honest with yourself
*Consider that your social anxiety may stem from one of those things being exposed to everyone.
*When anxiety kicks in
*Then think what the **worst** case scenario would be. You'll probably already begin to ease your nerves when you see how absurd your worst fear actually is.
*After your social interaction (party, reflect on how things ACTUALLY went and compare to your worst fear. You'll likely see how irrational and absurd your fears and anxieties are.

i don't think its really a secret that clubs are a huge trigger for my social anxiety and all the other horrible feelings and thoughts that come with it. At the club i could feel that sickness in my stomach get bad and after a few drinks my friend and i noticed a girl looking at me.

After i left the dance floor i was (i think visibly) shaking and decided i needed to leave the club asap to try to calm down. On my way home i started having all those usual self hating thoughts about leaving, i looked like an idiot, the girl wasn't even interested in me, the list goes on. 

Then something changed my thoughts, is still a step forward.

I used to have friends when I was younger, our uni recently had a carnival day where everyone gets drunk and there are a bunch of rides and stuff to do. My boyfriend was out of town, so I just stayed in my room all day and didn't do any of the activities that everyone else does. A few days later I was lending a girl from class my notes and she asked what I did that day and why I didn't call her to hang out and I told her I didn't do anything, I just slept. I told my boyfriend this and he said I shouldn't have admitted that and I should've just made up something about being drunk and having a great day. 

This girl that I lent my notes to, I know he's controlling. But anyway, after lending her my notes she said she was really thankful that I helped her out and she asked if I wanted to see a movie with her this weekend to thank me and I said okay. But my boyfriend says that she is just using me to get my notes and she probably doesn't want to be my friend because she goes weeks at a time without talking to me. But maybe it's my fault. I don't talk to her. I can't, unless she texts me first. I feel like I am supposed to text her this weekend about the movie but I can't. I don't know how to be normal anymore.

For a very long time, who I was would not be liked. That I could not hold up my end of the relationship. For so long, I have put this down to my being a bad person and have been consumed by my inability to provide anything for the people around me, who I love, but who I'm impotent to give anything back to. But I am not a bad person.

That other person is happy to let their careless remarks hurt, and the valuable quality of empathy - the kind that some more confident, but less caring individuals lack - is what remains, after you strip back all the over-analysis, self-criticism and paralysis.

I had a couple sessions with a therapist, realized I needed to be open and share painful truths so that he'd be able to help me.  It was pretty nice.  I didn't even notice the difference at first.

Then one session he ended it really ambiguously with a ""Well, should I say something, does it look rude to just get up and leave, so I blurted out ""Anything else I should know?"" and he paused and asked what I meant and I go ""I didn't know what to do so I just blurted out the first awkward thing that came to my mind.  That's what awkward nerds do.""  He kind of went ballistic and it really confused me that he made a big deal about it.

Then I realized that while I was sitting there ""in therapy"" I had no anxiety, I knew that I only want to be truthful and there was no judging.  The only possible failure I could have is if I didn't tell him the abject truth and therefore it took longer for him to figure me out and help me.  The second he said that and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do, it was like a giant gate slammed down, I had so much anxiety, drama, I had to figure out what he meant, what I should do

All of a sudden I realized all my issue came from being sure that I was going to fail in the social situation.  And it was suddenly 90% gone.  It was super easy to think ""I'm me, I don't care if they think I've failed, because if my goal is to just be me and do whatever I do, that's not failure"".  Bam, I now don't care.  I want to be around people and say whatever I'm going to say, I've met random people and just blurted out questions and gotten into conversations with them.

I haven't actually put it to much use, as opposed to that creepy fat balding guy.

I'm restricting myself to ten minutes or else I'd go on for hours.

So, and a really bleak outlook. The highlight of my week? Calling my parents on Sundays. Yea. 

I really get the sense that I've lost control of my life

I was bullied in eighth grade. Came into high-school pissed at the world and desperate to prove to myself I was worth something. I made straight A's all four years from working my ass off and pretty much studying constantly to be #1. Got into an excellent (as far as state schools go) uni with a partial scholarship. But I wasn't happy those four years. I had some ""friends"" in high-school, very stable family with understanding parents and tolerable, healthy siblings.

Now, and I see everyone else going out there and succeeding, whereas I'm having an extremely hard time adjusting, to everything. 

**Anyway

Would I want to be friends with, that no, I probably wouldn't. On the outside, I don't go out. On the outside, I don't really offer anything to people--I'm not ""useful."" On the outside, I'm not friendly. I probably don't even come across as particularly trustworthy. I'm not ""fun."" I'm not a very positive or inspiring person either. Why would someone want to be around me? 

But then I got to thinking, helpful, genuine, trustworthy, and I at least have the potential to be positive and inspiring (even though things are rough right now). I mean, my main account  has some 15,000 comment karma after less than a year on here. (That means I spend a lot of time on here

But *nothing* that I'm putting out there would lead people to believe this. How could they ever know who I am to be friends with me in the first place?

I'm 19 now. I can't tell you how often I wish I could go back to my 8 year old self, or even my last month self, and tell him not to be so worried, to enjoy the ride and speak up when appropriate--maybe even speak up when it isn't ;) . 

I only wish my 40 year old self would come and tell me to stop being so needlessly worried now

Anyway, I want to be the one you gives you that support. So PM me if you need a little pick me up.

One of the things I realized with social anxiety is it doesn't make you any less of a person. The assholes that judge you for a problem that is largely not your fault are insensitive. Unfortunately

But social anxiety is not you. Don't identify yourself with this problem. I remember reading stories about others struggling with this problem that said they overcame it. I thought to myself ""I'm different, I've gotten better over the years and I keep getting better only because I refuse to let it rule my life. It's hard to imagine a life without it, but you have to start accepting that it is a possibility. 

There will be days where you feel like you have failed. Where you haven't made any progress at all and you are still the same. It's just more negative thoughts skewing your view of reality. You just have to let it pass and remember to enjoy the good days.

Don't let this problem get further into your head. Don't think of yourself as less of a person for it. There is a tendency for us to blame ourselves for everything. But the reality is society is not understanding towards individuals with this problem.

- Once I've gotten to know somebody on the internet

- Most of my anxiety is group anxiety.

- I only met people who had similar interests

- I warm up to the opposite sex, not sure why).

I only considered Craigslist as a tool to meet people because a (pretty, and 9% were nice guys who just weren't my type. That being said, over the course of a year and a half, I have met 5 people total who I've had relationships of some sort with through this method (good relationships too!). I've gone on only one date that didn't turn into something more, which was mutual and good-natured.

If you try this

- First, Starbucks or something!), in the daytime. Be cautious! If you can, tell family/friends where you're going, who you're meeting with, and any other information you have. Even if someone seems nice online, it's not worth the risk. Meet in public, until you have gotten to know this person. (This risk isn't somehow unique to Craigslist! I would never go home with someone from a bar

- Post a picture. Even decent people want to know what you look like.

- Make it very clear what you're looking for. I always said I was not looking for sex because most CL browsers are there for that reason only and it might deter some of them. Say whether you're interested in a casual relationship

- Expect a lot emails from gross people, always stuff about sex/money. If you're really looking for a relationship, you wouldn't respond anyway. **EDIT: For clarification, you're probably going to receive photos of erect penises. I personally only received one, but it's something you should expect so you're not absolutely horrified. Gross, I know, but that appears to be how things work on the internet. :/** 

- Be detailed with your interests and be very clear what you're looking for (another bookworm? folk music fan?). Many people will ignore them. If it's obvious they have no idea what you're into even though you've already explained

- Make it clear you want to get to know someone online first and then do so. Write back and forth a lot. Be totally honest. If they're no longer interested, when you're already anxious.

- Don't give up. I'm pretty amazed with some of the people I've met, I only met 5 good guys. Not everyone out there is someone you can warm up to and you shouldn't be expected to. Find someone who is similar to you and you feel a connection with. Great people *do* go on Craigslist to meet people for genuine relationships.

I know most people think this is pathetic and I generally keep it to myself since Craigslist is associated with bad things. But if you're willing to read a lot of emails, for free, for a relationship that starts low-anxiety (online) but can build to be something more. I've always had such a tough time meeting people that this truly gave me human connection when I had no other way to find it.

Today (well technically yesterday) was my birthday and I had a bunch of people over to my apartment for a party. Eventually a lot of them left and it was just me, even though I don't have much experience on the topic but it quickly escalated into talking about sex. I'm still a virgin, I just turned 22. I've been dating a guy for 7 months now but we both have similar anxiety issues and are okay with taking it slow. Anyway I immediately felt incredibly left out. Then I felt like my 2 best friends there had become better friends with these people then they are with me, even though they've known me for years and them for only a few months. Then I thought they all probably thought I was pathetic and inexperienced, then I realized I hadn't said anything for a good 20 minutes and no one probably even noticed because no one ever notices and everyone around me always ends up being closer friends with each other then they are with me because as far as I've come I still suck at socializing in many many ways. So I lied and said I was going to sleep and they left and now I just feel sad and worried.

I know we all get these trains of thoughts and they're often not even remotely true. So how do you all turn them off? My mom has suggested finding a mantra I can repeat in my head whenever I start thinking like that. Problem is I can't think of anything. How do you all cope?

My mother has been going to a gym for the past two years and has been very satisfied with the progress she's made. She has been inviting me to go with her for a long time. This morning, but there were 5-6 people in the main gym part. The gym was an old car dealership, and the main part was just one big open room with lots of equipment. People were spaced out pretty evenly throughout the gym, and when I saw all of them I started getting nervous. My mom went to the back room and told the coach that she had brought me as a guest. While she did this, I slipped out the door and went home.

I couldn't do it. I should have known I was unable to do it, using exercise equipment. I really wish I was able to enjoy working out in a room full of people, because it's hard to motivate myself to exercise at home. If I lived on my own, I would have no problem with buying my own equipment so I would not have to worry about that, but I have many years of college ahead of me before I will reach that point.

My best friend suffers from social anxiety, and fun to bring around, but is quite worried (I assume) about what others think of him. I often invite him out to hang out with me and some friends, and he usually declines. I don't pressure him to hang out when he doesn't want to, because I don't want him to feel worse than he otherwise already does, but I do worry about him. Besides myself he doesn't have many friends, and he usually just works, and spends time with his younger sister. I want him to become more involved in social situations and get togethers because 1) I believe he wants to and 2) he seems to enjoy it so long as he isn't overwhelmed... I have a difficult time talking with him about his SA because we just don't talk about ""serious"" sort of stuff like that

As a kind of aside, just stopped giving a shit what people think about me... I remember getting quite frustrated when people would try to get me to ""come out of my shell"", so I guess I'm looking for advice or things I can try that won't make my friend feel angry or uncomfortable.

I've been increasingly obsessing over killing myself for the past week, and I do so in such a way that I minimize my proximity to other people and entirely avoid any actual interaction. The only contact I have is occasionally with my parents

I feel hopeless and there's nobody for me to go to for help. I've tried telling my parents that I can't talk to people, ""once you do it, you'll see it's not so bad!"". This makes me feel so much worse because it shows how much people don't believe it's more than me being picky and refusing to do something because I don't feel like it. I had been making some progress for a while, with a lot of help from a therapist. Unfortunately, it's difficult to see much of him and lately I've been getting much worse and more isolated. 

Now I'm at a point where I'm going to be homeless and broke, in fact one of the most hurtful betrayals of my life. A great deal of my persistant fear that nobody can be trusted stems from what he did to me. Despite that, I wanted to believe he had changed, and the thought that I could made me think I might be able to change how I feel about other people. I was wrong to trust him though. Sure, he has changed in many ways, and I'm glad for him that he was able to care more about himself, but he doesn't care any more about me than he ever did. To him, shouting violently

I have a week before I have no home, yet it happens all the time. I can't convince myself that it isn't the best choice I have. Would it be better for anyone if I waited to die alone in the street? I know people will say I'm being ridiculous. Of course those aren't my only choices. Of course I can just get over my problems. I'm just lazy of selfish for wanting to give up.

The 'big boss' works downtown, how are you' to people when they come in, as if I'm mentally challenged or something, making me almost start crying.

Generally, say ""hi"" to me, and walk on by. Downtown the check-in desk is in a weird hallway, and Idunno, with social anxiety, I can't get a good 'rhythm' of saying 'hi' to some people when they check-in. Like, they say a terse 'hi' and I look up from the computer and smile to say hi, and before I've even finished clearing it

What really upsets me is this only happens with a few people, and I can say hi and even make a little small talk with them and be 'friendly'. But these older women, I feel like they give me a 3-second window to respond to them and if I don't, they walk away and then complain that I'm 'unfriendly'.

I know I should make more of an effort to be a better receptionist, is that it just feels so unfair. I have a good relationship with many of the patrons of the fitness center, and I would say the majority of the time people are mostly satisfied with my friendliness (I'm not much for the small-talk, but I think I'm doing good at making my 'hi's and 'hi how are you's' a nice friendly, warm, welcoming tone, and stuff).

Having social anxiety in high school was bad enough

Fast-forward to today.

I stupidly responded to a distant friend's semi-controversial post having to do with the Batman shooting. She's always been easy to talk to, but have *never* fought about them.

Not this time. Within a few posts, but she said she didn't understand ""some people's"" opinions (describing mine), and how disgusting and offensive she thought they were. Many of her friends joined in, insulting my stance; they all ""liked"" each other's comments about how absurd my opinion (on the post directly below) was -- people I didn't even know. They had all joined in this little party of making fun of my position, just moments after I'd been talking with her. I was clearly online and could've answered any questions she had, but she decided to do that instead. I was shocked, but tried to keep my cool and I just didn't respond and attempted to let it go.

That didn't last. I just got angrier and more hurt throughout the day until I had a complete mental breakdown the next morning (this morning). **I flipped out beyond all rationality**. I was so angry and hurt and embarrassed. I felt singled out and betrayed by someone I thought was a friend. It reminded me of high school, without being able to join in. I had a complete panic attack, and truly, for the first time in so long, felt like I couldn't imagine continuing to live in this world. My sweet husband calmed me down.

And now I feel like such an idiot. This was such a small thing -- a mere disagreement -- and it nearly *destroyed* me. I deleted her, and my mom panicked until she could reach me. I feel like an idiot, like she's gossiping about me now, like I'm a huge stupid baby for not being able to just take something so small like that in stride. I'm so stupid with this stuff -- even when strangers on Reddit say something mean to me, I get so upset. I know I shouldn't, but I usually can't think of anything else for hours. I don't understand why even the smallest rejection or mishap amongst others sends me into a crying mess and makes me feel so utterly rejected by humanity.

I don't think this is a sustainable way to go through life. I can't protect myself from stuff like this; I won't be able to do anything if this is all it takes to send me into one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had.

And recently I've been going through ups and downs emotionally trying to deal with my issues and until pretty recently I thought I was starting to feel better. I really started having problems when I went away to college. I thought going to a new city 3 hours away from my home would be a good way to get a fresh start from high school.  Part of me knew that high school for most people is definitely a confusing time but coupled with transferring schools at the end of my sophomore year of high school and already having trouble making friends it seemed to feel a lot harder than it should. 

So, I was crying all the time. I finally saw a counselor on my campus towards the end of my second semester and I was feeling better talking about my problems. However, I ultimately felt so overwhelmed that I transferred and I haven't spoken to any therapist or psychiatrist since. I was also really embarrassed that I had left my school and was so afraid of people asking me why I left. I told everyone it was a money issue (which was partially true). But still, since transferring 4 years ago I can't say that I have really made one friend at my school. I have tried to strike up a a handful of relationships but they always ending up going nowhere because I was too afraid of rejection. I lived in the dorms for 2 years even and I didn't make any real connections. 

The one thing that is constant in my life though has been my sister and my boyfriend. Without them I don't really know what I would have but I'm at the point where I need to be able to do things on my own. I am graduating college and applying to grad programs soon. I am tired of being person every calls the ""quiet"" girl

I am at a dead end emotionally and I don't know what the next move is. I want to make new friends and lasting connections with people. I don't want to sit back and just let my life pass me by. 

I know my story isn't the worst case of social anixety ever but I'm sure everyone who reads and comments in this subreddit can relate to some of the things I have gone through.

Psychiatrist is the most important person to seek help. He knows more than any other what you feel

I learned many important things during the course of my life. The first is that you should not force social situations without being ready for it. This may complicate the picture and make you even more isolating. Recognize that you have a disease and must be treated. The longer you delay

If you have a good relationship with your family

Understand that some things in this world as having friends and relationships are not suitable for you. The sooner you accept this

Tell people the truth. If they ask you why you do not engage in relationships or have no friends

Look for occupation. Not necessarily get a job

Do not put people on pedestals. People are people and have different approach about life. Do not fall in inferiority complex and keep in mind that nobody is better than anyone

If you live alone

Being sad is one thing. Staying sad is another. Understand that you can overcome the sadness with activities or simply watch what you like on TV.

If you can work

Life is a precious thing. You can enjoy life with different things

Philosophy can help you a lot. Engage in reading philosophy books because they can show things in a different sense of life and offer insights that can help you understand that not everything you think is necessarily true. Even if you do not have mainstream opinions. Philosophers who helped me are Socrates

And most importantly: there are people in far worse situations than yours. The world is not just what's around you

This entire semester, short haired blonde girl in my social psychology class that I've wanted to talk to. She's always with a pair of similarly quiet friends, so I never felt quite comfortable just sitting next to her and striking up a conversation. Several times during the semester, I've had a chance to chat with her, but my social anxiety has always stopped me.

We were once even the last two to leave a test, not letting me engage her further before she walked away.

Anyway, futzing around on my phone for a bit. The next thing I know, adorable blonde pixie walks by me, and I want nothing more than to say, ""Hey!"" and engage her with a banal comment about the class before actually talking to her and getting her number.

Although I'm not totally confident I would've had any success talking to this girl, totally unaware of the struggle I was having. I (admittedly creepily) walked after her, wondering if she would stop at a dining hall or something where I could find an excuse to chat her up. Anyway, the conclusion of this is that no, she was off to somewhere else, it began to rain, and I was literally in a sad scene from a movie, crippled by social anxiety again.

Short summary about me:

I'm a guy, and since then I've had no friends, and no social life to speak of. I've been trying self-help CBT books for over a year, and a few months ago I attended a group therapy program for the SA. 

I've made some progress

However, spontaneous, willing to be silly, etc. I just can't make myself have these qualities. Humour is a social lubricant, right? But I just don't have what it takes to be funny or interesting. I feel like no amount of exposures can cure that problem for me. 

For example

My problem is that I simply don't have the capacity to generate even one interesting sentence

If I try speaking

Can anyone relate to this? I feel incredibly hopeless about this. Exposure can reduce the anxiety I feel

The CBT techniques don't seem to work for this. I'm not sure what to do. I've never felt close to anyone in my life. It's driving me crazy. I want to grow up and and move on

Ever since I was old enough to care about how our society and culture expects me to act, but for the most part I was silent, wishing I could be somewhere else. I was paranoid, too. I always felt like people were making fun of me, even if they never really seemed to. I was always suspicious of it if a ""popular"" kid talked to me, even if it did seem like maybe they were just trying to be nice. 

At home, or listen to what I want is when nobody else is around or awake. I hide my enjoyment of anime, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, any music that isn't 40+ years old, and anything else I feel I could be teased about. My family has always been quick to tease, and it's always deeply hurt me, even if it shouldn't. They don't mean it in meanness, and after that I kept almost all of my friendships hidden. As a result

I'm just so abnormal. 17 year old guys are supposed to like cars, but those plots are my favorite part of watching shows like The Office. For one reason or another, I have to hide almost everything about me. I've never wanted to live this way. I want to be able to be who I really am, but I can't. If I ever tried to really just be myself, I don't think anyone would like me. I'd be even more alone than I already am. I can't even tell any of this to anyone on my normal account, and if I so much as try to mention it to my best friend I lock up and can't do anything.

I think my biggest social problem is that I'm afraid to express my feelings and personality to people. Even with my friends, ""What did you do this weekend?"" is my most hated question ever.). This problem extends to my family as well as my friends. My one save is that I consider myself a fairly funny person, so when things get too personal about me I just try to spin it into a joke to keep things from getting too uncomfortable. Either way, the end result is I have trouble making conversations with people because I usually end up discarding most of the stuff that pops into my head for the reasons above. The worst thing, though, is that I've had multiple people say that I act like a ""robot"" around them. Others tell me that I ""always look sad"" or ""really bored"" when they approach me or see me around. I remember once I was talking with a couple of people and one made a crack like ""Oh, squarecake's not capable of feeling emotions."" and everyone else laughed and agreed.

1376623683.0,1kgs3t,I'm utterly terrified of people; My social anxiety is holding me back,peiweispicy,26,0,9,"First off

I'm 20 years old. I recently moved to a small town in a new state to live with my boyfriend in a tiny little village of a town. Everyone knows everyone here

I have a job at a swanky restaurant tending bar. I really enjoy my work. However, and I usually have to lie and pretend that I did something interesting (when in reality I didn't do shit), and I feel like they see through me and must think I'm fake instead of scared. 

I'm obsessed with how others perceive me. If anybody gives me any kind of positive feedback

I believe that my social anxiety stems from many problems.

One is my identity crisis. My entire life I've never known what role to play with anybody. I've read psychology books and I believe it comes from having an aggressive domineering mother, and if I wanted to sing my family would tell me how cute it was, me acting like her. Or if I got involved in sports, they'd compare me to another cousin. And etc. So by the time I became a teenager I had no idea who the fuck I was or what direction to go in. It made me feel extremely unaccepted and self-conscious. 

So now I'm convinced that no one will ever accept me, after all the years and contemplation on the matter. Still, the anxiety is unbearable, because I know that no matter what I think of myself, no one will ever think the same unless I somehow prove it. That requires aggression, and I'm withdrawn.

Another problem which has intensified my SA is a somewhat PTSD I've acquired from having toxic friends. Being terrified of most people, I use more energy on them than most people would, and they tend to become clingy or manipulative with me. I won't go into too much more detail, but the point is that now I'm always concerned that any friend I make will try to destroy me. 

Someone help me understand what I can do to change this vicious cycle. I'm tired of being the odd one out

I've gotten to the point where I am thinking about coming out to my parents (I'm completely closeted) but I don't know how it will affect my SA.
A large part of my anxiety involves worrying about how people perceive me. I like to have control over what people think of me and I'm not sure how identifying openly as gay will change that.
Part of me hopes that coming out will give me a greater sense of freedom to be myself without feeling selfconcious. But another part of me knows that identifying as gay will lead people to make further assumptions about me even though I don't exactly fit the 'gay sterotype'.

I basically grew up like this since I was in early teens like 13 I think. My parents divorced and fought often. My mom was abusive when I was growing up. It was only recently that I sought professional help and I'm now 27.

Zoloft is the medication my doctor prescribed me starting from 50 mg and then to 100, because I don't really relate to people at all. I tend to talk about the most mundane thing in the world and find amusement out of it, or talk about things that interests me - which most (normal ""socially adept"") people finds it rather ... peculiar (to say the least). Sure, I meet those guys who are similar in characteristic than I am, but we are still different. They may just be shy and manage work and school fine. Go through as though their only issue is the initial phase of things and once they are calm and comfortable, they can talk about anything. 

Though I take zoloft and I sought therapist for a while, I'm scared to seek help as well as scared to change, and even to actually change to those people who has thousands of friends; have sex with random girls every other night or something; and be able to party. Something tells me that while some of these changes some people go through sounds great but in practice, it's just not something in my character. 

I feel at work, but to me it's important. I have realized it's easier to be someone else than to be your real true self. When I revealed my true self to my sister, she didn't take things well. I've taken my time to research and do all the work but when they're unappreciated, I feel upset. But when they are presenting something that irks them, I will attempt to take the length to explain my reasoning and be as objective as possible. But many people at work takes things way too personally for me when I make no ad hominem attacks at them as they so outright do, even directly to my face. And though I am able to withstand most of what they say, it is still not easy. I can put a smile on my face as though I'm happy on the outside, and able to finally function - at least to finally be able to work on my *own* - but at times

After work, and this ranting happens. If I try to discuss somethings with some other people, say at work, I'm not always understood or heard or given the same respect I wish they give to the rest of the other employers. 

School has always been up and down with me. I at times have very strong motivation to learn what's in my interest but they quickly die down as quick as I got them. And I'm pretty much like Charlie Brown, I am very distant from the type of person they think I am - or at least I think so. I am so great at being someone else that I'm too scared to be myself. But it was this that helped me function at work. To change this - now, is like asking me to go naked in public. But I feel Zoloft has only increased the effect of my facade even more. I come home and feel like I am finally back to my sanctuary. But I also do not have anyone to talk to, either. I have absolutely no idea what I do everyday behind my computer, but I'm always here - being distant and lonely.

I'm starting a new job after having been unemployed for about 6 years and I'm in a total panic. The job was pretty much given to me by a friend of my sister. No real interview was done

Everything is happening so quickly, but for years I've been wishing for just such an offer to be thrown at me. I'm miserable right now. 

I try to think of the positives
-Worst case scenario is they fire me for doing a shitty job and learning too slow and I'm back to where I started
-I do OK and make some money
-I fuck up and everyone thinks I'm a total fucking moron. 
-I fuck up and I hurt someone.
-I fuck up and cost the company money.
-I fuck up.

I really want to work, no one likes their job. I don't think I can live like that. I already started looking for the quickest ways to retirement today and I haven't even started... I know how stupid that sounds.

There was one person in particular where I was very good friends with, but there was one person which I didn’t like at all. He knew I was insecure about myself and used this, by teasing me and putting me down. This went so far that I decided to not skateboard anymore. I just left and avoided contact with them. 

Fastforward to college. I was 18 when I started, that I couldn’t cope with the feelings and decided to quit college and do something else. 

I am not a person who likes to do nothing and dwell on their feelings. I decided to take action and do something drastic, but I never really connected with people and somehow I felt they knew and rather hang out with other people instead of me. 

This pattern started to make me very anxious, that this was just the drugs. The only time I see this group of people is when we are at a rave and do drugs, I never really get to see them in general, and when we do, we don’t really connect with each other like we do at raves. I feel I only like these people because of the drugs. 

Currently I’m doing another education. It’s the same story again: I don’t connect with people, but not hard as well so I have no problem getting grades. 
To be honest, and I’m getting tired of trying to connect and going out and do things. I don’t know what will help me feel better.

 I don't really have any close friends or friends I feel comfortable around. I've had boyfriends almost constantly for the past few years and I think it's because I feel like it's easier to be around someone who I know likes me and wants to be with me. My last boyfriend and I broke up a couple weeks ago after dating almost 6 months. I really need to focus on doing things myself and making more friends instead of always just dating someone and having basically just them.
 

 With friends/coworkers I always feel like I'm bothering them and they probably think I'm annoying and don't like me. Sometimes I don't know what to say and don't like talking about myself so I'll ask questions to keep the conversation going. I really can't help it


I'm really self conscious so that doesn't help and I'll just feel like I'm being awkward. I work with a lot of mean people at a fast pace fast food restaurant and I'll get nervous and just freeze up. I never feel comfortable so I can't think straight. One day I was hanging out with someone from work and he was asking why I'm so slow and saying how everyone makes fun of me for being so stupid. That has definitely made things much worse. 


I'm so sick of being worried of what people think of me and worrying people will think I'm bothering them if I ask to hang out. It would be so nice just to feel comfortable. I'm not terrified of being around people or social situations but if I'm invited to something like a party and I don't think anyone there will want to hang out or talk to me I won't go. I'm not the type to just force myself in with another group of people. 


I really don't know what to do. Do I see a psychiatrist? I feel like this is something that I can't just change. Everyone says to just not care like it's a choice but it doesn't work like that (for me at least). I'm starting to realize this is having a serious impact on my life.

On the outside everyone thinks I have it all, if you have all the tolls and things people want from a partner and mate, yet you still feel like nothing and act like nothing what wins out? Plus others see me and I think they believe me to be aloof, not lost.

Home life is also good, which is where I am now, halfway around the world in Sydney Australia.

I've been saying that I'm bi for a while, and I don't to this day know if i put a sense of aloofness in the air or if they are not interested.

being FA/SA sucks as many of us know, and other incidentals that people look for in a mate all there and still not being able to put them together to do what you want, makes the pain all the more, you see friends with less just doing far better.

My confidence is sky-high compared to before, and I can even start conversations with complete strangers without any feelings of anxiety. It's going to continue this way, I know it.

It's liberating, at least I never worry about it.

I'm trying to hang out with people that have an improvement mindset. As long as you realize where you are and accept that you obviously, be physically fit, spend our time around good people, develop careers that we are passionate about, etc.


I believe that there are many types of people in this world. People who have gone through SA or depression have a lot to offer. A lot of people don't see it; they tell us to just ""get over it"". But for those of us who do figure it out and get to greener pastures.. I've heard we will have a lot more compassion for the rest of society. I really believe that

I often feel as if I am my own worst enemy.  My inability to connect with others is largely due to my own quirks and the barriers I build up around myself

First, despite the fact that there isn't any way to ""make things right.""  Many times, it is something innocuous, and I can simply shrug it off, thinking that my friends probably didn't even notice.  Other times, however, it is something serious, it just happens.  On one hand

Second, and part of me feels bad for even thinking this, but I feel like they are all much closer to each other than I am, despite my (limited) efforts, which is a lot for me.  For example, a friend invited me to have Thanksgiving with her family.  I don't know why, but I don't really want to go.  I feel like she is just including me because she feels bad for me or something.  Maybe she does

My therapist has told me that in these situations I should find a person (beside myself) to act as a reality check.  Essentially, but I can't help but think that my friends will think I'm even more weird than I already am if I do such a thing.

I wrote this because I'm proud of myself for actually sticking with this and making some progress on my own. This is long

I've been lurking on reddit for years and on here for about a year but never made a post but this I feel like I have to share.
Most of my life I've struggled with SA but never really knew what it was or that I could actually overcome it. I was always told I was shy and that I always would be. Well the summer before college I found out through internet research I more than likely had SA. I was incapable of asking for help but I decided to work on it on my own.

It was hard at first I started by going to visit my grandmother who lived in a nursing home down the road from my community college. Then when classes started for the first few days they had people walking around that were there to help new students find classrooms instead of wandering around lost I asked. The I went to community college with many of the people I went to high school with so my next goal was to talk to a girl in class that I had been well acquainted with in high school

While at community college I made a lot of friends through friends. I even had a guy or two interested in me but could never follow through. I got to a point where I could function and just stopped trying to improve. I would still be quiet and awkward with people at first but I'd be fine after a while. I couldn't invite people out but I had friends that were always inviting me to do stuff. Looking at my progress over 3 years of trying objectively to many may seem like nothing but to me it was enough. 

Then last year I went away to college and moved in with my best friend and a guy we had been friends with for a while. I was happy to have my best friend with me but I now know I used her as a crutch. Why make new friends when she's here? Her and I did go out a lot and while she made friends I just clung to her.

In October her and I went to see a concert together while in the pit I accidentally elbowed a guy in the nose. I felt awful and wanted to make sure he was ok. He was fine and the two of us talked for a while after the show until he had to leave. He asked me for my number cause we had made plans to meetup at a show. A few weeks later he asked me out if my best friend hadn't talked me into not chickening out and giving the him a chance I probably wouldn't be where I am. We've been dating for 9 months now and they have been the best 9 months of my life.

My boyfriend is Mr social but he understood I didn't like new people so he was patient. He'd introduce me to one friend at a time and even though they seemed to like me I thought they were just being nice. I always thought people just hung out with me because they felt bad for me or I was that friend kept around to make fun of. Well my boyfriend kept assuring me that his friends liked me but I couldn't believe him. Until I met his best friend and his girlfriend. My boyfriend waited to make me meet him because he knew it'd be the hardest for me. Everything went great but I thought the girlfriend was kind of a bitch which my boyfriend had warned me she was. A few days later we were talking and my boyfriend informed me that the girlfriend didn't like me but his best friend told her I was awesome so she should give me another chance. The two of them ended up breaking up but while they were together she was only ever nice when the boys were around. 

I think that experience was good for me because I realized that when people don't like you they usually tell you or make it somewhat known. That chances are most people around you do like you but there are always gonna be some that don't but it won't be the end of the world because true friends will stick with you even if someone doesn't like you. My boyfriend's friends have definitely made me realize that I am likable and people do want me around. They are a bit older than I am and the have no problem informing people they don't like them. I found out recently part of the reason my boyfriend's best friend's ex hated me was because none of the guys liked her but they all thought I was at the very least ok. 

All this summer I was feeling great about everything. I had even started trying to get friends to do stuff. Granted it was my closest of friends but still it was big for me. I had more fun than I have ever had in a summer because I actually had a pretty awesome social life. 

Then it came time to start searching for a new roommate and that was hell for me. We eventually found someone who was willing to move in immediately. I was home for the summer working but my other roommate met with the new guy and said all was good. 

I decided to move back down a week prior to the start of classes so I could get acquainted to my new roommate. Of course this is the week my other roommate had to go home for some family stuff. I asked my boyfriend to come down with me and stay the week but he could only do the first night. I finally meet my new roommate is probably one of the nicest most easy to get along with people I've ever met. I was pleased just knowing he was a decent guy. He's also very outgoing and had no problem getting me to talk. 

A few months ago I decided no matter what it took I'd make friends down here. I figured I'd have to wait and meet people in classes or something which is very hard for me. I guess because in class you never know what people are like

Well we also have new neighbors this year and they had invited my new roommate to a party my first night down and he said I should go. I turned it down cause I was afraid and the next day I couldn't stop wondering what if? A few days ago when I was walking into my apartment the girl that lives next door stopped me and asked if I wanted to come to a girls of (place I live) party she was having. I told her I'd think about and it's a long story but she convinced me to come over. I was gonna leave after an hour but wound up staying for like 4 hours. I'm so glad I did because her and I have so many common interests! All the other girls were awesome and seemed to really like me. I never felt weird or out of place like I usually do.

The next night they had a party for everyone and invited me and my roommates over. I again went over and had a blast. They all seemed to really cool and like they liked me which still shocks me a little but I'm actually excited to get to know these new people. That was Friday night and I also went to hang out with just the neighbors last night again. 

School starts tomorrow and instead of being terrified like I usually am I'm actually kind of excited. I'm still nervous and worried about having to get lab partners for my science classes but I think I can handle it.

I know I still have some issues to over come but for the the first time I actually feel like it's possible that I can do it! I just feel like I'm going to have an awesome year for once!

****TL;DR: Basically thanks to awesome friends and an awesome boyfriend I finally feel like I have hope of finally beating this.

1366935336.0,1d4cim,My Social Anxiety is the Worst its Been in Years.,timeofthedreamwatch,23,2,2," I just wanted to say

 I have had SERIOUS problems with social anxiety since I was a child. I was bullied a lot, graduated just as the recession hit (mid-2008) and fell into a pit of abuse (my loved ones were enduring many hardships and were angry that I couldn't find a job) and a general lacking of most of the things that I needed. I was too anxious during this time to even talk to a clerk at a store. My older brother had a horrific accident which nearly ended his life (and changed him dramatically and permanently) that Christmas and it really affected me, so I became a vagabond, traveling from city to city, couch-surfing and working over the web part-time... Just barely getting by but never finding that place where I felt I belonged.

 Things started falling into place a few years later, seldom experienced any fear around people and I found a prominent job in my dream industry, which led to me getting my dream job at my dream company. I thought that I had finally found this magical place where I belonged and that my family would magically respect me and everything would change... I truly believed with all of my heart that I did belong and that I would from that point on never have to struggle with social anxiety again.

 I was wrong.

 I moved across the country for this job and it was the beginning of a downward spiral because I was not a good fit for the culture there... However, and every failure was infinitely painful. The culture there meant that you had to have a very specific personality or you would be criticized very heavily and I just was not that person... This, mixed with the fact that I fell in love with someone who lied to me about how he felt and then repeatedly bullied me over it made me fall apart. The company I was working for chose not to extend my contract, but deep down I was okay with it because after a year and a half of being the office weirdo I wanted out really badly but didn't have the courage to move on. I didn't want my family and friends to judge me. I was desperately lonely all of the time, so I decided to move back home, in hopes that now that I have become somewhat more successful my family would respect me. They didn't... They lied to me, saying that I could live with them

 This was the last straw. I moved to a city a couple of hours away with an old friend (the only person who knew I was suffering) and spent last winter suffering through little contract jobs, my nights spent drinking heavily while watching movies and crying. My roomie judged me harshly and constantly nagged and tried to change me which increased my anxiety even more.

 Then last month I took a permanent/full-time role doing my dream job with a different company... I moved once again for this role. I live alone now.

 I feel like I'm starting over from nothing. I am petrified of doing the wrong thing, even though I say stupid things all the time.

 I think my biggest fear is actually that I will never ft in anywhere. When I was a kid it was easy for me to have confidence because I believed that the people around me would grow up as I did and they would accept me as I am but that is getting harder and harder to believe. I'm 26, because I now hate myself and often wonder what I would have to become to get what I need from others... Even still, I get up every day and force myself to keep going, because I know that the pain of shutting myself off from the world would be far worse than making myself go to work every day and talk to people the best I can.

 In the end we all just need to know that there is no danger here, because you can hear it in your voice, and you can tell they do as well.

1366772261.0,1czgip,Hi. I'd really appreciate some opinions on all this....,warewolf95,24,4,23,"Ok

I just turned 18 last week. All my life I have been shy. School has been horrible for me.

In elementary, warewolf95 is crying!"" 

So that never helped. I was never popular in any sense of the word. I've always, MAYBE 3 REAL friends at any given time because people stayed away from me en mass, making me even shyer and more secluded.

Middle school (grade 6-8) was pure HELL for me in every sense of the word and I feel I am still directly feeling repercussions from it.

In 6th grade, and without thinking, punched them in the face and went to class.

We had horrible administrators that were pure assholes and this one singled me out on this (I know I broke the rules etc. but she really was a bitch) 

I got suspended for 2 weeks out of school in the first month of 6th grade. 

This pretty much killed any shred of a possible reputation I might've had and made me even shyer and more introverted.

7th grade went pretty good

This was the 7th level of the inferno for me. The worst year of school Ive had before or since

First off, completely uncharacteristically for me, I got suspended for cussing out an admin in the lunch room because they were busting my balls. 

Keep in mind this was in front of hundreds of kids

The last time

I was siting in class and a kid was telling people I was a cocksucker. Everyone else hated this kid too but he was the token annoying dumbshit of our class. I swear im not lying about this -

He wouldnt shut up and I couldnt get him to stop so I poked him with my DULL PENCIL THAT WASNT EVEN SHARPENED

That is extra important because lucky fucking me

Two people passed out from seeing the blood and I got another 2 week suspension. 

The other kid got two weeks as well

Ever since then - FIVE YEARS LATER - im still known as the pencil boy. ""Dont let him have a pencil!

This absolutely MURDERED any shred of popularity I mightve been building and buried it in a concrete grave at the bottom of the marianna trench.

Because of all that shit I went to counseling with a fantastic therapist. We got my anger issues sorted out and my first 3 years of highschool proceded incident-free

Somewhere in my junior year

Im a self-taught guitarist and songwriter of 7 years and music is my complete devotion and passion (to the extent you could literally compare me to a nun - im dead serious) so I forced myself to join our school's performing talents club.

Made some good friends and all was looking on the up. 

Then I developed legitimate hardcore social anxiety (I didnt realize it for another year)

I couldnt (and still cant) talk to girls without throwing up almost because of nervousness, and is also angelically beautiful, I crashed into the abyss of anxiety and spent an entire year sitting at my desk, trembling, afraid to say hello, sweating, being scared to even move just for fear of anyone judging me

Moving on

Now, is a TOTAL ladies man who is constantly eying every female flesh of meat be it live or dead, constantly has girlfriends, etc, while im 17, have never held a girl's hand or had a hug etc. am constantly having to see all this and its makin me feel really bad

So after the performance he goes and casually gives a hug to a female friend of ours and I force myself to do so also. 

Got a hug. Fuck yea

Afterwards

This female friend was aware of my shyness and was constantly laying on me and stuff the whole night trying to break me out of my shell.

Its still the most ive ever felt of a girl - her hair on my shoulder and her jumping in my lap when I sit down so I cant move

Later as things wind down Im freaking out and spazzing like a crack addict without any drugs because ive never ever experienced anything like this before - sad

This was the best night of my life to date (its ayear later now) and it was the night that made me realize I legit had social anxiety

For a few months beforehand Id been researching shyness and was reading about SA

My mom is always saying things like ""get a life!""

Ive never had a girl show any inkling of interest in me (I had honestly never even SPOKEN to a female classmate until 2 years ago and didnt have a female friend until last year)

It took me 6 months to come out to my mom about my SA - I didnt even tell her what my problem was: I just said forcefully ""mom

So I returned to my therapist from middle school and revealed to him that i thought I had SA. I got a prescription for Zoloft and have been taking it for a year this month.

My life fucking flipped. I could talk to my friends again. I could hangout without freaking. I wasnt shaking anymore

It was fantastic

I skipped out on prom (a friend was gonna go with me out of pity, and I dont wanna hang in a room full of people i dont care for, doing Idk what, having to hear shitty music all night - Ill pass, thank you)

Ive been isolating myself from my friends again - especially at lunch. I find resons to go to class early and eat in class alone because its less stressful than dealing with a casual conversation amongst friends

Idk. I feel like im relapsing or something.

Was my SA brought on by my bullying? Or did my shyness simply evolve?

So many questions.....I dont even know why im posting this

1363400646.0,1ae07w,Afraid to get a job,targaryenprinceling,27,6,3,"Hey guys. I need help... badly. Very badly. I have nowhere else to turn

I'm 25 years old and started working when I was 15. Between the ages of 15 and 21, until I couldn't take my manager's bullshit anymore, so I ragequit by going on lunch break and not coming back. I should have said the words ""I quit"" but I never did, so this got marked down as me being fired. 

The following job I began working at age 19. Right about this time was when I started getting into opiates (painkillers then heroin). I absolutely loved this job and I loved the people I worked with, and stealing so that I could at least be comfortable most of the time. When I was 21 I got caught, and fired. This was my ""bottom"" and I got help for my addiction. I've been clean from drugs ever since. But I dug myself an entirely new hole.

It was at this time that my girlfriend left me, but I thought ""a little break won't hurt me"". Two years passed and I was still unemployed. I thought enough is enough, so I dedicated myself to getting a new job and finally found someone who obviously didn't check my references.  The job was as shitty as could be and I hated it, but it was a job. I worked there for about 3 months before being fired for a reason that is unknown to me to this day. My boss never returned my calls and I couldn't contact him. 

It was exactly 2 years ago I was fired from this job. In the time since, like ""what's wrong with that kid"". I'm not capable of turning off my mind in public. Who the fuck would want to hire someone like that? They'd have to be out of their mind.

So, and he has since moved out of town. Aside from the fact that I have absolutely nothing positive to put an on application, the thought of actually getting a job scares the living shit out of me. I don't think I could handle being in a room face to face with an interviewer, answering questions about myself. I don't think there is a more awkward person on the planet than myself. Tell you about my work experience? Uhh, okay. In the past 4 years I've only worked for 3 months. School? Nope. I graduated from high school but never went to college.

My social anxiety started when I was 12. I'm pretty sure I can think of the exact incident that set it off, from now on, I'll analyze everything I say before I say it and make sure that never happens again.

At first I tried very hard to get noticed in high school. I had some success (I even broke up a fight in my freshman year) but eventually people stopped noticing me. I started thinking there was something wrong with me. I became quiet again and I was bitter about it.

When I was 16, my first (and only) serious relationship fell into my lap. To be honest, I don't know what the fuck she saw in me. I was so insecure and so worried that she would cheat on me that I pretty much forced her to give up all of her male friends. Not a day goes by I don't think about this girl. Being with her was the best experience of my life and I fucking blew it because of my own terrible self-image. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson.

Right now I'm 21 and in college. I commute. I fucking hate my college. I have no good things to say about it at all. College has been, I have good grades despite my inability to speak in class simply because I refuse to give up when I hit a wall. I pound my head against the wall over and over until I'm finally able to teach myself whatever I'm supposed to know. This process is painful, though, and it takes a toll on me. I often wish that I'd just be able to ask a question in class and get an answer without having to put myself through so much torment. I can't do it though. I need meditation and deep breathing just to be able to speak for a few moments and get my point across.

One of the main things I struggle with is that I just look so fucking weird. I'm 5'11"" and 130 lbs. I never see anyone as skinny as me. There are some days when I have no appetite, I have these really strange and noticeable wrinkles on my face that I've never seen on anyone else's face. It makes me look like a fucking alien or something. I've trained myself not to look in the mirror because of how fucking disappointing it is.

I have to give a four minute speech next week in my Public Speaking class and I don't know how I'm going to do it. I feel like I have nothing interesting to talk about and I'm terrified that I'm going to fail.

It is a vicious cycle. I have no friends because I have SA

So an acquaintance I met maybe a year ago through my cousin is the only person left where I live who I have any familiarity with said he'd be happy to hang out.

But I have no idea what two friends do together!! I don't want to go see a movie, or on a hike, or something seems a bit too...intimate (alas, I'm a straight dude). Same with going out to dinner, and doing 'lunch' or coffee seems too superficial. I just really don't know what to suggest.

for the past two to three years blushing has absolutely controlled my life. I have a naturally reddish complexion and sensitive skin
At some point in school I realised I could turn myself red by thinking about it
It is an enormous crushing weight that means everyday I live in fear, but have had virtually no interaction with girls in a sexual way or had a girlfriend because of this issue. So I'm lonely and inexperienced, which makes it all worse. 

Because I've identified it as a big problem in my life, not just after sport) my face is flushed and I'm self conscious and so on and so forth.

I would never commit suicide, but sometimes I can't get rid of the image in my head of just putting a gun in my mouth and getting rid of the pain. Again, I would never do it, but I hate how frequently I just get a massive urge to get away from everything and out of my head permanently.

I have tried various remedies over the last few years, then forget about the problem, or I have a bad time and it makes me feel like no progress is being made. So I hate myself more for that. 

The number of ways in which this has limited me are countless. SO SO many times have I not made friends or done this or that because I just can't handle the anxiety. 

Whats odd is that nothing else really worries me, and I just don't know what to do. Please help.

Both **try** to lead normal **productive** lives while experiencing **severe** panic and **crippling** fear just from being around other people. 

Wut.

What?

What!?

WHAT!?!?

I would first like to say that MTV has successfully shat on my dreams by using words that do not accurately describe what they produced. 


Second **I realize this was a dramatized production by MTV** but I feel like they REALLY misrepresented **cripplingly extreme social anxiety.**


“During this episode you will meet two young people who’s social anxiety is so severe it makes it impossible for them to lead normal lives.”

**Nonie was the only one who was marginally represented extreme social anxiety because had her mother not given that deadline she wouldn’t have bothered.**

 Nonie and Scott **at the beginning** of the show were my goals of ""normality"". The fact that we're throwing the word extreme around makes me feel like I'm just far beyond help, fidgeting,  stumbling over words, despising eye contact – yeah those are somethings that are pretty uncomfortable to have happen, but are in no way “extreme”. Exchange avoidance with refusal, having a lump in your throat with vomiting, fidgeting with shaking with so much force that you can barely stand or hold on to anything, despising eye contact with being able to feel peoples eyes on you and it making you nauseous – that’s closer to extreme.  

I was hoping to see people with severe SA (that was literally **DESTROYING** their lives) get help but I couldn't really relate (because it was people with SA that made their lives **difficult**) and its made me feel hopeless. This show has made me feel as if I’ve blasted off the extreme side of the social anxiety continuum.

Still

I know most of it will sound generic, many experiences and mistakes.

1) You need to stop blaming others or the ""world"". It doesn't matter and it won't help you improve. The only thing that matters is that it's your life that's a stake here and noone but you can change the situation.

We're not helpless victims or at least we don't have to be

2) There are no easy fixes. If you don't have any social skills then there's no magic pill or therapy that will grant them to you. There will come a day where you will have to face people and the world and you can bet it will be awkward and difficult as hell but if you really want to be happy some day you will have to face those challenges and overcome them. The sooner you accept this and prepare yourself to face this harsh reality

3) Drama is big no no for us. Yes, a problem, and any problem other than death can eventually be solved.

Contextualising your life and your situation can be a great way to kick depression away because it helps you understand that it's not as bad as it feels at times and that finding a solution is totally possible.

It also makes you more attractive to others as being a black hole of negativity and pointless drama is a sure way to keep everyone away.

4) Change what you can and eventually you'll learn to accept what you can't change.

I'm not phisically attractive, I don't think so.

That's why I've been trying to dress better, even just being average seems far from sure but at least I'm improving, I'm not just being passive and hating myself for my defects and instead I'm trying to improve what I can.

That's how my world feels sometimes. As I've grown up I've come to realize how scary and hostile the world can be. I'm all alone in an existential sense. I don't have a support group. Every relationship/friendship I've clung to in the past has eventually turned into sand

I feel that everywhere I go people are telling me that I'm wrong, but I'm thin skinned and don't take criticism well. I wish I could give no fucks and ignore what people say, but I can't. Everything is personal.

I wish I could assert myself more. If I could do that

But I can't do that because of my crushing self-confidence issues. (The inability to assert myself and my self-confidence are related and feed into each other like a vicious cycle.)

I feel like if only I were really good at something, unloveable, and not worth the space.

I recently went in for a job interview. It's a technical type job

I wish I could become a more solid person

I can relate to this, when I know that it says absolutely nothing about their personality or intelligence. I think about why I don't talk to average looking women, or even what some might consider below average. They could be very attractive in other ways. 

But as soon as I think this, I just can't force myself to lower my standards. So I hate myself for not talking to attractive women because I think I won't measure up to them, but I also hate myself for treating these women in my mind so unequally. One part of me thinks about how hard life must be for unattractive women because of this, and another still goes back to thinking that attractive women are not necessarily any better off because people automatically objectify them because of their looks.

1356653629.0,15jng2,Anxiety is actually quite a beautiful thing.,TobiTako,19,3,2,"*Disclaimer: I also suffer from social anxiety

Some of you might have read my last post saying I want to tell my parents about my problems. Some of you might even remember that I said there my father is a psychiatrist. Well I talked to him about it and got quite an interesting lecture about anxiety in general.

According to him, their technology, their locations. When fighting against a guerrilla group you know nothing. Therefore the first step is turning the anxiety into an ordered army, and gaining intelligence about it. The first step is understanding exactly what it is.

As some of you might already know

Anxiety is a mechanism that, produces adrenaline (to increase the heart rate and release certain sugars required in order to keep high energy levels for a long time from the spleen, liver and pancreas), transfers blood from less important organs and more. It's the amazing mechanism that allows a person to break 2cm metal bars or tear apart a leather band with his bare hands (true stories of patients (*)). It's the amazing mechanism that allowed holocaust survivors to jump off of running trains into the snowy forest with no food and barely any clothes and still survive. Anxiety is quite possibly the thing pushing society forward, the anxiety inducing fear of staying behind.

But if anxiety is such a wonderful thing than why does it appear so bad? Well
So what do you do with it? Well,  but that doesn't mean there's no treatment. The difference between ""treatment"" and ""cure""? When a doctor cures someone it's a one-sided process of the doctor doing his job. When dealing with anxiety disorders it's an alliance between the doctor and the patient. They both need to work for a solution, and the hard, black work, is left for the patient himself. The only way to deal with anxiety is to, well... deal with it. **Exposure** is the key word.

**Avoidance leads to more avoidance, followed by avoiding people close to him, followed by avoiding people with similar interest, etc. Avoidance is a step in the wrong direction.

What is the right thing to do? **Exposure**. Incremental moderated exposure. Taking small steps at a time
* First step is just imagining going into an elevator.
* Then going into the elevator with the doctor.
* Then just going in and instantly out
* Going in
* Going up one floor
* two floors

What are the steps? Well, your willpower, and your work. Yeah, anxiety disorders do suck quite a lot compared to other stuff, but don't give up. Nothing is set in stone. Any habit is based on something learned, anything learned can be unlearned and relearned to adapt to a different life. Don't give up. Every time you avoid think, at least imagine, facing it in your head is the first step after all.
I trust you all can do this. I'll keep posting updates here

(*) There was a story about a psychotic patient who got sedated and strapped into a bed. A heavy, resulting in great panic (which is basically anxiety).

I've always been socially anxious but I used to be a lot more daring because once I got to know people, inviting people I met to hang out, for around two years after the breakdown. There were people I'd spend a ton of time with, that I'd *call* my best friend, but I never felt connected to them. I liked them, but I didn't like spending time with them. Any of them. Different people, different circumstances, and none of them *felt* like a friend.

I've tried to explain this to my therapist but she doesn't understand.

I genuinely worry that there's just something going on in my *brain*. That I'm just not mentally capable of forging connections with people.

1345329673.0,yg3pd,I'm getting worse and I'm finding it harder to live my life...I need help...,inhellneedhelp,18,1,11,"Hi r/socialanxiety

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I think I have been suffering S.A.D since I was at least 10. I always found it hard to make new friends. I was always shy and felt nervous around people. And it didn't help that I was teased and bullied by kids and teachers in my school, and physically abused by my father. Because of these things, I was always an angry or depressed kid. I was angry because I felt that all people were cruel and selfish after being treated the way I did. And I was depressed because I wanted to know why I was so disliked, and why I was so unloved. I always figured that there was something wrong with me. I was a tall, skinny, awkward, ugly girl who was lonely. But I never knew what exactly was wrong with me for me to be so disliked. I tried being nice and friendly to people, so because of that

Today, and awkward but people won't call me ugly anymore. I can pretend to be outgoing whenever I'm in social situations, but only up to a point. I'm no longer mercilessly teased, and since I'm an adult who's moved out, my father no longer abuses me. But I still feel angry. I still have this irrational thought that all people are horrible. I dislike people, except for a select few like my boyfriend, but at the same time I can never bring myself to show it because of my conscience. I always try to be nice to others or else I'll feel horribly guilty. And what's even more conflicting for me is that I still want to be appreciated and accepted by others. I crave acceptance SO MUCH that sometimes I lose myself in the process. Sometimes, how do I do that and will people even like me if I am myself? I know this doesn't make sense

Right now, but she wouldn't even talk to me. Now she's moved out of town and transfered colleges and she let me know through text. I was crushed. So now I'm left wondering what the hell did I do for her to be that way. I thought we had great times. Sure, we had our arguments like close friends would, but we generally got along great. And now I'm dealing with this. And now I'm worried about this happening to another friend. Just yesterday I tried calling that friend to see if she wanted to hang out for once (we haven't hung out in a month) and she hasn't called or texted back. It hurts so much to know that my friends don't want to hang out with me, and I have no idea why.

Because of everything that I've said earlier, quiet, and conservative so I guess people tend to think I'm always serious and snobby. But what they don't know is that that's definitely not the case. I'm extremely goofy and friendly to the people who I'm most comfortable with. But in social situations with people I hardly know, I'm different. On the outside, I may seem normal (and I guess quietly snobby) but on the inside, I'm an emotional wreck. My heart beats so hard, I can hardly breathe properly, say

It was even hard to open up to my boyfriend because of this. I'm slowly opening up to him now, and I love and care for him too, but because of my S.A.D and my self-esteem issues, I can't seem to open up as much. After dating for two years, he knows about my S.A.D, and he's come to understand that I can't open up so much because of me, not him, and I'm making progress. But when it comes to serious issues like this

And now my anxiety is effecting me in my adulthood. I'm about to graduate from college and I currently have an internship. People say that you're supposed to network as much as possible in an internship, most people don't even know who I am because of my quietness, or they don't like me because they probably see me as unfriendly. My internship supervisor doesn't even like me. When I try speaking to her, she always seems like she doesn't want to talk to me. At first I thought it's because she's a busy woman, but I've noticed that she has no problem speaking to everyone else about things not related to work. She wants to know nothing about me and because of this, I feel that she hates me. So I feel pretty lonely at my internship, like I don't even belong. And that's almost always how it is for me in social situations.

I started seeing a therapist last week. I figured that, as well as my career. I'm even starting to turn to alcohol to calm my nerves, and that's bad. I honestly think that, unless I do something about my issues, I'm going to kill myself in a few years out of feeling like a failure in life. I don't have serious suicidal thoughts now, but it's still a possibility. I'm always afraid in my life, and I don't want to be afraid anymore.

**TL;DR** I've been having social anxiety issues since age 10. Was teased and abused. Always believed that no one liked me or cared for me. Lead me to attempt suicide at 15. Now at 22

For a long time, but that's not the reason I only have 2 friends. I enjoy going out, I enjoy being social - as long as I know the people I'm around. If I'm comfortable with the people I'm with, I can be the life of the party; funny, energetic, charming, etc. But I don't have a whole lot of people in my life that I'm that comfortable with.

A year and a half ago, I was the quiet guy. I didn't talk to anyone, really. I did after a couple months of seeing them on almost a weekly basis, but even then I was uncomfortable if I found myself one-on-one with any of them. This is indicative of every initial social experience of my life. I'm always the quiet guy.

I've mulled this over for years, I'll just be a waste of time, etc. A related thing is that I don't like inconveniencing people; I don't want to disrupt other people's lives. 99% of the time I'll wait for the other person to say 'Hi' first (even just passing a colleague in the hall) because I don't know if they want to or not.

All of this is affecting my life, anyway; I was in a LTR for almost 12 years, married for 5 years).

I have enough material to perform, but I would be a wreck if I were to try to go up on stage. I can barely fathom performing one of my guitar pieces, much less singing. Going up there is like standing on the edge of a cliff. It seems so dualistic, the crowd likes it, or they just sit there in silence and sip their drinks and coyly smile at their friends.

I just don't see the reason why, except my own potential benefits, but i'm sick of being selfish. I don't know where else to turn, but i can't stop thinking about this person and the alternative reality where we're together. I'm not really expecting any a advice, or even replies to this, it would be comforting to know...

---

**Update:** I did something i never thought possible of me, like that of a giant turtle. In a way, i feel relieved but also extremely vulnerable. I didn't expect a reply, not to mention a sensitive and understanding one. The surprise of what happened still lingers, and every once in a while my breathing escalates again. As far as i've understood, there is potential for continued contact, although i'm not sure of which kind. The initiative however, difficulty to breathe and a need to lie down and wait it out), but thanks to everyone who read and/or commented.",t5_2r22n

1358014140.0,16g1no,My 2 cents,TreMorNZ,22,6,14,"I've had an epiphany. I've just finished meditating and I believe I've finally found the way to get my head around the idea of Social Anxiety, breathing, I feel for once like I'm actually learning something.

Now firstly I should make a few points. I am writing this as my mind understands it, one which I hope others can learn from. The second point is that I'm writing this on my ipad, and the first iteration of this text was lost as safari decided it would suddenly close after about an hour of typing. I say this purely because damn I'm angry, I poured my heart out and it was all lost...seriously, fuck Apple. Lastly, I appreciate this is a long story, but if I told myself to hold back in any way it would defeat the purpose. Please read it to the end.
Moving on...

I think meditation is the most important technique in fighting SA. Let me explain why.
SA is, when it's successful, to reach a point of clarity in which to base my fight from. I recently read an article where they said it allows us to see the present. A good example would be a huge, completely flat and empty desert. The sun never moves in the sky, and there is no way to gauge where we are or which direction we are traveling. This is Social Anxiety. We can pick a direction, but how do we know how far we've travelled, or if we're running in circles? In this metaphor, one place that belongs to us
For this reason

To fully understand my story, when SA first began for me.
I was a very intelligent child, and the fears of social failure had never crossed my mind. Man, I so wish I could be like that again, the benefits of social acceptance can't hold a flame to absolute interest in everything.
This was a wonderful time, but I was happily oblivious to this. 
Eventually, It was simply remarks from parent or teachers, about how I should have more friends, nothing cruel, simply observations which I ignored. Then my schoolmates began to remark, and after a length of time the feeling that something wasn't right crept in. To be honest, this was still not a problem for me
The real problem only began around the age when being ""cool"" becomes important, I started to see myself as abnormal. Obviously I wanted to fit in, to stop people saying these things, so I tried to use my mind to work out what they expected of me. My mind, however, was ill equipped to understand the fine points of intermediate school interaction, I mean why should I care who kissed who when there's a whole universe to observe? So I started to believe there was something inherently faulty with me, whose life up till then had been filled with success and praise

I would like to point out that I was blessed to have traveled quite a lot with my family as a child. At 9 years old I was chatting to 30 year olds about their experiences, all without the slightest hint of fear. Crazy, to think all it took was a bunch of children to teach me fear.

Heres where I made the first mistake. During interactions at school, except for simple, quick, and cutting thoughts such as ""run, run left, watch out for that tree"". It makes a lot of sense, because when a bear is chasing you the last thing your mind wants you to do is think ""hey, and it's just not designed for that. I also think this is the mistake that everyone who suffers from SA has made. So instead of waiting till we can think normally, basically every thought we experience
This is why it's so hard to rid ourselves of anxiety, but they are all delivered in the way meant to force our bodies to run from danger. Another thing to note is that when thinking like this, each thought is a bit delayed, I'm guessing because more priority is put on your senses analyzing the environment for escape routes, and on making a decision and afterward analyzing its effectiveness. I spent so long wondering why I was so slow at reaching the same conclusions as others, and now it's clear. I would make a decision, then rethink it, on and on till I come to the conclusion at I'm just too stupid.

When I meditate, insanely clever and efficient. I believe ""normal"" people are simply closer to this than we are, and those buddhist monks even closer than them. I don't think I will achieve this absolute state during the day, we all need some part of those old instincts to guide us through a normal days trials, but if i focus on it as a guide, I believe I can beat SA.

In finishing, I apologise for this. As I said, this was the 2nd copy, and I realise I lost some of the train-of-thought brilliance from the first copy. Many will probably not understand this, and that goes hand in hand with our affliction.
However

Start meditating. 

Just do it. Don't make excuses. I know it's hard to believe me when there are a million different ""proven"" techniques to beat SA, but if its not working, you're doing it wrong.
A few points to remember:
* The idea is complete lack of thinking, and even harder to accomplish, but when you keep telling yourself what to do in your head, those thoughts are automatically the sharp orders that we are fighting against.
*Just let it happen. This ties in to the whole idea of meditation, but once we reach the point where we understand that ALL thoughts are part of us,and should not be fought, be they good or bad, then you'll know what I'm talking about. When it first happened to me, it was like a brief taste of what we all aim for, just complete comfort.

P.S. I consider myself a pretty intelligent person (under the layer of anxiety), and even then I don't think I'm talented enough to accurately explain it all. Therefore, if anyone feels like they could gain something from it, please message me and we can organise a Skype session.",,False,,False,t3_16g1no

And the way I see it the negative feelings are stemming from somewhere in my subconscious, negative thoughts and emotions don't just pop out of thin air.

I took some suggestions and it's been up and down.  Went out and did some photography with a group of people and even though I was very awkward

Then it happened.  I shared with my wife that I was feeling ready to take over the world again.  An hour later our family outing went south and I broke.  I can't communicate what the problem is because I don't understand it truly myself.  Lack of support

Since then I've been hyper-self-conscious.  I had family over for dinner tonight and although things seemed to go well I've spent the last few hours wondering if they thought I was just a big wierdo.  I was totally tense before they arrived, now I'm just driving myself crazy.

Over the next 6 years, but I rejected them because I was so shy and didn't really know what to say.

So basically
Halfway through the first year, he was like a godsend.
We ended up going on a few dates, and after a while I started feeling so stressed out at the prospect of having to spend time with him, even though he was lovely, charismatic, and we had similar interests.
Eventually he gave up

1372688641.0,1hfdlu,Things finally seem to be getting better for me!,EverAndy,20,4,3,"As I've previously explained

I started telling myself to stop being so socially awkward and when on my own I would tell myself that I can beat this thing on my own. But as some of you should already know

I'm too afraid to see a doctor about it through fear of being judged

However

One example I have is... My eldest son (2 years old) has speech problems so he is visited once a week by a female speech therapist. Most of the time my partner isn't home for this so I am the only adult in the house

My anxiety is much worse when in a one-on-one situation with a female so you can imagine how I felt during this hour of the therapist being here. The hour always feels like about 4 hours to me. Every week was the same. I would involuntarily avoid conversation and focus all my attention on my youngest son (10 months old). I always feel angry at myself for this because I am potentially ruining my eldest son's therapy session when I should be heads in and completely focused on my eldest son during these extremely inportant sessions.

I started using my method (explained above) when in these situations and noticed things were actually getting better.

The therapist came again today but this time I opened the front door, as well as asking and answering any questions. I wasn't worrying or panicking, I was actually having a normal conversation with not one, but 2 women, one of them being a complete stranger. It wasn't until the end of the session that I actually realised that I wasn't anxious at all throughout the whole session. Words cannot explain how happy I felt (and still do)! It actually made me feel a little emotional.

Since discovering I had social anxiety I have always been told that I cannot fix it by using my thoughts so I'm confused as to how it actually worked.

Sorry about the wall of text but I had to tell someone :)

[I'm not sure if any of this makes any sense but I tried to explain as best as I could]

THis usually goes something like this:

* 2) you go to a house/flat you have never been before
* 3) you meet people you have never seen before
* 4) you are supposed to talk about how much of an awesome roommate you'd make
* 5) you are supposed to make a lot of smalltalk and generally make a sociable appearance
* 6) awkward silence is a big mood killer

- dress up kinda nice
- prepare a list of things about me they might be interested in

I have hatred towards my parents even though they still support me.  This hatred is directed more at their parenting.  When I was a kid they never made me go up to a cashier to buy something on my own, I feel envious and feel like I wasn’t taught anything as a child by them... my dad is very high strung, he always wanted to do things himself so he could quickly finish them, so I never got the chance to learn anything from him... he gets mad over water being spilled on the kitchen floor or even if something is spilled on a camping table.... he is strict, but towards all the wrong things, and it’s also a passive strictness which I think is worse....I always get the wrong vibe from him.. I sometimes see him with an angry face, but then he begins to talk calmly.. it really annoys me and I hate dealing with him... I feel disgusted by him and fear looking like him... this sunday our family was eating at the table, and I saw the food in his mouth while he did this, I have no chores.. second, pushing him to register for the SAT test (my dad did the registration

then there is the strong feeling of shame I feel when around my parents, a mut, some type of thing that then developed hormones and became even more of a spectacle, something that came out of them... that type of shame... My parents just threw money at me... I went to Catholic schools up until my junior year of high school... I still remember one of the reasons my mom gave to one of my uncles when asked why I was going to a Catholic school: “because they’d make fun of him” my mom said.. and our old house was directly in front of a public school I could have went to at that time, perhaps even with my cousins.. so from a young age I was detached from my immediate surroundings and sen as something too important..  combine that with my dad’s optimism, for example, when asking me what I wanted to major in, he would then proceed to skip all the lower level steps and realities and start talking to me about how he knows someone at work who travels the world and designs buildings in L.A. and how that WILL be me and how I could work at &lt;my dad's work&gt; (where he works) as an architect.. then when I was at &lt;1st community college&gt; taking science classes

I’ve always taken things to heart as a kid because I rarely caused any trouble or misbehaved, I was playing with her hair clip and pretending it was a dinosaur, we were having a good time giggling and chatting, then I was called to write my name on the board, and I never did anything of the sorts again, even outside the classroom... I’ve felt like a pervert ever since scared of offending people... after 2 years at &lt;1st community college&gt; I’ve felt separated from my age group... I feel like I’m living a lie. I’ve always been a right minded instead of a left minded person yet my major is computer science, even despite taking those assessment tests and getting results like archeologist and forest ranger and showing more interest in things like music and 3d rendering and reading about archeology and history instead of computer related topics- but I was scared to waste my parent’s money because college is more beneficial to engineering, and med majors, retaking some of my math and physics classes sometimes more than 2 times, I’ll eventually have to take more physics and some engineering classes

Another lie I is how I portray myself to be this asexual type person when in fact I have deep desires to be in a romantic relationship
 
I feel so old. I feel like I no longer care about love - they are just youthful fantasies. Girls no longer smile at me. I regret never smiling back, not having my own money to be able to afford to eat somewhere, living with my parents, playing computer games, not being able to freely drive wherever I want, etc.. would have meant nothing back then.. it was normal for that age, you were just a kid
 
And there are other factors preventing me from finding someone to love, hormonal, mutt-experiment.. if I showed interest in the opposite sex in front of them. And now this odd fear has bled out into public. I fear showing any hints that I am interested in the opposite sex in front of strangers, like my professors, classmates, and any by stander.
 
What sparked this rant of mine was a dream I had last night of finding someone and feeling lucky and happy about it (it was the first dream in a while I’ve had).. before the dream, I was browsing for classical music pieces I haven’t heard yet
 
&lt;the music piece Huapango set to cinematic clips of places in Mexico and its people&gt;
 
I guess it reminded me of my childhood, my Mexican grandparents who have died, how too Americanized I've become (it feels like I'm living a lie even though I'm a 2nd generation American citizen), how I slowly forgot to speak Spanish even though that was my first language, that time when I was 21 and I was getting so many looks from the ethnic Mexican girls who worked at this restaurant me and my family stopped to eat at in El Paso, Texas (we were driving to my house from my uncle's house in Belton, Texas, …. all the missed opportunities.... I don't know... I feel like I can't flourish in this environment in Southern California - it’s too crowded.. all the concrete.. the pollution.. the culture.. everyone has so many layers to them

What I'm really confused about though, I'm fine with the very few friends I have. But at the same time, I'm not okay with sitting in my house feeling absolutely worthless and like a leech. I want to 'want' to do all these things that normal people do.





Every time I see social anxiety type things it's always people saying things like ""oh I want to get out there with friends and party but other people terrify me"" but I just don't have any desire. I don't know what to do. I want to live a normal and better life





I spent pretty much all day in front of a computer screen. I enjoy playing games and browsing the web

I don't even know where to start or if I even apply here. I'm pretty sure I do. But at the same time, I was always ""the quiet one"" up until 3 or 4 years ago. The way I talk to close friends now is borderline obnoxious in my mind and I hate it but for some reason I can't stop. Pretty much both sides of the fence wind up with me getting depression and I can't find a happy medium.
So with that

Talking on the phone, they tell me to just pick up the phone and call like a normal person. I never answer calls from numbers I don't recognize, and still not from numbers who I recognize but are not terribly close to. I have to be on a SERIOUSLY close relationship with a person to be able to call them. I have never made an exception to that rule in my entire life; aside from a few days ago. I had made a purchase online and received an e-mail that I needed to call the store for some reason. I did my research and found out that they just needed to confirm the billing address. After a few hours of self-therapy and hyperventilation, I finally picked up the phone and called. Waited on hold for a few on the brink of passing out until someone answered the phone. I held the conversation and answered the employee's questions for about a minute before I couldn't take it anymore and hung up. He called back but I didn't answer; too preoccupied with my shaking and lightheadness and this odd taste of blood that I get in the back of my throat when I'm anxious. I was relieved to receive another e-mail saying that my order was cancelled-- it meant I didn't have to call again.
On another note, and I was looking forward to this class all summer. Unfortunately, it's not as I expected. Every day is more group work, as stated by the teacher: ""We're never going to do anything that isn't a game or in groups"". I'm reading the calender and each new event is giving me more and more panic. Tomorrow I have to perform a skit for the class. I almost passed out in my seat when my teacher made this assignment... I still can't believe it's real and I don't know how I'm coping with this or how I'm going to go through with it. There's no way I'm going to address this issue with my teacher, either. If any one of you kind people could give me any advice with doing this is a calm and collected manner (as well as endure the class in general), I would deeply appreciate it. This is what prompted me to sit on the computer and write this anyway.

Something I should have posted earlier: Yes I can make friends. Though I don't have very many. I have lots of acquaintances-- those who I have friendly conversations with. But I choose not to have or hold many close friends. I MUCH prefer to be by myself. Over the summer I only left the house to hang out with friends twice. I don't particularly mind being social, etc. I have a psychologist, though she isn't much help and I don't talk with her much on the personal matters. If she finds something ""wrong"" with me I quickly get defensive and change the subject if I find that her words ring true.

Getting a bit more glum, unwillingly, and it's terrifying to face some things sober (especially since the start of school). I wish it weren't that way. I know it's a road that can land me in trouble if I'm not careful. I'm just unsure of what to do about it; I just want to get some sense of calm. I want to be able to like myself more than two seconds after words fall out of my mouth.

Anyway. That's me. That's why I'm posting here and having a mild freak-out in doing so. I'm sorry if I have said anything you oppose... I always find myself deleting what I've written after one or two downvotes in fear of that dark storm. o_o

*-How do you develop the mindset that your thoughts, and that there is no need for shame when sharing and disseminating them? Maybe this is just a symptom of a ""deeper"" issue.*

[Challenging Negative Thoughts] (http://www.succeedsocially.com/challengethoughts)

[Accepting Negative Thoughts] (http://www.succeedsocially.com/rollwiththoughts)

*I was reading through succeedsocially articles and I believe the ""deeper"" issue is probably cognitive distortions (related links above). Particularly

* Disqualifying the positive
* Jumping to Conclusions
* Magnification/Minimization (Ex: Blowing up a simple social interaction to something as a method of scrutiny when the ""motivation"" for the interaction is not for vigilant scrutiny)
* Catastrophizing (Ex: Assuming that the other person will respond negatively to what I have to do or say)
* Should statements (Ex: I feel like I need to have certain amount of knowledge to answer when it may not be necessary...I think this may be rooted in my perception of elitism
* Personalization (Ex: This kind of goes with the idea of dissociating an action to your identity. I think I need to somehow try to develop the idea that my presence/me may not have been the direct cause for external remarks.)
* Explanatory style (I feel that people may have ulterior motives for innocuous actions (""you're only doing/saying that b/c...)

Recognition is one thing, and practice to ""get over"" these distortions.

I'm not sure

My cousin also has an awesome story about escaping which we love to laugh about

So he was doing an internet based psychology study

So the study was going great and he went there the first time. The teacher said they had to form groups after the break and do some role playing scenarios. He was forced to make a group then and there and after that it was break time. He said he was going out for a smoke

Not much came of it and he had time to recover

So this time they had to form groups again, but the people in his group where kindof on to him. He went outside, but they did too (preparing the presentation as a group). He then said he had to get something from his car as an excuse. He got in, started the car and tried to floor it out of there, however the GATE of the parkinglot was closed (conspiracy?). He couldn't leave and his group was looking at him like ""WTF, really??"".

So he got out and rang the buzzer at the gate

Needless to say after this one

So SA makes it a tiny bit hard to go to classes

My parents gave me 2 or 3 ultimatums before my dad finally said to me that if I don't pass, that's it. I have no son."" That was one of the ""realest"" moments I've had with him and the thought of that made me react in a weird way. I thought to myself, ""Okay, then. You want fucking grades? I'll get your fucking grades!"" and yes I was pissed. I carried this anger every day (even cultivated it!) for the next two semesters and passed every class, even got an A on a 4000 level class. It got results! But I had no peace. Every day when I walked past people I would notice that they take one look at me and want to get away asap. This cultivated more anger. Anger is a strong thing if you submit to it...

I wanted to see how far holding on to anger could take me. I went from staying in my room 90% of the day to pledging at a fraternity the next semester. I got initiated. I looked people dead in the eye and then THEY started looking away. My attitude was basically

So what's the bad part about this? I went from being a mostly compassionate person to hating EVERYTHING. Seriously. Also, there's always the background awkwardness of giving off anger vibes around me and seeing its manifestations on people.

So, backed into a corner when only action would solve anything, then perhaps the best thing to do is what I did: get pissed off.

And you start getting all creeped out and then maybe you start noticing them back? Well I am that awkward person who begins that ugly cycle. Let me explain a little better.

I used to have some major SA problems, a movement across the room -- I would feel my visual attention get dragged away from me. Usually I would just start watching whatever student was next to me, or sometimes a nearby student who impressed or intimidated me in some way. It's not like I would ever stare someone down, but I couldn't help noticing them during the lecture, just out of the corner of my eye while I watched the prof or took notes. If they ever noticed me noticing them, my anxiety spiked through the roof. I'm surprised I never had a panic attack. I even overheard someone mention it to their friend after class one day, so I know I'm not making this up.

Coping strategies in class:  Keeping my head down more frequently. Sitting against one wall of the room and using my long hair to block visual contact to the other side. Angling the frame of my eyeglasses to make it block the person sitting directly next to me. Eventually just stop going to class. This eye thing is no doubt a factor in why I failed so many classes.

Anyway, it might happen a bit, and then I notice it, which only amplifies the anxiety. Sometimes I can just will it to go away, which is awesome. But the real pain in my ass is that I have an acquaintance that caught me doing it to him in some awkward moment, and now I can't hang out with the guy because I keep doing it. O_o

On Friday, which is right next to the health and counseling center. Last spring term, I saw a counselor for my social anxiety and depression, but this was the first time I saw her outside of the office. I was walking down the sidewalk and am pretty sure she made eye contact with me, but I had no idea what to fucking do. The whole time I thought ""what the fuck do I do?"" If you run into a counselor, do you say hello? Do you not say anything? So, not knowing what to do, because I feel I should have said something. 

Basically, but I don't know if it would have been appropriate to say anything, considering almost everything we talked about was supposed to be in confidence. On the other hand, I probably should have said something, because I'm sure she spotted me. I have the same problem anytime I cross paths with a former professor or classmate. I feel like a jerk if I don't say anything, but feel like an idiot if I give them a nod or something and they don't respond.

The way I see it is CBT, I'm well aware that people aren't going to insult me, laugh at me, or ridicule me, I know how absolutely ridiculous that is consciously. But my subsconscious is a different story, it doesn't know irrational from rational, it merely responds to how it has been conditioned over the years. I stumped him, I just wanted to show him how you can have both an irrational response and be completely rational at the same time.

I mean I've been in that situation during college walking through the halls and hearing someone laughing and what do I do? I immediately assume it's me they are laughing at. I tell myself no, no healthy person thinks like that, that's a deep subconscious response.

So I'm gonna go to a hypnotherapist. If that doesn't work I'll give therapy a shot. To me it makes perfect sense and I figure it's worth a shot. The worst thing that happens is it doesn't do anything. It's like weeds

If someone here has experience with CBT please don't hesitate to correct me. Maybe I just had a really shitty experience with a therapist and now I'm biased.

If I don't

I am a 15 year old fairly liked girl who is often told by friends that she is pretty, loyal, etc. Every time I receive such compliments, I am filled with joy and gratitude for the kind people who surround me. Hell, I've even been called 'perfect' a few times. However, after a few moments, the joy fades and I am filled with sadness because I know that everything about me is artificial. 

It's not just the outside. Sure, that is. 

Here's a little bit of context : growing up, or someone that I knew it real life... there was always someone that I was channeling, trying to become, because I envied the integrity of their personality. Personality was something that has always fascinated me : this fact is probably one of the reasons that I started writing novels and short stories, and plan on becoming an actress when I grow up. Plans for my future : my future works, my future goals, my future characters

Why am I fascinated by personality? Probably because I feel like I don't have one. 

I've always seen myself as an open-minded person : when I'm trying to break up a fight, without effort, put myself in the moment and believe I am feeling what the character is feeling. 
To put things shortly, become a completely different person. 
Most would see this as a talent
Something that most of me hates, but the severeness of my case can and has driven me miserable. Don't get me wrong : I'm not depressed. Socially anxious, but not depressed. 
Anyways, innocent girl among my group of friends and coming home to write gory, sadistic stories that I would laugh cruelly at. I swear, there's a twisted girl inside of me that I can't get rid of. 
Most of the time it's not that severe, and behind each persona is a fear of rejection. A fear of being hated. Talking to even the closest of my friends gives me extreme stress, because I overanalyze everything I say and fear that saying something wrong will make others discover what a boring person I really am. I mean, I don't think I'm boring... but others must do. Others have treated me like I am. Which is what has driven me to the point of automatically placing myself as the inferior being in any social situation. 

""How have others treated you?"" You may be wondering. Well, I'd always be fighting for acceptance among people who ignored me, ditched me and replaced me with 'more interesting' people. 
This went on until the end of the 9th grade. Now, having them look at me like they cared about what I was saying was a whole new experience for me. One that I don't feel like I deserve. 
Despite being happier this year

It's funny, kind, etc. They're the ones that did it just to try to prove that they were decent human beings - when they really weren't. 
Kind? I only acted kind around them because I wanted them to think I was. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. Who knows. I don't even know. 
Smart? They were just a bunch of idiots. 
Gorgeous? Sure. If I'm so gorgeous... so smart... so perfect... then what was wrong with me
If I'm all of these things
If I'm so perfect

I don't want to be a whiny teenager, a person here and there might flirt with me for about five minutes, but then something - something pushes them away. The same thing that pushes people away from wanting to be friends with me. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's my awkwardness. Who knows? All I know is that I will always be different, and as my friends all get, lose, and regain boyfriends, I'll be stuck entertaining myself with the characters in my head. 

What's wrong with me? I'm still trying to figure it out. I have a very short temper. I'm emotional. I'm a liar. I'm pathetic. I'm impatient. 
My parents keep telling me I have low capability for empathy - that I have trouble making connections with people. That I can be quite heartless. Of course, it's laughed off. I have no one to turn to. 
Of course

The point of this whole jambled text is that I don't feel like a person. I don't have a personality. I'm independent-thinking, I'm different than everybody else. I repel other people. For reasons unknown. 

Once again, and I've gone through periods of great sadness, but I've never been depressed, and besides; all the pain had been concealable. Now, I'm not trying to be over-dramatic but, I don't know. I just wish someone could see through me. 
But of course

There is so much more to this story that I just don't feel like adding

1335305968.0,sqp0t,Social Anxiety is taking over my mind,occupyhighstreet,16,2,5,"Hi
I'm 24, and only recently have acknowledged that I have social anxiety. In high school I was very shy but had a small group of friends to hang out with. In college I got involved in a lot of campus organizations that gave me a lot of friends. As in most of my college friends were introduced to me. This greatly improved my social skills but its hard for me to meet total strangers, especially cute girls. Now in the real world my old college friends are slowly moving on with their lives and I find myself losing friends now. This makes me feel lonely but I am trying to look at it in a positive light because it is forcing me to confront my social anxiety.

Anyways I have noticed that just acknowledging that I have social anxiety has relieved me a lot. increasingly though, people to talk to, hobbies, etc. I start thinking almost uncontrollably about my anxiety which builds and builds and starts to kill my self esteem. One thing that really helps alot is going for a run. When I run I start to tire and it forces me to think positively so I can motivate myself to keep running. Afterwords I feel a total clearness of my mind and very relaxed. However I can't run all day and I do start to use running almost like alcohol (ex. I'll run before going on a date with a girl, even if it will cause me to be late).

A little background info: I'm 25 m and a recent college grad (graduated in December '11). I was diagnosed with SA back in 2007 and it's been a rough ride. I was seeing a shrink years ago but rather than helping me cognitively I was put on medication. My experience with most medication has been bad. It either hasn't worked at all or worked very mildly and caused more negative effects than positive effects except in one case. I was put on cipralex in 2009 and it changed my life for almost a year. Completely smashed my SA and I've never felt better. But over time it's effect started to wear off and I was back to where I started.

After a few years of doing nothing for myself I started an audio program in November 2011 for SA which I'm still in the process of finishing. I kind of feel like I'm taking psychology as a side study for myself. I've learned so much about SA and how our minds work and what exactly needs to be done to overcome SA. I've seen some progress and have had some really good days / weeks with the program. To give you a jist of it without going into too much detail there's an audio tape about a hour long you have to listen to each week and readings that are included that have to be practiced and read each and every day. Sometimes I spend an hour and a half reading these and putting them into practice.

The thing about making progress is that it constantly puts you on a roller coaster ride of emotion. You may feel great for a few days and then bad for another few which is understandable because I'm essentially trying to break up an irrational thought cycle that I've been using for the past 10 years. You're really supposed to see a relapse as a good thing because you can't have one if you haven't made progress.

Stuff like introductions where you go around saying your name at the start of a class was like walking into the gallows. 


Anyways, which worked OK at the start of the week. I learned the teachers are ALL about presentations here, and having us act as professional therapists even though we're students (I'm going for occupational therapy). 

Yesterday a teacher partnered us with someone to get in front of the class and talk about an assignment. Partner and I were the first ones (which I tend to prefer). I get up there, towards the end everything turns into a blur and I'm not even sure what I said. Didn't read everything. Hands holding paper were shaking, making it worse. Throat tightens making it harder to talk. I manage to look up once to see a face. She was looking like she was trying to make out what the hell I was saying, which made it worse too. Partner does her bit, we sit down, I feel really embarrassed/ashamed. Can't look at the class. Every one else does their bit and no one breaks down at all like me. They look calm and at peace with themselves for the most part, many have fun with it even. They're confident. I feel even worse. You know the feeling? Wishing you could do that too? Making it look easy?

After class I go speak to the teacher at her office to see if she might have any advice for me (I thought she had mentioned in the first class having resources for anxiety, hoping she might of dealt with this before and could help me somehow. I kept struggling to hold back tears, she was nice and helpful. Asked if I was getting treatment, I said no. She suggested I exercise and some other things. After we're done talking I get out of her office to the nearest bathroom and start fucking sobbing. 29 year old man sobbing. Wondering what I'm doing here, and if this was real. I felt the release of my ""dirty secret"" being out now that the class saw me freak (and I'll be with mostly the same people for the next 2.5 years, which makes me more nervous). I felt the tremendous burden of trying to hide this stuff from people over the years, and the impact it has had on my life in general. Went through many feelings/emotions. I might have a family by now

Anyways, Xanax was alright. Any good recommendations? I've heard of beta blockers being good. I know we're all different and react differently to different meds, and the best person for advice is the psychiatrist, but just wondering. Any other advice? I plan on just plowing through this shit and not avoiding anything, but at some point it might catch up with me.

While I know that I'm very irrational about these things

Recently my SO has been staying here a lot, but I suppose it's not superobvious since my room mates aren't home that often. So today one of them said that it felt unfair that he has lived here for 3 months without me discussing it with them first. I told them that we can try to sort it out, I can pay more for the bills since maybe him staying here a lot means higher electricity/water bills and stuff. I also apologized for making them feel like I've ""sneaked him in"" as a room mate. It hasn't been my intention, but I also understand why it could look like that. I also said that we could talk about him staying here less. 

Even though they've expressed their very reasonable concerns in a respectful and calm way, don't want to do anything, except wait for us to talk about it. I'm also terrified of that moment. I've taken anti-anxiety medicine but it only helps so much. I feel like a horrible human being who doesn't deserve to live here.

1369396560.0,1eyrye,Has anyone had anything like this?,stateyourname101,16,2,8,"Firstly I made this account just for anxiety posts as some friends know my regular reddit name and I would be too embarrassed if any of them read this.  

Anxiety started to hit me around middle school and in high school got to the point where I would feel dizzy when I was around large groups of people. I had a surgery at 15 and had the laughing gas before they did the IV to knock me out. As I was going under I had an intense panic and tried to open my eyes and could see the doctors standing over me and the surgery table lights then my eyes shut but my mind kept on. I kept seeing that same image of the doctors and light over and over again and I was convinced that my consciousness was stuck like this forever. I would never speak with anyone or do anything ever again, everyday I would wake up and that terror was there, that realization that this life could just be a temporary glitch in that emptiness and that I would return to it soon. It is a fear and anxiety that cannot be consoled and does not end. I have tried to look at it logically, that I had these feelings of loneliness beforehand and the anesthesia brought them out but having felt something so horrible I have found it impossible to completely recover. I think it is similar to living with PTSD. I have never really fully explained this to anyone and it feels sort of good to have written it down. Thanks to anyone who managed to finish it I'm sure its full of grammatical errors. Any comments, concerns, advice, similar stories would be greatly appreciated.

1366756147.0,1cyul1,I need advice,SAThrowawayy,16,3,7,"I've been meaning to ask this for a while now which is one of the reasons that I actually got a reddit account in the first place. I don't know where to begin really so I guess I'll just ramble.

I guess what made me write this now is that I'm just so miserable nearly everyday. Especially after any failed social iteractions

I've been shy for as long as I can remember. I can still remember back to when I was 4/5 and even then I had no friends and didn't talk to anyone outside of my immediate family. Now though it's starting to affect my life. I've been at uni for 7 months now and still haven't made a friend. I don't even know what some people look like who live in the same building. Even when I manage to actually talk to another human being I just can't turn it into a friendship or anything. Eventually the people that tried to make friends with me just get bored and give up. I don't even have online friends. I even struggle with posting things on the internet

If I do go out I just tend to pour as much alcohol down my throat until I don't care enough and will start talking to people. Before any of you say yes I know that it doesn't actual make you better at socialising or anything. If I do start talking without any alcohol, I just blurt out anything. I can get really hot and sweaty, my voice goes shaky. I could go on forever. It normally just ends up with me being depressed after anyhow, even if I do have a good time, after I have analysed how badly I messed up every conversation and when I remember I said something incrediably stupid. Thinking everyone will be judging me, even though rationally I know they probably don't care or have enough time to judge me on every little thing.

I feel as though my shyness has also affected other aspects of my life. I pretty overweight and really want to lose it and get into shape

The problem is though I feel I am just being lazy and taking the easy way out. I can't just be being wimp there has to be some sort of medical problem wrong with me. I have tried to talk to family and friends about it but I have trouble expressing myself as you might imagine and I don't want to worry them especially my family. The vibe I get though is that they just think I'm weird. So I guess I'm asking you lot

Around large groups of people, make tons of friends, pretty much everything I felt like I was missing out on at home (my parents are Asian and extremely strict). Even as I tried, I felt like none of my room mates wanted to hang out or party with a person like me. I even pledged for a sorority but that ended badly. During my pledging quarter, I felt like I finally had friends and spent most of my time with them. My grades dropped and I got dismissed. Now, 4 years later I'm still at a JC.

I never feel like I'm good enough. I always say sorry and I am very passive. When some co-workers blame their faults on me

I decided to post today because I felt like today was worse than most. I like to smile and smiled at some classmates today but they just looked at me. Did I do something wrong? I just want to be friendly and maybe make some friends. Recently I've learned to accept that I'm an introvert and usually just hang to myself. In previous semesters, or have to try and find things to say. And I saw another one of my classmates roll her eyes at me as I was walking by. Am I seeing things? Now I just feel even worse ... :(


**TL;DR**: I used to want to be outgoing and have friends


EDIT: Some formatting.

&amp;I forgot to add, or making other people feel bad. My SO always tells me to stop worrying about what others think because no one is looking at me. I always try to take his advice, but it only lasts for so long. And I'm back to myself.

I went on my first plane today. Then I went on two more. I travelled a total of 3600 miles. Normally I would be in a big ol panic about something as big as this, and during this time I'd just see so many people, having normal lives. Normal people, having normal talks. People crying as they said bye. Just fucking normal n shit. So much of it. I couldn't get away from it. I have never felt more out of place in my life. Seeing this reminded me of how I'll never be like any of them. It really hurt. My inner emotions shed a few tears. My outer emotions were fine because I was eating a quiznos sub and was with my dad so I had to act brave.
Moving on. So I flew halfway across Canada with my dad for work. I'm going to be up here staying with him for 6 months. We're in Alberta in case anyone was interested. I'd be semi excited for this. But man it's bad. He has 2 room mates, she mentioned how it's always hard moving up here. She said I just needed a few friends and it'd be fine. Wrong bitch. I need the exact opposite of that. Then she tells me her son is coming up later. Jesus CHRIST. I am so angry over this. I am dreading every second that passes by. Her son is just going to be here at any moment, I'm sure he's all hip and shit and probably a drug dealer. And I'm assuming we're going to be stuck together while her and my dad do shit. I literally am about to jump out the window. Why does this shit have to happen. Another thing. I'm too scared to go get a drink. I am parched like a son of a bitch. But I don't want to go out there and casually take something that I don't own. I'm just so uncomfortable. Idk how I'm going to eat or drink anything. I'm not going to be able to masturbate for a long time since I sleep in the same room as my dad. I'm going to have to be around 3 people every single day. Somebody come and kidnap me or some shit.
