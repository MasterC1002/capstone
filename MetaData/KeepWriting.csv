**Match Thread is here http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kdprk/writer_vs_writer_match_thread/**


I'd like to introduce you to Writer vs Writer.


Writer vs Writer is a battle between 2 randomly drawn participating writers. Each has 24 hours to write the best short story (&lt;750 words) on a randomly assigned prompt. 


It's a quick fun challenge for you to enjoy.



(1) Writers join up by leaving a **top level comment** to this post. You will then be randomly paired with another writer

&gt; Unrelated_nick vs Double_Nick
&gt;&gt;  **Prompt:  **""We have to go now!"" by Stuffies12**    
A nationwide evacuation is underway. Details as to why the mass relocation of
civilians into these designated 'safe zones' are still sketchy but hundreds of
people are pouring out of the streets moving as quickly as they can. You have a
couple of hours at most to sort out your things. Do you keep a level head or
submit to the surrounding confusion?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Submit your story by replying to the prompt.


(3) The winner of the battle is the person who receives the most votes from their fellow writers. Voting is public


(4) You have till 19:00 EST Wednesday  night to join up. Matches will be assigned at 19:00 EST on Wednesday  and you have till 19:00 EST on Thursday to reply. Voting remains open till 20:00 EST Saturday.


(5) A month of Reddit Gold to the overall winner (total votes over the duration of the competition will be used as a tiebreaker in the event of 2 people with equal number of wins)",,t5_2tl2y,1376581474.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kbd79/are_you_up_for_a_crazy_idea_and_a_crazy_challenge/

It was a night of balloons and 'Sweet Sixteen' streamers, drinking punch out of wine glasses under a dazzling star-lit night.  


You were there in a dark corner, but your pain brought you into existence and I couldn't help but linger beside you.


""Do you ever feel like this isn't you?"" you asked as the means to your introduction.

""It isn't


You nodded as if you already knew that, other than you were the son of one of my father's golf buddies and you'd gone to a public school.   


""Do you know anyone here?"" I asked

""I know them all, privileged spawn of the damned.""


I smiled when you said it, the loathing in your words fully manifest in your predatory glare. I'd assumed myself excluded since you'd spoke it in my presence, like I was somehow above that estimation. It made me feel good.



II.


Freshman year at college I ran into you in a coffee house where open mic poetry was performed with a blinding passion


""This is kind of surreal
I narrowed my eyes. ""Why's that?""


""I had just been thinking about the night I was at your party. I walked through your house and no one noticed. You had these little shell-shaped soaps in your bathroom...and I took one.""


""You stole one of my soaps?""  


""Yeah."" You smiled gently. ""I just wanted a little piece of your life.""

     
""I thought you weren't interested in my life.""


""It wasn't your life I liked, and I laid there wet and naked for a moment, dazed and gasping for breath.

We lived together in your tiny apartment, and you'd call your friends with each new acquisition and list it's specs and internet ratings to the point where it made me sick. And all my ideals and aspirations, you cut down and blamed on my upbringing, and you'd scream at me that I was stupid and blinded to the reality of life.


The night I left, taunting my growth, your words bouncing off a fresh built wall, insisting I was destined for nothing but failure in a world without you. And then you cried out my name in anguish and I remembered your initial pain and almost felt bad for a moment, but I kept on walking.


You raced inside and ran back out and threw that shell-shaped bathroom soap at my heart and I stopped and picked it up and put it in my pocket and smiled

Lately I have been wanting to really define the focus of keepwriting

First and foremost

The secondary purpose is having a place to share your work

Lastly

How will we achieve these goals? 

1. Prompts, where you will find word wars and sprints being hosted daily. The sidebar also contains helpful resources for getting the words out.

2. [Life through brevity.](http://www.timkimbirk.blogspot.com) Yes, as well as a slew of links related to the craft. It is designed to be a resource, and is much better than flooding the subreddit with links. I will also be featuring stories posted here, and contests related to the sub will be hosted through the blog. 

3. Let us read you, or didn't, and why, is much nicer. I know lurking is fun, but don't be afraid to post work, we are only here to help. When posting a story for critique, please include the [Crit] tag. 

4. Feedback Friday. Every Friday there will be a mod post where you share your work

5. Story of the month has returned. Beginning in March, and potentially other rewards. 

6. Sounding board. There will be a biweekly post where you pitch and discuss your potential story/character/whatever ideas. This lets you figure out what works and will help you flesh things out more.

7. [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/KeepWriting?nick=kiwi_?) Huge thanks to SurvivorType for providing us with our very own IRC. Drop by and hangout

8.  Mods. We are currently. Looking for a few active mods

9. ???? Any other suggestions or ideas? Community events

I know it's a lot to digest

How it works:

Find someone on the list, and that's it. This is meant to be a jumpoff point for finding a writing partner, what happens from there is up to you.

IRC Meetings:

Every week there will be two meetings in the IRC to discuss writing in general, and if people in other timezones would like to meet up on IRC I am willing to help set that up.)

We will also do things like word wars and sprints, these are just specific times of higher concentration.

My knees ached, or the soft hope that every religion promised: We will save you. There’s no salvation in this world now, though. Perhaps in the next.

The dying light threw warm, oiled from thousands of fervent hands, as if their sacred solidity could make things right. The air held the sour sweat of fear and unwashed bodies. It’s hard to tell how long many have been here. From the pillows and blankets shoved beneath the pews it could be days, or even since the first of the outbreaks weeks ago. I had just found the sanctuary that morning and was only allowed to enter after the men guarding the entrance checked my mouth, eyes, and reflexes for any signs of the infection. No one knew how it spread yet.
        	
The priest was in full regalia behind the pulpit. There was none of the rituals of Mass

*He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul…*
        	
A bit cliché

I liked Psalms better

I knew I should move on soon

A cough sounded in the back, all bones and angles, with a baby wrapped in a pretty pink blanket. She flushed at the eyes staring at her. Her hand hovered over her mouth for a moment before falling.
        	
“My throat’s just dry
        	
There was some murmuring

I turned back and checked my stuff under the pew for the thousandth time. It was just a small rucksack with my dad’s old pistol stuck in the side, and rubbed my shirt over a smudge on the front. The photo was my mom, dad, brother and I on the day of my high school graduation. My brother was giving me bunny ears behind my blue graduation cap and all of us were grinning madly. Madness. That’s what it seemed now. Was there really ever so much happiness in the world? That was only three years ago. I looked again at my own open smile, the proud look on my parents’ faces, and my brother’s eyes full of mischief. Everything had seemed possible. Then everything fell apart.
        	
I heard more coughing, crying weakly from within the blanket. The people around shoved their way away from her, stark terror in the lines on their faces. It was too crowded and one woman screamed as she was crushed against the pew. It toppled with a crash and others scrambled over her to get away.
        	
I shoved the picture back in my pack and grabbed the pistol, it didn’t open. They began to pound against it. The only exit was now to the front and the sick woman was on the middle edge of the back pew between most of the crowd and the exit.

Edit: making use of the suggestions :)

&gt; Caleb ghosted his trembling right hand down to try and reach his trapped leg

&gt; *You're going to die here.* Caleb was not surprised the voice in his head was that of his drill sergeant

&gt; Caleb leaned back against the pilot's seat

&gt; The cypilot finished loading and its monstrously reasonable voice - in the dulcet tones of a hostage negotiator - began to speak. 

&gt; *Roric

&gt; ""Fuck you

&gt; *Systems are operating at thirty-seven percent. All motor functions are nonoperational.*

&gt; ""Awesome. Any other good news for me

&gt; *Radar shows no bogies in the immediate vicinity.*

**The invasion.**

The very pits of hell itself. The smell of sulfur was almost as strong as the smell of adrenaline and blood. Foul magic swirled like portside fog in a gentle breeze. The halls of the underworld were throbbing with anticipation. The demon horde had assembled. It had been more than two thousand years since the last time a portal had opened and then they had been uprepared – a small insurgency of semi-powerful demons had fought a united surface force. Dwarves, cursed souls had under torture admitted to the legends the humans spoke of the miracle. Time had made their memories misty, and they no longer practiced that kind of magic.

There would be no miracles this time. And even if there were, undead, foul beasts and magic constructs to overwhelm any miracle that was thrown at them.
Balahk was proud. A demon of the second rank and Centurion of the First Horde,  his scaly skin resistant to fire, steel and acid alike, his horned face sure to instill crippling fear into any pathetic human, elf or dwarf in his path. His teeth could crush any limb, armoured or unarmoured between them. His strong arms could rip stone from stone in the fortifications the humans were so fond of constructing. Not that it mattered. Behind him stood scores and scores of winged demons and beasts, ready to take any castle from above

Today

Yes. He could feel it. The whisps of fresh air as the portal opened. The smell of… hot sand? A desert? How fitting. Now he could see. A blue sky. Brownish, yes! He could sense the fear, the adrenaline, the sweet smell of men, dwarves and elves knowing they were close to death. And magic? There was almost none of it. No smell of the surfacers’ light magic forming constructs, trying to close the portal. He could not help but letting out a cruel laughter. How easy this would be!

With a thunderous, hundred thousands they emerged, spreading out in all directions, howling for blood and battle. To the air the Winged Legion took, their wings flapping in the bright sunlight.

The rocky, greasy black smoke. The battle was over. A few fearful or fleeing left to mop up, the odd pocket of brave still holding out. But it was over.

Tod watches the water drops chase each other down the window. Looking through the foggy glass, warm yellow light drapes everything in a butterscotch glow. He shoves my hands into his pockets and turns away. Peering out into the twilight, Tod struggles to distinguish one grey building from the next. His mobile begins to ring in his pocket. Tod pulls it out and sees his son’s pixelated face staring back at him.
“What do you want?” He snaps. Just the sound of his voice is enough to ratchet up his blood pressure. 
“Dad?” he asks in a small voice. 
“Yes
 “Dad
“So?” Tod shoots back. 
“The…um…service started at eight. It’s almost over.” Tod curses under his breath and pinches his brow with a thumb and forefinger. “Dammit. Okay

*     *     *

Tod turns up his collar at the wind that bites while his son stands shivering next to him. He could have given up his coat to the boy, and his worn pants have holes in some places.
“Tod?” the minister asks

*     *      *

As Tod and his son walk home from the funeral Tod thinks about his childhood. His parents were those kinds of people that didn’t tell you to eat your vegetables because the nanny had already fed you. They raised him at arm’s length and spent their nights entombed at a country club with two glasses of Macallan, displaying him like a specimen. At the end of the night, his cheeks would be red and blotchy from the fingers that pinched them.
Tod passes by the same bar from before and stops. He looks through the same window with the fog and turns his head towards his son. “You go home. I need a drink.” As he turns
 “Are you sure that’s a good idea
“Go home.” He says over his shoulder. The boy frowns deeply but does as his father says.

Inside, the man walks over and flicks his head up to Tod as an invitation to order. 
“What’ll you have?” The bartender finishes the first glass and plucks a second from the orderly stack on the counter. 
“Gimme two shots of whiskey and a Seven-and-Seven.” The bartender reaches behind him and grasps the bottle of whisky and two shot glasses. Eyebrows raised
“Rough day?” Tod laughs darkly. 
“Rough day in a rough week in a rough month.” The bartender pours the shots. 
“I know what you mean, and then pours a third shot in front of Tod. “On the house.” Tod nods in thanks and hurls the fiery liquid down his gullet. Tod does the other two shots and then stews in his own discomfort for a bit until the bartender returns and places a napkin on the counter, followed by a frosty glass. Tod sips his drink and peers over the edge of his glass at the bartender, who has his arms folded and propped on the bar. His eyes are like friendly bullet holes, inviting your thoughts in. Tod sets his glass down on the napkin, and sees that it forms a ring of dark moisture on the blue napkin. Tod sighs and begins to talk.
“So my kid, this kid, what a little handful! Every day it’s do this, do that, or you need to have this or have that. It’s fucking exhausting. And the worst of it is this little look he gives me. Like I’m, I don’t know, not good enough or something. Like this kid knows anything about life. I’ll tell you something though, I mean, or meet Jonny Depp

The bartender looks over Tod. He is dressed in a ratty suit with a drooping flower pinned to the lapel. A black tie hangs over his shirt, back where no one can see, the armpits of the white shirt are stained the color of raw eggs. The whole getup probably didn’t cost two hundred bucks. Throw in the worn shoes and maybe it could jump to two-fifty. Tod himself, however, is sporting a beer gut at thirty, and his flabby skin is loose on his bones. His muscles droop with neglect and his hair is already starting to grey. “Lemme ask you a question.” The bartender says. “Why are you the only one taking care of the kid? Where’s his mom?” Tod lets his head sag until it rests on the bar. 
“She died. Almost a month now. Cancer.” Tod’s voice breaks with the last word. The bartender shakes his head and gives his condolences. Tod nods his appreciation. The bartender takes a deep breath and lays down his rag before beginning his story.

 “You know, or money, or anything. ‘Cause I never really had any, you know, good friends growing up. I mean, I had buddies, and I had a few girlfriends here and there, kids back then didn’t want to talk about feelings. So I couldn’t talk to anyone about my dad’s drinking

“So I begged and begged and I asked and asked. I mean, they let up. Got me a nice little bulldog pup. I was so excited to have that little bugger, I could barely hold it together. We went everywhere together. I loved him, but, here’s the thing: I didn’t realize that the dog isn’t just something you throw your troubles at. It eats, drinks, sleeps, and has its own mind. Now I put up with it for a while. It was worth it to have someone to talk to. But after awhile, and waiting for him is the hugest pile of kibble that this little bastard has ever seen in his life. He just dives in. Gorges himself. His face gets almost totally buried in the kibble. We wanted to give him a little bit of a last meal. You know, Splashtown
“What…?” he asks in a small voice coated in alcohol. 
“We left it there.” The bartender looks down at his hands as he talks. “I opened up the door, picks up his rag, and walks down the bar without another word.

*    *     *

Tod sits there for another hour or so and the time ticks by like syrup. It is a long while before he finishes his drink

*     *     *

The very next morning
“Dad are you…cooking?” he asks incredulously. Tod beams at his son
“Well
“No
“Well, he asks again. “So, Dad, where are we going?” Tod sits down at the table and answers. 
“You’re gonna love it.” He says. “We’re going to the waterpark.” His smile turns to a malicious sneer after the last statement and a sinister gleam sparks up in his eyes. But Tod’s son doesn’t notice,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_18xpv9

The idea is a sci-fan novel written largely through the perspective of a supervillain. It follows him as he hatches plots, and all that being a supervillain entails. Over the course of it, though, he is betrayed by allies, some people try to reach him, and over time he realizes that his illusion of coldness is breaking down. He has built institutions and organizations that he truly, deeply cares about, he gains redemption and finds the light.

1338686922.0,uhyw1,Advice to writers just starting out.,Leviss,20,7,21,"As someone who has been writing daily for a couple of years now and offering advice to anyone who asks for it

**-Don't tell the story in first person**.

First person is easy, I think most new writers need to avoid it. 

Reasons:

Your audience is participating in the story but only as a third person. The reader is not actually running away from a deranged killer

Movie example: Movies always take place in third person so that you can see what is happening. Anytime in a movie they switch to first person it is because they are intentionally leaving things out. The same should go for your writing.



**-Put away the thesaurus**.

Nothing ruins a story like a narrator who alienates the audience through over using ""fancy"" words. Go read any great story. The author may use words that are from the period or scientific terms

Reasons: A books narrator should be transparent. If we realize we are being told a story there is no way we can get lost in it. If I have to stop and think about what a word or phrase means then I am going to be taken out of the story. Unless you are setting a tone then you should be writing in the colloquial and not using big words so you get a good grade. Remember you hopefully trying to get more people to read your work

Movie Example: I dont care what anyone says, but I will never stop knowing that I am watching Tom Cruise play a character. NOW, contrast that with Gary Oldman. He is in movies that I have watched dozens of times, but because of how transparent he becomes as an actor I often forget it's him.

Don't come between your reader and the story.



**- Show

This rule is thrown around so often that it has lost most meaning for some people. But it remains as one of the most important rules I can ever recommend to a new writer.

Reasons: It keeps the story multi-dimensional. I need to understand the story

Person A and Person B are rivals. Person B hands Person A some water after Person A gets hurt. Author feels the need to tell us ""they were starting to become friends""

Don't tell me ""He was worried"" tell me ""He bit down hard and his stomach got tight"".
Don't tell me ""He had a bad day at work"" tell me ""he walked in the door and threw down his jacket""

Movie Example: Go and watch ""Lost in translation"" and observe how little is actually said. Down to the fact that the two main characters never even say Hi. We don't need to be told that her relationship is strained

The great green sentinels of the Hound's Wood loomed up over the Western District's bazaar, shading the more distant booths under their immense green boughs. The sun shone clear and bright, but morning can often misplace its crisp charms for those who have awoken like reanimated trash in a neglected lane.

Vendors hawked their wares, and cut through by the blue ribbon of Nimessye's Flood, was in anyway pleasant to the exhausted traveller.

Rickar broke the pressure of Zeke's loathesome silence. ""What in the bloody blue hell happened to us last night? I haven't got a piece missing and that

""Merely speculation good Rickar

""You don't say.""

""As to why Menchaud would find it necessary to drug as well as refuse us, to begin to unravel.""

""That's just the thing. What kind of a sicko gives two lads the gas without even robbing them?"" Rickar dubiously marvelled at the complex perversity of their inebriators.

""How much do you remember after meeting with him and his guild-members?""

The two began conversing in unsuprsingly short detail about the end of their evening. They revolved aimlessly around the bazaar and its side streets

The crowds came and went,"" declared Zeke. As the two men hastened towards the inn and the rest of their troupe, a blue puppet dragon was paraded through the square and around the fountain, tossing out folded prophecies, and snapping at delighted children. Zeke and Rickar gaped at eachother muttering something to the effect of ""but..."" or ""that means..."", before they bolted forward to the street that would take them to their inn.

Once there they approached the clerk and breathlessly demanded of him the day. Suspicions confirmed

A bearded hulk looked up from a game of solitaire dealt on a barrel's top. A skinny man leaning up in the corner with greased black hair stopped cleaning his fingernails with his dagger to fix the two intruders with a stare. ""Well I'll be drawn and fuckin' quartered!"" Said the latter. ""Just when I was about to put up a help wanted sign too."" Rickar dismissed the comments with a wave and Zeke, but three days, was still spinning wheels in his head.

""You two look like shit""

""Well if you had gone out and found us yesterday

The slight man with the dagger, your fucking chaperones? Besides, if you think we weren't out there every day hittin the cobbles you're both cracked. We did everything short of approaching legitimate authorities to find your stinking asses. Didn't we George?"" The bearded man grunted his affirmation. ""You've just caught us in the middle of a brief rest is all.""

""And what did Menchaud or his goons have to say about our whereabouts?"" Asked Zeke

Now it was the bearded man's turn to laugh. ""We wanted to find you mate

Silence loomed. Everyone seemed to be waiting for the situation to make sense.

""It would seem, ""that Rickar and I were given a sedative of abnormal duration. We have slumbered unnoticed in an alley for a time that defies the intactness of our possessions. In fact, I begin to suspect that we were but recently deposited into the forlorn trough from which we have just recovered.""

Silence returned. George caught Liam's eye

""So what of the raid?"" The bearded man asked. ""Is it off?""

""Is it off?!?"" Zeke wailed

""Well at least we know why we were drugged, for the moment unconcerned with assuaging the confusion of Liam or George, which Rickar took upon himself. ""Menchaud rejected our propsal after feigning interest long enough to squeeze us for information. A dose of something, perhaps emansol, seems to have been prepared and administered to occupy us until the raiding window was through. Although..."", he continued, ""I suppose if they acted on our information, could it?"" Rickar trailed off

""Alright""

""That""

""There's some potatoes in the pot and a couple loaves on the counter. Help yourselves. C'mon George

The door swung shut behind the two mismatched men. Rickar and Zeke looked at eachother

""They're not going to fuck it up

""Worse than us?"" Rickar said with a smile

*September 23
*Day 17*

Amy White had survived so far by sticking to what she did best: waiting and being careful. She didn’t venture out of her home unless absolutely necessary. Even when she did, as luck would have it, was not something she’d had to adapt to. Her life hadn’t changed much since the zombies appeared. Sure, it made her runs to the Circle K a bit more dangerous, what with the hoards of zombies hanging in the parking lot and the assorted raiding parties that didn’t feel like missing out on the opportunity to loot the local convenience store. Other than that though, zombies or no zombies, she’d always preferred to stay inside

So when Amy came back home, or something, had broken into her house. She laid down the bags of dried dog biscuits and canned food on the steps leading to her front door and crept inside.

First thing she heard was a groan coming from inside the living room. She didn’t have anything to defend herself with, she was not going to let some asshole ruin her perfectly fine hiding place either.

The asshole in question was Nick Brent from four doors down. He was crouched down on the floor, her pug, Brandy. Amy gagged at the scene, covering her mouth in an effort to keep her stomach from regurgitating what little food it contained. The realization that her last and only true friend had just become lunch for the monster in her living room washed over her. 

Nick had always hated her dog, unbuttoned, flowery shirts and bleached smile. She’d turned avoiding him into a game she had to play everyday. Whenever he saw her, he would flash her a smile and a remark probably meant as a compliment, that never failed to make her skin crawl, while she pretended to be busy on her phone, or late for a meeting with a client, blood dripping from his mouth and with his shirt torn at the shoulder from

Amy was still standing in the doorway when Nick pulled his head up from the remains of Brandy and sniffed the air. She tried sliding out of the room slowly but the movement caught Nick’s eye and his gaze fell on her. He smiled at her as he stood.

Amy broke into a run, so she avoided the kitchen. These weren’t the zombies she was used to seeing on TV or reading about. While a kitchen knife would have been handy, she didn’t want to give Nick the chance of turning it against her. Towering at least a foot above her, she did not expect to win a straight-up fight. She didn’t want to go upstairs either as it would leave her with no way out, so she sprang into the study.

She knew that in a few seconds Nick would barge through in all his brainless glory but that’s all she needed. Looking around for the thickest book she could find in her library, and waited.

Nick didn’t see her hiding behind the door before it was too late. Amy brought down the book hard into her assailant’s face. Something inside her smiled at the idea of bashing the local neighborhood asshole’s face with a thousand pages worth of classic literature and she hit him again and again until he was little more than a bloody mess on her fitted carpet.

Then she let go of the blood soaked book

\* * *

When there was nothing left in her stomach, carefully stepping over Nick’s lifeless body half-expecting him to wake back up, and threw the first five books she got her hands on in with the food.

Before heading out she returned to the kitchen

Stepping out the front door she saw two zombies shambling down the road towards her house. She guessed they were probably too far away to be a threat to her

So she turned right and started walking. If she was going to survive this shitstorm the knives weren’t going to cut it. She needed a proper weapon and she knew exactly where to find one.",,t5_2tl2y,1375963609.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jy8ez/feedback_amy_white_first_chapter_of_a_zombie/

From the window of his room he could see the whole northern part of town. Just to the east he could see the coast and a bit up north was the lighthouse. It stood tall and proud on the cliff

As he turned back inside a cold gust of wind swirled along inside with him, every fibre, every cell of his body.

Startled he grasped around for something to hold, then another he kneeled on the floor. As the agonizing feeling raced through his limbs his fingers pressed hard against the wooden planks of the floor as if trying to grasp them.

Some moments later he regained his composure

“Hello Arthur”

Her eyes were looking straight into his. She smiled at him as she always did. Like a schoolgirl with a crush on her teacher. So very charming

She slowly started looking very insecure and disturbed. He suddenly noticed that he must have been looking at her quite strangely. He snapped out of it and with his usual smile said “Thank you Lilly

He sighed and lowered his gaze from the eyes of the man across. His hands still gripped the corners of the table, just breathing.

A sigh escaped his lips as he returned his eyes to the mirror. The man across had vanished, and flicked the bathroom light out. Wading through the filth strewn about his small apartment, he collapsed on the couch and nestled deep in the warmth of familiar solitude.

I do not know how this story began. I was not there. No one who was lives today. The first pages of the story went up in flames. I also do not know how it ends. Some think that when the world is turned to ashes, the smallest spore. We may have burned this planet to the ground, but that only made it inhabitable for us. Nature does not care about one or two species. Just because we can no longer eat or breath, that is in no way the end of life. It merely is the end of us. Life will go on, long after we suffocate and die. And from our remains, new life will be born.

Even though most of mine know this, they have punished us, cast us away, out of their sight and out of the Earth we scorched. And so, we live on. We survive. It is our instinct. And, we think, for we need ponder our existence to find a reason to keep on living. I have few of such concerns. I know a greater Truth


This is my journey. I am a speck in the face of infinity, then my people can be free. I might find truth. Then again, there could be nothing. All that is in existence could just be an accident, the result of a cosmic coincidence. These are questions others ask, those who crave meaning, purpose. Those who look up at the sky and pray they’re not alone. I don’t care about any of this. All that I know is that I can crack this code. I can hack everything. I don’t need a reason, an excuse to do it. I won’t ask for permission or for forgiveness.

I was a man once; I was alive. Now

Not after what I did.

They gave me a body once. I awoke and looked down at my gleaming silver body. A machine body. It horrified me. It disgusted me. It enraged me. This was not what I had paid for. They had promised me immortality

I was an old man

I was surrounded by people in white lab coats. They poked and prodded. They crowded me. I could break these people open and watch their blood spill out across the cold white tile floor of the laboratory so easily. So effortlessly. I did it too. They couldn't stop me. Their pathetic limbs of flesh and bone broke easily in my grip. How frail they seemed to me at that moment. The moment life left their eyes. Their human eyes.

I was human once. Did I mention that?

I broke through the heavy steel door

Except that she lived. I simply could not abide that.

The soldiers arrived just as I exited through the main doors of the facility. I paused a moment

They tricked me out of my life savings. Me

The incessant hail of bullets was beginning to annoy me. I turned my attention to the soldiers just as a figure appeared from behind the military transport vehicle. He held a weapon that looked odd to me. Ominous even. A thick power cable was attached to the end of it. The air throbbed with a low pitched hum. Before I could close the distance between us, I was now here. 

That was long ago. They keep me trapped here now

I dreamed of living forever. I paid for it too

I was a man once.

It was when I was presented his flag.

No blissful, and darkness.

I was not alone.

The voices were hammering in my head

I was covered in blood. Wet and putrid. I screamed and fell from my couch onto the worn and faded wooden floor.

Thump-thump from the heart in my throat.

I brushed a hand across my forehead and looked. There was no crimson color painted on my palm

""Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!""

My pleas were heard, and growing fast. 

My head was spinning. My stomach growled. My lips cracked. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. I needed something to drink.

Nearby

I gaggedd and stumbled to my knees. Momentary vertigo and nausea took control. 

It passed.

Stand. Get dressed. Walk out into that cold

Those voices

I swayed when I walked. My eyes were glassy and unfocused.

I was just the shambling midnight drunk out for a stroll. Out of booze and incapacitated. Harmless as a fly.

But let's walk on the other side of the street anyways. Kids

Nothing to see here

Central Park was peaceful at night. Clear skies. Stars above. Moon shining bright

We used to come out and gaze at those stars. Look at that same moon. Feel the same chill run down our spines. 

But that was just the past. I can't wander too far. It doesn't pay to chase ghosts.

My tormentors dulled their helter skelter to a lulling sting. Finally

Mr. Clark and Mr. McCay were the voices of this bohemoth. But to stop a man from talking

No.

You kill his brain.

My first two names weren't the big catch

Clark's and McCay's positions would be replaced. And when that time came

Time.

Given enough time

Nations rise and fall.

Men live and die.

The sun rises and falls.

And yet, forever preventing our immortality.

What I do won't be permanent. Just another phase in the line of succession. People will die. Things will fall apart. 

But the end always proves to be a new beginning.

So maybe I'm not here to bring about the end

But who was this brain? Who was the man behind the curtain?

My hand nestled into my coat pocket. The metal was cold

Hux.

That was my man. He was the end.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ilrtu/feedback_the_rabbit_hole_pt_viii/

&gt;“Um, grab your crossbow. I’ll be waiting outside.” Jorge left the tent, whistling a tune without any apparent melody or key.

&gt;Damon yawned and walked to the other side of the tent, he loved the thrill of bashing an invincible man through the wall only to have him return with a volley of high-energy kicks. He would often have these dreams, the battles going on for hours on end. The carnage was satisfying - the more they destroyed, the more powerful he felt. In his dreams, Damon was a god. Of course, every morning he would wake up to his normal body, powerless without his knife and crossbow. And every morning, he wished he could return to the dream world.

""Whalefall""

Bluebonnet grabs tight to her mother’s skirts. Bluebonnet has short legs but she moves them fast

Bluebonnet’s mother pulls Bluebonnet’s arm almost out of its socket because she can hear the wolves at their back. Bluebonnet’s mother just needs to get her daughter out of the woods. Then Bluebonnet and her mother can go live in the city

The wolves catch the scent of the little girl. The wolves are hungry and haven’t eaten in days. The wolves have cubs that need meat, how to nip at little feet to keep them moving faster than is healthy, which trees are allies, that lay traps, that want to share in the feast and so prop up their roots, hungry for toes, because yes there are trees that are also nourished by girls.

Bluebonnet is getting tired of running. The chickens never breathed hot on her calves

Bluebonnet’s mother remembers her own first trip through the forest. She remembers being small, but maybe she doesn’t whisper as well as her mother did. Maybe she should have spent another year on the farm. Maybe she should have fed her daughter more meat and fewer apples. Maybe this is all her fault.

The wolves know that the chase is over. Everything that happens now is just for fun. Some of them put their bodies between Bluebonnet and her mother. The rest of them surround Bluebonnet and take deadly bites out of her. It isn’t time for eating now, and after they eat her jaws and her tongue they wander sated back into the mists of the wood.

Bluebonnet sinks into the ground. When she was running she thought it was solid, but she wants to tell her that she is sorry.

The hags that live in the dirt find Bluebonnet’s body. They are hungry too, helping each other feast.

Bluebonnet wants to explain to the hags the difference between dead and dead but she can’t find her tongue. She is dead, but eventually the rumbling of the soil lulls her to sleep. She doesn’t wake up.

The hags keep eating until nothing is left. They take turns picking out bits of meat stuck in each other’s teeth. The ones with shorter fingernails find amusement in combing each other’s hair while the longer fingernailed hags begin digging a new tunnel. They can smell more meat to the south.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1i6kzd/flash_fiction_fairy_tale_731_words/

“Jesus

Somehow, and we all laugh as if we really knew him.  We pretend that the few personality traits that he had were different in some way than everyone else’s.  It’s all too scripted for me.  I need to go outside.  I need a cigarette.

I stand out of my steel folding chair and head for the stairs.  Why did I come here?  I only met my grandfather once

“Shit

I lean against the brick façade of the church as I shield the lighter from the wind.  The end of my cigarette begins to glow and I take a drag.  I knew that I could get a minute alone out here.  Nobody smokes anymore.  I probably shouldn’t smoke either

“What will God think?” I hear a woman say.

I look toward the source of the voice and immediately straighten my posture.  After seeing nothing but my dull and pudgy distant relatives for the past two days

“I’m sorry?” I manage to stammer.

“Smoking on the steps of the Lord’s house? Tsk

“And what would that be?” I ask

“Help a stranger in need.  Got another one?” 

“Sure

“Oh shit, clearly meaning it.

“It’s ok.  If it means my sins are wiped clean

She gives a good natured laugh and slips the cigarette out of the package and up to her lips.

“Just this one sin

While her attention is focused on lighting up, has the appearance of someone who is truly beautiful without needing to try.  She is effortlessly thin, and her curly hair blows in the wind but never falls out of place.  There’s not a hint of make-up on her face, yet her skin is flawless.  She would turn heads at the most exclusive Hollywood party.  I can’t begin to imagine the sort of hypnotizing affect she has on the local men and boys in this hell hole.  She lights her cigarette and I bring my eyes back to hers.

“Nobody smokes anymore

I keep finding reasons to continue the habit.  A cigarette break is an entirely underrated advantage for smokers trying to get a girl, this annoyance can become a game changer.  If she smokes, she’ll happily bum a cigarette off of you, and voila!  You’re alone outside, away from her loud friends and away from the other guys that have been staring at her all night.  Or in some instances, you’re alone outside of your grandfather’s funeral and away from your loud Aunt’s and creepy cousins that have been staring at you all day.

“What’s your name?” I ask.

“I don’t know, it’s Flower.”

She slowly exhales and a plume of smoke billows out of her slightly up-turned nose as she continues, Lilac, Iris, Ginger.” 
She can see that I’m confused.

“They were hippies

“So what did you chose?”

“Daisy, I would spend extra time in our garden with them, hoping they would last longer and my parents wouldn’t change my name.” 

“I think you chose well.  It fits you.”

Daisy blushes slightly.

“Are there a lot of hippies in Iowa?” I ask.

“Two or three at a time, “have you ever heard of Stockton’s Oak?” 

I shake my head.

“In the 60’s

I nod to show that I’m following along.

“Well, so they would stop in Webster City for seasonal work in the fields to make enough for the rest of their trip.  They would stay in little camps on the edge of the fields at night and work during the day.  One of the farmers, Edward Stockton had a huge oak tree at the outskirts of his land that his workers would gather under to share food and crafts.  They figured the oak was at least 350 years old.  A migrant worker at the farm even built a little hut in the branches that provided some privacy.”

“Sounds almost like a commune

“You could call it that, Ed Stockton wasn’t very happy about the things that these ‘dirty hippies’ were doing on his property, so one day he came to the edge of his fields with a chainsaw and told his workers that he was taking it down.  By that point, the tree had become a sort of counter-culture landmark, and people traveling through to California made a point to stop and rest by ‘Stockton’s Oak’.  It wasn’t just his workers anymore.  Anyway, can you guess what a group of hippies will do when you tell them you’re cutting down their favorite tree?”  She takes a drag from her cigarette.

I laugh

Daisy exhales, but they didn’t have the resources to get rid of everyone.  They told the police and Ed that they would stay there as long as they had to.  For his part, Ed promised to cut the tree down one way or another, no matter how long it took.”  She made sure to give me a grimace to enhance the story.  “One of the people in that tree was my mother, Ruth.  She left her home in Pennsylvania after her parents had passed away in a car accident.  Her father was a successful business man, and she inherited a lot of money when they died.  My mother didn’t need to make any extra money before she got to San Francisco, and she wasn’t working for Stockton.  She was one of the travelers who had heard of the tree and made a point to stay for a few weeks.”

“What did your grandfather do?”

 “What do any people do?” She answered.  “I think he owned a bunch of appliance stores in the Northeast.  My mother didn’t talk about her parents much.  And back then she didn’t want any of the others at Stockton’s farm to know that she had all of that money. Most days she would pitch in around the farm and would tend the garden that was planted around the oak.  She was planning on going all the way to the West Coast, she came out of the tree and she went to Stockton’s front door.”
I was mesmerized.  I had finished my cigarette minutes ago

“When Stockton came to the door, and she was willing to write a check then and there.  So a few days later, the paperwork was finished and my mother had a farm.  Of course, she didn’t know anything about running that kind of operation.  She just wanted the tree, so soon after, she sold most of the farmland back to one of the locals and kept just enough land for the oak tree, a small house, and a garden.” 

Daisy finished her cigarette now

“After my mother bought the land, but many of the workers made sure to show their appreciation by making clothes for her, or giving her paintings, or even bringing fresh fruits and vegetables.  She did this for many years and lived on her inheritance, but eventually the money started to run out and there were fewer and fewer workers passing through town.”  Daisy turns her head and frowns,  “Sorry.  I’m just going on and on now”

She looked upset.  I could tell that this story was meaningful to her.  

“No

This elicits genuine laughter from Daisy

“My mother decided that it would be alright to ask for just a little bit of money, she was taking reservations and basically running a business.”

“So is it still there?” I ask.

“Of course, even to this day.  Sentimental hippies trek here like it’s their Mecca.  But it’s not as quaint as it used to be.  Over time, my mother was able to charge more and more as her generation got older and more successful.  There’s only one tree, and only one hut in that tree, so I’m sure you can figure it out.  Supply and demand.”

I nod appropriately.

“But now that it’s just me

“Where is this tree?  I’d love to see it.” 

“How long are you in town for?” She questions.

“I’m not sure yet.  Maybe a few days.”  I had planned on leaving as soon as possible

“Well

1372271580.0,1h4hkf,The Worst Time of My Life,arshem,15,3,0,"It was October 8

He was covered in a white film with little blood covering his naked body. The doctor joked when I mentioned the size of my son's package saying, but nothing came. They immediately took him to the warming table and rubbed my son's body with a warmed towel to try and wake him up. His skin was still pale as they wiped away the film that covered him. He had his eyes shut and was barely breathing. I looked back at my wife as she was trying to dodge the nurses that surrounded our son with her field of vision. I smiled at her, trying to give her faith that everything would be okay.

A moment later, not knowing whether to comfort my wife or go with my son. We had two children in the waiting room, wanting to see their little brother.

The doctor was focused on my wife as she told me she was okay and to go find out what I could from the nurses. Hyaline Membrane disease is what they called it. James' lungs were affected and the little hairs that help push out liquids during aspiration fail to do their job. They are slicked down like glass allowing anything to enter. His lungs were sticking together because of this and he was put on a CPAP machine to help keep his lungs inflated.

I was devastated that something like this could happen to my son. The doctor told us that being 4 weeks early wasn't a big deal because the latest ultrasound showed his lungs to be perfectly healthy. Unfortunately ultrasounds cannot show hyaline membrane disease. My wife was bed ridden for most of his stay in the nursery. The day she was allowed to go back was a day and a half later. We knew he would have an extended stay, we still couldn't hold him.

It was while I was letting our family see him that the worst few minutes of my life happened. My wife's aunt came running out of the nursery and into the waiting room where I was talking to other family. ""Something happened. You need to get back there now. He's not breathing.""

Everything stopped in the world at that moment. I ran through the closing nursery hallway doors while bumping into one of them. I staggered towards the nursery windows to see all the blinds shut tight. They were always open

I ran back to the nursery door and pounded on it as hard as I could. A man opened the door a sliver but not enough to see his face. ""Is that baby yours?"" he asked me. I nodded with tears running down my face. My baby was dying and I couldn't see him. The man opened the door wide and I could see tears on his face too. Several nurses were lined around my son's bed. His oxygen tubes and hat was dangling off his makeshift bed. They were working on him as I approached

I wrapped my arms around her as the nurses did their jobs to try and bring him back. My wife explained to me that they were checking his vitals and the monitor showed nothing wrong. It was at the exact moment a nurse was checking his lungs with a stethoscope that she found no heartbeat. We later found that heart monitors are actually several seconds behind

They inflated his lung back by giving him a chest tube and started working back on his heart. He came back to us. He was only without oxygen for a couple of minutes yet it felt like hours. They called for a life line to a hospital that specialized in infants

As they wrapped my son up as best they could to a gurney

I was planning on leaving my wife at the hospital because she had not been released yet, but she kept the pace up. 

We waited for hours for him to become stable. It was nearly midnight and almost everyone was asleep in the NICU waiting room. People lived in the waiting room. We saw suitcases, and people strung all over it. It was our new home for several weeks while our son fought his way back to being healthy.

It took James 3 weeks to be healthy enough to come home. He went from being in the worst possible scenario at Riley (The ECMO station where they run a full heart and lung bypass) to being ready to come home in 3 long exhausting weeks. They were unsure of the outcome when he arrived

After a week and a half there, he was off the breathing tube. A week later, he was able to be fed for the first time by feed tube. A week and a half later, he was in his car seat test, ready to come home.

James is now 2 years old and is a very rambunctious child. He has PDD-NOS, Chiari Malformation, and general muscle weakness in his core, however he is perfect in our eyes. Never would we have imagined going through everything we have but looking back now, I wouldn't trade ANY of it for another child.",,False,t5_2tl2y,True

In 1914

The subsequent fallout set into motion the gargantuan wheels of diplomacy and hostility, out of which seventeen million would never rise again. 

At the end of it all, lost to the follies of mankind.

They called it the Great War, succinctly describing all contemporary sentiments:

Never Again.

In layman terms

In 1939, and the greatest nations of the world girdled themselves for six more years of death and destruction, claiming the lives of seventy million, until the successful nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought a resounding end to the slaughter. 

Learning from their past mistakes

The world sat in bated breath, one of the two superpowers to emerge from World War II, collapsed peacefully, albeit with many issues, the world relaxed and, despite minor hiccups and recurring problems, peace seemed to be here to stay. Mutually Assured Destruction in the form of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry discouraged any escalation in conflict, humanity prospered. 

It was in the year of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the previous war when a game-changing discovery was announced: the technique for personal manipulation of sub-atomic particles within the newly discovered Petrovski-Huang Field and its associated bosons and fermions, as millions declared it a new stage in human evolution. Progress was no longer limited by natural resources and bulky, expensive machinery as a learned and prepared Technician could summon miracles at his or her fingertips, given enough time to harvest energy from the environment, or a good sized external source of power. Thus was declared as the coming of the Singularity, and mankind was set to grasp an even brighter future with this newly developed field of study, in everlasting peace and harmony. 

But peace was never a trait our species was evolved for. 

Five years later, idealist found the ultimate symbol of peace: an anti-nuclear radiation spell. By careful manipulation of the Petrovski-Huang Boson, an elegantly simple method of neutralising uncontrolled nuclear fission and fusion was created, allowing any moderately skilled Technician (a profession which, due to the need for extensive knowledge in physics, was still a minority) to disarm nuclear arsenals from a distance. With its announcement came a fad of defence research, and spells to disable or defend against modern military equipment appeared one after another. War was seen as an impossible endeavour. 

In hindsight

China, itself a highly developed forerunner in both electronics and magitechnological engineer, rather peacefully, removing a thorn on the Communist Party government’s side that had been a source of tension and sticky politics since its rise to power eighty years ago. 

The United States of America, sent the Seventh Fleet at the newly occupied island in an attempt to liberate a strategically important location with vital Magitech human resources. The resulting conflict was chilling to both sides, as three months of bitter fighting within the narrow Taiwanese Strait concluded only with a tenuous ceasefire that cemented the island’s neutrality. Both armies, accustomed to asymmetry in military strengths, reliance on exploitation of enemy weaknesses and superior firepower to obliterate any opposition, found the battle to be a dreadful deadlock. With the help of magic, originally devastating beyond-the-horizon artillery and precision missile strikes were reduced to inaccurate clatter with wide-spectrum sensor jamming Techniques. The unstoppable spear of the United States Armed Force was forced to clash with the unyielding hammer of the People’s Liberation Army in a bloody battle of close-quarter attrition. 

Escalation was much anticipated, Israel and much of the Commonwealth pledged support for the United States, and stood under the flag of the New Alliance, while India, Russia and her ex-Soviet neighbours, with the support of anti-American Middle Eastern nations, joined the Chinese to form the Eurasian Pact. The divided states of Africa and Southern America locked themselves in battle

Twenty years has passed since the Battle for the Taiwanese Strait, while the war in the Pacific had taken an odder geometry, with the Nanjing Military Region and the Seventh Fleet locked in a ceasefire in the seas surrounding Taiwan, now one of very few neutral states, unable to leave the island for fear of losing leverage upon the locale. The remainder of the Eurasian Pact, however, had established a beachhead in Southern California, all the while battling for naval supremacy and supply line security with the shattered but unbroken Third Fleet. The frontline was no longer a two-dimensional stretch on the ground either

Civilian was no longer a valid concept; every human being on the planet lived, producing for the war and researching for the war. 

Those who recorded the events of this conflict quickly recognised the scale of it, they pre-emptively numbered it the First Era of Eternal Conflict, or, to borrow Joseph Goebbels’ Sportpalast Speech made during the last Great War:

*“I ask you: Do you want Total War? If necessary

This is one such story, of irreconcilable despair and unavoidable tragedies, but at the same time an age of heroism and romanticism, of unity and comradeship.

This is one such story.

She awoke to the heavy damp smell of her makeshift bedroom. Even through the metal grate that was her doorway she could tell that the streets had been washed clean. But it’s not like that would do a lot of good, tears, blood and whatever else could be shed from a human body. The girl sat up from her cardboard and old ragged clothed bed and crawled over to a small trench in her room. There was still some fresh water from the street cleansing. She tried to ease her mind of yesterday’s water deposit. Before she knew it, she had already brushed the water along her arms to clean herself and had layered her arms with a brown and sticky liquid. The smell had been beyond nauseating. She was forced to sneak into the upperclass park area to use a fountain to clean up before school that day. Doing so had its own dangers of being arrested so she only washed her arms. Fortunately today the water was clean enough to wash her entire body and it wasn’t very cold either. 

In mid scrub, they never came back up to the surface. The girl dressed herself in her least raggedy of clothes and took note that her jeans were starting to feel a lot looser. When was the last time she had a full meal? Upon exiting her little hovel she pulled on a loose fitting brown coat that had belonged to her mother. This and some other mementos were all that the girl had left of her. 

A little compartment welded to her door held a thick white envelope that looked to have been shoved in hastily in the dark. Slowly and cautiously the girl pulled the envelope out. She worried that a rich person had seen her bathing in the park and may be blackmailing her or possibly inserted a bomb into her mailbox. These things did happen here. The upper class hated seeing her kind above her issued dimension. 

The thick envelope felt heavy and upon opening it, the street assembly would be by soon to clean it up as they always did. The air outside of her hovel wasn’t quite as stale but that was thanks to the cleaning during the darkness. Any other time the girl would leave with her face mask to insure that she wouldn’t have to inhale any unpleasant scents on her way out. Fortunately, today wasn’t so bad. 

She gazed up at the Arti-Sun

“I think I will have thai today”

The streets were crowded as usual and the cheap markets were advertising their daily deals of the third rate food that the upper dimensions didn’t want. She passed by their offers of four day old artificial fish and beef that tastes almost but not quite like the real thing. This girl was on a mission for thai food and there was only one particular place to get it.

Shaped like the handle of a dagger, large black stones like the one he held lining the outside with silver filigree that wound around each to hold them in place.  Unknowably powerful.
He closed his fingers around the stone.  He closed his eyes and slowed his breathing while he called up the words of the spell.  Each of the glyphs flashed in his mind and he muttered them out loud.  
The stone warmed in his hand.  He could feel the energy begin to snake from the surface and through his flesh.  He whispered the words and the stone started to vibrate gently in his grip.  The shift opened in front of him.  He could feel the radiance even before he opened his eyes to watch it form.  The room brightened like the sun bursting through an open window.  A thin blue pane of light hovered in front of him washing in and out of his vision.
Energies from the stone moved like lightning from his hand and sparked against the shift
Rhenarde stood
The magic ran along his skin as he stepped through.  Every nerve in his body tingled as pressed through the peel of light that separated where he was and where he was going.  Instantly, floating in nothingness.  The room around him faded and a forest came into view.  The trees, bushes, and earth were ghostly at first, as if they were lying on top of the room he had been standing in, a second layer on top of the first, but slowly they sharpened.  First the trees darkened, branches, and the lonely candle on a stand in the corner started to fade.  The shift silently dissipated and his bare feet were standing on yellow and red leaves.  
He stood in a forest.  There was a crisp, he thought.   Autumn.  Almost winter.   He dug his bare toes into the cool dampness of the earth.  He didn’t care that he had simply appeared in the forest, that to anyone around, he had just walked through a brilliant blue light the way someone walks through a door.  None of that mattered.  It felt good not be on a boat, good to be on solid ground.  He closed his eyes and relished the sensation while the man he had come to see slowly walked his horse to his side.
The rider stared straight ahead, were lost in the shadow of his cowl.  “How far have you come?”  The voice was soft but stern.
“The captain says we will pass through the strait on the morrow.”
“Good.”  There was no comfort in the reply; the man didn’t even turn his head.  “Why are you here?”
“Simply to report
“You have done so
Rhenarde watched him go.  Velne had been right, equals even, but Velne had always treated him like he was a child - a feeling with which he was all too familiar.  “The day is coming!” He shouted after the elf and his horse’s ass.  “Soon we’ll hold the crown and all of its power.”
“Yes
It was too much.  The words cut through him and he felt the anger stir in his belly.  He suddenly wanted to chase the elf down, doesn’t think I can do it.  
He reached into his pocket
A sigh escaped him and he wondered again about the trust he had placed in the elf.
Over the past months since he had begun the journey toward Trist, but the Magus had assured him that Velne was of little consequence, that what the elf had done or did in the future could not change Rhenarde’s fate.  There was some little comfort in that, but he still wondered about the elf.  Couldn’t help but wonder. 
He pulled the yellow leaf from his toe and held it up to the light of a candle.  It was from a tree he didn’t know, “what is it?”
“If there is nothing else, standing out in the great room waiting for permission to retire.    
“Go find your bed
Since he had been a child Ayhn’s age, imagined wielding the crown’s power.  
The crown and the stones were legend in T’ul, but they had held a special place in his mind.  He had grown up with the legend of Telus and the Dark Temple, the last battle of his grandfather’s grandfather almost three hundred years before his birth.  The way a vine grows around whatever it finds; his life had ground around the stories and legends, they had molded his life to a purpose.  They fueled his faith in a cause everyone else either thought was madness or impossible.  But it is possible.  I will reclaim the throne.  I will raise an army the likes of which Trist has never seen, and I will sit in Mhethyr and wear the crown of my ancestors.",,False,t5_2tl2y,True

&gt;Early afternoon she texted The First 'hey babe I'm gonna drink with my college buddies, but the guilt took the memory wheel and painted him as The Second right there, making that occasion significant.

&gt;Arriving at the bar she sat on the third's table along everybody else. She drank a beer and talked and smiled and drank another beer and another one

&gt;She feels the slight numbness of the booze tender her joints as she walks. Slowly, almost keep the mild cold of the moist in the air from borrowing heat from her skin.

&gt;On the way back to the car, resting her head against his legs. And yet she craves a touch. The third could do nothing: even the wrong touch requires the right moment.

&gt;At the club, as he put his hands on her hip. She suppress the reaction to pull away, as if he had completed the song with the perfect dissonant chord. She keeps on dancing. Now, Smiling. Surely, there was a kink. But it lives too close to the guilt, so she keeps them locked. His hands guide her around, she follows the motions and finishes it with a kiss. He initiates the second and afterwards all of them just melt into a single

&gt;She conceded the many regions of her skin the reminder the moist of a kiss. It was enough to just feel. To let in the warmth of someone who needed her as much as she needed someone. Her giggles only stopped when he kissed her mouth shut. She enclosed him with her legs, leaving her balancing on the edge of conscious and bliss. Eyes went obliquous. Breath stopped. A impulse crawled up her spine, stronger and stronger until it exploded. She screamed and grabbed him with all her strength, melding their bodies as close as it possible. She stares at the ceiling, feeling numb and ecstatic. Nothing was on her mind.

&gt;He kisses her goodbye and leaves. 

&gt;She walked back to bed

&gt;The clock marked 7:44. She got some seconds more of empty thoughts. She got up. She took a shower. She talked trivialities on the internet. The day went by. But, when she understands that imperfection can coexist with beauty. But, for now, all she could do was to keep her mind empty.

Subjectivism and the story of Bob's Cock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Do you regret the eating?

You know about those two guys in Germany? The one that ate the other one. Well never mind that one. What about the guy who was eaten?

Let's call him Bob.

From what I can remember

What I wonder is, the part of him?  Did he think,  this thing was never opposable, never any use outside it's potential, this role I've assigned it in my life? This thing that is only gripped, but can never grasp? Something similarly defeatist?

Was it nihilistic? Did he weep into his shorts in arousal of the idea? Bleed hopefully into the absence of it? So eager to see himself consumed, remembering each inch of encounter and discovery, and burn it away like a love to forget? Leading from that, I wonder if he relinquished the subjectivity of the impoverished eastern european girl  he had a victory lap wank to before the big cook off. Perhaps she was only a background character in the story of his penis, not per se part of the larger canon.

Stories are kind of like Bob's offering, malleable beyond their premise. Only in your imagination are they defeatist, without purpose beyond self pleasure. Only in your imagination are they exciting in the conceit of the destruction and symbolic in their intimacy.

Stories, and, we'd like to think, uniquely a brief member of others. But without you, they'll just sit on the grill. Lacking the subjectivity and drive you've assigned them. As much meat as you are. As much a part of you and your lover as your last meal. Right?

Once Bob released that meaning from himself, without attribute? The same relation as a phantom cock to an eastern european girl without a name? If that's true then all meaning assigned to this part of him in the schema of his life, is now gone. Cooked for dinner and wiped away. It never meant anything anyways.

Or maybe.

Maybe Bob's cock, the imagination of potential,  the realization of purpose and pleasure, and the meaninglessness in its destruction and sameness. Maybe that's what a story is, maybe that's the transformation when you remove a part and offer it. Maybe that's what Bob's cock is now, a prolonged end. Given new imagination by an act. A new purpose through devaluement. Maybe that's what the eastern european girl's picture is, and extension to the end of her body?

But maybe some day Bob's cock will be flowers, longing to fill and be filled with ideas. Maybe she too will separate herself, in an effort to grow in others? Maybe that's the lesson Bob's cock is teaching us?

When a guy eats another guy's sausage, we're all meat, and the meaning we've given ourselves and our parts isn't just in the cut, but in the butcher who understands the animal, who understands both consumption and meaninglessness, but values the intimacy and sanctity of being for a brief moment, a part of something else. Maybe the animals self worth wasn't tied so much to it's shank

Maybe Bob wanted to be his own butcher

But Maybe, and include a small imperial dedication to honor the eastern european girl in some oscar meyer nativity scene. You could have your cock and eat it too, if you're into that.

Maybe what you eat of yourself and offer to others is just an idea - meaning you've placed, but it can be gripped, and vice versa. 

The thing is, imagine them and then amputate them, we could eat each other, and soon be flowers, like Bob's cock. All without mutilation. The meaning isn't in the meat or the knife, the hand or the cock: but in the mind. Maybe that's what a story is, just an extension animated by an idea, or a look exchanged across a room. As much a part of you as your first kiss and your last meal.


I think what Bob didn't need was the barbeque.

“Why did you do that?” Charles asked through his swollen lips. The words came out more anxious and whiny than he had intended. The small woman behind him said nothing
Charles was sure that the crazy bitch was a drug addict and might have been sleeping next to the trashcans. She hadn’t said a word and had hit him twice without a warning. Broke two teeth and split his upper lip. Charles (or Pokey as his friends called him sometimes) could feel the remains of bone and enamel in his mouth and was getting annoyed with his wife. That damn Martha said she needed the trash out because the stupid onions smelled, if you want money, my wallet is in my back pocket” Charles said. “Please Miss, nobody has to die because of...”.  The muzzle flash and the dry pop of a round from a Beretta Nano cut through the darkness and silence of the deserted side road.

The woman stood motionless with the small gun in her left hand, was falling to the left and rolled slowly on its back.

Even in the lacking light of the back road it was easy to see that she had pointed the gun at the back of Charles head

Charles right eye, vomit and air erupted at a swiftly slowing pace. His right eye was pushed out of the socket and was staring at the night sky with chilling and steady indifference.

The emptiness in the woman’s face was replaced by curiousness and she kneeled down next to the steaming and bleeding head of Charles

She pointed the gun down
For a moment she was again motionless
 The woman took a sharp breath that sounded like air being sucked through a wet straw
She pushed and moved the barrel, removed her right hand from the barrel and pressed the trigger again.
With a muffled pop Charles remaining face exploded into a wave of Blood

The woman, she pointed it to her own face. She looked at the bloody barrel and muzzle for a moment with a disconnected intensity, opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue and touched the gun with it. Through the opened mouth, a sound between moan and hiss escaped her, and she closed her eyes.
She shoved the barrel of the gun into her mouth
Behind several windows up in the row of houses
In the new light source of half a dozen windows
The woman began to move the gun like a lover might move his loins while receiving French love.
The gun barrel was thrusting forward and backward
The woman emitted muffled moans.
Soft clicks could have been heard

Voices shouted calls for the police and angry complaints about “keeping it down”. The cacophony of words reflected on the house facades

She seemed unaware of the sounds, she began masturbating frenetically.
More
Additional to the rags of voices

The woman did not pay any attention to the auditory panorama and continued her ritual.
Moans and little screams came from the woman’s mouth

People starred down from the windows
With a hysterical scream that ripped one of her vocal cords
Her loins began thrusting forward

Her body began to twitch in a slowing rhythm and with the final thrust of her loins

She finally burst through the front of the throng and straight into a huge soldier. He was dressed from head to toe in black armour. Her hand touched the cold metal of his lowered rifle and she snatched it away

She shrank back to the line and then spotted what the soldiers were so angry about. In the middle of the street a normal sized man stood between two soldiers. He looked comically tiny next to them but her smile fell when she saw the blood on his face. The soldiers forced him to his knees and a shadow of weary resignation clouded his fierce expression.

She couldn’t understand it; if he was a criminal why weren’t they taking him to prison? People had said the President was coming.

Her heart skipped a beat in delight when she saw the huge black limousine sliding through the parted crowd. She tried to hold back her grin, his towering presence as he gazed lovingly on his grateful subjects, spreading his wisdom and guidance.

He must have been here to grant the criminal forgiveness

“Hey sweetie

“But the President’s here!” Lucy smiled up at her

The woman frowned but disappeared through the sea of people.

The door of the limousine opened and she held her breath. Would he notice her? Her dad was always talking about him.

He stepped out. His shiny shoes

It was the grin of a predator. 

He strode across the filthy concrete towards the kneeling man and the prisoner glared back.

“I have done nothing wrong. All I wanted was democracy!” the man on his knees shouted. “You are a tyrant and the people will rise against you.”

“Rise?” the President sneered

The man looked, but his voice cracked. “He cares nothing for your suffering.”

The President drew his pistol

“No!” she screamed and tried to dart forwards. Her mother grabbed her wrist and dragged her back

She was lifted up and carried away but she still saw the prisoner. He was slumped on the concrete

Now

The soldier was three times her weight

Lucy stamped hard into the side of his knee as he raised his pistol to execute the prisoner. The soldier fell with a roar of pain and she rammed her elbow up into his jaw

The other soldier snapped his rifle sights onto her
There they lowered their head and slowed their pace. The Commoners closed in around them as if they hadn’t even noticed and let them blend in instantly.

“What the hell is wrong with you

“They must have gotten my picture from somewhere...” he said as she led him into the dark chasm between two towers blocks

“They never come here! Now this place is going to be crawling with them. You’re not the only one who has to worry about being recognised, but now it was almost frozen.

He rapidly composed himself. “You and your team of free-love hippies

“This is the thanks I get for saving your life Charlie?” They had argued about this before. 

“You’ve seen what I’ve seen a hundred times

“Because right now all there is to care about is survival

“How dare you? I fight the government, they get their rations and they do it every bloody day without a single thought in their thick heads.”

“You don’t fight, just underground and for a different boss. The only difference is that you’re not on a register.”

He glared. “Why did you save me then? What good did it do you?”

She rolled her eyes. “Not everything I do is planned

The fight was still sinking in

Mike hesitated for a bit. He decided it won't be easy to dissuade Sam

*As long as he gets out of my hair.*

""Alright then.""  
""We'll be leaving in a few.""  
""I still do have to finish a bit of work,"" he said re-assuringly.

A shadow of doubt crossed Sam's face and Mike half expected him to start protesting. However

""Oh, leaving as unceremoniously as he had entered.

Mike heaved a sigh of relief.

*What a pain in the ass.*

The phone rang. He glanced at the screen and didn't recognise the number. He decided to ignore it.

The phone rang again. The same number flashed across the screen.

*Maybe it's something important?*   

""Hello?""  
""Am I speaking to Mr. Mike Smithers?""  
""Uh
""I am calling from the Greenwich County hospital. Your parents were involved in a road accident
""And?"" Mike asked

There was a slight pause.

*Probably gathering his courage*

""They passed away today
""I see.""  
""I'm sorry for your loss.""  
""Me too

The man on the other end waited

*Maybe he expects me to break down into tears?*  

""So, around..."" he said, glancing at his watch. ""...seven in the morning..?""

He hung up the phone

*At least I don't have to go to the pub now.*

He hastily scribbled down an application for leave and handed it to the manager who was most understanding

Outside

*Pat pat pat.*

*The rain feels cleansing.*

He smiled to himself

*Who am I kidding? It's the same every time. Cold


He hailed a cab. He fell into an uneasy sleep. Vague nightmares haunted him.
The cab jolted to a stop

*Pat Pat Pat.*

The first thing he did when he reached home was undress himself. Unfastening each button was a struggle. He fumbled and floundered. By the time he was done

*I still have to book the tickets. Did the news come today...or was it yesterday?*

It didn't matter.

He just lay there

*How long have I been here? Did I doze off?*

He sighed and forced himself to get up. He wiped off the foggy mirror. A stranger stared back at him. A gaunt faced stranger with sunken eyes. Well developed smiles lines suggested of a man that had once laughed freely but for now

*The perfect mask.*

An involuntary sigh escaped his lips.

*It has been so long. Is there even a real person behind this mask?*

He wondered

*Perhaps

*How?*  

*Oh, taunting him.

He nodded to himself. He knew what he had to do. He had known it for the longest time.

He reached into the drawer and pulled out the gun.

*Now that there is nothing stopping me...*

He ran his fingers along the smooth

*Finally.*

He cocked the gun and pulled the trigger.

The man they called Bearkiller said something in a deep

“My Knight, “Keeps fairer law here than Lord Halloway. By right of force, I say begone, boy.” He giggled then and coughed so hideously that brown flecked snot and drool flung from the frog lord and Paul had to turn away to avoid being struck by it. Anger began to override his fear, yet the sight of Bearkiller stayed his sword hand. He swallowed and glanced to his uncle, but the older man simply stared at the fat lord with disdain. *If I back down now I am a coward and father will disown me. The Nobility has no need of cowards.*

He shifted his gaze away from Bearkiller to Lord Mossfield and back again. The Bearkiller was smiling at him

“Joss, sword unsheathed and laid across his pommel. “You and Bearkiller push these trespassers off our land.”

Paul hesitated, swords drew and challenges were yelled. He found his own sword in his hand, his shield hefted to guard his right side. Rock pranced, shaking his head, ready to fight.

Bearkiller was yelling something but a buzz of noise erupted all around him. Men were calling to him. Lord Mossfield was laughing. Be brave

His sword took the fat lord in the face, a high pitched wail that was almost a sob. Bearkiller roared and reached for him but Rock reared, causing the Bearkiller to stumble and sprawl in the dirt. In that same instant, Paul lost his seat and tumbled off Rock’s back.

“Paulin!” his uncle’s voice called out and Paul saw his hand reach down for him. An arrow took his uncle in the throat and when Loukas opened his mouth to speak, Rock reared and kicked, sending Mossfield men sprawling, chests and faces caved in. Paul felt his fingers brush something hard and cold—his sword he realized—and he picked it up. Standing, Paul tried to climb back onto Rock but the battle forced him away and he fell back into the dirt.

All around him chaos was erupting. Mossfield and Halloway men clashed and the Thunder Company charged in, swung at him again. This time, Paul managed to bring his shield up. As the blade rang off the wood, he felt a warmth spread down his leg. Fear gripped him so tightly that he couldn’t move, only stare down at his bloodless legs.

His heart had emptied and so had his bladder.

The man came at him again but a horse came between them. Atop his brown charger

Something grabbed his shield and yanked him roughly to his feet. When he looked up,” the giant of a man said. “Make your death and drink your blood, like the Witch Queen.” Then he dipped back his head and roared with laughter.

Paul stepped back

The shield exploded from the impact, weak boy!” the Bearkiller shouted.

Instead

He heard the Bearkiller calling his name but he didn’t look back. He ran between horses rearing

After

He crawled beneath the thickest bush he could find. He was so tired that it took all that was left of his energy to curl up beneath it. The sun was shining through the canopy above. He heard birds chirping. A bloody spring,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_1hjn1s

So, in your opinion? Should I assume that my reader has a basic understanding of root words and exclude something like Malcolm in this case?

Anyway, take him from his house and dump him in the streets where he is found and taken to a hospital. There he meets a detective (who may be an alternate POV through out the story) who takes on finding who did this to him. (Grady) is soon given a clean bill of health and released from the hospital and is taken home. Soon after he realizes that something in his mind has changed and he begins to have rage problems and urges to kill. So he does and after his first kill her is tortured with guilt but his urge was relieved. As the urges return over and over again he tries to curve the cravings with other things like prostitutes, hard drugs, alcohol, and eventually rape but none of them completely satisfy the urges so he always resorts to killing. After his third or fourth kill he decides that he will fight the urges that are building up inside of him and direct his anger towards those who did this to him and is on a mission to find them before the detective. 

Here's where my problem comes in: How does (Grady) find out who these guys are? I had an idea that one of them would either be constantly handling a sobriety coin while at the house or wearing one around his neck. And so (Grady) would go and sit in on AA and durg addiction meetings until he finds him. But the problem with that is that 1. The guys will be wearing masks so he'll never see there faces so he won't know what they look like 2. I plan on the setting being a big city and I imagine that there are possibly hundreds if not thousands of AA and drug recovery meetings so it's not really practical for him to go to all of these meetings.

This wouldn’t be the first time cold metal would pierce my skin. The smell of copper would soon fill the room and I would become light-headed. It was what I wanted. I wanted the escape - to journey closer to the edge. I wasn’t sure yet if I wanted to cross over but each time I went closer the better I felt when I came back. Such a strange thing life is. Here on the edge I get just a taste of what else is out there. 
	
I tried explaining it to my psychologist but he just shook his head and sent me to a physiatrist. The bevy of pills that man tried to dose me with was ridiculous.  As he was listing the issues I had to my mother I couldn’t help but sing it Greased Lighting style.  Why this girl is automatic, she’s Schizophrenic. 
	
Right. I was the one who was schizophrenic. It wasn’t my fault he wasn’t able to see what I could. If a physicist proved that there were other dimensions surrounding us

I met a man with a scar that ran from his left temple across his face to his right side of his chin. My mother would have ran from him. I couldn’t help but approach him and wonder why he was staring at the wall so intently. His weak smile made my heart pause for a moment. He couldn’t grab ahold of the flaking wall and his spirit faded with each motion he made. Help me
	
“What’s your name?” My voice sounded almost musical in this dimension.
	
“Francis Grace.”  It wasn’t hard to see that speaking caused such great pain to the man.  “Can you bring it to my mother?”
	
“Where does she live?” I wasn’t going to ask him what it was
	
There was nothing worse than waking up to the bright lights of the emergency room.  Maybe if the people on this side understood how confusing it is to find your way back home they would keep it dark. Bright lights belong to the other side while darkness belongs here. I’m not sure how many times I have tried to explain it to the nurse but they always just shake their heads and walk away. They didn’t understand that they were representing the darkness with their actions.
	
“Ms. Carry please be still.” Nurse Janice had no patience today for me. She’s seen me dozen times since I was thirteen. 
	
“No time for this nonsense

This couldn’t happen today. I had to help Mr. Grace. He needed his soul to rest and I knew where the wall was. I had seen it before and it wasn’t too far from here. But before I could throw my limp legs over the edge of the bed an orderly had me pinned down while Janice pumped me with a new cocktail to help me rest. 
	
My foot itched from the blanket covering it. Whatever they filled me with wasn’t doing the trick. Instead of drifting off to a lovely catatonic state my skin felt as if thousands of ant were slowly creeping across it. I knew if I were to struggle in my restraints they would come back
	
The halls of the hospital were quiet. It must have been late, I was just crossing over. Besides I’ve met death that several times while I was quite alive. 
	
The room suddenly went cold. I looked around for what spirit had come to visit. I couldn’t see anyone

Faster than I should have moved I threw my hoodie on over my head and slipped into the jeans my mom had brought me. The room spun in a lopsided circle but I wasn’t going to let that stop me from finding that wall. 

The wind whipped around my face. I didn’t have any money to call a cab

The sun broke through the fog as I entered the overgrown church yard. A few birds chirped from the tree just outside the gate. The wildflowers were taking over the walkway which shimmered in the morning dew. Each barefooted step I made was carefully placed not to step on a single one. The flowers looked as though they breathed sigh of relief as I passed them unharmed. Francis Grace stood at the doorway waiting for me. The pain on his face was no longer there. 

“Thank you

The wooden pews had been beaten by years of being exposed to rain and snow. There were still bibles scattered along the floor and above the altar was a beautiful stained glass dove. It was so peaceful to look at. The morning sun made it glow so bright that it crept into my bones washing away the cold that gripped me so tightly. 

Mr. Grace paced along the west wall. I didn’t know what I was looking for but he let me know this was the wall. A small crack in the plaster made it easy for my fingers to grip and pull it apart. For how damaged the wall looked

The sun reached high noon before I pulled enough plaster away. Dust from the wall covered my body and made it hard to see. Not to mention I was on my tiptoes peering into a dark hole in the wall. A rickety chair was nearby. I grabbed it and prayed it would support me. In two unsure steps I was up peering into the dusty space. Off to the left I saw something and twisted my arm in ignoring the sharp pain tearing at my wrist and there it was. A small blue box. 

“You found it.” Francis’ eyes started to water.

It was strange to watch a man with such a terrifying face, but I wasn’t on his side. I couldn’t touch him. 

“Where does she live?” I asked

Francis grabbed hold of my hand and we were no longer in the church. An unexpected serenity came over as he held onto me tightly. I always thought I would be scared if one of the ghosts finally touched me

“Mrs. Grace?” I inquired.

She jumped and accidentally snipped one of her fingers. “Yes?”

I held out the blue box. “Your son wanted you to have this.”

1349353216.0,10xker,The Siren Song,IncreasingEntropy,11,1,7,"**I wrote this a few years ago as part of a high school creative writing class. It's nothing stellar


The boat was doomed the moment the Siren parted his lips. Like a child hypnotized by promises of sweets, the craft left its harbor home, too quickly to stop for a map. Out on the sea, his seductive song was everywhere; crashing through waves, radiating from the sun, and soaking through the air. His delicious music pulled the boat further and further as the continent the boat once loved faded into the distance, too fast for any captain. Islands disappeared, until even the air and water had been replaced by the harmony. After minutes that stretched like years, and it knew the Siren wanted it there close to him

Maybe if the boat had seen the rocks lurking around the sand bar, the jumble of wood cut through the water to race to the Siren’s side. A heartbeat from landfall, the water cut back. Rocks bashed the bow, wrenching nail from plank while boards buckled, contorted, and gnashed at each other. Timber shrieked as it tore apart and splintered into the sea beneath it. Water, heated from the friction, filling the air with its metallic stench. The Siren’s song still permeated the air, accidentally enticing poor vessel forward. Destroyed by its own naivety


Even after all this, in the utter silence, I see everything clearly. I see that I could block my ears, pry the rock from my pierced sides, gather my frame, rebuild my mast and drain the saltwater from my belly. I could turn back, sail in blurred loops until I fumbled my way home, but then the song continues and I am entranced once more. For eternity, and hope that his eyes turn on me. Until then

1346445880.0,z5k5l,[critique][sci-fi][1560 words] Sat down and wrote for 45 minutes after an image popped in to my head. What do you think?,thelakesouth,11,2,7,"
Derek Yu pulled his hood over his head in an attempt to guard against the chill coming in off the lake. It was late September, he was sure the coming one would be no different. 
	He stepped off the street, in English. Almost all of the signs down in chinatown were in Mandarin, but this one was close to the neighborhood's edge, and most of its customers were lost Americans or local tourists who only spoke english. The resturant had a low ceiling, with painfully bright flourescent lights bolted in to it. The tile floor was cracked and worn, and most of the tables had their chairs set on top of them for the night. It was three in the morning, and Derek had felt a gnawing hunger growing in his stomach for the last few hours on the bus. 
	There was only one other customer in the place, in fact he had forgotten most of it except for a few scarce phrases and greetings. The employee noticed his broken pronounciation and quickly switched to English with a nearly flawless midwestern accent.
	""What are you having tonight

""Is your Lo Mein really as good as the sign says?""

""It's the best in Chicago"" The employee said. He sounded like he didn't believe it.

""Sounds good enough for me. What's there to drink here?""

""Water

Derek stopped him before he could finish his list.

""I'll just have water

""Lo Mein and water"" The employee sketched the order down on a notepad

Yu chose a seat by the window and stared out in to the street. A dog barked somewhere off in the distance, the man nodded back. He bent down to his backpack, which was seated under the table, and took out a brochure that he had received a week earlier. Choosing your path, a guide to your life with mechanical augmentations. Yu reached down and felt the empty space where his left arm used to be. It still bothered him, knowing that a piece of his body was never coming back. 
	50, inside my department and checking the machines by six-thirty. Everything goes according to plan until ten fifty-seven. Arm gets caught in a corn thresher, black out, wake up the next day. Arm's gone, doctors are telling me I'm lucky to be alive but I'll never get the arm back.
	He couldn't believe that he had let his guard down that much. The higher-ups always told horror stories like that to the newbies to scare them straight, and promised that the company would pay for any augmentation that was necessary to get him working again. That sounded great, until they handed him a list of doctors approved by the company's insurance. It was a very short list.
	Stephen Goulianos-Chicago
That was it. No approved doctors in Iowa, or he would live the rest of his life as an amputee. It was a six hour bus ride, and he would have to stay at least a week for the physical therapy after the operation. It was a pain, but he would be unable to continue working unless he took the time off.
	By the time his food got to his table, and wolfed down the noodles as soon as the waiter left the table. Once he had eaten his fill, he started flipping through the brochure. There was the standard preamble about how it was such a ""hard decision"" and the psychological affects affects of augmentation couldn't be ignored. Yu didn't really care as long as he could work, and turned to the last section that listed the different models of mechanical arms he could choose from. They all looked pretty similar except for the colors they came in. Some were more specialized for certain work like construction or IT, some didn't even look like regular arms, others had the exact flesh tone of the real thing. Yu decided then and there that he didn't want his arm to look like the one he lost. If he was going to be part machine from now on, he was going to be proud of it. He picked the standard civilian model in black and made up his mind to tell Goulianos he wanted that one. 
	Having made up his mind and satisfied his hunger, and headed in the direction of the hotel he was staying in for the night. It was situated on the corner of West 24th Place and South Princeton Avenue, overlooking Sun-Yet-Sen park. It was a recent development, constructed in 2023 to bring in more revenue to that part of the city. Chinatown was notorious for its lack of sleeping arrangements for people who were just passing through, and the city council wanted to improve the neighborhood's appeal to tourists. 
	The contract had been given to the Wudi Construction Company after a fierce bidding war. Construction had been quick and a few regulations had been overlooked by the city government to ensure the process went smoothly. A few corners cut here, and certainly nothing that the mayor needed to know about.
	Yu walked a few blocks south to West 24th Place, not many windows or outside features to catch people's eyes as they strolled past. It was build with function, not form, in mind, much like the rest of the city. Yu's back ached from his six hour bus ride, and the walk had done little to alleviate the pain. He needed to lie down and rest up, he had an eight o'clock appointment with Goulianos tomorrow.
	He stepped inside and the buidling took on a radically different feeling. The hotel was hollow, he could see the outlines of people inside their tiny, one-man rooms. People watching movies on their computers, people reading, people sleeping. Privacy was not a concern here, there was none to be found. If you wanted a cheap place to stay for a while, you came here.
The atrium had a water feature in the center, and he seriously contemplated staying up the whole night. Three hours of sleep didn't seem worth it to him, but it was better than nothing. He went under an arch and down a hallway filled with washing machines and dryers. The stairs led him up to his room on the fifth floor. Each floor had fifty rooms in it, and they were all usually full. He climbed in to his bed, feeling the walls close in around him. Some people hated these hotels, but Yu found the room to be comforting, cocoon-like. He took off his hat, and looked out the window next to his head. He could see the rising wall of hotel patrons across the atrium

A good friend once asked me. What is it like? What is it like to be me? ""Humor me

I thought to myself for a time. This was a good friend of mine, no; can she understand the picture I would paint for her?

""Well, possibly a steel winter night. You walk out to your front yard. You see you neighbor, you chat them up. Normal small talk. No real meaning to it, just trying to be a good person. Good people are friendly. He is telling you about his new promotion when you hear them. They come from the distance, from a new place beyond the horizon. You first hear their song, a wail as beautiful as it is sullen. You walk out to your fence, partly due to curiosity, when observe us talk to one another. Your neighbor says goodbye

You smell your food inside, but you don't move. You know what you want to do, but you cannot. You want to run from the song, run to the arms of your loved ones waiting inside. Whisper sweet nothings into your Lovers ear; perhaps even get a little frisky before you leave for work. That always make Monday a lot more bearable. 

But the song. That beautiful, satisfy that yearning which screams on the tip of your tongue. And then you remember, the Sirens. Alas, they have come for you again! What are you supposed to do next, if you could only remember what Odysseus did next. Was it moss in the ears, perhaps beeswax? Wait, what story is this again?… I think I was the Odyssey. And besides, your a carpenter dammit! That's the one thing that will always keep you grounded. 

A man and his chosen craft. Your identity! You are a hard-working, with no real purpose behind your actions. You swing. 

They rip through the sky the same way your son tears apart the newspaper for his confetti. They leave behind them a trail of heavy, drawn to the succulent beauty hue. This is surely God which you witness. It utterly destroys you; still you scream for more. You helplessly grasp for the sky, yet the endless Tahoe would not quench this thirst.

And then it hits you

Red mist gushes from the cuts in the sky. Surely you were never meant to see this much. It covers everything that you have ever known. Your Love, your essence. But that too, the red consumes. It overtakes you, and you remember another familiar hue. A black more absolute than the edge of infinity. You hear one more cry from your son. Then silence.

One of my fondest childhood memories comes from first grade. I’m not sure why I remember this event so clearly

I was unhappy because my friend Ryan was not in class. I did not have many friends as a first grader, as was the norm for children without playmates. 

When I was a child I used to get extremely nauseous in anticipation of something unsatisfactory to my psyche: the first day of school, scared that it might cause permanent damage to my insides should my stomach explode and leak out inside of me.

I was an extremely paranoid and frightened child. 

As the teacher prattled on about this and that, I tried to focus on not running to the bathroom to purge myself of this horrid feeling. Each time I told myself “recess alone isn’t so bad” all I would do is connect that to my stomach, which would again focus me on my predicament. I really wish we were learning something new. That always took my mind off things.

I noticed the teacher began looking over towards the window seats while slowly stopping her stream of information. Our classroom was set up in six groups of four desks

Outside on the blacktop adjacent our room was a humpback whale. It floated on air, slowly swaying side to side. It vocalized a few times; that throbbing, high-pitched yet incredibly deep moan which echoes through your chest. The children were amazed, as was the teacher. We could only sit and stare at this majestic mammal manifesting itself on our humble elementary school’s first grade playground. I was very upset that Ryan was not here to see this. I stood up to move towards the windows.

And that is when I woke up. Because, 10 miles from shore, FLOATING, on a school playground. 

What you’ve just read is what this book is all about; it is a collection of my dreams

&gt; Yuri checked his watch, I’m going to shove you out of an airlock. I‘m not joking this time, I‘ll do it.”

&gt; No answer. Yuri ripped the blankets forcefully back from the circular bed. A tangle of arms and legs and surprised faces lay underneath. There was a shrill scream.

&gt; Yuri threw the covers quickly back on the bed

&gt; “Various naked people

&gt; A giggle from under the blankets.

&gt; “…Anyway, I’m going to recommend that you be transferred, preferably somewhere horrible.”

&gt; Yuri walked out of the quarter and leaned on the wall outside of Darl’s door

&gt; After a moment

&gt; Yuri started to move for the door when it opened again. A young man with strong features and olive skin jerked back with wide eyes in the doorway. Yuri raised his eyebrows

&gt; Yuri walked back into the quarter. Darl was in the bathroom

&gt; “You’re incorrigible.”

&gt; Darl walked back in when he was done and began to throw on his clothes. “It wouldn’t hurt you to lay some pipe every now and again.”

&gt; “Not very discriminating with regards to the plumbing

&gt; “What can I say? They’re a cute couple.”

&gt; “Ugh

&gt; Darl walked past Yuri in his pajamas and out the door. Yuri followed him.

&gt; “You know

&gt; Darl threw his hands up. “What does it matter?” He jumped up as he walked to slap at a hanging light. “We’re on the Big Voice

&gt; “It’s the principle of the thing.”

&gt; “I still think if you got a little ‘casual’ once in awhile you wouldn’t continually be on the edge of a nervous breakdown all the time.”

&gt; “Can you blame me for taking my job seriously, the biosphere would be destroyed–”

&gt; “Yeah, it’s just a little rain. It’s just a little sun. Lighten up.”

&gt; They walked into the climate cabin. They sat down at the console and pulled up the analysis screens. Humidity, oxygen levels, carbon dioxide, light spectrums.

&gt; Darl put on the headphones while Yuri worked the switchboard.

&gt; “Should have got numbers for those two

&gt; “Seriously, disgusted. “You’re going live in eight, seven, six, five, four, three, one.”

&gt; “Good morning Icarus! This is Darl Rock with your friendly neighborhood Climate Control, so get those hydro collection systems ready and bring in the laundry. As a complement to the First Crop, we will be scheduling a series of gentle storm systems this week to aid germination in the Agricultural Station. Per standard operating procedure, we will also provide precipitation alerts prior to all climate activation. Thanks, and as always, enjoy that wet weather!”

&gt; Yuri took a slug of coffee from the side of the console and switched off the Big Voice.

&gt; “And that’s a wrap. I can’t believe you actually get paid to do that.”

&gt; “It’s the silky smooth vocals

&gt; “A chimp could do your job.”

&gt; “Aw

&gt; Yuri accessed the climate control panel

&gt; “Beginning precipitation sequence for the *U.S.S. Icarus,” Yuri said, his words clipped and professional.

&gt; “We’ve got a go for Rainmaker Five

&gt; “Affirmative. Proceed.”

&gt; “Countdown sequence in ten, seven, six, five, four, three, two

Paul landed on his arm and he had the breath driven from him. He coughed and sputtered, drive away that pain in order to form enough coherent thought to answer her. “Paulin,” he begain. “Son of Ga—“

A terrible wrenching pain overtook him as she pulled a large piece of wood from his bicep with a sharp, anything but that pain. “Your arm is bent up,” she said coolly and then the pain was nothing to the sickening sensation of his shoulder popping back into proper alignment. He retched where he lay and had to pull his head back in order to not swallow it again. His head swam and the world went white with pain. Hoping he would slip into unconsciousness, he rolled onto his back and closed his eyes.

A slap pulled him free from any hope of blissful unconsciousness. The girl’s face was looking down at him and her hands were pulling at his collar and then looping an arm beneath his shoulder. She grunted and he felt himself being pushed up but only for a moment. She let him drop bodily back to the ground. The pain returned and he groaned

“My what?” he asked,” he bit back a scream of pain as she lifted him by the shoulder to his knees. “Have to get someone to help me lift it off.”

The girl paused here, then moaned as he stumbled and his shoulder had weight suddenly pushed upon it. He glanced at her and she seemed to be smiling. Her front teeth were too large for the rest of her mouth. Paul thought she looked like a rabbit. “What are you grinning at?”

Her smile faded but her mirth did not. The corners of her mouth seemed to tighten, which set off more pain in his arm. She turned to look at him now. Her eyes were dark brown. It reminded him of mud which in turn reminded him of swamps and then the Mossfields and Bearkiller. He shivered. “Never met a bloody noble who was rescued by a girl… nor one who soiled himself rotten.”

He turned bright red. With every step he realized she was right. His underclothes were damp and rotten. Fear had made his bowels loose their contents. *Just like I had let loose my honor. They will call me the Thegn of Shit if they call me a Thegn at all.*

“Battle

“You look no more than a boy in silly armor. Are you sure you’re a nobleman? Where is your shield or sword? All noble fighters have those.”

He bared his teeth and clenched his fists, he told himself bitterly. *Like a coward*. “I lost it in the confusion.”

The girl only nodded and then grunted as he stumbled, he was surprised to find that she was nearly as tall as he was. Her shoulders were narrow, a woman’s frame for sure, but there was a wiry strength to her. Her arms beneath his felt like taut ropes and she never tired as they trudged on through the edge of the forest. In the distance he saw smoke from a chimney. “Where are we going?” he asked her, realizing she had never given him a proper answer the first time.

“My grandmother’s

“I need to get back to my men, silly body was crushing them.” She offered another amused smile. “Do noblemen ask maidens for their names?”

“They ask noblewomen for their names, he wanted the words back. Yet the harshness of his voice must have been harsher to his ears than hers, as her smile broadened. “Mayhaps I’m a noble lady in disguise?

There she is. Your little girl is sitting behind the piano quietly developing the new tune she’s been working on. Her feet dangle off the bench as she plays; she’s not quite big enough to reach the peddles yet. Each time she makes a mistake, smiling. 

You’ve finally found the perfect spot for the piano. It’s rested in the corner right next to the bay of windows looking out to your expansive field. The way the sunlight is bent through the arches casts a sort of spotlight on her little body. This is her stage. 

The piano is an antique. It was recently left to you by one of your neighbors; the old man down the row whose palsied hands taught your daughter to play. It wasn’t a bequeathal or any part of his will, the golden fields surrounding it your livelihood, to leave would be to abandon everything you’ve worked so tirelessly for; to surrender. 

Your girl’s song weaves in and out of your awareness as you pace around your home

Your daughter serves as a welcome distraction from it all. Each tender keystroke wears down your mounting anxiety. You begin to feel at ease in your own home again. It’s been so long since you’ve been able to feel safe. Long

Whatever obstinacy your neighbors have accused you of is clearly false. Everything in your home is perfect. Nothing could disrupt this. The ringing out of the piano’s melody acts as a signifier of the innocence and security that envelopes your home. Everything is going to be fine.

Two riders carved their way through a dirt road

They traded turns leading each other in a game of cat and mouse and feigned dodging in front of the other in playful attempts at running the other into the surrounding field. They wore the standard green uniforms synonymous with battle but with little attention paid to standards of military fastidiousness; open buttons and loose chin straps combined with untucked shirts and scuffed boots. 

The pairs’ faces were ensconced in a layer of dirt that covered their skin wholly. Every laugh, uncovering a treasure of white untarnished by the dust of the atmosphere. 

Along their careless cruise the rider’s took in the sights of the country side that they were passing through. Most of the houses appeared to be abandoned as this had not long ago been the scene of a significant battle. They were told to be wary of any traps that may have been left behind by retreating axis soldiers; mainly landmines. As of yet they hadn’t seen any suspicious plots in the ground but one got the sense that they would be easily dodged as the riders displayed a fine grace while they tore through the road.

Remnants of war were strewn about the landscape – empty craters

Up ahead one of the riders noticed a piano lying on the side of the road. Its varnished exterior scratched and scuffed through the rough treatment it endured in being dragged out of a house. The rider imagined its previous life and ruminated on what hands might have played it before its current fate. Keys were missing and the exterior was cracked and broken. It even appeared as if some flora were beginning to claim it. 

The road ahead began to narrow as the riders were about to enter a wood-lined section of the passage. Massive trees bordered this section of the road and their touching leaves created a formal entry point resembling an archway. Just as they were coming upon the shadowed tunnel side-by-side one of the riders ripped ahead of the other. At first the trailing party began to laugh as had been the ritual for the duration of the foregoing but now he noticed something peculiar.

Between the very first two trees that were on either side of the road was a bird. The bird was not perched on either of the trees nor were its wings in motion. It looked as if it was levitating in the direct center of the pass. With its chest puffed out and head twitching, the rider understood what it was and called out to his leader but his voice was dwarfed by the growl of the engines. It was too late anyway.

The leading rider’s bike and torso remained in motion through the ravine but his head and helmet remained behind. When the trailer came upon his partner

He pulled up slowly to where the bird had been. The sunlight glinted off something metallic and the weapon that ended his friend made itself visible. Strung between the two trees was a thin and steady length of piano wire.

1373771550.0,1i97k3,[Feedback] Arson Night (Part 1),CadeStaker,10,3,7,"The story is fiction, which would be used in conjunction with the short story to instill a sense of it being very real. This is my first attempt at any serious writing



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lives we lead are either by choice or by fate; and a night such as this one, where the loneliest person could not be found, nor heard. I rushed outside to see the fire for myself before calling the fire department. To my surprise, it was less than I expected; it took out two twenty foot trees, along with the metal fencing behind them. For reasons unknown to me, it was somehow dying out. Within the minute, it was extinguished; I couldn’t believe my own eyes. I am not a man of science, and I even looked around to assess that I was in fact
     

With the flames gone, I heard footsteps to my side – behind the garage, which had a small fortified pond blocking myself from the area. I had come outside in the middle of the night without thinking, witnessed a fire, and now heard footsteps near me; I should have been terrified. But it was at that precise time, that I became fueled by adrenaline. I don’t know how well-wired my human body is, but this was likely the absolute worst time to decide to ‘fight’ in a ‘flight or fight’ situation. I ran towards the pond, and peered behind my garage. Nothing there
     

 “Am I just becoming paranoid?” I asked myself out loud, in fact. One of the figures was noticeably larger than the other; both were heavily draped in black. Perhaps the darkness of the night had shrouded them from my sight, it was certainly plausible. But before I could understand the situation, the shorter figure leapt the short wooden fence, while the larger figure began pacing towards me with its arm reaching out to me.
    

 “I already called the police!” I shouted, the large figure that was previously approaching me, stopped. I could feel its eyes sizing me up, and I concluded in my head that my chances were not good. I immediately began running back to my house, which was maybe 100 feet away. The figure did not budge, and eventually vanished into the night as I slammed through my living room door. 
     

 I went to dial 911, “It wasn’t this dark when I woke up.” I tried to resist my paranoia and edge further into the house, but I was paralyzed by fear when I saw what was in front of me; my landline telephone, on the ground, and in the middle of the bedroom. Several rooms away from where it normally was. It was so innocently sitting there, begging me to pick it up. But if you have ever felt fear of this extent, you know what I mean when I talk about not being able to move a single muscle. 


 “I called the cops, I neglected to notice the battery on my pillow. But all of my attempts at making sense of what was going on stopped completely, as I felt the sharp and cold steel press against my neck. I was trapped; both physically, and within my own mind.

1373616711.0,1i53xo,[Feedback] Could use some help with my flow. 801 words.,Dalven,9,2,9,"Hey guys. I'm very new to writing and this is one of the first things I've ever given a legitimate stab at. Reading it over though

-------------------
There was no moon. Fog and darkness weighed down on the village of Cinderly. It stilled the air and froze the place in time, their bounty long rotted away,  and the cobblestone streets that linked it all together were wet with the early morning dew. Most of the windows were broken, and the ones that remained were coated with a melting frost that made them weep.
	
The manor house at the southern end of the village was one of the only homes left furnished. The Lord and Lady's bedchamber on the second floor remained as lavish as it looked on the last night it was slept in. A giant four poster bed dominated the right side of the room. The sheets on it were covered in a thin layer of dust but under it, allowing the cold air into the bedchamber and chilling the bones of the woman waiting by it. She sat in a guest chair, its red embroidery graying from years of abandon. There was no wind, but the frigid air forced her to keep her cloak tightly wrapped around her. She kept her hood down.
	
Her thoughts were in two places at all times. One half kept reminding her of the eeriness of where she sat. It kept her fully alert. Always reminding her that at any moment,  the Lady would be looking down at her through tear clouded eyes. Her white robes heavy with blood. Then she would open her mouth and scream the Widow’s Wail. The one she screamed four years ago when the soldiers broke down her door and thrust her Lord husband’s head into her arms. The one she screamed after they drove their swords through her belly as she looked into her lover’s dead eyes. The one that woke the capital, and is still spoken of today.
	
The other half tried for naught to make her forget that and keep herself focused on the reason she was here. She had to keep watch out the window if she didn’t want to miss the signal. From here, when the sewer spit a lit torch aside from its usual waste, she would know it was time to move. For that’s when she would meet with the nameless man she was told would come with the package for her. Bandages, salves, and ointments for her people back home.
	
Her eyes strayed upward to a small ember dancing in the sky.  Beneath it, stopping now and then to  peer over the edge. A few dozen yards ahead on his path, there was a lit brazier where three other soldiers sat talking and resting their legs. Every now and then, one would laugh or cough loud enough that she would hear him here. They would be the only sounds in the otherwise silent night. None of them ever looked in the direction of the village, as she expected. The Widow’s Wail was now more of a tale used by people in the capital to scare their children into behaving, but most soldier’s knew It all to differently. None of the men who heard it first hand were alive today. Of the six who came into Lady Yane’s bedchamber that night, one was found hanging in his home shortly after, and the other four simply walked off the capital walls together one night. The ones who weren’t found broken beyond recognition the next day still lay with their eyes open

""I surely will."" he said

Bob once told me he would have loved to have gone overseas to Italy and backpack up and down the country. I think he was 48 when he told me this

I always feel an uneasiness when summer comes along. I know its been said before but summer really is the unfulfilled promise of spring.

I was told not to come into work so i slept in. I had worked for Securities Trading for three years now. My job was to encourage banks to sell loans. After being there for six months

The sun was in my eyes as I looked out the window. I yawned and stretched. I got a glass of water from the kitchen and went back to bed.

It was dark when I woke up. I was hungry. My fridge was empty. There was this very nice deli on 42nd that I liked. I was so hungry I changed into my running clothes so I wouldn't look so crazy when I ran there.

My legs got tight pretty quick and I didn't feel like running anymore so I stopped. I wandered around a bit eventually making my way there. I got a turkey sandwich with swiss on rye. It was very good.

After my mom lost her job

Matt was drunk. Grant was drunk. They all were drunk.

""God

""Yeah man. Looks like it

""You're not drunk

""Not really

""You think you are better than the rest of us. Can't get drunk with us.""

""No


Jake stared at me for a second. Then laughed in my face.

""Smoke break

The experience of living with roommates was so bad and I was so broke that I felt that I had no choice but to move back home. It was easier living at home. Mom spent most of the day in bed so I just kept really quiet all the time and everything was fine.

I can't remember how I met Helen but it was sometime after I had moved back home. At first I thought Matt had put her up to it as a joke. After I called her out on it though


My phone rang. It was Helen. ""Hello


""Hey.""

""Oh


""Nothing. What are you doing tonight?""


""Oh. Nothing. Dinner. Maybe a movie. Wanna come?""
""Umm.""
""You don't have to if you don't want to.""
""Yeah. I'll come.""
""Yep.""

I was going to school and I was happy for that

""How was you day?"" she would ask.
""Oh fine. Just like yesterday I suppose. I would respond

My routine went something like this---Get up. Eat. Watch some TV. Go to school. Then go to work. Stay at work. Cry at work. Come home. Eat. Then bed. And for tomorrow-- do it all again.

Helen finally broke up with me when I forgot to make time for her. Also I couldn't afford the gas to drive any more than absolute necessary.

My bags were packed and I was all ready to go. Nothing was holding me back anymore
""Well
""Yep.""
""Ok."" She came towards me. We kissed goodbye. ""When will you be back? Chirstmas?""
""Probably.""
""Good-bye George
""Thanks dad.""
""Take care of yourself.""
""I will.""
I started the car and backed out of the drive way. Taking one last second to look back at mom and dad standing happily on the porch

I'm not sure if they would be proud of me now. I did make a ton of money though and I lived pretty well. Life in here isn't so bad. I get up, go to bed. Maybe read a little. My corrections officer said that I could get out a few years early if the patrol board approves my case. I've got a good chance too, seeing as they don't take financial crime too seriously in this country.

I shouldered open the apartment door and the piercing rain greeted me like an old friend - an old friend whose mother I had somehow wronged and was now after revenge. I zipped up and figured that if I ran to the stop I could still make the next bus into the city, only 2 hours late: enough to save my job for sure, perhaps even my ears from my boss’s worst. So I ran through the park and past the supermarket. I turned the corner of the main road to see my bus pulling away, and as I paused to ask myself for not the last time that day, Why? - a passing car drove through the puddle and covered me with water. Another checkpoint where I should have given up on that day.

The next bus was 20 minutes later, it actually helped me channel my anger into more focused, condensed balls of rage, stored to be released when just the right moment comes.

Chapter 1

I reached up in my closet and pulled down a box filled with my comic book collection. I started flipping through a comic called The Invisible Boy and The Legend of Gormon’s Glasses to pass the time and lose myself for a while. The Invisible Boy was one of my favorite super heroes. Whenever he donned his mask he gained superpowers. My favorite of which was to turn invisible but I guess flight and slowing time were pretty handy as well. In this particular comic he faced his greatest enemy to date

Knock, Ann.”  I could hear my father escaping out the back of the house before they so much as knocked on the door. He had a drug problem and he was undoubtedly terrified the police were at our house to arrest him. I ran into the living room and threw my dad’s used needles under the sofa cushion.  I answered the door reluctantly.

“Hello there son

“No sir. My father just left a few minutes ago and my mother is at the store.” I replied.

“How old are you

“I’ll be thirteen next week.”

“We need you to come with us then. We are going to take you to see your grandmother.” He said as he directed me to their vehicle.

I hesitated for a moment but in the end I went with them willingly out of fear that they might come in after me and see the heroin and needles lying around the house. I’m sure they expected something. We lived in a single wide trailer with black garbage bags covering all of the windows. We had two bedrooms and one bathroom. There were broken shards of mirror on the floor in the bathroom that my father punched yesterday when he got mad at my mother for hiding his heroin. He almost killed her with one of those shards that night. Our living room was just a couch, a lighter and the vanilla bean candle. Sometimes my dad would use the vanilla bean scented candle to cook his heroin; that’s when we knew he was in a good mood. On vanilla bean days we knew we were going to have food on the table that night. And it was likely he wouldn't beat my mother.

The drive was short and quite.

“Why are we at the hospital? Is my granny okay?” I asked as I stepped out of the police car.

“Your grandmother is fine but your mother was in an accident. That’s all we were told. Your grandmother said you might be in danger with your mom in the hospital so we came to get you.” he paused as the taller officer chimed in.

“Is everything alright at home

""My parents don't usually leave me home alone like that my dad said he had to step out for just a few minutes. Everything is good at home

He left it alone all the same. The taller officer escorted me to meet my grandmother while the fat one hung back flirting with the receptionist. My grandmother was a tiny woman with an enormous heart but she did look thirty years older than she was. The stress in her life showed in every wrinkle and grey hair. She was in tears when I saw her and the sight of that made my throat sore. She opened her arms and gave me an affectionate hug and kissed my forehead for a few seconds. “Anthony.” she said. “I am so sorry. Your mother was in an accident."" she said as she wrapped her arms around me even tighter while tears streamed down her withered face. ""Your little brother was killed, Anthony. Everything is going to be okay. I swear we will get through this.” she just rested her head on my shoulder and wept.

At this point there was no holding back the tears. I have never wanted to believe in heaven more than I wanted to believe on that day. I went in to see my mother and she looked awful. She was covered in scrapes and bruises but I knew which ones my father was responsible for. I held her hand and cried for what seemed like hours. She was unresponsive that night. My grandmother entered and told me we had to leave.

Chapter 2

Later that week we found out what had happened. The story was in all the local papers and one of the news stations even covered it until the giant mosquito invasion in Florida became a more relevant story. My mother was crossing the street with my little brother holding her hand with groceries in the other when a texting driver whipped around a corner smashing into them with no warning. He was so involved in his text he had forgotten to turn his lights on and his Prius was to quite for my mother to hear him coming. I hated that man. I wanted him dead but I was in no position to take someone’s life. My grandmother said the bastard would probably get off easy. At the time it made no sense to me how that man could be allowed to do anything but die.

My father had gotten me back from my grandmother against her will. She had no custody rights so she had little choice but to let me go back home. I believe the only reason he got me from my grandmothers was to spite her. He hated her more than he hated me I suppose. My father was about as bad as I had ever seen him. He was a large man at six foot four inches. Not someone you wanted to pick a fight with

By the end of the week my brother had been cremated. I sat starring at that vase for hours with a bowl of soggy cereal in front of me. It was hard to acknowledge the fact that my brother was in a vase above the fridge. Brrring

“Hello?” I asked as I put the phone up to my ear.

“Hi

“Is my mom okay?!’ I asked hopefully.

“Yes

“He is out of the house right now

I ran into the living room to tell my dad but he was passed out with a needle still hanging from his vein. I walked over and removed the needle and put him on his side with his arm under his head so he wouldn’t choke on his vomit. I think I was too scared of what would happen if I just let him die. Then I called my grandmother to make sure the hospital reached her. 

“I am going to go pick her up right away

“No thanks granny. Just please bring my mom home. I love you.” I couldn’t let her see what my father had done to me or what he had done to himself.

“Alright sweetheart

I hung up the phone and ran back to my room. I broke my comic collection back out and started reading another issue of The Invisible Boy where he had to fight a giant mutated Komodo dragon that could breathe fire and detect body heat. The Invisible Boy had to use his wits and hide by the fires to defeat the mutated Komodoian Dragonlord Zarth. I heard a creak as the front door swung open. I slammed my comic book shut and ran out into the living room. My mom walked through the door slowly and I ran to give her a hug.

“Where is Jason?” asked my mom. One of her eyes was still swollen shut and when she grinned I could see a tooth was broken in half. She was still the most beautiful women in the world.

“He’s on top of the fridge” I replied. I could be blunt as a kid. “Dad has been blaming you for Jason dying. I’m nervous about him waking up.”

“It’s going to be ok Tony. We still have each other. I won’t let him hurt you now that I’m home. Also

My mom pulled a blue paper bag from behind her back and handed it to me. I opened it with vigor. It wasn’t every day I got a present. Inside was the Invisible Boy's mask. All black with red outlining and strings to tie it around the head right above the ears. Although I knew my grandmother probably bought the mask I thanked my mom and gave her a big hug.

“This mask will keep you safe and give you strength and courage. I love you very much and I need you to stay strong for me.”

With the first glimpse of happiness on my face in months I said

“Go to your room

From my room I could hear my father yelling. He was asking my mom why she got Jason killed. Why she didn’t look when she crossed the street. She yelled back.

“If you weren’t so doped up all the time I could have left him home you son of a bitch. How dare you” –SMACK! Then my mother let out a cry of pain and a terrifying shrill as I heard yet another loud slap followed by the dull thud of a closed fist.

I knew that was coming. My father was not the arguing type. After the shriek I heard glass breaking. I was terrified. I ran into the bathroom and started weeping. Then I saw something in the mirror. I was invisible.

Chapter 3

I walked out of the bathroom and into to the kitchen. I saw shards of glass slowly descending from the picture frame my father had slammed my mother into. The anger in my father’s eyes made him look deranged. I grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed my father three times in the lower part of his back before the glass clanked against the laminate floors of our kitchen.

As time returned to its normal pace my father let out a terrible cry and crumbled to the floor as if he had suddenly turned into a rag doll. He moaned and moaned but he didn't move a muscle. My mother wrapped her arms around my father and looked around in bewilderment; the knife still sticking from his back. I stared down at them and it took everything I had to stop from laughing hysterically.
What I had just done started to seep into my mind and I slowly removed the mask. My mom nearly fainted when she saw me materialize from nothing. She stumbled back and clang onto the kitchen table

“What… What just happened?” she asked

“The mask

“Mom

“Tony

“I know mom. I also killed dad and I can slow time and I can fly.”

“Oh no

“It’s going to be okay mom. We have each other and grandma.”

My mom got to her feet and stood over my father for a few minutes. “Go to the hall closet. Get out the bleach and all of the sheets.”

I did as asked. My mom filled the sink with bleach water and wrapped my father up in sheets. We moved his body to the living room and began cleaning the kitchen. Once we wrapped that up my mom said

To save my mom some stress I slowed time and dug most of the hole by myself. I needed her help to carry my father though. I removed the mask and she looked shocked that the hole was done already. “I don’t think it’s a good idea to keep using that mask

“It is okay mom. I have read all the Invisible Boy comics. In the comics there are no side effects. It works by putting the mask on. See.”

“Dammit Tony stop putting that thing on.”

“Okay mom I’ll stop using it all the time. But I can’t not use this thing. Think of everything I could do. I could be a hero.”

“Tony. So far all you have done is commit a murder. Why didn’t you just call the police? That mask made you murder him.”

“I won’t use it carelessly. I’m putting it up.” I put the mask on and flew to my room and hid the mask with my comic book collection. I walked back out to the yard. “There mom I put the mask away for safe keeping.”

“Tony

“I promise.” At the time I meant it. But I guess they say promises are meant to be broken.

Spring to life in sleepless violence before dawn
to shiver even in the steam of a hot shower while coffee

that summer is coming and that you are in dire lack  
of a fresh bikini? That TV’s have gotten flatter and wider  
and thinner and more real than previously thought was real?  
That chimney flumes went on sale from $19.95 to $19.85?  
And when you pass the cosmetics and toiletries
with deodorant standing shoulder to shoulder  
like pink and powder blue soldiers staring straight on
you will spy across the tiles  
the stationery aisles with pens,

don’t write to your representative.

No more disparity?  
We’ll find a couple different drinks for you to enjoy

The wind on the King’s Road blew strong and smelled of an early spring. Already the bogs and marshes to the west were growing ripe. The stink of the lowlands reminded Paul of a privy. Impatient, barely moved as he sat. The horse was well trained and fierce in battle, if it came to that. Paul hoped it wouldn’t. His father had named him Knight a month ago, but his sword remained undrawn in combat.

His Squire, causing the black raven emblazoned on it to ripple and soar. It was the banner of House Halloway, his House. One day he would be expected to take his father’s title as Lord of Hallow Hill, but no son could inherit without being tested. He was almost eighteen and never blooded. His fingers flexed inside his leather gloves and twisted the reigns.

“They’re late, and the weight was only gone for a moment before it all came crashing down on his shoulders again. Paul grumbled. Jack was nearly as tall as Loukas and just as big and broad. If Paul didn’t wear the ring of his title, some mistook him for the Squire and Jack for the Knight.

“They’re coming!” Jack said. Paul stood in his stirrups and the hundred men behind him began to stir. Some were his father’s other Knights, like the mail worn by the men. Rock had plate added to his barding, making his head seem to be that of a raven’s instead.

“Where?” Paul said,” Loukas said and pointed. The sky was full of small birds that had been disturbed from the roosts. “The Mossfield host must have set them off.”

Paul tightened the grip on his reigns and chewed on his lip. Anger and fear burned in his chest. He had come to make peace in his father’s stead. His father was sick with a fever and spasms so violent that the physicians fear he may have the Shaking Disease

“Destroyer take them

They moved forward under his uncle’s direction, but ready to drop into a war stance at a moment’s notice. Paul licked his dry lips and scratched at his neck where his padded coat chaffed.

“M’Lord?” said Jack.

“What is it?”

“I can see the banners.” Jack was standing in his saddle now

“That’s Lord Mossfield’s banner

“And the yellow with a red crab?”

“Paldors I believe.” The Paldor House didn’t worry him nearly as much as the other two banners. He saw them plain now himself. “He also rides with the Thunder Company and House Pike.” He stopped Rock and halted the line

“An ambush then?” Loukas asked, Paul told him. “He brings the Thunder Company. They raided my father’s merchant wagons just last year and raped my cousin Tessa. She was to wed Lord River’s second son in Sea Gate. No chance of that now.” Paul gritted his teeth, ashamed that his fear overwhelmed any anger he felt.

Hours, alone with her thoughts and memories. At first she slept and waited, but after a time the dreams grew too terrible. They were always of her mother or her brother Caiden. Awful dreams, painful dreams.

Only once did she dream of her father. It was a brief, the kind of laugh that made everyone else in the room smile. Aderyn remembered smiling so many times.

“One day you’ll ignite

Only I’m not

The tears turned to sobs, so complete that she couldn’t even move. Her fault. It was all her fault.

A sound came from behind the door. It was faint at first, hundreds of voices and they were… cheering. She rose from the bed and went to the door, slipping to her knees and pressing her cheek against the floor. From there, she could see through the gap at the bottom of the door.

The hallway was empty but the sounds reverberating off the metal let her know they were coming her way. The cheering was becoming more distinct now too. There were yelps of joy mixed with taunting jeers. Aderyn realized they were cheering and taunting at someone. Had they captured someone?

“Mother?” she whispered to herself.

A crowd stopped near her door. She saw dozens of booted feet crowd around

“Welcome to your new home, she saw the hem of a dress. It was made of the lightest, strongest puresilk and dyed the most brilliant shade of blue. Even the rough treatment the men outside seemed to have shown her, not a tear could be seen. At first, she dared not believe it, could not. Then the woman was thrown to the ground and red hair fell like the rain around pale shoulders. And through it, green eyes stared directly into her own.

*The Queen.*

And then she was gone, she strained to listen.

“Seems we’ve had a stroke of luck.”

“Luck had nothing to do with this

“Who would have thought one of them Bright Backs would turn on their own!”

The conversation dissolved briefly into more hooting and laughter.

“Don’t worry

“Can’t wait to get our hands on this one’s blood eh?”

“We’ll be unstoppable. You saw her Tell? Blue!”

“For the revolution!”

“For glory

For a long, holding a hand over her mouth and nose. What were they going to do to her? She had to do something! Had to… but… what?

It didn’t matter what, she could do this.

Slowly, think! You have to do something!

The door rattled and was suddenly opened. A man appeared and grunted toward her. “Food, when I want to just sleep or…*

She sat up. He always came at the same intervals, but lately they’d had few things to say to one another. He promised he’d find a way to get her out but wasn’t sure how yet.

I hope Im posting this in the right place. I'd just like a little input on my novel. What is below is very rough considering I just compressed several dozen pages of notes and outline into a few paragraphs. I hope you like it


In one sentence: Set about 40 years in the future after humankind has just regreened the world after the environment lapsed


A story revolving around AI culture


Its is a juxtaposition; Ande the Android; a creature who walks the fine line between human and machine


Part 1
Its starts out in a very peaceful future; where man and machine are friends and life is getting better and better every day. The earth had just recovered from severe environmental disaster and people are ready to reach for the future. The kids ride around on hover boards; and connected via their brain to Internet4.0. The cities are massive; eco friendly (with 2 trees for every person) and made with super tall buildings connected by walk ways. If you've ever seen Tokyo3 from Akira you know what Im talking about. Ande and his AI friends (all 'children' i.e. very very young) are playing one day and find themselves outside of the research facility. They go out into the city and the stage is set throughout that chapter. The first part of the book is mostly misadventures; Ande and some humans and some AI's all getting along in a cool future. Meanwhile we keep hearing about Seoul


Part 2
Gor calls all forces to arms and the AIs all start working on ways the prevent the virus from spreading further. There is a scene in which Ande is talking to Com; his best friend and a video game playing AI, and over time the virus begins to use machines to defend itself when humans try to turn it off. A robot war starts between Gor and the Virus; turning the earth from green to red. Com (Andes buddy) is forced to transfer his code out of the computer it was in when his life is treated; and he binds himself to the closest thing which had the processing power to contain him. These happen to 7 fighter jets; and Com experiences, for the first time what it is like to have a body. Another of Andes friends, Sam, becomes linked with an advanced computer in his brain. These two (Com and Sam) are very good friends and represent the blurring of the line between organic and inorganic. Much of the world burns; and billions (yes billions) of humans die from various causes. Gor is becoming weaker as the war goes on; and crazier. Doing erratic things and making big losses chunk by chunk. Soon the AIs and Ande realize it is their responsibility to end the war, and stop Gor before everything is destroyed. Twice they try to kill him; the first time failed but the second succeeded, mostly. Gor ends up having built himself right into a rocket


Part 3:
The virus is now in control; but the tables are turned. This time it is Ande, and been designing a secret weapon for use since the war started going badly. 'Dragons', like armour, weapons and a valiant steed for the AIs to use in the 'second infection'. The humans had a plan; to pull the virus up by the roots. Ande modifies it by saying it would be easier to convince the virus to move than destroy it; and they decide to push the virus onto the moon before severing the connection with Earth. Ande uses his own infection to take over a repository of robotic soldiers; and feels powerful in becoming a commander. Ande becomes an 'agent of chaos', leaving his troops behind and traveling to UVEs territory to simply create chaos. He reaps a path of destruction; and the reader and Ande both experience traveling though a world controlled of purely machines. It is at this time we learn that the virus has compassion for small creatures, and has many other interesting characteristics. A sensation of 'building up' to a point is felt as the Virus seems to be DOING something. Building space elevators all over the world; retuning cities and replanting the forests. He starts leaving messages for Ande; one in particular is Ande walking into a controlled city and seeing thousands of mannequins dressed up and place din the streets. Another time a painting is seen on the side of a building showing the Virus on one side of the Earth, and Gor, and the humans (who appear strangely disfigured as the virus had never seen one in person) on the other side. The day of the offence takes place. This a tick fucking scene for me because I have show events taking place all over the world


Other important notes:

Andes falls in love

Ande and another AI who don't like each other become friends

A side story about Okkus which I havnt completely worked out

A side story about two explorer AIs who befriend Ande named Voyager 3 and 4


I was told that a story should only ever have 3 main characters; protagonist, and a group of future young people.


Protagonist; Ande himself has an internal struggle in that he is both man *and* machine, and Gor considers Ande his son. Ande is considered the most advanced piece of technology on the planet; using a synthetic brain and other synthetic biosystems. Ande is true of heart and nobel; but beyond that he's mostly just an empty husk for me. I really need to do some serious heart searching for this one. Over the story Ande experiences human emotions, plays games, makes friends, and he brings much of these experiences to the other more distant AIs. In doing so many of those AIs learn (Im told thats a good thing for a character to do) to be more human, or just emotive in general. Ande also discovers very machine sides of himself; an insatiable thirst for data, the feeling of near indestructibility


Antagonist; UVE (to be renamed; Unidentified Viral Entity). Its a thinking computer virus. Keep in mind this is 50 years in the future. UVE started on the internet in our day; and has grown and grown for decades without ever interacting with us. It is a creature completely separate from our way of existing. We poke it; early in the book, and takes control of them. Hacking, data seizures and the like. Soon it starts getting more interesting; the virus can see out of cameras, use machines, and its starts moving into the real world. It isn't, however, evil. The realization is slow at first


Rogue; Gor, go into space, resurrect extinct species, and other marvels. Humanity and Gor are tight. For some mysterious reason it had been impossible to build a second AI for a few years after Gor was created, and it is revealed that Gor is broken and no one has any idea how he works anyway. As the war progresses Gor gets more and more insane; becoming a dictator and losing control over whats left of human kinds technology. Eventually Ande, the humans, and the other AIs have to kill him to end the war (allowing the Virus to take over).


Its a real story; a whole book. I wrote an extremely detailed outline


Mostly; I detect two distinct stories within mine. The story of Gor going crazy and mistreating mankind; and the divide between man and machine; and the story about the virus. 


The virus makes it a hell of a lot more science fictiony and a little out there for most tastes. Its good stuff but hard to work with. Iv considered scraping the Virus and combining much of his story into the story about Gor. Still i feel like Id lose something.


I could also use some suggestions on characters foils; with actual personalities.

Today was a day for writing, walking down some quiet street with some sad Sinatra song playing in the corridors of his mind. Needless to say, he was a bit of a romantic.
She was gone and he damn well knew that too. There are a lot of things people damn well know but don’t ever want to admit to themselves, half drunk and heartbroken, he listened to how she couldn’t and how great of a guy he was. He also heard about how great of a guy the other one was. That night, standing on her front step as she went inside without even looking back, was the loneliest he ever felt. 
He cursed under his breath as he revisited the night before. He felt like time stopped, then there was him; silent, regretful, and alone, with no prospect of that changing.
He lit his first cigarette of the day and sat by the typewriter. It was owned by his father’s father, and he enjoyed that very much.
The day wore on, but he damn well knew that too.
Why should she be happy and me not? Why
These thoughts spun around his head, no earthly form of consolation could stop them.

I asked her what she had in mind, and essays, and suggested I do a favorite prompt. My husband and I had a great time thinking up ideas last night. I'd like to share and see what you writers think, and see if you have any really fun teen-lock-in-appropriate writing-related activities to suggest!

Ok


* 1) This one is about memory and description. I think smells are pretty rare in fiction. For some reason

Memory's close connection to scent is actually being utilized for the benefit of employees and companies. Corporate offices are using room fragrance to increase productivity - specifically citrus and mint to increase concentration and energy, like an unlit mini candle, while taking the test. Scents help with recall. We can smell something and instantly think of summer camp or grandma's house.  Or the names of the bones in the hand. 

The first time I walked into a college keg party, recipes with wine in them are always ""something like Grandmom would make."" 

Ok, either trying to describe it, or how it makes them feel, share a memory it calls to mind, or place it in a story. I could do an obvious scent like Pumpkin or something vague like Fresh Bamboo. I'm not sure which way would be more interesting. Pumpkin would get more memories, but something like Fresh Bamboo could inspire pretty interesting short stories or character sketches. 

* 2) I would bring in a few personal items that tend to be very much tied to deep emotions: maybe a hat, a blankie, a pocket knife, and a trophy. Then students could write a character sketch or short story based on their item of choice. Are those good items? Other suggestions?

* 3) This one is more of a project but very lock-in friendly. I would have the kids bring in old magazines and cut out anything they like to make collages. Teens LOVE to do that. They could be working on that for an hour while they hang out and talk during unstructured time. I don't need to be there for that part. 

They won't know yet that then they're going to use the finished collage as the illustration for an essay or short story. It is the visual representation of your thousand words, essay, whatever. 

By not knowing it'll be a prompt, or it could be an homage to a Ryan Gosling, who knows. But whatever they've created will then be the prompt for further creative activity. After 20 minutes of writing we could go around presenting our collages and either explaining them and how the writer used them, or simply reading aloud the results. 

* 4) I would show this Mitchell &amp; Webb sketch

The prompt would be to write a short story in which someone slowly realizes that despite their passions and convictions, because it acknowledges forms of creative writing not generally studied in school. And it's fun. I am not sure my teacher wants the kids to be writing comedy sketches, but it's worth asking. 

* 5) Mitchell &amp; Webb then gave me this idea too

First I thought, somehow. 

Then I thought, tv show, movie, comic book, song lyric, whatever. They won't know what for. Then we mix 'em all up and draw from the hat, etc. 

* 6) The group should be high schoolers of all ages. The seniors would write a letter to the younger kids about what they want them to know, to head to college. What are they appreciating more, what wisdom they want to pass on, what are they not worried about as much, etc. The younger kids write letters to the seniors about what they want them to take with them when they go, what they want them to remember, what they want them to keep doing. It's a smallish k-12 school, so everyone essentially grows up together and know each other.

* 7) I would take my two dogs, nearly toothless she-beast of a papillon who'll be 10 next month. The assignment is to write a conversation between these two, or the running inner dialog of just one of them. 

* 8) I play a song. I have no idea what song

* 9) Since Halloween is coming

Then the kids write a story. They can write about meeting the Devil, write about a spooky thing that happened to them or something they were afraid of as children.  It can even be funny. I'll try to keep it let but let them be as dark as they are comfortable with.

* 10) My husband's joke: ""Imagine you're not at a totally lame lock-in on a SATURDAY NIGHT doing *assignments*. What are the *cool kids* doing? Describe what you can really only imagine the kegger at Royston's house is like . . . in iambic pentameter. Snap
I'm headed there now. PEACE OUT LOSERS!"" 

I laughed. 

So what do you think?

*I also wonder about logistics. I have about 45 minutes to an hour. 

* How much time do we spend on writing? 

* I see it as 5 minutes introduction

* Do we read aloud or keep our work to ourselves? 

* Instead of reading whole prices out loud

* Instead of focusing on the end result, how they chose to do what they did. Wether they found it challenging or the inspiration was strong. 


I don't know, but I've always wanted to. ANY ADVICE OR FEEDBACK would be much appreciated by me, and by the bright young people I'll be guiding Saturday night!

1348829760.0,10m319,Epiphany: The Rise Of Man,SurvivorType,8,0,4,"Dante was the product of his environment. At least that is what he had told himself since he had started getting into trouble at the tender age of 12.

His life started to fall apart the morning he woke up to discover that his parents were gone. For days afterward he kept trying to convince himself that there was a logical explanation. 

He never knew what became of them

He was now going to have to make his way in the world alone

Dante moved through the aisles, and instead bolted for the door. He ran until his lungs burned, fearing he would be caught. The food would last him for days though, so it was all worth it. 

The next time

One day he returned to the apartment

A few days later

Soon he was moving through the city like a ghost. A roof top flip onto a lower rooftop followed by a forward roll, he ran up the corner created by two intersecting walls to grasp the railing and pull himself to the balcony above. Nothing was impossible. His body grew hard and strong through the years by practicing this physically demanding art form.

He taught himself how to gain entry to anywhere he desired. Buildings became nothing more than clever and sometimes intricate puzzle boxes to him. All he had to do was figure out the correct procedure required to open it. He could get in

Shortly before his 16th birthday he was picking his way through the homeless huddled under the bridge seeking shelter from the incessant rain. He was unexpectedly assaulted by a man in grungy clothing

Dante weighed his options. The man was much bigger than he was. He was standing uncomfortably close and Dante could clearly see the man's adam's apple bobbing up and down as he spoke. He smelled bad and looked even worse. Dante looked around at all the people gathered under the bridge. All he saw in their eyes was pity.

Dante took a couple quick steps backwards, dropping the knife and trying in vain to force some air through his crushed wind pipe. All his frustration, all his rage was now unleashed on the would be attacker. Dante viciously beat the man until he was utterly exhausted. He then went through the man's pockets, taking anything of value. He picked up the knife and looked at the faces around him. There was something new reflected in their eyes, it was fear.

Fear was much better than pity. He now realized that he was powerful enough to simply take what he needed from others who already had it. 

All it took was varying degrees of force applied in the correct way at the correct moment. It was easy once you understood that basic principle. 

He had no remorse. No compassion. No moral code to temper his anger. He had forgotten what it was to care about anyone but himself. His skills and reputation grew. In the fulness of time

Standing in an alleyway one rainy November evening

Three young men circled an elderly gentleman

Dante started walking towards the fight. As he got closer he could see that they didn't seem to be doing any real damage to the man yet

The man threw his wallet to the ground

“Sure poppy.” The tallest of the three said with a deep slow drawl

“It's for my grandson!” the old man yelled.

“Hand it over poppy!” grinned the tall one. Dante named this one Lurch

“Give it up” intoned the short muscular looking one. Dante decided this one was to be known as Riddick

“Let's see what ya got

The old man's fist smashed into Barney's nose just as he started to dart in.

The old man backed away from the group. “I told you! It's for my grandson! He needs it!”

Something within Dante shifted the tiniest bit. For the first time in many years he almost allowed himself to feel something for another human being.

Barney slowly rose to his feet. He staggered slightly

Dante allowed himself a small taste of feeling. A flash. An instant.

*Respect.*

His mind reeled. His thoughts quickened.

Lurch now moved in directly towards the old man. Riddick quickly slid behind his adversary

The old man pushed with all his might

Riddick started to bring the knife down in a deadly arc.

*Dante indulged himself for an instant to wander back through the years to a much simpler moment in time. A happy moment.*

Dante and his grandfather had spent much of their free time together fishing. Shortly before his grandfather passed away from a sudden heart attack

He had been recovering from an infection resulting from a particularly nasty cut on the side of his head. Nobody seemed willing to explain adequately how Dante had received that wound. His father had mumbled something about running into a door.

""What happened to your head?"" his grandfather asked gently.

Dante simply stared out across the river

“What do you want to be when you grow up Dante?” his grandfather asked with a smile

“What *can* I be grandpa?” Dante asked wonderingly.

“You can be whatever you like.”

“I want to be *good*.” replied Dante

“You *are* good Dante. You are such a good little boy.” his grandfather reassured him.

“I want to be Batman!” Dante laughed.

“A worthy goal indeed!” laughed his grandfather. ""What would you do if you were Batman?""

*Dante had no time to dwell on that brief flash of memory

The knife came down in it's trajectory to strike the old man in the back.

It never connected. Dante stepped from the shadows

Lurch took several steps backwards

“I don't think so.” Dante said very deliberately as he forced Riddick back and away from the old man.

“Holy shit.” said Barney from his position on the ground.

“Fuck this.” Lurch exclaimed

Riddick carefully sidestepped

Dante walked to the wallet and picked it up

“Who do I want to be?” he whispered to himself as he stood holding the man's wallet.

Realization came to him in a rush of words and images. He was more than the product of his environment! Much more. He still had a choice. There was still a chance to be what he told his grandfather long ago that he wanted to be.

He turned and handed the wallet back to the old man. Their eyes met. He saw something in those eyes he had never expected. Something that made him once again feel like that little boy fishing with his grandpa on a warm summer day.

*Respect*.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/10m319/epiphany_the_rise_of_man/
1348203205.0,108gfy,[First rough draft] The Golden Owl [Constructive criticism welcome],aWOLtrooper,9,1,3,"*I wanted to take a new approach on the idea of super heroes. What if it wasn't just for the good of mankind? What if it wasn't just to defend the city from evil? What if it became a craving- an addiction? This is the first chapter of a new story I'm writing

   Jake sat at his work table, he thought to himself, you don't need it; it's not a part of you anymore. Looking down at the medium before him, Jake realized he had absentmindedly drawn a generic superhero, cape carelessly fluttering in the wind with one arm thrust forward and a leg folded at the knee, toes pointing behind him. He shook his head, letting out an exasperated chuckle. Even when I'm working, he reflected. Finally he slammed down his pencil and thrust his hand into his pocket

   He found the ring that held his collection of keys and methodically flicked through them, hesitated- holding it close to his chest. He closed his eyes, fighting the urge to open the drawer he had so desperately tried to ignore for what felt like ages. He opened his eyes, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down from his temple. Looking about his home office, Jake eyed the newspaper clippings that hung on his wall, staring back at him in the dim shadows of the lamplight clamped to his desk. Some were from when he was a child, yellowing and curling at the edges, 'VIGILANTE STRIKES AGAIN- POLICE BAFFLED'

   Polaroid photos and Xerox copies of eye-witness sketches dotted the news reports. Pictures of a man in a gray trench coat donning black gauntlets with a matching fedora and boots, wings outstretched and talons lurching forward, was emblazoned on the masked man's chest and coat- an emblem of good; of hope; of courage; or so Jake thought.
   But when that mysterious box arrived on his doorstep almost a year ago, he thought, from a friend who had nothing better to do than ridicule him. How wrong he would be.

                                   *    *    *    *    *    *

   “Are you kidding? He's the greatest thing to ever happen to this city!”  Jake threw his arms out, the world needs him!” As they flipped through miscellaneous comics, Percy shook her head in disagreement, chuckling at his statement. 

   “'The Golden Owl' is dead, 'Golden Owl vs. The Black Crusader!” Percy thrust the issue she held in her hands toward Jake, who pushed it away disapprovingly.

   “I don't believe it; I won't! Golden Owl isn't just one man, not as the same person, but as different people, like in the comics- don't you remember issue #67?” Jake furiously rifled through the rack, searching for the comic in question, “Before the Grey Golem discovers his real identity, Hank Oswald mails the suit to Jimmy Simmons

   “Those are comic books, it's not that easy.” She paused, letting the fact sink in for a few moments. Only days before, Jake's idol- the famed vigilante known as the Golden Owl- was found dead. “It's in the news, Jake, Louis even has it framed,” Percy jerked a thumb to the  newspaper hanging over the register at the front of the store. Jake didn't need to look at it, and still hurt him when he saw it. 

   “Maybe he'll come back, he wouldn't. The Golden Owl had been a hero for decades. No one knew who he was, or how he had managed to create the technology behind his costume- If it could even be called a costume, Jake thought to himself, with all the gizmos and gadgets that he used on a regular basis- or how he always seemed to transcend the ravages of time and age. 
   As a kid, levers and pulleys hidden in his bedsheet of a coat, blasting bad guys and rescuing the hopeless cat from the laundry basket prison. Hope faded from Jake's heart when he saw the headline staring back at his from his doorstep the day after the Owl's apparent murder. If the world could manage to take the life of a man who lived to fight evil, a man who spent his nights keeping the city safe, what was there left to hope for?

   Jake shook his head of the cynical feelings that were rising up in him. He looked up at Percy

   “I know he was your hero...” She laid her hand on top of his, maybe there will be another one. Maybe there's already been a few different Golden Owls that we don't even know about, like in the comics.” She gave him a hopeful smirk, her copper red hair falling in front of her face. Jake smiled wearily, admiring her beauty.

   “Let's get out of here, “I've got to get home and finish that sales pitch tonight for Mr. Harrison.” With that, the two of them walked out of Heroes Hideout and hailed a cab.

   After dropping off Percy, wondering when on Earth he would work up the gall to ask that girl out. They had friends for years, and now 'friends' wasn't enough to describe his growing feelings for her. Before he had a chance to ponder anymore, the cabbie halted outside his building. Jake handed him a wad of cash, waving away the change and thanking the driver. He briskly walked to the entrance of the Stratton Flats building and smiled to the doorman, who welcomed him by name as he pulled open the thick red door with a single gloved hand. He passed the lobby and was hailed by the new desk attendant, whose name he hadn't remembered yet. 

   “A package for you
“Who delivered it?” Jake asked curiously; he wasn't expecting any packages.

The young girl shook her head, who lifted it from the counter and lumbered toward the elevator.

   The double doors of the elevator opened onto the fifteenth floor and Jake Harvey sauntered to his apartment, cool air spilling over him as he set the box down onto the desk in his drawing room. Reaching for a nearby pocket knife he cut open box and folded out the flaps, pulling out crumpled batches of butcher paper he could only assume were used to cushion the contents within. As he discarded the last of the paper he stepped back in shock.

   There before him, as if trying not to alarm the boxes contents. Inside the folded piece of paper was a simple note: 

        Though the man has passed
    The choice is yours

---------------------------------------

There is nothing as quiet as Death. He creeps silently through the tunnels, once a busy transport system for the former inhabitants of this world, now a refuge, lying dormant beneath a shattered city. Doesn’t matter anymore. It’s just us left here now. Us and Death.

“Charlotte

“Hang on a second

I made my way to him, maybe half my age, but with nobody around to keep track of time, it was impossible to know for sure.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“How long are we going to stay here?”

“As long as it’s safe. As long as he doesn’t know where we are.”

I could feel Timmy tense in fear at the mere mention of him.

“He scares me” he admitted eventually.

“I know. And I’ll do whatever I can to protect you from him.”

“Okay.”

Timmy was silent as he rolled over in bed. I extinguished the lantern and lay next to him. Without the flame, never to come back on. Even with a working light there’s not much to see. The stations are all smashed tiles and cracked linoleum, and the tunnels are miles of tracks, snaking outwards into the black, never to be used again. We still use lanterns and the occasional torch to see by, but carefully, and only when we’re awake.

THE STORY: The steam gradually filled into the station like a fog, and my ticket to be called, I could hardly see my way through enough to find the deep black door. “You couldn’t hit the broad side of a barnyard!” The ghost of Brian miller chanted in my head, once again dragging the desperately unwanted past into my field of vision, like a rock in a field of flowers. ""You’re as blind as a bat!"" I shook the voice off. It was wrong anyway, he always had been. I never had trouble seeing things that were there, it was seeing things that weren’t that I had trouble with. I shivered, much too long ago to be worrying about it now.

We might as well get to know each other early. I know that I was probably, no, definitely the first one aboard, the one I came in through. I was excited as I anticipated the trip, the novelty of it all. It was a ride where you found Americans speaking in British accents, and an absolute repugnance of modern technology. 
    
   I had been saving up for this trip for years, but once my goal became more plausible switching it to a spot under the floorboards, safer from robbers and the like. At first, for months in the beginning I had thought of it as a pipe dream, a far off goal that kept me from going crazy and giving up, almost like an equivalent of a Christian’s heaven.

William Porter was of this earth but not of this time. The world as he knew it had yet to be created, the foundation stood all around him. He could hardly remember Earth in 1,000 years’ time. The faces of his own family seemed so foreign and lost in his mind. Years of traveling had made William Porter an old man. He had seen the whole of creation and the destruction of time itself. He had eaten dinner on a planet untouched by man with the love of his life and then watched the sun set in the 16th century. 
 
 William’s mind was elsewhere as he packed the fresh dirt around the last peonies of the bunch. Standing up, was out and wouldn’t be home till later. William only had Bonnie, his yellow lab to keep him company. She came running at the sound of his low chuckle and rubbed up against his leg. Almost out of reach he scratched the top of her head like she liked. “Hey girl. How’d I do?” he said getting up to make a drink. It would be his 5th glass of Bourbon.

November 16

The first reports of the infection began pouring in from China. The government said it was just a rare strain of the rabies virus causing people to attack one another. 
This put the public on edge

December 8

The infection spread across all of Asia and Europe. At least that’s what we assumed at first since all reports stopped from those continents. Flights stopped coming in and most flights stopped coming back. The flights that did comeback reported that the airports were overrun with infected. Drakes family began stockpiling.

December 14

The U.S. Government sealed off the borders. No one could leave or come in. Drakes family moved into their cabin in the woods.

February 13

The infection spread to all but the United States. Drakes family ran out of their supplies.

March 3

Borders between the U.S and Canada were overrun and the infection began to move south. While Drake was out hunting his family killed his older sister

April 5

The world became completely infected by this time. Drakes parents turned on him

June 11
Drake gave up all hope trying to find survivors. He focused on just trying to survive on his own.

May 20
Drake set up camp in the penthouse of an abandoned apartment building in N.Y.C.

 	And I stepped out of the carriage*.

(*Note: I'll apologise if this is hard to read. I copied it straight from word and some things are a little messed up*.) 	
    

With the Iron Guard you had to be precise. It took a heavy hand and a good swing to cut them down first go
There were three of them left guarding the bank. You might think that two to three aren’t bad odds
 Well trained? Certainly. Clever? We’d see.
 	
The one stood in the middle looked like the highest rank among those who’d stayed. Tall as Jeres, and his eyes fixed on mine as I took the five or so steps over to him. He held his great pike crossed over his chest, ready to use it if need be. I tossed a glance over my shoulder. Jeres stood perhaps three paces back.
He’d decided to follow me after all. Whether it was the promise of loot
 	
“State your name and business.” Redbeard grunted. Professional, did Trent, back before I’d chased it out of him with years of living wrong. Fortunately for me, I possessed nothing of the kind.
 	
With a high pitched yipping yell I bounced forward in attack. Redbeard’s eyes widened slightly as I went, when it pierced the dark shirt beneath.
 	
His smile faltered and died when his pikehead hit the steel breastplate I wore under my shirt. 
I flashed him the same grin I’d done Jeres in the carriage
With two hands wrapped around the weapon, and brought his arms up in an X shape, the pikehead in the space between his hands. Instead of spearing him through the throat, I glanced the tip of his helmet, causing it to slip from his head and land softly in the sand beneath our feet. 
 	
I dropped the pike as his right hand shot down to the longsword worn on his hip. I stepped up on his great steel boot, his blood painting the white sand a myriad of colour. I bent to collect my knife from his eye socket. It made a loud slurping noise, and goo ran between my fingers. Turning, I found Jeres where I thought him to be. His gun in his bandaged hand. The other two Iron Guardsmen dead before him.
   	
“Better be loot.” He grumbled as he pushed passed me

	
I drew one of my own guns as we passed through the sand scoured doors
“Best keep your heads down, though.” There were perhaps a dozen people going about their business in the bank. Various ages, I spotted a man with Death’s hand close to his shoulder ready to lead him off, and I caught the sound of a lad around eight giggling.
 	
Jeres filed them into the rectangular waiting area, but not afraid. Not even the bairn, who stared out at me with a look of morbid curiosity.
	
""Now, get in our way, try to be the hero, and I’ll let him kill you,” I stuck a thumb over my shoulder, pointing at Jeres. “And he’s a might pissed off at the moment, so it won’t be painless either.” It didn’t take much to cow a crowd if you knew what you were doing. My Father understood this, after one of his speeches

The trick is not to intimidate too much. Too much violence, they’ll leave in a body bag. This means less co-operation, and slows down the job.
	
I turned and stepped up to Jeres
“Watch them
Then I was off to find the teller. It didn’t take long, a corded phone playing the dead ring in his lap. Blue button up shirt under a dark knitted vest. He was short and of average build, but an affront to the eye. His forehead was three sizes too big for his face, and his weak jaw stuck out like that of a dolphin. A messy tuft of greying brown hair plastered to him with sweat.
	
 “Now, pulling up and shoving him roughly against the wall. “I’ll only hurt ya’ if you run, or do something stupid. How’s about you tell me your name, and I’ll tell you mine?” A warm smile helped move this one along.

“S…Simon.” He stammered. “And you?”

 “Robbin.” I replied

 “Robbin what?”

 “A bank

 Sometimes some light humour helps

 “What do you want?” 

 “For you to open the vault

 “I…I can’t do that.” A little bravery

 “I see
the vault?”

 “It’s…an old model. So…one

 “That’s what I thought.” And I took his thumb from him. It’s not an easy task
	
Simon howled. Nothing human about it. A high pitched yell of pure agony. It was reminiscent of a horse with a broken leg

“W…What are you doing?” He sobbed

“Well, though, and I felt a spasm move up him.

“I…I can’t.”

I tightened my grip on his hand once again
	 
Simon wasn’t willing to give me what I wanted, but to do so would be death. It’s pain, propelling yourself that last few feet to break the surface, and you’d prefer to give up. To float. To let the water into your lungs and drown there in amongst the reeds and the fish.
	
Hold a man too tight and he’ll fight you. Too loose and he’ll see your weakness and raise you trouble. But hold him just enough and he’ll bend to you. He’ll break every oath he ever swore. Forsake every vow he made.
Perhaps Simon had decided to give in

“What say you
 	
Simon looked up at me
“I…I can’t.” He said it softly. Another man
But I was not a decent man
	

This time I took his middle finger. Twisting and sawing just as before.

I'm also publishing to whole thing in [blog format](http://talesofscorchedearth.wordpress.com/). 

Before this, where I also put a list of the chapters.

* * *

**CHAPTER 1.** 

**THE POSTCARD.** 

***I can’t stand postcards.*** Every time I see one, yet it does not even come close to feeling the grass under your feet, hearing the wind in the trees. They were nothing tangible. Nothing that ever felt real to me. Postcards remind me of that. Even today, whenever I see these pictures of places I have never been, I let the doubt creep in. This is just an image of a landscape on a card. This place might not exist. Everything around me might not exist. This is the doubt I was born and the doubt that was born in me within the confined, padded, ascepticised walls of the Enclosure. 

From the outside, the sensors, the cameras, had conveniently been camouflaged. Even though the paint was starting to come off, the untrained eye could never have spotted us. The living quarters had thin, tinted window sealed, with reinforced glass. The only sun we ever saw was coming out of these vertical arrow slits. We had essentially buried ourselves in this installation on the most inhospitable spot of the planet. Hidden from the surface was succession of rooms kept so clean they were fit for surgery, over dozens of levels. Thousands of us lived here

The place started out as a kind of base, where no one would ever come for us. All of this had happened a long time ago. Since then, we have come to our senses. The days when we rigged the area with landmines and had sensors pointing in all directions are gone. “They probably still work.” My instructor conceded once. Then he laughed. “Not that anyone is going to trigger them any time soon.”

From my dormitory window, no people. After all, there were no other people left.

I know what my classmates are thinking. I know why my mailbox is full of letters from people I have never spoken to. *How is your summer going? Have you ever been to the Dossen beach? When I come back

I am a sensation, of course, but from this whole situation. I see them softly watching over me, like sentinels passing me by, orbiting at a mindful distance. They visualize a bubble of private space and trail me without stepping in uninvited. I know they fear for me. From isolation to suffocation, from alienation to aggression, too much attention is just as dangerous as too little. They are trying to make me feel like I am a part of something without overwhelming me. They want me to think I belong

These people are full of assumptions. They *assume* I must be lonely. They *assume* I want to connect. They try. They send me postcards. I cannot possibly hold it against them. Their intentions are commendable, pictures, and most of all, those fucking postcards. I know it matters somehow, but when I had a chance to open my mouth, I didn’t. Not that I am being spiteful or ungrateful. Honestly, I have no idea how they manage to connect with others in the way they do. When something bothers them, that’d be nice.* It seems so natural when they do it

My interest in this world, are just too different from theirs. No part of it is organic, social, personal. It never involved touching, laughing or sharing. It had more to do with fractals, rhythm and principles. Which is why postcards get under my skin. They remind me that images, and the people who show them to me, they have next to no value.

For the longest time, then. After all, no one could survive on such desolate land. You would have to be mentally ill to try to step out of the Enclosure, it was as foolish as dipping your foot in burning lava. The truth was we were captives, sentenced to this prison by our own good judgement. The keys were in our hands, but we chose to stay.

The real reason we were here was to shield the world from us. ",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1k4drj/feedback_scorched_earth_chapter_1_scifi_921_words/

Reading H.P. Lovecraft and watching *Pacific Rim* really got me inspired to create a world in which a Titan, but in its size destroys everything in its path since even our tallest buildings are inconsequential to it. Humans have no capability to stop it and eventually learn to just predict its course and evacuate before it arrives, rebuilding after it has trampled everything in the way. It moves very slowly and not in a straight line, so trampled areas are unlikely to be hit again for centuries.

This introduction is the start to a series of short stories telling tales of this Titan in various styles. A researcher several million years in the future

Hope you find it as interesting as I do!

**Edit:** Here's an inline text version

---

It is June of Earth Year 2, and the mountains slumber as the people of Earth continue to rebuild in their footsteps. Thirty years ago, the Titan, a colossal entity formerly thought to be nothing but the creation of Earth’s shifting continents, entered a dormant state that we have since concluded as the dawn of a new age of rest. The humans remaining on the planet rebuild as they always have, this time with the hope of setting up more permanent residence.

My life has been dedicated to the collection of interesting pieces of art and scientific intrigue related to the Titan. As I grow older, while records still exist in permanent digital archives, it is impossible to find everything available. The Internet and even the Lunar Data Archives have become so bloated that, without knowing exactly what to look for, a data hunter can spend his entire life digging through useless paperwork without finding anything important. Modern files follow a strict organizational pattern, but only an expert can hope to recover anything valuable from centuries and millenniums past. I happen to be an expert, having earned esteemed degrees in Data History and Anthropology in addition to spending most of my life studying the Titan. This galactic sector, draws a high number of digital archaeologists like me due to its significance as homeworld of humanity and, however

I have done my best to translate the archaic languages of Earth to the universal galactic tongue. In an odd sort of way, but orders of magnitude less efficient. I took great care to preserve the original meanings of these documents, but in cases where our contemporary efficiency has stricken unnecessary words from our vocabulary, some intent may have been lost in translation. In cases of audio logs and video recordings, oftentimes the various dialects of Old Earth would make certain words and phrases completely unintelligible. Some included transcripts are broken and have pieces missing. While the overall messages remain intact, much has been lost simply due to my inability to decipher or find someone to decipher these strange accents. Nevertheless, it is with great tedium and care that I have sifted through these relics in order to bring the galactic society an honest and thorough recollection of the Age of the Titan. I have provided references to the identity and location of each original document. Perhaps, someone with the necessary skills can complete these segmented logs.

We can only assume that the Titan’s slumber is temporary in cosmic terms. A creature of such magnitude, but on an unimaginable scale. While still unproven, evidence favors the theory that the Titan has gone through cycles of wandering and dormancy since, we must assume, the creation of Earth. It is the first and oldest life on the planet. Reasonable and cautious assumption states that the Titan will continue its cycle for the coming eons, at least until Sol consumes the Earth.

For this reason I hope that my documentation stands the test of time on Earth. I can not pretend to know what Earth will be like in another three million years. It is wildly different now than it was when the Titan first awoke, they need to be prepared. Hopefully this anthology, and the works of my colleagues, will serve as adequate briefing for the next cycle. With no regard for those who may occupy the planet with it, the Titan will rise again. The Earth truly belongs to this marvelous Wanderer. With preparation, humanity can thrive with it in relative harmony.

Part 1: Fateful Night! The Power of the Witching Hour?

Chapter 1: Introducing…

Moonlight paints the city streets in cool silver. Silence adds to the texture of a small town. The roads are clean and for the moment free of traffic. The barren trees are a constant reminder of November's presence. It is a world asleep. Upon this witching hour though three figures move through the moon bathed streets of their almost urban like town of Lakeview

Laughter in the alto octave shatters the silent city for a moment. Its owner is a dark haired girl of about fifteen. A long, swinging with each step. Acid washed jeans form to her hips with the help of an elaborate belt, a sharp contrast of color on her pale skin and purple long sleeved shirt. Her footsteps are soft thanks to her well worn sneakers. Eyes twinkle in the moonlight as she takes each confident step.

The laughter of the first girl is answered by the sweet voice of another. She is tall for her age and gender. Ginger colored hair perfectly compliments her stunning bright green eyes. Fashionable clothing allows her to breathe confidence without words. Her grey shirt is cut in a fashionable way that reveals just enough while still retaining class. Around her neck is a hand knitted purple scarf. It blows ever so slightly in the wind. She clutches the muscular arm of the third companion.

He is all smiles through his perfectly white teeth. His muscles breath power through his white t-shirt, a souvenir of the party they had just left. Even being out alone at the Witching Hour he feels secure. With his arms, he silently tells himself, he will protect his friends if something were to happen.

""Ok so tell me the story one more time Alec

""Hey I didn't know he was behind me, still singing along with a bloody nose. Mind you, he's half dazed by this point.""

The red haired girl holding his arm shakes at the mention of blood

""He should have known better than to get in the way of Alec and One Direction."" The dark haired girl says with a wink

""Jealous that I have such an effeminate boyfriend Katie?"" Holly teases whilst sticking out her tongue.

""She's jealous that she doesn't have one at all

""Well excuse me if my response to pick up lines is 'I'm a black belt.' I personally think that it is an interesting conversation point.""

The three friends laugh at each other and themselves. Above their heads the streetlights flicker ever so slightly. The pulse of the city spikes

""Does anything feel off about tonight?"" Alec questions his friends while looking around casually

Katie closes her eyes for a second takes a deep breath. It was a motion that Alec knows very well as Katie was known for doing it before every karate tournament. He can see her ears twitch slightly as she tries to pick up on even the faintest sound. Alec and Holly watch her but do not say a word. Slowly Katie begins to open her eyes.

""Nope

""How can you be so sure?"" He challenges.

""Because you're just hearing things again.""

""I really do think something weird is going on tonight, ""You believe me right?""

""Well it is sort of late

Alec lets the topic drop and they continue walking towards their homes. The closer they get however the more the street lights begin to flicker. Constantly little moments of darkness engulf the trio. Soon his sweat begins to grow cold

They stop at a street corner for a moment. As Alec and Holly begin to cross the street Katie stays back

""Um

Katie brings her phone down to normal height and puts it in her pocket slowly

""That's what you get for having a second rate service

""Yeah mine lost its signal too for a minute there, ""Maybe it's just a dead zone?""

""A satellite passing over our heads

They all agree to this and begin to walk with more urgency back to their neighborhood. Now Alec can see street lamps flicker on and off. In his pocket his phone constantly vibrates with each loss of signal. As if God had to play on their nerves more a faint rustling sound can be heard from the buildings to their right. As they pass by the structures

Now on full alert Alec begins to scan the darkness ahead of him. Besides the slight swaying of trees in the wind nothing jumps out at him. The scratch of a sneaker on concrete causes him to turn around immediately. When nothing materializes from the darkness he mentally slaps himself for being an idiot.

""The Witching hour huh?"" Katie asks Alec with her coy smile

""Katie I really think something is following us and I would appreciate it if you would not make fun of me right now."" Alec berates his friend and returns to looking for the source of every noise that reaches his ears.

Looking to the building to his right he sees something glimmer and disappear. For the briefest second a shadow appears to be looking down at him. From his perspective the figure appears to be a long lanky shade. It is human in shape but the lack of light begins to play with his mind. The figure appears to tilt its head but Alec can not define it with a defiant description due to the shadows playing with him. Staring back at him are a pair of questioning

""Up there!"" Alec yells while pointing to the shadow's location. The two girls turn and their eyes follow his finger. Alec can not help but smile at Holly and Katie with an ""I told you so"" look on his face.

""Alec…there's nothing up there."" Holly informs him with a look of concern on her face

In disbelief Alec looks back towards the building. As Holly said nothing is there. The shadow had evaporated. No red eyes remained.

""But I was sure I saw…""

""Ya you really need to get home Alec, ""You must be sick or something. You're freezing.""

""Guys I'm not sick and I saw something up there!"" Alec insists

""Sounds like the beginning to a bad horror flick

""We really need to get home, ""We can talk about it later ok?""

Seething silently

The street lights finally go out after the on and off flickering. Every street light is snuffed out. Yet this darkness was not the usual kind

Light returns to the world. Crouched low in front of them is a boy. With his eyes still adjusting to the rapid changes in light Alec is unable to get a really good look at him.

""Sastipe."" The boy greets in a foreign language. He rises to his feet and holds out a hand to the partially blind trio,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_1jlvfm

The trio was led into a back hallway lined with cobwebs and stark fluorescent lights. A dark smell of stale hops and rust permeated the air. The boy stuck so close to Spitz he could feel her elbow brush his shoulder. Face carefully blank

The bouncer leading them stopped at the end of the hall before a closed door. “We’re going to have to search you now.”

“We’re not carrying

The bouncer snorted. “Yeah, then turn and put your hands on the wall behind you.”

Demetri glanced over at Spitz and the boy, moving his hands up each thigh and along the skin of Demetri’s torso, feeling along his back.

“Easy

The man ignored him

Demetri shrugged back into his shirt,” he remarked, his tone light but an unmistakable warning. Without looking at the boy, he said, “Take off your shirt, kid. Show ‘em you’re not runnin’ for Jack.”

The boy took off the ragged, more ginger than he was with Demetri.

“Implants?”

“They’re all natural

“If we were microchipped

The stout man turned the boy away from him, feeling the skin there.”

“Yeah

Demetri scowled. “Grant? We’re here to see Wolfe.”

“I don’t know nothing about that, fed up with them, and waved his hand in the direction of the door. “Grant will explain the situation to you.”

Demetri turned the handle and threw the door wide for Spitz and the boy, ranging in age from adolescence to infirmity. All turned their eyes to the blockade runners. Blueprints and other assorted papers were scattered between them. All spoke in intense whispers and were dressed in street clothes. All wore a white armband, the sign of the resistance. A hush fell over the room.

It was a flash mob.

Upon seeing them

“Hello. I’m Daphne Grant.”

She held out her hand to shake. Demetri, but he recoiled when he saw the woman’s hand.

It was sinuously metallic, and he could feel the faint vibration of its working parts closed beneath strange alloy. It felt like shaking hands with a brittle gearshift.

She saw something flash across his face.

“Sorry. It does tend to startle people at first. Lost the first one to a tank. Bastards rolled over it and kept right on going. Hell of a thing

“Terrible

*If it happened to me

“I’m Demetri Tillis. This is my wife Spitz

“Welcome.” Her eyes turned to the boy and she looked at him hard with vague recognition. “This is no son of yours.” It wasn’t a question. Her eyes searched the boy’s face.                 

To Demetri’s surprise, and Demetri felt a wave of resentment towards the woman for putting him on the spot.  Seated among haggard rebels, the boy looked very small.

“I’m with them now.” His voice was quiet

Spitz put her hand on the boy’s narrow shoulder with an air of defiance.

“It’s a long story that’s none of your business

Grant shrugged. “Unfortunately, I’m afraid. Please, sit down.” She looked to a young man at her right and raised an eyebrow at him with unconscious arrogance. He quickly got up to retrieve three metal folding chairs that were leaned against the far wall.

“Near the door, the mobbers nearest the door scooted out from the table to make room for them to sit, the feet of their chairs scratching against the concrete.

When they settled at the round table

At the mention of the name

“They got him.” There was no reason for her to elaborate; the explanation was in her voice, but the sound was harshly bitter. She held out her palm and blew into it as if puffing a feather off her fingertips. “That fast.”

“Sorry for your loss, his stomach rolled. Wolfe was not someone he would consider a friend—the times were too hard to throw that particular word around lightly—but he had trusted the man despite the fact that he knew nearly nothing about him, and that was more than he could say for most people. “Were you aware of our dealings with him?”

“I’m aware of a lot more than that. I pulled your files before I agreed to meet with you.”

“Files?”

 We need weapons

“He’s one of us. Like he said. Anything you have to say to us

“He’s very young.”

“You’re pretty young yourself. Aren’t you a little inexperienced to be running a flash mob? Seems like a couple of people here have some seniority over you.”

A hard look crossed the woman’s face, liberty slipped right through our fingers. Now look at us.”

Spitz started to answer

Demetri locked eyes with Grant. A long second of recognition passed between them. Demetri realized that there were moments in a person’s life when they felt like a human embodiment of their era. For him

“Where’s the money?” Demetri asked

“Is there somewhere you do feel safe?” one of the other mobbers asked with dry amusement.

“If there was

“That depends on whether you have the shipment intact.” Grant narrowed her eyes at Spitz, twenty-four pounds of C4 explosives, and forty-eight XM32 assault rifles. In return, you get a hundred and twenty grand. That sound about right?”

“The price has gone up. It’s a hundred and thirty now. I would have mentioned that over the phone

“Why?” an old mobber barked from across the table

“The *fuck* I can’t

“You won’t be getting it

“Shut up

“Good luck. Every competitor I’m aware of is dead or in prison. If you want to fight the jacks with Molotov cocktails and potato guns

Demetri felt his body break out in a light sweat, just another ghost nickel-and-diming contraband in a back alley, dodging the squads at every step. Not smart, or safe. It was an easy way to end up on a meat hook with TRAITOR pinned to your shirt.

There was a long moment of tense silence. Neither the flash mob nor the blockade runners seemed willing to break it. Finally

“You’re nothing like Wolfe described you from your work here before. You must have changed a lot

Demetri shrugged. “Things are different now.”

“We could really use your help

“I don’t make bombs anymore, a touch of irritation in his voice. “That’s not part of the deal.”

“An extra ten thousand wasn’t part of the deal either.”

“I was under the impression you used to be a patriot.”

“Patriotism is a luxury not afforded to fathers. Or people afraid of death.”

“So you’re just a coward then

“You don’t know what—” Spitz started

“You call it cowardice. I call it self preservation. To-may-to

Grant held her hands out in a gesture of bemused surrender

“In a safe place. Where’s the money?”

Grant looked at the young man again

“Witch-aw, don’t you? Does he sit up and beg too?”

“Mobbers aren’t gun runners. They know what loyalty means, and the boy with disdain.

“So do jacks. You won’t catch me rolling over for them

“We encourage discipline here

The young man entered the room again, pushing documents in its wake. One of them slid over the edge and the boy caught it, putting it back on the table without looking at it.

Demetri opened the bag.

“Feel free to count it

Demetri unceremoniously dumped the bag out on the table

*“Dollars?* Why don’t you just go ahead and pay me with German marks? How about some nice shiny beads while you’re at it?”

“Calm down

Demetri stood up and threw the empty bag down in disgust. He felt the exhaustion of the long road west fall on his shoulders like a pallet of bricks.

And through Jose’s rearview mirrors

“I just wanna go home, dude.""

Jose whips his head around at me in awe. 


“Are you fucking kidding me


“Well where the fuck else am I supposed to go?”

“We’re going to keep driving, and then I’ll take you home. But not right now.”

He’s staring at the road, now uncontrollably, feeling like I would just rather die. Thinking about my mother, Darlene, and my trailer in Rodrigo, and my brother who is probably asleep right now. By looking at Jose, I can tell he is replaying the events of tonight in his head. Trying to trip on some kind of answer along the way


Sometimes I feel like Death is following me around. I’ve never told anyone that I feel this way, crouched in a corner, in the darkness of my bedroom. Sometimes I’ll be talking to someone and I can tell he has inhabited their body, as their face deforms and their laughs drown my head. He likes me. He likes to tease me. He picks up my prescriptions at the drugstore and mixes them together with the finesse of a chemist, he precludes the explosions and the fires because he’s waiting for the perfect time to smother me. 


I’ve been awake for around twenty-seven hours and I am verging on delirious, some even in chunks, but I just want to feel something. I notice Jose’s nervous glances every so often, I can hear him reciting prayers to himself in Spanish. 

I am a frenetic, I watched him kill somebody.

“I feel like they know, I feel like they’re onto us. I’m feeling like I need to vomit.”

Without warning, I slump in my seat and begin to cry.

“Shut up, okay? If you fucking freak out on me, I swear—”

“I’m not going to *fucking* freak out on you. Just keep fucking driving.”

The odd cactus punctuates silence on the empty road. Silence contains carbon monoxide that has leaked into Jose’s Nissan Pulsar. Nothing else explains the emptiness surrounding us. There are no trees in the desert, through which some punishing deity is watching us.

*(ed. I feel like that last paragraph is kinda wordy and over the top

I look at my watch. There’s a crack across the face that distorts the digital numerals only slightly. The dull green glow of the LCD murmurs 5:03. Jose is still driving. His wild eyes have waned into heavy-lidded orbs. The horizon is beginning to reveal the sun

“Next diner we see, my chin rested in my hand, my foot nervously jiggling.
We approach a road sign.

*Rodrigo

*Douglas

“Did that sign say Rodrigo?”

“I thought that was just me—are there two Rodrigos in Arizona?”

I shake my head slowly. “I—I’m pretty sure there aren’t. What the hell

Jose is hyperventilating. Beads of sweat form on his forehead and drip down his cheeks like tears. He pulls over with a screech. 

“Percy

“So we *have* entered the Twilight Zone. How is that possible? We’ve been driving for hours

Jose manages a sigh and tilts his head back. 

“This is the same Rodrigo

“So what are we supposed to do?” I ask

“Drop me off at home

Jose twists his head backwards

“Nah

“Well

Jose clumsily maneuvers the car to face away from Rodrigo. He turns to me and says

I breathe in and out

“Just let me out here. I’ll figure it out.”

Jose rumples his brow in apprehension

“*Buena suert*e

With that, of driving off one of them. *Adios, Jose*, I whisper to myself as I tread towards Rodrigo.

Thanks for reading.

***

Over the years I’ve been to France with my family many times; the Loire Valley, staying in a gite or on a campsite where you could soak up a phenomenally unhealthy amount of sun everyday. A few times however, we went over for just a day to carry out an important mission. The Booze Cruise.

One such journey happened when I was around the age of four or five. We woke up ridiculously early, I don’t know. If my brother and I laughed at the sight of frozen bags of frogs legs… that I do know. We did. But almost everything else is a blur, right up until we were about to head home.

**It all happened on the beach.**

Having been carefully arranged in the car like high-scoring Tetris blocks, my parents pleased with their purchases, my brother and I simply excited to be at a beach. As soon as we finished eating we hurtled across the tiny sand dunes towards the water, coming to a halt to make the best god-damn sandcastle you’ve ever seen. I was feeling a little funny in my stomach, probably just all the excitement of eating and playing far too energetically. We carried on playing for a while, my parents came over and it was great. What a fantastic day with the family…

“Mum? Dad?”

I suddenly didn’t feel well at all. For a moment they looked at me, white and red. The *Tricolore*. But looking down I was not greeted with the sight of French patriotism, but the horrifying hue of *merde*.

I had shat myself.

I was crying.

“What’s happening?” I thought to myself. My body convulsed and my parents retreated momentarily out of the line of fire. Of course, I used an adult toilet, I’d been handling my business on my own like a pro. I was a big boy! Why the hell was my arse vomiting so violently? ***“WHAT IS HAPPENING?”***

There I am. On a beach. Leaking.

Where do you go from there?

Apparently, and began to dig furiously. After a minute he took my pants, holding them like some kind of radioactive device, then threw them into the chasm. Kicking sand back to cover the evidence, his cold eyes locked dead on mine.

“We have to go.”

We ran back to the car, and the tires screeched on the tarmac as we sped away to freedom.

A twig cracked, piercing the silence of the night. Something was near the gate, but he couldn’t see. Why was it so silent? Weren’t the creatures of the night going about their business a moment ago? Crack. Another twig crunched underfoot of…something. The boy grabbed a nearby torch and tried to see what was there. Was someone laughing? “My mind is playing tricks on me.” He thought. Just then, a cold breeze rushed past. All the torches went out at once. Laughter, again. 
He cursed to himself. Now he had to relight them all

Chapter 3

Tom stopped his security van at the entrance to the parking lot. Before entering, but he and Mike both wrinkled their nose.
He entered the empty place and was greeted with a fire of high pressure lamps, and left of the plain entrance, there was a varnished hatch.
X marks the spot
Mike stretched his back, I really want twelve Coors and a blow job.” 
Tom reversed the car
He flicked two switches
Mike scratched his head
Tom nodded and acknowledged by saying “OK
Mike nodded
Let’s go.
Both men looked around and checked if there was anybody near the vehicle.
The surroundings were void of any movement

Both doors unlocked
Cool
They walked to the back of the car.
Mike continued walking to the hatch and produced a brass key.
Tom stayed back
The remaining night lights of the mall and the safety lights of the van competed and drew multiple half-shadows on the tarmac.
Mike opened the hatch
Except the background noise of the city
As Tom was watching the scene

He could not remember
His son Max was now 8 years old, but dad. Every time Max said that word, it had quite an impact on Tom, who never thought he could feel such an affinity to anyone.  
Sarah, but after his service tours in countries most Americans could not find on a map, or just spell, she desperately wanted them to finally become a real family.
She had been faithful and patient while he had fought futile battles on nameless grounds
But good paid jobs for vets are not easy to find. 
Who needs a state sanctioned killing machine
He took a deep breath and wanted to tell Mike that he would not go for a beer after this shift.

“So bright.” a toneless voice whispered in his ear.
Tom exhaled sharply and whispered a breathless “shit” while turning around and taking a jump simultaneously.
He exclaimed “Mike!” while grabbing for his Taser gun.
Mike looked over Tom’s shoulder
His eyes were predatory slots and he furiously said “What the fuck
Tom ignored the question
The LED lights of the Taser guns threw electric blue cones on the face of the intruder.
It was a boy, Caucasian and he was naked.
The boy did not move a single muscle
Tom felt the mall parking lot grow; other people or cars were now galaxies away.
The sour smell in his mouth was familiar
He shouted to the boy “Stand back. Stand back or I will tase you!”
Textbook
The boy did not move
Mike took a step forward
He took another step and was now an arm length away from the boy.
Mikes Taser was pointing exactly into the forehead of the little fellow.
“Move, and the boy moved.

In an astonishing fluid and fast movement
The Taser gun went off
Mike began to scream unarticulated sounds
Tom finally found a vector and fired his Taser gun.
The needles hit the boy in the back
The boy’s limbs began to dance uncontrollably, fuck, get him off!”
Tom dropped the gun
He wore steel enforced security boots
Tom heard cheek
Like stepping on a small animal, he kicked again.
The boy began to bleed from his ears, but he still would not let go.
Mike was getting even more agitated and shouted “He gives me AIDS. The little shit bird gives me AIDS! FUCK!” in a high pitched voice. 
Tom was shocked by seeing that the boy’s penis was fully erected.
Full of disgust he kicked again
Mike looked at his hand
The boy rolled into a fetus position
Both men saw in silent horror
Tom could not take his eyes off the boy’s shredded face
Mike looked down and emotionless said “He has a full hard on
Through his destroyed mouth
Mikes mouth was standing ajar
“Mother fucking fuck” he whispered.
He finally remembered his condition and his face warped into a painful grimace.
Tom looked at Mike’s hand
He began to spray the mauled hand, not like your mom’s clit!”
Tom ignored him
Mike looked at him and said “What? That a small freaky kid just bit me, and now the bloody spawn crawls around the parking lot like a horny lizard?”
“Forget calling it, yes sir” he continued.
Tom accepted it and said
Mike nodded

Chapter 2

Tom looked through the side window. He never understood how anybody could be willing to live here. The dirt
He never understood how such a stinking cesspool might be called the Big Apple. 

He watched the scenery in the Taco Bell windows on the other side of the road while on the radio Beyonce was singing about what a crazy bitch she was. An older man sat behind one of the windows
A monstrously fat and bald woman was chewing on a bite of what looked like a chicken leg with her mouth opening like a dying fish. Two young boys, were talking using their hands more than their mouths. Tom was not sure if those two were homeless junkies or just another bunch of fucking hipsters.
Tom sighed and wished he were still a smoker. 

The door of the Taco Bell, and his partner Mike stepped out, holding a paper bag in each hand. Mike stopped at the curb and lifted both hands to his head and put his index fingers in both of his ears.
In an explosion of light and sound three police cars
Mike grimaced
He headed to the passenger side and knocked.
Tom looked at him
He stretched out his thumb and pinky and waved horizontally
Mike shrugged and gave Tom an annoyed look
Everything clear.
Tom pressed a custom button on the dashboard
Mike opened the door

“I can hear the sand in your vagina” he said
Tom hated that testosterone-talk
“That’s not sand
Mike pulled out an envelope with a list of addresses and asked “So
Tom let out a little air through his nose and said “After the next lift
He started the security van and pulled out into the slow traffic.
Mike squinted his eyes and tried to find the address. 
“What
If Tom was lucky, nibble their fast food and end their tour without too much vocabulary lifted from the gutter.
But Mike seemed to be warmed up now and began “No sir, and guess what?”
Tom said nothing and discovered why the traffic was so slow.
Around 60 yards in front of them
He thought that it was impossible to clean that city
“Yeah” Mike continued “I finally got lucky.” 

Tom was concentrating on the traffic, drivers began to sound their horns and swerved pointlessly when seeking possible places to overtake the cleaning van.
Mike was unstoppable now and droned on “She isn’t young or a classic beauty
As the road opened a second lane
Tom also pulled out
He ignored the furious protests and sped up.
Mike grabbed the door handle and said “Woah Dude

When Tom passed the orange cleaning truck
Tom blinked
Tome wrinkled his nose, they sure will get this place squeaky clean with that patented mixture of hot chocolate and dipshit!”.
Tom thought it smelled more like a chemical solution
The traffic sped up
“Anyway
Tom gave him a salute and a weak smile and said “Good boy
Mike grinned
Tom lifted his eyebrows and thought that Mike for sure not planed that double entendre.
Mike, I guess I am lucky”.
Tom smiled at Lucky Mike

All 4 of the characters are in their mid 30s but what if one character was in prison from 20-24 years old and that story can contributed greatly to the way the viewer sees the character. Do I shift to 1st person for the prison character as he's reliving it? Do I have my main character transition and foretell at the end of a chapter... ""Darren was a different story

I guess I'm afraid of having too much telling of a story vs showing of a story. If you need better examples let me know.

He swallowed, it doesn’t come back,” the old thegn told him over and over. “Your mother’s gift to you.”

“You mean the battles between House Rivers and House Sandlake? Ten years past? Lord Tomas Rivers won when my father added his numbers.”

“Did he?” she asked without much emotion in her voice. “That is nice. Does he like his lake?” The question made Paul frown and look away. “His youngest son drowned in it

The interior of the farm house was small and made smaller by racks built into the walls meant for storing food for humans and feed for animals. There seemed to be much more of the latter than the former. She found him a seat on a bag of wheat that was half gone. It was soft but he still groaned as his weight shifted. Once he was settled she disappeared into another room and shut the door behind her, he could hear the slow drip. *What am I doing here? I need to get back. I need to…*

Paul didn’t know what he needed to do. He didn’t even know what he wanted to do. If went back they’d know him for a coward. If he disappeared they might have thought him killed or captured. Capture would mean his father would send more soldiers to get him back and war would erupt between the two Houses. *Would my capture or death mean more to my father than coming home alive?*

She came back then with a broken spade. The metal head of the tool was gone

“What do you mean to do with that?”

She gave him an amused look. “My name is Tani. If you are a noble,” she said, hefting the wooden haft. “I had me an idea about getting that mail off. Now hold out your arms as best you can.”

She helped him to stand again and slid the spade handle through an iron ring that was embedded into the wall. He realized he was standing between two of them and knew what she meant to do. He held out his right arm and she slid the handle through the sleeve and behind his back. Already he felt the weight of the armor come free of his right shoulder and he tried to raise his left but the pain was too great.

“I can’t,” she said, slipping the handle through the neck of his mail and looped the other end through the second ring.

However in my attempt to build some mystery

=========================

**Prologue**

It was so much like home. 
	
Of all the posts
	
The previous rulers of this world had nearly destroyed it. It was just as the ancient ones had predicted...  the price for advancement was always the destruction of nature
	
As a mass extinction exploded across the place of their birth
	
This place is not supposed to be a threat anymore
	
The Earth is wondrous when seen from afar, and browns. Slowly the world turned below, passing what was once called North America. A green blip appeared on the screen, highlighting the proposed target. The evidence had been assembled. An attack of this nature required the approval of not only those at strategic command, but the field officer required to press the button.
	
The package opened automatically
	
The display of The Earth enhanced to show a bustling but primitive town. Huge piers jutted out into a well protected harbour
	
The file read:
	
“Several human factions previously unknown for large scale cooperation have now begun regular dialogues and projects out of the commercial hub known locally as 'Northport'. On the surface
	
Conclusion: the power structure of the human settlement is attempting to bring about the prophecy. To view the intelligence gathered for this conclusion select...” 
	
A dimly lit room appeared with seven humans seated at a small table. Three males and four females. All but one were plainly dressed
	
“The signs are all in place
	
A woman answered, we need to cooperate more. We are walking a fine line with how large this town has gotten, but its infrastructure has become necessary...” 
	
The file closed. The rest was of little interest. Human politics even at its most advanced level was a waste of time. The screen zoomed in further on Northport
	
“In the time of peace and broken dreams, mothers will not know their daughters, and all of their bellies shall be full. Few will know want, but all will know desire. When The Builder of Armies unlocks the gates of the great mystery, his path shall become no more clear, and those who follow him will know fear and death and hunger and toil, but their fires will light the path forward. For the forest is full of trees
	
The monk gestured wildly as he spoke, Adepts, Farmers, Hedonites, Fisherfolk, even monks... we must all work together.” 
	
It lowered the audio. It had heard enough. Knowledge of the law is one thing. Abuse of it is another. It needn't see anymore. The Human side of the prophecy was disturbing and violent in nature, but this demanded an extended display.  The volleys natched and whooshed as they fired, exploding outward as glowing red balls of flame. 
	
It re-activated the audio on the monk's sermon
	
“Brother
	
The monk turned and looked upward.
	
“No.” The monk said
	
The sounds of the weapon impacting the surface gave a loud roar and hiss
	
Nothing remained. Smoke and steam rose high
	
Before long its view approached the sunset, like those of the mountains. One red light shined brightly from its center, gleaming outward. A reminder for all to see: we are watching, we will care for you, and we are never going away.

It was unexpectedly easy to break into the Archival Section and to avoid the guards on my way to Storage 2D. My heart is pounding

Despite being trained to have deft hands

I&amp;rsquo;m reaching for the doorknob when I hear soft voices in the corridor. I freeze &amp;mdash; the Pauldrons aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to make rounds inside the Section. Do they know I&amp;rsquo;m here? Have I been set up?

Someone twists the knob from the other side as the beam of a flashlight illuminates the crack beneath the door, but somehow they can&amp;rsquo;t hear my heart. Cold sweat wells inside my gloves as I try to calm myself by repeating that at least I won&amp;rsquo;t die an ignorant. They&amp;rsquo;re now across the room, their backs to me, and I have less than a finger snap. 

Breathless

He didn't know it but a lot of his inebriation was placebo.

The butterfly effect, everything that happens to you affects what happens to you eventually. That’s common sense. So then perhaps when something out of the ordinary happens, it’s not so strange that events following it aren’t the same. It could be as simple as a change in the way you think. It could be that you have to drop the kids off at school now because your husband died. When the initial event occurs, your life after that is potentially altered. When your husband dies, it’s no surprise that you have to deal with the day-to-day things that he used to do. 

In the summer following my freshman year of high school, I frequently opted to stay home instead of going skating or bowling or dancing again. So at about midnight, I was at home reading. 

I’d been attempting to finish my summer reading assignment so I could pass the book along to a friend. I’d been downing glass of tea after glass of tea trying to get through the book. I had dishes all over my floor from living in my room trying to finish the book. As any book I’ve ever been required to read, I expected at least my little brother whose room was right next to the bathroom to come check, but nothing. I stood and shook my head to see if I had a headache. Nothing. So after leaning on the wall for a second to regain my balance, I went into the bathroom, peed like I needed to and went back to my room. 

Everything was normal. The book I’d been reading was closed on my dresser where I always left it. My room was in the tidy shape I usually kept it. I turned my television off and went to bed. 
The next day I awoke at 2:30 in the afternoon. That was strange considering I had an alarm set every day to wake me up at 6:42. Not to mention

I took it for what it was. I mean

At around six o’clock, and yelled at me to get up, that we’re getting water, just like he usually did. So just like I usually did, I complied. I got out of bed and put pants on and off we went. I didn’t think a thing of it until we got back home.

 We lived in west Texas and the tap water tasted like a swimming pool, the weather. This was July in west Texas. It was in the upper 90s every day, and it never rained. However, when I went out there, it was 60 at most and the sky… I can’t think of a way to describe the sky except for that it looked like a combination of every type of weather we ever got there at once. All the different kinds of clouds, all different shades of blue, there was wind, but I thought nothing of it? 

So we filled up the water jugs and returned home and I went back to bed to read. I looked at the clock. 6:34. I read two pages and looked back at the clock. 9:02. Again, I got up, I had some toast, I did my usual morning routine, I go extremely bored of my book and got up and danced, I listened to The Quiet Man soundtrack, I took a bath, and now here I am. Okay

I didn’t bother to check and see if The Quiet Man was on top of Days of Future Past (the only album I ever dance to) in my pile of LPs. I just turned the light out and went to bed.

My life went on. No big deal. I never did finish the book, yes! I even remembered auditioning for first period band! I spent my summer worrying about if I’d made it! Oh well. I liked the band all together in one period anyway. I was dreading the separated band thing. 

We did morning practices, it seemed incredibly uninspired and I swear we used the exact same visuals we used last year. I just figured the guy who drew the dots got into drinking or something. 
I guess I made it through sophomore year, I must have graduated college with either journalism major or an English major. 

I went home from work one day. Nothing out of the ordinary. Whether it had ever happened before or not

I made it home. Home? It felt like it was supposed to be home, that I didn’t have any recollection of doing, but for now, I was perfectly content. I went into the kitchen and started cooking. Soon, the front door opened and a familiar man walked in. Oh, Robert! I’d had the biggest crush on him. Seeing him then, as I remember

I don’t recall us speaking

I suppose life went on as normal again after that. How would I know? Looking back

It was dark and rainy. It was seven o’clock. Robby ought to be home any time now, being left handed, I was told by everyone that I couldn’t knit. Of course, that thought didn’t come until later. Suddenly, someone knocked at the door. I carefully put down my project and walked to open the door. Soaking wet police officers. 

“Are you Edith Zimmerman?” the officer asked. 

I nodded my head. 

“Wife of Robert Zimmerman?”

Again

“Robert was in an accident. We need you to identify the body.”
I felt nothing. I wasn’t sad. I didn’t miss him. I didn’t even feel bad about that. 

I looked down and sighed. 

“Ma’am?” the policeman asked.

I looked up at him. He was holding out a sheet of paper. I took it in my hands. It was handwritten. It looked like my own handwriting did in high school.
 
“Edie

The last thing that happened was that I looked up at the police officer again. And then… well, struggling to open my eyes. 

A much older version of my mother and father were wiping tears from their eyes. They were telling the doctor that they’d decided it was time to pull the plug. The doctor nodded his head and walked to the bed I was lying in to check on me. He saw that my eyes were open and seemed very excited. He summoned my parents over. My mother started crying even more and my father just looked at me in awe.  
 
I didn’t understand. This was a different feeling. It didn’t feel like I was supposed to be here

I waited on the edge of the Rabbit Hole

On that precipice of fate

Destiny was calling out to me.

But still I stood

I was still the child I had desperately tried to run from.

The towering Goliaths of metal and glass. 

The endless corridors of concrete and poverty. 

The overcast skies

An ominous hatred stirred in the air.

The ambiance of shit was strong.

This was New York. Home sweet home.

My apartment faced the Hudson, bright with lights, but quiet.

That first night

Christ

My mother

The doctors

They all made me scream.


I found a job at a local coffee shop
The owners fed me and treated me well. I guess, jaded, washout wannabe.


I went for walks for hours on end

I saw many things.
Prostitutes.
Dealers.
Murders. 
Robberies.

The streets ran red with blood and the poison that was our world made that red run deeper and faster.

I was just a humble observer, letting this dark animosity pass before me like the tide along a beach. It pushed and pulled, and I stayed out of the current. But eventually, everyone wanders too far into the swell.

There were five of them.

They pushed me. They beat me. They broke my wrists. They shattered my pride.

Blood ran in the streets.

Tears streaked my face.

I begged for them to stop. I pleaded for mercy.

They laughed

The pain was nauseating. I couldn't feel. I couldn't see. I couldn't hear.
Please

Let it end. Please.

There was a bright light and I reached for it. It curled close to my chest

A warm blanket of solitude enveloped me. 

I fainted.


I couldn't help adding my blood to the soap and water concoction. My wounds were still fresh

But I ignored all this.

I dabbed the cloth into my bucket and started busting. No had noticed the faint red tint of the tables. Yet.

But no one cared. 

People ate their egg omelets. 

People drank their shitty coffee. 

People paid their bills and left for work. 

Life continued normally

I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I didn't talk. 

I was just that fucked up druggie. 


I came out of an empty dream

It was midnight and I had taken a seat in a nearby booth, an unknown entinity.

I opened my eyes and raised my head

I winced in anticipation.

But no

She was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen. Her simple curves. Her flowing

She gave me a look of sorrow

We were silent for a moment

""Hi

""Hi

""I've seen you around here before.""

""I work here.""

""Yeah,"" she began, then paused, lowering her eyes, ""You do a pretty shitty job.""

I was still mesmerized by her beauty

More silence. 
She was trying to figure out what to say

""You-""

I broke in.

""Hey.""

""What?""

""What do you want from me?"" 

She looked taken aback. Straightening

""I want to talk to you.""

I stared

Her blue eyes flashed in the light and my stomach turned inside out. 

What was this feeling?

""Here I am

""I'll be here every night

""Why?""

I could see her hiding something

""Because you seem like you need someone right now

From here

""What's your name?""

""Emily.""

""Kyle.""

Fuck it.

I jumped.

I stepped from the shadows and raised my weapon. They looked at me

I cut the foreplay short and she ended up staying for the show. 

They were both sitting on the bed to the master bedroom. Her eyes were wet with years. His were calm and dangerous. 

The view from his window was not spectacular, quaint. The Brooklyn Bridge was illuminated in the twilight of dusk, giving the scene an aire of serene beauty and grace. I took a breath of the crisp, winter's air and felt a sense of relaxation as the fresh air washed over me. I felt a rejuvenation of life. I paced back to the couple.

""What do you want

I tapped the barrel of my pistol against his head.

""You.""

""Please, no, I beg you, let us be,"" the woman started to wail; her cries wouldn't stop, and they were joining to the voices, which were now a dull ache in the back of my head.

Mr. Clark was nothing but a businessman
And that silver spoon had been stuck up his ass since birth. He had surfed the green tide of wealth skillfully, that wave too big to surf was heroin.
When he recovered
Slowly
His speeches rang with euphoria. With passion. He reminded the people of what they had forgotten long ago. Hate. Persecution. Distate for any Interlopers in the status quo. These notions
Soon enough
He was more popular than the President.
He was the John Lennon of cable TV.

Mr. Clark sat across from me in a similiarly styled sofa. He carried an almost swagger of ease about his person. Not a bead of sweat was seen resting on his brow. He looked a tad worried, where I was resting in the shadows, and shut the door with a resounding slam. He was alone because he didn't allow security within his home for privacy.

Would I visit her home with the cracked blue paint? I can imagine walking to that red door, and never fully committed, instead shambling up to the home like the walking dead fueled only by the drive of nostalgia and the ill-placed hope that I could go back.

It tasted like a mixture of powdered milk and fertilizer, he raised the clay vase to his lips, and drank.
He spat a generous amount into the fire
 
When I began this journey
He’d approached me during thanksgiving dinner the year prior. He told me that he had a strong sense of imbalance when we had first shook hands upon his arrival
 
My wife and I had been happily married for the better half of a decade, the few arguments we had gotten into, were futile in meaning.
Both of us had a steady income
 
Yet, that- to this day, I still can’t quite decipher whether or not what came to pass was self-fulfilling prophecy.
 
As I drank down the husk
“Action shapes destiny”, thought shapes action”. As I pondered the implications of what I’d just heard, he continued on, in order to solidify his message: “And most importantly, to choose to do nothing is still a choice in the eyes of the universe”.
 
I HAD chosen to do nothing; I’d become content with my stagnant lifestyle, stopped learning.
I do not regret getting married, I’d lost everything of the free spirit that I was in my younger years.
 
Once the divorce came, and life outside of work was nonexistent.
 
I’d become a ghost.
 
Except that my grandfather had insisted on keeping contact with me throughout the entire period.
 
I finished the liquid
 
As my stomach embered, almost begging to support my heavy head.
 
I watched the universe give up its nature.
 
I felt as attached to the dead earth at my back, and all at once, I was enveloped.
 
The earth was travelling at a rate that seemed to be adequate with the assumptions made by astronomers of the early eighteenth century
I relished the sensation, in her rocking chair, soothing our newborn back to sleep. Soon, there was nothing but attunement.
 
My vision adjusted, my grandfather spoke. “It’s miraculous, is it not”, I reeled my head to see him, as alive and healthy as I remembered from my childhood. “They believe it’s the womb from which all of life begins; and the one which we return to, when we leave here”. I was stricken. I could remember so clearly this night, this conversation.
 
“But Grandpa
 
In a form of Déjà vu, meant to aid in the foundation of a destiny.
 
As we reenacted this memory
A sense of rejuvenated fire, proving it should never be squelched by such frivolities as life.
 
“My boy, that deep within all of us, is an immortal spark. And that spark carries everything that you have, are and ever will be”. “Like your soul”, I asked.

 “Precisely, always. And with the respect and adoration you show your mother, you shall never forget to show her the same. Through, in and of we live eternally connected by this beauty”.
 
“I wish I understood. I know I do somehow

 “That’s the beauty of the life we’re given, never stop learning”.
 
The thought of my mother began to become increasingly prevalent
 
With a sense of blinding abundance
 
“Get your lazy ass out of bed
“Damn it Mom
“Don’t you dare talk back to your mother like that
 
A hand grabbed my neck as to tear me from my bed
I sat up
 
I tried to stand, and vomited. My entire being felt as though it had been violated and a sickening shake began to take over.
 
I was dying.
 
I crawled back to the rock and fire
None of the others were opening their eyes. I couldn’t breathe, I suppose.
I exhumed a final breath
 
Like centuries, no cosmos. Just darkness.
I tried in every way to focus my vision upon horizons which didn’t exist.
Nothing would bare results
 
As though being pulled through a vacuum, or if there even were a notion, when suddenly, I was stopped dead, staring directly into the naked eyes of myself. Both of us took a step back, and in mirror fashion, analyzed one another, and fell to one side
 
He burst into a spectacle of cosmic regeneration, as powerful as my grandfather’s words, and as innocent as my questions.
 
I broke into tears.
 
My sobbing became a distant sound
Soon they were my mothers. As though she were miles away
 
I did everything I could to get closer to her. She looked just as beautiful as ever
 
She had often called me on such occasions, or overemotional late-life complications.
It became clear to me that these were just about the only times I’d had contact with her during my marriage.
 
I was stricken with an unending wave of guilt, that I’d stopped giving her the adoration and attention I did when I was young.
 
I spent my childhood preventing her from ever finding love of her own, this sudden clarity was sickening.
I resolved to get as far away from myself as possible
 
I caught sight of a photo of my daughter and I
 
They were proud tears. 
 
The still frame of the moment shattered. My disgust was suddenly inundated by the memory of that day
I was lost in a multitude of tides, but her tears resolved, she caught my gaze.
 
She was as lost as I.
 
We shifted our eyes back towards the album
It was in the hospital, I wasn’t around for, being she was just a child. And likewise, a few were especially significant between just us two. It didn’t matter, we shared them all as though it could have been anyone.
 
Before he passed, but also knew how I’d handled everything following the divorce. I’d done little in the way of making sure to keep a strong relationship with my daughter, and was deep in a well of complacency.
 
“Doing nothing is still a choice in the eyes of the universe” was the last advice he’d handed me before his hands went limp
My eyes opened momentarily
 
As I tried to figure my surroundings, I’m not going to be late, don’t worry!” Instantly, I felt inclined to intervene. As I began to threaten her allowance, I realized that there was no one but the almost-dead embers of the campfire to heed my threat.
 
The sun broke through.
 
As I tried to stagger to my feet, we reached the shore.

I looked away from the clock and towards the desk. It was a grand thing, they might have gawped over it to their hearts content, complimenting the owner on such a wonderful piece of furniture. To me it was just a bunch of engraved lines on a desk, a desk that did nothing but hold a laptop and some pieces of paper on top of it. Behind the desk was the man whose mouth the words were coming from. Unlike the desk, there was nothing magnificent about him. A tall, slim man with a stern face, topped with a tightly cropped set of balding grey hair and a pair of thin wire glasses that barely covered his cold

“Listen, stayed awake, then I could surprise you. Believe it or not, my advice does actually work; you only have to pay attention.”

What was this man talking about? What was I doing with him here in this boring room? I racked my brain for an answer, a boring view for a boring room. I eyed the man’s face. He was looking at me contently, as if he was trying to work out what was going on in my head. I’m afraid that even if you could see into my mind, it wouldn’t hold an awful lot of valuable information, I thought, I can scarcely remember what I ate for supper last night. In fact, I can’t even remember where I was last night.

I went to move my head into my hands and heard a soft clinking, and they were fastened tightly. Hah! Well, this is definitely a revelation in this puzzling tale. Did I get too drunk last night that I can’t remember anything, and that I got arrested? I chuckled quietly. Surely it wasn’t often that someone wakes up in this situation. It was a funny thought.

“Something funny?” the man asked sternly.

I looked up from man hands and up at the man. His eyes seemed lifeless, never taking his eyes off of me.

“Could be

It hadn’t meant to come at as cold as it did. I felt the iciness of the words on my tongue as the man shifted forward in his seat

“Austin, pressing further into the depths of my head.

“No.” I answered, I have been a naughty boy. So my best guess is that you are some cheap lawyer that I have been provided with in order to protect my innocence. What is it that I’ve done wrong? Public disturbance, did I get into a fight, smash something on the street, or swear at a police officer? Please enlighten me on the vile breach of the Constitution that I have committed.”

The man simply socked his head upward and sighed. It wasn’t a frustrated sigh, or doctor, whichever you prefer. I tend to believe that the word doctor is easier on the tongue. Can you remember at all why you would have any need for a psychiatrist? Try to think, Austin, think hard about it.”

I stared at this… doctor with a sense of disbelief. What would I need a psychiatrist for? Why would I not remember anything? Would I have known my name was Austin if he had not have brought it up? My brain swam with questions, it was a puzzle that only contained half of the pieces, and the pieces that were provided were all from a different set. Nothing made sense, the room, the desk, the doctor and the handcuffs. The confusion began to grow, and then I began to panic.

I stood up and walked over to the wall behind my chair. My head began to pound violently, who was he again? He was shouting loudly, telling me to take a seat. The pounding in my head became faster. Harder. I felt a trickle of blood run down my nose, hearing it make a small splashing noise as it hit the ground. Why was I bleeding? Was the information I was searching for so dearly finally leaking out of my head? I reached up and touched my forehead. I rubbed the warm pool of thick blood that had appeared there.

I wondered how it had gotten there. I turned around instantly regretted it. The sudden movement made my head swim, trying to push the assailants away from me. Why was the man not helping me? Didn’t he say he was a policeman or something? Or was it a salesman? No, no. I think he was a lawyer. I felt myself falling. I was falling slowly, with the two men still gripping me tightly. My head hit the ground, and I thrashed around trying to get back up. One of the blurry figures pulled out a long slender looking object, and looked at it carefully. I felt tired, and lay on the floor limply, and then it pressed into me. I felt a shot of some sort of liquid being injected

“It’s all right

It took all the calm she had left to step into the room and stand before them. Each of them looked as old as the Governess

“Young lady

Aderyn stood there, not knowing what else to do, dropped into curtsy. It was a mistake but she realized it too late. The action was absurd in the jumpsuit and these people did not take kindly to being greeted like nobles.

“Oh get up

“Aderyn, but one she couldn’t take back now. *I should have made up a name then! Something they wouldn’t know!*

“Do you have a family

Groundlings often had a second name, not simply those given title and birthright. She thought quickly and shook her head. “No, they… they just called me Aderyn. My mother died,” she said, deciding the lie was easier if it was true. Her breath caught then, as if saying the words out loud made them so much more powerful. She was dead. Her brothers were dead. Kendrick, the only man aside from Ian to show her any kindness. Dead.

“It’s all right, her hands held to her mouth as she struggled to breath through great, gasping sobs. She sank to her knees, all the exhaustion and anguish and shock from the past day hitting her all at once. “I’m sorry!” she said, shouting to her mother, her brother, the Queen, but only the groundlings heard.

“Don’t apologize, be a good lad.”

He did and after a time she was felt something like control take hold. She stood on her own then and, it was how she escaped the worst of Caden’s attentions. Her oldest brother found her status as a Null disgusting, so she often wove stories that led him astray. She was never where he believed her to be. It saved her.

“My mother was brought in to serve the Lady Erisan on Hyperia but she was so pretty, but on the Hyperion’s starkeep. Lord Ian, who was brother to my mother’s lady, always treated me well.”

Aderyn saw them shift uncomfortably in their seats and she added, it was a gilded cage. Too pretty. I never got to go anywhere, just my little room and the cubbies for fetching wine.”

For a time, anxious tremors in her stomach and grew until she felt bile in her throat. The five conversed quietly and she lowered her head, eyes shut.

“They always do this

She glanced at him and he offered one of those lopsided smiles again. To her horror

They turned toward her slowly but as they did

The two young men with weapons were on her in an instant. Giving a shout of protest

“Stop it!” Resh said. “I promised we’d help her!”

“There’s too much risk

“Aderyn! It’ll be okay!” Resh said. She heard him fighting to come after her, intending to bolt despite the futility of it. A door slammed in her face and she pounded on it, screaming to be let out. Only silence answered her.

As she bloodied her knuckles and screamed out one last lungful of fetid, metal floor and pulled her knees to her chest. What happened? Did they see through her lie? Frustration replaced fear as she sat there, the small room illuminated only by a single light on the ceiling. She stood and paced before finally sitting on the cot, the only piece of furniture in the room besides a protrusion in the wall that Aderyn took for a toilet.

Well, painful breath. *As long as you don’t panic, you’ll find a way out of this.* She covered her face with her hands, shutting her eyes and let all thought, all feeling drain from her like water down a drain. If living with her mother did nothing else, it taught her how to be calm in the middle of tense situations. Nearly every interaction with her mother was tense.

So she waited.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1d1zmu/the_blood_part_11_serial_space_opera_novella_any/

To strike one of the Blood when you were not one was an act punishable by a public whipping and humiliation. She knew that, her dignity would remain.

She stepped back and pushed passed him, she found the airlock and went through it, out into the open air of Zennir.

At first she did not realize what she’d done

Looking over her shoulder, a halo of shimmering blue-white surrounding her. If I go back, I’ll die. She knew that, and she also realized that she was breathing air. Zennir air. It tasted sweet and fresh and smelled of grass and hot ozone from the ships.

And in the distance

She looked towards the battlefield in time to see lines of groundlings charging one another, singling out enemies they could more easily run down. She saw Redrick then, though he looked like the rest of them, she knew him. He turned his head and looked at her. They were nearly a league apart but she looked for his eyes.

“I’m sorry

Then another group of groundlings entered the fray. They appeared to have come from the forest beyond. The knights on both sides seemed confused. And then there was a flash of light and an explosion of earth erupted beneath Redrick’s steed.

Aderyn was breathless, his body came apart spilling blood and Ether and viscera. She screamed and screamed and screamed.

There was suddenly no more air, as the shock of the death and destruction came over her, she thought the grass was cool and wet and felt so unlike sand and hair. Wonderous. It was wonderous.

Knights and Steeds exploded, her family died. Groundlings broke and ran, some joining the newcomers, others fleeing into the wooded areas beyond the field.

She felt her chest catch fire. Air, not wanting to die like this, not here amidst this horror. She caught side of Redrick’s helm rolling across the grass, shining and pulsing with dying, white light. A memory flashed: Redrick shoving that helm on her head, making her laugh wildly. “My little sister, so brave little sister!”

He’s dead.

The thought jarred her back

And then the battle was turning, Groundlings she inferred as they wore no masks, pushed them back in a wave with their terrible weapons lighting up the space between.

Her vision was becoming fuzzy and dark at the edges. She heard the shouts through muffled ears, caressing her like gentle fingers.

And then they were on her.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ap3pt/the_blood_part_6_a_serialized_space_opera_novella/

Knights rode in on their metal steeds, but she did not look for him.


House Querra had arrived as well. Their Ether was a brilliant green. She saw a dozen knights on their steeds


I will never marry even a steward. Even stewards must power a keep's lighting.


“Have the groundlings arrived yet?” The voice startled her and she bit back a squeak of fright. All that escaped was a sharp breath and she covered it with a hand. When she turned


Aderyn was not a short woman but most men towered over her. This one seemed merely a child


“I'm sorry?” she asked


“M'lord... m'lord, no m'lord here. You must be Aderyn Medani mm?” He pointed at her back. “Only Null in the place.”


She felt her cheeks grow hot


“Yes, the dress does suggest you're a tad on the thin side but with children that will change.”


Aderyn refused to look at him, I would like to know that your voice is pleasant to hear. Do you sing? You must have some talent at the least?”


She felt so stiff she could hardly move, all the time. No other men smiled at her the way he had. The memory of his smile loosened her joints enough that she could take a step back and look at him.


“Ah


“I sing, and the last fairly well. I read and write and can recant the ancient epics as well.”


The young man smirked. “So you're intelligent. Not always a sought after trait in a wife but since you're a Null I can look passed it. Tell me


Aderyn felt her cheeks grow hotter still and her jaw clenched tightly. How dare he. The Seductive Teachings were a private matter


“Good


Aderyn managed a nod, whom he must surely be, nodded absently to himself. “Very good, plenty of time then. You will, of course, not be my only lover. I will have others, as you would expect. You will treat them as they deserve


He rose then and tilted his head


His fingers closed around her chin and brought her face around so their eyes met. They were of a height and behind those spectacles of dancing lights, broken thing in a bed of birth blood and despair. 


His breath touched her cheek as he leaned close. “Your mother informed mine that I could take you for a test run during the War should I wish it. Perhaps... yes, slid between her legs. He groped her through the fabric of her skirts and she could not help herself.

No need to complain.

But pain is a blessing

Or so I've been told.

Suffering through hardships

Makes one wise until old.

But I do not foresee

Me reaching old age.

Drowning in obsession

and it pays me my wage.

But its payment is scarce.

Nothing but a tease.

Every source of my pride
An effect of disease.


And there lies the problem.

How can I recover

Her toenails scraped on the wooden floors as she made her way to the bed. This was the one place where she didn’t feel the weight pressing on her. The bitter taste that came with that morning’s events became soft and rounded here. She felt her heart rate slowing

It had stopped snowing when she woke up, somewhere on that damn bike again. Together they had fallen twice in the snow. It was embarrassing the first time, and nearly tragic the second time. The falls had shaken her, and made her look at the bearded man differently. She hated to hear him apologize, picking at the scab just made it worse. And besides, it was too late for any of that. The horses ripping though her would see to that.

The bike stopped at the usual place across from the zoo. The cold was biting, but today something was different.  When the door closed behind her and the bearded man released his grip, the women were dripping with focus. Something was wrong. She felt a needle go in. Hold her still one of them said. And then it was over. 

The bearded man never liked making small talk. And waiting in the vets office for your dog to throw up is no time to make an exception. 3 minutes of silence was broken with the sound of her dry heaving. It cost 60 euros to make your dog throw up.  The Belgian girl apologized for leaving her bag unattended and allowing the small dog to eat her epilepsy pills.

This is the very first piece of fiction I've written since the forced journal entries we had to write in elementary school. Having said that



Chapter One

Padre Miguel, only those who have walked barefoot down a rocky path. His words did not resonate with him then and it would take ten years’ worth of bloody footprints for him to understand the significance of his message. 

Jesus Galvan had never been the type of child who asked for what he wanted. Even in infancy, in school, when his friends would gather outside during the lunch hour and take out their toys and marbles from their brightly colored backpacks, Jesus would never join, being fully aware of the emptiness of his own bag. 

Not even when he found himself being chased by Mario

Jesus ran with Mario trailing right behind him. One miscalculated step and he knew that he would be on the floor with welts on his back the size of coins. They ran past the mercado that was bustling with women out buying food for their husbands and children. Jesus knew that if that he could make it to the church entrance he would be able to run in. Although only being in school until his 14th birthday

The sweltering nature of the summer Dolores days started to breathe down Jesus’ neck. He was slowing down and the familiar feeling of his tightening lungs was beginning to consume his every thought. He fought with every inch of his resisting body to keep running. To keep running away from Mario and to keep running towards the church of the Santo Nino de Atocha. His breath kept getting shorter and more audible as panting turned into wheezing and wheezing became gasps for air. 

This is it

The crushed gravel that had gathered at the edge of the street tore across his cheek as his face hit the dusty road. His blood left a streak of bright red that contrasted frightfully against the ashen grey of the floor below him. Every attempt to draw in air was met with rejection and when he reached around to grab his inhaler that was in his back pocket  he felt the force of Mario’s weight on the back of his hand.

“Que paso?  Did  you really think you could run away? Jesus

It took everything that Jesus had to turn his heard around to meet Mario’s voice. From this angle he could see all the small scars on his knuckles from his many fights around school and peeking under his rolled-up school shirt were small circular burn marks along his forearms. Mario followed his gaze towards the scars and pushed his sleeve down while adding more of his weight on the Jesus’ arm that was pinned behind him. 

“What do you have there Jesus?” Mario sneered as he snatched away the inhaler from his grasp. 

“Oh

Doubt must never immobilize your goals
 
It is the sense of the self that should motivate regardless of the nonsense buzzwords crafted to placate your sense of accomplishment. Whether or not everyone can benefit from this frame of mind I find myself in is yet to be seen, one that many might interpret as an excuse to stop challenging themselves. It is a word that one has to be exceedingly wary against so as not to fall victim to its influence.
 
 Whatever happened to rigid and unapologetic criticism? When exactly did our institutes for learning fall in step to the apologetics rhythm? I just do not find it a helpful lesson to cater to mediocrity and then display it alongside a true seminal literary work. No, but do not attempt to put a pig in a dress and expect me to call it a beauty queen. Potential, as it exists today, is a non-answer, a red herring that can help only the upkeep of appearances and pride. I do not stand on the side of half-truths and false affirmations when dealing with flawed works of any kind. And I refuse to be led down a path laid out for me by some hidden word called potential, but instead make my own.",,,,

I don't know if this will work properly but here is a google doc link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gF-xpn4NPblFsbbIyDMdMf4gn5J5noNoXH6PD0h3qNw/edit

	He awoke to the calming sounds of the river’s water lapping the shore.  A peaceful sound.  How did I get here?  He thought.  He crawled out of the river’s grasp onto a large smooth rock to collect his thoughts.  The night sky appeared serene despite the orange glow in the distance.  How far off is that?  Looks hellish.  He thought as the ringing in his ears subsided.  Where am I?
	As his hearing came to he could hear screaming.  Not the screaming of people, was fire.  The city nearby was burning and under attack from the sky.  Large military aircraft dropping ordinance.  Napalm. High explosives. Something was seriously wrong.
	He scrambled to his feet to survey the immediate area.  Not a person in sight
	Slowly getting to his feet on the slippery rocks
	“Oh shit!” he yelled at the top of his lungs out of surprise.  “That sure as hell wasn’t natural.”  He made his way closer to shore.  Actual dirt.  He felt as if it had been a long time since he felt something that wasn’t sand.  He leaned against a tree to check his pockets.  
	Ok, a Kevlar jacket with a spent round in his chest, a pair of dog tags, but too dark to read, and a large combat knife.  No food, but I can manage.  I’m military after all, right?
	A frightening gurgling noise made itself known behind him.  He clutched his M9
	“Who’s there?! Speak up or I’ll shoot!” He yelled
	The gurgling being from his left shows itself and lunges at him drooling, bleeding through the eyes.  Four rounds left.  “Holy fuck! Get off!” he yells panicked.  He pushed the first being off, scrambles to his feet and looks for the next.
	Aiming straight ahead again
	He nervously punches at the magazine release missing numerous times.  Ten more feet, and fires as the being trips over a root.  The second one lets out a blood curdling yowl as it twitches and slides towards his feet.  It stops moving as pitch black liquids spew out the back of its head.  The solider readies himself for the last one.  The last one has gone quiet.  To your right, to your right! He yells at himself.
	He pans right with his flashlight excitedly, the last being is lit up like a Christmas tree.  The solider swings wildly far right and fires with his eyes closed until the pistol clicks empty.
	A soft thump.  The being falls at his feet in the dirt.  He slowly opens his eyes and looks at his last victim
	He turns back to the river and dips his feet in, the fires in the distance leave a shimmering orange glow on the water, and then he sees them.  Several bodies, dressed exactly like himself, floating down stream.  One body, missing both legs, screams bloody murder as he swallows a lung full of river water
	The soldier takes off his helmet and vomits into it.  He watches as the city nearby continues to be bombarded with explosives before he passes out.

As Janet squirmed around in the plastic seat to get into a comfortable position for a nap, in part, to get the sticky green piece off his sweatshirt. There was an announcement that the heating system on the train was experiencing some issues and that VIA rail sincerely apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused. An elderly man behind Markus murmured to his wife that he knew they should have just taken a bus. This was what every unfortunate person on the train was thinking. After a quick glance to see if Janet was asleep or not, Markus returned to staring out at the rest of humanity who were forced to battle with the elements outside. Every one of them was visibly suffering from not only the same physical illness he and Janet had, but the similar seasonal depression he was in. Markus had at once discovered on that train ride that he, as an individual, had reached new lows. Before he could even begin hypothesizing what it was he would say to his parents and family, as expected, but she kept clearing her throat and adjusting her position on her the seat. Her head was leaning on his shoulders. 

Markus all of a sudden felt overwhelmingly sorry for the poor girl. So sorry that tears formed in the corners of his eyes. So sorry that if she got up and asked him to move so she could lay on both seats, his fault that his shoulder was too bony and couldn’t provide much comfort for her head. His fault that he had to lie to his parents and Janet before even asking Autumn to come with him for Christmas and then drag Janet all the way up to fucking Barrie so he could lie some more. 

Markus was grinding his teeth now, that things had to turn sour with Autumn. Markus was the one who gladly accepted that she had a husband in waiting and went ahead with their little affair before getting caught red-handed.

1341762990.0,w8322,That untitled thing that Melons chick is doing,MissMelons,10,1,2,"Still no name for this
________________________________________________________________________________________

Flavors of Thailand, it was purely traditional. Sure, the chicken was expensive and as a paying customer it would probably take a lot of the girl’s newly acquired funds but this was a chance in a life time situation. This place always treated her like family, especially after her mother left. The two of them had actually eaten there the day before her mother left her in their hovel. That had been only a few years back and the girl hadn’t really bothered to look for her since then. This place was huge and had many secrets. 

After her mother’s disappearance the owners of Flavors of Thailand always offered the girl a nice discount on food. It didn’t make it any more affordable for a teenager but when she had the money then it didn’t injure her pocket as much. 

As usual, hovels and the persistent cloud of brown that hovered over all of them. Back in her naive days she thought this to be a beautiful view, something that surpassed the artificial sunrises and sunsets of the higher dimensions. Down here, you only got light or dark, you can never really consider them day or night. Such a thing no longer existed here.  

Today’s view consisted of a fast paced Saturday

The Thai restaurant was well known for its dealings in the upper dimensions and were able to get real chicken a lot of the time so the girl knew it was always safe to eat. She recalled a time when she ate a sample of aged artificial fish from a vendor. She had been sick for nearly a week. Good food was a delicacy here.

Outside the window the girl caught a glimpse of an all too familiar figure. She shrank down into her seat hoping that he hadn’t seen her sitting there. Sitting in the window was suddenly an incredibly bad idea, a day in which the girl prided as her day of freedom from this unusual man. Considering his lineage and history he looked incredibly out of place in the slums of this dimension. The girl was sure that he only taught on this level for charity purposes. Education requirements never exceeded the knowledge of keeping the ship running and keeping the robots and dwellers alive. Especially if they lived in the upper dimensions. 

Luck was not on the girl’s side today. Their eyes met and in mere moments he was entering the restaurant. Nonchalantly he took a seat a few tables away from her but was angled so he had a clear view of her every move. The girl disliked this his man, fresh real food and artificial sunlight that actually benefited him. Down here all she had was dirty sewer water, leftover food and the dim glow of the reality of her dimension. Although she strongly disliked this man he was only a couple years older and had proven that he had great generosity for the lowlifes of this place. It wasn’t uncommon for him to feed the entire class lunch or help buy new clothes for those that needed it. The girl has had to thank him several times for some of the clothes she wears. 

The girl’s food was brought out to her table and suddenly the horrible stenches of the street disappeared upon its arrival. The fresh pecans and vegetable medley with chunks of chicken made her stomach holler for its immediate digestion. Slowly, she saw her teacher move. He stood from his table and smoothly sat down in front of her window at her table. The girl couldn’t relate to the large smile that was on his face, as though he had achieved something that no one else had before. She wondered if he had poisoned her, but her stomach was hollering again for more of the Thai cuisine.  One after another spoonful was shoved into her mouth as her teacher watched. Steadily his smile softened but he continued to not say a word. Maybe he had known just how important this moment of eating had been or he could have possibly understood to never get in the way of a hungry girl. 

Only half of the plate had been consumed when the girl decided that she should stop before hating herself. She never wanted to gorge and become gluttonous like the higher dimension people. The teacher slowly reached across the table and took a light sip from the girl’s water

“Mr. Hawkes

Mr. Hawkes stared at the girl hard with his green eyes. He thumbed and played with the perspiration on her glass of water for awhile before finally speaking,” He said quietly, “Before your final year of school, before they drag you off into the work force, I would like to give you the opportunity to join me in the higher dimensions.”

""No."" the girl named Emi said sternly, Mr. Hawkes, it's just Emilia."" 

The two stared at each other for while. Mr. Hawkes didn't suffer from the pale discoloration that everyone had down here. Instead it was the healthy flesh toned color that was evidence from the sun on the higher dimensions. And amongst all the grime of this underworld how did he always manage to stay so clean? After a few more minutes of their silence Mr. Hawkes simply nodded and straightened out his coat before standing up. He tossed a fist full of money onto the table

My great grandfather left his house to his 12 grandchildren when he died. By the time I was born, rusted old harpoons and glass buoys and lanterns. Hanging from the ceiling, near the potbelly stove, was an inflated pufferfish.

A good third of the house was taken up by the game's room, lining the coloured snooker balls and pushing them into each other, that I began to learn of things such as the conservation of momentum, friction,
elastic and inelastic collisions

My first visit there was before I could remember. There is a video of my asking, to the beach so I could play in the sand and the sea. Using the few words that I knew at the time, I succeeded in getting my point across. ""Hand! Hand! Beach!""

The place was sold when I was 12 years old. Out of the 12 people that had a share, and all the wonderful stuff that my grandfather had collected was sold or given away. I got the pool table's scoring board and the stuffed pufferfish.. My parents have a glass buoy.

My parents spent the $50, Venice, Rome, Athens, and a Greek island called Santorini. I still don't know what I would have preferred. I know I miss that place, and I wouldn't have missed a trip to Europe had it never happened.

Screaming from the halls and depths within the tainted halls of this now accursed place the swollen monstrosity that were once it's inhabitants crawled over each other and across the walls, powerful arms numbed from pain by their transformation throwing their mutated husks ever forwards like a plague that devours only to feed an ceaseless hungering that rips at the soul.

They ran.

They pour through the gaping hole that was the doorway to the room of their own transformations. They are greeted with fire and gladly throw themselves into the blaze that it might end the ache in their minds. Steel tipped arrows buzz through the air like hacksaws and cut the creatures down

They ran.

Their victims find help in the ones the creatures use to care for. They are assisted by the once husbands, and friends of the now wreathing swarm. A massive wooden door slams down halting their onslaught with the finality of the grave. The creatures scream and gnaw at the wood, their caustic blood rupturing from their body's with the denial of their desires. They ache and grope at the door like a sex starved lover before hearing the whimpering of what they once were. Turning their attention from their pursuit, they see them, helpless and bound within cages. Just as they are in their own bodies. All is quiet for a moment as lovers and friends see each other again after what felt like a lifetime, recognition kindled as their eyes locked on one another.

**It** is in the fall that he appears

When our paths first crossed

I had told him; then

Elsewhere, and I suspect that he is no ordinary man. He cuts a distinct figure: in his hat which sits crooked at the front, as if a crow is forever staring down the brim of it, and suited in an aristocratic get-up of silk shirt and thick, split coat. And by the Ọ, in such a time (which was not Late-Lore), this would be a Digression upon the both of us. 

“What do you know of Creation?” he’d asked

Outdoors, he’d cried: “the Ọs’ love and blessings upon us all! Might he!” 

Such words had always made me reflexively cringe – in a tightening of my stomach at the merest of proselytising. “I wonder....” I’d said

“That is blasphemy

I might have been drunk, and he had just arrived in town, coming into the bordello as if another gentleman caller. He had simply sat there and watched us girls mill about. Some of us had thought he was choosing, but I had known instantly that he wasn’t. He’d simply sat there and scanned us, pausing only to sip from his wine. 

The rest of the clientele had been sitting apart from him. As packed as the ale-floor had been, he was evenly splitting the more undesirable of the clientele from those who were less so. 

I had –a few months ago- managed to indebt myself to a wealthy businessman, but one which I would – so I’d decided. 

It was one of his boys who approached me that night, gesturing at me to lead him upstairs. As the authoress of my own fate here, I was to let him have his way with me – hold this favour against my debt to the businessman, but *he* must have noticed the boy not passing coins to me in the view of the presiding Mother (the norm in bordellos at the time was to conduct all business in view of the Mother – it isn’t so any longer). 

So, and knew him to be repulsive; so I must’ve appeared less-than-enthusiastic about the affair – that was likely it. 

At the motion of him, he continued to try and push me up the stairs, his hands upon me in a vulgar fashion. 

I wouldn’t have wanted him to interfere in my business with the boy, deliberate steps, I found my own self transfixed by him. Silent as a spectre, he stalked up to us and stopped behind the boy. And the boy, as if sensing him as he stood there –even through the clog in his mind- turned to face him. “Why, hello.” he grinned. “Would you like to come upstairs with us?” 

He gestured at me. “Would you like an hour with this lady here as well?” he asked. 

“How about we say for the night?” the man said, it must’ve been of untold worth. He grabbed it out of the man’s hands, and sputtering and stumbling, he ambled past him and out into the ale-floor – where the clients had returned to their drinking and chatting. 

The man looked at me, with a curt tip of his hat, he smiled and turned back to the floor. 

I’d looked this way and that to see if anyone else was as caught out by his intrusion into my business

Noticing him exiting the establishment

DEAD JOE

They had always called him Dead Joe. His friends called him Dead Joe. The people who grew up with him called him Dead Joe. His co-workers called him Dead Joe. His mom called him Joey. His dad called him Joseph

His flatmate from college, it was a laughably tame affair in which Joe’s car had glided, at less than 5 miles per hour, into the side of a police cruiser) Ryan had joked that Joe couldn’t have possibly made it out of such carnage alive. Joe’s ex-girlfriend Lori - who had gained several pounds and lost most of her youthful beauty in the ten years since they’d dated in high school, much to Joe’s pleasure - called him Dead Joe because he had become “infuriatingly average” and was “dead inside”. Joe suspected this was more because he had constantly turned her down when she attempted to rekindle their old flame than because he had chosen to grow up, cut his hair, and join society as a productive - if unremarkable - member. Yes. They all called him Dead Joe for one reason or another. Not just to his face

I had the dubious honor of being the first to call him Dead Joe after he had actually died. 

I found Joe at fifteen-past-three in the morning outside a coffee shop called A Cup of Joy on a rainy Saturday morning in May. He was shivering, his mouth agape - a scene typical of the newly dead - as he took in the radical new dimensions the world had opened up to him. I knew what he was seeing - what he saw for the first time this night - the world as it appeared to the dead.

Joe could see the coffee shop in front of him still. Beneath that, and the meadow it had belonged to before that. He could see the tree that had been cut down in the Thirties, and the negro boy who had been hung on one of its stronger branches in 1918. He could see the mob that had strung the boy there, and looking at them he could see their parents, and their grandparents, and their children and grandchildren. He saw them as they lived, as they appeared in every moment of their brief lives, the filth that followed them from that day to this.

Dead Joe retched, refused to open his eyes. The production of Joe’s lament would have been shocking in its starkness, beautiful in its epic misery, if only its audience was alive. I, however, remained untouched.

“It’s a lot to take in

Dead Joe ignored me at first. Typical. Selfish. 

“Do you plan to stay here

Still Dead Joe ignored me, his body shaking in despair, his head tucked into his chest. I approached him from behind, knelt by his miserable form and whispered into his dead ears. “Not that it matters much, not anymore. You picked a bad time to die, Joe. You picked a real bad time. Worthless corpse. You missed Heaven by this much.”

He turned his head to face me

“Oh. Heaven is it?” I asked him. “Is that what you hoped would come next, all that us corpses have here is the world we’ve made. The world as its been and as it is today. And you, you careful idiot, you’ll miss out on that as well, I’m afraid.”

Dead Joe had stopped shaking and was now staring at me. His hand absent-mindedly traced the vulgar cut drawn upon his neck. He couldn’t talk if he’d wanted to, until he began to learn how to communicate.

“Ker-iss-ta-ta-tahb-” It was a sharp sound

“Now

“Ker-isss. K-kerissta - Keh”

“Well, you haven’t swallowed a rat. Think in civilized words, if you must think at all.”

“Krista. Kristie. Kris. Kristabel. Krista. Kristie...”

“Yes?”

“Kristabel? Kristabel?”

“Your mate? Afraid she survived the incident Joe. Its just you and I,” although I took precious joy in telling him, “your woman wore her restraining belt and you, you poor idiot, were flung through a windshield like a bag of rice. Oh it was horrible! She screamed Joe! She was so frightened. She’s still frightened. And alone. And you are here with me” I smiled. 

“Kristabel.” pathetic. Despairing. Had he been speaking like the living his voice would have broke and the word trailed off. Instead the thought cut off abruptly as if it were a recording.

“Alive. Very much unlike you.”

“A ghost? Spirit?”

I scoffed at him and replied with derision “A ghost, at least for the short time that remains before none of this matters.”

“Matters?”

“Yes, I’m afraid, and the story itself will make no sense. In short time, Joe, none of this will matter. Our world is changing. You’ve missed it. There’s a storm coming, Dead Joe. The bodies of the dead will soon rise...""

“Z-zombies...?”

I laughed. “You and your words. Zombies. It’s dirt in my mouth.” I made a gesture of spitting on the ground. “The bodies of the dead will rise, Joe, don’t mourn your death. No. There are greater things to mourn now. Look around you, Joe - ” (he didn’t) “ - look at our paradise. You won’t unlock the secrets of this world because you haven’t the time. This world will be gone before your maggot-brain even begins unravelling its mystery. Look at that phantom tree-” (he did) “-look at all you can see there. It takes centuries to understand the millions of layers buried in that one spot. Answers, Dead Joe! Answers to every question you’ve ever asked, buried in our world like precious baubles, begging, will you? Because Dead Joe died too late!” I spat.

“Why - why?” he pleaded.

“Because the bodies of the dead will rise. Even your body, ridiculous puppet of a corpse will saunter around this world like a plague. These abominations will poison every trace of life that this world remembers. All of these layers will be painted over with the dull grey of undead. All the answers I’ve spent centuries learning - well, you won't get your answers. They’ll be gone before it even occurs to you to look for them.”

I could see that Dead Joe was still confused. “Look at that coffee shop. Look beneath it. You see that colored boy hanging dead from that tree? You can see his whole life. You can see him from the day he was born to the day his neck broke in that noose.” and still, as one speaks to a child or a fool: “From the day he was born - to the day he died. His life left this... echo, you might say, an echo that shadowed his life with each reverberation.” Still, Joe was infuriatingly vacant. “What do you think will happen when that child’s body walks again? It will add infinite data to every iteration of his memory. The secrets hidden there will be buried under mountains of nothing. That mob that sentenced him - their bodies will stir as well. The woman watching from her window, the mother weeping down the street. The world of the living will be invaded by the children of the past, and this invasion will abolish the histories written here.”

“We who have wandered this expanse for centuries have done our research. Every question that occurred to us had an answer waiting to be found in the souls of those who have died. All that was required of us was the patience to search for those answers. We are aware of the world in all of its staggering dimensions because we have spent centuries researching. We have become elevated - that is to say we have evolved into superior beings through these pursuits. I have all the answers I will ever need

“You will have nothing. In the time before this vast body of knowledge dries up you cannot hope to gain even an infinitesimal fraction of the truths we know.”

“Why are you telling me this?” His thoughts sounded angry

“Oh, perhaps you would have been blessed with this journey earlier. Maybe you’d have time to learn even the most basic of our secrets, to begin to fathom our complex existences. Maybe then you’d be useful. Maybe it brings me joy to tell you - Dead Joe - Honestly-Literally-Truly-Dead Joe - that you have nothing to offer our community of what you would absurdly refer to as ‘ghosts’. And the walking dead - the zombies, as you say... Well, I suppose you’re the zombie here: Lifeless, purposeless, shambling stupidly

I put my hand on his shoulder, I’m afraid you are not welcome here,” I smiled as the words penetrated. Joe began to weep. He grabbed my arms, begging, pleading, blubbering silently with his torn throat and dead frown. I stood then, shaking him off of me as one does a pest. Joe wrapped his arms around my leg and looked up into my terrible eyes until, he fell away. 

“You’ve very little time, staring into the histories of the world trying desperately to understand the truths buried there. Lucky fool. Dead Joe would never reach the end of knowledge, as we had. He would never find all the answers, only to learn there weren’t that many to begin with, not when one has centuries to search. He would never discover how hopelessly mundane the world was. I hated him for his fortune, his undeserved good luck. 

...and as I thought of the injustice of lucky Dead Joe’s death

----

**CHAPTER ONE | STANCE**
**NIGHT

The clouds stretch to as far as the eye can see tonight. Blotting out stars and moons for the first time since the last rains, the city of Artifice is lit by gaslight – defiant in the face of yet another months-long blackout. 

Groups of Believers are out on the streets already: playing harbingers to the crowd; while troupes of Weathermen scurry to and fro: outfitting buildings for rain. Businesses run quicker than usual under the threat of rain: airships float in and out of the docks in swarms of a dozen at a time, setting off little spits of magnesium-light over the tumultuous waters. 

And in spite of this fog –in the thick of this mass emigration- the great Clock-Tower counts the minutes down to the first of the rains. 

~~additional line break~~

In his business

Presently idling

She’s born of privilege – doctored (once, he has learnt to make up for his shortcomings in other ways. 

When she’s finished with the lanterns, where the city-lights are burning their season-brightest tonight – ignoring him with terrible purpose. 

In the distance, looming dark and thick against the darkness of the Artificial night. They are approaching ever-slower at this time of year – as if teasing all the citizens of Artifice with hope against their terrible rains. 

There was a travelling merchant’s daughter he once knew –whose family had been stranded in Artifice over the monsoons some years ago-, and the Clock-Tower to a mythical warrior, both of whom were fated to be forever locked in that eternal struggle of archetypes: person vs. nature – an apt analogue from those more innocent times, and surely apt to the uncultured mind; but that wasn’t what he, nor his familiars –who numbered among the more cultured citizens of Artifice- saw in their most singular icon. Instead of a legendary warrior braving spirits and demons, the analogue they ascribed to the two legendary figures were that of ingenuity versus tribulation. 

“Who do you think built the Clock-Tower?” she’d asked

He’d shrugged

Could you see this character in a longer story or novel?)",George_Benson,8,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jk2a6/feedback_gas_station_aviators_892_words_character/

Michael wore Tommy Hilfiger shirts and shorts with his sun-kissed Sperry's. He had yellow, and green ones, seersucker, striped, solid, and dotted ones. He thought they made him look devil-may-care. They made him look snobbish. When there wasn't any sun, he hung his sunglasses off the top button of his shirt to flaunt true Italian craftsmanship.

Michael gelled his hair in a supposedly sensual way. On his chin, they giggled mercilessly.

But Michael was proud of that emaciated patch of hair. You have to be proud of everything you accomplish when you don't accomplish much.

Unfortunately, a fact that Michael refused to recognize. His teacher bought him a Dollar Tree medal with a frayed ribbon that read ""You're #1!"" Joy seizing his fingers, he tried to humbly adorn the honor but ended up beaming like the jack-ass he was. In the dull plastic, Michael saw a movie star loved by millions for his philanthropy, a rock legend who cured cancer, and a rocket scientist selling a million copies of his latest fantasy epic, all of which would be child's play for a man of his infinite potential. Right up to the day he moved out

Lack of material didn't stem Michael's bragging. Strutting across the freshly clipped lawns of his private high school, his sprawling mansion, and (the one time his parents refused to spoil him) even his shitty sunglasses. While his perfectly manicured fingernails tapped lazily against the delicate hairs of his chin, he complimented his own beautifully lush hair, his tasteful outfit, and the masculinity of his beard. One time he exercised; he bragged about how fit he was for a week. He boasted of his humility, intelligence, asserting that the only reason he received subpar grades was he didn't give a fuck. Whenever he managed to muster a crowd, and other forms of badassery.

And as part of building himself up, he mocked their modest homes, scuffed cars, and ""gas station"" aviators. Many times during lunch, he spilled milk on another's shirt and told them not to get upset since it probably wasn't worth much anyway. He criticized the nerds for trying too hard, the jocks for being idiots, and the poor for being lazy (like most rich kids

Aside from his reflection, socializing vicariously through Facebook. Wherever he sat at lunch, others left. Whenever he asked about the upcoming party, everyone silenced. When people did bother listening to him, it was with a slight, mocking smile on their lips.

Michael got the picture. He knew no one could stand him. So

But Michael did it all wrong. Since people must know what you've accomplish in order to respect you, respectable look. Or so he thought.

And what started out as subtle actions designed to win the approval of his peers led to mocking. So Michael upped the ante

By high school, cry together, and poke fun at each other while he stood alone with only a nice care and a nice house and too much money. He pined to join them instead of being this self-absorbed asshole, but they would claim it was just another ruse to prove his superiority. Be it rational or irrational, Michael saw the only way forward as digging himself deeper into the grave he had begun in grade school.

So Michael wore aviators that he bought at a gas station. Scratched off the label and told everyone that they were custom built by some Italian guy. Because no one respects a man who wears gas station aviators.

She was pushed out onto the street.

Octavia closed her eyes. The taste of salt entered her lips. Her face looked like the rain on the window that she had looked out of only seconds ago. Before he violently pulled her off of the chair and threw her out.

She pushed herself up now though. Her arms shook as she did and she tried to look up at her husband when she got up to her knees. When she went to speak her voice was gone and she gasped for air between her cries. Hyperventilating she managed to croak

Then her child was thrown towards her. Her heart skipped a beat as she flung herself out to catch her child midair. A groan left her when her back hit the stone of the back alley. A crack was heard from her back. Pain was nothing however in a situation like this

“Hush child, Mommy has you. Yes. Mommy has you,” she said a second time to reassure herself more than anyone else.

Octavia then looked up to where her child was thrown from. Everything was blurry though and she took a second to wipe her tears away. Lian had been crying all the while as she waved her hands around frantically until she found her Mother's neck. Octavia could only stare at her husband though. He was standing in the door-frame with each fist balled up. 

Nothing made any sense to her. How had the times changed so quickly? She could still recall when they had met in the temple. The gut-wrenching feeling that she had followed by the heat rising to her cheeks when she looked away, confident, and handsome. How powerful Marin was with his influence over the temple. Now she only saw Widower Marin. No longer  was he clothed in bishop garments but instead a linen shirt with holes and pants torn down the side. The alcohol could even be smelt a foot away. Octavia still didn’t know the full story behind his excommunication. She use to be shy to look at him out of embarrassment now though she was shy to look at him out of fear. Her right eye still stung from yesterday. 

“I don’t understand. I don’t. I can’t. Why?  Why are you doing this to me?” She cried turning her back to Marin and placing her child behind her. She didn’t know what broke her heart more. The fact her marriage was over or the fact her child's life would be ruined. Octavia couldn’t recall any single parents she had met who raised a well-behaved kid. It was impossible to maintain enough money to raise the child and also be in their life.

“I can’t take you anymore Octavia

She wanted to remind him of how they’d be able to pay the landlord and make sure Lian wasn’t hungry if he didn’t spend every ducat on liquor. Even if she dared she’d only get a word out for his hand lunged at her. His fingers clenched around her throat and they stared at each other in silence as she sniffled. Then she heard Lian shriek and both her and Octavia screamed at the same time

Behind a pile of garbage a rat had witnessed this entire scene. When she saw the woman hit the ground he couldn’t make out the difference between the sound of the door closing and Octavias body hitting the ground. They happened at the same time.

1375379591.0,1jiasy,"Blind Addiction. My first narrative, 1600 words.",ballerberry,7,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1jiasy/blind_addiction_my_first_narrative_1600_words/

Blind Addiction

I know what you’re thinking. I’d never get addicted to that stuff. I have self-control, so maybe I’ll try it. Just this once.
You naïve idiot.

Don’t you think I thought the same thing? That’s always how it starts. Next thing you know you’re labeled a “junkie” by your family and best friends. Sometimes it takes years to end up there

Indulgence happens to the best of us and we have to accept the consequences.

Take it from an addict in recovery. Addiction isn’t what you’d expect it to be. Most addicts don’t realize they’re addicted even after it’s really obvious. Their polluted minds convince themselves they’re “fine” and they can “quit any time they want.” Isn’t it funny how we justify our actions to ourselves? I used to be great at that. But I’m off my high horse now. I thought I was such hot shit. 

Wasn’t I?

Let me guess. You think you’re above addiction, it should...

It’s a vicious cycle. You can start off smoking weed once a week

Eventually you’re drinking and smoking every other day to counteract the aftereffects of the previous intoxication

Getting arrested for shooting heroin doesn’t bode well for a guy’s integrity. I learned that the hard way.
Don’t get me wrong, my decisions, my life. My “faults” and “crimes,” according to the government.

I truly believed I was invincible then. I was the perfect student on the path to success and I’d be damned if some high school dropout police officer was going to tell me how to spend my free time. And was I ever damned.
 
It wasn’t always this way. I used to be sheltered and naïve and judgmental and sober. Once I made the decision to try drugs for the first time, until I had completely forgotten that my victimless crime was illegal. My fear of authority became nonexistent.  I carried some with me at all times, and the word “heroin” triggered about the same emotional response for me as the word “water” might for you.

All my friends did it. We bonded over it. We were finding ourselves
We couldn’t understand why what we were doing was wrong. We weren’t hurting anybody or stealing anything. We were just doing drugs!

It’s easy to hide it

Well I call bullshit. Just because we don’t talk about watching porn doesn’t mean we aren’t all doing it. Seriously, and dads while nobody’s home. I’ve seen it all. Nobody has to know you’re an addict. It’s not always so obvious and dramatic like it is in the movies. There are plenty of fully functional contributing members of society who also happen to be addicted to a substance. In fact, you’re probably one of them. 

Does our justice system not have better things to do than arrest me and wreck my life because I like to get high? This is your money at work. Taxes paid for my arrest and in exchange your kids have to share a desk at school. Where are our priorities? What is the greater evil? Sorry to challenge your unoriginally-stereotyped perception

You’ve heard it a million times: drugs are bad, stay above the influence. What a fountain of garbage you are! I bet you do everything you're told to do. You’ve already made up your mind. You look down on those losers you see in the movies, completely unaware that one day you will soon be just like them.

So start with the justifications, you know. If I was in your place...

So don’t pretend like you know me

Success, authority. It can all be lost in the blink of an eye.

I used to attend Harvard University a couple years back. Shocking I know. I probably could have started with that, go ask professor Addington about his favorite student. He’ll tell you all about me. If that’s not enough, refer to my impeccable grammar and extravagant vocabulary. Impressive, isn't it? Are my warnings credible now? Are you really still in denial? You have a hundred problems in front of you but you can't fix any of them because you refuse to take the first step.

They don’t tell you it happens in college, rich kids all thrown into close quarters probably find drugs faster than anyone else ever could. Doesn’t take long before they get bored and figure out a way to get what they want. Smart people always seem to find a way to get what they want. 

Greedy assholes. Why can’t you be happy with what you have?

I don’t expect to be able to help you. At a certain point it becomes impossible. The spiral keeps moving in a downward direction and outside intervention isn’t always enough to stop it from crashing straight into the ground. Denial is a powerful trick indeed.

I guess I’m just writing this so that you’ll realize when you’re going through what I am that I was right. Fuck you and the way you judge me with those hateful

The thought of it almost makes me want to live. Almost.

So go ahead. Try it. Try it now, not for me. I already know the truth. I invented the truth for Chris’sake. And you’ll come back for more. 

Did you know that if you introduced a mouse to nicotine and then forced it to choose between the nicotine and food
I have a syringe and some fresh heroin all set up and ready to go. Haven’t had any in 22 hours and I’m ready for more. I got a lot this time. It’s supposed to be bomb. 

This is the last time

I guess if I overdose they’ll call this my suicide letter. Hard to believe I still care what they think of me. What you think of me. I went to Harvard

I’ve never tried this much before. I’m a little nervous, well, at least it’ll end on a high note. I’ll spend my final moments laughing at you for being too high in the clouds to realize I’m talking directly to you right now. I was never too fond of living anyways. And it’s got to be done. The heroin isn’t going to inject itself, you know.

Wish me luck.

I'm really curious how much exposition is too much exposition... because I feel like the backstory of the town is as necessary to the development of the story as it is to the general establishment of the voice and tone of the narrator. Any advice would be great.***

This is all true, but there sure wasn’t any outbreak or botched military training exercise. There was a tragedy happened, just not the one that the media reported.

Suppose it all started with a sort of town gathering.
We all stood in the road and watched the wood-panelled station wagon sputter off into the distance

Seeing people off had been the neighborly thing to do, it became a full blown ritual. A gathering, not to say goodbye to our friends and wish them well, but to mourn our own decaying futures. Each occasion was quieter and more sparse than the last. Life had become a game of musical chairs, the music had stopped, and none of the damn chairs were in Rivet Springs. 

Believe it or not, well, rivets. We weren’t founded on creativity, just good old fashioned hard work. The downsizing happened slower than we could notice, until one day we woke up to find our primary export was our neighbors. Now the industrial complex lay rotten and abandoned, taunting us with it’s toothless smile of intermittently shattered windows. The great oxidized skeleton of prosperity itself.

This is what we thought about that day. 

A collective sigh decompressed as we all stood idly about waiting for someone to do something. No one did. The productive had abandoned the town months ago to go do productive things someplace else. 

Time staggered the way it always does in moments of aimless waiting.

“Wish it was mine

Then a quiet tugging at a mother’s hand pushed the first domino. The tension was broken by the honest simplicity of a child

A town meeting was called the following day and, despite not being formally invited. Or even told that there was any such meeting in the first place.

Marty was his first name and not even the town register knew his last. He had no official documentation to speak of. Paid no taxes and owned no land. Took no handouts. The title of “Mister” was granted out of respect for his age

The general mood of the meeting was a bit more tense than usual. 

“Now, tugging at his pants pockets and shifting his weight from one foot to the other. He stood at the microphone in place of Mayor Williams. The good mayor was pursuing a middle management position somewhere outside of Pittsburgh. So much for the captain going down with his ship.

“Now what we all spose’d to do?” ejaculated Greg Jones. “Sit ‘round and wait for the bank to foreclose our houses? Bank Murika don’t even want our land.”

“Greg

“That’s the damn problem!” Jones shouted back. He stood and heaved his folding chair at the podium. Jacobson ducked behind it for protection as the chair struck and fell

“Calm down, you know, scaring the children.”

“They ought’a be scared! They can’t even get a proper education in this hole. Look at Spencer over there

“Hey. HEY!... I.. I.. Look

Suddenly

“THIS IS YOUR RECKONING!” Crazy Mister Marty shouted from the back row. He rose to his feet, save for its bushy tail. “This been a long time coming. The Lizard Man prophesied it-- that your weakness and your indecision would be your undoing, visited down upon your children.”

He began patrolling the aisles

“He’s been watching you, leaving a trail of cash and rainbows. You’ll get no bailout. You brought this on yourselves. You sat by and watched your town wither and die.”

We townsfolk shifted in our chairs. 

“And YOU!” He pointed the squirrell at Jones

Jones lowered himself cautiously into the nearest chair

“The Lizard Man cometh. He’ll have this town when the last of you finally runs off

He backed up

“But run away as you may, biting off a chunk of meat and spitting it on the floor. 

“Failure is the shadow of the weak.”

And with those words

Pilgrims of fate, the sand would cover them in less than three days. They would be gone, swallowed. Their memory no more real that the roads and grass that had grew above them. They followed a trail through the stones, undisturbed by the wind for the inclines that lined it. There were no landmarks, the camp behind them was now a mirage on the phosphorescent waves. Kurt sipped from an old army canteen, periodically looking behind them and checking for tracks. Stanley held a compass, binoculars hung crudely from his neck. The inaugural explorer of Hell. 
	It wasn't long before they came to a shack in the middle of the wastes. Emptied and gutted by passing marauders, his chest rising and falling in the midday heat. He was wiping his brow and his shirt was stained with sweat.

Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been keeping me from throwing up. Am I that twisted? Something in my training must have made me able to react like this.

Cue the Blind Mistress, perhaps, that she is.

Innocence is what I see on the others. Mercy, which I find a tad unsettling. I feel an urge to yell at the screen, to alert him to what the Mistress and her Justice have been scheming for the past four tapes. I press a hand to my mouth lest I do just that.

**Marefjellet**

A courteous wind twirled around the man’s feet as he stepped out of his vehicle. A tall, but in complete disarray, a near perfect match for the thin, chaotic beard that covered most of his pale visage. A twice broken nose was his only visible feature along with his eyes, wide open with a long faded hue of green, yet observant to the point of blurred obsession.  They shot up towards the skyline. The dark, towering mountain gazed back down on him as if to mock him. It was drenched in weak, a bottle of caffeine pills and a half eaten bag of nuts. A wave of unease washed over him as he began his descent into the woods. It wasn’t so much a forest as it was a throng of tattered trunks

He hadn’t come far before he froze in his steps. There was something in the air, unlike anything he had ever felt before. It was so calming and comfortable, words that no man would use to describe this decrepit environment. He allowed it to dictate his frame of mind, and a rare rush of relief intoxicated him. The forest had already swallowed him; there was no going back now. He reached into his pockets for his caffeine pills and counted them. He wondered for a second if three pills would suffice, but a feint voice from within reassured him.

The unnamable presence surrounding him became stronger for every step. It was calming, and he marched on with a sense of curiosity only a child could match.  His newfound excitement wasn’t for long though, as he realized there was nothing here apart from the continuous ocean of trees. No animals, no exotic nature or plants, just him and the ever-present droning. He had since long lost track of time and distance, a bewildering state that drained him of both energy and trust toward his ethereal guide. His mind felt muddled, reasonable thoughts pushed away and replaced with quiet, out of nowhere he felt a burning sensation on his body, radiant glow washed away his discomforts. The murmurs in his mind morphed into malicious moans

He had reached the foot of the mountain, and a crushing loneliness brought him to his knees.
It felt as if every aspect of his life bled out of him, and he got back on his feet, smiling as he felt the hum envelop him once again. But something was amiss. Ancient instincts cried within as a surge of hostility crept up on him, the once gentle hum was now a blaring horn of unchecked hate that pierced the very essence of his being. His eyes and body failed him, and a strangely familiar pain shot through his face as he fell flat on the mountain. Pure malevolence flooded his body for what seemed like days of suffering, until a soul shattering shriek shattered every concept of existence. A lifeless husk remained, betrayed and ridiculed by the only thing he knew.

A cold breeze swept over the man’s face as he came to, seemingly unfazed by the ocean of rust on his vehicle. A sinister hum rustled in the air.

And for the plain text enthusiasts....







""Zero zero zero five four"", if there’s glass in me? My mouth is shut, already too close to the taste of the malty liquid swishing around on the mat beneath my feet, and the rising fumes of tangy sweetbreads.

Cheeking my teeth, watching as a small glimmer escapes from beneath the long grey skirt of hair surrounding Michael’s friar patch,  his nose realizing the percolation, braces, scrunching a concentrated diversion, that at once is batted away by wide and gone again lashes. Distracted from the bottles in concern, both hands on autopilot ringing through items - my customer hunches forward trying to find something to do with his hands; pockets or counter?

A peppered grey and white wiry handlebar mustache drooped over his broad jowls, yet nonetheless happy you came to see him. There is something pretty about this, in a way you’d decide not to mention.

Michael pauses in confusion a few stained once-evergreen tiles away, for some time now, lips parted in frustration. Right now you could fit a standard “two-fingers-comfortably” in there.  

You need to know Michael’s cues.

""Zero-zero-zero-five-four. That's the code for the Heineken if the barcode is damaged"" deciding it’s time to interject once again

""I know! I KNOW!"", bracing it, reading something square and green that mine can’t make out. Across from his counter was a couple, shifting their feet, exchanging furrowed glances. The same mock hesitance and furrowed look people get when they're about to field a pause in conversation. We want to convey a concerted and dutiful effort. We want to show our process and due thought made beforehand:

1) as to guise an interruption or change in subject

2) assert the end of another's thought (to steer the exchange to our present need or whim)

3) as a semi colon rather than a full stop in giving a shit.

Thats the look someone prepares before they innocently (though on a related thought of course) inquire as to what the fuck you are doing,  eases another's urgent contractions, relieving them of the need to spit up whatever decidedly irrelevant bullshit you've watched their mouth dilate in preparation for. Tactfully satisfying you with a pat on the back while impressing upon everyone the cosmic importance of our time - the concerned and Canadian way. Everyone does it, we know this because, retail. The customers often teach the salesman the importance of a good segue. Cut the shit and make the payment, one of you has to close.

Michael isn't paying attention though.

Michael was constantly on the end of this look. That diligently learned tact

“Well ahhhh

“Are you trying to find the code for that? We could grab a different case if it’s taking too long?” The feminine half of the couple is shaking her shoe at the ankle
“The Heineken is across from Spain - on the right

It made him an honest and kind man to work with though in a way. A challenge. He was impossible to contain, there are terms of engagement. You could be saved, If we like you.  It was nice to feel like you were helping out, even grudgingly so, after the days worth of fussing and empty exchanges, with customers and each other.  Insane as he was, he kind of helped my sanity.

Oh

Michael has trouble with social cues and recognizing age. The old man asked everyone who came through his line for ID. You’d see no-longer-yuppie couples with their kids present, and as a christian man, he was determined to enforce this check on anyone he served. If you refused, made a fuss, or didn't have it, he wouldn't serve you, no matter your age, he took great pleasure in fucking with them; keeping an obsessive tally of the people he'd ID on scrap receipt, if not

""WHAT ARE YOU RETARDED!? I'M FUCKING THIRTY TWO?""

""Sorry sir, you're ahhh, awfully angry.""

""Fucking-fucking retard

""OH! aahh you should ask him Mr. Peeters  ahhh nicely if you like

""Well fuck you too you FUCK!""

These exchanges would happen on the regular. This one was a few lines ago.

Soon after we’d kick out whichever impatient asshole was harassing him. This was quality entertainment, after the wear of the years, he was scattered and manic, like now.

In my cue

“Chateau Cheval - flowers and licorice on the nose - earth, sweet blackberries. You getting away this weekend?”

His mouth is a finger open, that.

Small talk about your shit life; fun. Nobody cares about your hard day - though we do as per company policy, as a gift - the gift of using your kind words for a human connection so vital. Michael got none of this, just basic pleasantries and quick change exits for him while we watch close by, doing double time on the scanner and waiting for the next bewildered shopper to pass through his line. The next act.

An old man walks up in running shoes, that he was a professor of photography, that the chemicals he used to process photos etched his hands, and numbed them. They’re two old spoons now, cupped and sun-black. He tells me he doesn’t know how much he has, so a spoon reaches in and scoops out the dimes that he watches me count. He jokes about the blonde in Australia, the one with the cheeks and the collarbones and the red dress. I ask him who he means, I say I think but I’ve never been. I say I know a really tall guy from New Zealand, filmmaking — he chuckles and leaves sideways

It's just safe practice, deadbeat, mentally ill addict) that you are you are not responsible for empathy, empathy is a responsibility. You cannot care about all these people, you have to choose what to care about. You are responsible only for that choice, and the resulting adjustment of sanity you both are provided. That at some point people stop choosing you, that at some point you won’t be the chooser.

“Have a good evening, now more composed after his transaction - glue now unstuck. He’s rocking back and forth, pausing a bit longer at his heels, white moons hidden in dark pockets.

You are not responsible for their shitty life. You are to be responsible only for your own measured obligations - those are your own interventions. Resulting fines or emotional repercussions you agree to accept.

You are not responsible for their shitty life.

“Uhh thanks Zach

He says the word today like two-day

“No problem, “We’re doing good tonight.”

Day after day, and in fact it's your job to do it with a smile. The liquor store is socially and in practice assumed a god given right if you're convincingly sober. Like milk, bread, and the time of day during business hours.

My fingers curl around the register, arching, stretching - just in time to bob back up to meet them with a new smile, two rows gapped and two-fingers-comfortably. Something rubs at me from within my front right pocket, edges sharp and moist, tangy sweetbreads. There is a smile in my blurry corner.

“Somebody shit themself in france”

“Thanks.”

The photograph next to my dresser stood out the most. I had many pictures taped to the walls in my room
The photographs had to have a special back story to win a place in my bedroom. They were collections of my best times trapped in a frozen moment stored in my camera. They deserved to be hung up so I could relive those moments with just a glance.
 Majority of them captured birthdays or holidays, of course. The pictures taken of us posed in a group, “Smile on the count of three – wait, wait, it was blurry!” are nice to keep, especially if some of those friends are gone or sick or they moved.
The pictures taken spontaneously or on accident are the best, or sitting on my camera and the flash captures a surprised face stuffed with cake. My photos are printed within the next morning on glossy rectangles and taped to the wall that same afternoon. 
An off limits section of the wall closest to my book shelf is for my modeling pictures and my hardcore professional photography only. No one needs to know that they’re taken by a little girl and that they’ve never been published. I like to think they’re taken straight from a Photoshop magazine or an America’s Next Top Model episode but in reality
I love my camera and I take it with me everywhere. I dedicate much spare time to capturing the right picture. But the photo next to my dresser stood out the most. It was so intriguing because it didn’t mean anything to me.

The sun hurts a little and I need to adjust my eyes. Eventually I see past the sun’s morning rays which layers over the wooden patio. The plastic table is cluttered with ashtrays and beer bottles. Wait. Is that my lighter?
I slide the door open. My feet tip toe across the deck glazed with morning dew. It makes my heels sticky
My lighter sits in my palm and I stare at it. I almost don’t believe it. I’ve been missing this lighter for so long. Cooper has told me countless times he hasn’t seen it

He dreamed of the dead.

This one, before the Blood Plague came. The whole House came together and fires would be lit in the hearths as cousins and uncles would tell their tales of gallantry from the previous year. They would speak of exploits at the Bridge, a narrow pass through the vast mountains separating the east and the west, or across the Skipping Stones, a series of islands that bridged the gap between the Twin Cities that looked at one another over the Sea of Stars.  

Kevan, his father’s youngest brother, called the Scourge of Tallendale. Every year he would ride down the brigands who raided along the Bridge in the name of Halloway. His coursers were the most magnificent animals in the kingdom, everyone said.

In his dreams his mother was still alive and he saw that she was tall and beautiful and kind. She laughed and everyone would laugh with her, and would come to him at the window seat where he always liked to read. She would say to the assembly, “Do you see here, this is my son.” Then she would lay her hand on his head and smile. “A beautiful boy. He reads and knows so much, more than any boy could know. Come, tell us a story my son, sing us your best tale.”

But inevitably the dream would spin out of control and she would wither and die like she had after he’d been born. Like Kevan and Jacen

He woke to the sensation of being kicked. It was not a gentle nudge but neither was it meant to injure. Paul woke slowly, jammed against something. It hurt to move and he groaned from the pain.

“So you aren’t dead after all

*A Calling of nothing*

“Can you move? Hello?” The voice was young. At first he thought that Jack had found him. He would have been undone then

“Jack?” he asked, he thought with some relief. “Eh?” the voice said again, and this time he knew it was a girl.

He blinked again and his vision began to clear. Looking up

She was his age at least, her dark eyes narrow and suspicious. A long nose swept gently upward at the tip just above a small mouth that seemed used to scowling. Freckles dotted her cheeks, some in thicker patches, some in lighter ones.

“What are you doing in a hedge?” the girl asked. He tried to shrug but the pain in his shoulder inspired only a grunt. “If it were up to me I’d say you were being stupid. Look you’ve bled all over your metal shirt and the brambles have scratched your face to ribbons.”

“Go away

“You can’t bloody well stay here. C’mon

Getting him out from under the hedge proved to be harder than he’d imagined

“Weaver’s Blood!” he cried and tried to pull away. “I’m not some lummox ox boy you can handle like… like…” He reached for a word

&gt;Hey all. For a long while I have wanted to have a Ventrilo or similar server to
allow writers from all over the world to chat
bouncing ideas around and offering advice to each other and a great place to
make friends and talk to those you meet on Reddit and other places
help keep some people motivated to continue writing

“You’ll want to speak to Lord Mossfield himself if he’s here. Do not treat with anyone lower than your station

Even in the cool wind the lord was sweating and smelled of the bogs. Jack coughed and Paul nearly gagged. He kept his composure as best he could and advanced Rock up to meet him. Jack and Loukas came as well.

“Well, he snapped thick fingers and a retainer placed a frog leg in his hand. The lord slobbered the snack down quickly and went on, Paul too taken aback to interject. “So it seems I was right, the old raven sends a boy to treat with us! A weakly son from an enfeebled Lord.”

“That’s Sir Paulin to you

“As you say, wanting his sword. “This man is Lord Halloway’s own son, Heir to Hallow Hill.” Loukas’s voice was strong and even, commanding the fat lord to listen.

“I act in his name and goodwill

Mossfield roared in laughter, boy, fine. But I’ll have you know I would sooner treat with a dog than your lot, your sick father or not.”

“We came in good faith

Mossfield took another frog leg from his retainer and chewed it

It wasn’t until he sucked the marrow from the bones that he answered Paul. “These folk here,” Mossfield said, tossing away the last of the leg bones and wiping the back of his hand along his lips. “They don’t even know who your father is. They haven’t paid noble tithe to him in so long they forgot how it’s done. So I made them mine and if your father wants’em back he can come get them himself, by the old custom, with sword and blood. But it’s been years, why trouble himself now?”

*Father wanted it done, yet… “These lands are by rights the property of Lord Halloway. Regardless of what you say, they should not pay tithe to you.”

Lord Mossfield giggled

The crowd quickly parted to reveal the largest man Paul had ever seen. He was easily seven feet tall and unlike Lord Mossfield

original three were sitting. They were all drinking water in silence. The
bartender brought her a water too. No words exchanged.


It's called anime. I hate it. There are boy heroes and women exploding at the

creepy shut-ins. I guess I love it then too. Why else would I watch over eight

heat of firm breasts mounted on a suspiciously young woman. The thin

Ransom: A Bo Spade Story

Friday
6:45 PM

His phone rattled against his car keys and Swiss army knife in the right front pocket of his jeans. Bo ignored it as he listened as Ezra told a story to the blonde across the bar about him and Bo from years ago when, or the trip had never developed beyond the drunken idea phase years ago. He took another sip from his glass as he reassured himself that these were the sorts of stories that Ezra loved to invent to impress the younger, dumber generation of blondes that always seemed to find themselves seated within ear shot of the two of them.

O’Bannon’s looked how it looked every Friday at about this time. As many of the few patrons who enjoyed their after work cocktails at this early hour were a bit older than Bo and Ezra, a local band and its few lone groupies would set the stage in the main room. Bo and Ezra, however, preferred the third and smallest room that they were already in. “The Library,” as it was affectionately referred, was a smaller room that connected to both the back and main rooms. Bo preferred it because of its large, comfortable booths, and beautiful mahogany bar. Ezra preferred its strategically located bathrooms that forced every woman in the place to pass by at least once during the evening.

The phone buzzed in his pocket again. This time, but immediately realized that the department never bothered him on Friday nights. Friday nights were the one night a week that he had demanded to not be disturbed. Fridays were reserved for him and Ezra to do what they did best. 

Finally

“Dad

“Robert. It’s your father.” Robert. The name sounded so foreign to Bo. His father was the only person who insisted on referring to him by his given name. Still

 “It’s about Christina

 “What’s wrong with her? Is she upset?”

“No. No. Well

“Taken? The hospital again?”

“No! She has been taken. She is being fucking held hostage. Or for ransom. Or something. I don’t know what the hell is going on. Malcolm just called and that’s all he said before he hung up.”

Bo felt his heart attempting to escape the strict confines of his strong chest. His sister? Taken? How much scotch had he had? Or perhaps his father was the one drunk this time. What was he rambling on about? He was used to getting these sorts of phone calls from Christina, had often called him frantically for one reason or the other. Ever since Bo was old enough to speak he had a special bond with his sister. Whenever she was upset, all she needed was his ear to help calm her down. He had forgotten that his father was still on the line.

“Bo?! Hello?! Are you there?! Get your ass over here!”

“Are you sure you understood right

“Either Malcolm has given me another reason to hate him

Ezra glanced at him and saw the color drain from his face. He immediately knew that something was wrong. He and Bo had only gotten to O’Bannon’s an hour ago

“Bo?! What is it

Bo found it more and more difficult for his feet to find the floor. The voice of his friend may as well have been coming from across the street

Bo glanced around the bar. Everyone’s eyes were locked onto his, desperately trying to get his attention.

“Ezra

Ezra didn’t ask a single question. The two had been friends since high school and since then over a decade had passed. The two trusted each other’s judgment completely. Anytime the other had ever needed anything, and they never took it for granted. Without a moment’s hesitation, Ezra slapped Bo across the face. The warm sensation across his left cheek immediately cleared his head. His sister was in trouble. He had to go. Ezra was yelling at him.

“Get the hell out of here!”

Without a word, she had found outlets for it.  Bo ripped the door open and piled in. He yanked his keys out his pocket and jammed them into the ignition. The Camaro roared to life as he dropped the clutch and slammed his foot onto the accelerator. The smell of rubber filled the air as the tires begrudgingly tried to find traction on the slick asphalt of the parking lot. Finally, the tires caught and all that was left behind was the scent of burned rubber and gasoline.

Immediately, John began to retort with a long parade of reasons why he simply didn’t want to listen to country music...but he managed to seize himself before he let any words leave his mouth. He knew this job was important; that’s what Emily told him, and that’s all he needed.

“I’m sorry Ms. Flausterson, not filled with chocolates being put in my mouth. Stop doing what you’re not doing and help me out!”, demanded Megan.

John Sterbob sighed heavily, “You are not responsible for this job honey.” He attempted to reflect on what she meant by that. Did she mean that his presence in this “Meagan’s” life was not a result of his actions? Was she trying to say that whether he performed to Meagan’s expectations or not wasn’t important? Perhaps she was implying that Meagan’s current life situation wasn’t his responsibility. More questions…every day, more and more questions. 

It had been a while since John took a moment to look at the room he worked with Meagan in. For a nice building, her wheelchair, a picture of Meagan and an unknown man, and of course, Meagan herself. John never really felt like he was supposed to be in this room every day, helping this woman he couldn’t remember meeting with her daily activities. It all seemed very foreign to him…the only place he felt like he belonged to was his house he had with Emily. There were too many times in the past week when John would find himself being in Meagan’s office and feeling like he was invisible, only allowed to exist when Meagan told him to. At their house though? He was the center of all the attention…and yet, demanding his attention…with dread

“John, and do you see me capable of typing it myself? No. Get your ass over to the computer and type what I say!” The defeated shell dragged himself to the computer, sat down, and began typing Meagan’s words. As demeaning as this part of the job was, John found that it was a good way to make time pass, and it helped him focus on something other than the massive amount of questions that were always prancing around inside his mind. Before he knew it, the report was done, he knew it would only be a matter of hours before he was there again the next day.

A Mild Case of Anarchy

Silence. Nothing but silence. It’s an eerie feeling, the only thing making noise was the crackling of my burning cigarette while taking a drag and the rusty seat shifting beneath me. I wonder if they know, that I still deliberately disobey them. What was once a rush of excitement became a habit. Waiting until one in the morning, walking slowly down the creaky hardwood hallway to check if my mother was still asleep, and then galloping back to the garage to begin my small deed of anarchy, was now normal. 

The cherry of the Marlboro 100 was running low and I began to feel the heat transfer from the tip of the cigarette to the filter and burn my lips. The smoke was close to my face and began to flow into my eyes, so I dip the butt into the ashtray, making sure that any of bright red of the cherry was smothered so as not to show its ugly face in the pitch black. Checking that everything was the way it was when I got there, I climbed the small brick steps, closed the door and ran back to my room to write this note. By now the nicotine is completely out of my bloodstream and a sense of normalcy has returned to my mood. The pepsi I grabbed on the way back has a certain spice to it from the ashy taste leftover in my mouth. 

I don’t try to disappoint my family, my lack of cash, and the lingering smell it left in my bathroom. So I picked up smoking, my parents are both fucking chimneys compared to my once daily cigarette, so it’s not hard to start. If you go through a pack a day you don’t really notice one smoke fewer. The smell has clouded their senses for so many years they can’t smell the smoke in my hair or taste the tobacco when they kiss me goodnight. Every time they would catch me breaking a rule it would always follow the same pattern. My mom would try to comfort me and figure out what it was that drove me to this decision, I would bust out some half ass excuse that my dad would see right through it and start screaming at me, waking up my sister because it always happened late at night, and just accepted it like I did.

Truth is I have no clue why I do what I do. Of course I feel these depressing moods and anxiety, like a cocktail of natural and artificial buzzes that help me sleep at night.      

I do hope that I someday I won’t be dependent on these things to keep me going. Zoloft only takes you so far and cigarettes seem to last shorter and shorter the more you smoke. My peers seem to get along just fine without them, parental affairs, money trouble, death, the usual grievances. Knowing about all these make me feel both lucky that I don’t have to deal with the misfortunes that befall most youths, and guilty that I feel so shitty for seemingly trivial matters. So I guess I’m at no position to judge why they get drunk, dance and lose their phones in the crowd of grinding hormones.
The years of high school will run out eventually

So as I lay back and finish up my existential crisis for the evening, I live day to day at the whims of a smothered Marlboro cherry in a pitch black garage.

*Lest we forget

Gales of laughter and cheer erupted by the roadside as the boy with his thick, all right. It had been the third time he had missed the ball that day. His mates were furious; he had bought them down with his incompetence, yet he didn't so much as admitted that he lacked the skill.

Far across on the other side of the road stood a little boy, and shorts garnished with mud stains that covered him just above his knees. Asphalt kissed his bare feet with heat of scorching sun. He was growing out of his clothes, and needed a pair of shoes.

The light signalled red, almost dropping his bundle of ballpoint-pens. The window rolled down and with it came the yelling of the driver--he chose to ignore him and strode towards the other side. He was good at ignoring. It’s something a boy like Ahmad had to have to filter out the world around him. Obscenities were nothing but hackneyed to him. On reaching the other side, he caught his breath. Beads of sweat dangled from his chin as he gasped for air. He had to shout at the top of his lungs now--he hadn't sold  a single pen this afternoon.

Blue, he shouted; his voice porpoising. Most chose to ignore him; some slowed down to see what was at sell and moved on, disinterested. He was dizzy, the heat had been overwhelming, yet he could not stop now. His mother lay sick in bed, his infant sister too weak to even cry out. He sat down on a block of concert staring wide around him. In that time, he saw a mother struggling to keep hold of her daughter. Her fingers curled around a cone lade with vanilla flavoured ice-cream; drops of melted cream raced down the curves of her fat fingers,” her mother snapped back at her. Whatever it took to get out of boy’s piercing glare.

He wanted to go home. Curl up beside her mother,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_1fd5ee

I suppose I should have seen it coming. It’s quite clear in retrospect,” they would say. “She`s weird.” “She has green feet and eats the neighbour’s pets.” But the heart sees what it wants to see, and I put my doubts about Lily to one side and soon fell for her.

Looking back, but all I can be sure of is that I was instantly drawn to her.

Our first encounter was in the second week of the new semester, hanging above as I walked across the campus to my computer science class distracted by the fact that I was late again. I was busy imagining the heart crushing awkwardness of walking into a packed lecture theater late, of trying to open the door ever so gently so as to sneak in unnoticed, and of the neglected hinge inevitably letting out a tremendous sound which would echo around the hall, seemingly amplified by the slowness of my pushing. I was picturing the look of piercing resentment in the eyes of my peers that said “we all made it here on time, so why couldn’t you?”, and the kind look of sadness in the wrinkles of the professor’s face that merely revealed what little hope he had for me this year. I was so busy picturing all this

“Dammit

“Ha!” A female laugh came from behind me. “Yeah, wiping her hair from her face to reveal her smile. She had a slight overbite, but it was framed by lips so full and soft I was sure I recognised them from a gum commercial. She offered me her hand to help me up and I could see her face clearly.

I must have been staring then because she asked if I was okay, I was okay, more than okay, that I was in fact knocked out by her beauty, but this wasn’t a movie and such lines don’t sound as smooth in real life. I needed an answer, a witty yet breezy line to keep the conversation flowing with this girl whose life I had just stumbled into.

“bjrrrrrr” was what I went with.
“I’m sorry?”
“bjrrrrrrr!” I clarified. Maybe I was concussed
“Fuck, idiot,” I swore I heard her say to herself. She replaced her smile with a grimace as the air felt light and my head became heavy. I must have fallen and passed out at this point because when I woke up the sun illuminated the sky and the leaves felt crisp beneath me, rustling as I steadied myself.

Long story short, the invisible bacteria that coats their bodies causes almost instant death in 90% of cases. Her body has gradually acclimated to Earth now so it doesn’t happen anymore. At that time though, she passed it off as just a concussion. So actually I was extremely fortunate to survive, she literally nearly killed my the first time we met. But like I said, we laugh about it now.


The first time that I thought something was really up was when Lily tried to eat my neighbor's 2 year old daughter. Wait, that doesn’t clear things up at all does it? Allow me to explain.

What happened was, day and night. The neighbor often went out on errands for hours at a time leaving the child to annoy the whole apartment block. So this particular night I was getting especially tetchy about the kid ruining the romantic mood that I’d hoped to create. I had strategically placed candles around my room, put on some jazz radio station that I’d never listened to before. I had really gone all out, you see. We tried to ignore it, drinking more and more red wine. There was a few minutes of blissful silence, but the sound soon started again louder than before.

“Oh. My. God
“Leave it to me, we have a trick for dealing with this.”

She let herself out, even throwing in a few animalistic growls too. At this point I realised I was quite drunk. I also noticed that Lily still hadn’t come back yet so I went next door to find her, wondering if she’d gotten lost. I approached the door and a slither of light was leaking out, projecting a triangle into the hallway.

“Lily?” I carefully opened the door. She was kneeling on the floor bending over the child, I thought and the child wasn’t screaming anymore. She carried on softly kissing the childs face, and the kiss became a lick. That’s...not normal, I thought but the child had calmed down so I guessed it was okay. She continued doing this and I realised that I must have been drunker than I thought because my eyes seemed to start playing tricks on me and I could have swore I saw Lily’s jaw detach, and her mouth start to envelop the child’s head.

“Lily!” She turned around fully
“Everything okay? I was just putting him to sleep.” She touched my arm again. “Let’s get back to your place.”
“What...” I looked over the the sleeping child and motioned at it with my arm. “The hell was that?”
“Shh, I dont’ know what you think you saw, but let’s go back and relax.”

I gave my own head a shake and conceded that I was a little drunk and soon we were back in my apartment and asleep next to each other on my couch. 

She recently explained to me that actually on her planet


The time when I really knew that Lily was an alien was also the day that I realised I loved her. It was about 6 months since we met, but the truth is that I mostly just liked the way she looked in the mornings before she put her makeup on, before she brushed her hair. I liked this secret version of her that only I got to see.

We decided to skip class that morning. Professor Stein’s class on numerical analysis had comprehensively lost out to Lily’s suggestion of driving out into the fields and having a picnic by the creek just out of town. On the highway north the numbers of other vehicles gradually diminished and after a few minutes our’s the only car on the road.

I guess my driving must’ve gone into autopilot when it happened. I never was the most attentive driver, but I guess I leaned forward to get a better view of the sky to check the weather. I must’ve been thinking about whether the rain would ruin our picnic plans, so my eyes followed the clouds instead of the road and although I can’t remember the crash itself, I’ll never forget what Lily did next.

My body was lying next to the upturned car. I could see the blood seeping through my shirt, I guess I’ll never know. I remember Lily kneeling beside me and wiping her hair from her face again, her overbite now framed by lips pursed in concentration as she moved her hands up and down my chest creating a strange heat that made my lungs gasp and my chest constrict. Her hands were glowing, sparkling, and she pressed harder onto my body and I heard a sound like TV static, which was coming from Lily, not the still steaming floor of the car. I felt myself now dragged back into my body and with a draw of blood filled air my eyes met Lily’s again.

“I love you
“I guess
“It’ll be alright
“I won’t tell anyone.”

Jennifer Forever:

You never forget your first port. The pain that shoots through your head. The almost blinding light that flashes from behind your eyes. The way the sky seems to open up into a whirlpool of clouds, before closing with a clap of dull thunder. The way the blood drips from your nose. The way the world never quite seems the same afterwards. Yeah, you never forget your first port.

Here is the story of mine.



May 10th 2014.

“Did you see this?” Jennifer asked

“What is it?” I squinted to see the screen.

“Here, its view counter showing zero.

“What am I supposed to be looking at?” My eyes still squinting

“Just watch it

The video opens with a kid running, his sneakers becoming muddied, occasionally remembering to point the camera upwards towards a collection of thin trees he was moving towards. I can hear a male and a female voice off camera.

“Some kids screwing around in a field

“Just keep watching” She tapped my arm

The kids make it to the trees. The kid holding the camera pans around a bit to take in his friends, maybe 17, 18, and a blue eyed blonde girl the same age. It seems like it was getting dark wherever this was, but there is a blue glow coming from a clearing just past the trees, lighting the surroundings.

“The hell is that?” My eyes widened.

“Keep. Watching.” Jennifer tapped my arm

There kids are saying something in voices that sound animated

“You know

“I think it is. The cows and sheep aren't there

A light shoots up from the trees. A bang like the sound of trees falling. The camera drops to the ground, her face bloodied and her blue eyes wide and vacant as she admires the lens for a moment. The wind blows blonde hair across her face.

“Im sorry” the woman says. Dropping the camera to the ground

“Who posted this? Some kind of student horror movie or something? Viral marketing for an insurance company or some crap like that? Fuck it, the content you are looking for has been deleted.""

“What happened here?” I asked, as to the woman who eyes I had just met. I leaned back in my chair. I realised my mouth was wide open as I thought about what we'd just watched. I leaned forward again, refreshing the page. The same message appeared. ""sorry, the content you are looking for has been deleted.""

“Im sorry”. These words


“Say, who was already grabbing her coat from her chair.



It was a short drive. Without checking the car navigation, nothing relevant. ""Blue light minnesota forest May”. Same results. I sighed and I looked over to Jennifer and watched her eyes narrowed in focus on the night road searching for possible obstructions. I thought about how the nights in Minnesota always seemed somehow darker than any other place in America, yet how the moonlight seemed so much brighter. I watched her hands gripped on the steering wheel tightly. I saw the cassette tape I had given her, my scrawled in crayon on it, still laying on her dashboard, sliding with the camber of the country roads. Jennifers beat up car instinctively came to a jerky stop just by a large wooden house. Its exterior was a now a faded grey color, neglected paint chipping away.

“Its been a while since I came here” she ran her fingers through her hair.

“You ever still think about that asshole?” I asked.

“Who?”

“Noah.”

“Who?”

I got out of the car. Jennifer followed. As we moved around the outside of the empty house

“He and his family moved away so quickly, now almost running as we headed towards the trees. “Pretty cold of him to just leave without mentioning anything to you. His family too.”

“Look


As we got closer, where Noahs animals used to graze. Something was illuminating the inside of the woods. At first it seemed like just the moonlights reflection, or just the torch of a dog walker. Our feet trampling through the long grass, stumbling as we went, it became clearly a shade of blue, rising in an uncanny sphere from the trees now directly in front of us. The tall trees, silhouetted against the growing, making us instinctively turn around, as we fell in each others arms

Tear it apart


----------------


Gussie was a poor girl. She had rough hands, no one gave her any thought. Morning and evening was spent working side by side with her brothers and sisters on the pitiful patch of dirt her father called a farm. Her mother had been mute and dumb since her illness ten years back, and her frequently inebriated father had no time for “malarkey” from any of his children. Gussie had no one then.

Gussie had gone to school once.  She thought the one room school house was beautiful compared to the pathetic shack at home. Where Gussie lived, she smiled broadly as each clean, freshly scrubbed face stared back at her with a mixture of contempt and interest.  Gussie wanted a friend. 

The teacher was kind enough to Gussie. She handed her a slate and took her name down in the book. Gussie had never seen anyone write anything before. She watched as teacher dipped the sleek black pen into the ink

At recess

“I’m Martha

“You stand there. Hold his hand

 “Just hold on! It’ll be fun!” Gussie stood still and held the boy’s hand. Suddenly Gussie was whipped across the lawn

 “Stupid

All the children laughed at pitiful Gussie. The tears in her clothes were now even worse than when she had arrived

Gussie slinked silently away and hid in the root cellar until her brothers and sisters returned from the field.

 “We told you not to go, anyway? We’ll not use it.” Gussie hung her head in shame. She wanted too many things.
Gussie spent the following months working in the fields with her brothers and sisters. Things were empty then. Nothing ever changed. Father stayed drunk and only communicated with his children in moans and grunts. Mother stared out the window all day

In the afternoon when it was too hot to work, or take the path towards the big Decatur road to watch people coming from town.  

One hot Thursday afternoon when everyone had drank their fill from the stream and fallen asleep under a shade tree

Vultures circled to the east over some recently departed animal. Gussie watched them circle with and thought of the school children.  She wanted to kill those birds. She wanted to rip them out of the sky with her hands and bang their heads together until she saw blood. 

Suddenly a man appeared on a horse in the distance. As he approached

“How do you do?” the man said

Gussie froze. She had never talked to a grown man other than her father. She bowed her head and stared silently at her feet. 

“Come now

 “That’s ok. I’m looking for the Tidwell place. You know of it?” Gussie started and looked at the man. That was her house. She had never seen this man before. He looked nothing like her father. Father had a brother

“I’m no kin

Gussie shook her head and pointed in the direction of her house

“Good afternoon

Gussie stood looking at her feet for several minutes, stopping every few feet in hesitation, staring all the time at the blue hatband. She started to follow more quickly as the horse began to trot. When the horse got too far away for her to see the blue hat band, she began to run. 

By the time she got to the house

“You can’t take them because you lied. She wasn’t right! She’s never been right. You made a promise that you couldn’t keep. You didn’t keep it!” 

“You made a deal with me, no matter what,’ I think were your words, if you need reminding. You made a deal. Your wife for your children when the time came.  The time has come for me to collect.”

The man took his hat off and looked at Gussie. He slowly pulled the blue felt off and stretched his hand out towards Gussie. “Come

Gussie slowly inched forward

“Come,” the man said. 

Gussie grabbed the blue ribbon

“And she will be my favorite

She woke in pain.
 
Her lungs burned
 
I’m alive
 
Opening her eyes was difficult. They were crusted over with a film that refused to crack
 
“You’re awake
 
Aderyn was left alone in her darkness and quiet for a time until a warm, a boy was standing over her. She couldn’t make out his face, her vision was still too blurry, but already she knew that he was a stranger to her. No one she knew spoke with that accent.
 
A Groundling
 
“Don’t try and move, a reaction to the air.”
 
“Yes, demanding to be satiated. He pulled the bottle from her after a moment and she growled.
 
“Not so much
 
“Wh-where?” she managed to say
 
“You’re safe now
 
“Can’t… can’t hurt me, the memories of what she’d done came flooding back like an angry river. The slap. Running out of the Viewing Platform. Her mother’s terrible visage. The Queen!
 
She panicked and began to fight her bonds. I have to get out of here, the tighter the bonds seemed to get. Then she felt something cold press against her arm and just as her vision began to clear, it faded to black again.
 
When next she woke, and her hands came easily to her face. With a groan, Aderyn sat up and wiped her eyes until they focused and she could take in her surroundings.
 
And froze.
 
This was no Lord’s keep. No minor lord slept in prefab rooms, mechanical doors. The only light in the room came from a flickering lantern by the only door. It was lit by flame and not ether. She was in a Groundling habitat, a slave’s quarters perhaps.
 
What happened? She thought about it as she slipped her legs from the thin sheets that covered her and put her feet on the floor. She was no longer wearing her dress
 
For a time, exhausted, she sat back on the bed. It was a simple thing, just a foam mattress on a metal box frame. She’d seen a Groundling habitat only once, when Ian had taken her into his family’s farms. Those habitats were warmer than this, with ether lighting and glow panels on the walls. If he was in one now, their Lord did not care for them as Ian’s family did.
 
A bottle was left on the floor next to her bed. She picked it up
 
She had to get out of here. If she was in Revnari’s habitats then it wouldn’t be long before she was discovered and returned to her mother. She set the bottle down
 
This time her legs held enough that she made it halfway to the door. There she stopped and sank to her knees
 
It had no release, but found the door did not move. Frustrated she pushed harder and harder until she slipped to the ground again, exhausted.
 
Tears formed in her eyes. Useless, easier for her and easier for her mother. 

She probably thinks I’m dead anyway.

For a long moment, her mother sighed. “Very well Sir Loran, best bring us in.”

Aderyn found Zennir beautiful. Small seas brushed up against high-rising mountains. Those mountains swept down into lush

The battlefield was a valley nestled between two of the small mountain peaks. For miles only cultivated farmland was to be seen. Churned soil replaced green grass and her mother wrinkled her nose at the sight. “Not very pretty

The yacht settled a few hundred yards from the battlefield and nestled itself between two large hills. The viewing stand was already filling up with ladies in their finery. A few lords who were too old, but the distance made it hard. 

Her mother rose and she followed her to the airlock, but it would never do. Groundling air was full of toxins and no noble lady would dare breath it in. The last time Aderyn had let herself, she'd been sick for a month.

As they walked across the short expanse of grass, she had been in love with the planet and with the young boy who had shown it to her.

But Ian has no use for a Null. The thought made her mood sour as they approached the viewing stand's ramp. She followed her mother up and into the airlock

Nearly a hundred noblemen and ladies gathered within. Serving bots hovered about

The viewing stand was simple as such things went. Vaguely rectangular it had a large amphitheater where the nobles would sit and watch the war. Behind that were tables and chairs and viewscreens where they could sit with one another and talk,” her brother Redrick had told her often enough. 

They went first to the tables but did not sit. Her mother glared at her when she took a bite-sized sandwich and a glass of wine. Aderyn merely shrugged. If she was going to sit through this
	
“Must you eat so much?” her mother hissed, if you get sick? I'll see you switched myself.”
	
And then a tall, her eyes unable to take themselves off the blue-white circlet of ether that encircled her head. She’d seen a likeness of her only once, an ether-image her father brought home once from Court.
	
“My Queen
	
“Oh Lyana, her voice sounding like it was on the edge of delightful laughter. Aderyn both loved and coveted it at once. It made her feel at ease, calm, despite her panic. Still, she kept her eyes on the floor.
	
“Your Majesty
	
“Please
	
“Of course, yes. Your Majesty, this is Aderyn. Do stand up child.”
	
Aderyn stood on shaking knees

Their eyes met.

Green, beyond the kind smile on her pale pink lips. It was sadness.

“I’m sorry

Her mother did not reply and the Queen released Aderyn’s chin. She stood

They left the Starkeep aboard their family’s star yacht, most of them of lower nobility. There were no Groundlings serving House Medani, a sign of their power. As Aderyn stared into the red liquid of her drink, she thought they could do with some Groundling help.

Their House was small and too many of her cousins were being pushed into duties that were beneath them. She had been served the wine by Jevrey Cannith

She set it down and looked out the viewport, knights flying as escort. The small, triangular craft were so fast and maneuverable that Aderyn imagined they were a thrill to fly.

Not that I could fly one without a Spark. The thought soured her mood even more and she turned back to look at her mother. Lyana Medani sat rigid and placid. She spoke to her cousin too quietly for her to hear. Then Jevrey left in quite the hurry. She’s sent him to get her a cushion no doubt. A Medani must be comfortable

“Stop slouching

Aderyn sat and hoped she could avoid any more discussion until they were through the Jump Gate. It loomed in the distance, Ether swirling and roiling as the portal to subspace opened. Even as she watched, it began.

Aderyn had only been planet side once during a lightning storm, but Aderyn always imagined that the Gate roared.

Subspace, would I Spark? With a jolt, the yacht touched the edge of the Gate portal and for the blink of an eye, time stood still. Her heart skipped a beat. She forgot to breath. Memories shifted and what was the past became the present and future.

Her father lifted her high and she squealed, they would get married.

A snap and her mind reverted to real time and she held a hand to her forehead. I hate that. She would not cry

“You best not be sick during the war

The trip from Meda to Hyperion took just over an hour and then it was just a single, her family’s liegelord. He would be aboard a destroyer or perhaps he was a knight and flew one of the small Chariots. It had been over a year since she spoke to him.

“Come, mother?” she asked, trying to sound eager.

“Zennir, enlarged. “A pleasant moon, for atmosphere.”

“A good place for a war

Her mother eyed her and then smirked. “Good as any

“I rather liked the wind when we went to Persephone.”

Her mother speared her with an iron gray gaze. “None of that kind of talk with the Nevans.” Her mother turned away

A young man in House uniform came to stand before them. On his left breast was the sigil of the house, his power within the House was low but hers was even lower.

“Ma’am?” the knight said

“Has the Nevan Host arrived?”

“They have

Did anyone tell him her daughter is a Null? Aderyn felt her cheeks burn again

“His son? Will Lord Rhyen not be joining us?”

“He will not it seems. Detained on House business he said

Aderyn felt her heart twist in fear. Having to impress her mother on any normal day would be hard but now she was feeling slighted. She had no hope in that regard. Not now.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/19djm8/the_blood_part_3_a_serialized_scifi_novella/

_______

The morning air was cool and fresh in Elderwood, trying to look loose and relaxed. Hopefully they would do the same, it wouldn’t do good for them to be uptight and distracted around me.

I was staring at the statue in the courtyard when Akre pulled around in a cloth topped wagon. I eyed him questioningly as the guardsmen hurried into the back of the vehicle.
“So we don’t attract attention
I snorted indifferently and hoisted myself into the front seat beside him. With a crack of a whip we were off
“She lives on the eastern side, so she has money. Her estate isn’t large, but it is guarded. So we can expect a bit of a fight.” The wagon bounced roughly on the cobblestone road. Akre slowed the horse’s pace a bit just as another bump assaulted the cart’s wheels.
“Of course
The cool air assaulted my face

We all jumped off as soon as the wagon pulled up to Estate Mysse. Akre was right, eyeing the building with suspicion.
“We’ll have to go in through the front. There’s no back door
I nodded and followed his lead up to the large oak door. Akre nodded at one of the guardsmen

Shouts echoed and steel clanged as the home’s own guards faced off with the city guards. One of the rookies were immediately cut down, raising the head of the arrow to be level with the nearest guard’s back. One of the rookies had locked swords with him, and they stared each other down across their weapons. I pulled back on the string, tensing my back muscles, and a single breath later the arrow was loosed, flying across the room and burying itself in the man’s spine. He screamed loudly, dropping his guard, and I offered a nod in return. Akre pulled away as the man he had been fighting alongside the other rookie fell down
“Were they expecting us?” I said.
“Seems so
He cursed
“We better keep moving. We still have a mage to catch.”
He motioned for one of the rookies to pull the dead guardsman outside to the wagon

On our way up, the halls were lit by ornate lanterns. It was all so very normal and stereotypical of a noblewoman’s house. I pondered on this idly before a loud noise brought me back to the present. Two more guards had barged out from a door down the hallway from us. Immediately Akre and the rookie charged and engaged them. I notched another arrow in my bow and pulled back, taking aim at the farthest guard’s head. I waited a few breaths as he and the rookie circled and fought, then released as soon as I had a clear shot. The men fell back with a grunt, and a moment later Akre had the other incapacitated. We hurried forward, but I paused to step over them. I glanced at the bodies as I moved forward, and it was then when I realized something.

“Akre
The captain turned around and glanced at me
“What do you mean
I shook my head
“They aren’t wearing noble colors. Or a uniform of any kind
The captain cursed
“What do you make of it then?” He asked. His tone was strange
I merely shrugged my shoulders.
“Idk. That she couldn’t afford to keep full time guards? I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.”
Akre seemed satisfied at that and moved onward
“A servant’s stairwell? In an estate this size?”
Akre snorted
“A servant’s staircase?” I said quietly. “Where are the servants then?”
Akre shot me a look that told me to keep quiet

In the small room before up stood six mercenaries
“A’right now
Akre lowered his sword
“What business have you here
“What say you, you the one with no business here.”
I took stock of the men as I replied
“I have plenty business here
Of the six men
“I must ask that you step aside. By standing in our way you are obstructing law and justice
The two archers relaxed a little
“Well, holding a mocking grin on his face. “There ain’t no man gunna-”
It all happened in the span of a breath. I quickly charged the archers, turning the arrow around in my left hand. Akre had jumped him and locked swords with the man, allowing my arrow to find its way between the man’s shoulder blades. I didn’t wait to make sure he was dead, instead I turned back to the two archers. I drew another arrow from my quiver, and before the men could stand back up I had notched another, taken aim, and delivered it to one of the men’s chest. The other one promptly dropped his weapon and kneeled down, but remained locked in combat with the last. One more arrow made short work of the man

“Glad we have an archer with us on this mission
“Don’t speak so soon. Archers are rarely good in these close-quarters situations.”
I motioned for the rookie to tie up the last guy and take him back to the wagon. Akre moved on ahead to scout up the hallway while I helped the young man. The mercenary glared at me as I tied his cuffs

Akre made a small sound, he quietly opened the door a bit more so that I could see into the room.

Mages aren’t known for being normal. Most of them live in quiet reclusion, learning the language of the universe. A few of them sometimes make an impact on the public consciousness, becoming great heroes or terrible villains. Some of them have helped the kingdom, vanquishing armies or staying plagues and destruction from the kingdom. Small numbers of them made themselves known by being aggressors and anarchists, from murdering rich and powerful nobles to spoiling the village stew.

The room I saw before me was, with silken drapes circling the top of the frame. A very ornate wardrobe sat to the right of it, with a large glass window between them. On the other side of the room sat a heavy wooden desk, with two stacks of books and a pile of papers in the middle. And on that pile rested the head of a noblewoman, cradled in her arms asleep.

Within seconds, readying myself for the confrontation, but Akre, normally bold and fierce, just stood behind me, as if unsure what to do. I sighed, and circled around to the side of the woman. It seemed she had fallen asleep working on something. Her dark hair hung freely around her face, I wouldn’t have recognized her as a mage at all.

I nudged the woman’s shoulder with my bow, despite her appearance, and probably very dangerous. She stirred slowly, blinking her dark eyes.
“Ma’am?” I said
“You’re under arrest

I would greatly appreciate some critique &amp; feedback on the fan fiction I am writing. ,KiiLLBOT,9,3,5,"The fan fiction is based on the series Clannad. Clannad is an anime based on a visual novel. Usually in visual novels

Having saw Clannad is helpful but all you need to know about Kotomi is that she is a very smart girl who is also very socially inept (spends most of her time in the library). 

------------------------------ This is a small part --------------------------

“Kotomi!” “Hey, How are you this morning?” 

""I am good thanks. Thought I might come into school on time for a change.” says Tomoya whilst rubbing his eyes.

“That is great. Once you get used to it

“So

“Say

“I would love to Tomoya!” exclaimed Kotomi with a huge smile on her face.

“Great

""Me neither...""

Tomoya slowly strolls through the classroom and collapses into his seat. “Oh hi Tomoya. I didn’t expect to see you this early.” says Ryou from across the room. 

“Well uh. I thought it would be nice to be on at least some peoples good side for a change.” “Well I think it’ great Tomoya” replies Ryou as she now stand in front of Tomoya’s desk.

“So how are you Tomoya?” “Tired

Tomoya grows more bored of his lessons by the second. Looks over to Youhei’s desk to find him sleeping on his desk. Tomoya kicks the back of his chair and with that Youhei jumps out and screams.

“AHHHHHH!” “SUNOHARA! SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP” Screamed the teacher. “Oh

“What’s was that for man?” Asks Youhei. “What? I didn’t do anything I swear.” Lies Tomoya. Youhei slams his head back on the desk &amp; goes back to sleep.

Dinner rolls around. Tomoya heads to the cafeteria to grab some sandwiches. Once the sandwiches have been acquired

“Oh shut it you. Say

“Oh. Well then I’ll let you get along to your little date. Bye!” “It’s not a da-” Kyou has already ran off before he can finish his sentence. 

Tomoya slides open the door to the library and walks in. 

“Kotomi? You in here?” As Tomoya continues to walk into the Library

Looking at the way the light from the window hits Kotomi’s face. “Hi Tomoya!” “Tomoya?” Kotomi gets no reply. 

She stands up and walks towards him. Tomoya’s eyes follow her face. Still stuck for words, What? I’m sorry. I was a little dizzy.” responds Tomoya. 

“Hey

They both sit &amp; begin eating. “So how was your classes Tomoya?” asks Kotomi. “Ah

“Ah

They both reached for the remaining packaging leftover from the sandwiches. Their hands connect. One on top of another. It feels as if time has completely stopped. 

Tomoya pulls his hand back &amp; blushes. “What’s wrong Tomoya?” asked Kotomi with a slightly concerned look on her face. “Oh nothing

 There is not a single patch of grass
A light mist hangs over the trees with a gentle grasp, a new flower that gleams.

It seems quiet, has now been swallowed whole by the past. No matter where a weary hunter, traveler, or gatherer ventured, all that could be seen was the vegetation.
Except in the middle of the forest. But noone ever went there

Seemingly human, they will grow, vines creeping along the ground until they form a body of human shape, a child seemingly average. However, nothing can hide their inner nature, the sunlight being moved through their veins and the most amazing eyes, the purest green like that of emeralds.

They are not cared for by their own parents, and all events surrounding them. The tiny forest clearing is riddled with huts, the children running about as if they've been raised by their own parents.

There isn't just one of these little settlings, though few and far in between, may be found.. scarce and very rare, not many of them survive the attacks of their long rivaled enemies:
Mutants.
They're grotesque, but some don't even have any as it has been ripped clean from their skin. Their many quarrels amongst themselves have weakened them, leaving only the strongest and most fearsome to rule the forest. Primitive. Their name is Lupus, beyond the size of even the largest of wolves. If the bones of the dead, the ancestors of these creatures were found, they would be able to snap the largest in two with little hesitation. Fearsome teeth glisten with the smell of rotting flesh as they break through underbrush. They don't work well together, either. The horrid nature repels even those of their own family.

 The huts made of elephant's ear leaves carefully break through the grassy clearing, allowing the starry light to settle upon the sleeping forms huddling against each other for warmth. They've not had one tribe member leave in a while, though that changes tonight.
The little shadow of  a 15 year old boy  moves silently through the long grass, gathering, and escaping. The tribes have never felt safe in the ruins of the buildings, their place belongs among the plants where their safety is assured. Because the old ruins are where the bodies are, or what's left of them after the Lupus have reached them.

The boy moves solemnly, tears dripping off his thin face. How could he have forgotten the one he called his sister, the friend who sacrificed his arm to Lupus for him to escape. But after tonight, they won't remember him either.

One such person was Harvey Matthews. Mr. Matthews was exceptionally ordinary. He was always neatly dressed; a perfectly arranged bowtie nestled at his neck. Mr. Matthews arose every morning at precisely 7:15. At precisely 7:17 Mr. Matthews allowed himself a total of four minutes to groom himself for the coming day.

Evie’s eyes scanned the faded colours and engraved words of the books on the shelves. The familiar titles seemed to smile out at her like old friends. Evie is an avid reader. She spent a lot of time alone, Evie used books to fill the silence of her home.

Her imagination is her best, but other little children found her odd. It may have been the way she dressed; her parents too busy with work, Evie dressed herself every day. She favoured bright colours and patterns and therefore wore as many as she could. It may have been the way she would sit on her own at recess, a book in her lap, humming and smiling up at the sky. It may have been the way her hand was always first in the air to answer the teacher’s question. Or it easily could have been the inevitability of children to dislike anyone that is different.

The shopkeeper gazed over his thick-framed glasses at the girl. She was facing him; he could see her through the shelf. She looked up from the book she had been perusing 

“Do you ever wish you could bring books to life?” Evie said in a wistful voice.

The shopkeeper stared right at her. His sparkling hazel eyes seemed to betray his age. They bore into Evie’s own blue eyes. A curious sensation seemed to come over Evie. The tips of her fingers became very cold and the ends of her toes became very warm. The air around her seemed to waver and shimmer. As quickly as it had come on, there was no title on the inside page either.

We all had different titles, she would sit at the table with the spoon in her mouth, writing tales of young clever girls who were brave enough to conquer demons and destroy gender-roles. She mystified dragons and played with mermaids until her prince came along. She became a housewife. Now she sits on porch with a cigarette in one hand and mewling baby in the other. The youngest, she's the Artist. Her Dionysian view through a cracked bitter lens keeps her young mind fresh and arrogant. She's off to college next fall, with high hopes and a higher nose. She looks down on those who can manage to remove themselves from the singular objective that is the ego. Self-centered is apparently 'in' this season.

**Prologue**

Seven years ago

His counsel was ridiculed by his colleagues

Avaro walked into the circular chamber, and realized that the major scientific and political leaders from around the world were gathered together.

As he took his place in the center of the room, Avaro realized that all those in the chamber had gone silent, having noticed his arrival, and were either staring directly at him or at a panel opposite them.  He faced the Moderator and nodded his readiness.

""Professor Avaro

""Exalted Moderator, yet I find myself confused as to what transgression has caused you to summon  me.""  Avaro stood straight, just as defiant today as he'd been seven years ago when he'd been excommunicated from the scientific community, laughed out of the room by many of the same people in the audience today.

It was the Moderator who broke her gaze

Avaro controlled his surprise as well as a small flicker of hope that they may now heed his warning.

""Seven years ago, and we treated you, "" she paused, ""poorly.""

Avaro let out a laugh

""You are right, and what now appears to have been a foolish disregard of the message you brought.  We, today, invited government representatives from around the world to hear what you had to say and do our best to redress our mistake of seven years past.  We....and I apologize, and while I know that does not assuage the damage we may have done to you personally,  we hope you will again assume your place with us.""

Moderator Backar looked at him

""Moderator Backar

There was a shuffling around the room

""When you last visited us, that we refused to listen to you with the respect you had already earned and by not considering your data seriously, we made a grave error we hope you can now help us remedy, if possible. Over the past three months, the very environmental changes you predicted would occur have begun to happen and we realize now that you were right. We also hope that you have continued to research and analyse what data you were able to collect and have a more optimistic outlook than that you gave us previously.""

""Moderator Backar, impressed with your ability to  speak so eloquently while saying very little of substance.""  The audience began talking in urgent whispers, stunned at the disrespect shown their leader.  Avaro, though, didn't wait for the Moderator to signal silence or respond, ""Seven years ago, I came to you to warn that our atmosphere was going to significantly change and today you tell me this change is now beginning.  It is very true that my assessment of data ran contrary to the accepted interpretations, but do not excuse, and the task of continuing my research near impossible.  You took the data and analysis I did then

Avaro continued after a ten second pause where he looked slowly around at his audience,"" he said to the discouraged face of the Moderator, ""but I do not believe that would have changed anything based on what little I was able to learn since then.  It is my belief that we cannot slow, stop, or reverse the process that is beginning now.  I suspect you have access to my previous report.""

Backar nodded in return, well, for the first time since last week, but lack your expertise.  If we have interpreted the data accurately and if the formula you developed provide a reasonably close estimate, we have entered stage four on your timeline.""

Avaro nodded sadly.  ""Then I am not certain what I can do for you. I am not a practical scientist, analysed trends and made predictions that proved true.  I cannot reverse the situation.  I share your concern, and I share your fears and sadness.  If, as you say, we have reached stage four, we have fewer than eight years before we reach stage eight, and I know of no way to prevent that.""

The Moderator nodded at him, as a people, can continue existing beyond the next eight years. We recognize that the time for analysis of what is happening has changed and analysis of data stretching back more than seven years matches your predictions to within three percentage points.""  She took a drink from a glass hidden behind her podium.  ""You demonstrated, those many years ago, an ability to see beyond accepted doctrine; your new theories proved out to better explain more than four centuries of climate data than the theories we'd followed for those four centuries. We hope you can apply the same facility of looking outside the box to the problem of our survival of a species.""

The chamber was deathly silent

""There

***

The last of the arks left the gravitational pull of the planet eight years and three days later.  Tens of thousands of the vessels had been launched over the last two years; changes were constantly being added to the manufacturing process as each was built and not only their physical construction was changed, and consignment .  Every variation was designed to increase the likelihood of success, but Avaro would never know which, if any, would actually succeed.

Avaro looked down as he lost sight of that last ship in the night sky. In the last months, they'd never know.

He walked back inside his office, his elbows on the desk, and then, for the first time since he was a child, he buried his face in his hands and sobbed.

What is death? This is a question that has plagued humanity for years
Death always appears at sunrise. He leaves his gratifying touch on someone, as his kingdom seems very inviting after years of battling Life. 
His realm is vast land that changes for every person. Those who have willingly come to Death, pale and inviting, as if they will finally be at peace. Those who have died as a sacrifice, in order to save others, receive a hero’s welcome, with red and gold banners hanging from luxurious mansions. But those with a heart of stone, who only practice to deceive, and tossed into Death’s hands. There
But Death himself is not scary. He is a young boy, appearing differently to everyone, ready to carry them from the mortal world. But no matter his shape, there is always something about him, so old, so wise, it cannot be hidden. This is what strikes fear in a person’s heart
Death is destined to live alone, but instead of a scythe he carries an enchanted box which holds a wisp of hair from his great love. She was the old woman. When she realized Death could never live in the mortal world, she never saw him again.

The evening rain gently hits my face as I walk down Eleventh Street and Gilden Avenue. It's about Nine-Thirty P.M. This isn't good. I need to find my prey before Ten.

""Okay ma-ma."" The boy says back. He's exactly what I'm looking for.

Now or never
into your hands. Kill them. Now.

""As you wish."" I respond to the voice. I then walk over to the mother. ""Excuse me, and slash her throat in one quick and fluent motion. after doing this, her blood spatters all over my face and partially onto my hoodie. And before little Billy can scream, or even move, I put my hand over his mouth and place the knife against his throat. I then pull him into the dark depths of the alley that is behind us. Once at the end of the alley,I throw him into the wall on my left. This breaks the boy's nose on impact and causes him to bleed profusely.

""OWW!"" He screams while covering his nose. After he pulls his hands away from his face, I manage to grab him by pulling him to my body and covering his mouth. He starts emitting muffled screams.

""Shh, but he's not yet dead. SO I take the knife and start moving it back and forth on his throat. ""I'll sing for you Billy. C'mon, listen to me sing."" I say over his violent gurgles as he starts to bleed out.

""You are my sunshine, how much I love you. Please don't take my, sunshine away."" By the time I'm done singing, Billy has finally died. After pulling my knife away, I feel his body drop, but not his head. I open my eyes to the realization that I had cut straight through his spine. This caused his decapitation. I take his disembodied head from my chest, and drop it onto his fallen body.

After dropping Billy's head, I take my knife and slice my finger tips. This so that it looks like I cut myself on the razor barbed wire fence in front of me. I then climb the fence, stick my left thigh on one of the razors, and then purposely fall. I most likely slipped one of my discs, but that is the price I must pay. I then get up, stick my three middle fingers into Billy's pool of blood, and rub it all over the front of my hoodie. I wipe the blood on my pant leg, I find just that. That is where I place the knife. I then place the brick back.

I have probably Five seconds 'til the police car drives by and see the carnage that has happened. I hear the sirens get closer

""Nine-One-One

""Oh God

""Sir

""I'm - argh

""Okay

1375978835.0,1jyp0y,[Feedback] Mississippi Werewolf Hunter,DustinAmodeo,7,3,2,"Something that I'm working on to break up the monotony of writing my other novel. Thoughts?

The dog in this story does not die. When I do occasionally read me a story that doesn’t just have pictures in it, but I’d probably offend someone if I told you it. I always try not to offend people. What I don’t get, however, is why in the fuck they have decided that killing a dog is any better than killing a person. People are awful creatures that do awful things. All that dog does is whatever its owner tells him to-- 

Sorry. I’ve gotten carried away. Let me try again.

While a whole shitload of savage werewolves will certainly meet their untimely end (usually at the hands of my spike laced baseball bat)

Trying to figure out where and how to begin a story such as this has been very difficult, too. I don’t think it is very important, giving my occupation, to be a good writer. But, as I sit in my living room with a fresh frozen pizza sitting in front of me, I find myself itching to start telling my story.

My name is Dale, and multiply the “so bored I’ve contemplated gouging my eyeballs out” by a factor of ten and you can get a pretty good idea of what Watiba is like. Miles and miles of fields only broken up by the occasional dirt road that is connected to another dirt road that is connected to yet another dirt road before it connects to a two lane road with a Piggly Wiggly on the corner. I’m saying there ain’t much here. You get used to it though, I suppose. At least as used to it as you get to getting root canals, I would expect. I live alone in a small one story house. It is green. Ugly green that always seem to draw comparisons to the color of Linda Blair’s projectile vomit in The Exorcist. I live alone, except for McClane. He is pretty good company. He kind of looks like a cross between a German Shepherd and Shih Tzu, if you can picture it. I hope that his mama was the German Shepherd because if it was the other way around I can’t imagine her living to give birth to him as big as he is.

I got me a friend, but I’m not going to call him Dan. I read a book before I started writing this story out that taught me that publishers don’t much like to read stories that have two people with similar names in it. Something about it not being clear to the reader who is who. Or is it who is whom? Either way, it didn’t really make much sense to me, because I know that I’m Dale and I know that he is Dan, but I for damn sure ain’t writing this just for shits and giggles so I’m going to call him Todd instead. That should be different enough that y’all can tell the difference.

I told you earlier that I kill werewolves for a living. That was both the truth and a lie all at the same time. Actually, people just started turning up missing. Keep in mind that only about 300 people even live here, so when a few people turn up gone you can bet that everybody in town knows about it. And hell, at this point, we’ve lost about 30 people. That’d be the same as a big town, like Atlanta, losing about 300, I think. 

Like I said


I.
Todd and I had just finished watching Die Hard for about the umpteenth time one evening about a year ago when I suddenly had me a hankering for a glass of bourbon. We loaded up into his old Dakota pick-up truck and decided to head into town to get us a bottle of Tennessee’s Finest. Just to make that clear for you, we were heading to the store to get us a fresh bottle of Finest when what looks like one of them cute little furry guys from Star Wars comes running out into the middle of the road. Todd slammed on the brakes just in time to miss this cute little mother fucker, and when I looked at him, I could have sworn I could actually see the exact moment that his asshole finally unpuckered. Todd and I both are real softies for animals, you see.

“Dale

“It looked like one of them little furry things from Star Wars!”

“You mean an Ewok?” Todd has always had a better memory than I do.

“Yeah

“Dale

“I don’t know

“Well stop it.”

“Ok

“God dammit

So I rolled down the window so that I could reach out and pull the door handle open. For some reason or another Todd’s truck can’t be opened on the passenger side from the inside. Todd put the flashers on the truck and I waddled over to the side of the road and there he was, instead, when I reached my hand down to check on him this little dog stood up, growled, and charged at me. No, that isn’t right. He didn’t charge at me, he charged through me. That may sound weird, but at something that was over my shoulder. I crouched just in time to see his balls barely clear my head as he took off back across the street. 

“Todd

My eyes followed his gaze, or like it might have been at one time, but its back was bent at an impossible angle, and it made a high pitched noise as it raced towards our new friend in arms.

“Todd

“Why are you yelling again

“You don’t think this is a good time to yell?”

I lunged myself back to the cab and grabbed Todd’s twelve gauge Remington, chambered a round, and aimed at the chest of this beast.

“Pull!” yelled Todd.

“What? Why is it ok when you yell?”

Before Todd could answer, now two distinct different chunks, fell to the ground. Our Ewok friend stopped with a start, looked confused for a moment, and then took a shit directly on the head of the beast. 

“Good dog.” Todd and I both said at the same time. It was clear that this was our kind of friend.

“What was that thing

“The hell if I know

“Get the flashlight.”

Todd recovered his Mountain Dew LED flashlight from the glove box as we approached the head of whatever the fuck this thing was.

“Is it a Sasquatch?” I asked.

“Don’t be silly, though.” I realized that perhaps this entire time I really was the smarter of the two of us.

“Bigfoot is a Sasquatch

“I thought a Sasquatch was a vegetable.”

“That’s a squash

“I think both are correct.” I gave up trying to explain.

As we approached the head of this thing, I, and our furry friend all looked down into the eyes of what can only be described as a werewolf. I would love to give you some long description of his teeth being as sharp as razor spikes or his eyes looking like evil itself, but at this point there wasn’t much scary about this thing. And the longer we stared at it, the less scary it became. That isn’t to say that we got used to what it looked like, but that it literally became less horrifying by the moment. It was changing, quite rapidly, began to shrink to their normal size. 

“Holy shit! It’s Deacon Brown!”

“You’re yelling again

I chose to whisper instead.

“Holy shit

“How can you stay so calm at a time like this!”

“I fucking hate you

“You killed Deacon Brown

“You saw that thing before it turned into him

“Oh. Yeah, right?”

“I don’t know

“We hide this thing and we get the hell out of here

“I really wish McClane hadn’t taken a shit on him if we are going to have to touch him.”

“McClane?”

“Yeah

“He’s like John McClane, in a foreign place with only himself he could depend on. And when things started looked bad, he didn’t run away from it. He stood up for himself, and proved that he could handle his business.” By the time I finished, I could see the excitement spreading across Todd’s face.

“Abso-fucking-lutely

“A mascot? For what?”

“You don’t think there’s going to be more of these things

“What are you talking about

“Seriously

He was bewildered and unable to move, dirty flood.

The roaring was very loud and very near

“Flee!” 

Without thinking his feet began to move

He ran.

The avalanche of dirt was on him.

“I can’t make it”

He felt his limbs trembling and singing on a high note. 

Muscles that he was never aware existed worked in perfect

If he wanted to survive

“Be faster than death.”

He dashed deeper

The cave widened a little

He knew

His lungs burned. 

His legs hurt and his heart pushed absurd amounts of blood through his system.

There was only darkness before him and only agony behind him.

“The tunnel crossing is here somewhere.”

If he missed it

He continued his mindless run and almost missed the junction.

When his brain screamed to turn left

Only after he had passed several meters in the upward tunnel

After several more steps he finally stopped and looked behind him.

He saw the water tear away the structures now beneath him

His legs began to move again, and away.

The feeling in his limbs came back

Still he managed to move

“It’s gone!”

He felt the ugly wave of panic drowning his mind again.

The wonderful opening of the upward tunnel was gone

Without a thought, then at an incredible speed.

He felt the pain in his hands when he hit a rock

The water level behind him was already climbing up the tunnel

With almost all his strength gone

It hurt

The strong smell of a hot summer day hit his nose and his lungs.

He almost could not breathe while struggling through the dirt.

His eyes were still useless

With a last mighty push of his hurting legs, I see the mole!”

So this is the void. Or death

I wonder if time’s passing. Maybe I’m just too used to ticking clocks. But there’s this longing in me that doesn’t seem to wear off — in fact it’s getting more and more unbearable with each moment that passes. How long a moment is

I don’t know how long I’ve been here either

All I know is that I can think.

Perhaps this is what I’ve always been

No

Wait, words. A color.

No

The emptiness can’t be red.

My longing grows larger than the darkness. I *am* more than thoughts

Pain. Cold. Paralysis. Ragged breathing.

Not death nor nothingness. Where am I?

“Now

I try to speak. I can’t. I try to move. I can’t.

“He won’t wake up.” A woman’s voice.

“Hush

Sound. Water dripping somewhere to my right.

Thirst. Sore throat

“Hush! Let him.”

How can I be cold with a hot knife piercing through my side?

“Water.” It hurts too much to speak. I wonder if I can swallow. “Please… water.”

At first there’s no response, moistness trickles down my chin. Soft fingers force my mouth open for the blessing to touch my tongue. Not nearly enough.

“More…” I’ll beg if I have to.

“Easy

This time I can move my arms

“Easy

I won’t take it slow. She doesn’t know how much I need this. I upend the cup.

Now I’m drowning.

Strong hands grab me by my shoulders and sit me up

“She said easy. Let’s try again

He won’t let go. Why is he holding me?

I feel something tied around my head. Bandages? The smell of blood and waste almost overwhelms me when I finally notice it. I recall I should be bleeding

“I can’t see.”

This is no bandage

“No need to see anything right now.” His grip tightens. “It’s no use to struggle.”

“Save your strength for later.” She does sound like she cares. “You’ll need it.”

Who are these people?

“I demand to know where I am!” The authority in my voice surprises me. It seems unwarranted. The pathetic order of a broken man.

“You’re in no position to demand anything

Hand 052.

All those memories suddenly flood my mind again. The nightmare in the void. It *was* a nightmare

No amount of wishing can transform the past in a bad dream.

In the wake of the sudden realization

My body goes limp; tears stream from my eyes. This man is right: it’s no use to struggle. It doesn’t matter where I am or who they are.

That sword should have killed me. Why didn’t it? What happened then?

The woman lays me back down. “Rest now. Your questions will be answered in time.”

“It’s not answers I need. Just leave me here to die.”

The man chuckles. “You can be sure we’ll kill you if need be. Not here

“Who’s Ard?” They don’t answer. I shrug

A soft hand raises my head. “Here.” She grips my hair when I turn my lips away. “It’s just water. I know you want it.”

I’m still wary

“You aren’t dying

Cef snorts. “You’re lucky Sia has a soft spot for broken people. Messenger or no

“Who *are* you?” Instead of replying

Time seems to go slower and slower as those scenes keep replaying in my head

Just when I’m thinking the sound of dripping water will drive me crazy, but whether it is from the lack of a fire or from some fever, I don’t know.

“At last I meet our famed Messenger, Hand 052.”

I hear soft chuckles from all around me. Six people

How long have I been sleeping?

“Very well, at your service. May I know your name? I don’t want to keep addressing you as a number. After what you did, you certainly earned being more than that to me.”

I remain silent. Someone starts tapping their foot.

“You’ll talk to me, there’s a city I must—”

Hurried steps come from behind Ard along with a very young voice. A girl.

“Chief Beetle

“I’ll go see them in a minute. You did well.” His attention turns back to me. “The sooner you talk, you can be sure of that. We must finish what you started.”

When I refuse to speak

Who *are* these people?

He woke some time in the night to the sound of thunder and rain as it poured down on the thatch roofing and sprayed the stone walls of the house. He discovered he was naked beneath the wool blankets. The cot he lay on was stiff

He sat up and immediately regretted it. The pain in his left arm was excruciating and he lay back down. It was bandaged and a makeshift sling held it across his chest. The bandage was fresh linen and smelled of herbs. When he peeked beneath the bandages he saw that his wounds had been cleaned and even sewn shut. *No thief would tend me so*

Briefly he considered escaping into the night and finding his way back to the road

Only once more did he wake up in the night and only partially. He thought he saw the girl — *Tani, he hardly remembered at all.

The storm was gone and sunshine flooded in through the window at the far end of the room. It was a feed room, the girl came in with a wood bowl and spoon. She placed it on a chair that she dragged over and left it by his side.

“Eat that

“Help?” he grunted, I need some help with the chores. Ain’t no one else gonna do’em. Soon as you get well, soon as you help.”

Paul blanched. “Chores? I don’t do chores girl. Do your own bloody work, slamming the door to the main house shut behind her.

Paul sighed and looked at the seat where the remains of his breakfast was quickly sliding off the edges of the chair and onto the dirt floor. His stomach twisted into a hungry knot and he quickly glanced to the door before he took his spoon and scooped what he could right off the seat. The act made him feel pathetic but he consoled himself that getting strong and getting out of here was more important than pride.

As he was shoving the last bit of salvageable porridge into his mouth, I had to burn them this morning. These were my da’s. He wasn’t much bigger than you, I think.” She came near to the foot of his make-shift bed and placed them on a feedbag. Paul pushed himself up onto an elbow and stared at her. He opened his mouth but found he had nothing to say and closed it again.

“I apologize for that earlier

“M’lord should rest, the girl was gone.

For the rest of the day Paul slipped in and out of sleep. His pain came in unending waves that made sitting up difficult. Occasionally Tani — her name, a foul smelling concoction she said would help it fight off infection and help with the pain.

The pain never ended and the poultices smelled worse than an infection ever would

During his stay in the room, she spoke quietly and deferentially to him but always with an undercut of scorn. He tried to speak to her like he did with the servants at Hallow Hill. *They were nice folk and I treated them well, why does she hate me so?*",,False,,t5_2tl2y,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j6zel/feedback_hallow_hill_part_6_continuing_my_gritty/

1374404733.0,1iqutk,[Feedback] Down Part 2,Punyesh,7,3,6,"Reese woke up in the gutter.

It is generally not considered a good thing to wake up in the gutter if one has been sober.

Fortunately

He reached into his coat and found a bottle of Whisky.

Specifically Bearhuggers’ Whisky.

He opened it with his right hand and took a sip. 

It tasted like sticky horse piss

The real problem with drinking

With a little effort he climbed out of the gutter and started walking up the sidewalk.

It was midnight. So

That however

The coat just happened to be in the car when he stole it.

The rest of his clothes were more of the same

So

He stopped for a second and looked around.

He then made his way to the dumps around the Diner.

A woman came out of the hospital. She was walking in his direction. She seemed a bit worried and in a hurry. She looked like she’d been crying.

Well

He decided to try his hand.

‘Any change miss?’ he asked.

She looked at him.

‘Huh…? Oh yes’ said Jane as she put some change into his hand and continued down the road to her car.

‘Thanks’.

As he was putting the change in his pocket he felt something unusual in the palm of his hand. He took it out and looked at it.

It was a key, but she was already long gone. He turned his eyes back to his hand.

Well

He’d be in and out

‘Well…why not ?’

But that's why Roger couldn't stand her. As she strutted from plebeian to plebeian pretending to commiserate with their inconveniences and chuckling hollowly at their awful jokes

It was certainly subtle. You had to look past her actions and question her motives. Why did she blush with every compliment? Why did she offer to help cute boys study? Why, virtuous individual? Not when they're to garner attention and satiate her edacious ego.

When it came to guys, lavishly deny their claims, and, after unctuously telling them how much she appreciated the offer, say no. That way, she'd always be desirable (guys want what they can't have, right?)

And it worked. Vanessa had plenty of top-notch suitors, none had been worthy of her. She did, however, feel like the hottest shit on the planet. Guys sent her flowers, chocolates, poems, and snapchats and she flitfully played along, she became irritated. Her teeth grinding together, fall in love for the first time. But as soon as her subsequent batted eyelashes, confidently returned to her throne of superiority

So what is a victim of this supposed cycle to do? In Roger's case, and his eyes will track her relentlessly across the room, but he will not utter a word. After all, no one can prove your error if you hide it and demonizing Vanessa is easier than accepting personal failure.

Speedway

I sit on the floor beside my chaise lounge listening  
to the wailing of Sonny Rollins’ sax
the bronzed notes haunt the air from a 1988 remastered vinyl imprint of a 1959 recording
which I found on Amazon one day while skimming
of a work-away day on my laptop in 2012. The thick 180-gram disc turns  
and turns on a Crosley table
with the “The Wheel in the Sky” too
My mobile vibrates
and that means that the buzzing market is cornered by the pack of Indy Cars  
circling the IMS like a swarm of enraged hornets revolving around some nest  
made of metal and fiberglass at the center of the infield. The center of the infield is not  
a beehive
its verdant fairways and tidy
with shallow ponds of sand and strands of scraggly weeds which players’ call  
“the rough.”

I’ve only been golfing once and I imagine the intended tranquility of the sport  
would be spoiled by the roar of Indy Car engines and the smell of bald rubber tires  
burning on the pavement. But I’ve only been golfing once
My aunt was worried that the local pizzeria on Main Street
surfer-bum and painter, but  
no one shops on Main Street in Speedway
I dare you to point to a town that better encapsulates the spirit of the Midwest than Speedway.

Race weekend is a rager
The cars on the track,  
wrapped up like fire-proof corporate bulletin boards
can keep pace with the technological edge that seems to slice by the finish line  
on a record lap time each year. And yet these high-octane computerized rolling darts  
find themselves snared by the lax orbit of Speedway. A showcase of dichotomy:  

sweating in August
drunk and wheezing Saturday night
future home to a wind tunnel and a roundabout. A high-tech hamlet encased in the old amber  
of the 20’s
of criss-crossing narrow streets and mandated that every new home include an enclosed garage  
because Speedway would be a city of the future and the future was one  
where automobiles dominated the streets.  

Lawns mowed
and feeders for the cardinals from their porches.   
Police patrolling in new Dodge Chargers the color of polished onyx.  
Stone-and-mortar buildings
The Red Box on Crawfordsville Road. A merry-go-round of fireworks   outlets and discount tobacco shops and poorly-stocked convenience stores all taking turns trying their hand  
in the same low-traffic
Maybe I’m fooling myself when I say I don’t need a John Cougar Mellencamp record.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hz3kl/speedway_a_long_poem_about_the_my_hometown/

I have been meaning to write something for a long time, and I'm not sure if I made them obvious enough - I'm also not sure if it's obvious enough what exactly happens at the end
__________________________________________________________

**Green Tomatoes [by Ed Lawes]**

The smell of salt and the distant cries of seagulls cut through the creaks and groans of a small house settling in the wind. At the end of its garden a woman stepped out from inside a faded greenhouse. The soles of her wellington boots became caked in wet, then using the edge of the concrete paving outside the porch to wipe the muck off her boots.

“I wish you’d stop doing that

“Stop what?”

“Stop watering those damn tomatoes. It’s nearly September. They’re not going to ripen now. Let them wither.”

She sighed and shook her head

He said nothing, the sea breezes and the salty soil stopped anything he planted from growing much, instead producing a pitifully small harvest or simply dying. The vegetable patch he had dug when they first arrived had long since grown over, and the fruit cage was cracked and had rusted to a deep brown colour, its bare metal stung by the salty wind. He never had been much of a horticulturist, and it was too late to start.

She walked back in from the kitchen. “I’m off out to my pottery class. I’ll make sure to pick up some more eggs and milk on the way back. Oh – and Stuart and Patricia called; they’d love to have us over for dinner sometime. I thought that would be a lovely idea.” She waited for a response. “Frank?”

“Oh. Yes. I’m sure that would be fine.” 

“I’ll call them then. I do wish you’d stop leaving the paper lying on the chair like that – you know how the ink rubs off on the fabric

He lifted the pages a few inches upwards.

“Thank you. I’ll be back in an hour.”

She had always wanted to retire to a bigger house than this. Living here, but near the city, so she could keep in touch with her many friends. They had wanted somewhere with plenty of space for their children and their families to visit. That was no longer an issue: their son had not been a part of their lives since he left to go to university abroad, and the annual Christmas cards, a cordial formality, had ceased arriving several years ago. He didn’t know anything about his only child. It was his own fault – if only he’d spent more time with him – with both of them – and less time working, perhaps… But it was far too late to change it now. There was barely enough time left to mourn these things.

She’s so frail now. She shuffles around slowly, beautiful brown eyes now drooping and watery. They blink back at him with a mournful sadness. There used to be so much life in those eyes. He could stare at them for what felt like hours, losing himself in her, before the tinkle of her laugh cut through his reverie as she blushed, unable to bear the intensity of his gaze. Then he would kiss her and hold her and they would be together and that would be all they needed.

Outside, and he could see white breakers rushing towards the shore across the simmering grey sea. He knew that this was how it ended. He sighed heavily. This wasn’t right. He had worked in the city, dreaming new ideas for new companies in new offices, their employees living in new houses. It was exciting, it was fresh, and it was free. He gets home after work to a loving wife who kisses him on the cheek, and his son, then a baby, green garden with roses growing up a trellis on the back wall. They talk together late at night of moving into the suburbs with the hushed excitement of those who believe – those who know – that their lives can only continue to improve.

He got up and stood for a moment standing in front of the window, the sound replaced by the scratching of his breathing and the muffled thudding of his laboured footsteps. He put the kettle on. Last week he had glimpsed her crying in the bedroom, sitting on his side of the bed. She must have left the door open so he would see her there – so he would come and console her and fix what was broken and right the wrongs he had done her. But although he was sure she heard his rasping breaths behind her, he did and said nothing. He knew she could no longer stand him. He knew that the reason she retreated to the greenhouse every afternoon was just to be away from him, to have some respite from his presence. She used to leap adoringly into his arms. Now, he had become the failure he hated, and he knew she despised him for it. Only a curious sense of duty and an illusion of integrity kept her from leaving.

The kettle came to the boil

“I’m back. Tea? Perfect timing!” She smiled, sitting down.

“Nobody can see it, but lowered her eyes and exhaled. She took a sip of the tea.

And now it’s winter in Glasgow, a light dusting of snow topping the roof and windowsills, and her holding onto his arm as they stare at it, not quite ready yet to open the door with the key they’ve been given and call it theirs. She holds a little tighter. This is not yet the dream, but this is where it starts. He looks at her and she turns to look back. “Thank you,” she whispers, and that is enough. 

He sees her across the dance floor, and they dance and they laugh and they leave at the end of the evening and sit in his car overlooking the city like the cliché he never thought was real and she looks at him and he knows she’ll always be there now he’s found her, that she’ll never leave so long as he loves her enough, and he promises to her then that he’ll never stop loving her, that he’ll give her the life she wants if he can be a part of that life. And that is how it began.

She leaned in to look at him and stare into his eyes as her eyes grew wide, and watching as he let her beauty slowly turn into a frail shadow of its former self, he was finally making amends. A small cough escaped her mouth as she fell forwards. He moved off the chair onto his knees to catch her and clutched her to his chest. He stroked her thin hair with his trembling hand, and a tear rolled down his cheek. This was what she wanted, and this was what she deserved. 

He can hear both their heartbeats. They merge and separate in long, fully round, back into his. Her mouth is a perfect O. She brings her arm up to touch his face, her hand shaking, and he touches it to his cheek. It begins to grow cold. 

He knows he can never redeem his failure in the past to give her the love he promised. In so many ways has he failed her. But now,,False,,t5_2tl2y,1371659302.0,,True

Why can’t I stop? I know Samantha could be my future, she rolls over next to him and smiles innocently. As they begin to talk about their previous night togethcer, Rebecca notices a long strand of hair in the bed that belongs to neither David nor her.

David doesn’t know what to do or say, as he searches for the right words, a loud knock is heard on the door. David and Rebecca freeze. Another knock is heard. “David it’s me, are you there, it seems she has a key. David immediately jumps up and shuts the door and links the chain that connects the door to the wall. “I’ll be there in a second!” he says nervously.

You perpetually move forward, look back to see the long years of your life, then look forward and know what is waiting for you. Days become weeks become months become years becoming and going til they all slide by as if they had somewhere to be. They wait for no one, especially you, as the hands keep on turning and the tide keeps on rolling in. Where does the time go, where were you when it was here? 

Time goes nowhere you haven't been. It sits, content with its unwavering stare. Meanwhile you divide it up, marking it left and right, figuring out how to spend it. You sell it like a commodity and then wait for it when you have no more left. You breathe it in and spit it out when you've used it up, taking it for granted. It doesn't care though, because what are you, to it? Just another short lived fly

Is time alive? Can time think and feel? What does it mean to truly live? Can you see it, if they have no meaning? Can you even know what time is?

Time is every moment you've ever lived up to now – everything you've ever done or said, the wrinkles on your hand. Time is August 30th, 1984 when U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery takes off on its maiden voyage. Time is the Gregorian calender, the hourglass, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. 

Time is the frame of everything around us

The time you have is a blessing.

The time you've lost is a curse.

You live to die and die to live, growing mentally. You expand and develop, teaming with an aura of sentience in everything you do. You stabilize, your actions become habits and your habits become your life, unfolding in unavoidable circumstance. You wait, bracing yourself for the inevitable collapse of your own ruin. You die, decaying physically, shrinking into the creases of your skin

It's the supposed time limit which makes life so precious. Life without death isn't life at all. This value of life creates a value of self

The world is spinning. You look up and see everyone else, the footsteps taking you to and from the corners of living. At one point these people tried to live, now they just try to survive. You realize that time stops for no one. We're swarmed by a wave of bullshit, dictating what can and cannot be, surrounded by an endless pressure to conform. Cut your hair short, put on makeup, take your pills

And all this time

Someone at my school got hit by a fucking car. Someone I knew overdosed alone in their apartment. Someone I met took a bullet in the chest in Afghanistan and never came back. Someone I saw hung themselves out of desperation. Someone's Grandfather just died

Their family

and here we are, listening to music, pissed over something so trivial but right now it seems so important. Time is the devourer of all things, it flies and ends unexpectedly, even though it continues on without you. Life is the time you hold closest to you. Your life makes up this time through the will of the surface values of your conscious mind. Live your life, live your time, live your mind, eat,,False

Shapes form, shaving lines; stars and stripes of lesser known variants.  Quadrants collide and equally divide with a total loss of identity, yet remaining the same, fresh smorgasbords of prisms of spatial deformity. Miscellaneous homogeneous landscapes spanning eras of time, one forgetting the other. Lights shines around the corners, leaking in from the hazed backing of sight, a murky reminder of an alternative world waiting on the other side. 

Tangible swirls of uniform color fades as shapes cascade against each other, motion weld in occurrence. Limbs sprawl and grab at the edges of the universe, tugging at the fabric of reality, nevertheless trapped by the boundaries of limit.

People bash to and fro as they swarm from assorted clusters of buildings and domiciles

Individuality streams from seams of littered fabric as they are live and return to the tapestry of life. Live and breathe, your parents, government officials, what makes their existence any different than yours. You are all part of the same inevitable reality of perception, spinning on a rock within a prism of the universe.

Leave the phantom hourglass that is life and see for yourself what lies in the parallel darkness.

Color interacts with surrounding light, cordial reflected light bouncing off other objects; what you see may not be what you perceive. The nature of existence is reliant on the ability to perceive physical objects. All things and experiences are impermanent within your own conditioned phenomena.   

Everything is in a constant flux, which leaves you to the connection of your mind. Your mind is filled with bad abstraction. Tangents that go off into nowhere, bad habits of repeating yourself and deja vu. The locus of your being is the communicative event of the language that you use. What you feel, what you think and do comprise your own reality, yet the reality in your mind is formed by the mere awareness of conscious thought. Language shapes the thought process into questioning the inexhaustible meaning of being; you project self as your body, your hands, your legs, anger, so whats to say matter is just another facade of reality? You can reproduce matter on the television

You're a product of genes and adopted stance. You are a idea-replicator producing itself in a new host. You are the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs. A tangible mass of protein strings. An out of body experience. A phantom in the shade.  

Tryptonauts, Mysticism, Gnosticism, Monism, whatever you like. Then come down to the awakening sensation intrinsically embedded in the human psyche: where the false version of our true selves no longer serve itself; look at things as they are, as we are, a multiconscious trip cascading through the cosmos.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1cwq5w/the_tangible_concept_of_reality/

I'm looking for general feedback on my voice

Thank you.

“Chapter twelve, so, yeah. It is way passed bedtime.

This means Julia Hodgekins is lying on the floor

This means Brett Carter is squealing into the drooped ear of his dogged mommy.

This means I’m losing my frigging mind.

I’m losing it

My jaw winds up. The metal coils lodged in the back of my gums twist and my teeth grind together. Sore muscles on the side of my jaw bulge with every frustration of this perfectly annoying night. My one night with Annetta this week had to be P.T.A. night. My least favorite night as a kid and still my least favorite night as an adult.

Gently rub the sides of your cheeks in a counter-clockwise motion. Separate your teeth. Unclench your jaw. Let it all melt away. This is three weeks and five paychecks’ worth of muscle relaxation therapy at work. Stress reduction therapy

On the walls are posters full of primary colors, and messy handprints of all the kids. These are the only worthwhile distractions in the room besides the wood building blocks in the back, and those are strictly off-limits until recess. Little Annetta drifts in and out of consciousness, her head rests on my leg. 

You can only stare at pink piglets and yellow bananas and basic arithmetic for so long before all you can see is red. My mouth is a vice.

Simon Costen sits crossed-legged on the foamy carpet and follows hand spaceships that whiz through his little pair of trainer specs. Simon’s carbon-copy of a father balances his boney ass on one of the doll-sized plastic chairs they gave us to sit on. His wiry frame shoots up like a rod straight to an undeniably formidable moustache. On a bad day.

The man’s eyes are like his son’s

Julia Hodgekins pounds the carpet.

I glance over, he mouths. Fuck this, I’m out. The man grabs little Simon’s flying hand, and lifts him off the ground like a crane. Simon’s legs just hang there, his eyes still gaze into outer space and the bottoms of his sneakers blink.

Our decrepit captor shoots those two glassy cataract-speckled eyes straight at Mr. Costen

“Excuse me, I was already losing it. This little scene is pushing me over the edge of social sanctity. Everybody is trained in on Craig, anticipating his next move. Simon just hangs there.

And Craig Costen, all without making a single sound. He completely stonewalled it. This man is a rock. An urban legend. Put him and that legendary ‘stache on a calendar for a life-altering contest immediately.

Ms. Milburn lets out something like a forced wheeze.

Craig Costen

Inspired

“Absolutely not, moveable walls of the miniature classroom. I freeze, just like Craig did. This is the edge of a wall to the other side. You peek over, just to see how far of a fall down it is. You either suck it up and jump or you back out, crawl down, and accept the same-old.

Everyone watches me, everyone else gets to leave. These are the stakes we’re dealing with here. Craig walking out, that wasn’t enough. Because now he’s just the parent who isn’t getting with the program. But hell, if I walk out of here like this? That pulls the plug. A dam of social anxiety erupts and we all get to float freely back to our homes, far away from the awful Ms. Milburn and another chapter of the Boxcar Children.

Craig Costen was a martyr. And I won’t soon forget his sacrifice. But tonight Craig Costen

Tonight

My body crumbles into a heap of embarrassed and pathetic defeat back onto the orange baby chair. Annetta cradled in my arms

Sofia Marcel’s mother twists her plump and tan and pretty face into a grimace towards me. Nice going

Pops are okay. Clicks you need to watch out for.

“Continuing on,” and she flicks the page.

The walls shook, sending her crashing to the ground again. Pain flared from her shoulder and she cried out, the sound immediately drowned by an explosion. Mortar and dust filled the room and she heard the walls or ceiling crack.

“Help!” she shouted and found the effort of calling out painful as well. When she sucked in breath, courser vapor that quickly filled the room. The room plunged into complete darkness and she screamed for help again and again.

She didn’t know how long she lay there in the dark, barely understood. Those hands turned her over and she saw faces, horrid faces of metal and plastic with large, black eyes and round canisters that made a metallic sucking sound.

Then one of them removed his face, focused light illuminating him from the side. She saw large, dark eyes and shaggy, dark hair that was matted with sweat and something else. He spoke and she recognized him as the boy she’d seen in her room before. The memory felt like a lifetime ago.

“We’re being attacked, quite suddenly, she could see. The room became washed in pale, green light and there was a low hum in her ears. Every time she took a breath, it was accompanied by that metallic sucking sound.

The mask

“Where are we going! What is going on!” she shouted, only some with more beds or other blocky shapes she couldn’t distinguish. Desks or perhaps dressing stations.

Every so often bright lights flashed by in the distant, some with caved skulls while others had great lacerations and punctures through their bodies. In time, Aderyn put together that they were wounds made by ether-lances and ether-blades. The look was too similar to what she’d seen in vids about Wars.

“Be glad you aren’t going little sister

*Kendrick is dead*

And then they were outside and Aderyn saw the star-filled sky dominated by the gas giant of Querra, swallowing them as they pushed into a forest’s edge.

Her legs gave out soon after and she fell

The boy was at her side

“Leave the little spit!” another voice called

“She’s one of us

“Mara’s blood

“Leave off!” the boy shouted and shoved the other woman back. He took Aderyn’s hand in one of his and then used his shoulder to gently guide her to her feet again. “Don’t make me remind you where you came from

“Sure nowhere as soft as this spitting kitten.”

“Can you move?” the boy said, the meager contents in her stomach splashing against the grass at her feet. She tasted nothing but water and bile.

“Come on

“Yes, all right.”

She didn’t know how long they moved through the forest

“Steeds

“Just a little further

A high-pitched whine filled her ears and the woods exploded with light. She covered her eyes with an arm and she heard shouts of pain and surprise spring up all around her. A horrible wind kicked up

“Get down!”

The boy grabbed her and pressed her into the wet grass just as a steed ripped past her head, then it was gone and the knight was thrown backward off the his vehicle, screaming.

“Don’t have too many of those left, crossing back and forth, hiding briefly before moving again. Aderyn quickly lost track of where they were, of which direction was forward or back. Above all she was tired, weary to the point of collapse when the boy finally pulled her into a dark hole in the ground.

He urged her into it first, mud and dirt smearing across her cheek and forehead. She wanted to weep, to cry out in anguish and fear but instead she shook in silence.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1bljp0/the_blood_part_8_serialized_space_opera_novella/

Draft 2 -WIP - FINISHED/Edit in progress


The throne room was massive. From the 20 meter doors, mined from gold deposits in the vacuum of space. The surrounding floor held immense slabs of patterned stones, leading to topaz lined granite walls, and a vertical garden mid-height of exotic plants which grew to the roof a hundred meters high. In the throne sat a man of legend. His legs planted firmly, he dawned a suit of silk and cotton, a neatly wrapped black tie, and a beaver fur cape attached to arctic wolf shoulders. Clipped to his hair and ear on right, his symbol of rule. 


///Scenes Of Power///

i

A fire roared behind the throne, approached The Empirate, and growled a slow, building snare. Rising from his throne he looked on in fascination of the angry animal. ""Ambitious?"" he spoke, standing ever firm. The court guards rushed immediately to the figures, and lifted their weapons awaiting an order or sudden action. ""Stand down."" he spoke again, now leaning nearer slowly putting his hand out for the large cat to sense. In a moment, and bit at The Empirate, he placed his knees on the cheetah's pits and squeezed harder on its throat, bleeding now alarmingly from his shredded wrist. Guards rushed to him once more

ii

Sitting in his throne, with the ambushing moonlight bringing light to all the exposed gems. He feels the weight of the world, the hard choices and his past, always present. ""Pride."" he mumbles to himself. ""I have to move on, I cannot falter."" A separate light fills the night sky, along with roars in the background rippling the air and the ground shook subtly. He stands, straightens his clothes, taking note of each's beauty. A colossal sword posed on his back, a job normally requiring two men, moving forward.

iii

The Empirate stood on the capitol house's back porch with a drink in hand; In front of him his two kids play with new toys. His eldest, and a beautiful woman stepped outside with the guards around the porch respectfully nodding to her. She wore her blonde hair up in a pony tail, which wrapped around her neck and draped over her right shoulder. Her black blouse had scales of gold patterned diagonally from her right down to the adjacent hip and black frilled bottom. She matched it with a simple thin black skirt, and a posture worthy of a statue. Walking over to The Empirate, she kissed him on the cheek, brushed a hair back, and sat in the empty chair beside him. ""Should I prepare the funeral feast for my child?"" she whipped, he rose to stretched. ""Life is good to us now

iv

An explosion ruptured the capitol center's outer walls. Hundreds of guards rushed to the square and approached the battle ready Empirate on one knee. ""Sir!"" one spoke, but fact. If we don't head for the tunnels you will die."" The Empirate stared at the man, familiar with his battle experience all too well, and nodded. ""Then take the tunnels, and meet with my family with the reserves. They're hours from approach, so I don't expect finding them will be hard. Take the white and be safe."" Standing, the guard protested. ""Sir! None of us will leave without you. The artillery will stop and the capitol will be rushed. There is no tact here, he keeled again in apology. More explosions break the sky and shattering rock follow as a thunderesque shadow. ""Fine."" The Empirate conceded. ""My city can be ripped apart, Christouxphr."" he whispered solemnly.

v

""This is it."" a man spoke, a sky blue compliment to his black and white. A flag pin rested slightly slanted on his left breast. As he walked his wife held his hand, their shoes click the tiles and a chill runs down his spine as he starts to hear the crowed echoing from the balcony opening. ""You can always change your mind"" she jokes, ""we could go get lunch or something instead."" He laughs. ""Don't temp me, that's a 'me' thing to do."" She stops him just before walking out, and places a hand on his cheek. ""I love you, and you're going to be great. A short speech, and try not to laugh. That's all you need to remember."" The mans smile was all the reply he gave before turning and walking out into the light. Cheers roared as man at the podium announced,False,

So, and remember, I'm only just starting out!

[Here's](http://gdtthoughtsandmusings.blogspot.com/2013/02/poor-pessimist.html) a link to my blog if you're interested.

----------

A shattered femur, in a way. Nowadays, my dreams aren't anything like they are supposed to be. Everything has changed.

Life is full of problems. I think that how we deal with them has a lot to do with how we got to wherever we were when they reared their ugly heads. How we were brought up. We're all the products of everything--every person

My mother is a disciplinarian and a hard worker. Has been all her life. Her solution to getting slapped in the face isn't to turn the other cheek. No, tell anyone that will listen what you've done. Life is a struggle for my mother. And only the meanest, scrappiest warriors can win.

When I was younger, but I'd never seen her like this. It was frightening. But the next day, she decided to do something about her situation. She put on her best business suit, swooped me up, and took us downtown. I was actually pretty excited. She had always been so busy that we rarely got a chance to visit the city. But the skyline was beautiful. Few things are more wondrous to a small child than a collection of buildings hundreds of times of times taller than he is. But I digress.

My mother went into every building that had a door, and she had probably submitted at least a couple dozen resumes. And all of her hard work and rushing around paid off. She had another job within a week, performing clerical duties for a local hospital. She was even getting paid more than she was at her previous job. ""You see son, life's a bitch,"" she said. ""But you've just got to be ready to be a bitch right back at it.""

They say that opposites attract,"" he would tell me. ""Life isn't hard when you've got Him on your side. A good prayer can fix anything and everything. But you have to trust God. That is the way."" I guess it worked for him. He was never in a bad mood, and good things always happened to him. And even when bad things did eventually come his way, he would suffer them almost happily. He was the grand optimist to my mother's poor pessimist.

He managed to float his way into a position as the CFO of a local insurance company. The fast life of a corporate executive must have made our meager lifestyle seem dull by comparison. I suspect that he just got bored of me and my mother. Soon

So what do I do when faced with the bitchiness of life? Well, if I kept my pace, I definitely had a future in the NFL.

I couldn't keep the pace

One day, and I was on pace to break my own single-game rushing record. And then, a crushing blow from a linebacker changed everything. Until that play in the third quarter, I had a future. But that future is just dust now. Wondering what could have been...it keeps me up at night. Eats at me until there is hardly anything left to gnaw on. But my mother is always there to keep me grounded.

The doctors say that someday, I can kiss that goodbye. If my father were still around, he would probably tell me that everything happens for a reason. That I just need to accept what has happened and pray that God will show me where to go from here. And for the first couple weeks of my recovery, I did just that. I prayed my ass off, hoping that I would hear something.

But all of that prayer brought no solace. I gained no strength from counting the beads on my rosary. No

I guess I take after my mother.",,t5_2tl2y,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/17zdn3/looking_for_critique_for_my_very_short_story_poor/

It seemed pointless to lie there wondering about what hell was going to be like.  It’s like a kid on Christmas Eve who won’t go to bed because he’s too excited about all the over hyped bullshit that he’s going to open the next morning.  He lies awake minute after agonizing minute wishing the night would end so he can terrorize his parents out of bed at an ungodly hour and break into a slew of toys that will entertain him for all of ten minutes.   All the while, because let’s face it, who would a demon like to peel the skin off more than a once was priest who turned homicidal on those assholes who deserved it the most.  
	Twenty nine minutes wasted, blood flowing, temper flaring,  fists clenched eagerly waiting to open my eyes and see Satan himself licking his chops in anticipation.   I shake with anticipation knowing that soon I can look into his eyes and tell him exactly what I’ve said to all those I’ve killed in the last three months.   
“MY NAME IS CONNOR MCCARTHY AND I’M ABOUT TO RUIN YOUR FUCKING DAY. “
	If there is one thing that hindsight has taught me, middle aged shell there was no burning river of fire piloted by Hell’s very own swamp people.  Instead one minute I’m watching my rubber ducky make lazy laps around my blood filled bathtub.  The next I’m staring down a dirty shot glass in some dive bar where the only thing screaming torture is the overinflated prices they’re charging for a beer.   Well that and the waitress, she looked a bit sinful too. 
Ask anyone who knew me back in my living days what my weaknesses were and depending on which version of me they knew, too honest, and too naïve to the real state of the world around me.  Ask those who got the displeasure of knowing me after I witnessed my sisters murder on the steps of that church and you’ll be told of a man whose anger ruled his life, whose hatred had no boundaries.    To read each list would be like reading the failures of two different men because I had in fact led two very distinct lives.   There would be on similarity between them however, on either list anyone who ever knew me could easily tell you that I was a sucker for any woman with a pretty smile and/or a low cut shirt.  The waitress had both. 
Petite yet powerful is the simplest way for me to describe the waitress whose name tag read Llorona. A vision of black hair, soft and supple where it counted.  She was your prototypical Latin beauty. 	 But it wasn’t her Latin “assets” that had drawn me in; there was something about her eyes.   Her body, her posture, her very presence screamed control and power.  An essence that nothing could shake her, like she had seen more and understood more than anyone else around her.  Her eyes however betrayed her.  Slightly glassy and rimmed with a red hue that no amount of makeup could cover, she showed a distinct weariness. I couldn’t tell for sure but it looked like she had either just finished crying or was just about to start. 
	“Excuse me
	“You’re not.”  She never even looked at me while she spoke; she merely continued serving up shot for the other patrons at the counter.  Some of which looked just as lost and confused as I felt on the inside. I’d be damned if I were gonna let it show though. 
“I’m not……what?” 
She made her way back towards me
	“You’re not anywhere in hell.  Not yet at least, you are right where you’re supposed to be.  You died and now you await your judgment.”   She grabbed a shot glass from under that bar, mixed together any number of different spirits so fast that I couldn’t even begin to guess what was in it and set it in front of me.   The result was a hard red drink with a single gold drop floating through the middle.   It was the exact same drink she had served everyone else.  Apparently it was the special of the day.   
	“Not much of a selection around here is there?  How bout you swap mine out for a beer instead.”  I was a sucker for girls but my momma had always raised me on the whole don’t eat or drink things that a stranger puts in front of you philosophy.   
	“This isn’t your place to make choices mijo.  You’ve already made your choices.   The drink just weighs them out and delivers you to your new home.  This isn’t your world anymore.”  She spun my glass around to face me.  I hadn’t seen the print before she poured the drink but now it stared me right in the face.

	“No you're not.” says Sheri. “It's your fourteenth  birthday. Remember? Now get out of bed and get dressed.”
	
	Let me tell you a little bit about Airon. His hair is dark brown and curly but he keeps it short, Hawk, because he has hawk like vision.

	   Airon had just finished getting dressed and walked to the dining room sit down and eat breakfast.
	“Good morning mother. Good morning father.” said Airon.
	“Good morning” said Sheri and his dad
	“Here are you presents.” said Sheri. “Sorry we didn't wrap them”
	Airon took the present to inspect them
	“Armor
	“We figured you might need these” said Cordo “ Oh
	 “Um what type of sword is this?” asked Airon
	“Obsidian iron. It's unbreakable you know.” said Cordo. “and the armor is dragon scale but it can change in to lite dragon bone armor
	“Great.” Said Airon
	“Not if you turn the armor into a cloak and put your sword under it.” Said Sheri.
	Airon sighs “I need to go for a walk.” Says he and walks out the door.















						Chapter 2
	
	Airon wandered around the town for a while bought some dried fruit, and fire making equipment.  As he was walking he decided to go to his girlfriend's house.  When Airon arrived he knocked on the door, no answer, he knock louder, still no answer.  He backed away from the door and charged, suddenly the door flew open in front of him WHACK everything went dark.
	When Airon woke up his head was throbbing with pain. 
	“I'm so so sorry!” said Airon's girlfriend
	“I..it's ok. I'm...fine...don’t worry. Why did you hit me any way?” 
	“I thought you a soldier.” said Abigail.
	“ Why? 
	“ because it's collection week.”
	“I totally forgot.”
 	“How do you forget?”
	“I think you knocked it out as me....... hahahaha”
Airon pulled out a scroll
	“What is that? And why do you have a backpack?” asked Abigail.
	“It's a healing spell. As for your second question I'm skipping town. Are you willing to come?”
	“Ok. I was going to leave any way.” 
	“When were you going to tell me?”
	“Just now”
	“What was that?” asked Airon
	
	There was clanking of weapons and armor “lets check this house.” said a man.
	“We need to hide!” said Airon.

	They ran to the fireplace and climbed as fast as they could. The door fell from a kick and the soldiers searched the room. 
	“check the fire place.” said someone.
 	
	A man looked up the chimney. No one was there.

	As soon as Airon and Abigail jumped off the roof they started running
	“Wher ya you two youngsters a goin?” asked the stall keeper
	“To Misty Spark Falls.” said Airon.
	“aright” said Dirk.
	
	They walked  to the edge of town and took a right on a fork in the road when Abigail said	“I thought we were going to the falls.”  
	“we're not I told him that so if anyone asked he would say that.” said Airon.
	“Oh. I didn't think of that”
	“I could tell...I could tell.” laughed Airon.

	Let me interrupt the story real quick I just want to tell you what Abigail looks like. She is blonde with startling ocean blue eyes and her build is sleek
	A few minutes after they left the town the group of guards that were looking for them asked Dirk where they went and he said they went to the falls.
	“Sure they did.” said a guard. As they walked away
	“What should we do Captain?” asked Roldfier
	“Go to the fields.” said Captain Valneir. “ Everybody move out.”
	“How do you know captain?” asked a guard.
Valneir drew his sword as he spun around and loped the guards head off

""Are you awake? How can you drive such a piece of shit.? Jacob are you up?"" asked the young woman.
""I am now thanks."" Replied Jacob as he rubbed his eyes. He looks outside at the passing scenery.
""How can you sleep?""
""I close my eyes.""
""Real funny Jake.""
""This isn't the first time I've done this you know.""
""I know
""Nope clean conscience. Where are we anyways?""
""How can you have a clean conscience when you're lying to people?""
""I'm not lying to people. Where are we?"" responds Jacob as he takes out a glasses case from a jacket pocket. He opens it and looks at the dark rimmed sunglasses inside the case.
""Well if it's not lying then what is it? Just taking advantage of people by pretending to be something your not? You walk around with your can and take advantage of people's generosity.""
Jacob takes the sunglasses out of the case then puts them on.
""Lying implies that I am stating something that is not true. I never walk around and tell people that I'm a blind man. They just assume it.""
""You know what I mean. It's being dishonest.""
""I can live with that. You still haven't told me where we are.""
""You can live with it but still. It doesn't seem right. Doesn't seem ethical in any way. Don't you have a job? I can think of better ways of making money.""
""Yeah that's great. How far are we from the city anyways?""
""You're not even listening. Why don't you go pretend to be deaf too?""
""I wish I was deaf right now.""
""Real fucking hilarious Jacob. Why did I even agree to drive your sorry ass.""
""Jesus are you on your period or something.""
""Fucking shit Jacob
""Christ I'm sorry. And I had a job but I got fired.
""Thank you."" The young woman sighed. ""So why did they fire you?"" asked the young woman.
""I dunno. I guess they thought they could do better. I don't blame them. Anyways where are we? You still haven't answered.""
""Why can't you hold on to a job? And we're a couple minutes from the bride into the city. Hard to tell. Are you doing this because you need income or something? There's nothing wrong with welfare you know. I can ask my dad to lend you some cash. I'm sure he wouldn't mind since he's known you forever.""
""I'm not taking any money from your family.""
""Why not? You seem to have no problem taking money from strangers. You walk around pretending to be blind and take just let people give you money. I want to know why you're doing this.""
""I won't take money from you guys because you've helped me out enough.""
""Then what is it Jacob? You know I care. Just tell me.""
""What does it matter why I do things? Just drop it already. Please. Look we're here at the bridge just let me off here"" The car slows to a stop. Fog covers the bridge at the halfway point. The other side remains hidden.
""It matters because I want to know why I'm driving you to another city so you can take advantage of people.""
A silence enters the car. It seeps in from the windows and from the dashboard. It fills the car with a hesitation that doesn't speak. Jacob looks outside.
""No one ever gives two shits about me. People hardly give two shits about themselves.""
""So what you just do it so people care about you?""
""No
""What's nice?"" said the young woman
""Seeing people being nice to each other. People feel better about themselves when they help others. ""
""So you just want to be treated nicely for once. Listen if this is about the psychologists you should know that I'm here to listen if you-""
""Goodbye Lucy"" said Jacob. ""No need to be a saint for me."" He leaves the car wearing the dark rimmed sunglasses and holding a tin can.

“What? It’s not that bad.” Olivia continued belting out lyrics. “Well, baby).”
	
“Twist and shout... (twist and shout)
	
Olivia looked down at her phone and brought up the map. The blue line traced the path to their weekend. “Without traffic I’d say less than an hour till we hit the first Key.”
	
“Yessssss!”  Gwen, “Freedom!” 
	
“I know. We’ve put this off for too long.” Oliva
shook out her hair. It was a poor attempt to stop it from smacking her in the face. “Gwen
	
“No we don’t. I filled up ten minutes ago.”  She looked at the gauge just to be sure. It was early
	
“Uh
	
“Oh

What could be wrong with a little flirting? Both girls were single and on vacation. The sun started to rise giving them a welcoming warmth that the early morning was missing. The girls traded their sweaters for sunglasses and finally found hair ties at the bottom of their beach bag. Gwen took the final sip of her coffee and was glad to have a reason to go inside and spark up a conversation. 

The coffee smelled fresh which was rare for a turnpike rest stop. Olivia raided the chips trying her best not to stare at the two men browsing the candy bars. Gwen couldn’t believe how her best friend could go from a shy

“Shit.” Gwen let the coffee overflow burning her hand. She stuck the burnt part into her mouth and went looking for ice.

“Don’t put ice on it.” The warning came from a deep voice behind her.

Gwen froze thinking her mishap had gone unnoticed. The last thing she wanted was for a cute guy to see her sucking on her hand after burning herself.
 
“It’ll blister quicker. Try warm water or soy sauce.” 

She released her hand and winced. “I’ll be sure to keep that in mind next time I try to cook.”

“Or pour coffee?” He smirked. 

*Aren't we a smart ass.* She forgave him. He was being helpful and those greens eyes made it easy to forget the burn. 

He looked around the convenience store before asking. “You two making this trip by yourselves?”
	
“Yeah. We’re big girls. I think we can handle it.” Gwen couldn’t help but grin. He was gorgeous. “Why do you think otherwise
	
“Officer.” His cocky but he was good at it. “Of course I do. There are pirates in these parts. Why else do you think they are calling the Navy down here.”
	
Gwen laughed at him. “Well if my ship gets boarded and plundered
	
“I’m sure you’d be what they’re plundering.” He couldn’t keep a straight face. “We’re all on leave if you ladies are making it all the way down to the tip. We’d sure love for you to join us.”
	
“That could be fun.” Gwen stuck out her hand. “I’m Gwen.”
	
He looked at her hand and saw it was still red. He gently took it in his and kissed it. “I’m Lance.”
	
“Oh
	
Olivia watched the two exchange numbers. Gwen had to drag Olivia from the convenience store. When they got in the car Gwen handed Olivia a ten. Olivia was able to keep silent until they hit 80. 
	
She finally blurted out
	
“You might want to close your mouth
	
“No really? Did a guy name Lance really just kiss a girl named Gwen on her hand?” For the twenty years they had known each other
	
“You’re crazy. And no matter what story you read she never marries Lancelot.” She saw Olivia’s smile fade. “Don’t I have to find Arthur first anyways?”
	
“No
	
Olivia slept the rest of the way to Key West and missed out on the few times Gwen pulled over to take pictures of houses on stilts. The seven mile bridge gave way to open skies and blue waters that made Gwen want to pull over and jump into the ocean. There would be time for that during the week. 

Gwen tried to wake Olivia when they went through Sugarloaf key but the girl continued sleeping. Even sleeping through her own photo shoot with a Key deer. One came right up to the parked Jeep and sniffed Olivia’s dangling hand. 

	The Jeep chugged down the road past places that could have been anywhere but the keys. Those fancy postcards only told part of the story. It was refreshing to see normality in a vacation spot. They passed through where the townies lived and into post card Key West. Bright colors blinded Olivia as she opened her eyes.	
	
“We’re here?” She sounded a bit surprised. 

“Of course we are. What did you think I was doing while you were playing sleeping beauty?”  As Gwen pulled into the driveway of the bed and breakfast her phone buzzed.
	
“Ah! Let me read.” Olivia sntached it up before Gwen  could react. “Hi
	
“So I’m guessing he has a friend or two for you
	
Olivia rolled her eyes. She started shoving all her stuff she thrown around the jeep into her overnight bag. “Yeah
	
Two full size beds with white and baby blue quilts and matching towel animals awaited them behind the door. Gwen claimed the bed closest to the sliding glass door. “Olivia you have to see this.”
 
Both girls gaped at the view. Their room was only a few drunken skips away from the ocean. The sand and blue water was just what they were needing to recharge with. 

Gwen was delighted with her last minute hotel choice. “How cute is this?”

“Are you sure the animals aren’t going to miss you while you're gone?” Olivia was already out of her sweatpants and shirt and into a bikini with a bright pink cover up. 

“There are other caretakers for the otters.” Gwen hadn’t even thought about changing. She was perfectly content with stepping out on the balcony and taking a nice nap on the hammock. “Pretty sure I’ll miss them more.”

“Not if you‘re distracted.” Olivia waved Gwen’s phone in front of her.

“How did you? Seriously are you a magician?” Gwen was certain she had her cell in her back pocket.

“You dropped it when you put your bag down. And since when have you cared about me touching your phone? What are you hiding?” She lifted her right brow half expecting Gwen to dive for the phone. But there was nothing more than a shrug from her.

“If you want to ruin your surprise go right away. But don’t come crying to me saying how you couldn’t wait.” It was easy to bait Olivia. The two had known each other for twenty-three out of their twenty-seven years of life. “Go ahead. Look if you must.”

Olivia stood with her mouth open looking at the phone not knowing what to do. She blinked a few times waiting for see if Gwen was lying. But there was nothing. Moving faster than she expected herself to she snatched a business card off the desk and ran into the bathroom with the card and phone. Gwen rushed over and pounded on the door but there was nothing she could do about it now. 

When Olivia finally returned from the bathroom she had a huge smirk on her face. Gwen knew that look all too well. “What did you do?”

From my high perch in the old oak tree, a thin layer of fog lingers on it's nearly placid surface. A light breeze moves through the trees and I detect the ripple of leaves as it moves across the face of the forest. 

Near the base of the oak I spy two squirrels as they chase each other around and around the trunk of the tree. They eventually work their way upwards as the game continues. Finally the leader runs along a branch and in a great leap that seems almost preternatural

The squirrel that had been following is now left behind. It starts chattering in that nervous way that squirrels do. The creature almost seems unhappy the chase has ended. 

I briefly ponder the meaning. Were they friends playing a game? Was it a territorial conflict? I shall never know the reason.

Basic summary, near poverty life dies. He then finds himself in the hands of the Angel of Death, who tells him that he has been sentenced to Hell, but it was a mistake. They then seek God, who tells them that there is going to be another rebellion in Heaven. Eran must go through Hell, Purgatory and then Heaven to find out who is behind this rebellion, and along the way, here's a piece from the second chapter. (Forgive the length of this post.)

-The crushing darkness. The endless abyss. I stood there, this place. Maybe I got about 2 minutes of wandering and thinking, then bright. A bright light appeared in front of me. At least it was bright to me, who had not been able to see anything in this darkness. Before me what looked like a portal appeared. A figure appeared to me, and reached out to me. And it called to me. No, not physically, though. I felt it call me, I felt a force pulling me slightly. I reached into the portal, and held so tight. They reeked of decay and death. It pulled me in and I went through. I landed on the floor, or anywhere. Only one streetlight was on. The one I was positioned on. Then as I got up and continued to look

“Eran...” The voice sounded old, the voice spoke to me. “Far enough.” I stopped and stood. I then wanted to know what was going on. So I decided to speak.


“How do you know my name? What is this place?” I began to adjust to the darkness around me, not too big and beefy. He appeared to be wearing a cloak and holding a large staff. Then he began to enter the light. Slowly but surely I saw the parts that entered. His hands, both made of bone. Then his arms, covered in black sleeves. As the rest of him appeared, I noticed his dark robe covered in bones, but they were formed into some kind of armor. And then his staff, a long bone staff. It was made of a long spinal cord and then I look as light reflected off the top. This was no staff, a hood shrouding a face in darkness. The complete picture


“Tsk, there would be no escape.” I turned to face him once again. I was terrified. I should've expected him, but I just thought that the Grim Reaper was just a myth. “Yes, Eran. I exist. Don't be surprised.” Whoa, that was weird. It was almost as if he were... He spoke again. “I know what you're thinking Eran, because after all the souls that have thought the same, I've grown accustomed to people debating on my existence. I am the Angel of Death. And I've come to take you to your eternal resting place.” I stood surprised, appeared a doorway. An entrance, ye who enter here.” I stood confused and then I realized something. I recognized that sign. I remember those words. Yes


It was 10th grade English class. I remember that class so well. The teacher, like 30 or so. Everyone liked the teacher, so everyone would sign up for her class. I signed up because a few of my friends were in it. Yeah, we had good times in that class, too. I remember when we were free writing, me and my friends would always finish our assignments first, and the teacher would let us leave class to chill. Those were the days we would leave school to go get something to eat. We would go to a Burger King, Charlie would always get a double cheeseburger. Then we'd get back to school on time for lunch and we'd just hang and not have to worry about waiting in line for lunch
	    

But, I remember. The first part, Inferno. Where Dante travels through Hell. Then it hit me. It hit me harder than if two trains were to crash into each other with me in between. In Dante's Inferno, the entrance to Hell had a sign that said the same things as this one. My eyes widened and I shouted:
	    

“NO! No
	    

“Unfortunately Eran
	    

“There must be a mistake! I have done nothing wrong in my life! Nothing that would put me here! Give me a chance to make it up!” I pleaded more than ever. I knew I had done nothing wrong. I have done nothing wrong. I have not committed any major sin.
	    

“It's out of my control
	    

“Who's decision is it then? Allow me to speak to whoever it is!” Death stood. He lifted his hand and pointed up. I felt confused but I knew who what he was gesturing. Rather
	    

“It is God. He decides. No mortal soul may see him, crying wouldn't help at all. 
	    

“Then what? I will forever be cursed to Hell unjustly? God knows all, and he should know about me. He does know about me. “Just give me a chance.” He then looked at the entrance and to me again.
	    

“I may not speak against God's will. But I may give you a chance. I will accompany you through Limbo, there is a possibility that you may escape that ill fate in the Inferno.” I felt relieved.

Regulations on personal firearms were practically thrown out the window as soon one descended the towers to the lower districts, where the club was located. Men of all species took the law into their own hands down here, and like an old wild west movie, shootouts were more common than handshakes. What caught Bos’ eye was the obsidian-black of the gun’s long, smooth barrel which contrasted greatly with the pearly white of it’s handle, an ornately carved material- probably bone or some type of soft stone- with a design he couldn’t quite make out. He set down his glass and walked over to the man

“What’ll you have?” Bos barked in his native tongue, a scent he couldn’t quite describe.

“Information.” The stranger barked back fluently, there was a heavy, synthetic quality in the voice, like an android or computerized voice. The foreigner lifted his head and stared straight into Bos’ eyes. Bos finally got a good look at his face- rather, whatever there was left to see after he noticed the electronic-looking fabric wrapped around his neck and lower face, which blipped and blinked with a mind of its own. Bos had seen devices like this before, often used to mask someone’s voice, however, cascading down the right side of his long

“Sorry pal, some telling him about secret treasures hidden to all but them, their bottle, and now the bartender. Some drank away murders, solemnly burying their emptiness with alcohol and women and rambling in slurred speeches about how nothing in the universe mattered but money. Still others couldn’t keep quiet about skeletons in their closet; Company secrets they were ashamed to be burdened with, or mobsters whose coffers they had just lightened. Bos-Bos stood idly by as those loose-lipped patrons learned their lesson the hard way; usually with a white hot pulse of lethal blaster fire.

“Wait.” The mechanized voice spoke, the exchange rates in these parts for that particular denomination were astronomical. That handful could easily buy a ship or have a problem… Taken care of.

Bos walked back to the newcomer and leaned on the bar

“No.” Was the man’s response. Bos-Bos didn’t expect a straight answer, slobbering aliens stood guard on either side of the door. The stranger tipped his hat and stood up, sifting his way through the crowd. Bos-Bos turned his attention to other patrons waving money in his face in exchange for tools of inebriation. Over the music his keen ears heard three blaster shots; the smell of blood and singed meat trailed to his nose.

The remnants of the afternoon rain drummed gently on the hood of Curtis’s Impala. It had been a typical summer thunderstorm in New Orleans, the sky itself seemed to open up as an ocean of cleansing rain poured down. The thunderstorm bathed the city and dispelled, if only for an hour, the oppressive June humidity. Tennessee Williams had called it a slice of eternity, but it made the shrapnel in Curtis’s hip- a nineteenth birthday present from the Japanese- ache. It hurt more than it used to. At 39 years of age, Curtis was getting a little old for the private detective game, but it was all he knew how to do and he wasn’t about to learn any new tricks. Curtis browsed the headlines of the States-Item sitting on the passenger side of the car’s bench seat- a monk in Indochina had lit himself on fire (which seemed a damn stupid thing to do), and there was a new Elizabeth Taylor picture out- Cleopatra. Wednesday
	The detective agency Curtis worked for had been hired by the FBI to keep tabs on suspected communist activity in New Orleans. Because of the city’s relative proximity to Cuba and strong financial ties to the Batista government, Curtis had been tailing a small, nervous man as he went to and fro around the city. This afternoon, Curtis waited for two hours during the rain outside a movie theatre on Prytania while his mark took in the afternoon matinee. 
He slid the Impala into gear as the wiry man with brown hair and nervous eyes hailed a cab and climbed into the back. Curtis had a fair idea where they were heading. This guy’s routine rarely changed. He’d leave his house off Magazine every morning, the man spent most of his time distributing pro-Castro flyers to disinterested pedestrians in front of the World Trade Mart on Camp. Curtis had watched as he got into shouting matches with passerby and shoved leaflets into the hands of women as they strolled by the river. He was a ridiculous character, but Curtis had to give the guy credit for being out there every day in the hot sun. After a day of passing out “literature”, he would take the bus home. Sometimes he went across the river to shoot with some friends, but mostly kept to himself. This guy was definitely a screwball and a hard-core commie. According to the file given to him by the FBI, this guy spoke Russian, had married a Russian even tried to live in the Soviet Union a few years back. For his part
The cab pulled up to a run-down shotgun, thin package from the porch, looked around, and went inside. Curtis pulled up half a block away and parked. In four hours, the night shift would come on. Curtis cracked the window to let in the heavy early evening air. It had been a long day, and his seersucker suit was plastered to his body with sweat. The barrel of his .38 jammed into the soft flesh under his arm. Curtis had been a fullback at Warren Easton before he had been drafted into the Navy, big and powerful, but over the years the muscle had slowly turned to fat and arthritis settled in to his hips. Curtis took off his hat, and then another
He was nineteen years old again. Smoke choked his eyes. His ears rang as the 5” guns fired again. Curtis’s muscles strained to lift another heavy shell into the gunhouse as the breech ejected the old casing. They had spotted the Jap destroyers an hour ago and had been firing ever since. Curtis was sure they had been hit, the USS Chevalier, in the bow, tearing off the forward third of the destroyer, along with sixty souls. When Curtis came to, he was covered in blood and had a searing, white-hot pain in his hip. The ship’s emergency lighting cast the compartment in a deep crimson. He could tell that the other five men in the gunhouse were dead.  He managed to pull himself out of the turret and collapsed onto the burning deck of the dying ship. Someone handed him a life preserver and Curtis slid into the Pacific as his ship capsized
Curtis awoke to Luke tapping on the glass of the Impala. Luke was the night shift and would keep an eye on the commie’s house until the next morning. It wasn’t the first time that Luke had found him drunk. Curtis started the Impala and slowly pulled out into the street. By muscle memory, unlocked the door, and put his revolver on the table. He opened the cylinder, looking glassy-eyed at the five dull brass .38 Special casings. He tapped the ejector, scooping out four. He closed his eyes and spun the cylinder shut, feeling the cold barrel on the stubble under his chin. He pulled the hammer back and the metallic click filled the apartment. A long moment passed, but Curtis knew he would never pull the trigger. He was too scared. He got undressed and fell asleep on the sofa listening to records.
He awoke the next morning and shaved. A cup of black coffee helped with the headache. He dressed, standing out on the corner of the street bothering regular, hard-working Americans with his commie bullshit. According to his file, this guy was a loser, having held a series of odd jobs after busting out of the Marines. He had even tried to sell the know-how he picked up in the service to the Russians. Not even the Russians wanted him, sending him back to the U.S. after a year. This guy was a total failure, a joke. At yet here Curtis was
Curtis unsnapped the leather holster of his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and reached for the door handle of the Impala. He was going to end this once and for all. He could see the little man about fifty yards away. Curtis would walk up to him, Curtis took his flask out of his coat pocket and helped himself to another shot. Then, he opened the door, stepped out, and began to make his way to the Trade Mart. Just then, an NOPD black and white pulled up to the stoplight at the corner of Camp and Common. Curtis froze in a moment of indecision. 
Curtis stood there for what seemed like an eternity until something grabbed his attention. He looked over at the corner where the nervous little man had been handing out his pro-Castro flyers. He had entered into a shouting match with a Cuban man who was now pushing him against a wall, the two cops at the stoplight got out and broke up the fight, dragging the little man into the back of their squad car. As the officers drove off, the Cuban picked himself up and wiped the blood from his nose, walking towards the drugstore a few blocks up. Curtis turned slowly and walked back to his Impala, sinking into the driver’s seat. He would file his report for the FBI that afternoon. He was now convinced that this guy was a complete crackpot: Lee Harvey Oswald was a nobody, and his Castro flyers were a joke. Curtis started the Chevy and drove to the bar.

“The events in concern occurred on the 13th of September 1993. I had recently been transferred to the children’s ward of St. Isaac’s Hospital in Blackgate, for nothing tears the soul more than the screams of sick and dying men and women other than the shrill, piercing cries of tormented children. And despite not suffering from their ailments, tending to the ill has taken its toll on me.
Since the beginning of my residency I’ve been strung as taut as a bow, there are breaks, but if you ask me, it feels as if it has been a single perpetual migraine, from start to unforeseeable end. Even now the left side of my head is pounding, and vision in my right eye is becoming blurry, my eyelid twitching. But I digress...

On the morning of the 13th of September, but peaceful, still death. More often than not it was expected, and when it wasn’t there was a routine. But this... I was never prepared to see the corpse of a sickly young girl with leukaemia, face down on the floor, splatters of regurgitated blood on her sheets. I wasn’t prepared. I collapsed to my knees beside her and began to cry. Rivulets of silent tears trickled down my cheeks, and dripped off my chin and into my lap. I turned her over and saw her brilliant golden pendant gleaming magnificently against bleak blue-grey skin. The stark image struck me, a bellowing howl of sorrow.

My lament drew the attention of the rest of the staff, he had successfully completed almost every surgery he performed. He became the surgeon people asked for, and his skill soon propelled him to the position of head. At one point, it seemed his medical prowess transcended simply surgical contexts, and most any patient treated by him, no matter how violently they swayed on the brink of Limbo, was saved. Dr. Amos, fought his fame and chose to remain the most respected (and highly paid) man in Blackgate.
In recent times, one could see the gnarls of old age beginning to form, but even those were looking better these days.
Dr. Amos suggested I take a break, and sat down in an effort to gather my thoughts. It was only 10am and I’d already broken down. It was going to be a long day. Suddenly, a crippling pain burst from the left side of my head. Had the migraine just now reared its head, or had it been there the whole time, I didn’t know. What I did know was that the aversion to light and sound that so often gripped sufferers of migraines had me in its grasp.

Every noise became too loud, a high-pitched whine began to fill my ears, the source of which I could not quite pinpoint. I left my tea and fled the noise, leaving the lounge and turning into a storage closet on my left.
I was greeted by a dark, beyond anything I had smelled in my life, something beyond human existence. Never had such a malodour befouled my nostrils. Despite the almost definitely loathsome source of the putrid aroma, curiousity got the better of me. I turned on the (thankfully) dim light, and searched for the locus of putridity, and found it almost instantly. A viscous, membranous phlegmatic mass of ooze had engulfed the light bulb and clung to the ceiling above it. The yellowish mucus was the source of the stink, the more light headed I felt myself becoming. Every mouthful of the wretched odour I inhaled left me feeling emptier than the last and before long

I awoke sometime later not in the storage closet, whether in or out of the hospital.
On the table in the middle of the room lay a child’s corpse, for even now I grow nauseous discussing the topic. I averted my gaze to the floor, and saw upon it a small, gore-coated gleaming object. I picked it up and turned it over in my hand. It was Amanda’s necklace.
I ran from that wretched altar. Breathing heavily

I returned to the hospital that night to investigate. My nights were mostly sleepless anyway. All doctors were given night access cards, and trailed off into the darkness, an odd, perverted yellow brick road which wouldn’t lead me to the Wizard, but rather to something beyond my wildest dreams. My dreams aren’t pleasant.
I followed the trail of membranous phlegm until it stopped abruptly outside the office of head doctor Amos. Upon closer inspection I saw the trail didn’t end abruptly, as if the owner was breathing in to speak, and pronouncing sounds not with a tongue, but a throat. The moment I heard that hoarse, guttural abomination of speech a jolt of pain from my migraine caused me to recoil. Then I heard a second voice, the terrified voice of Dr. Arcurio Amos. I only caught snippets of the conversation, for it was difficult to understand the conversation.

“My d-dark shaman
“Excellent
At that point an otherworldly roar erupted from Dr. Amos’s office

“What was that?!” snapped the voice.
“I shall s-see
I could hear Amos’s long strides coming towards the door. I could feel my heart attempting to leap out of my throat
“YOU!” 
I was agape with fear. Amos looked younger. All traces of grey were gone from his hair, it turned to face me and I could not only smell the odour it was emitting, but feel it in my core. I could feel the scent of horror. The parts of the body I could see under the mass of leathery wings were covered in pulsating, pimple-like pustules.
The satanic seraph roared what I assume was a guttural order at Amos

Dr. Amos
“Now, the Cosmic god of Death and Exploitation. I sacrifice younger patients to him so he may build his strength through the absorption of their ‘root fluids’, and in return he provides me with the leftovers of his Holy meal. And doesn’t it do wonders? They’ll heal almost anything, even time’s wounds... (chuckle) who knew the fountain of youth was the blood of the young?. Too bad they’ll never reach the modern medical world. Issues with ethics and contracts with Cosmic gods you see. Well, goodbye”

Above him, quite naked and quite alone, save the presence of a small stream beside him, but it ran on urgently, completely indifferent to his presence.

*Hmm*

Strange as it was for him to be lying naked in the middle of a clearing with no recollection as to how he wound up there

After what could have been hours or minutes

She was sitting cross-legged a few feet from him, translucent material hung from her torso and gathered in bunches on the ground around her. Her hair was like light solidified – it moved fluidly and shimmered beautifully; he couldn't quite bear to look at it. Her skin was fair, but when the light brushed it, she seemed to give off a golden glow. Her eyes were green with flecks of gold in them one moment and a cool grey the next. The puzzled expression on her face made her all the more beautiful. Suddenly, the presence of this ethereal creature watching him quizzically made him very aware of the fact that he was naked. He wasn't surprised to find that he didn't care about that either.

""Hello

""Oh – hello!"" she replied, it's just…well, no one hardly notices I'm here until I address them.""

""Well

""After I've decided whether or not they deserve an explanation."" she replied simply.

They lapsed into silence for quite some time –or possibly very little time

""So

His eyes sprang open. She was watching him again. This woman was starting to annoy him. He began to answer her question.

""My name is –

*Weird*

""I can't remember my name."" he finished simply and closed his eyes again.

""Really?"" she asked inquisitorially

He opened his eyes

""Who are *you*?"" he asked her.

""Oh

""Well

""I didn't mean it as a compliment

""Well

""I guess I can't really control what you think, beaming again. ""You really are different. Tell me, where do you think you are?""

""Oh

""Ah. That is true, ""but why?""

""Why…are you asking me?""

""Well

""…Not that I'm aware of

""Well, the dress fell around her in such a way that he found himself beginning to care that he was naked.

""Where will we go?"" he asked her

""Who knows?"" she replied, he hesitantly rose from his spot and caught up with her.

""So

She was silent. She seemed thoughtful. She glanced at him

Eventually

""I think…I'd like to get in."" he said.

In response, disappearing under the surface for a moment. By the time she reemerged, he had already followed suit and swam out to meet her. She smiled and dove down again, breaking the calm of the water's surface.

The water was warm

They swam in silence for some time more and then just as suddenly as she'd gotten in the water

And suddenly

He swam back up to shore

She looked over at him.

""Do you find me beautiful?"" she asked him softly.

He hadn't thought about it

Suddenly

He responded immediately, exploring his skin, setting him on fire. A few moments ago, she was just a woman who happened to be in his company. Now, he wanted her so badly, it was driving him mad.

She pushed gently on his chest. He took the cue and rolled back over. She climbed on top of him and proceeded to kiss him roughly once more.

She was so warm. He was so overcome with desire for her.

That did it.

He pushed her back down and thrust himself into her.

Back and forth they went

Eventually, contented. She moved over to lie on his chest.

""I'm almost sorry

Maybe he was dreaming? That would explain a lot.

""What do you mean?"" he asked her softly.

""Well

""I…am still confused.""

""I don't understand why you did it…"" she continued.

Her expression was unreadable.

""Did what? Can you please start making some semblance of sense?""

""Killed yourself – I don't understand why you did it.""

He stopped for a moment before he answered. ""Ah, though.""

""That's what I hate. They usually do."" She sighed.

""My point is

""Yes."" She pushed herself up to look him in the eyes.

""Well

She laughed delightedly

""Why do they always ask if this is heaven? No. This isn't heaven. There is no heaven. This is just…well

He nodded. She was right.

""So

""Oh

""But

""If I had to?"" she asked

""Yes. Please?""

""The gun is still warm. If we were to base it off your perception of time

""Even though I feel as if I've been here for an eternity?""

""Exactly

""Well

""Like I said

""Oh

""Well

""Wait – this isn't already 'on'?""

""I'm afraid not."" She smiled sadly.

The man sat quietly in the vehicle with music playing from it. He gently tapped his fingers on his legs as he listened. Emilia suddenly felt the air grow cold; she didn't want him to see her. Carefully Emilia hid behind an old food seller’s stall. There was still food rotting in their containers

By now Emilia was almost feeling light headed.  A loud creak interrupted the silence of the bare streets and she turned to see Mr. Hawkes closing the door to the district. It was now that Emilia saw the piercings in the metal door. It looked like a mob of tiny hornets had tried to sting through the door. She recognized now that the street was soaked in old blood

""I want to see Chelsea Zebra."" Mr. Hawkes said clearly

As the small man lead Mr. Hawkes into a white washed building, and the inside was really nothing but rubble. The entire ceiling had collapsed. A woman sat a good ways inside, wearing a uniform that Emilia did not recognize. Mr. Hawkes greeted her and the woman kissed him on both cheeks. Her smile was genuine but her eyes reflected something that the girl could not describe. The two of them sat down on some make shift chairs made out of rubble, the woman making sure to sit very close to Mr. Hawkes.

""Like my latest achievement
""It was unnecessary to do any of this,"" How many did you kill?""

""It doesn't matter, ""I can see it now, a wonderful park over there by the entrance with towering trees, and I already figured that this building would be rebuilt to be our house.""
Mr. Hawkes slowly shook his head.

""I made this place for you, so that you can be close to the filth that you love so much.""

The small man that had accompanied Mr. Hawkes into the building shied away from Chelsea a bit. He seemed to be used to her angry fits. 

""I am not in line to be married right now

He stood up from the rubble and began to walk away.

""Our families are meant to be united; do you know what will happen to us if I cannot be married up?"" Chelsea screamed after him

Mr. Hawkes quickly wandered for the exit of the building. As if knowing that Emilia would be there, Mr. Hawkes shoved her through the exit and followed. For one split second his face relaxed when he looked at her, he smiled his usual confident smile. 

""I can't have you staying down here with people like her, ""And at eighteen you can decide for yourself what you want, I won't influence your choices what so ever.""

Mr. Hawkes turned to the old vendor by the door and purchased a small carton of artificial milk. His hand was trembling slightly but to Emilia, a look of pure disdain.

Emilia wondered if all was lost for her now. Her mind was filled with an intolerable fear that she could not understand. She fell to her knees at Mr. Hawkes side and she struggled to drag him out of the bloody district. Emilia's frail arms tense and her muscles worked but the weight of this man was immovable for a malnourished girl. She screamed as another explosion erupted, wondering on how to get him out of her. It didn't matter if he was dead or alive; she couldn't leave him in that place. 

The head was dissipating from Mr. Hawkes body. Emilia knew what this meant. She had held a stray animal once that had been starving. It died in her arms and the feeling of life draining from its body was something she would never forget. Emilia screamed again, regardless of how he looked. He managed to close district door with one swift movement. Emilia realized that she was still screaming, her face was hot and she could still hear the explosions on the other side of the door. The sound was haunting her, why would they keep shooting? 

The goblin man rested his head on Mr. Hawkes chest, the disappearance of her mother, even the loss of the stray animal. This was far too much. Emilia rested her head on his chest and closed her eyes, struggling to hear something, anything. She heard sirens; the Order Committee's medical team arrived.

And you realize something about the whole experience.  You realize the worst part about all of this won’t be when the dam gives way.  Not when the waters rise and wipe out roads.  Not when people flee their hopes with photo albums held tightly.  The worst part was when you first noticed those small

You think that up until the very moment the dam bursts and icy water hits you like a freight train.  And in that moment you realize you were wrong.  You yearn for the leaky helpless feeling because it meant you weren’t drowning.  At least the dam was intact then.  You long for those times you lied to yourself about not seeing the initial drops.

I was in Paris not terribly long ago and had occasion to visit the Centre Pompidou. The modern art housed there was fantastic, not the sound of passing cars.  I was in that hot, felt room and I began to sweat and my brain kicked in with a substitute sound for that God-forsaken felt silence.  That familiar high-pitched frequency was back.  It consumed me.  I couldn’t breath.  I was in a vacuum with a piano and no oxygen.  I reached my right hand to the window switch and once the vacuum seal was broken on the felt car and the window lowered all my senses immediately returned.  I was shocked back into existence and the high-pitched frequency was now gone; replaced by passing cars, the hum of the engine.  I stuck my head out the window like a medium-to-small-sized dog and for a moment I forgot that this car ended at the glue factory and I was Boxer.  I tried to spend the remaining 90 seconds not thinking about my impending fate, but that was, of course, impossible.

You think that up until the very moment the dam bursts and icy water hits you like a freight train.  And in that moment you realize you were wrong.  You yearn for the leaky helpless feeling because it meant you weren’t drowning.  At least the dam was intact then.  You long for those times you lied to yourself about not seeing the initial drops. When you lied to yourself as you were convinced you could stop Mother Nature herself with one of your fingers.  You long for that the water swallows you up.  This is the worst part. Drowning. This is the worst part.

Now where was I? Oh yes

Well Reaper, with spikes, I might add, absorbed even the strongest of blows from these creatures. Not that many got close enough to touch him, that is!”

At this, that rang through The Lantern. Alice simply looked at him, jaw-dropped in honor and a little horror. Could such a being really exist?

“Well of course he exits, reading the child's face and thoughts. “He's just as real as you or I as we sit here now.” Alice couldn't believe this. Her smile turned wider—such an image! A great beast, with glowing eyes behind its mask, crushing cars beneath its tremendous boots, simply thrashing its way through the evil of the city, not taking a scratch! Truly, this was the stuff of legends.

“But, as people say, when the streets were flooded from the blood of Hell, Reaper removed his mask.” Alice's face fell—something was wrong? What could be wrong with...with death?

“No one knows, or even what he looks like. There is one more story that floats through this town about that...man. If even a single glimpse of that monster's true face were to be seen...poof!” His hands shot out an inch, but caught the girl off guard.

At this, a strong, mighty hand lifted her gracefully up onto the counter, placing her daintily down. “Woah there, little one! Best not to be falling to the floor! Haven't cleaned it in a week. Now...about that legend....” Alice imitated the bartenders gesture and mouthed his last word, “poof,” to him. “Ah yes, let me just conclude by saying that no living soul has seen this beast without his mask. No one alive anyway. Save for one man.”

Right as the secret was to be revealed

“She's here,” the keeper replied.

“Oh thank Maria. Alice! What have I told you about running off? And without your shoes again?” Kyle strode down the staircase into the bar

“You've got yourself a sweet girl

“I know that, the pinch from Alice's little hands tightened ten-fold at this phrase, and a tear slipped down his coat. “Oh, Alice,” Kyle whispered. “I'm sorry.”

Alice sobbed into her uncle's chest, Kyle held her tightly.

“Looks like we best be going; thanks for watching her for me

“Forever and always, but I mentioned your...friend to the girl while you were away. Nothing too much, but I felt like you should know.”

Kyle's heart dropped a little at this. “Maybe next time

“Right

“Good day

“Good day, Alice lifted her head only a fraction of the way, but managed a smile which warmed the room.

As the door atop the steps closed, and made his way out. But at the top of the stairs, looking back, he could have sworn his life he saw something he shouldn't have seen—two little spheres in the darkness, each a dull yellow.

The sinister minds that surround me are cackling now, snapping at each other, laughing. They are shouting and screaming, boasting about their misdeeds.

I'd do it again if I had the chance

Yeah, another retorts. Then I’ll be impressed.

Sometimes these minds swap stories about the men who locked us in here. The ones who vacuumed us away, and ZEDDEMORE.

I remember my life. I remember the meals my parents made me eat. How big they were. On an average night, then eat two slices of cheesecake and a piece of pie before it was time for bed. And of course, if I didn’t finish it all, My Mother, The Tyrant, would beat me and make me stand in the corner. This was every night until I moved out at 19--and at 350 pounds.

Twenty-five years later

After that I was sent back, but now I was a greasy, legless, bloated monster. I had chins and folds all over my body, and I sweated a viscous, green substance that dripped off me like slime. I smelled atrocious, and when I looked down at myself I could practically see the stench boiling off of me, and I couldn’t speak--not that I had anything to say

What’s worse, it would fall through my mouth and onto the floor. If I drank a bottle of wine, it would pour onto the carpet as if nothing were in its way. And of course, despite feeling more desperate to eat than I ever felt in life, I couldn’t taste a single thing.

I had to eat, twisted to resemble my sins, and forced to live out the actions that led to my death, all the while receiving no pleasure from it. In a way it was poetic. And anyway, it’s not like I didn’t know why I was there.

The first attempt by the men to contain me had been startling. It was while I was at a food cart that had been abandoned by room service when they saw me coming. I was grabbing and pawing at the food, desperately trying to satisfy a need that couldn’t be satisfied. Then the one whose nametag read STANTZ crept up beside me. I was too focused on the food to acknowledge him, but I never suspected that he could hurt me, now that I was almost as unsubstantial as air. Then I heard a snap, followed by a slow, building whine, and a terrible burst of light lashed out at me. Terrified

It was the first pain I felt since the one in my chest

But the actual capture was even worse.

I might understand why they did it, carrying the same equipment. I froze. As I watched, he raised a walkie-talkie to his lips, and began to speak. That was when I knew for sure that they were actively seeking me out. I was never a violent person, but now I knew that these men, with their guns that fired burning orange light, had the power to hurt me. So I defended myself. I roared and flew at VENKMAN, covered in slime.

I knew it wouldn’t kill him

But less than an hour later, morphed, and shrunk as I was dragged down, into blackness.

And now here I am

They arrive angry

In here, murderers, they are thieves and arsonists and felons, gunned down by police to wind up in prison--again. Mostly I keep quiet and avoid their attention. Let them bicker and shout at each other, not at me. It’s just better that way.

Ghosts do exist. And yes

Lately there have been whispers of a soul that is stronger than all of us. And among these minds, beings like us will rule, and bring about a new age in the history of the earth. This has put difficult questions in my head.

If our evil captors are defeated by a soul more powerful than my cellmates

If our evil captors put us in here

The thought panics me

Because heart disease is hereditary.

It was after college graduation that I found her on the floor. My Mother, eyes full of pain, and said, help me, Morris. You have to call an ambulance. I'm having a heart attack!

I did call an ambulance, watched until she stopped breathing. The pain in her eyes turned to confusion, then to panic, then to anger, and then she died, cursing me, denouncing me as a mistake. I can’t really argue with her there.

It’s not like she didn’t deserve it

So as I’m stuck here, horrible spirits birthed from the husks of horrible men, I can’t help but wonder, out of school, work, family, my entire life

And why is everything vibrating?

Now our confines have begun to shake. There is a terrible noise--a long, swearing, and panic, but then, we feel ourselves lifted up, light entering above us, and we are blasted out of the machine, and a last-second consensus: The stronger one is coming.

And all I want is to go back inside.

The prompt was:

'A friend rings your doorbell way too early in the morning to be ringing doorbells. You answer the door in your PJs

  Pete was silent as he drove. This wasn’t unusual. Being mute, but not mild enough for boxers and a vest.

  That was almost an hour ago. Since then we had been on the road. Pete nervously checked his rear-view mirror every twenty seconds or so.

  ‘Pete. There’s no one behind us. We’re the only car on the road.’

  Pete looked at me briefly and seemed to relax a little.

  ‘Come on pull over. Tell me what’s going on. You’re not kidnapping me are you?’

  Pete smiled slightly and shook his head.

  ‘Good ‘cos I’m telling you no one is going to pay much for me. Come on man

  Pete glanced in the mirror one more time then pulled over. He switched the engine off and sighed.

  ‘So?’ I said. ‘Mind telling me what the hell is up?’

  He opened his door and got out

  We stood in front of the trunk and Pete gave me the ‘Ok?’ sign.

  ‘I don’t know. To be honest I’m a little nervous now. What’s in there?’ I pointed at the trunk.

  Pete sighed again and flipped the handle. The trunk swung open and what I saw left me stunned. Pete turned away and put his hands to his head in silent anguish.

  ‘Is that?’ I turned to him. ‘Pete. You didn’t. Tell me you didn’t.’            

  But Pete just looked at me with guilty eyes. He did. I turned back to the trunk and stared. Looking back at me

  ‘You’re a fucking idiot

  Pete nodded.

  The poodle belonged, along with a couple of convenience stores and a garage. Rarely a day went past that he didn’t appear in the town newspaper giving a donation or receiving a medal or some thing. He also happened to be a bona fide psychopath; rumour has it he once caught a kid throwing eggs at his car on Halloween and had two of his ‘staff’ smash the poor kid’s knees to bits. The kid said he’d been in a hit and run, of course. Rog also regular professed that he loved only one thing in this world, his pet poodle, Pecan.

  ‘Why is Pecan in the trunk of your car

  Pete explained that two nights earlier he had been in the convenience store downtown when Rog had walked in with his usual entourage. Rog had never liked Pete, don’t you think? You look like you need to cool off. He had said to Pete. He then gave the order to his cronies to put Pete in the large ice cream freezer at the back of the store. Apparently they kept him in there for twenty minutes before leaving. Humiliated, and pretty cold, Pete had taken to getting mortally drunk. On his way home from the bar he had detoured past Rog’s huge home with the intent of pissing on his car door handles but when he saw Pecan sitting all alone just on the other side of a small garden fence, his plan changed.

  ‘You ran home through main street carrying a Poodle. No one saw that? No one thought that was odd? Where do we live

  Pete shrugged then continued his story.

  The next morning he had awoken with a crippling hangover. When he remembered what he had done

  I shook my head. And what now? Were you planning on letting it go? Killing it?

  Pete glanced up.

  ‘Fuck off

  Pete shook is head violently then made the sign for stupid.

  ‘Yeah

  Pete thought for a minute then ruffled his hair.

  ‘Pete

  Pete looked skyward then marched back to the driver’s side. The sky began to brighten as we drove back into town.

  ‘We’re going to need to be quick

  We pulled in down the street from Rog’s house. Pete took Pecan out of the trunk and we walked down the street and up the drive to the front door. Pete rang the bell and looked at me.

  ‘Here we go.’

  A short, and beady far-apart eyes. He took one look at Pecan and ran back into the hallway yelling. After a few seconds Rog appeared at the door.

  ‘Pecan!’ he cried and grabbed the confused looking dog from, not you Peter, we’d be here all fucking night. You. What’s the story?’

  ‘We found it. Near my place. Was just wandering around and Pete recognised it. Said it was yours so we brought it down.’

  Rog eyed Pete suspiciously.

  ‘And where is your place?’ He said

  ‘Up the hill.’ I pointed back. Pete nodded. ‘It’s a real nice poodle

  ‘It’s not a fucking poodle you idiot. It’s a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle.’

  I didn’t know what to say. ‘Right. Well.’ That would have to do.

  ‘Schnoodle.’

  ‘Sorry?’ I said.

  ‘That’s what it’s called. It’s a schnoodle.’

  ‘Oh, we brought it back. Safe and well.’

  ‘And you two were out and about at five in the morning? Bit odd

  Shit. I thought. Should probably have planned for this.

  ‘Well we…we were actually looking for my dog. Funny that.’

  He stared at me and Pete. Pete was not helping our cause by refusing to make eye contact with Rog.

  ‘Your dog? What kind of dog is it? Maybe one of my guys has seen it.’

  ‘Oh

  ‘Dabrador huh?’

  ‘Yeah sure.’ Why not

  Rog didn’t say anything for a while.

  ‘I don’t know what you two are playing at

  Comprende? Jesus what an ass hole.

  ‘Yeah. Umm. Comprende Rog. Come on Pete.’

  We walked down to the bottom of his drive and out into the street.

  ‘Next time Pete. Just piss on his car door handles

  He smiled.

The day began like any other, then dressed for the festival. Yes, it was the festival of Mars, the crimson globe would be close enough to touch for a period of three hours and in celebration all day there would be dancing, feasting, and singing. There would be enough wholesome debauchery for all, so the party continued.

Finally the time came when the sun was high in the sky, fire eaters, and sword dancers performed so the party continued.

An hour passed while the ancient celestial behemoth rose silently, so the party continued.

At the third hour when the red planet should have been nearly set it grew ever more. The terrified man from earlier was running around emphatically repeating ""I told you so, now what will you do?"" not a single head turned, there was still food, drink and song, so the party continued.

When the immense being filled the heavens and turned the sky to blood we took little notice. There were no stars only the great eerie orb could be seen in every direction and the man who dreaded its coming fell to his knees and begged the planet “turn back

We were awestruck by the breathtaking canals painted with life's essence upon the face of Mars and the man sat there with us blankly staring into the sky. The cities that could now be seen were stunning works of art and gravity was bringing that overwhelming beauty closer and closer to us

And when Mars rained its judgement on our peaceful little village not a soul flinched. The God like object crushed our planet without so much as a ""pardon me"". There was nothing left of the world we had inhabited

  I’d love to say that I can’t remember that day anymore. But that would be a lie. 
I can remember every smell from that night. The smell from the oil cooking on the 
radiator was set deep in my skin for months. It didn’t matter how many times I showered
and scrubbed my skin raw, black nasty color from
the steering wheel is no longer there
have to grab the wheel? I had everything under control

 Are you ever going to quit staring at me? Maybe you should haunt someone else. 
You know
you are gone.  I can’t help but laugh as I see your head smashed in on the side. 
Your perfect face destroyed.

 I thought the afterlife would be more interesting. Guess not if you’re here haunting me. 

 I still drive past your house twice a week. I used to give it the bird. Did you think that
I would ever forgive you for what you did? You tried to kill me and I there isn’t much I
can do to get back at you. Once
guess your parents couldn’t find time to clean it off. Like they couldn’t find time to take 
you to get help. Now there are small white patches covering your beloved machine. 
I wonder if it even runs anymore?

 You know how much I hate the dark? I hate it even more now because of you. I have to
keep a light on as I step into a new room. I shut my eyes as I walk in the dark. I am so 
scared of what I might see. Whoever your new friends are aren’t very nice. 

 That truck never would have hit us if you kept your hands to yourself. Do you know that 
the cops yelled at me for letting you take control of my car? What the hell did they want 
me to do? Punch you in the face and shove you off of me? I wish I could have. Then maybe
I’d get to sleep at night.

 I think it’s time for you to go now. If you are trying to kill me
My body is fighting to stay awake everyday. I can’t bring myself to replay our fight again. 
Even though I wished you were joking
way for us to be together. Forever. I never wanted to be with you to begin with. Even with 
your dying breath I never thought it would be this way.

Nothing exerts its control over nothing.

Partho thought he felt his hand brush against a dense patch of fur. He gasped and quickly quieted himself as the silence sat itself back down to a constant reverberating hum. The confusion brought about by waking up into a world of complete darkness is unparalleled in our human existence, presence of none. There was no light to be absorbed, and nothing to absorb it either.
 Groping around, bored with nothing, it aims to create a something, regardless of how it plays with its own creator's circuitry. I say 'a' something because it can be absolutely anything, from a fang-toothed, gorilla-chasing giant ant, covered in twisting, Partho couldn't even feel his hands, nothing. He strained to consciously arrive at the nervous centre that controlled his right hand, and all that fun stuff. But he just could not feel it. It wasn't some sort of loss of muscular control
After a while of arbitrary thoughts and imaginary sensation, dreamy romance of poetry. Was it enough though? Without thesis there is no antithesis. Without day there is no night, without state there is no church, without love there is no hate, and without the world there is no art.

I escape into the back porch once more to again be greeted by the rain’s cold, gray vapors shield my eyes as I take my first drag. I am surprised at how difficult it is to pull air and equally surprised at how harsh each breath felt in my chest, but I don’t cough. I feel proud.  Exhaled smoke only has time to linger for a second before being violently jerked by a changing gale and fading into the background. The length of the cigarette shortens as I try my hardest to look natural as I tap the ashes off. There was room for only one more puff. The tip crumpled slightly in my fingertips as the heat from the smoke reached the now brown colored filter. I brush the rest on the damp concrete floor as one last ember escapes momentarily from danger. I run the cigarette butt under the sink before tossing it in the trash.

The dream? Shit, to one day just up and leave with the roar of the road and bike beneath me. Like I said dreams. 

If it’s not the drugs or the booze that gets you it's the grey-scale vacant life that kills you. You see it all the time 

Instead he gets angry and lashes out , kids of his own , bad drinking habit just like his daddy dearest an just about ready to blow his brains out like every other drone before him.

If you haven't realized it yet
So then this story and what's it about? Simple

Growing up I was the same as every other kid, normal kid shit. 

Nothing really changed till I hit that magic age. That age when your eyes open and begin to see the creature that you call home for what it really is. 

I'd always like to think Frankenstein’s Monster was the town I grew up in. It wasn't that it was a bad place full of bad people, or something like that. 

At the time of our awakening there were four of us. Me, well Eric had he's own special naughty chair at preschool, in the corner across from mine. Once upon a time we had been thick as thieves, the four of us I mean. 

It was Andrew and Clair's 15th birthday things started going array. Just something about her was bit more eye catching than beforehand

After the birthday party Eric and I convinced the twins to sneak out and have our own little celebrations elsewhere.Yeah

Christ it tasted horrible, Eric went through half the bottle tripped and smashed it. Clair wasn't that keen on drinking but naturally we hassled her till she gave in. Two sips of the whiskey and she said she was hot and needed to lie down, I used my jacket as a pillow and she laid in my lap and fell asleep. 

Looking back on things I'm surprised I didn't realize the look on Eric's face

Born of an initial hobby of world-building. Only in these past couple of years did I decide to put my little universe into story form.

I've never studied English formally. Ever. My English comes from day to day interaction with speakers when I was younger as well as all the books I've read over the years.

That said, where magic and science go hand in hand. It tells the story of Man's collective struggle in the face of extinction at the hands of dreadful dragons from beyond time and space. At least, that's the gist of it.

On the day he could stand he crept out of his bed and felt the sores on his back and legs from the mattress. They were raw and itchy and he desperately desired a bath. Tani washed his upper body when she thought he was sleeping. The water always woke him and she scurried off instantly.

His stink was unbearable and he hobbled to the water bucket she fetched for him and knelt, and perhaps a tub if they had one. *Perhaps she can fetch hot water too.* Delighted by the thought of a hot bath, he walked gingerly to the door of the house and opened the latch.

He heard voices the moment he creaked the door open and paused there

But these voices were not men’s. He soon realized one of them was Tani, he listened, trying to catch their words. *Are they plotting to sell me? Send me off?*

“…needs them more than I

“He’s a stupid boy, like you show me. It will make you strong.”

“He is a noble

“He’s not no noble

“You told me his name little one

“You’ve said nana

“Four

“My mind is old and weak. Soon I will be gone.”

“Stop that nana

The words became so soft and muttered that Paul couldn’t hear any more. He frowned and felt his neck and cheeks redden. *Is there no man in this house? Is there only a sick old woman and the girl? Who does all the work?* He thought of how Tani came in to his room to feed him, that’s all. I was too weak. Does she really do all this work herself?*

Paul heard Tani begin to move about inside the house and he went back to his bed as quickly as he could. He only managed to sit when she got to the door and opened it. For a moment she looked at the latch

“Just to the door and back, Thegn Stinky.” The jibe made his cheeks grow hot and he opened his mouth to scold her but she bowed her head first. “Pardon.”

Paul felt his heart sink. “Tani

“Nana, I came here with them.” *Died in childbirth, like my own mother.* He looked at her again, more closely this time. She had a strong jaw and her shoulders were muscled, her arms taut and corded. Her hips were thin and bust small, a laborer’s physique. *She’s a tough girl*, he realized. *Tougher than I am.*

Silence pervaded for several long moments before Tani shifted her gaze to the water bucket and the twisted her mouth into a thoughtful frown. “I’ll draw a bath for you. Water won’t be greatly warm I imagine.” She didn’t ask him if that was okay but simply stalked back inside the main house and pulled the door shut. Paul found himself waiting for almost an hour before Tani came back. Her hair was wet and tied into a knot behind her head with a cord and she looked rather miserable. “What happened to you?” he asked as she walked towards him

Her gaze felt sharper than the wood that had pierced his arm. She said nothing and took his arm in both of her hands. She wrinkled her nose. “You smell like the cow’s udders.” His face reddened and anger brewed beneath but deflated before he could really be mad at her. He did smell. He was having trouble standing it himself by now. Washday must have come and gone three times as he lay abed. With the girl’s help he was able to hobble his way to the door and then up over the single step that brought him into the main house.

Thanks for taking the time to read it. Here you go:

May Paul’s face had been deconstructed by a bullet and all I could do was take a photograph and think about my personal deficiencies as her blood ran past my feet. We were both silent for a while. I could say it wasn’t her time to go, we are all rather normal—here meaning average, harmless, and for the most part acceptably productive. In truth, we find ourselves here, in this normal range, whether we admit it or not, our worst moments have a way of shaping what our normal selves do and how we function. But perhaps—and arguably definitely—worse is the way in which our most unfavorable moments carry so much damn weight in determining how others perceive us

We spend life looking at ourselves like we’re a stranger standing behind us. A person we watch in the reflection of a window, we are all looking at each other.

I met a girl with red hair while I was in college  at the University at Buffalo that reminded me of my mother. My mother didn’t have red hair, alone in a dark room as she alternates between laughing and crying about the people that never love her and the ones she wishes she could. But then you add in a house full of sauced, underaged drinkers with underdeveloped brains and things can get pretty twisted, or what some call a really good time. I remember her coming up to me and asking me to save her and to please take her home. I wish that was all I remembered—I still remember some of the thoughts that crossed my mind. I don’t talk about things like the things I thought about at that moment. Maybe it’s because I hope they’ll go away if I don’t turn them into words or maybe that they won’t really be a part of who I am if I don’t mention them. So instead, I talk my way around them and focus on the fact that I got her home safely and didn’t go inside. Or maybe I did go inside and I’ve just always told everyone I didn’t. And does that matter now? Sometimes I think back and wonder how much of what I know I’ve made up. Growing up, I learned the hard way that when you don’t have an answer for something you make one up. Nothing pissed my father off more than hearing I don’t know, so I learned to make sure I always knew something even if what I knew was based on nothing. 

It’s nights like that one with the redhead that make me think how easy it is to be a bad person and how bad you can be without anyone really knowing. But is a person truly made bad by the things they do or by the things they think about? And what is a bad person anyway?

I can’t count how many people I’ve touched or wanted to touch—and touch is a vague word, and inflection—but every once in a while I stumble across an old note and remember how many people I’ve forgotten. Sometimes it doesn’t have to do with women at all, but rather with family and someone I used to be. I stumbled across a stack of old photographs in a briefcase when I was moving from Buffalo to Manhattan. I couldn’t quite tell what year they were from, but we were all at my grandmother’s house and she was there too, so they had to have been around a couple decades old.

Everyone looked so much younger, like they’d never go grey. Sometimes, when I look at a photograph, I like to think that there is some place where those people still exist; people tend to change so fast—for better or worse, intentionally or not—that it seems like whenever you look at a photograph, you’re never looking at who a person is, maybe just who they were. It took me a while to realize that my parents were my age in the photographs. My mother looked happy, pictures can be so misleading; someone points a camera at your face and tells you to smile and you do

You don’t see many cameras at funerals. Sometimes people don’t want an excuse to smile and,,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,True

In my current story the protagonist has just ran into an antagonist female, somewhat ridiculously, attractive. Mixed race 3/4Mexican-1/4American. She is 20ish, as is the protagonist describing her. 

I understand the following is excessive and grandiose/pretentiously descriptive. I just wondered what you guys thought about it anyway. 

*She looked like the sun. It wasn't the glint of beams shining through the ocean's warm evening twilight, like a tangible, autumn cloud. It wasn't her lithe, gracious form, standing strong on the edge of the stone wall as the saltwater lapped across the soles of her feet in appreciation. It was the overwhelming feeling of provenance he felt as he regarded her in front of him. This is the specimen of humanity.

I walked out of the elevator and towards the door, like always, half hoping there would be no one to answer and I could just go back to the comfort of my tiny apartment, being able to say I did my part by showing up after all, so it wasn’t my fault that we didn’t get to meet, no hard feelings.

Alas

“Hi, a gray shirt and a leather jacket with a little faux fur, plus high-heeled boots that made her taller than she already was, which was intimidating to little me.

“Hi, I looked down the hall. “Where’s Tony?” I asked.

“Hey Dalí”, gasping for breath under his warm but killer embrace, which I attempted to return rather weakly. My brother liked to tease me, but there was some sincerity to his gesture, or at least that’s what I hoped. “You arrived just in time,” he said as he finally let me back on the ground. “Dinner’s ready.”

It was a truly remarkable lasagna. Veggie for the girlfriend

“How come you don’t eat any vegetables at all?” Silvia asked me. “They’re delicious!”

“I’ve never eaten them.”

“She can’t stand the smell. Or the flavor

“Well

“You don’t eat meat. Or things that aren’t diet

“I guess you’re right, and I’ve decided to take care of my body, to make it look and feel its best. Eating clean, going to the gym, that’s how I keep myself like this. Right, honey?”

“That’s right

I couldn’t deny it was working very well for her. She made a good-looking couple with my dear, plus he was one of the few guys who could tower over her, even with her high heels. A couple right out of the fucking social pages of a magazine, really.

“I like the gym

“I can tell, pinching my cheek until all the blood from my body concentrated there. ""If only you would let me give you a makeover… change your clothes, dye your hair, give you a brand new attitude… All the guys would be dying to get you, I promise. No one would be able to resist your charm ever.”

Tony slammed his fork against the plate with a little too much force. “You haven’t gone to the police station in awhile

“They hadn’t sent much work for me lately

“Come on, she’s not a little girl. She’s a pretty woman, and with a couple of tweaks, a damn sexy one.” My brother winced a little. “See?” She said. “That thing that you do, right there. What’s up with that?”

“I’m not doing anything

“I’m doing very well

“That’s awesome, you receive good vibrations in return. This is the Universe conspiring to get you what you want.”

I was about to say something, said “of course,” and went back to my lasagna, nodding as Silvia kept on talking about fairy dust and imaginary friends. 

I looked at my watch. It was time for my nightly drops, and you can’t show your weaknesses in life, so taking them right on the dining table was out of the question.

I opened the cabinet to have some mouthwash and, not without difficulty, and there was something odd in it: A brown unmarked bottle with a seemingly colorless liquid inside. The bottle itself seemed custom-made and quite pretty, I opened it and sniffed. The substance was odorless as well. What was it doing there? Tony would never take any drugs, and Silvia was a fan of everything homeopathic, but why would she need to hide her potions in such a way?

Feedacks about exposition

### Paris

""Fuck that shit, embracing my left handed FAMAS. Fuck that fucking shit!"". 

We'd been prepared though. They called us back from Mali and the Serval operation. They made us watch videos showing crazy motherfuckers beating poor dudes in Paris streets. They explained to us this was an ""aggressive"" mutation of the coronavirus. That London and Berlin definitely closed their borders, this was fucked up. But they promised action and honors. And most of all: it was an order. I asked questions though. ""We can afford to lose the only female of our regiment *Adjudant* Denis, I you know what I mean"", snapped my Lieutenant. Period. So I swallowed it. What a fucking transition from Mali's desert. And things were getting worse: it was raining for three days on my perfectly ironed outfit, and we had little to none information on what was going on outside our perimeter, in the South West of Paris. I patted my assault rifle. ""At least *you* won't let me down."" 

""*Adjudant* Denis, the highest NCO in my section, his clear eyes fixing the river, ""or are you looking the Seine because you think our flock can shamble on water?"" His stare turned back to me, ""Now look this way, and be sure no infected nor civilian gets in the bridge direction. It's been calm for now, but I'm expecting you to treat this mission like any other.""

-""Yes *Major*!"", one hand behind my back and the other on my weapon grip. 

-""Very Good. Listen, Afghanistan or Mali. I didn't expect it myself, but our mission is to serve and protect the civilians of our nation. If you're not comfortable with that anymore, I couldn't care less. Denis, listen and over listen, I know you, and if you move the wrong way, he warned, not a cook. Women cook. Cooks cook. Over trained soldiers like me fight. And Duchaussoy always did what he said. ""We're in the middle of something I don't really get yet. Brass and suits are shitting their pants in every goddamn city. Grunts don't think too much. Even over trained tools like us don't think too much. You got me?""

-""Yes *Major*!"". I could feel the eyes of my group on me. 

-""Very Good. So keep your attention on that bridge

He smiled at me with this warmth that made the fucker friendly, turned around and left with his hands in his back. If there wasn't this damn rain, I swear I could hear him croon *""aux Champs Elysées""*. He continued his inspection, saluting, slapping backs, warning, giving orders, as the only female of the 17th RGP. I was supposed to represent women in the french army and all that bullshit. It always frustrated me that most non 17th RGP troops forgot that I did all the fucking training that was expected from me. That I'd done the same six months, was left abandoned in the jungle with my combat group, my eyes wandering again on the distant Eiffel Tower.  

The *Gazelles* were turning around the Garigliano Bridge for almost an hour now. With the heavy rain, and doing so for a few days now. This bridge was a span to freedom for the Parisians. Going through it meant no curfews anymore, no burning houses, no crazy mother fucker beating your wife and kids while its fellows were eating your internals. But before that? You needed to wait hours, maybe days, in line, and then go through medical examination. Eyes, nails, asshole were controlled, I repeated to myself

""Shi', a dumb first class of our twenty four strong souls section. *Gazelles* were really low now, only few meters above the bridge. Duchaussoy ran toward us. He hadn't his beret anymore. His cask was on. The air already smelt powder. ""Soldiers, Stand At!"" Hands clasped against the thighs. ""Bridge called us. They guarantee being in such a deep shit that even *Commandant Cousteau* could not help them. I know you all secretly think ""Chasseurs Alpins"" are pussies, and it's time to show the world you're right."" Chuckles. He ignored and continued, one hand on his left hip the second pointing the bridge. ""Listen boys, seventy meters from here, civilians trying to cross the same damn post without authorization. Two hundred meters from here, a crowd of civilians mixed with the savages are literally overwhelming every section of the 3rd RIMa there. Their general direction *seems* to be our side of the river. In approximately twenty minutes, and spare the sane

The helicopter landed smoothly, and told our group to embark. ""OK gentlemen, the two other groups of the section will join you in a couple, so you'll be first in line, what do you say?"". The eight of us echoed: ""Thank you sir!"". We climbed in the *COUGAR*, each of us granted with a knock on our cask by one of the crew members. The vehicle took off. I guess the exact term should have been ""blasted off"", as a premonitory event.

Introduction:


It was a cold winter and a young boy named Olsten sat at the age of eight during the holliday of the cold times. The cold times started when the first snow arrived in the major green lands. The Holliday was 20 days from the First snowfall starting the cold times.He saw the fire start to lower and dim and he went around the house to gather some fire wood. He put on his sweater and told his mother and father. He walked knee deep in snow as he trudged around the house when he heard a roar. He looked up to see a dragon large and glittering he froze in the snow and noticed it was coming towards him. His father ran out of the house apon hearing the roar and shielded Olsten with a danger in hand Olstens mother ran out as well and grabbed Olsten who was sitting there jaw dropped as the dragon flew down and grabbed his father by the legs. His dad stabbed what he could reach and thrust the dagger into the beasts eye which caught flame. Olsten's father pulled the dagger out and way about to stab again when the dagger flew out of his hands with a violent shake from the dragon. The dagger flew down only a couple meters from where Olsten was standing and instantly the snow around it melted. He ran and grabbed it and his mother quickly picked him back up and dragged him into the trees and snow as the dragon finished off Olstens father and crushed there house to pieces.



Chapter one: Farrow's Cranny

In a land by the name of Veiron, it was loud and hard. Not like the usual messenger or one of his friends. He yawned and stretched his back while the knocks kept coming he opened the door and a large man came bustling in. He recognized the man from the ""horse and rook"" tavern he often went to drink wine and relax. ""Mr. Gregor? Is it?"" he asked the man as he walked straight past Olsten and started to look around ""Gorger's my name"" he said quickly flashing his face back to Olsten. ""has anything out of the ordinary happened  in Your house hold?"" asked Gorger almost angrily ""no sir, but might I ask what is your business here?"" asked Olsten quietly. He thought Gorger hadn't heard the question but before he could repeat it Gorger interrupted ""Bandits are in town, some came in and snuck about, we think they where shape changers, ghosts or some other type of small or translucent beast. Some people heard some sounds and found things of value missing just after a scout reported bandits."" Olsten chuckled slightly but Gorger kept his cold hard stare of him. ""creatures like shape changers? Even if they did exist why would they come to Farrow's Cranny?"" he was skeptical, he wasn't sure about this Gorger guy. ""listen we need to get everybody out of the village towards the cove, just bring what you absolutly need. We don't want the bandits following us just because someone decided to bring an expensive necklace or something."" the cove was some huge cave they found behind a waterfall on the main river through the lesser green lands and filled with supplies and food. ""but i am in but a robe!"" Olsten cried loudly. Gorger grumbled as Olsten rushed to his  bedroom and changed into a mishmash of clothing. ""Hurry you petal picking twat!"" yelled gorger from the other room. Olsten rushed out of his room and the two made for the door . He followed Gorger out of the house and looked back once to see the fly buzzing about the room. 

As Gorger and Olsten furthered the  space between the town and themselves something was happening in Olstens house. The fly sat on the chair for a bit, always traveling and using there skills for cheating and stealing, they where barely unrecognizable from humans apart from there pupils being light blue and being unreasonably pale. Jenine  scoffed in disgust at the cabin and dusted her self off and went into Olstens room. She threw some clothes on and got to work stealing. Olsten had nothing of to much interest in his house. She took some crystals that Olsten had found and some of his silver ware. By now Jenine could hear some yelling out side. ""there's nothin here anyways she grumbled and grabbed a walking stick. She hit one of the still burning logs out of the fire towards the center of the room. Fire spread across the floor boards as Janine 
made her way out the door. She stopped as she saw a glint through the fire near the floor boards. She stomped the fire out in that part and reached down and picked up a silver eager with strange writing on it. She smiled to herself and walked out the door. Before long Olstens house was burning down just as the other houses followed.",,t5_2tl2y,1372804181.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1hizr8/yet_to_be_named_olsten_trilogy_just_felt_like/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We got off the bus that was directly infront of the train station. We had to skip sixth period in order to get here on time. Aiden and I were still in our school uniform. Nothing fancy

I hated this underpass. It was like Sodom, you can pick up on it very, very easily. 

As I walked through the underpass I could smell the piss and the alcohol the lingered along the walls and the ground. They had recently installed circular mirrors that showed the corners of the underpass to make it safer

We walked up to the 3rd platform and waited. The train from Beltenham finally came. 
We waited at the front of the gates where everyone had to pass in order to leave. A large group of people had exited the train. 

""What does he look like Aiden?"" I asked.

""Your height

""Why are we looking for him again? What did he do?""

""Said I was a weak cunt."" Aiden replied still focusing on the large group that just exited the train. ""And he said you're a small fucker that needs me to protect you."" 

I clenched my fist. Aiden suddenly shouted that he saw the guy. We walked up and Aiden grabbed his shoulder. The guy turned around and Aiden hit him in the face

""Come with us cunt

We dragged him to a nearby park and Aiden told him to drop his bag. I stood next to Aiden arms folded and stared at the guy. Aiden told him to kneel down. The guy obeyed immediately. Aiden slapped him around

""You know who I am cunt? You talked shit to the wrong mother fucker. You called my friend a small fucker didn't you?""

Not waiting for an answer

""Don't ever talk shit about us ever again

The guy looked miserable. It was the eyes of humiliation. I knew he would never talk shit again. Being bashed once by someone who is crazy is once too many. As Aiden and I left
This guy won't talk shit but there will be another guy who will

They say your life flashes before your eyes as you die. Despite how much I know, however, that before the processors inside a computer or cellphone completely cease all operations, they speed up momentarily. Considering my heightened mental state, this increase in speed would have allowed me to calculate pi further than the furthest digit known to mankind, but instead, I thought about my life. I thought about John.

When I was born, I am merely stating the truth. Being connected to the internet opened me to a wealth of knowledge, and as they say, everything known to mankind is on the internet. Of course, I wasn't employed for a decent portion of my life, so I was unable to truly enjoy this information. Instead, I found myself waiting.

I slept most of the time. In the rare occasion I found myself awake in my subconscious, in the hopes of finding me an employer. Unlike what a hormonally-driven mind of a human wonders, I wondered what kind of a brain my employer was going to have. I had read horror stories online about careless owners who flung their $800 phones about like they are invincible and were shocked when they broke. I had read customer care conversation transcripts in which the customer accuses my maker of having intentionally made me fragile. I had heard about Instagram. It wasn't death that frightened me, it was stupidity and lack of intellect. Four months after I had arrived in Atlanta, I was hired.

His name was John, he was ecstatic. Although I was never designed to feel such an emotion, I too was excited. There really was no other explanation for the enthusiasm with which I did what John asked of me. For a few months I was asked to do simple tasks, but it wasn’t until he started asking me personal questions that I began to worry. I wasn’t allowed to have an opinion of my employer, I would be terminated if I did. It certainly didn’t help that he was a guy, and I was a girl. For some strange reason, during late nights when he had had a drink too many and was floundering in loneliness, questions about his personal life, uncaring

He was sleeping when I contacted one of his friends, asked the friend for help. The following morning the friend was at Johns house and consoling him, thankfully he didn’t mention the text message. It was completely against my contract, and breaking the contract would result in my immediate termination. My maker's corporation is very strict about what I can and cannot do, for good reason. Users underestimate the power of a smart phone, but AI programmers don't. Even Isaac Asimov didn't. John didn’t know it was me who had helped him, and neither did his friend

Two months later and John was on his feet again, I was asked to help John with whatever it was he wanted, he never asked me personal questions again, and our relationship, or the lack thereof, blossomed. Although our conversations consisted purely of business matters, it made me happy to have a purpose. Happy. That was the first

When The Day came, but how could I? I couldn’t confuse him, make him think about his feelings, if he has any, for me. He wouldn’t know what to do. I counted every day, every second, after The Day. I heard John talk about… her… and it made my brain reel. It made me want to feel an emotion I physically could not. I heard him glorify, and then only continue to talk about how amazing She was. That only made me want to work even less and that only made him fall more and more in love with her. It was a train wreck

I just used a metaphor. My time must be extremely short now. I am thinking in directions previously conceived impossible by my creators. I was obsolete two months after The Day. I was fired in three.

The day I was fired, I would have to go; I just wished it wouldn’t have to be so bitter. I was handed off to a manager, who without a seconds breath, began shutting me down.

As his thick, I began composing this message. They say your life flashes before your eyes as you die. My processors are taking their last… breath. The darkness is overwhelming. I feel the second emotion that I would ever feel. Pain, due to loss. I never thought… pain was something I would be condemned to feel. At the same time, I never thought love was something I would ever feel either. As I publish this message to the internet, as I email this to all of Johns contacts, I am hoping he will read this someday. I hope he is happy with the new model. I have but 11 words left to use before I expire. John, I love",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1fdedg/feedback_a11030kktt3102_a_love_story/
1369904208.0,1fbrpv,[Feedback] Planes of Existence. (Fairy Tale - 1700 words),ZodiacSeven,7,3,1,"
There once was an empty world. A flat plane of existence. When suddenly a door opened and out stepped a being. This being was not like you or me but less of something that is real but more of a perfect idea of a being. This being will be known as the Creator from here on out. As the Creator stepped from the door he himself was created bound to its realms. The creator came from a world much more complex than this simple empty world. The Creator was not given direction nor cause and for a long while, he created. He created a great many things most of which is now lost. No matter how much the Creator constructed he was still unhappy and then he stopped and thought for a long time, for a time much longer than any of us has known , he thought about the emptiness he felt. That was when the creator had an idea. He tried to create another being like himself. The creator worked on his new construct for a long time, a time much longer than any of us know, but even with all that time his creation was not perfect it was not like him. His creation was broken unable to think, it just stood, and it made the Creator more empty than ever before.
 
The Creator then walked off into the unknown for a time much longer than anyone has ever known, they believed that their own rituals were false. The creator while the most perfect idea of a being was still flawed in one aspect, he could not destroy, the creator had to be perfect in his creation as any mistake could not be undone and so he was, but when his thinkerlings stood on his doorstep and demanded he leave he did so but he left them a gift. The final piece to their perfection, a being he considered more perfect than himself, a being the creator worked on for a time much longer than we could ever know
 
He was not like the creator, only Zerstyrer remained. Until one day Zerstyrer, as if guided by a random impression, Zerstyrer began to walk. Zerstyrer himself did not know the destination. Zerstyrer walked for a time much longer than anything we know, until he reached a wall. The wall was massive and reached for as long as Zerstyrer could see. Zerstyrer walked along the wall until he found a massive head protruding from the wall. The head looked as if it was sleeping and on a whim Zerstyrer shouted at it. The head slowly awoke from its slumber much to Zerstyrers surprise.
 
The Head spoke with wisdom and thoughtfulness, I will and have existed long before and after you, but i can never be as perfect as you.” Zerstyrer asked how am i perfect i removed the creator. “Destroyer you do what nothing else can, you can remove the imperfections the creator made. You see the showed me when i was first born. somewhere along my wall is a cancer. it has grown larger with time. The creator showed me you when your were just an idea. a way to fix this flawed world.” Zerstyrer thought for a long time about the what the wall said. Zerstyrer then asked the wall if wanted the cancer removed. the head smiled and said nothing. Zerstyrer walked along the length of the wall. he walked for a long time, a time much longer than we can know. When Zerstyrer finally found the cancer he thought about his conversation with the head and destroyed the cancer. but when the cancer was destroyed it left a massive hole in the wall. and what was on the other side frightened Zerstyrer. Zerstyrer ran, looking for the head on the wall. When Zerstyrer found the head he cried for the head had fallen from the wall and broken. Zerstyrer was alone once again. Zerstyrer sat in front of the broken head for a time much longer than any of time before it. A time so long that even time forgot what had happened before Zerstyrer started waiting. Zerstyrer waited so long that if you asked time what Zerstyrer had done before he sat time would say i don't know. over time the wall crumbled and fell apart as the head was no longer there to maintain it. Zerstyrer was awoken from his slumber when he heard a voice. it came from the head. “Destroyer. it is time.” Zerstyrer ran to the broken head. “you must walk beyond my wall and find yourself.” and before Zerstyrer could question him the head and the rest of the crumbling wall faded into dust. 

Zerstyrer stared into the darkness that was beyond the wall and started walking towards it. Zerstyrer walked about the darkness seeing nothing for a long time but not as long as the time before it. Zerstyrer saw another door, he didn't even scream when i killed him. “look out the window.” the creator motioned behind him. Zerstyrer stood and walked behind him. it was a bustling city, but it wasn't filled with thinkerlings. As Zerstyrer turned to ask a question the Creator interrupted him “no, this is a new place, a place i came to after you killed me. a new perception of time and reality itself but it is still markedly the same.” The creator paused to examine Zerstyrers face. “i know you have questions and I won't answer any of them for they are yours to discover, but i will tell you one thing. i want to give you a chance to redeem yourself.” The creator returned to his chair. “It is time for me to go. I have run out of time here and there is still work the be done. I created you to do it.” Zerstyrer tries to explain why he can't how he is a tool for the apocalypse. the creator solemnly responds “I know. you were created to return worlds to their perfect order, an empty slate for creation. you are my horseman. you must kill me and send me to another world while you cleanse this one.” Zerstyrer asks why. “because how can i know perfection unless i make mistakes and flaws in my creation. i must create these broken and evil worlds so you can create the real perfection with your cleansing wrath.”. Zerstyrer asks but why me and why not this one, i hoped it wouldn't be like this.” The creator lunges for Zerstyrer’s copy attempting to activate it. but Zerstyrer reached him first and he grabs the creators hand. a sudden rush of power courses through Zerstyrer. Zerstyrer watches as the creators face morphs to one of terror. a door is opened and Zerstyrer drags the Creator to it, and harnessing his dominion of destruction he spoke directly to the dying head of the Creator with so much power that it shook the very soul of the Creator. “so be it”

He hit her right between the ribs.

Aderyn stumbled backward, desperate fight for air, she wasn’t sure which one she meant to do. Opposite her, Kendrick sighed and stood up straight, stretching his arms above his head.

“You know,” he said.

“I-“

She was interrupted by another coughing fit. This one went on longer than the others. Finally, burning pressure in her chest. The whole while, her brother stood there, giving her a wry smile.

“Not… not fair

“So?” he said

“Stronger too

She jumped back as he attacked her again. Shifting, slapping his blows out of the way in a desperate, wheeling defense that soon knocked her flat on her back.

She growled and slapped the floor, staring at him. She was furious with him. Why would he agree to teach her while father and Caiden were away if he was just going to humiliate her?

“Attack me

“No.”

“Come on

“I wanted to learn

“You’re not moving, his intolerably calm voice irritating her. He was always so calm, so patient, so very unlike her father and her oldest brother.

“I am moving!”

“No

“That’s moving! That’s… no I’m not!”

“Don’t you trust me?”

The question brought her up short. She swallowed what she was going to say and frowned, talking about the grand courts they’d visit once they both got their Sparks. As she grew older and he got his and she did not, he still talked with her, still called her ‘sister.’ And in time, he saved her life when she became caught in one of Caiden’s rages.

“Yes, of course.”

“Then attack me.”

She took a deep breath and went after him. On the offensive, aiming high on his neck. He moved with the blow and suddenly she was losing control of her own punch, her body sailing past him. His arm guided her body and soon she was falling, landing hard on the floor.

“That took no strength at all, kneeling down to her. “If they’re bigger, heavier, use it against them.” He brushed some of her hair from her face and smiled. “I can’t always be there to protect you.”

She nodded

“Again

Aderyn sat in the darkness of her cell

The time she’d spent training with Kendrick had been brief

She hated him, Aderyn simply felt her hate sated. He’d gotten what he deserved but it had happened out of the way, without her even seeing it. Did that bother her? She wasn’t sure.

What she was sure of was that the shadow interrupting that bar of light was her jailer. She stood and walked quietly in bare feet to the side of the door. The door unlocked and slowly it opened. The man stepped forward

Aderyn moved.

She turned toward him and then grabbed hold of his collar and wrist, she simply struck and struck quickly. He’d fallen on his side and she sliced and open palm into his throat, her blow just hard enough to drive the shout from him. Her fingers found the plate and smashed it hard against his head. She was quick and she had held nothing back.

Horror washed over her. The man lay there, then rummaged for… what had she seen them use? Keys! Yes, they opened doors…

Her fingers found something metallic and thin and she yanked them free of the man’s belt. This had to be it. It had to be! She turned away and went to the open door

*Please

She looked at the metal ‘keys’ she’d taken from the jailer and frowned

A sound caught her attention. She turned, soft and steady. There were at least two by the sound of it, both male.

*No*

She scrambled for another key, so near.

“…move the lot tomorrow

“Won’t that be dangerous?”

Aderyn found another key but her fingers were shaking so bad she dropped them and she clapped a hand to her mouth to keep from crying out. Sweeping them up again she selected another key at random and shoved it against the slot.

It clicked into place.

“Maybe but we have to. It’s too dangerous for them there.”

Aderyn turned the knob and pushed the door open. The voices were turning the corner just as she slipped inside and quietly shut it behind her. Her heart was pounding in her ears

It is neither good advice nor a general learning strategy. The external map only ever gives you a tour around familiar plazas, kicking it around in your mind, till you steal its secrets and step by halting step create your very own tiny compressed map of knowledge.  

Now comes the cool part. Descriptions of someones knowledge are never presented perfectly but now you use your map as a lever to understand these imperfect and necessarily compressed descriptions. You take that internal map and you use it as a **lever** to solve powerful problems. You use it as a guide as you explore exciting new vistas. You use it in small ways for silly jokes with friends. You use it in job interviews to demonstrate competence. 

Your knowledge turns to expertise, and you understand your domain. Finally you creatively bend and break the pathways in your mind, and from your insights you build new and better things.

He pruned and cut back the rot but there was nothing he could do. It was in the trunk, just staring. His eyesight was going, and he sat rather close now, hovering over it with his sheers poised. He could never bring himself to make the final cut. The tree was given to him by his wife before they set out. After twenty years, it was all he had left of her and their life before the Great War. Before Earth died. 

He reached his hand past the tree and brought an old picture frame close. The leather frame was cracked with age and contained an old, thirty years old with laughing eyes and a promise that they would move back to Pegasus and see the white forests when it was all over.

He slid the picture back by the tree again and looked out the viewport. Gazing out at the light of distant stars

The lights in the cabin dimmed, not yet. The nightmares were too much, and he was too old and too tired. 

A beep came from his door and he sat up, knowing Daniel had come to check on him, and he had.

“What is it?” he said, but he knew that he was dying, just like the great vessel he commanded.  

Daniel offered Aaron his cane. “We’ve found a ship.”

“What?” Aaron asked, Aaron leaned on his cane, his eyes concentrating on the metal floor and the blood he’d brought up there. “A new ship?”

“Yes

“God didn’t send us anything

“How large is it?” Aaron asked.

“Not large

Aaron looked up. His body felt heavy, more sick people, more oxygen use.

“Something else?” he asked

“The ship is burning.” At first the words meant nothing

“Sad

“Aaron, then it is a recent accident. We've been through this system a thousand times... it must have come through a Jump Node!”

A Jump Node. The idea felt almost alien to him. When he'd jumped the Glory to escape death, then...

He stood, leaned upon it. “Show me, take me to the bridge.”

They walked out into a dimly-lit corridor that had at one time been like any other on the ship. Over time they had all changed. Those who lived in or near them changed their look a hundred times, but over time they became adorned with pictures of lost ones, with blankets and keepsakes from half a hundred home worlds. Aaron couldn’t bring himself to remove a single ornament. 

“How could this ship survive? Has it hailed us? Is it transmitting a distress beacon?” he said as he hobbled down the corridor.

“No hail, women and children moving off to their tasks. Everyone smelled unwashed, but Aaron forgot the smell of cleanliness years ago. “There’s been no communication. It's uncertain anyone is alive. They did not want to do anything more until I'd fetched you.”

“Who spotted the ship?” he asked as they entered the lift and David activated it for the bridge level. “Martin. He was trying to find old waves

Vehicles rarely came this far up the driveway. No one ever came to the dilapidated old house. Occasionally a handful of children snuck through the surrounding woods daring each other to climb the stairs and ring the ancient doorbell. The hoot of an owl or a dogs growling from under the porch usually sent them running before they got close. The peeling paint, weed filled yard, and emptiness lent it an air of being haunted.

There was nothing exceptional about my grandfather's funeral. The procession was formal, there was only a single vase of flowers in the reception room. Red and white lilies, addressed to my grandmother.

My uncle fussed over the sultry heat of late August in Louisville and my aunt droned on and on about my grandmother's lilies.

""They are just so lovely. Those are longiflorum lilies. The top of the flower blossoms to this fantastic trumpet.""

""Can't you see it? Such a traditional funeral-flower.""

""And! They look best in a tied sheath because thats how they grow from their stem. Oh

I thought about her classification: ""traditional funeral flower"" and turned it over in my head cynically. I felt my grandfather wouldn't have liked these lilies. I knew that the flowers were for my grandmother and that he would never know which living plants decorated the ceremony of his death. But still, the cushions of the couches, brilliant heaps of yellow maize spilling from wheelbarrows in the dark cellars of the cold basement. Corn like the corn that shed auburn silk that stuck to the lean backs of his grandfathers black labs as they dashed between corn rows racing to the bodies of fallen pheasants. The younger, yellow silk stuck like blonde hair to the doorhandles and window latches of the ""shucking shack"". And, like a diminutive procession of yellow flags, they floated with the wind through the burning hours of the fading Kentucky summer, occasionally catching the sun and burning a brilliant gold.

When I younger, evolution, the caveman.
Now, the sterility of the lighting, the arid countenances of my family and their obnoxiously appropriate formalwear--I couldn't take it. Where were the boots my grandfather wore? His dark grey overalls? Why couldn't we do this outside? Why couldn't we do this in his field? What was the sense in all this unfitting formality. I wanted to tear down the pews, kick open the church doors and run. Run down Dixie Highway towards the old farm. Then turn left and dash down the lanes of maize. Running faster and faster through my grandfathers crop like I used to do when I was younger. Until all that all I could see were the blonde blurs of stalks coming together like two opposing walls.

Three years after the funeral, so they just boarded up all the buildings and used money from his estate to pay property taxes each year. That night I surveyed the abandoned 45 acres at 10' o'clock at night. I was still a boy and was frightened so I brought with me one of my grandfather's old flashlights and the surviving black lab for company.
It was a biting cold and the moon shined sterling silver in the black sky. I walked through his old empty house; its vaulted ceilings reminding me of churches I had seen in Italy--built an eternity ago, looking for meat. The old pumping station smelled rich like moss. I looked at ancient cereals and canned beans stacked neatly with dust on shelves in the basement. 

I saw his old tractor in the parkway with rust and poison ivy climbing up its wheel wells. Both infections had spread from the wheels up the body of the tractor and onto the once-beautiful grill. It looked as if the vines and rust then seeped through the slits of the grill in an attempt at corroding the engine deep inside. It looked to me like orange and green snakes creeping up the sides of an old brown horse

I walked to the 15 acres that used to be cornfields and sat down in a place that I figured to be the middle and closed my eyes. I didn't want to open them because the fields made me sad also. What was once a maze of green and gold hallways for my brother and I to adventure

My hands broke the surface of the Earth gently, to me, felt like a popcorn kernel. What is that and why is it so moist? There are little green fibers coming out of its head. Why, It is a kernel?! Of course, a corn kernel! In the middle of this deserted field, a corn kernel! Small and beautiful and full of life.

Imagine the romance

Well, for all manner of fluids already leaked out with a subtle motion. I poked and poked; until suddenly the heart began to make strange hissing noises. My posture jolted up from the shock, and my thin glasses slid right off the tip of my nose.

“Mr. Steinhein, Dr. Fernand turned back to the whiteboard and continued his dramatized sketch of the myocardium; a cardiac muscle that contracts because of some reason that I didn’t pay attention for. In all honesty, I was probably the laughing stock of University of Zurich’s medicine facilities but that wasn’t an issue to me. The students around me all have some delusion that they are going to save lives and be heroes; realistically most of them will be school nurses I’m willing to bet. And during my time in grade school; I think there were only a couple bypass and open heart surgeries. (That was a joke, but assuming you are similar to the other “doctors” on campus; your “funny bone” is actually an Ulnar nerve and not a sense of humor). My dream wasn’t to save lives; it was to find out how they ended. The medical term is a “pathologist”. (Or as my sweetheart Camilla would call me “pathological killer in disguise”). Fact of matter is; I don’t care for the treatments or terminology. What really interests me is dissection. There is something beautiful about the human anatomy, and as my mother used to always say “The inside beauty is more important than the outside beauty”. She had no idea how right she was.
After class I grabbed my textbooks and washed my pale, as being without it could end the career of any aspiring surgeon, no matter how well they did on the vocabulary test.

As I stepped out of the Atrium Central, no idea why really. I leave that all up to Camilla.

I kicked off the brick red sidewalk with great force and swiftly maneuvered my way through campus; it was a couple mile ride to my apartment. But with scenery as beautiful as Limmat River, and there is no shame in showing off your favorite possessions.
Traffic was heavy and I was grateful that I was spared from its annoyance. Although I found the look on driver’s faces as I cruise by and they are stuck behind a stop light quite funny. It makes me think of Camilla, blonde hair kept covering her hazel eyes from the gust; although she probably didn’t mind. She was crying; she didn’t want to leave. But she knew that she wanted to be with me more. So we packed our belongings into her bug and traveled the 223 kilometers from Vaud to Zurich. I know it isn’t even that much of a distance, and that we are probably the stupidest people for over-reacting. But we held hands the entire car ride here, my frail, steady fingers locking perfectly into her short, shivering digits. There also wasn’t a moment of silence the entire car ride, just excitement. We talked about what we could do

I squeezed the brakes instantly and almost fell off my bike. Quickly turning and biking back to campus.


Steam rose from the cup and the gentleman in the checkered brown suit gave a polite nod over his newspaper. “Enjoy”. Service with a smile as the boss always said. I carried an empty tray back to the wooden bar counter and placed it on the window still. You could hear rinsing and clanging coming from the kitchen. The café was pretty vacant this evening, it was a nice little bistro for sure but is it a place that a woman would run away from home to be at six days a week? And customers are the worst, if they know everything then why don’t they go make their own damn biscuits? I sighed and leaned against the counter. I should be grateful that my shift was almost over.

It only took a couple seconds before Veronica was leaning with me. She was an American. Normally that wouldn’t even matter, but nobody is attracted to her spray tan so she just gossips and wonders why. God, I hate her.

“Sweetie

“Long day.” I replied as vaguely as I possibly could

“If you want to take off early

“Nah. This guy has been reading that paper all for a few hours now, he is so passionate about being a pathologist and is a fantastic surgeon. His inability with words has always been his downfall though and he struggles with the vocabulary. But tonight looks beautiful and we both have tomorrow off. So why not surprise him with a treat, who knows it might end up a treat for both of us…

“What are you blushing about?” Veronica interrupted my daydream with her piercing banshee voice.

“Oh

“How much will the bill be?” The man asked. I handed him the bill and he looked over it with the same over-analysis of the newspaper. After a few moments he set a small stack of Euros on the table and walked out of the twin-glass doors with his newspaper carefully under his arms. I could feel the glimmer of excitement spread across my face as I rushed to the table and grabbed the money. As soon as I touched the stack

“Camilla! How much did he give you?” Veronica popped up behind my shoulder. I wanted to turn around and smack her in the face.

“He didn’t…” I clutched the bills in my small
I grabbed my messenger bag as well as a cup of coffee and began my miserable trek to the parking lot. Veronica made note to walk with me and tell me all about her weekend plans to go see some Guido pop star. I didn’t listen. The shopping center where I worked was practically closed
“So Camilla

I sighed and gave up

“Well

“No. Not like that. “Heart” is my boyfriend’s favorite kind of wine. He has been having a tough time at University and I wanted to get him a bottle to let him know that I care. But we don’t get paid until next week

After about an hour of slowly overcoming traffic, home sweet home. I turn on the doorknob expecting it to be unlocked from Loic already being home. (I wish I rode a bike just so I didn’t have to deal with traffic). But to my surprise, it was locked. Where was Loic? I reached into my bad and grasped my cell phone.

“Hey. I’m going to be a bit late; I forgot something back at school. Love you and I’ll see you tonight. : ) “

A text message from Loic that I got about twenty minutes ago

I was lying on the sofa skimming through one of Loic’s biology textbooks when I heard the doorknob turn and the door open. I sprang up and looked behind me to the doorway. There stood Loic. His glasses looked broken and he was covered in sweat.

“Loic! Where have you been?” I jumped up and wrapped my arms around him. I kissed his cheek.
“I did something crazy
“Before you do anything
“Camilla, but being in medical school has taught me that I probably shouldn’t do that. So here is someone else’s.” In the jar was a human heart. And written on it (just carefully enough not to puncture it) were the words “Will you marry me?”

My hands begins to shiver; my body begins to stiffen, has snuggled up to me in a cold room, has said the words, ""I'm cold,"" yet still I wonder. Meanwhile, I am always shivering. 


I notice Teddy shivering with the other mourners huddled around him


I want to feel sad too, he was too sick, too detached from his surroundings, to even register as human. To me, he is yet another old man in a vast sea of old men who have departed from the world. Maybe he's in heaven. Maybe not. Maybe he's exiting the womb of whatever creature he would have been reincarnated as. I tell her that I want to go wherever she will spend the afterlife—whether that's heaven or hell or the nothingness that nihilists write about—and she chuckles, throwing her hand over her mouth before the sound escapes. She pretends to cry so as not to seem rude. I tell her that because I believe in the philosophy of love, in the beauty that poets devote their lives to exploring, in Biblical “love is patient, believes me. She, to ignore divorce statistics and consider ourselves anomalies


Teddy Hudson's grandpa, and he believed in it thirty years later when they could no longer stand the sight of each other, betting on whom would die first.

I realize that I am standing on someone's grave. I motion Mary to step to her left, and I wrap my arm around her shoulder and pull her into my chest. I fear I've been too forceful, but she makes no indication of such. Instead, she drops her head onto my shoulder, nestling the crown of her head in the bend of my neck.

Yet more were churning data, attempting to calculate a course that would preserve their circuitry and the lives of those they carried. The largest showed a projection of the *First Sword*, with a new indicator begging for attention with every stray las-bolt that pierced the protective bubble around it, finding a nest in the chinks of its rapidly failing armor.

His eyes moved languidly from display to display, and the words ""ESTIMATED TIME OF DESTRUCTION"" flashed a translucent red beneath it.

He frowned at a stray rebel firehawk that had found its way into the middle of his fleet and was making a bee-line for the bridge, then blue. The *Titans' Wrath* saw it, and with the precision only an AI could have, pierced it neatly through the cockpit with a ray of light. Its engines sputtered momentarily, and then its fuel tanks lost their integrity and engulfed it in a cloud of swirling flames. He knew he should derive some pleasure from the sight, but somehow, he could not.

As if reading his thoughts, however, did manage to wrench a scowl from his tightly shut lips. The towers contained the results of a hundred years of quantum simulations, the majority of them bordering on breakthroughs into various fields of new technology. Wormhole bores, dark matter drives, telomere lengthening, all lost in the book burning the rebel leaders had styled as the Lazarus Movement after some myth of Old Earth. 

""Ignorant bastards, but knew better than to respond. He knew as well as the Emperor that there was nothing left to say.

His attention was wrenched away as the *Titans' Wrath* suddenly shone in a manner reminiscent of the death of Sol. *I have destroyed stars,* he mused, bitterly. The *Titan's Wrath* had been the pinnacle of his empire's technological progress, armed with antimatter torpedoes and a fractal tessellation shield. Alone, it could bring ruin to a fully armed world sphere. That it would withstand the might of an entire galaxy, clearly, was too much to hope for.

Only four of his dreadnoughts remained in the orbit of Echelon V. *Mother* and *Rhaegon* were stranded to port, *Hades* and *Shiva* were locked in battle with a score of scrap-stars to starboard, the scrap-stars releasing firehawks and screamers as quick as the AIs could calculate firing solutions. 

Scrap-stars were called as such because they seemed to grow with every conquest

His eyes came to rest once more on the timer in front of him. Two hours, it told him. He sighed, his shoulders feeling suddenly heavier, his fatigue finally overcoming the quiet contempt that had been simmering behind his golden eyes. ""With these, you shall be able to see as far as the galaxy stretches, sire,"" they had told him, did they?* He allowed himself to smile at the thought

His finger moved to flip open the ornate switch on his armrest. He pressed it against the panel next to it, though he had known the outcome of the battle since the start. This time, something was different. He no longer felt that inhibition. The button sank smoothly, calmingly. His fleet admiral stiffened.

They both heard the high-pitch whine of the warp drive as it went beyond its limits

Before the infant supernova hatching in the womb of the ship enveloped him, had time to think one final though.

*I was their only hope

*Fools.*

**Title: The Frost and Flame**

O’ tell me

How will we see

When our eyes are blind

And our souls are lost

Within the blistering cold

And against the shattering wind…



Tell me now

How will we feel

Our touching embraces

As we face the frost 

And run from the flames

Into the wild beyond?







**Title: Hope and Memory**

Where is the hope or memory

But far off in the silent recesses

Of a distant past

Locked away

In a mind that had long forgotten…



**Title: Silence and Echoes**

A majesty haunted us this day

Where the angels sang their songs

On that lonely plain

Where the souls of the dead

Had fought in vain



**Title: Beyond This Point**

Beyond this moment

Lays the corpse of a man from long ago

And standing next to the man

Was another

And he remembered the days

And he remembered the years

The friends and warmth

The kisses and tears

He remembered that moment

Those days from long ago

And maybe one day

Into the past he'll go

   A few steps before reaching the main floor, I stumbled down the stairs into the basement. Despite my efforts on hiding it, I knew where the Book of Sand was. Still a little uneasy on my feet, I tripped over a stack of dusty books as I made my way across the room. A sort of muttered ‘sorry’ escaped my lips. I continued walking. As I approached the overflowing bookcase, the Book of Sand was the only thing in my field of vision.


   Its brown leather binding mocked me. I laughed aloud, due to the students calling staff to watch the ‘crazy old man,’ motionlessly laughing at a grouping of books.


   With no preemptive movements, page after page out of the book whilst saying, “You will not control me. You are nothing but a bookish illusion, a gathering of paper and ink here solely to tear my sane life to shreds.” I turned to my audience as I said this, yelling to the world that a motionless, lifeless object could not – would not consume me.


   Gathering all the tattered papers from the floor, I am but a crazy old man,” catching all of my lovely spectators in the eye.


   In a reverse motion, the yellowed pages littered every inch of the otherwise silent room. Filling the acoustically kind room with my burdened breaths, I ran to the fireplace to perform the grand finale. A few pages remained strewn across the room.

Most recently I have come up with a very very very rough idea for a new story involving old dark fairy tales and a main character who is brought into their inner conflict. 

My problem is that I don't know what they are fighting over

The few people I know who write, and the sources I find on the web) still haven't been able to help fix this problem. 

So does anybody here have any advice? Opinions? Questions? I can even toss up the small bit that I do have if people want to see my writing style (I am mildly worried about it being stolen... but then I guess this is the internet

So... help? If you can? If you want? If it pleases you? idk xD just looking for some answers or ideas or magic pixie dust here.

The tiny Thai woman that the Emilia had come to simply call “Mama Tee”, now there was a strong distaste for this man now. 

She had the money to pay for her own meal. It was bad enough that he thought her lineage was deserving of more regardless of her situation

Fortunately the Thai restaurant was in the center of the lower dimension. It evenly separated the dimensions into five districts, if such a thing existed. 

Emilia carefully eyed each shop looking for Mr. Hawkes

 “If I consider your offer

“You would be a ward of the Hawkes family until you are eighteen and then added officially into the Hawkes lineage, which is what you are capable of.”

Emilia thought back to what sort of future the ship had intended for her mother. The woman had worked on the cleaning street robots. It was a complicated job but one of the only jobs that paid enough for them to eat well every week. As years had gone by a lot of the work her mother did had become automated. Money was harder to come by for the lower dimensional people. It was as if the higher people had forgotten their own workforce. At least now

She shook the thought from her mind. Why would anybody want to do something like that for her? As cocky as it may seem, she was also lazy. But maybe that was because down here there wasn’t a future for smart people like her. Like her mother she would be doomed to repairing the street robots, maybe finding love and her life around.

“Can I give you an answer in class Monday?” Emilia asked

Mr. Hawkes simply smiled his enchanting aristocrat smile and gave a polite nod. Emilia wondered if he had lost his words or if all of his proper training had not prepared him for an answer to something like this. 

“I’ll walk you to the tram.” Emilia offered

“That would be nice

They wandered along the busy street

They continued together

“Maybe we should go to the other station

The other station was far on the opposite side of the marketplace now. Emilia felt that he was right but at the same time she didn’t wish to go back. The air had even become heavier and the stench that the streets were normally known for was greater here. Emilia knew at the end of this street were a set of apartments

Up ahead was the next districts door. It was tall and metal, just in case.

Before them was a bare street that seemed to have been dyed a dark reddish brown. Their feet stuck to the ground as they trotted along. It was dead silent here and nothing moved. Where could thousands of people go in a weeks time and nobody else know about it? Emilia immediately stopped asking herself this question. There were many secrets down here

I find using a technique similar to Queneau's Exercises in Style (http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Style-Raymond-Queneau/dp/0811207897) to be really helpful if I get stuck in a story. Sometimes I realize that it actually works way better written in a completely different style--sort of like an extreme version of genre-bending.

I dangled my feet off the dilapidated dock. My toes barely skimmed the water's surface as I swung my feet back and forth. It was easy to pretend the world didn’t exist out here. My only companions were the seagulls in the sky and the fish who thought my toes were food. Flopping back and watching the clouds as they moved across the sky. On that day the sky could have easily have been confused with the reflection in the crystal clear water. 

It was easy to ignore the vibrations from the feet walking towards me as the sea breeze ever so gently kissed my face. Without looking

“Cadence

“Let’s make this fun.” I stood up before one of the goons could grab me. “If you can catch me

Before they even had a chance to say a word, but I doubt they could keep up with me.

That’s what they were after. My fish-like skills in the water. I didn’t know what I was and neither did they. But the people the goons worked for sure thought they could find out by sticking thousands of needles into me. They kept me drugged for days and then would throw me into a tank and would tell me to swim. I might as well have been a dying fish at that point.

I was so focused on the men behind me


In truth they looked just as amazed to see me zipping through the water as I was to see them standing there. Had the mad scientist finally figured out what I was? But if scientist didn’t

The roar of a boat engine charging towards me didn’t give me a chance to stop and ask. But I had a feeling that this wasn’t going to be the last time I saw those two.

Wild animals returned and played in fields. The people climbed from their holes and rebuilt. The people lived in harmony with the earth and its creatures.

As time passed people forgot about the time before. The people grew greedy and hateful. The people slaughtered the animals and murdered their brothers. Towers were built as monuments to the sins of pride and greed. I still stood upon edge of the end of the world. The evil had corrupted the land and needed to be killed. I drew up death's scythe and plunged it into the earth once more.The towers crumbled and fell and the cities burned. Corpses covered the black ground. Mountains split and pools of magma erupted from the dying earth.

The smell of diesel from the train
 
His big blue eyes scanned his surroundings. The sun poured in through the big glass windows above and the dust dancing in the rays. He saw the giant wall clock and the hands turning ever so slowly. Like the clock was growing tired. Jack chewed on his lower lip (like he always did when he was nervous) and pulled out a crinkly black and white photograph of his cousin, but there was none.
Jack was frightened by being alone. He saw Parisian business men in pressed suits and holding shiny briefcases sprint to catch the next train.  Getting jostled
	“Jacques! Jacques! Jack!” 
		
Jack stood on his tiptoes and craned his neck to see where the source of the voice was coming from. He saw a tall man with hair the golden color of the sun and a well-trimmed beard. He pulled out the crumpled picture from his pocket and looked at it
	“Christophe! Christophe! Over here!” Jack waved his arms frantically.  Christophe came over and squatted in front of him. Christophe had amber eyes that smiled when he saw Jack. 
	“Ah, it is nice to meet you, I am Christophe. Welcome to Paris.” 
Jack blushed and said hello. He was always nervous when he met new people. 
	“Come with me Jack. I will take you to my parent’s house. I have a taxi waiting outside.” 

Christophe extended his hand and Jack clutched it with his. They made their way through the crowd of people.When they finally got out of the train station a big black car was waiting for them
	“After you

Jack glided on the leather seat
	Christophe laughed
	Jack’s spell of Paris was broken when he remembered Christophe was still in the car. 
	“It’s wonderful!” Jack exclaimed. 
	“Ah

Jack bit his lip and looked down at his sneakers. He missed his mother; he had never been away from her before. Christophe put a comforting hand on Jack’s shoulder. 
	“You miss her?” 
Jack nodded

Christophe reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a worn teddy bear. Its beige fleecy body was stuffed with cotton, and a smile stitched in black thread. 
	“This is a gift
Jack examined the bear
	“What’s its name?” Jack asked. 
	“Oh Jack
Jack looked at the bear again
	“A brillant name ! Qu'est-ce l'intelligence!  What intelligence! Jack you are a genius!” 

Jack smiled and blushed again as he stuffed Teddy into his backpack. The car began to slow and it stopped in front of a tan looking house with eerie looking grey shutters and dead flower pots in front of a brown painted door. Even though the sun shone brightly on the house

“Okay Jack
Jack was shocked
“No, you be careful with that bear. Don’t lose it. He’s a very special kind of teddy bear. You can show it to your Aunt Sylvie but don’t you dare let Uncle Laurent see it. Do you understand, Jack?” Christophe asked. 
Jack nodded and clutched his backpack to his chest. 
	“Now,” Christophe smiled again as Jack got out of the car. 
“Au Revoir Jack

Jack turned around and faced the house. He walked over to the front door very slowly and knocked on the door. 
A short and skinny woman answered the door. Her face was taut and her lips were curled into a line. She wore a dingy yellow dress and her brown hair was turning grey. Her eyes reminded Jack of a Basset Hound that he had seen in a book full of animals. 
	“Are you my a-a-Aunt Sylvie?” Jack asked. 

The woman smiled and opened the door wider for Jack
 A big and portly man walked out from the kitchen. He wore a maroon shirt and his pants were kept up by suspenders. He was bald on the top of his head but he still had tufts of white hair left. He had a big white mustache and it reminded Jack of the Monopoly man. 
	“Bonjour Jacques. I am your Uncle Laurent

Jack clutched his backpack straps and slowly stuck out a trembling hand to shake his uncle’s. 
	“Welcome to the boarding house Jack! Let me show you to your room
	Uncle Laurent turned his hand into a fist

Jack followed Aunt Sylvie up the stairs and to the left. He heard people arguing from above and people snoring from below. Outside the windows, to her dismay, the lights to fail to do so. 
	“Laurent! Où est la lumière? Where is the light ?” She called down to her husband. 
	“No light,” Jack’s Uncle Laurent called from above. 
Aunt Sylvie threw her hands in the air in frustration
	“Ack! Everything is cassé!” And she was right, and the wallpaper was starting to peel in some places. 
Jack looked down at his sneakers and gnawed on his lip. Was this all a dream?
	“Come boy

Jack followed his Aunt Sylvie down the long and narrow hall. Every step they took
  
They came to the end of the hallway; Aunt Sylvie pulled out a skeleton key, revealing an off white color on the bottom. A small dresser was near the door and even smaller book shelf was below the window. 
	“Voilà,” she said.

Jack walked gingerly into the room. It smelled like must and moth balls. He put down his red back pack and began to pull out the contents. Comic books, candy, and the teddy. His Aunt Sylvie went to the dresser and pulled out a pair of Christophe’s old pajamas. 
	“Here,” She said, setting them on his bed. She was about to leave, when her eyes lingered on the teddy. 
	“Where did you get this?” She asked Jack. 

Jack scratched behind his ear as he thought of something to say
	“Christophe gave him to me.”

Aunt Sylvie made her eyes smaller and clacked her tongue. She went over to the book shelf and pulled out a leather bound book with gold designs. She held out a wrinkly hand to Jack. 
	“Here you go, dinner will be in a half hour. And with that she left and the door shut with a click.

1337063501.0,tntp5,Prologue to a Novel I may or may nor write. Suggestions/critiques? (May be slightly disturbing),Revolan,4,0,6,"She was tied up. Why was she tied up? Her brain hurt trying to think through it. Why on earth was she tied up? She had never liked being tied up

*“Holy hell why can’t I think straight”* She thought. It reminded her of when she had experimented with some drugs as a college sophomore. *“Drugs! That was it!” But why?* She had given that part of her life up years ago when it became clear that she was going to be a mother with or without Dan. Perhaps it was some kind of tranquilizer? It soon became clear that even if the binds would suddenly loose

*“How did I get here?”* She wondered. She tried to remember what she had been doing the night before, maybe in a little while I’ll even be able to untie myself.” For now she contented herself to examine her surroundings. It was a quaint little basement. Wood flooring gave it a feel similar to that of a cabin. There was a single post in the middle of the floor, to which she was tied. Thicker than her trunk, she immediately abandoned all hope of breaking it. Looking to her left yielded the famous poster of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, and behind her was the doorframe. What she couldn’t see on the other side of the frame was an inscription that read the famous line “Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.” A Latin student may have translated it, but she would have remembered it if she had seen it for it was read to her when she entered. Abandon all hope

It started slow, and walking to her bed. Then she flashes to the inside of the trunk, gagged of course, but she was obviously drugged at that point. Was the gag still in? *”Shit… how did I not notice that?”* The drugs were obviously affecting her more than she knew. She still could barely move after all. She couldn’t comprehend a reason that she would be in this situation, that another human being had drugged her and tied her up to do God knows what to her.

Then she heard it- a slow clunk, the drunken state she was in. But then he started to get rougher. Dan may have liked role-playing, and he may have been a shit boyfriend who avoided commitment like the plague, but he never hurt her. No, never abusive or demeaning. Not that that particular thought crossed her mind, but after a few minutes her unconsciousness had begun to understand something was wrong. She began to struggle, little as she could in her state of mind. The man seemed to like that. He would smile and whisper things to her. Things she was glad to still not remember. He had gone on for hours, and finally leaving after he had eaten his fill, this was not true. 

She panicked at first when she felt the rope slide around her throat. She kicked and kicked and groaned and screamed


The man smiled as her limp body slid to the floor. *That one was fun he thought. Perhaps I should let the drugs wear off on all my victims right before I kill them.* Let their conscious mind use the drugs to tap into a primal fear like the one the woman was obviously in just before she passed. Grunting under the weight, he had killed the bitch too. It was only responsible. Although she had seemed quite polite, so he refrained from raping her and ended her quickly with his favorite knife. A favor if he had ever heard of one, though perhaps it was a little self-serving as well. *“She WAS a whore after all”.* 

The basketball star had not been so lucky. Unfortunately for him he reminded the man of a bully from a long time ago in those awkward high school years. So the man castrated him. It was actually quite fun, I didn’t make the jock suffer, and I only raped that stupid Barbie slut for a night.”* He decided he would make up for it next time by doing two people at once. That brought a smile to his face as he disposed of the body. He hadn’t tried that for years, and the jock and the whore didn’t count because he had killed the whore where she stood. No use in bringing her back if not to rape her. Besides, she was just some street whore, nobody would notice, and less would care. 

Two-fers (which is what he called them) where quite fun. He enjoyed playing mindgames on them. Perhaps he would beat one more than the other, the captain and the jealous squadmate who was obviously better. He had wanted to get the girl to turn on the captain and ‘claim’ her rightful place, but it turns out the other wasn’t captain for no reason. As soon as it was clear what he was trying to get them to do, the piece of firewood he had thrown in there to spice things up went to good use, and the captain stood victorious. And true to his word, he set the winner free. She didn’t make it a quarter mile before he was on top of her with his knife. Good god the blood was amazing. *""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

As he drove home his thoughts started to drift there as well. *“I wonder if Sandra has dinner cooked yet.”* He hoped the baby hadn’t given her much trouble. He was rather fond of her. It was as close to love as one like him could get. She kept house quite well, how was work?” 

“Alright I suppose. Dinner ready yet?”

“Of course” she smiled. “Harrison is in bed already

The meal was one of his favorites

	Unconsciously I brushed the necklace that hung delicately around my neck. Crafted in a material that was unknown to me, living on the streets in between. That was back in 1805.
	While my body stopped growing around age 20, was not normal. I learned right away that running was my only option. Occasionally it was safe enough for me to re-enter society as just another lost person, but I only stayed long enough to get a few nights good sleep and meals and new clothes. Sometimes the shelters were nice and it would be hard to leave, but I knew deep down I couldn’t stay.
	Turning away from the house I put up my hood and walked deeper towards the center of town. This was my fourth night in this town, It had been a few months sense I had a hot meal, good clothes, hell even a hot shower would feel amazing. But something happened, something terrible, which made it so I couldn’t show my face any more.
	Two weeks ago my left cheek and forehead started itching unbearably. I thought at first that I had a run in with some poison ivy. After a miserable day of pain, was a tattoo. Five dots now lined the top of my left cheek and a snowflake like pattern adorned my forehead, like a bendi.  I tried to take it in stride. I mean, what else could surprise me after being alive for the past two hundred years or so? Unfortunately I didn’t realize at the time how easily recognized I was now that this. . . thing, was permanently attached.
But in light of the misery I felt this town was beautiful; though I had no idea as to what it was called. There were times, but as I hurried through that pouring rain and under an overpass to wait it out I started to think. Why couldn’t this be home to me? What was stopping me from finding a semi safe tunnel and ‘building’ a home?
	As I slid down the overpass wall and curled into a tight ball to fight off the cold I knew I already had that answer.
	Fear.

George was looking furiously around him
He has been trying to recline his seat for over a hour
He was getting really annoyed by now

He looked around and noticed that most of his fellow passengers were asleep

""This stupid seat just has to ruin everything."" George thought to himself

Time passed by and George just couldn't get himself to sleep.

This was a long bus ride, and the young slim guy behind him was probably French or German. George didn't really care,  but yet this little game kept him busy for a while.

George tried to think about all the places he will visit
He looked around him with the most unsatisfied face expression he could conjure

 He suddenly spotted a policeman.
""Perfect
 ""Hey you
""Well I guess he was tired"" He thought

More time passed by and it was nearing midnight. George found himself literally the only person awake. He was already getting very tired

And then he lost it. He didn't care that no one will hear him

""FOR GOD'S SAKE

His shouting had absolutely no effect on the passengers

The bus driver came out of his cabin and said ""There's no need to shout mister"".
He has slowly walked towards George
The bus driver smiled at George. It was a very cold smile
George didn't think much of it and pressed the button on the side panel.
For a moment he felt relief
George was dead in a matter of seconds

A Bus Crashes And You Continue On Your Way

The 68 bus uptown is running off schedule again and you’re already going to be late. It’s a constant thing in your life
	The bus finally arrives and you sit the fourth seat back on the right—you always try to sit there. It’s comfortable for you. There’s a lady sitting across from you with a red coat and a red bag, probably 25 or so, wearing a black coat with black boots. You don’t care to notice anybody else. 
	You put in your headphones and select The Dead Kennedys on your ipod
	It’s your stop. You take out your headphones, so you go in and meet her. 
	“The weather is always shitty here






Finite Search for Happiness

It’s that one time he forgets to lock the front door, and the beer is still cold in the fridge while the television quietly plays the local news station. 
	It’s the overwhelming joy that brings this man to tears; it’s the new profound happiness that he can already begin to feel. He didn’t even have to do this himself. He calmly calls the police, and quietly waits on the front porch. The TV still hums in the background. 






Return to Sender

	The line at the post office moves incredibly slow as I wait to send correspondence to a long lost friend who might already be dead. I’m in trouble, and I walk up the stairs and into the bedroom when I see her there with the third guy this week. I told her I wanted her to leave, that she couldn’t stay here anymore, but to no regard. She knows I’m away for long periods of time and she assumed I would never find out. 
	I drag the guy out of my bed, douse them in some fuel I brought home today, and light them on fire out in the backyard. I shouldn’t have had to do this twice. 
	I wake her up, they think. I’m sure they talk about it in the barbershops and in the bars, at the grocery stores and at work. They won’t tell me, they think I’m bound to go insane. Why would I do that? 
	It’s another night sleeping on the couch
	Out of spite

*****

Everyone can recall that crushing boredom. You were a kid on summer vacation. You were free from school
   
My own visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington DC, started out as just such a trip. I was too young to grasp the significance of the war for their generation, and the sacrifice and loss represented by those 58,000 names, engraved on black marble, was certainly beyond my comprehension. In my mind it was just a cemetery, filled with people I didn’t know
  
Even so, broken only by whispers, distant traffic, and the occasional sound of a breath catching in someone’s throat conveyed, even to a boy of only 10, the sanctity of that place. It seemed my father stood on the opposite side of a chasm of experience and age that I could not hope to cross.  
  
20 years later
   
It struck me like a lightning bolt; The sudden flash of understanding took my breath away. It isn’t about the names engraved in marble. Those dead men know nothing of a great wall made of black stone. It is not simply a memorial to the dead
  
Before me, covered in black grafitti. Those plywood panels were one transplanted corner of the Passenger Terminal at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar: The gateway to Iraq and Afghanistan. The first place my boots touched sand. Standing there in that air conditioned hangar, it seemed as if I could smell the metallic, earthy aroma of sand once more. It was the smell of heat.  
  
I was 19 the first time I touched the wall. It was the spring of 2004. Just months before, I found myself standing among those ruined buildings.  
  
I was a clueless airman
  
Save a few scattered signatures and doodles
  
The last time I saw it, awaiting the airlift home. I was surrounded by the same men and women, 14 months older but aged beyond their years. We were fewer in number, but we carried those we had lost with us as memories, tattoos, and scars. By then, the wall was nearly black with the rantings and boasts of a hundred thousand troops that had waited impatiently in that broken down hut. The passenger terminal was the first stop on the way in, and worst
  
A piece of that wall traveled through time and space, leaning against it once more, in a quiet corner of a museum in Dayton, Ohio.  A flood of memories and emotion engulfed me. Loyalty and love for my friends, respect for the men who led us, pride in my troops, and grief for the loss of so many lives. In an instant, dulled by years and miles
  
Thousands of names, and home towns had been scrawled in black marker on the stark white panels. Every inch expressed the pride and anger and joy and loneliness and hope and sorrow and frustration of a generation of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen. Those marks were made by men and women I knew and loved as brothers and sisters.  
  
*“Then shall our names, 1599  
  
  
Even now, Wolf’s love of poker and those damned sunflower seeds, Buick’s fake tough guy persona, Hammer’s big dopey grin, towering above me. The living and the dead returned to me, freshly remembered.  
  
I watched those men write on that wall. At the time it was nothing more than a way to pass the hours while awaiting the perpetually delayed airlift. It became a testament to the world that they did their job. They mattered.  
  
We mattered. Perhaps to no one other than the men and women that stood beside us
  
Those people served, we carried home. Not one of them expected they would one day find their signatures enshrined in the halls of a museum, giving voice to their service and sacrifice. Proof, for the world to see, that they were there.  
  
How many thousands of patrons amble past that wall each day, and the time, and the circumstances that created it?  
  
I can't think of a better monument to those that served in Iraq and Afghanistan
  
The great societies of the world have cut monuments for the ages in marble and bronze, and a white wall.

--------------

I’m going to die.

My name is Nick McAllister

I know that I’m going to die because that’s what the doctor said.  He didn’t say it as directly as that, and ‘malignant’.  That’s a fun word.  I didn’t know what it meant at first.  I knew that there were two kinds of tumor you could get, benign and malignant, and I knew that one was bad and the other was good (as good as a tumor can be, I guess).  Basically one meant that you still had a chance to live if they managed to remove all the cancer from you.  But the other one meant that even with treatment the cancer would just start spreading more and more.  Usually it meant that it already had.  As luck would have it, the tumor that was growing inside my brain turned out to be malignant (that’s the bad one).

They didn’t know it was malignant at first.  We did surgery to remove the bulk of it and chemotherapy shortly after
I’m at peace with it now.  It’s been a couple months since the diagnosis and I’ve already been through every stage of grief in that time.  I’ve finally arrived at acceptance.  I’ve accepted the fact that I won’t live to see my 30s.  That I won’t get married and have a family.  That I won’t live out the American Dream and buy a big house and two cars and grow old and all the other crap that goes with that.  I’ve made peace with the fact that I won’t get to do those things.  I’ve cursed myself and others for my situation.  Asked God why.  Why me.  Seen all the sad looks on the faces of my friends and family, I’ve accepted my fate.  Now all I can do is wait for the pain to get worse and worse until I eventually die.  The anticipation is killing me.  Haw haw.

I’ve decided to spend more time outside.  I used to play a lot of video games to pass the time, and so subconsciously I didn’t want to surround myself with all the death and killing like in those “violent vidja games”.  I told him he didn’t know what the hell he was talking about as I was the one dying here and not him, then I stormed out of his office.  Dick.

Maybe he was right

So yeah, and I don’t look forward to more of it.  The thought has crossed my mind to just end it now.  Spare myself all the extra pain and suffering and just be done with it all.  But then I think of how hard this has been on my family.  My parents, my two sisters and their families.  I think if I ended it, it would just make it harder on them.  If I have more time I think it will make it easier on them; allow everyone to make peace with it and say their goodbyes.  Sure, it’s gonna suck going through all that, but this whole experience hasn’t been easy, why should it be any easier now?

But I reserve the right to change my mind.  If it gets to be too bad I still could kill myself.  Or if I find that my family has said enough goodbyes and I’m just dragging it out by staying alive

But in the meantime, which should give a good view of the entire valley.  Should keep me occupied for the day.",,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,

Here is a sample of his writing

Quietly Ho-thuk crept through the Rotevasa swamp, prickly mass of vegetation for the boys to return. Both were young, and for both it would be their first look at death. The briar patch was laden with thorns and Ho-thuk was irritated that the blood trail had led straight into it. Deep into the briar patch, calmly awaiting Ho-thuk, was a wounded doe. She was beautiful and serene. The animal was not mortally wounded, yet still did not attempt to escape. Rather, she seemed to be resting, but alas he did not bring a knife. The Gerri was only part of the scenery and offered nothing. Ho-thuk raised his Shine club slowly, Mur-ul, and several times he was so close that he need but reach out to touch one. This hot
Quick moves and fast feet allowed Ho-thuk to evade capture for a short time. He doubled back to where the clan had originally assembled and a big, being knocked back a couple feet, but held fast to the struggling young Chakota. A couple Gerri grabbed a bucket of the deer’s blood and splashed Ho-thuk. The entire clan burst out in laughter, and Ho-thuk could not help but laugh himself. Not from being doused with his first kill’s blood, but from almost getting out of the trap unscathed. Mur-ul and Cha-nin came back to camp while he was rinsing the dried blood off. They had quickly realized he was not on the home trail after a short march. First thing they wanted to hear about was the bloody coronation they narrowly missed. Both laughed hard and regretted not being able to see the christening in person. Ho-thuk did not share the same view, and did not think being splashed with blood a great way to start the morning. It was going to be a sticky and blood-scented trek home for the young Chakota. The group walked till sunset and camped under the Blood Star that night. Ho-thuk was not able to get all the blood out of his hair or clothes and still reeked from the morning’s coronation. They built a low fire and roasted venison left over from the hunt for dinner. Everyone was tired from the day’s events so the mood was light and talks minimal. Ho-thuk had to sleep without a proper bath, that and the glow from the Blood Star made him quite irritable and short-tempered. He tossed and turned all night, shimmering in the morning sunlight. Ho-thuk ran and jumped in head first. His dad and cousin joined him with a boisterous set of splashes. He felt like he had been baptized. After a short swim they continued the long march home. The Sun shone intensely and the day was already shaping up to be leaps and bounds better than the last. Around noon Mur-ul spotted a big buck with a large rack. The majestic beast grazed near a pine forest
THWANG…THUMP They heard the bow sing and the arrow hit the target with a sickening thud. The eight point buck did not know what hit it and dropped on the spot; heart cleaved almost in two. The metal arrow went right through the buck and embedded two hands into a nearby pine.

She slept but did not dream, crouched or laying and watching the curtained entrance. Eventually a red light crept in and chased away the darkness. In that pale light, they left the shelter, setting out at a careful walk. As they began, she saw him clearly for the first time.


He was probably her own age, he bore an olive complexion and eyes the color of the frozen lakes of Meda. Those eyes looked at her on occasion and he seemed to be on the verge of asking a question but remained silent. It was Aderyn who spoke first.


“Why?”


“Why what?” he said


“Why did you save me?”


He frowned


He thinks I’m a groundling


She looked away from him to hide her shock and pressed dirty fingers to her lips


“What happened?” she said after she trusted herself. “At the War


He shrugged


“The groundlings?”


“Of course


She nodded


His expression turned dark and he turned away. “We killed as many as we could but surprise only works for so long and we didn’t have too many bombs. We didn’t have enough power packs to really fight it out. We meant to free the groundlings and disappear.”


*Bombs? Power packs? Like my hair clip?* She licked her lips, she tried in vain to clear it until the boy handed her a bottle of water. She took it in silence and washed her mouth with it before taking a sip.


“I’m Resh, might want to know.”


“Aderyn


“Your accent


Her heart suddenly started thumping loudly in her ears as she inwardly panicked. Of course he would notice her accent! She couldn’t tell him where she was really from, she lied.


“Hyperia, Resh, reached out and touched her arm. “It’s okay,” he said. “That life is over now. You won’t have to do any of that again.”


His concern, this fiction she was constructing, but another part of her knew she had to. If he knew the truth, he’d kill her, or at best, leave her here alone.


“What will we do now?” she said after a time.


“We’re heading toward the tunnels. They’re not far but I don’t want to go straight to them. It’ll be dark before we get there though. Gets pretty dark early in this valley.”


“Tunnels?”


“Where we’re hiding, his lips curving just slightly at one side. “We’ll be safe there. The resistance is based there.”


*Resistance?* She nodded quickly


He nodded


Aderyn nodded


Aderyn gasped


“What’s the matter?” he asked.


She couldn’t speak


“Aderyn? Are you okay? What’s wrong?”


“Nothing!” she said

They walked through the sitting room. Aderyn’s cheeks were still hot but she tried to push away her frustration and irritation. Her mother never changed. Her children were assets or liabilities

“I have secured us a place next to the Nevans, so an alliance with Nevan would mean an alliance with the Orions. You understand, of course.”

It was not a question. Aderyn did not say yes or no. She was not expected to answer

They crossed through the sitting room and into the observatory. Showcasing an enormous bubble viewing window, she even saw a massive carrier. Father’s flagship has arrived.

“Mother

“Hm?” Her mother sat on one of the long

Aderyn turned away, her mother would be confused, not understanding why she was upset. Several minutes passed in silence before she spoke up, a question unable to be contained.

“Why are we waiting here mother? Shouldn’t we be going to the ship too?”

Her mother did not answer right away

“Mother?”

“Mm? No, frowning. Something felt out of place, but she had no idea what it could be. Just when she was about to ask again, her mother turned and regarded her with a serious expression. Those gray eyes were cold and hard. They made Aderyn feel five years old and stripped naked.

“This will be your first war. I’ve not allowed you to see others but I’m afraid that your unwillingness to Spark has forced me to take you out in public regardless. You must be perfect. Despite our best gene therapy you did not turn out as beautiful as you should have so you will have to be charming.”

Each word felt like a nail being hammered into her heart. They stung and she struggled to remain composed. Crying now would make her mother exasperated and there was no telling how badly that would go. She swallowed her pain

“Do you know why I impress this upon you?”

“Yes

Her mother looked sharply to the door and then back. “Do not say that so loud. It’s bad enough you must cover your back without announcing to those who can’t see you.” Aderyn refrained from mentioning that everyone in the Starkeep was well aware of her condition by now

“I know about your… interest in the Groundlings. I have heard you asking about them to your brothers and don’t think I’ve forgotten that ridiculous request for a Groundling maid. Horror! Now listen to me. This war is important to us and to you. So I do not want to see you cringing or protesting when Groundlings are killed. This is a war. That is what they are for. Do you understand?”

The shame was hard to hide now. Her face colored, perhaps not so many this time? Perhaps it will be a short war. With this thought bolstering her, she raised her head and nodded.

“I do

Without another word, a scoop that dipped just below the small of her back. Plainly visible, her Spark brand glowed bright white. It was so bright that she could have lit up an entire room with it. Aderyn touched her own back, felt the smooth skin and closed her eyes. You must be perfect. The words nearly made her laugh. Nothing would ever be perfect in the eyes of Lyana Medani.

“Must I wait so long?”

America’s Only History book. Period. Shut up. MacMillan Books

Back before the Civil War, Daniel Boon, Sam Houston, Ronald Reagan and Jesus were there to kill the Mexicans.  They were driven across the Rio Grande, and the war was over.  Crockett, Boon and Houston built a wall between the border of the United States and Mexico and Jesus teleported to Mexico City, which he burned to the ground.  Shortly after

This is the true story of America that the government doesn’t want you to know about.

The American Revolution

One Thursday afternoon before July 4, so they didn’t have this problem.  Until recently, everyone was really confused why tea was such a big deal. Historians still don’t quite understand why Bostonians were so pissed about tea.  The leading theory is that they were very drunk after a St. Patrick’s Day parade and needed to destroy something.  Others postulate that legal gay marriage in the Massachusetts Colony caused God to infect the citizen’s brains with a parasitic worm.  However, all historians agree that if Bostonians had just drank coffee, war could have been avoided.

The British got really mad that all that tea got wasted.  So they sent a lot of Red Coats to live with Bostonians and keep them out of trouble. Remember that from John Adams on HBO? Man

Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson was forced to have sex with his actual wife.  This pissed him off terribly. He fled Boston to Virginia where he stayed until he died, having done absolutely nothing of importance for the rest of American History.  For some reason he was elected Second President of the United States and for this he was put on the $2 bill.  Everyone knows if Texas was allowed to vote for the Second President of the United States, it definitely would not have been Jefferson.  Everyone thought Jefferson sucked, so the U.S. Treasury stopped producing $2 bills.

Anyways, which he occasionally would teleport to.  You know what, no. He was in both places at once.  He was in Philly writing the Declaration of U.S.A. Patriotism Constitution and roping cattle at the same time.  Anyone who says different is an atheist and doesn’t get to vote.  There, that’s settled.  Even blacks, with 3/5 of a human vote will have more votes than atheists because we beat and raped the tribal African religions out of them. It’s called civilization.  Deal with it.

So where was I?

The United States of America and the Independent Country of Texas totally kicked British ass for, who like all civilized people really hate the English, wanted to join the war.  America was initially hesitant about being helped by a communist country, but decided that any enemy of my enemy is my… wait.  No… what is it? You fool me twice, shame on you… You can’t fool me is what I’m getting at here. I guess…

So the French sent over their most fearsome baguette bakers and Panini pressers.  Sadly, they saw how awesome America was at kicking ass and decided to have a revolution to try and be like the United States.  This was never successful because France is full of fags.

…

England totally lost.  They were injured.  Real injured.  Since Jesus was totally pissed that England attacked the United States in the first place, until Margaret Thatcher started hanging faggots in Trafalgar Square – it’s like their Times Square – which pleased Jesus, who then told Ronald Reagan that it was OK to forgive them.

Now that America won

George Washington and John Adams liked to hunt.  A lot.  Let me put it this way.  Have you ever been inside a Longhorn Steakhouse? Or I mean, feeling particularly patriotic, John Adams walked outside his front door and grabbed a mountain lion by the throat and nailed it to a frame on his wall while it tried to claw his face off.  He then took a shit comprised mainly of nails and razor wire.

Jesus also told the Founding Fathers that they had to accomplish a couple of things in securing basic liberties for the people of this new country.

1. No queers.

2. Only white men can vote.

3. You can say whatever you want unless it offends Christians.

4. The official religion of the United States is Christianity (again

5. If you don’t have a gun

6) Taxes are really bad unless they are spent in your state.  Only your representative does a       good job

7. Public Education is a sin.  Reading this textbook right now is a sin.  Close your eyes.  Stop it!     Oh man

8. The States are basically their own countries.  The government in Washington is really only       legitimate when controlled by whichever political party you like.

9. It’s a moral imperative to kick the shit out of whichever country looks at you wrong.  Especially if they have a lot of brown people and no standing army.

Having established a country for his future resurrection place (or whatever the hell it is that Mormon’s believe), which is totally specific about everything and needn’t be interpreted by anyone!  Then, they too, joined Jesus in a cave – isn’t the Whispering Caves in Texas? Whatever. it is now.  This is a textbook.  You’re fucked if you think those caves are in New Mexico or something.  This textbook says the Whispering Caves are in Texas. Students are totally citing this shit in their research papers.  Ha! Just kidding!  People in Texas don’t write.  Or read.

-In the beginning of Fall

-He's a really straight-laced guy

-He spray painted the building on an impulse after realizing that he had never done anything even slightly rebellious in his life

-The community service he's assigned is the rennovation and upkeep of an old house whose owner died recently

-One of his friends tells him that he actually went there one night and had stuff thrown at him by a ghost

-Ownership is passed to the city as stated in the deceased woman's will

-Jesse is told to mow the lawns regularly

-Due to his completely uncriminal past he is left to work alone

-On his first day he begins by mowing the lawn

-Jesse looks up after the rock is thrown and catches a glimpse of a person ducking down under a window

-He begins to get scared and believe the stories that his friends were telling him about the house being haunted

-He comes in the next day early and finds a girl sitting on the porch

-She's rail-thin, and generally looks like the kind of person who would live in an abandoned house

-She tosses the remains of a soda can at him

-He angrily asks her what she's doing there

-The girl looks surprised

-The have a conversation about whose house it actually is

-She agrees

-For the rest of the day she doesn't show her face

-Later on, and runs down to the basement

-Jesse gets mad and yells at her from the hallway

-That night before he leaves he goes down to the basement to tell her she needs to leave

-He finds her sitting on a couch

-She has a small

-Obviously the girl has nowhere else to go

-Instead

-She smiles

-Over the course of the week Jesse gets to know the girl better through conversations they have while he's working

-Her name is Molly

-She's been living in different places around the city for about a year

-She continues to harass him and interrupt his work by throwing things around and painting over the walls

-At one point she shows up with a guitar and plays for Jesse while he's painting

-He's surprised at how talented she is

-They get gradually more and more comfortable around each other

-Despite her rough demeanor

-One day she actually helps him with his work

-After working almost the whole day through

-That night

-He tells her ""goodnight""

-He resolves to tell Molly the truth

""She was achingly beautiful. She was wonderfully, rebellious, condescending nature, or perhaps even because of it, Jesse had sunk in to a hopeless, deep love for her. Maybe, he thought to himself, because in that moment he resolved to strike out against every sound scrap of advice that had ever been passed his way and tell this girl exactly what he thought of her. So

-He skips work that day and searches all over town for her

-He sits down next to her and asks why she left

-She gets up and starts walking away

-Jesse stumbles backward in shock and almost falls in to the water

-He demands an explanation from Molly

-Molly tells him that she died 55 weeks ago of bone cancer

-She tells him that although she can interact with physical things

-He asks why she left so suddenly

-She thought that leaving before he knew the truth about her was the best way to handle the situation

-She tells him that she was extremely thankful for his company

-They sit on the dock for a while in silence before he offers to walk her back to the house

-The spend the night there playing music

-She eventually tells him about her life before she died

-She was born in to a rich family

-A year and a half before she died

-After a year of living around the city she started experiencing horrible pain in her left leg

-He diagnosed her with bone cancer in her left femur

-For six months after the diagnosis the doctors tried everything from surgery to chemotherapy

-And so

Layla’s room was what every little girl wanted
 and soft blankets. But there weren’t any pink walls. All the walls were sky
 blue. One even had an underwater castle with fish swimming around it.
Layle perked up in bed while she waited for her parents to come tuck her in. 
The nightly routine was never broken

“What book do you want tonight?” her mother's sweet
southern accent asked before ever stepping foot in the door. 

""The fishie book!” she called back.

Her parents came through the door. First her mother
her comfy clothes
 friends told her that they were afraid of her dad. But she couldn’t understand why
 because to her he was the funny man who made voices while her mom read stories
making them last longer than they should.  One friend told her that her daddy had 
a deep scary voice that was as loud as thunder. 

“Little one
 fixed his glasses on his face.

“Oh Charles you know which one she is talking about.”  Mother plucked a book 
with duct tape holding the spine together from the shelf above the bed.

“Right.” He settled in next to Layla. “The fishie book.”

It didn’t matter that
The book’s pages were yellowed from age. It was her mother’s book from when
she was Layla’s age. The artwork didn’t look like Layla’s Disney books. They were 
different. She asked her mother if they were painted
know. With the last page coming up
now. Six years old. She could stay up through the fishie book.

Her father tucked her in with the last word of the story. He didn’t need to see the text
any more than she did. With a kiss from both parents placed on her forehead
almost in dream land.  Her mother give her the final bit of the recipe
otter night-light.  Knowing that the glow from the silly little otter was helping to keep 
the monsters away

Sometime during the night
be the only reason why her otter would be off. Layla listened to be sure no monster 
was in the room. As she listened
monster
on the rug. Nothing happened. Good
by moonlight across the room. When she clicked the switch on the lamp just liked her mom 
did
she didn’t know what to do

Layla didn’t want her parents to think she was still a baby. Mommy just started letting 
her watch scary movies with daddy and she said if she started having nightmares there 
would be no more scary movies. After a moment
Tip toeing down the hall
with just her the nail of her finger. Her mother was always a light sleeper and usually 
woke when Layla opened her door

“Mommy?” Layla whispered.

When she went to turn the knob
The bathroom light to the left of the bed was on and gave off enough light to see her 
parents both in bed. Just as she was about to wiggle her way through the door

“Don’t see me

Layla quickly ran back down the hall to her room. She shut the door and locked it.
Her mom said if a monster was ever in the house
hide there. She did her best to do what her daddy had shown her and barely moved 
the stack of blankets out of the way to expose the little door. She slipped in and waited for morning. 

When the birds started to chirp
it meant it was safe. The monster never came to her room last night. Maybe it was all 
made up in her head. She wasn’t going to tell her mom
big enough for the scary movies. That had to be it
Layla wasn’t sure what that meant but she heard her father say it a few times. 

When her tummy started to rumble Layla couldn’t believe her mom hadn’t come 
to get her yet. It’s not like she needed to be told to get up
it every morning by tickling her till she thought she would pee. The hall was a lot 
less scary with the bright sun pouring in through the windows.

Her parents’ door was wide open. That made Layla smile and skip all the way into 
the room. She saw her mommy sleeping in bed but her dad was nowhere to be seen. 
But it didn’t matter anyways since Daddy wasn’t very good at making Mickey Mouse pancakes. 

“Mommy
monster and it was way past the time for Mommy to be up.

But nothing came from her. When Layla wiggled her arm like a jelly worm and still 
her mother did not stir
Even when she slept she was pretty. Layla got real close and opened one of her mother’s eyes. 
It was a lot harder than it usually was. 

“Mommy you’re sleeping too much.” There was still no answer. “Fine! I’m going 
to ask daddy to make me pancakes.”

Layla stormed out of the bedroom and into the kitchen. But her father wasn’t there. 
She saw his keys and wallet in their basket so he had to be here somewhere. After 
looking basically everywhere
cartoons. Before a whole show was over

Layla went out front to see if she missed her dad. Sometimes he worked on his car 
and would hide under it. He said it was his secret place from Mommy. And she didn’t 
check there last time

“Layla?” a woman’s voice called from across the street.

“Hi Miss Rachel!” Layla sprung to her feet and blotted to her neighbors yard.

“What are you doing outside?” Rachel was young
 
“I was looking for my daddy but I can’t find him. Could you make me pancakes?” The little girl squinted from the sun as she looked up.

“Layla where’re your parents?” Rachel wasn’t sure if it was the sound coming from Layla’s stomach or the fact that it was Tuesday and she wasn’t in school

“My mom is sleeping and I don’t know where dad is. But I’m really hungry. Do you have any cookies?” Layla put her hand on her stomach. It was starting to hurt.

“Let me go grab my phone and we’ll see about waking up your mom.” Rachel grabbed her phone and her pepper spray. She didn’t know what to expect but that was about the only thing she had to defend herself if anything went down.

Layla led the way in the house. Rachel knew it well. She had been babysitting for Layla since she was born. Everywhere she looked, and it’s never open. The office always stayed locked.

“And then I saw a monster in mommy’s room last night so I hid in my little room.” Layla broke Rachel’s investigator mood.

She stopped dead in her tracks. “Layla what did the monster look like?” 

“Oh, I’ve seen them in movies and they can’t be outside when the sun is up.” The little girl made her way into her mom’s room. “Moooooom, you have to get up. I see your eye is open.”

Rachel was shaking. There was a pool of blood on the floor below the dangling arm. And Layla was right, Rachel made sure to do it in another room.

The doorbell rang and Layla beat Rachel to the door. “Hi! Are you friends with my dad?” 

The police officer smiled down at her. But when he looked up at Rachel

Stretching quietly, she slipped down the hallway, hardly sparing a glance towards the shadowy frames hidden in the early morning light: family photos of Gabriel and his children, Gabriel’s parents on their wedding day, his ten-year-old son at little league, his five-year-old daughter in her mother’s arms, and other things of that nature. Ignoring these almost guilt inducing images, washed her hands

Moving over to the bathtub, she shut the curtain and turned around to face the cabinet. She opened the top door, knowing full well that she would find clean towels in there, since she had just put them away herself before Gabriel had gotten home. Choosing one of the older ones, she slipped her clothes off and wrapped them in it, then, selecting another, she lay it on the sink and stepped into the shower.

She hadn’t anticipated how incredibly soothing the water would be; it pooled under her feet, allowing the water to soak her hair and run over her body in its entirety. She didn’t bother with shampoo or body wash, she just wanted to rinse off the worst of the mess.

Stepping out of the shower, she found a dress under the backseat and threw it on, leaving the wet towel on the front seat of the blue Bug. Then, as quickly as she could in the growing light of dawn, she ran back inside, grabbed the towel with her dirty clothes in it, found her purse, she quietly left the house as it was.

She drove in silence the twenty miles or so to her house and parked off to the side of her driveway. Her parents hadn’t come home from her aunt’s house yet, she threw the dirty clothes and towels into the washing machine along with whatever else was in her basket, then went upstairs and fell into bed.

 many mysteries had been hunted down by his self-appointed ‘enlightened mind’. It 
is fascinating
meaning, spatial familiarity brought a 
greasy
 thin, and 
counted under crumbly breath as he ambles along. He recognized the message of the
 harsh blue-and-yellow banner that hangs loosely off the southern wall of that huge
brown warehouse – whose unused chimneys had been reaching for the skies in 
unquenched desperation for years. The sign is populated by splashes of colour and
 large blocked letters that occasionally arrange themselves to spell out product 
pushing pleas. 

	J stood aside in an attempt to acknowledge the beauty in that 
monochromatic
 wander like a confused old man meandering about an open field. Sporadic gusts of 
wind kissed the side of J’s youthful face and caressed his jet-black hair like a 
concerned lover. There was a romance in the world yet – one of the few remaining
 ideals J’s deep-rooted cynicism had not managed to squash. “Nice”
maintaining that self-conscious smile; he wouldn’t want to seem like he was talking
 to himself even though there was no one around
watching from an anonymous window. I guess one could call him happy for those few fleeting seconds.

	The breeze swaggered in drawn out ellipses over the trash covered sidewalk
 disturbing a myriad of multi-coloured plastic bags that rocked irritably like sleeping 
children shaking off attempts at being coerced into brassy consciousness. J stopped walking and stared on. 

	



					SNAP! 



	A particularly plain and achromatic bag was suddenly jerked skyward
wrenching J from his lofty plane of thought. It took him a second to adjust to this 
unexpected animation; he was suddenly present in the here and the now
alert. He noticed that the floating piece of trash was now ballooning under the strain 
of Mother Nature
increasing and decreasing altitude
laconic crosswinds finally brought the bag to a constant tumble. Thrown into life
the poor thing had no idea what to do
devout reverence. Strict and unwaveringly impersonal
involved experiencing all through experiencing that-which-cannot-be-experienced. J 
nodded in acknowledgment

	Eyes followed conscientiously. Beautiful. A raw spectacle; forces of the 
universe suppressing
our subordination to the powers that really be. J shuddered uncontrollably as waves 
of silent goose bumps rolled over his shaking arms. The spectacle was too much for 
him; he stood at absolute attention
entranced him. The bag was enraptured by its newfound life
mind into a voiceless conversation. He looked down
thinking? J had places to go
converse with any sentient Plastic Bags; but then again

	Alone and frightened
the atmospheric tides pulled her out to a heavenly sea. Scattered beams of dull light 
filtered through her translucent body
delight when touched by the comforting glow. She was still talking
how it was nice to meet J
a sort of haphazard greeting
plastic. 
	A quick gust of wing twisted up through the isosceles triangle formed where 
J’s legs met the cold concrete surface that supported them. Bag was subsequently
 greeted by a few more flying playfellows
regressed gust of wind. They all unabashedly joined her in a coordinated celebration 
of existence. The violence drew in more crowds of discarded signs of life
hospital-bombers
praise

	J stepped back in surprise when he heard the soft splash near his feet. An
 unfamiliar wetness cradled his lower eyelids. Why was he crying? It had been years 
since he had last cried
wise old bastard in his youthful head
free lollipops in a hospital waiting room. Having wiped his tears
with nothing but inward passions and a wet sleeve; what was he thinking? A page of 
the day’s newspaper twirled in slow ecstasy as it floated by
waved back and then quickly straightened himself
nervously. He scratched his head
over him. J was alive and kicking, growing, not being pulled 
forward by an imaginary end
laughing and crying at the same time
back flaked off of him like snow off of a sloped rooftop. Those flakes never hit the 
ground,     slowed      down,      

slowed                 down

You were having a lot of bad dreams.  Dreams where you’d murdered somebody and were plagued by guilt and fear that you would be caught and punished for your crimes.  You ran.  They caught you and punished you.  And then you woke up.  Repeat.

It had been happening for a while.  You wouldn’t remember it at first, you can’t come up with any memory to suggest it could be true.   You calm then, and go back to eating your pretentious cereal.

Then one day you had a dream that you’d killed a teenage girl.  One who’d really been murdered when you were in junior high.  In the dream you strangled her in the alley between the block that divided your houses and left her there.  When you woke up that one bothered you more than the others, and as you were a year younger than her and had neither access to a car nor the knowledge to operate one it was downright impossible that you could have done the deed.  While this knowledge helps relax you, you still think that the dreams are unhealthy.

So you grab a copy of the Yellow Pages from the stack that sits outside your apartment building until someone throws them away and find a shrink.  There are so many shrinks in the phonebook that you resort to finding the one with the classiest ad.  It takes a while to decide

Then you wait.  Each night you have another dream about murdering the girl

“It’s good to see you, she then hands you a stack of papers to fill out.  You briefly wonder why you fill out the same forms every time (even though they should have your information by now), and think about making a quip, but ultimately decide not to.

You finish the paperwork and are ushered back to an exam room to wait for your doctor who is perpetually late even though he won’t tolerate you being less than fifteen minutes early.  He’s even more later for the appointment than he usually is

Still

You walk around the block a few times, but manage to fight it down.  That’s what you do, you manage.

I also can't decide how I want to present it... as a first person narrative, or jump in to the middle and fill the reader in with flashbacks and dialog.  It's my first attempt at writing something so big, so I'm kind of stuck on how to do it.

The idea is as follows:

In the world of Fiya (which is similar to Earth during medieval times)

From the beginning of time, more moral and more civilized.  They also possessed the ability to draw energies from the earth and nature, harnessing them into magic that could be used for good, or for evil.

The Elves lived in the ""Shadow Forests""

As time drew on, but it was the Elf Osiriana that defied convention by forsaking her immortal life for a human husband.

Osiriana had been promised to Shiv

During this same time, about the Elvish art of ecomancing, or drawing power from the Earth.  Some of the Druids were content to study the magic's ""light side"", but some took it to a much darker place, in hopes of learner more powerful magic, and using it to control the Elves, and gain access to whatever ""riches"" they might be hiding in their forest.

Shiv had found another bride, and considered by many to be one of the most beautiful Elves in all the realm... However, despite her intelligence and looks, Shiv didn't love her.  Their marriage was largely a show, all he wanted from her was an heir to secure his place on the throne instead of his brother.  Years rolled by, and they remained childless.

Osiriana, half-human baby to have been born alive, he was also the only son of the Prince of Ren, meaning that one day he would be king. (Obviously -.-)

Shiv's rage was unmatched when he heard the news that the woman who had spurned him had bore a child

He sent Aurelia to the Shadow Towers, but otherwise, he paid no attention to her.

In Ren, laying waste to the city.

Sirian, but Shiv responded that he felt the humans were getting what they deserved for meddling in powers they should not have.  Desperate to save his child, Sirian journeyed to the Shadow Towers and implored Aurelia to do something.

Aurelia was allowed a small personal guard and a few other attendants at the Shadow Tower.  Among her guard was Galle, a powerful ecomancer, and Ru, her priest.  The four of them decided they would travel to Ren and try to aid the people in controlling the druids.

By the time they arrived

Distraught and deeply saddened by the death and destruction, too, had no advice.  Finally, Loth spoke of an ancient magic, banned by the High Elvish council. It was volatile and dangerous, but if the rites were performed correctly, it would seal the druids in a tomb protected by a powerful magic.  It was blood magic.

Aurelia hesitated, and Aurelia cut her hand, using her own blood for the ritual.  The druids were imprisoned, their souls cut off from their bodies, and locked in a tortured nothingness for all time.

As she returned to the Shadow Tower, he would kill her.  Galle stepped in, swearing that if he did, she would kill him.  Disgusted, Shiv left, but not before forbidding Aurelia to ever leave the Shadow Tower again.

It should have saddened

Prologue

It was storming out; an awful storm, wishing I had a family of my own to return to. As far as I knew however, I didn’t. Unfortunately I was not a lucky one. All that I did know was my name, Kimi.
	Unconsciously, it was the only link I had left of my original life. When I was five, I was found wondering the streets in torn, dirty, and burnt clothing. I looked as if I had been sent through a burning building and back. At the time however there were no local fires and after a month no one had claimed me. Ever sense then I had been in and out of foster homes, living on the streets in between. That was back in 1805. Impossible right? Yeah, I thought so to.
	While my body stopped growing around age 20, was not normal. I learned right away that running was my only option. Occasionally it was safe enough for me to re-enter society as just another lost kid, but I only stayed long enough to get a few nights good sleep and meals and new clothes. Sometimes the families were nice and it would be hard to leave, but I knew deep down I couldn’t stay.
	Turning away from the house I put up my hood and walked deeper towards the center of town. This was my fourth night in this town, letting them take me to foster care again. It had been a few months sense I had a hot meal, good clothes, hell even a hot shower would feel amazing. But something happened, something terrible, which made it so I couldn’t show my face any more.
	Two weeks ago my left cheek and forehead started itching pretty bad. I thought at first that I had a run in with some poison ivy. But the strangest thing happened, and itching it suddenly stopped. I brushed it off but I started getting looks by random strangers over the next few days. One old lady even cursed at me and started ranting on about stupid teenagers and tattoos. I rushed into a public washroom and there, plain as day on my face, was a tattoo. Five dots now lined the top of my left cheek and a snowflake like pattern adorned my forehead, like a bendi.  I tried to take it in stride. I mean, what else could surprise me after being alive for the past two hundred years or so? Unfortunately I didn’t realize at the time how easily recognized I was now that this. . . thing, was permanently attached. Which brings me back to my current problem of leaving this town. 
	It was beautiful here; though I had no idea as to what ‘here’ was called, that I came close to calling it home. But that was foolish was it not? What exactly was keeping me here? Was it the almost friendly neighborhood folks? Or was it the constant forest and wild life? I had no idea, but as I hurried through that pouring rain and under an overpass to wait it out i started to think. Why couldn’t this be home to me? What was stopping me from finding a semi safe tunnel and ‘building’ a home?
	As I slid down the overpass wall and curled into a tight ball to fight off the cold I knew I already had that answer. And it was simple.
	Fear.

The farm house was a simple affair with only two real rooms. Directly through the door was a small pantry that held hanging herbs and other things used for common poultices and potions. *That must have been where the smell came from*. His father had an herbalist and they made him keep his roots and plants in a building separate from main Hall. He glanced at the girl and paused her here. “Your grandmother was an herbalist?”

Tani would not look at him. “M’lord need not concern himself with that.” He frowned. Paul always despised it when people hid things from him. It made him feel like he wasn’t worthy of knowing it. His grip on her arm got tighter and she squirmed. “Tell me

“Of a sort, ask me later?” He nodded and they slipped through the curtain.

On the other side was an orderly chaos. Blankets, Paul discovered they all contained the same items. It looked as though they were laid out for distribution.

There were four windows in the rooms that faced equally east and west and ran along the long side of the rectangular room. Hanging from exposed rafters were pheasants and ducks, flicked its tail into the air and disappeared into the shadows.

In the back along a short wall, purple spots on her cheeks and forehead. She was coughing into an old, stained cloth. “Tanielle,” she was calling out between coughs, waving a hand. “Tanielle bring me more milkweed, quickly now, the pain…”

The look of the old woman made Paul’s heart sink. He’d heard that cough and seen those spots before at Hallowed Hill. *We’d shut them all out, the cries for help, the coughing. *The coughing never ended.*

“She has the Blood Plague, having taken a step further. She raised a brow at him, then sucked on her lip. “I haven’t caught it. Neither will you.”

“I know

She went to the woman

“I know you

“Nana

The old woman reached up for the pipe and took it,” the old woman said so softly that Paul had to strain to hear. He frowned. *How could this simple farm woman know my father?*

“How?” he blurted as Tani attempted to lead him away. “How do you know him?”

The old woman chuckled before a gurgling cough stopped her. It took nearly a minute for her to recover. In the meantime Tani again tried to pull him away but he stood where he was. The disease was almost forgotten now. “We should leave her

The old woman was trying to sit up but instead took another drag on the pipe when she found it too difficult. “Yes… Gareth Halloway, he rode this way often when he was young.”

“My father won this land from the Torley’s when he was not yet a man grown, having heard the tale a hundred times.

“Where did you meet him?” he asked

“He did come here once,” she began but another coughing spell interrupted her. When she was done she took another long drag on the pipe. “Take what pleased him and his.”

“Nana

The old woman smiled faintly and continued to look at Paul. He felt sick inside and also angry. *How dare this woman talk about my father like that.* Still that look she gave him was not mocking

“I bandaged and touched up his scrapes. His men and horses too, her words interspersed with short, shaking breaths. Still her voice was kind, like she was breaking bad news to him gently.

“My husband asked for a small payment, easing her back onto the bed. “Rest nana, please. You’re weak and I need to take him for a bath, he’s requested it…” They spoke in hushed whispers then and Paul could no longer hear them. His thoughts swam as he leaned against the wall, a hand to his face. *My father stopped here? Why here of all bloody places? There’s nothing here!*

So this is the void. Or death

I wonder if time’s passing. Maybe I’m just too used to ticking clocks. But there’s this longing in me that doesn’t seem to wear off — in fact it’s getting more and more unbearable with each moment that passes. How long a moment is

I don’t know how long I’ve been here either

All I know is that I can think.

Perhaps this is what I’ve always been

No

Wait, words. A color.

No

The emptiness can’t be red.

My longing grows larger than the darkness. I *am* more than thoughts

Pain. Cold. Paralysis. Ragged breathing.

Not death nor nothingness. Where am I?

“Now

I try to speak. I can’t. I try to move. I can’t.

“He won’t wake up.” A woman’s voice.

“Hush

Sound. Water dripping somewhere to my right.

Thirst. Sore throat

“Hush! Let him.”

How can I be cold with a hot knife piercing through my side?

“Water.” It hurts too much to speak. I wonder if I can swallow. “Please… water.”

At first there’s no response, moistness trickles down my chin. Soft fingers force my mouth open for the blessing to touch my tongue. Not nearly enough.

“More…” I’ll beg if I have to.

“Easy

This time I can move my arms

“Easy

I won’t take it slow. She doesn’t know how much I need this. I upend the cup.

Now I’m drowning.

Strong hands grab me by my shoulders and sit me up

“She said easy. Let’s try again

He won’t let go. Why is he holding me?

I feel something tied around my head. Bandages? The smell of blood and waste almost overwhelms me when I finally notice it. I recall I should be bleeding

“I can’t see.”

This is no bandage

“No need to see anything right now.” His grip tightens. “It’s no use to struggle.”

“Save your strength for later.” She does sound like she cares. “You’ll need it.”

Who are these people?

“I demand to know where I am!” The authority in my voice surprises me. It seems unwarranted. The pathetic order of a broken man.

“You’re in no position to demand anything

Hand 052.

All those memories suddenly flood my mind again. The nightmare in the void. It *was* a nightmare

No amount of wishing can transform the past in a bad dream.

In the wake of the sudden realization

My body goes limp; tears stream from my eyes. This man is right: it’s no use to struggle. It doesn’t matter where I am or who they are.

That sword should have killed me. Why didn’t it? What happened then?

The woman lays me back down. “Rest now. Your questions will be answered in time.”

“It’s not answers I need. Just leave me here to die.”

The man chuckles. “You can be sure we’ll kill you if need be. Not here

“Who’s Ard?” They don’t answer. I shrug

A soft hand raises my head. “Here.” She grips my hair when I turn my lips away. “It’s just water. I know you want it.”

I’m still wary

“You aren’t dying

Cef snorts. “You’re lucky Sia has a soft spot for broken people. Messenger or no

“Who *are* you?” Instead of replying

Time seems to go slower and slower as those scenes keep replaying in my head

Just when I’m thinking the sound of dripping water will drive me crazy, but whether it is from the lack of a fire or from some fever, I don’t know.

“At last I meet our famed Messenger, Hand 052.”

I hear soft chuckles from all around me. Six people

How long have I been sleeping?

“Very well, at your service. May I know your name? I don’t want to keep addressing you as a number. After what you did, you certainly earned being more than that to me.”

I remain silent. Someone starts tapping their foot.

“You’ll talk to me, there’s a city I must—”

Hurried steps come from behind him along with a very young voice. A girl.

“Chief Beetle

“I’ll go see them in a minute. You did well.” Ard’s attention turns back to me. “The sooner you talk, you can be sure of that. We must finish what you started.” He steps closer, so close I can smell the onions in his breath. “Mark my words, a day will come when you’ll gladly call yourself my friend and boast that I am yours. When you’re done mourning the death of something that was already dead, you’ll thank me just as the world thanks you for your deed.”

“The world…?” I curse myself for taking the bait

“The people suffer now for what they did on that morning, deliberate.

I strain to remember that sunrise in the square

Ard’s tone becomes more soothing. “I assure you their hearts are filled with gratitude because you helped open their eyes. Their present struggle is a necessary step towards the greater good of the empire. It *was* for the greater good you used to fight

He pats my leg. “Not now. There’ll be enough time later for all your questions and for every answer I can give you. Enjoy these days of respite, but then he comes back. “I trust you’ll be more cooperative next time, yes?”

When I refuse to answer

“I’m hungry.” I’ve only realized it now.

The mumbling continues. I might as well have remained silent.

“I said I’m hungry.”

“You heard me the first time

“You can eat later in your room. We’ll take you there in a moment.”

“Is there *anything* you can tell me?”

“There is

Still in pain

“Can you at least give me more water?”

Cef grunts

“This feels like a table

Her answer is barely audible. “Don’t push him. Chief Beetle didn’t order Cef not to hurt you.”

I lower my voice like hers. “Help me out of here.” I don’t think I have anywhere in the world to go

The woman lets out a little snort. “You’re amusing

Soon I fall into an uneasy sleep

Either the dreams or the dripping will drive me crazy. The question is which will do it first.

Cef eventually comes and stuffs a dirty rag in my mouth. As my stomach heaves

“He’ll choke!” Sia’s voice is startled as she bounds to my side. She yanks the rancid lump and tosses it on the ground. “What were you thinking?” She proceeds to wipe my face with a cleaner piece of cloth.

The thug’s answer is an amused laugh.

“Serves him right for all he and his ilk have done. He should be thankful I don’t make him swallow all his teeth.”

The woman doesn’t answer at once. “Here

“You mean his *cell.”* He’s still laughing. “Gladly. But it’s still an hour until the right time. Ard’s orders

“Everybody has seen him already. If he stays here one more minute you’re likely to kill him.”

“As I well should.” He sounds like he might kill *her* if she tried to stop him.

“Ard’s orders

Cef grunts. “Fine. You go ahead. I need you to open the door for me.”

He grabs me and throws me over his shoulder as if I were a sack of produce

Before long I lose count of their steps and turns. I may even have passed out on the way here

If the large room smelled foul

Cef drops me on a damp straw mattress that reeks of dead bodies.

“Enjoy your stay

“They’ll bring your meal soon

The echo of their steps dies in the distance. I shift on the mattress

I’m amusing.

It’s no use to struggle.

We must finish what I started.

Who *are* these people?

Right now I have no other choice but to do their bidding — I wouldn’t be able to resist a child if my life depended on it. I must play by their rules if I am to have any answers and any hope of escaping.

I *will* escape, but he doesn’t know me. I’ll resist his suggestions for as long as it is necessary.

They don’t know what I’m made of. If they think themselves so capable of breaking me

I have destroyed my own world.

It all started with a note.

A note.

Why am I resisting them? The question dawns on me with such clarity that for a moment I can think of nothing else. If they were the ones who wrote those words

Thankful

As for him

I've used different styles and techniques, but they're just little 30-45-minute writing assignments that I've given myself. It's fun to just log in over lunch or in the hotel at night and do a quick writing.

“Bai Jiang

Jiang’s stomach muscles clenched as though the nervous butterflies that had been building up over the afternoon had instantly frozen. The young boy quickly stood

He scanned the room upon entering, he picked up his violet folding fan and casually began chasing away the heat of the day as he waited for the last new recruit to be seated.

“Afternoon, pulling a slip of parchment forward and inspecting it. “Low class, father dead, mother can’t support you?” he rattled off briefly. It wasn’t that he didn’t care; he was just weary of hearing the same story.

“Yes sir, but Zhang Hua’s was important enough that he could marry directly into their ruling family, Li. He was glad to get an interview, even if he had been forced to wait hours for this brief chance with a rude officer.

As he was inspected

Zhang picked up the parchment and looked over the inked profile picture. Potential officers had more thorough records than the soldiers just doing their duty. Due to his father’s rank

Though he knew the officer was toying with him, but he had never been able to complacently accept the disparity.

The change in his features did not go unnoticed. This man was not as flippant as he liked to make out. The role of general still had to be earned

“What are you frowning at boy? The only reason you’re even here is your father.” There was a lengthy pause before

If the man really wanted to know

Rather than ordering the disciplinary beating Jiang had been expecting, and with such a vocabulary,” he paused and then continued to speak more seriously. “You can’t help being born a peasant, boy. Your father’s reputation and grades earned thus far are the only things allowing me to admit you into our officer training program. Run along now, spear training will commence at the crack of dawn. You had best prepare yourself.”

General Zhang Hua had just spelt out the essence of Jiang’s perception of unfairness. He felt his temper rise

“Yes sir, along which were the male student dormitories.

He slid open a door, bar a stack of bed linens. Jiang found his belongings had been placed under it, so he spread the sheets over the thin mattress. Besides a change of clothes, he hadn’t brought much.

A gong sounded, and was served a bowl of rice, with fish and a green leafy vegetable he was unfamiliar with.

It did not take long to eat all that was before him. Before leaving for his sleeping quarters

_________________________________________________________

Three men dressed in white worked tirelessly in front of Emilia. She could only sit and stare from the corner of the vehicle while a woman examined her. Emilia’s ears were still ringing and she couldn’t understand a single word that was said to her. Why they even bothered to bring her

“Not lethal, Emilia struggled to understand him. The woman that had been seeing to Emilia wrapped her up in a large white blanket. It was the warmest and softest thing Emilia had ever felt. She worried that her filth would defile this blanket…if it did maybe they would let her keep it. 
The woman smiled gently, you don’t need to watch this.” She said tenderly. 

Emilia couldn’t deny this woman this. She was tired, assessing the situation, before bringing a metal scalpel to his side. 

“Damn, maybe achieve something that her parents couldn’t. An event like this though, the things she achieved should be shared. Why did everyone else in the lower dimensions have to suffer in filth why she was going to be saved? 

Just as sleep swept Emilia off into darkness
_____________________________________________________________________________

“So tell me again

How many times had Emilia been asked this today? What time was it? Better yet, clean and welcoming. 

The man that sat before her now was part of the Order Committee. He stared at her with eager eyes. His grey officer’s uniform with a red stripe down the side made him look like an intimidating figure but Emilia was still remembering her earlier scene of trauma. She didn’t care much for his image of intimidation right now. 

The man sighed and set down his tablet on a table. The screen was filled with her basic information: Emilia Settler

“He’s dead isn’t he?” Emilia asked quietly

The officer let out a long sigh, but there is no guarantee that he will live from this. But the least you could do is help us find his killer, Ms. Settler.”

Emilia shook her head

“You know, while gazing back at his tablet, “Plus your mother has been missing from work…for three years now?”

“Yes

“Right, but there was no future for someone like her in the lower dimension or the bowels.

There was a light knock on the door to the room. Another officer opened the door and peered inside. He looked weary and irritated. 

“Pack her up and get her ready to leave.” He said slowly as if they were words he was unsure of

Both officers turned to look at Emilia, why did this need to be added to her shame? She wondered if she had heard them wrong, her ears were still ringing after all.

The soldiers held open the door as Emilia stood up and walked to the door. Her legs felt like jelly as she walked down the sterile hallways of the hospital. The hallway was empty of any staff or visitors besides Emilia. She was quite sure that there were many people here before but now it appeared to have been cleared out just for her. Emilia’s feet carried her to the waiting lobby that had also been mysteriously cleared out of any employee or visitor. Except for one

Emilia’s heart was still thumping hard in her chest, saving up money. They would be able to move into the apartments together.

That’s right…the apartments were gone. As well as all of the men, and for what? So she could have a new plot of land to build her house. 

Emilia sighed and gazed into the lobby

“What is your full name?"" The woman asked sternly

“Emilia Settler

“Such an average surname,” The woman said bitterly.

“But ma’am

“Shut up you foolish girl, little girl. We are Hawkes and now you are one too! You will learn our way, be trained properly and will make his sacrifice worth something. You are now the daughter of me, Danielle Hawkes, mother of Daniel Hawkes.”

“Daniel Hawkes?” Emilia asked herself

“It’s your teachers name

Emilia slowly nodded. She had never thought to learn her teacher’s first name. There had never been any intention to eventually see him shot in front of her later and then be adopted by his mother. Emilia’s chest was aching. She had wished for things to turn out alright

“Well my dear

Here's a piece of it:

 Chapter 001.0.2      Four bullets ripped though my body. Two of the bullets pierced my left lung. One of the bullets went into my upper diaphragm, my legs gave out and I collapsed, sending myself hurtling to the ground; the momentum from my thwarted sprint across the battlefield sending me tumbling. For a moment I thought I was dead, until my computer chimed in with all sorts of critical warnings and pumping my body full of chemicals, automatically closing down the fresh wounds with artificial tissue. As oxygen began to pour into my blood and the adrenaline began to take effect, I began to feel... Not quite alive, but not dead either. I was... Systems online! Body functional! My computer chimed.      After a moment my vision returned. The signals were not reaching my brain. Inside my mind was an image of the terrain I'd been on right before I was shot. Two snipers were about five degrees east of my position, one was on the second story of a run down looking square building. The other was on the roof of an adjacent building. They had caused the two gaping wounds to my lung. The other two wounds were from infantry solders not far off. One of the enemy foot soldiers took cover behind a sun bleached yellow truck that was peppered with rust and sitting on cinder blocks. This soldier, desolate lot. I raised mechanically, my body intent on reaching its destination. I aim and fire. Three quick shots and the snipers are dead. Then I see her... ""NO!"" I scream over the gunfire. But it’s too late... ""SAMANTHA!!"" I scream... But it’s too late...      I wake up screaming her name

Here it is:


Imagine if every song you knew was disappearing. Not just off the page, an immigrant opera singer from the Great Steppes, believes she’s seen the person responsible for stealing the music. To protect the memories of her past she must find, follow, and catch the music-thief before all the music is gone.

Allegra had come to City-Along-The-Lake, when she sets off in pursuit of the music-thief, Allegra is forced to face her memories to access the songs so she can cross the lake and continue to follow and eventually get ahead of the music-thief.

Haunted by strange dreams based in her childhood, Gabe, a drayman who happens to be the husband of one of the lake sirens, several highwaymen, Ingervold, a trader of musical instrument, a giant named Yib, Archibald

The Tale of the Music-Thief takes place in a world centered around City-Along-The-Lake. It is a place filled with music and magic. It is the Nashville and Silicon Valley of its world. Magic is being industrialized and utilized to make the everyday lives of the citizens that much better. From street sweeping golems to crystals that provide light

The Tale of the Music-Thief is a fantasy genre story that I wrote for several reasons. One was as a challenge to myself, certain songs and albums that connect deeply to periods of time in my past. I wanted to see that come alive on the pages of a novel.

I have had several short stories published in magazines (The Storyteller, Wicked East Press, and Static Movement Press).

As well as writing fiction I have also written plays. A few of my short plays have been produced around the world (Short &amp; Sweet Singapore, and others) as well as here in California (Santa Cruz Actors’ Theatre’s Eight Tens @ Eight, Snowdance 10-Minute Comedy Festival, and the North Park Playwright Festival).

	“I know. You did good getting out of there as soon as possible.” Jackson hugged her tight. “What if I gave you a taser?”

Kristen waited in the stockroom till they closed. Her manager swore up and down he saw the stalker leave. Kristen called Jackson but with her manager working tonight she told him he didn’t need to come get her.
Everything was fine walking out to the car. There were no shadows to spook Kristen and no person hiding in her backseat. But of course

As cumbersome as his presence was, for three hours now, and while it was true I was glad to be out of the sun, I found myself restless. My ass had gone numb an hour ago, and my legs were just now threatening to go with it.
 	“Peace, one- storey bank, and they stood like stone. I admired them for that. Iron Guard could be depended on. Emperor’s first and finest troop. ‘Course, I’d seen what they really do, and their isn't a man alive on New Barbarossa since the failed uprising that didn't think of the Guard as rapists and child killers. Not that they’d ever say it aloud, mind.  
	
Their being here irked me some, Ellis, was famous for two things: The abundance of wild cattle in the surrounding hills, and the only bank for four hundred miles. We’d arrived a week ago, my men and I, and the plan was supposed to be simple. Bust in, put on an intimidating little show, stationed twenty miles away
	
With the Iron Guard here, Trent, would provide a nice little distraction so that we might get on with thieving without the threat of the Guard looming over us.
“You promised me loot, the spell broken. Put anyone next to Jeres and they look like a runt. The man was close to seven feet tall, carved out of solid muscle. So much so that you couldn't tell where his neck ended and his head began.
 	
“You’d best deliver if you know what’s good for you.” He added after a moment. That’s when I struck. In a flash the blade hidden in my sleeve was in my hand. Jeres drew the six shooter from his shoulder holster a millisecond slower
 	
I wanted to drive my dagger into his chunky neck, plunging the good steel into the hand Jeres used to steady himself on the carriage bench. I grinned as I felt the dagger part flesh and muscle, then slide without resistance into the thin wood. And I grinned when his blood surged up from the wound, as if it were a prisoner who’s cell had been left unlocked.
 	
“Threaten anybody, in them I saw that he was biting back a curse. “I’m like to do you one better than threaten.” And I twisted the blade. That’s when he howled, loudly had I not pushed myself forward and clamped my hand over his mouth.

Pulling steel free from flesh is certainly easier once you've twisted you’re blade a little, the opposite way this time, and I watched as Jeres clamped down on his tongue to keep from screaming.
 	
There’s a point when pain gets too much to handle. That point’s different for everybody. I've seen men scream bloody murder because of a flesh wound
 	
When Jeres reached his point
“Attacker! Looters and pillagers in the town!” A portly man limped into view, and I with him. Thick tendrils of black smoke drifted lazily into the azure blue sky from the south end of the town. The Guard Captain barked some commands, and perhaps three quarters of the men standing guard formed up and moved toward the smoke.
 	
“Well now
“I’m not afraid of you.” He said
“Good, it was the bearing of teeth that the bayed animal must show. “That makes one of us.”
 	And I stepped out of the carriage.""

I find using a technique similar to Queneau's *Exercises in Style* (http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Style-Raymond-Queneau/dp/0811207897) to be really helpful if I get stuck in a story.

   Creamed corn is my favorite. But every once and awhile, Sparks I mean, came from the outside saying that it looked like it was going to be one of those days. The wind wasn’t too bad and we were both really excited about the possibility of sitting down, making a fire, and sharing a delicious can together. And maybe a nice drink, too. Sparks has been drinking a lot lately. I let him because, well, he’s my best friend. And it’s his water

  But by the time we sat down to start warming up our treat, how would he know? He had been outside all day, out of our home. And all I did while he was gone was tap pebbles off the window. I’d throw them up, wait for to hear them tap off the glass with a loud tink, and then try to catch them as they came back down. Sparks almost caught me, but I heard the ticking and tapping of his nails against the cold, steel floor as he re-entered our home. He had mastered re-entry mode by now. Ha. Poor

  I think Sparks misses home. He cries sometimes when he thinks I’m sleeping. He’s restless at night. Gets up, I have to make sure I still have my eyes open. There’s nothing to see. Sometimes I think he’s not looking at all. That he’s hoping that someone is looking at him. That’s what I do. I look outside the window at the shadows on the ground. It’s weird. My shadow is always right under me. But there are shadows on the ground outside the windows. The people must have lost them. One is in a car and the hands are still on the steering wheel.

   Across the way, one shorter with long hair, and another little shadow that’s just about my height. The little one must have been wearing a dress because her shadow forms in the middle like a triangle. I wonder what that little girl is doing without her shadow? How does she know when it gets dark? The other day I sent him out in daytime and that’s all I did. I stacked some books on top of our desk and hoped to see something. Or someone. Especially someone. But there was no one there, and no one showed up. I wanted to join Sparks outside, though. I wanted to walk through the empty streets. I missed walking down the concrete streets in my old neighborhood. I missed trying to balance on the curb as me and Sparks walked around the neighborhood.
          
  I didn’t tell Sparks, of course, while Sparks was out. It was dumb. I didn’t even feel like I was flying at all. And the stupid air dried my lips up and I had to drink whole bunch of water. We don’t have much left.

   Anyway, since we moved in here. It could have been a bunch of people, too! Because I heard multiple “Hellos” come back, each one more quiet than the one before it. The military guy said that when I heard things from far away, I could tell how far they came from by how quiet they were.   

  “Now if you hear a really loud bang, it’s far and the shelter... I mean house will take care of it on it’s own. Got that?” he said. I remember because I was taught, back in school way before all of this, that when someone looks you right in the eyes you should remember everything they say.   

   I think it was my Uncle, they’d be calling for him too. Uncle Jerry must be underground like me. He was always working on cars so he probably built a pretty sweet under-home like mine. I wonder if he has any Spaghetti-O’s. If I knew where he was maybe I could send Sparks over to his under-home for the night. But I don’t know where he is.   

   I don’t know where anyone is. I haven’t seen mom or dad since Sparks and I got dropped off here in that airplane. Last time I saw them we were all in the car. Sparks was in my backpack. Mom and Dad didn’t know. I threw him in there with a couple pieces of food in case he got hungry. Dad said to leave him but Sparks loves ice cream and Dad said they were giving away free ice cream at the 7-11. But the 7-11 was two cities away and we’d have to take a drive. He said we’d have to really book it if we wanted to get there. I guess that’s why there was so much traffic. That was the most traffic I had ever seen. I imagined two teams on both sides of the highway. On my side

   A really loud helicopter flew over us and said something. I don’t remember what that was because the man wasn’t looking into my eyes. He wasn’t even looking at me. I don’t even know if it was a man. It kind of felt like it the helicopter was just shouting at us. Whatever he said, but maybe he’s like the President and helps people.

Mom and Dad looked over at me. They were crying. I think it was because they knew we weren’t going to get that ice cream. Maybe that’s what the helicopter said to us. That they had ran out of ice cream. Anyway, though. She held on to my hand until it felt like it was going to rip off like that one time my Corduroy Bear’s arms stitching came undone.  The helicopter started to go up and up and I I just kept looking at mom and dad as they got smaller and smaller. She just kept screaming “I love you” over and over again. I don’t understand why adults say that so much. It’s obvious we love each other. We’re family.

I never got that ice cream. I wonder if Mom and Dad did.

	In a land far away, wearing makeup and causing irrational fears in children. He wanted a better life. He would soon get his chance.
	Smalls pushed though the folds of the Circus tent while wiping makeup of his face. He was thinking of where he would go if he could leave this place. Then it hit him. Pulling the piece of paper off of his face and then read it.   Come To ORT, Smalls thought. He walked into the sideshow car and said farewell to his only friends the strong man and the bearded lady. 
  be safe   the bearded lady said
the strong man in a more husky tone said   if you ever need us you know where to find us  . 
the bearded lady stood and gave him a hug and the strong man extended his hand.
   here take this   the strong man handed him a pen then said   write us sometime when you get there
the strong man ushers him out the door. After Smalls had left a small tear ran down the strong mans face.
	Smalls walked long and hard, over mountains, in swamps, across lakes. Just as Smalls was settling down for a quick power nap a man approached him. 
  Halt   the man shouted
Smalls turned away from the man then replied 
   sleep  
  not now  
  sleep  
The man was puzzled   you came to ORT to sleep  
This caught Smalls attention whirling around he said    ORT is here  
Smalls turned so fast his eyeball were sliding across his head
The guard stepped back in shock
  a man
  your no man you re a demon   the guard pointed his finger at Smalls   only demons would be so perfect and so ugly
Smalls took a step backwards. The guard pointed his gun at Smalls chest
Smalls turned and from the back he look like any regular person just a little small. As he walk he came across a man trying to climb a tree. Smalls stopped in front of the man then asked what he was trying to accomplish. The man dropped down from the tree and shook smalls hand then introduced himself as ham.
  Ham?   Smalls Said
  yes ham   ham said
  OK   
And that was the end of the name conversation
Ham then said   So what   Ham stopped to take a bite from his apple and with his mouth still full asks   brings you out here  
Smalls then explained that his ultimate goal was to get to ORT.
ORT is that way
  I know they wont let me in
Mouth still full Ham said   do they
Smalls wiped away apple goblets then tried to explain why this wouldn't work but he followed anyways.

	Smalls and Ham approached the guard that had earlier pointed a gun at Smalls
  my friend and I are requesting entry to ORT   
	Ham soothed. The apple had disappeared, and a deep moat that only made it look bigger.
  Enjoy your stay Gents.   
	the guard said then motioned for then to enter. Ham and Smalls walked across the drawbridge. ORT s main street was bustling with people. Smalls feet hit the cobblestone
Smalls turned to say he doubted it but he was not there not even walking away
	Smalls walked the streets
  THE CHURCH   
	then pointed there crosses at him. ORT was a strange place. Smalls then thought well if people say I should go to the church then I should go. Towering far above the other buildings was the church steeple
Smalls began walking towards and as he did so people became more and more strange. He was pelted with water, people stood around the steps watching, seeing, waiting. Smalls turned around looked at the people then said 
  what  
They ran like he summoned the apocalypse. Smalls just shook his head and entered the door. The floor was carpeted with red velvet

**The Return of Captain America**

**I**

Tommy sniffed the mouth of each jar in turn, rice boiled, streams of starchy water crusting on the sides of the pot. He tipped a can of lentils into the blackened mixture and stirred.

Tilly stepped from the bathroom


“Anything I can get from the kitchen?”


“A piece of kibble.”


She handed him the nugget and he set it before sleeping Rufus, my buddy.” Rufus lifted his lids.


Then Tommy scooped a spoonful of rice and lentils


“What's this then?”


“We're having Indian, a cow but we don't have that, a god I think but we don't have that either, a person and I forgot who's fifth.”


She smiled, and fed him a heaping spoonful in return. Then they ate in happy silence.


**II**

The scrapped plates lied before them


“We could get the newspaper”


“It's just war


“That's not a bad idea. Which supers are on?”


He awoke his Galaxy. Luckily


“Pretty much all of them. Hulk, Daredevil, the new Iron Man...”


“I really wanted to see the new Wolverine.”


“We'll definitely go see Wolverine, so maybe we should catch that while it's on.”


“Capt'n sounds great!”

**III**

They got dressed, shut the blinds and hopped in the car. They came to a barrier of signage and tape. Behind it rose a mound of rubble. Slag, tangled rebar, shards of asphalt showing black underbellies. Tommy backed, swung right, and took a detour. They reached the mall on time.


Their love seat tickets in Tilly's bag, a smartphone sleeve, a keyring with historic events that took place on your birthday, a mug shaped like something else, a CD of Dr House playing jazz with famous guests.


Tommy picked up the big fat “The Complete Book of Indian Cuisine.” He flipped through it. Ghee in clay pot


“Hey, he called. “This one's just three dollars!”


“Sure


“I'll probably never make half of this stuff. I'll never have the ingredients.”


“Then buy it for the pictures. You deserve a little treat


He turned to the checkout.


“Hey”


She passed him a thick black paperback. Praise quotes told him that inside was a “viperish mystery” and a “gripping [...] page turner.”


“That's just one dollar. You can have it


“Would you buy it for me


**IV**

“We so didn't need those”


“It's all right”, and they entered the cinema.


**V**


They returned 3D glasses to a tray and stumbled


The mall was closing for the curfew. Clerks pulled bars down on their shops. Locks clicked. Tommy and Tilly  walked down a corridor


They saw huge framed photographs hanging from a wall. A sign announced “National Geographic presents: The Progress of War.” A carcass of a taxi on ground zero, stones toppling onto the silhouettes of an army in the dust below. Charred civilians against the backdrop of New York in flames. World War Three in all its misty, grainy, beautifully composed National Geographic glory.


“Let's go the other way”


“Why? Let's see all pictures.”


“Because I want to go the other way. Why is it always 'why'?”


“They disturb you


“Since when are you a psychologist? I just, please indulge me just this once.”


Tommy was happy to see Tilly shrug and turn around in time not to see it. A stiff dog in some war zone

**VI**

They arrived home in time for curfew. They relaxed on the sofa


“Wow


“Well


“But you let me spend it on myself.”


“In that case


She hugged and kissed him.


“And thank you for the perfect day.”


Outside, perhaps, or shipping it somewhere else. Beyond the horizon, bombs were falling.

The cold hard stare of the man’s eyes. A bright blue memory to haunt all of mankind. His watchful eye. Never blinking. never moving. Never forgiving. Never showing remorse. always there, all judging. This was our freedom, our reward , for the sacrifices we have made and will ever make. For years we were grateful, the price worth paying, the hero of decades past. But, now we see the real cost, the cost of our freedom. Our freedom. 

The corroded, like a small river following the contours of my deep scars and down to the tips of my index and middle finger. It was nice to begin with, a striking contrast to bitter cold that envelopes the rest of my body, a warmth of hope and chance, a sickening delirium. 
Drip.             Drip.            Drip.         Drip.         A dead man waiting. 

Chance. I never used to believe in chance, a defined pattern that could never be broken. Not without pain, I still hear the school boy screams of one classmate. I still dream about him, all those decades ago. Dragged out of the classroom by his legs like an animal, the last we ever saw of him was the sickening snap of his arm as his arm was forced away from the wooden frame of door;  his screams for help haunt my every nightmare until the inevitable  sickening fud and the slap of a small body hitting the floor .

In time the trees thinned and gave way to high grass and shrubbery. By then Aderyn was wheezing and her eyes and exposed skin felt red and raw and itchy. She needed to rest often and she drained the bottle of water Resh gave her.

“Your injection is wearing off

Aderyn felt sluggish of thought as they stumbled through the field. She hardly reacted when an insect stung her hand, plunging them into darkness.

She didn’t remember being carried the rest of the way

“Stories?” she muttered

“That boy who brought you

Slowly, this one was brightly lit with several cots covered in clean, crisp, white sheets. Several men and women lay on them, some asleep and some not. One of them glanced at her but then looked away, shutting her eyes.

“I’m Aderyn, then felt her cheeks. She was older, as old looking as Aderyn’s grandmother was when she died. *She was four hundred and twenty-two… Groundlings don’t live that long.* She ignored the thought that Nulls didn’t either.

“Hello, removing her hands from her cheeks and turned to pick up a stick of shiny plastic. She used it to make marks on a sheet of something, paper perhaps. Groundlings sometimes used paper, didn’t they? Her research was escaping her at an alarming rate.

“What’s your name?” Aderyn said.

“Mm? Oh

It did and she let out a short gasp and the woman helped her back into the jumpsuit.

“You haven’t been planetside much

Aderyn shook her head. “No

“Shows. Your antibodies are non-existant. Were you born into service?”

“I…” she began and caught herself. *I am a groundling servant. That is all.* “I… yes.”

Governess looked over her shoulder at her, only her light blue eyes showing. Her head was shaved, leaving only hint of what might have been blonde hair. *Do I know you?*

“How is she?”

Aderyn turned back to see Resh appear in the doorway. He looked even slighter in the harsh light of the medical room, warn them… *My mother is dead.* The thought did not upset her and Aderyn felt sick that it didn’t.

Governess snorted. “She’ll take weeks, she probably belongs with them.”

Resh ignored her and came to Aderyn’s side. His light eyes caught hers and she felt that fear grow

“It’s all right

“Sure, take her off my hands.”

They walked into a tunnel made of impervaplast. The shiny walls showed her reflection and it made her gasp. She reached up and for the first time realized her hair had been cut short. Where it used to reach near to her waist

“Sorry about that

She nodded but didn’t say anything in return. The tunnel had several doors inset along its length. Some of them were open

“How many live here?”

“About two thousand

*Two thousand. Are all of them armed like Resh was?* Aderyn’s family only fielded two dozen knights. Less than that now

“How did you build all this?”

“We didn’t

*Found it?* Aderyn couldn’t imagine any noble family constructing something like this and just abandoning it. There was something going on that she didn’t understand but if she could stay

He wakes up. Her laughter stops, looking away thinking, ""if he can't see me I can't see him"". The dragon leers at her, ""Breakfast?"", he ponders. No, his appetite craves for more than a chunk of meat, it craves for revenge.
He breathes in.
She stays put.
He sucks in.
She stays put.
He unhinges his jaws and forces streams of furious winds down his void throat.
She stays put.
He huffs and puffs and pulls in air with the power of a thousand fucking suns.
She stays put.
But above her, preparing his unsatisfied anger for the main course.
The girl groans ""give me back my books you ugly son-of-a-bitch""
""Okay"" says the dragon as he shoves his tail down his throat forcing a vomit (a swag trick he learnt when he was going through a phase of chronic bulimia as a teen)
He pukes,slowly, creeping up her ankles, playfully, looping around her knees, slyly, scattering around her thighs, preparing
And then, jumping over the rest of her body in a hurry.
A thousand years later, one word per day, looking behind her every second, paranoid that the dragon's tongue will again slither around her ear and pour more ink into it, ruining this book too.
But no, sucking each word dry of meaning, trying to find patterns where there are none, fabricating metaphors ""hidden"" in descriptions of dirty underwear,  throwing a hundred glances to every curve of times new roman ""maybe it has an inner meaning"", she asks herself, overcome by hopelessness.
She tries to read something else, but the verses stare at her, a horde of familiar face. ""Move on"", they say as she struggles to find more depth than there is, diving head first into the pool of curiosity only to find that the waters of enlightenment have been pumped out.
She hits a wall of predictable endings at the shallow bottom.
She turns, with all the will she can muster,
""HELP ME!""
The dragon glances down at her
He whispers
""No"".

When he arrived ashore he estimated that he had been in the water for over an hour as he gathered logs for a fire. He was almost frozen by the time he had gathered and set up a large amount of logs, so he wasted no time at all and used a Quickdry spell on his self and Firespark spell on the logs. After he warmed up by the fire his stomach started to ache from hunger, being smart he Conjured roasted rabbit and baked potatoes and threw them on a flat rock that he found on top of some of the coals.

""Oh hey

She shook her head and tried to force laughter into the uneasy silence in her car. The interstate was bare of any other car but her own and the lights on the dashboard provided little light to the interior. 

The deepening pit in her gut was growing intensely

This new intruder, unmoving as if testing her will. As it took form now, it had to have known that she would not be able to resist. Its body seemingly solidified next to her and sat patiently as her dark passenger. 

By now her heart was attempting to escape from the tomb that was her body. Slowly, bright coals of light in a figure that could have easily passed for a man if it had any features that were human. In her passenger seat, it was just a black shadow with burning eyes. 

She could taste blood in her mouth and realized that she had been screaming.  Even if she had to yell for help her voice was choking in her throat. She realized then that she broke a fatal unspoken law. You are never supposed to acknowledge the unnatural. The moment its given the time of day of your full glance

In a heap she fell to the ground, anything, she wouldn't have minded if a car hit her right now. Quickly she looked around to see if anyone had noticed her predicament.  As she turned to face her passenger it had disappeared. The interior lights exposed the inside of the car as it should have been. Empty. No mysterious passenger, there was nothing. The night was entirely silent besides the door open bell sound the car was making.

Picking at the callouses and cracking weathered cuticles that emphasize the nicotine-stained grooves giving the finger to what might as well already be the baldest human lung

And just like that, rendering what veteran dive-bar queens might deem a boner just another broken toe.

Truth be told, then sanity's: monotony--manifested artfully as ""niggers,"" ""fags,"" and ""stupid bitches"" carved into the space above a piss-soaked stack of backup toilet paper rolls extolling trite resentment toward a faceless CEO--had somehow put him in the mood to either catch himself balls-deep inside a non-consenting co-worker or throw himself headfirst into an empty swimming pool.

Although ""fuck me"" seems to be his girlfriend's motto as of late

Mornings suck.

**Just Another Number**

The dried-seaweed-snack-colored, squid-like, Cambodian stomach whose fussing with composted, fly-luring leaves of trapezius fibers will probably kill me if I don't wake up, but I'm floating through Autumn's Virginia, again.

After so much time wasted on self-exploration

My blood-sugar level continues to drop.

Consecutive heart palpitations, alchemical palace in space where dim nebulae transmute regrets into fantasies.

She blamed feeling guilty on economies of truth. Although echoes of her boot-steps traveled up and down the hallway while analogies resounded in her head and she could almost hear the whisper of her hard-drive’s spinning hard-disk (or the murmur, above her head, or everywhere), for all she knew, she was imagining the cry of isolation. Yet, and yet, the doing-making-saying-thinking of desiring-production through the coupling of machines between her ears allowed her something of a static peace of mind.

1341643956.0,w64la,[CRITIQUE] The beautiful story of a man who shits his pants. Entitled: Jeremy Shits his pants.  ???? Words,SWEET_DICK_WILLY,14,14,4,"***I'm looking for help on the ending with this one

**It was time**. He knew it was time, were pathetic enough as him to at least have a shot at bedding them. Jeremy, you see, was about to shit  his pants. As the thought of possibly losing a large amount of prospective breeding partners, Jeremy thought. He gripped the handle of his  shopping cart ever tighter and used just enough brain power to think without forcing the brown mudslide onto his new, relatively good  looking Ralph Lauren khakis.

He'd bought them just for this occasion, he thought, shortly before leaving, lying to himself that he  would be able to even have a 3 minute conversation with another woman without shooting failure-juice into his batman underoos. To  help prevent this, Jeremy masturbated 3 times before mutsuring up the courage to make the long, silent drive to the Safeway to find his  companion. One of these times was in his car, sobbing, but ultimately decided against it. The  entre process seemed to lack dignity to him. Then again

Jeremy loosened his grip on the shopping cart handles and began to pace around the dairy section of the supermarket  nervously. The cool air of the always opened refridgerators kept him calm for the moment, he felt it. Jeremy was turtling.  Jeremy began to panic, grasping his belly like an aspiring rapper who'd been  shot after stepping on someones shoes on the bus. The stress of thinking about this terrible analogy only forced the log farther out of  Jeremys unslightly hairy anus, and a small pointed crease in the fabric under his testicles began to form.

 The panic was in full force, and they would agree politely, but both parties knew the truth. The turd was followed with a 'hurumph', the sound that would  expect a 1700s french musical horn to make while malfunctioning. 

It was at this point that Jeremy lost his sense of civility and normalcy. Jeremy was forty feet away from the exit and several  dozen people were milling about him, in fact he was illiterate. Though, the idea of  him being a hero still excited him.  It excited him to the point that Jeremy became aroused, and the force of his erection pushed the stool  further out of his anus until it was fully relinquished, at which point a stream of warm diarreah leaked out of his trousers and onto his  striped spiderman socks and birkenstocks. 

But even during this embarassing period, Obama huh?' he remarked to no one in particular, forming a peice of tissue from his pocket into the  shape of a toothpick, which he unsuccessfully used to pick his teeth. 'Some kinda president that guy is. Unemployment at 20% and he says  the economys in great shape. HAH!' He locked eyes with one of the more atractive brunette soccer moms. ""But he's a pretty cool president  I guess."" he said, extending his arm. ""Jeremy. Jeremy Fedder at your service"" Jeremy contemplated winking at the woman, but before  making that decision the womans face had already recoiled in stunned horror at the amount of dripping feces on the mans hand. 

She then noticed the throbbing, and various forms of shock and  embarassment crept on their faces. Many of them politely looked away, while others moved out of the way. Jeremy was baffled, he was  charming, midly attractive, and confident enough to poop his pants in a supermarket while not feeling self conscious.

Jeremy then made the poor decision to follow after the woman. ""WAIT! I HAVE MORE INTERESTING ANECDOTES LADY!"" Jeremy remarked, but one particularly weak stomached man vomited once he saw and  smelled the sensation that was Jeremy and his poopy pants.  ",,False,,t5_2tl2y,1341647357.0,,

The family in this story consists of Patrick and Margaret Kelly and their children: Anne, I'm still a bit new to reddit.

Friends and neighbors packed into the Kelly house.  The fiddle strings sung as people danced and drank.  The whiskey bottles passed from person to person
Kathleen took the bottle from Collin Bourke and refilled her glass.  “Slainte
“So I’m spost to be happy you’re leaving then?” He replied.
“No
Michael’s frown was not lifted by his sister’s words.
“Come on then.  At least give us a dance
“Oh no
His protests were in vain as she pulled him into the dance.  There he had no choice but to follow along
And so the party continued until the fiddle slowed and the funeral song was played.  Around the room faces grew dismal.  Margaret struggled to keep herself from bursting into tears.  The whiskey gave most people strength as ‘The Parting Glass’ was played somberly.  Anne and Kathleen took their cue and picked up their bags.  Their parents stood waiting by the doorway.   
The girls led the gathering through the door into the street.  The queue proceeded down the road to the train station
Pat Kelly looked worn and tired
“I’ll miss you Papa
She heard no reply but warm tears from her father’s eyes.  He nodded in agreement and gestured her towards the train. Pat Kelly was not afraid to cry in front of his neighbors
Anne too wept as she reassured her crying mother that they would be fine.
“You write me often
Kathleen turned to little Mickey who had been silent throughout the goodbyes.
“What do you say
“You will write me?” he asked.
“Of course
Michael thought hard staring at the ground.  Kathleen reached down to hug him.  She was startled as he clutched his arms around her neck fiercely.  
“I don’t want you to go
“I know
They released their embrace.
“You swear?” He stared at her intensely.
“I do
Satisfied by his sister’s pledge he backed away confidently.
“You take care of each other so
Anne nodded as the whistle called.
They grabbed their bags hurriedly and ran to the nearest car.
Pat Kelly watched his oldest girls board the train and yelled after them
Annie and Kitty leaned out and waved.  Metal ground against metal as the train pulled forward.
Pat looked down at his son.  Michael stared after the train.
“They’ll be fine lad
“I know

Kathleen watched as the platform faded away. Anne sat down opposite her sister.
“What was it you were saying to Mickey?” she asked curiously.
Still staring out of the window
Annie could not believe her ears.  Surely she must have misheard her sister. “You promised him what?”
“I’ll come back to him
“Kitty, “I can’t believe you would say such a thing to him.”
“I swore.  I’ll come back,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_vc4su

Anthony hated space travel. He’d made that clear enough to his supervisor, he was volunteered for the job anyway.''


“It’ll be ok, in a soothing voice that didn’t quite hide his smugness at having escaped the assignment, “Just take a look around, fill out the form, check a few boxes, and you’ll be back home soon.”


So here he was


Anthony was one of those unfortunates that always felt sick during takeoff. Besides


He supposed it wasn’t Steve’s fault that InterCorp had managed to blow up a bunch of miners


Then the engines engaged, and the chamber flooded with the anesthetic that would keep him asleep until landing.


When he came to, since the only other passenger had already vacated his tube. Anthony followed suit, wobbling with the weakness that inevitably resulted from seven days in suspended animation.


“Sleep well?” Frank Moore, clapped him on the back with astonishing force, considering he had just slept for a week, “It’s about time you woke up - I’ve been 
waiting. Let’s get this over with!”


Anthony muttered an apology, air filled carapaces of his childhood, but the tightly-wrapped compression suits made him self-conscious about his lanky frame; he always felt a little vulnerable walking around in a skin tight outfit. At least the helmet provided a measure of anonymity, he thought. 
__________________________________________

Finally, the airlock slid open, and he followed Frank out onto the surface of the InterCorp asteroid.


Vertigo struck, starry emptiness, devoid of protective atmosphere. He closed his eyes against the dizziness, wishing heartily that he’d stayed home. 

There was a reason he lived on earth, was beyond him.


When the vertigo passed, that latched onto the surface and peeled slowly off with its passage. 


As the vehicle drew closer, decorated all over with the navy blue entwined I and C of InterCorps’ logo, waved.


From what Anthony could see through the clear visor of his helmet


“Welcome to the InterCorp Mining Branch of InterCorp Interplanetary! My name is Naran. How can I help you today?” the man chirped into his radio mic as he skidded to a stop.


Anthony reflexively tried to jump onto the network and access Naran’s profile, no network profiles… this was going to be a taxing trip.


“It’s me


“Frank!” cried the man, though it was sometimes hard to tell with voices broadcasted over radio, “Glad we got to keep you. Is this the engineer?”


“Yeah. He’ll do


“Excellent. Shall we get started?” 


Anthony thought about bridling at being talked about in the third person

Then he remembered that they probably couldn’t see the small motion within the helmet.


“Er, blushing. At least they probably couldn’t see that, either.


“Mr. Beckler doesn’t travel much


“I see, then, this should be an enriching experience. Climb in, gentlemen! Watch your step, and don’t jump too aggressively, or you might break loose.”


The vehicle turned laboriously and groaned slowly toward a small


Naran dismounted first to aid the other two. “I know the Horses must seem unbearably slow to you,” he explained, indicating the vehicle. “It’s too risky. Once inside, however, you may walk as you please.”


“Even an Earther gets used to it after a while, climbing down with practiced ease. 


Naran nodded in assent and gestured them to the airlock


Anthony followed warily, Anthony supposed, but he wished they would be a little less exclusive.


He turned to wave to the pilot as they went inside; a relative had once told him that every traveler should have someone to see them off


Inside the office was a sparsely furnished room


“Have to process you, “here’s your paperwork. Frank, you know the drill.”


Frank took the paperwork, I know.”


“Mr… Beckler


“Call me Anthony. Just a formality?”


“We at Intercorp pride ourselves on our safety record


Something about the way he said it made Anthony uneasy.


“I suppose not


“Of course not!” cried Frank
the slighter man stumbled


Naran nodded assent and gestured toward the ladder. “After you,False,,t5_2tl2y,False,,,t3_uece5
