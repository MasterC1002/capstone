Before May 2010 he had the exact opposite opinion about hacking. In less than a year he's undergone a complete change in opinion, and appearance. He's hardly recognizable compared to who he once was. This young man has had his spirit and soul drained from him.

Watch this and pay close attention to his mannerisms. This is him pre-May 2010 in unreleased footage for a documentary about hackers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsyjQh03Xs&amp;t=5m54s

More interviews and documentary footage of Lamo from before his April run in with the police. Lamo in the Hackers Wanted documentary. He speaks eloquently and never loses focus of the subject matter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTYyltYi80

Here he is again in a Tech TV interview from 2003: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_SwtWu2HXk

Now he struggles to articulate himself, completely monotone, and has a scar above his left ear.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsSRaoOo2k

I think this is when they had something done to him

""In May 2010 Lamo reported his backpack stolen. The investigating officer noted unusual behavior by Lamo and detained him. He was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome after having been placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold

There are now reports that Bradley Manning also appears to be catatonic and having severe problems communicating. If they're doing this to Lamo what is keeping them from doing this to Bradley Manning? I'm thoroughly creeped out by all this.

**Below are more links to articles and video interviews about Lamo**

Interesting article picking up on this in November. http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-and-the-convenient-memories-of-adrian-lamo/

Lamo has worked for FBI or NSA

&gt; After that Lamo is a security specialist that the secret ""Project Vigilant"" worked for ( https: / / www.projectvigilant.us/ ). This project was Mark Rasch with donations from the business founded by. Quickly headed for nine years, the NSA (National Security Agency) for FISA activities (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) is responsible was observed and foreign intelligence agencies.

Some more footage on Lamo. I don't have time to go through it now

My question is essentially: How do you connect to the Internet when your whole country is disconnected? This would be a smart resource to have on hand if something ever went down (It's not like you can Google how to do it if you're already shutdown!).

**[EDIT]**

After spending some time on the Googles, and YouTubes it looks like access to the Internet from Egypt, Syria, and Libya  has been a hodgepodge of connection services offered by such fantastic groups like Telecomix and French Data Network. Essentially they ""devolved"" by using dial-up lines, HAM radio, etc. etc.

Tor has a few problems. The end server doesn't know who the client is


I've been researching how freenet works but I don't think a distributed hash is the answer. I'd like to keep the peer/seed dynamic of torrenting where one user has the file and other users download the file from that person; except instead of downloading directly from the user


Here's what I'm thinking now. I have a file. I yell out that I have access to the file and person A hears me. Person A yells out that he has access to the file and person B hears him. Person B yells out that he has access to the file and Person C hears him. C asks B for the file. B asks A for the file. A asks me for the file. I give the file to A who gives it to B who gives it C.


I'm the uploader. B and C don't even know I exist. A doesn't know if I'm the uploader or just another link in the chain. Likewise, they'll yell out a checksum. Unless our intermediary nodes look up the checksum, they never know what file the packets are from and can claim innocence. The people who want access to the file will download the checksum off a message board, much like torrent files are downloaded today.


What would be ideal is if the intermediary nodes had no idea what they passing along and had no way to look it up. In this system we've just developed, so they can easily update every 20min. Of course, this protection disappears if the  intermediary has access to the original checksum.

Essentially

They don't go into any details as to how this should happen

- setup a wide-open wifi router  
- plug the router into one of the NICs on my linux box  
- run tor on that box  
- configure iptables to traffic shape and route all traffic from that router that can go over tor into it

This seems like it would fulfill a number of desirable properties

- providing free wifi to the commons.  
- controlling how much bandwidth is consumed by free wifi users.  
- limiting my liability.  

There are a few things that this is not doing

- preventing free wifi users from playing stupid ARP tricks and sniffing on each others.  
- guaranteeing to free wifi users that I'm not sniffing the hell out of their traffic.  


So that's where I'm at. What do you guys think? Anything I'm missing

Also, so I could possibly setup everything on one router, and just plug that into my network. That also opens the possibility of distributing ready-to-use open wifi appliances. So that'd be neat, potentially.

Im sure you have heard of Bitcoin, and you dont have to sign up for anything (pseudonymous). This opens up a world of options for anonymous-micro-payments, and if you can use reddit, you can definitely use this.

So you maybe wondering what do sexPositive women have to do with bitcoin micro-payments? 

enter: **leChateau deCrypto** (/r/decrypto)

A venue for people interested in receiving bitcoins for their gonewild action. Patrons and admirers can digitally tip their favourite photos, then redditors can send bitcoins or parts of bitcoins(0.001) to other redditors to encourage photos or albums that they liked. These little tips add up, so tippers can tip with their tips.. and everything(woahdude).

Hopefully it wont stop here

What I am picturing is a Wiki that is resistant to take-downs by having all content automatically mirrored on darknet sites controlled by different entities. Content could be reachable from the site either by the human-readable URL like /dir/somedir/file.html

When the site receives a take-down request, so the content can be readily accessed with the hash URL, which retrieves it automatically from the darknet sites.  The take-down request would not be meaningful for the hash URLs since there is no storage of content on the clear site. It just acts as a proxy for the darknet sites.

Its design was introduced during [DEFCON 16](http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Brading) in 2008 - [design paper (PDF)](http://magnusbrading.com/phantom/phantom-design-paper.pdf)

**TL;DR:**

**IMO the cryptoanarchist solution of creating a free market with near-perfect competition will distribute value better than our inefficient current system.**

.

( . Y . )

I'm sure we agree that as of 2012 ""the system"" (of corporate plutocracy) doesn't work very well. It works worse for some than others (e.g. Foxconn employees.) But I think calling it a ""free market"" is a misnomer.

First off, and information among themselves.""

Further, are themselves determined by the market. [1] (So, basically, no external actors are interfering with the market.)

Here are a few examples of how external actors actually distort the world's markets as of 02.22.12. [2] These distortions tend to benefit someone

* States create barriers to entry by forcing corps to pay registration fees and file paperwork (see
* States impose a cost on using the market through periodic licensing and regulatory fees and paperwork 
* States attempt to impose a cost on all transactions through taxes
* States sets minimum wages (setting a price control on the price of labor)
* Central banks set interest rates (setting a price control on the price of ""borrowing money"")
* Central banks and governments print more money
* People who would like to participate in the market can be [forced to exit](http://tradehillblog.com/2012/02/13/tradehill-suspending-trading-and-returning-client-funds/) through threats of litigation

In my hypothetical free market

o.õ


**Cryptoanarchy** means

Imagine if the world's workers all download a linux live CD that, decreases transaction costs and minimizes barriers to entry. Using a [distributed internet](http://reddit.com/r/darknetplan) limits the risks of centralized information control.

Instantly

People digitally sign private contracts. Arbitration companies compete with the official legal system. Few people bother to file business registrations or taxes, on a global, online scale.

Eventually some hackers reverse engineer the iPhone and release open source plans for the OurPhone Ultimate. The hackers+makers of the world smell a profit opportunity and compete to manufacture and trade the various components that make up OurPhones. Others start corps that assemble components

Given a free market and enough time, will start with a lot of inertia because it's an economy of scale.

So now there's more jobs and more perfect market information. Workers can compare the wages offered by Foxconn with the wages offered by WoW powerlevelling contracts

The big benefit of market anarchy is that everyone participating gets to keep all of the value they generate. I don't know what percentage of the 99%'s income goes to the 1% through taxes

Cheers

[1] Interestingly

&gt; Note that the conditions for Perfect Competition mean that a perfect market cannot be unregulated

I think this is mistaken. Nothing stops hackers from forking someone's market and improving it to more closely approximate a perfect market. As long as traders have enough information to know what markets exist

Does the nature of distributed currency mean it's easier to enforce a monopoly of currency? 


People have for a long time talked specifically about bitcoin and if it ever rivalled actual currencies governments could dump huge numbers of nodes to disrupt and poison the swarm.

But this issue rears its head with competition realistically between digital-currencies. 

Many parties act to manipulate traditional currencies through markets and government policy to protect their reserves. In p2p digital-currencies larger swarms can directly poison smaller competing currency swarms relatively easy with their size. (For example the ability built into the software (e.g. a branch of bitcoin wallet)

The traditional currency manipulation normally has a papertrail with laws


So really I'm looking for thoughts on this matter :

Can a large digital currency enforce its monopoly
