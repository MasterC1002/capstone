1347772466.0,zykw2,Getting Out and What It Means To Me.,Wrongdonald,618,123,418,"So I've spent 4 of the past 5 years out of the US.  At first, meet a girl, because again

I got out for two years, a truly miserable experienced.  I ""got out"" to one of those countries that is so fucked up, it probably won't continue to be a country much longer.  I was poor, I was sick, I was scared.  I was alive.  

I spent a year in the US, I bought a dog (Duckie).  Then it started to drag, and it started to suck.  The dog died (parvo, which I didn't even know was a thing, until it was too late) and so did I.  I got out again.
  
I went to paradise and learned it wasn't all it's cracked up to be.  I found myself in one of the most naturally beautiful places this planet has conjured, because in 10 years, all its charm and beauty will have washed away.  I was poor, I was scared, and I hated the job that sponsored me.  
When I think about it now

At home, shiny white they paint on school and hospital walls that allows no humanity to spill or stain them.  Everything was either old and decrepit or new and hostile.  I saw a lot of pain and weariness in the eyes of my friends and family, especially those who lead the same life as when I got out for the first time.  

Still, and I could make it work.  Or at least, I tell myself that I could make it work.  That's a gamble that means all of your chips are on the hand that says your future happiness exists in Smalltown, USA.  That boasts, your future happiness is attainable, affordable easy, and all you have to do is sign right here.  I read the news, I realized that they probably resented their families.  If they hated their job and their families

I find myself in a new, vibrant and new.  I'm a child here, so it's filled with wonder.  I'm alive, wide-eyed and joyful.  

I got out to know myself.  It's the most profound and important advice anyone has ever given me and I consider myself cosmically fortunate it was given to me enough times to stick.  I saw that for me, I've returned smarter, healthier, with a deeper sense of spirit and purpose.  I avoided becoming a statistic by getting out.  

However, annoyances, inefficiencies or pointless bureaucracy.  There will be things you love and things you hate about any place you go, if you don't think that's true, you haven't been there long enough.  

For me, you're wasting everyone's time, including yours.  It's by Rolf Potts.) is such a popular way to get out:  you experience the hot, passionate romance of exploring a new place without the frustrating, dirty, or brutal sacrifices of a long-term relationship.  It's getting out as a summer fling, not as a serious relationship.  

The long-term is what I have left to discover.  I've yet to ""seduce"" a country into letting me stay there forever, I will appreciate my own home.  I will give the US another go, and from the sounds of a lot of these informational requests, many of you should do the same.  I still believe that you can lead any kind of life you want there, but it requires a great deal of sacrifice, effort and dedication.  Sounds a lot like the price of freedom, to me.  

If I do become a full-time expat, or spite.  It's because I'll dedicate my life and career to the search, to the road and to the wind.  It's because that's how I feel alive, when I am watching the world zip by through a window.  That window, on a bus, a plane, a train, or just out of the corner of my eye is how I want to live and die.  That's where my soul thrives

In closing, plague you and consume you.  Get out because you are passionate, curious, or excited to share yourself.  Get out because your comfort zone ends when you hand over a boarding pass.  Get out because that's when life puts you at your best.  Get out because getting out is the story you will tell your grandchildren.  Get out because the road beckons you in a way that you feel deeply, in a way that moons beckon wolves and the tides, or in a way that you know, while it will not always be easy, it was impossible to resist.  Get out because it gives your senses purpose, good and bad.  Get out

1303822189.0,gxqar,"I have gotten out, and out, and out (currently on my 4th country 8 years later) - a few tips",shinjirarehen,262,76, with no special help (financially or family connections

* Get a college degree! I am the first person to admit that the US has many many problems and fails at many things, and many countries have immigration requirements that make it much easier to get a visa if you have a degree (in anything), and for some it's nearly impossible without one. If you can get a master's even better! If you can study abroad for a year while getting your degree, do it - best way to learn the language and make connections in a new country, and make sure it's really for you.

* Take advantage of organized programs if you don't have many ties in another country yet. There are so many - Working Holiday (US citizens can work in NZ and Aus *super* easily, WOOFing, Fulbright and other fellowships, study abroad/exchange, volunteering/peace corps/etc. Having a structured way to start is a great first step and you'll be able to go on independently after that.

* Learn the language! If you're aiming for somewhere that doesn't speak your native language, what's important while job hunting is the language of local business. If you're up for a job against someone who has the language and you don't, you're going to miss out. Also, if you don't learn the language you're very likely to get stuck in an expat bubble in your new country. It's a huge challenge, but don't be lazy - do it!

* Do NOT mess around with laws, etc. Don't try to game the system. Don't sneak around. Yes, visas are one of the biggest headaches known to man. Yes, tax and legal systems can be amazingly complicated, especially in another country. But if you screw up, it will come back to haunt you. If you get caught trying to dodge getting a proper visa, it's likely you will get banned from the country you wanted so much to go to. If you lie to an employer about your visa status you are shooting yourself in the foot for future employment. Not worth it! Do your research and fulfil the visa requirements. Be realistic. Even if it takes a long time, walk the straight and narrow if you're serious about making a life in a new country.

* Don't underestimate culture shock. You will grow as a person and learn so much, can be deceptively challenging. Sometimes when things are superficially similar is actually a bigger shock because when you scratch the surface you find out things are subtly different in profound ways you never expected. Learn about the culture shock process and allow yourself to experience its ups and downs without getting frustrated at either yourself for not adapting or your new home for not being what you expected. It's all part of the experience! Also, don't be surprised when the novelty wears off and you find you've simply traded whatever problems you were escaping for a new set of problems and a change of scenery. There is a downside to every place, but learning about the world through your own experience is its own reward.

* Make the effort to keep up with people important to you, especially if you're moving around a lot and hard to catch. It's so easy to let important people slip away, but much as you may want to get out, there is simply no replacement for family and old friends. Something you only realize only after getting way way far away is how precious it is to have someone who understands your background implicitly (language, culture, etc) to talk to when things are rough or you need perspective. Just keep mind they may never fully understand your new experiences and don't hold it against them. The new people you meet are great sources of info, advice, but ended up becoming very important to me after life takes unexpected turns. Keep up your facebook

* Keep a US address, because it really comes in handy sometimes, and they are very hard to get back once you let them go if you're not physically there. Also, don't forget to vote absentee and file your US tax returns (even though you're likely not going to need to pay anything if you're not earning in the US). A huge benefit to being an ex-pat is having a foot in each world, so don't give up your US presence while building your new one overseas.

EDIT to add a big one I forgot to mention:

That's the problem with a lot of the posters here though. They're not aspiring expats

Living in another country is an exhilarating, **not an escape hatch**. To the potential posters of IWantOut, please know that if you're unhappy in your life now, you're going to be unhappy abroad as well. If you're broke here, you'll be broke there as well. 

Moving overseas doesn't immediately make you Julia Roberts in *Eat Pray Love*. That's not how it works. Your motivating factors in moving abroad ought to be internal rather than external. Get out because you need to live overseas to (experience my grandfather's country/learn Chinese/follow my love/etc) not because you're trying to escape your (bad job/debt/depression). 

The playful title of this subreddit does my cause no favours — but that's because I think those of us who live abroad can get a chuckle out of the idea that you just hold up the sign like the little reddior man in the logo and get out. We know facetiousness of that cartoon. Aspring expat do not.

###DISCLAIMER  
I worked as a legal assistant for an immigration lawyer in Canada so I'm fairly familiar with our immigration system

###IS CANADA A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE?  
It has its flaws (domestic and international travel is expensive if you're used to Europe, but overall yes. For the most part, Canada has:  

* Friendly
* The most diverse population of any country in the world (really!)
* Low crime (visitors are surprised that flower shops often leave all the flowers out overnight unprotected)
* High quality of life (good food
* Huge natural beauty and a love of the outdoors (more than almost anywhere else on earth)
* Acceptable labour laws (much better than America
* Excellent customer service (People who work in shops and restaurants

It's certainly not a perfect country, you should definitely visit first! Canada is the second-largest country on Earth, and cities/regions are extremely different from each other: Canada has deserts, cities, farming areas, rainforests, fishing villages, mountains

###HOW DO I IMMIGRATE TO CANADA?  
As is the case with almost every country on earth, you have no claim to Canadian residency. Step one is finding your local Canadian embassy/consulate/high commission, wherever you are. [This](http://www.international.gc.ca/ciw-cdm/embassies-ambassades.aspx?view=d) is the complete list of websites for Canadian foreign offices in every country that has one. Their staff and website will be of enormous assistance to you, and details (mostly about the third program) may vary depending on where you're from. They can help.

Without further ado

* As a [Temporary Foreign Worker](http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/workplaceskills/foreign_workers/index.shtml). Requires a job offer from a Canadian employer in advance. Unless your skills are in high demand or you have a strong international reputation for your work

* As a [Federal Skilled Worker](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/index.asp). There are three streams of this: PhD students studying in Canada, something Canada needs more of). Here's a 2010 version of [that list](http://www.visabureau.com/canada/priority-occupation-list.aspx). There's no current version available because applications are temporarily closed for the Priority Occupation category until some time in early 2013 when rules may be changing. For FSW applicants, they grade your application out of 100. Anyone who gets above a 67 is generally accepted, on a first-come, first-serve basis until quotas for each category are filled. Here's [a sample test](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp) that can help you estimate what grade out of 100 you'd score. It'll ask how many years of full-time experience you have in an occupation with NOC codes of 0, A or B. To work out what qualifies, find your job [here](http://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/noc/english/noc/2011/SearchAlphabetical.aspx) (there's a search box too, or the second digit is 0, you need at least one year of *full-time, take basic French lessons for a month.

* [International Experience Canada](http://www.international.gc.ca/experience/intro_incoming-intro_entrant.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d) (Working Holiday). Every year, no limits, for 12 months, and do not need an employment offer in advance - it's up to you to find work. **Applications will be opening within the next few weeks for 2013** and they are always filled quite quickly (within a few weeks/months). Each participating country is allocated a specific number of spaces per year  - check with your local Canadian foreign office for your country's info, or it should be on their website too. You may be able to reapply for further 12 month periods if you wish, but this is not guaranteed - speak with your Canadian embassy for details, as each participating country has different policies about reapplying.  

##Alternative: Study in Canada

* Canada also receives 1000s of international students every year. [This page](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/study-who.asp) has all the details about how to study in Canada. I won't get into what universities are good and bad, and cheap for international students compared to American or British schools (~$9,000-20,000 CAD per year for tuition). This is still quite expensive, which is why I don't list it as a standard method of coming to Canada. All you need is proof that you have been accepted to a Canadian educational institution, proof that you have enough money for school and living and return to your home after, no criminal record, and the website linked has details on that too. After graduating

###WHERE SHOULD I LIVE?
Canada is the second-largest country on Earth (after Russia). Although we are larger than the US

* Toronto: I'm from here and therefore biased. Largest city, over 100 libraries, great nightlife, lots of culture, busy city. 

* Montréal: Extremely beautiful island city in Québec

* Vancouver: Hosted 2010 Winter Olympics

* Ottawa: Our capital

* Calgary: Home to Canada's resource extraction industry, Calgary.)

* Halifax

*A note about language:* Canada has two official languages, but not necessarily both. Canadians use English in all areas of Canada except the province of Québec and some parts of the province of New Brunswick. (Outside of these areas, only 1 in 10 Canadians can have a conversation in French!) If you do not live in either of these places, English is normal and you will never need any French at all. 

###HOW DO I GET A JOB IN CANADA?
The answer to this varies depending on what job you're looking for, but most employers will want a résumé listing your past jobs/experience/education, and a cover letter - same as in the US. The letter should introduce yourself and explain why you think you would be good for that specific job, ending with information about how to contact you. If the job is minimum wage (retail/food/etc.), the tone of the letter should be professional but friendly - Canada is casual compared to Europe, but a little more formal than the US, if that helps. Job websites in Canada include www.monster.ca www.craigslist.ca and www.kijiji.ca but there are many more.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/

people tell me that living abroad is not the perfect life:

- you will have antisemitism (not like here were people are trying to kill you from left and right).
- you will not be able to save a dime (but at least i will be able to live a normal life) 
- your kid will never know what it is to be an Israeli (these days i think it is only a plus). in fact i don't feel like an Israeli any longer.

i can contribute to any IT company and will be a very valuable employee but i would appreciate anyone who is looking for an CTO or and IT Senior personal that will take the chance but will never regret it.

I’m always reading fascinating discussions on Reddit and other sites about what it’s like to live in different countries and cities around the world

I decided to build istorical.com to try to foster a community where you can find out everything you’d ever want to know about what it’s like to live in Barcelona, or wherever else you dream of. You can view and discuss videos, and read and post answers to questions about what the local people are like, the cost of living, things to do there, local culture, nightlife, unsafe areas

As of today,540 cities, 154 videos, and more than 95,000 questions begging to be answered. I’m building this alone, and it’s been extremely rewarding and educational, but also incredibly challenging for me to get even friends and acquaintances to post on the site. If you answered even a few questions about what life is like in your city or country, I would be incredibly grateful.

And of course

Thanks for reading

SECOND EDIT: Woo-hoo! Didn't get downvoted to oblivion!

New questions: 
What would it take for you to answer five questions about your city or the country you live in? Does it just seem too empty right now to be worth posting in?

And would you be annoyed if you were private messaged out of nowhere and asked if I could quote one of your comments from elsewhere on Reddit and post it as a new quotation-answer on istorical.com? With attribution and thanks to your reddit username and a link back to the comment on Reddit or your Reddit profile? The quote would be displayed right alongside the rest of the answers to a question but with huge quotation marks around it and the credit to you for writing the original comment or whatever.

I've been following this subreddit for quite a while, pros and cons, and advice for people who want to experience living in a foreign country.

---**Experiences**---

I'm an Italian in his mid-20s

1) **High School Exchange Student**. I was 17 at the time, the duration and how immersive it has been. At the time, facebook and skype weren't popular, so I had minimal contacts with the people back at home. Most of the english I know today comes from that experience.

2) **Erasmus Programme**. In my early 20s, and because of the awesome international environment created by this programme. I had friends and roommates from all over the world, and I'm still in contact with lots of them. I also had incredible vacations around the world, hosted by these friends. I didn't know any Spanish at all, but for an Italian, it's sort of cheating...

3) **Visiting Scholar for Thesis work**. All italian degrees require a thesis work, and I asked him if I could do my thesis work over there. He said yes and invited me over for a semester with a J-1 VISA. I didn't have to pay tuition and I also got a scholarship, which helped quite a bit. In general, I always had rent/tuition covered when I studied abroad.

---**Considerations about living abroad**---

I will list some positive and negative aspects about spending some time abroad. Those are purely subjective

**PROS**

- **Open-mindedness**: Staying abroad forces you to be in contact with people with very different backgrounds and outlook on what they expect from life. This kind of interaction had a huge impact on me, almost dogmatic, now I see a world a possibilities.

- **The possibility to reinvent yourself**: Have you ever thought how you would be if you were born in a different family, the power of the habit is so strong that it's actually very very hard to change things. Moving abroad can disrupt this routine, let you start all over again and, at least in my experience, set up a happier lifestyle. The bad part? Usually those bad habits waited for me back in my own country...

- **A world of friends**: Making strong frienships with people from all over the world is actually an awesome part of living abroad. I was able to visit so many countries because of friends hosting me, usually willing to show you how things truly are out of the touristic side of a certain place. Living in Italy also gives me the occasion to give back, which is also very cool.

**CONS**

- **You will always be a foreigner**: Wrap your mind around it, and they still act as italian as they never left the country. This fact is not necessarily negative, as long as you face it and accept it. The country where you grew up defines your cultural background so heavily that there is not really a way around it, it will always be ""your country"", in the same way as you will always have a mother tongue.

- **Language barrier**: this one is pretty obvious, the jokes, the fluency to really be active in conversations. This can be frustrating, and it is also the reason why you'll be attracted more by the expats and international community, where not only you can have normal conversations, but they will also understand better your experience and connect with you much quicker. 

- **Romantic relationships**: The fact that I moved abroad so much is not the only reason, not really worth it to focus so much on this relationship"" really impacted my ability to create a meaningful relationship. I've actually become a little cold on this side, because of a couple of very hard experiences in the past that made me reluctant now to throw myself into a relationship with difficult future prospects. The fact that you'll be attracted more to people with international backgrounds doesn't help, since you double the chances that one of you will leave at a certain point.

---**Advice for people that want to live abroad**---

- Don't underestimate the problems connected with obtaining a VISA for the country you want to move in. I pretty much gave up with moving to the US for now

- There is no perfect country, and I feel much closer to the US lifestyle, although I don't think the US is ""better"" than Italy.

- Visit the country for a few months before you move there for good. Expectations can be very different from reality.

- Don't expect things to go well the first weeks/months you move abroad. Life will most likely be much harder and frustrating than the place you came from. Don't worry

- When abroad, as usual, it's also a matter of luck to be in the right place at the right time).

- Research in advance every kind of information you possibily can about the new place. Even looking how the real estate/renting system work in a certain city or country can save you a lot of frustration (I experieced first hand that renting a room in Andalucia and in a US college compus is not exactly the same thing....)

- Don't go live abroad to escape or if you are depressed. You will most likely bring your problems with you.

Now that I graduated


Well, don't be afraid to ask!

**TLDR;** Go abroad

At Agrista

###Agrista
We are a small company, South Africa, United States, and Germany. In the office we work in English. 

We work hard, and our office is located in a quiet and idyllic section of Munich in an old farmhouse converted into office space.

###Munich
Munich is a lovely city, you have the fantastic English Garden for outdoor recreation. If you are into skiing or hiking, there are mountains less than an hour away, and many hiking and biking trails are even closer. There are several lakes easily reachable with the suburban train lines. There is a large and active expat community, so it is easy to meet people based on your interests and make new friends. 
###Language
Having recently moved to Munich myself from the US, there are lots of schools in Munich, and we hold an informal weekly German lesson in the office as well.

###Jobs
As I mentioned we are looking for:

* Junior developers
* Senior developers
* Network administrators

We work with a number of platforms and technology stacks. We aren't looking for people who know a specific language or framework

###Perks/Benefits
Some of the perks/benefits we offer are free lunch, depending on availability. As a worker in Germany, you will automatically be part of the health insurance, unemployment, and pension systems.

###How to apply
If you want more information or have any questions, or contact me and I will provide you with my email address.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,1370560485.0,,

For those new to /r/IWantOut, is to help people move abroad. Part of that is international IT recruitment. The founder of this subreddit, /u/ohstrangeone, has given me permission to post *relevant* job postings here.

Our company specializes in helping companies willing to sponsor work permits (or the local equivalent).

**The Jobs**

Our latest client is a company in Hanover

* Front-end developer: you're an expert with HTML/CSS/Javascript (jQuery). You're good at design and it's a bonus if you're comfortable with Photoshop, but if you can sometimes hack on the back-end code, that's a bonus!

* DevOps. Yes, not only will you be responsible for keeping their systems up and running, you’ll also have the ability to shape the operations management product all your colleagues are using. You will be there working with the dev team to help them build the right ops management system. One of your first tasks will likely be to help the team build a robust continuous deployment system with easy deployment/roll back capabilities.

* Two strong Perl devs. You'll be familiar with testing, developers get to work in offices with only two or three other devs.

**Why work in Hanover?**

* Lots of asparagus!
* 500k people
* University city
* Capital of Lower Saxony 
* Largest computer fair in the World (CeBIT) 
* Greenest city in Germany (forest, rivers) 
* Perfect for bikes
* Low rents (much lower than Munich, Köln/Düsseldorf)
* Low cost of living 
* Centrally located train station
* Airport 30 min from the office (by public transport) 
* 1.5 hours train to Hamburg

**The Company**

They're located in Hanover, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north of Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's a green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the world.

Oh yeah

Background: many of you already know me through my [Overseas Exile blog](http://overseas-exile.blogspot.com/), the US (duh) and Japan. If you're reading this subreddit, there's a very good chance that you'd like to figure out how to move to another country. Here's how: my employer, [booking.com](http://www.booking.com/), is willing to *pay you* to move to Amsterdam. 

Take a look at [our job openings](https://booking-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.welcome&amp;category_id=2726&amp;company_id=1006&amp;version=1&amp;startflag=1&amp;parent=IT%20&amp;levelid1=2726) (new openings appear constantly). We're hiring plenty of Perl, network admins, system admins, front-end developers and so on. I'd tell you what a great company it is to work for (and it's true), but you've heard it all before and why would you believe me?

Besides, surrounded by people from all over the world sounds appealing, a great place to work is just an added bonus.

As for Amsterdam: I've travelled extensively over Europe and I think it's one of the most accessible European cities for Americans as English is spoken almost universally. The city is very beautiful, walking down the [Prinsengracht at sunset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/onefiftyeight/3968105514/) is one of the loveliest walks in the world.

We're happy to hire rock star IT people, you can drop me a line here and I can send your resume for you and let our HR know directly (disclaimer: if you get hired, I get €1,000 for that). If you dont feel comfortable with that, you can [apply directly for the job openings](https://booking-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.welcome&amp;category_id=2726&amp;company_id=1006&amp;version=1&amp;startflag=1&amp;parent=IT%20&amp;levelid1=2726).

The hiring process is simple: if we think you're a fit, we will pay your relocation costs to Amsterdam, including putting you up in a short-stay apartment for your first month while you figure out where in the city you'd like to live.

Oh

Subsequently, then your best chance is to go to a country that has a working *holiday* visa arrangement with your country, where you can work odd/part-time jobs for 1-2 years. This visa is probably the best option for a lot of people here who just want to get out, but for some reason is commonly down voted. And of course, a very common way young people get out is to TEFL (teaching English) in various countries that are desperately in need of native English speakers, usually in East and South-East Asia.

**IS CANADA A BAD PLACE TO LIVE?**  
Last time, I thought it might be helpful to start with some negatives. This was hard to write (because I'm a patriotic Canadian and couldn't think of much), so Canada-h8rs, please chime in. For the most part, Canada is:

* Colder than you may be used to. Do *not* underestimate how frustrating this can be. Many immigrants really struggle with this. Not only is it unpleasant, back-breaking work), and remove the ice and snow encrusted on our entire car. We may have to do the same upon leaving work. You are legally required to keep your sidewalk clear of snow and ice (for safety), which many mean shovelling daily. Public transport and roads are all much slower in winter. We have less sun in winter - it may be dark at 4:30 or 5pm depending on where you are. If you're from Iceland, this is no big deal, but if you're from Costa Rica, you may not enjoy this. 

* Kind of like a more boring, and I would always choose Canada over the USA, but it's never going to have the same glamour as moving to the USA. 

* Not free of bad people. It's a terrible tendency of this subreddit, Scandinavian countries and Canada especially. In my experience, Canadians are some of the nicest people on earth, but we DO have crime, we have corruption, we have rude people, we have racists, we have sexists

* More expensive, and people tend to get paid more for whatever in Canada than in the US (except in some fields, like medicine or law). But our taxes can be higher. But you don't have to worry about medical insurance, and our universities are cheaper. Our rent is hard to compare nation-to-nation. So it's all a bit complicated. But a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a MacBook, your cell phone bill? All of these will cost more in Canada than in the US. (It's because distribution is expensive - Canada has EXTREMELY low population density. Small market spread over huge area.)

**COST OF LIVING**  
Actually

**DAY-TO-DAY LIFE**  
A few people asked about what life is like day-to-day. This seems like a really boring section to me, maybe this will be different from what you're used to? If you're American, this'll be dull! I'll talk about a typical work day for me when I used to work in a shop in Toronto. 

**7:30am** Wake up. I live in a quiet, I have time to fry up an egg with toast, but normally I don't. Have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, grab my bag. 

**8am** Leave the house. It's January so it's somewhere between 5C and, so a coat and waterproof boots are important, or else feet get wet from the snow. I walk three blocks to the bus stop, take the bus to the subway station (10m ride), and then take the subway four stops (8 minutes). Get off and wait 10 minutes for the second bus for about a 15 minute ride which stops outside where I work. This whole thing costs $3, or a monthly pass is about $125.

**8:50am** Head into my local coffee shop

**9am** Work starts! I work in a store with mostly people my own age (18-25) and the managers are really great people, so that works out to around $90/day before tax. But I can also make commissions, so a good day might be $120. I work 9-6 with 30m for lunch and a 15m coffee break. I should bring my lunch with me but I'm lazy and normally go buy a crepe across the street for $7-8. Oops. The guy who owns the place is Swiss and also knows me by name.

**6pm** I head home

**9pm** I might text friends to see if they want to meet up downtown and maybe go see a movie or hang out at a bar, or $4-5 for a bottle. A rum and coke is normally $4-6. Movies are $8-15 depending on the cinema and if it's 3D. We have a lot of live music in Toronto, so sometimes I'll check event listings and see what's going on that night. I'll try to go home before 1:30am when public transit shuts down, because a cab home from downtown will be $15-20. Some nights, I bartend, which is a great job if you can get it. It's hard work from 8 or 9pm until 2am or 3am, but I can pull in $200-300+ with tips. 

**FUN IN CANADA**  
[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cotGh4Lu29M) is actually a good place to start, in the video, but note that it's biased towards outdoorsy stuff (as opposed to cultural stuff), and that it shows ALL OF CANADA…so not all activities shown are possibly in all parts of Canada, obviously. 

In Toronto, among our small island provinces. Montréal and Québec City are like a small part of idyllic France in Canada, with cobblestone streets, outdoor cafés, public gardens, and a tremendously active arts scene. In the West, we have the huge city of Vancouver surrounded by mountains - perfect for an urban nature-lover. Canadians are proud of and love their outdoors in all seasons. Most born-in-Canada Canadians I know can do at least two of skating, too! I've taught at least three immigrant friends to skate.) 

Many middle-class and upper-class families own cottages, that families drive to visit on weekends or during summer vacation. They tend to be on lakes, and many cottage owners use their cottage as a base to swim, canoe, sail, skidoo, seadoo, tube, trampoline, for younger Canadians

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WATCHING**  
[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrA4V6YF6SA) is an American news anchor, which were in Vancouver, Canada. It's an incredibly good explanation, makes me all tingly as a Canadian, and has a lot of great video of Canada. I cannot recommend this enough. 

**UNIVERSITIES IN CANADA**  
[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) talks about how to study in Canada, but you'll probably be able to permanently live and work in Canada after. 

Where should you study? That's a hard question even for Canadian students. Universities commonly included on Canadian students' ""top picks"" include University of Toronto, Dalhousie University, McGill University, University of British Columbia, and University of Waterloo. (McMaster, Waterloo, Toronto, McGill

I attended a small university and much preferred it - more personal attention, Memorial University (least expensive in Canada), Acadia University (especially for biology, kinesiology, business, music, music therapy, pre-med)

I tried this post in AskReddit a few weeks back and I got downvoted to hell and back. I heard that you guys

For many reasons, spiraling healthcare, paralyzed political system, unemployment, ballooning debt, general anti-science rhetoric, etc make me think that this country might not be the best place for the future of my family. I know that the long-term severity of many of these problems might be arguable, but moving really seem like the option my wife and I might take. We excited at this as a chance to broaden our horizons and start ""fresh"" in a new home.

Foreigners, what other countries offer the best opportunities for a born-and-raised American? If it adds specifics to the discussion, I am finishing my MD and my wife is a RN (both with significant student loans, which we are planning on paying off regardless of our moving decision), and we are very 'liberal' in our political views (although I still welcome any perspectives from our conservative colleagues!). We have minimal fluency in Spanish and French. We don't have any family outside the US.

Our timeline for making a decision is about 5-10 years, and Australia. I wish there were more options but as a future medical professional (and with all of the vocabulary and verbal interactions that it entails), I feel confined to pick a country with English as the primary language. We hope to be able to visit these countries before making any big decisions.

Any thoughts on these three countries? They all seem ""better"" than the US by many social and economic measures, climate (we are spoiled by four seasons here), culture, attitudes towards immigrants, etc!

The thing is; life isn't quite awesome for mid-low class... I feel my country hasn't given me anything. It is taking everything I work for instead

Yes, we have a public university (which you can't attend to if you have a job), and yes, we have rather good beaches (in snobby places). But that's far from being everything a person needs to live comfortably.

I've put together a list of reasons of why I hate my country

* Taxes are high as fuck!  
Uruguay is the country with the most expensive cars in the world (and we are not talking about freaking Lamborghinis here), but you can just look at the picture)](http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/204609/el-auto-es-mas-caro-en-uruguay/).
We have one of the the highest basic VAT in the world (22%).

* Groceries and everyday stuff are expensive.  
Above bullet's consequence.

* Public transportation is slow and inefficient.  
I obviously don't have a car, sometimes I walk and arrive faster than on a bus.  
You would think ""just use a bicycle"". [No way

* You can't live with just one job.  
My mother is 50 years old and has 2, paying for the loan she asked for to buy the house, and food. She should be enjoying herself at her age, but she's working like never before instead. This hurts me a lot. She didn't want me to work until I was of legal age, luckily I was able to get a job by that time.

* We work our asses off for pennies
The government takes a percentage of our hard-earned wage and gives it to slackers and thieves who don't work, a knife or a gang of thugs down the corner. That's called ""equity plan"" and it's supposed to help balance wealth.

* People are depressed
No wonder why they are...  
70% of Uruguay's population has at least mild depression
I've witnessed 2 suicides while sitting in my chair at work (jumped out the window) and 1 while walking down the street (same).

I want to leave this place and start over in a country who gives opportunities to the working class... but I have no idea where to start from...

I know many of you want to leave due to social reasons such as the rampant ignorance from religious-conservatism. Maybe you're gay, you know.

New York and California are not Texas or North Carolina when it comes to gay rights, women's issues, etc. Portland Oregon... that's all I have to say.

Or, you know. (There's even a liberal sect of Texas, it's called Austin, and it's awesome.)

I know it's painful to live where you're probably ""stuck"" but please, it's much easier to have a job lined up in another state, than trying to find a job as an immigrant in another country, then trying to also get work visa AND sponsorship, etc.

Here's mine

Mine was more luck than anything. I got my first taste of Europe when my Mom decided to take me to Amsterdam for a 4 day weekend.  I experienced enormous culture shock the few days I was there and it was that amazing feeling that left an impression on me. Something about the historic architecture, made me realize that I would absolutely love to live in Europe. I remember specifically passing by a beautiful Dutch girl about my age, and she gave me a smile that made me melt inside.

That was when I was 17, but had no connections or opportunities that would get me there. 

I ended up joining the Air Force, I pulled mine up on the computer and it said Ramstein AB, Germany. I was so damn excited that I hugged some random dude next to me.

I got to live there for two years, London again, Brussels, Berlin and Munich, Prague, Valencia, Barcelona, as well as a bunch of little towns throughout Germany. Had the time of my life and now I'm infected with the travel bug. I plan on living abroad again at some point,self,

Some background: The estimated number of Americans living abroad varies from 4 to 7 million, if you're in that majority, this message is for you: **flying under the radar is going to be much, much harder starting in 2013**. This whole post is for you, too.

[There's this new law called FATCA](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Specials/Rebuilding_the_financial_sector/Spotlight_on_banking_secrecy/New_US_tax_law_could_have_disastrous_effects.html?cid=8520476) that's coming into force in 2013 that we should all be aware of. Google it. It's basically going to make hiding from the IRS nearly impossible. (When I say ""hiding"", the IRS has hired thousands of [new auditors](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE7A363X20111104?irpc=932) in their International Division, don't be surprised.

I work very closely with experts in US expat taxation

Here's some good reading material on the subject for all you expats out there:

* [American Citizens Abroad](http://www.aca.ch/joomla/index.php) is one of your best friends out here.
* [WATCH OUT](http://www.aca.ch/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=492&amp;Itemid=46) for the new FATCA filing requirements
* [Random blogger news](http://www.usexpatriate.blogspot.com/)
* If the subject *really* pisses you off
* A [small book](http://www.uscms.org/uscms_at_work/working_cern/taxes/ExPats%20Guide%20To%20Taxes%202009.pdf) that covers the details

Here are some things that are important to know if this information has taken you by surprise:

* There is a ""Foreign Earned Income Exclusion"" of around $91, YOU LOSE THIS EXCLUSION**. The sooner the better.
* The new FATCA rules will very likely see your foreign checking accounts declared to the IRS. If you haven't been declaring
* These laws are NOT just for the ""rich."" Everyone gets shafted more or less equally in the eyes of the IRS. Don't make the mistake of thinking none of this applies to you.
* These laws apply equally to green card holders who have left the US. It doesn't matter if you're not a citizen and don't live there anymore.
* If you are self-employed and you're not in a country with a [social security totalization agreement](http://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html) with the US
* If you are abroad and you've been filing yourself or with the help of programs like TurboTax

Ok

EDIT: Typos and added some info.

EDIT: **Lots of folks are asking about TurboTax.** My experience with it is from six years ago, my honest suggestion would be to have a tax professional prepare your taxes the first year, and then you can use that as a model for following years to file on your own. My personal experience is that my first attempt at it was an utter failure, even with a dead-simple tax situation. The return that I prepared and the one my wife's accounting firm did *were nothing alike*.

Ever since I have stepped out of my parents house(and became independent), perhaps a couple of months will do.

Somehow, that sounds like equivalent to dying. I have pondered so much about this. The money just kept on rolling, and I barely spend a dime of it because I didn't really know what kind of material possession I wanted to buy. I would like to travel though. I wanna go out and just live an adventure, be lost in a sea of strangers and meet people and party and do happy things that normal people do. *I don't really go out much at the moment, but I wanna change that, I wanna push myself to do something before it's too late.*

I'm well aware of the psychological maladies I will incur... there's more to it but I may enslist having a few others join me later on since I realize I'm in a unique position to assist others.

I own a 45-55' trawler I call the downeaster Alexa. If written elsewhere on reddit and another site about being a liveaboard on it until my dad fell ill last year. I've since erased the details until I'm certain I've wrapped up all loose ends and even still, though nobody has reason to go looking for me.

**My Resume**

- 3-year Liveaboard on a former fishing trawler that I've converted myself.

- I've disassembled and reassembled every part of my boat including near every element of the engine.

- Spent 3 months in the Yukon in a wilderness survival school for backpacking and canoeing. 

- I've backpacked the entire Appalachian Trail twice (NoBo and SoBo)

- I'm an okay fisherman. Haven't had a ton of practice

- Electrician, Survivalist, Hermit.

Before anybody brings into question the livability of the downeaster Alexa, I'm trying to figure my destination.

So my questions boil down to:

- Region

- Emergency Wuss-Out Exit Strategy

- Nutrition

**Region**

This is where IWantOut comes into play... I'm looking for tropical but I figure the Bahamas is off the table. I'm looking for uninhabited islands with very little chance of being contacted by other persons. So my best guess is the Pacific Archipelagos... Melanesia

I don't intend on having all my supplies brought out there willy-nilly and hoping to rough it. I will be doing research on the region and hopefully find an island that meets my needs

I'll be making likely two trips to the region I intend to inhabit beforehand including ""my island."" I'll have satellite photography taken of the region and investigate possible historical ones to see erosion issues. 

**Emergency Wuss-Out Exit Strategy**

It doesn't appear that LiFePO4 batteries would remain usable for 25-30 years as a ""just in case"" to throw into a Shortwave Radio, it could gum up or the engine could eventually fail.) Since Propane is the next most common fuel that hosts a generator and doesn't have an expiration, I may be forced to keep a spare tank (how much do they leak over decades?) in a sealed container with the generator as a back-up kit.

I figure there stands the possibility that nobody may return my call or assist in bailing me out

**Nutrition**

Maybe I should be in r/PostCollapse on here. I don't intend on bringing enough food for 25 years, no? Condiments, Salt, Seasoning?

I landed in Australia almost exactly 5 years ago.  It became my home.  I left in the US a mother I loved but had a very tempestuous relationship.  I never thought I was American, living up to the memory of my recently deceased father. 

I landed in what I thought was going to be beautiful sunny Australia. Unfortunately I made the mistake of choosing to move to Tasmania in the middle of the southern Winter. I walked out of the Airport in Shorts and a Tshirt into one of the coldest days Tasmania had had in a few years.  It was a shock.  

I moved into University Accommodation and found myself in a niche of my own. All the other English speaking foreigners were on exchange.  I was the only International there for 3+ years. Except the numerous Chinese and Malaysian students.  I quickly got lucky.  After about the first semester people realised I didn't belong in the Exchange group that each semester was born anew and semi segregated itself nor in the almost entirely non or poor english speaking International Asians.  As a result I quickly fell in with a group of 6-8 hard drinking Aussie lads.  I, one of my greatest accomplishments.  They are my best friends and I am lucky in that I am one of the few left in Australia, so as I prepare to leave I have numerous very good friends spread around the world.

WE quickly built up a horrible reputation for raising hell and getting hammered on a regular basis.  We went on insane Road Trips (Melbourne to Perth and back). I made friends that I would do anything for.  I also outside of this group developed a relationship that is not more important or better, he did. 

I haven't had as much success with the ladies down here as I like

I wasnt the high flyer in School and am still struggling to finish what I started (I only need two more units but cant bring myself to complete them) and am gonna have to finish them up online with the University of London and then transfer them.  I found a great job ($22 an hour

And I have had fun.  More fun than I thought I could.  The sort of fun you cant plan but spontaneously finds you on the way (he best sort).

All this and more that I cant put into words have made Australia and Tasmania more than simply the place I am

But all this is coming to an end.  My visa is running out and there was no chance or reason really to get another.  

So I don't so much want out as Its just time to be rambling on. I cant go back to America as I was never a citizen and lost residency for leaving for so long

So Monday I'm leaving.  I know the end of the line at moment is London

I loved Australia and recommend it to anyone who can come down. 

I have been wanting to write this for a while but finally have the reason.  I don't know what the percentages are on here but anyway.  Some of you want out.  Your home is boring or doesn't feel right.  I don't really know what that felt like.  I think I'm something of a minority on here but I think there are at least a few of us, with no place to call home other than where we lay our head, searching in vain hope for a place to call home.  Its sad but its liberating. Sometimes I get angry. Why couldn't I have been born raised lived and died in a place I knew was home!  Other times I feel like one of the most liberated people on the planet. I can go anywhere, with nothing tying me down. Its certainly one of the more unique experiences god or the universe has given someone and I do feel lucky sometimes. 

Im not sure Ill ever stop moving or find a home unless I meet the 'one' who is enough reason to stay somewhere and make it my home.  Wish me luck

But I know that I am currently floating without a sense of direction

I'm a female, talent-wise but also in terms of motivation and drive. My professors were encouraging me to apply for the greatest graduate programs in the country. Then I hit a rough patch--depression, end of a long-term relationship, my father suffered from a couple of strokes... and I started doing poorly in my classes. I lost my financial aid.

Now, am unable to receive financial aid, and therefore I am unable to finish my degree. I literally have one more class to take, JUST ONE, but I would need 3,000 to pay off my current debt and another couple thousand in order to take the class. So I've pretty much scratched that off my list of possibilities, since I don't make enough money to raise that sort of dough by next autumn. The course is even a long-distance learning course, but I totally blew my chance to pass it due to going through a period of depression and lacking motivation to apply myself.

I took a spontaneous solo trip to Europe while going through my bout of depression, decided that I wanted to go there. So I did, as an au pair and to obtain my certificate to teach English as a second language (I now have my TEFL certificate). I am now beginning my second year in France working as an au pair, I have a 1-year visa and it expires next September. I currently take French classes and I am slowly paying off the 1500-dollar tuition with each small paycheck. I have until September to figure out what to do with my life, and it's doubtful that I will be able to save up any money.

I have always been a person with extreme drive and motivation, but don't know how I could do that in France (or Europe in general) without having thousands of dollars to support myself. I thrive in situations in which I am in charge, or where the environment is constantly changing, and where I can apply myself creatively, but I don't know how to find this sort of work while abroad. I don't know how to find any sort of work while abroad, aside from being an au pair or teaching, both of which do not make me feel happy or fulfilled.

I feel really unlike myself because I suddenly have no idea what to do or where to go. I want to continue living in Europe (France in particular) after this year, I'd love to go back to theatre, but I'm not even sure how to get into auditions here in France. My French is not fluent yet. The original reason why I wanted to come to France was to study theatre at a particular school in Paris, but I don't have the money and the school does not have a financial aid system. I feel... fucked, with nowhere to turn.

Any sort of advice in any way would be greatly appreciated. Maybe you've been in a similar situation

**TL;DR: I was obtaining a degree, lost financial aid, don't have the money to take the very last course that would grant me my B.A. in Theatre. Working as an au pair in France, not really happy, need to develop a goal to work towards, but I have no sense of direction and don't know where to start my search.

It does seem like this provides Celta certification

The Groupon description: 
Like a pair of toy handcuffs, the language bond can last a lifetime. Forge linguistic connections with today's Groupon: for $79, you get a 120-hour Advanced Certificate online course from TESOL Express (a $599 value).

TESOL Express equips English-speaking tongues to teach one of the world's most useful lexicons to non-English-speaking students. Advanced Certificate classes prepare learners to pass the internationally recognized Teaching Knowledge Test at their leisure with sessions available online at any time of day, which are elective courses that reveal tips for teaching young learners and managing large classes, keep soon-to-be teachers' minds as agile as a cheetah on a televised dancing competition. Additionally, a personal tutor is on hand to shepherd students through the course.

After successfully completing the course, a contact database allows graduates to search thousands of language schools around the world to discern their ideal location. For more details, check the [FAQ page here.](http://www.tesolexpressonline.com/pages/TESOL_Express_FAQ)

**Update:** Well I pulled the trigger. The consensus (here and on other forums) seems to be:

A. The course won't teach you much at all

B. In much of the world the certificate you'll receive for this course won't get anywhere. The school is self-accredited

C. In other parts of the world, something that says you have some sort of qualifications. That's worth my $79 right there.

In other words, I don’t improve; in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear disease is incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself.

This part of the process is invariable and immortal. I set it down only so that newcomers to bumdom, like teen-agers in new hatched sin, will not think that they invented it.

Once a journey is designed, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all journeys. It has personality, temperament, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; not two are alike. And all plans, schedules

One of my classmates had guest speakers from Finland and Sweden skype into lecture, and tell them about the libraries they worked at, and she said she pretty much fell in love with them

I want to explore the possibility of visiting at least one of these countries first and then deciding whether a move would be possible, in terms of things I might not know just by browsing wikipedia?   (I wouldn't pass up Denmark or Netherlands either but I'm looking at the big 3 first.)

I think there might be a mindset that says DR = Haiti and many imagine extreme poverty

*Personal Backgroud*: I had it easy considering I transferred with my employer when our client needed to find a low cost solution (I work with an international contact center company doing online PR and Marketing). I came to the country for 8 months ""all expenses paid"" and helped setup the call center part of the business (training representatives).

I just returned to the US after five years. I am only visiting. But every day I have been back I remember why I left in the first place.

Americans (aside from the /r/iwantout crowd) don't realize that their society is broken. So there is know way for them to understand what they need to shoot for or how to rebuild it.

I met this girl today from Ukraine when I went to rent a car. She has lived here for a couple years and works at the car rental place. When she was walking me out to the car she asked me how long I was going to be in the US, better standard of living, etc., etc.). She looked me dead in the eyes and with conviction in her voice said, ""this place scares me. everything is so poorly made. I don't feel safe here. People here don't see how bad it is and they aren't working to make it better. I am leaving in a couple years.""

Keep in mind

It is impossible to change the masses to see what the problems are. There is no way to get people to stop worrying about abortion, the politicians, everyone is moving along with a momentum that will not slow down in our life time.

Note that many of the things I list are valid for ""established"" people, young and people living alternative lifestyles, I don't know enough anymore (I am 30 now) to say what goes.

Making contact. Swedes are afraid of conflict, when the subway is hopelessly late etc. But normally, you don't talk to people on the bus, in the subway, in the line at McDonald's or other everyday places. Swedes socialise and meet new people in circumstances where you go to socialise. Bars, pubs, parties

You will probably feel very isolated if you go here
If you have a friend

Be aware though that you should probably not ask directly if you can join in. Since Swedes are non-confrontative

Which brings me to the next point, with an empty rign around them in a crowded space and people looking the other way pretending not to see or hear. Same thing if an alcoholic or disturbed person talks loudly on the bus - people look the other way and pretend not to hear. Normally, most people can pick up the ignore-vibes and know that the subject is not wanted and move on to other topics without glitches in the social oil.

Swedes are rather nationalistic, our summers the brightest, our nature the finest, ur culture the most peculiar and our industry the greatest. In many cases our standards are high, in other cases we tend to become insular and arrogant, especially in some parts of the countryside. In short, we can whine about things in Sweden, but if you want to fit in, start to ignore you and think ""We'll why did he come if he did not like it?""

Sweden is very eligaterean. Few thigns piss people off like people flaunting their wealth and being arrogant about it. Modesty is a virtue. Bragging is considered impolite and jockying for position uncivilised. You are allowed to be successful as long as you are modest about it. A few weeks ago we had a blizzard in Stockholm and the subway had to lose down. The replacement buses were too few and people crowded up trying to get home from work. At Liljeholmen, punched him the face and told him ""you're evidently not that strong, get to the end of the line!"". 

Weed. It is illegal to be under influence of illegal substances in Sweden. The police can forcibly bring you to the station and test you if they think you might be under influence. While many Swedes think it is your business and no-one elses what you smoke, you will surely be asked to replace them at your own expense when you move out.

Swedes take off thier shoes when they come indoors in private homes. In offices and public buildings, it is not needed. Many Swedish homes have beautiful wooden floors that are ruinged by gravel, hard heels and black rubber sole shoes. If you feel uncomfortable going around shoeless, you can bring indoor shoes that you change to, just make sure your host is aware that you do use indoor shoes.",,False,t5_2r5hw,True

I am a 16 and a half year old male born (unfortunately) in Paraguay, and you can finish it early if you're not a lazy bastard, besides I didn't have much of a normal life, let's say I finished both school and high school without actually going to classes). After graduating in 2009 I entered into the biggest university of the country, with 13 (I lived in the capital), to study a career that I realized I didn't like 2 years later, I was studying Electric Engeneering, I didn't study enough and spent my hours playing games at home. Before turning 15 I realized 

I was an idiot, so we moved there. This is when this bad feeling on me started. I began going into another university wanting to study a career I knew I liked (Informatic Engeneering) this time, turns out the university doesn't have it, and the ones who have it are very small, poor, no really worthy universities (and even good universities are awful in Paraguay). So instead I began Computer Science, not a huge deal, but it's something that bothers me.
The thing is, the whole country, since I moved here I started to see how wrong everything was, you see, Paraguay is an awful place, full of hateful, ignorant and stupid people (consequences of poberty I guess), there are a few people who share my interests

I'm not sure how can I describe it with writing, and awful city, where everything is wrong, awful people, full of poberty, ignorance, awful organization, awful houses, in the middle of nowhere, no cinema

I know I sound like a crybaby, but I'm really not ok, this is not something I can deal with, I would not be writing this if I wasn't truly desperate. I feel like it's not fair, I have so many dreams and things I love, and I just can't see myself achieving them as long as I'm here at this country, I want to start a new life now.
And I honestly can't see myself wasting more years here, I think depression is worse, but it's very overwhelming, and if I keep going like this I'm sure I will enter into that stage :( And I hate having this feeling every damn day since I wake up until I go to sleep again, I feel like nothing I'm doing matters, I just want to curl up and cry all day, well, asking for advice in the internet most times is anyway, don't see the other countries being better than Paraguay, I know I am capable of a lot of things

I love Europe, the history, the culture, the people, all countries has its problems yes, but I feel like Europe (most of it) are the best countries to live, and how a country should really be in this century and decade... but not South America, and I had the back luck to be born in the first. And I don't know what I do if I just keep getting stucked here. This is not just whim

Now the reason I'm posting this here is because I need some advice on how to achieve this. How to go study into another country? Just get out from here, but he does extra hours, so he ears around 3000$ monthly, but there can be some times when he can't do extra hours, so just ears the base salary. But apparently, according to my parents, this isn't enought to move to Buenos Aires (the closest place I would like to llive) and study there (bugger).

I speak English and Spanish, Canada, the US, the UK and Spain I guess. My absolutely dream place to live is the UK, hardly the best place in the world I'm sure, but better than all those other choices.

I probably sound like a complaining moron right now, that I feel VERY bad.

So how can I move from here? How can I go study to another country? I'm so desperate right now. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Maybe get a scholarship

Any advice, thank you :(

True to the American form I can only speak English (4 years of Latin in high school doesn't really help), although I am very eager to learn a new language. Basically, I'm 1) Sick of America, and 2) Of the mind that it's impossible to have a perspective on anything if you've lived in one place your entire life, so I want to get out for a few years at least. 

**Where to move**

I've been researching a move to Western Europe for over a year now, but again, I'm not dead set on anything at this point except moving out of the US. The move will be permanent, as I plan to stay no less than 2 years (potentially more, but I try to keep my plans as open as possible since nobody knows what will happen in 2 years).

**Why I chose the Netherlands**

* Egalitarian culture

* Friendliness of the Dutch in general

* The fact that the Dutch are so good at English (better than most Americans in my experience)

* Lots of museums, and other cultural attractions (speaking of Amsterdam specifically, only city in NL I've been to)

* I wouldn't need a car

**And finally

1) According to the ‘Residence in the Netherlands’ document ([link](http://english.ind.nl/Images/ind4012-vvn-eng_tcm111-326109.pdf)), need to register with the Municipal Administration (GBA) for my place of residence when I arrive. I am wondering what the best course of action would be regarding registration with the GBA, since I won’t be able to look for housing until I am in the country. 

2) Next I will need to apply for a Residence Permit at the IND desk after 3 months. But, will this pose a problem in finding work, since I will not yet have a residence permit? 

3) Will I need to take the Civic Integration Examination if I don’t need an MVV? And if so

4) What are the options like for teaching English in the NL? I feel like I have a good command of the English language and would be able to pass any proficiency tests no problem. And since I don't yet speak Dutch

Oh and I currently live in the United States.

War

Lack of Universal Healthcare.

Way too many conservatives. I can't tell you how many times I have been harassed and in some cases even threatened by conservatives because I'm liberal.

Circumcision

The US has terrible sex education and extremely high STD rates. I had to explain to an adult man that girls start there period around the age of 12 (he thought it was 18). He didn't believe me (and called me a pedophile) so I got a girl to explain it to him.

People of the US are also extremely prudish

People of the US are xenophobic and nationalistic as hell.

Americans are stupid and I almost feel as I am Joe from the film Idiocracy sometimes.

Ive been called a traitor just for wanting to move to another nation.

Things like Glenn Beck and Fox News exist in America.

I would like to live in a place where I don't see people holding signs with dead fetuses on them (or at least not as much).

Is there anywhere in the world where I can talk to a stranger somewhere and they don't look at me as if they are saying ""Why the fuck are you talking to me"".

Even though I'm straight

I also want to live in a place with a lower crime rate and also less police brutality.


I have a personal story as well. I used to be very patriotic when I was younger

Also I have mild aspergers syndrome and when I was diagnosed (shortly after getting out of the Navy) they told me I will always pretty much be a ""foreigner in my own land"". So if I'm always going to be different

Also my childhood here if full of bad memories. I remember cars driving by and throwing bricks and me and being screamed at. I remember people pretending to be my friend only so they can play some kind of sick joke. Even now Ive been harassed by older overweight conservatives just for having different beliefs. I had the realization a few years ago that almost everyone who has done anything bad to me has been an American.

I'm currently a junior in college and 23 years old. I plan to attempt my move after I graduate. My family is well off financially and willing to help me move.

1290173226.0,e8mtd,My experience obtaining Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis.,mindtehgap,31,2,28,"I just discovered this subreddit

My qualifications for Italian citizenship were:

* Great Grandfather
* Grandmother
* Mother
* Me

If you can trace your lineage unbroken back to your Italian ancestor, because my grandmother was the oldest of 5 children and was the only one born before my g-grandfather became a US citizen. A poster in the other thread said that they renounce their Italian citizenship when they apply for US citizenship, but this is not the case. Over a period of several years my g-grandfather applied, then had my grandmother, and then actually was granted US citizenship. His declaration of intent to become a US citizen says that he intends to renounce his Italian citizenship, but it is not actually done and official until US citizenship is granted. This makes sense, because otherwise a person would become stateless in the meantime

The other possible problem is that women were not able to pass their Italian citizenship to their children until 1948. Again

The cost to gather the documents will depend on your specific situation. I paid nowhere near the $1000 cost mentioned by the OP of the previous thread. If you don't know your family's complete history and have to pay a researcher to dig it up, and then the final fee for my passport. How much this costs you will depend mainly on where your family documents are located, since every courthouse/government agency has different fees. I think the most expensive document for me was the apostilled copy of my marriage certificate from the US Virgin Islands, which was $25.

How long it takes for you to gather these documents will also depend on your situation. I live in Harrisburg PA, so documents from there were not difficult either. Here is the list of what I had to track down, and where I got them from:

* Great grandfather's birth certificate: I wrote to the commune in Italy where he was born (Isca Sullo Ionio) and requested this. Surprisingly I received it in only a month or so. I used a form letter on the web that was already written in Italian to request this.
**EDIT**: here is the link to the form letter: [http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp](http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp)
* Great grandparent's marriage certificate: Northumberland Pennsylvania county courthouse. This was only an hour drive for me.
* Great grandfather's US citizenship/naturalization record: This was also in the Northumberland county courthouse, or what.
* Birth certificates for me, and my grandmother, as well as death certificates for my great-grandfather and grandmother: All of these came from the PA Department of Health. Since I live in Harrisburg, I could just walk into the office and request them.
* Marriage certificate for my grandparents and parents: These were in the Dauphin county courthouse
* My marriage certificate: Via snail-mail from the USVI.

OK, they were apostilled by the PA Department of State. Again, this was very easy for me since I live in the capital.

Now that I had everything needed, this presents a huge delay because I have read that some of them are backed up so much that appointments are not available for a year or two. For Philadelphia, they did not even take appointments - you just show up during their public opening hours and present the docs at a window. BTW, the hours that the Philadelphia consulate was open to the public: 9am until noon, Monday, Wednesday and Friday - The European work-ethic stereotypes hold true ;) Another hassle for some people is that the consulate they need to use is very far away. Philadelphia, for instance, you are not allowed. 

The man at the consulate went through all my paperwork, but I'm not sure. You are supposed to update this whenever you move, get married, divorced, have a child, etc.  A few months later I got a letter telling me that they have sent my documents to Italy, and I was now able to vote, and successfully used it in the EU line at Heathrow immigration when I went to England.

Some random thoughts about the whole process:

* Drawbacks? None so far, this offer of citizenship was only made into law in 1992). I decided that it would be better to get it now. My sister had an internship with the NSA in college that required clearance, and they did ask a few questions about me. But she did get the clearance in the end, it just took a little longer.

* Most consulates require any documents not from Italy to be translated into Italian, although I have read that they do require this now. Which brings me to my next observation:

* The entire process for this seemed to be very inconsistent, and others do not. Also, the man working at the consulate decided right then and there that my documents were acceptable for citizenship. They don't send them to Rome for an ""official"" decision or anything like that. I was just surprised that something like obtaining citizenship in a country could have so many inconsistencies and variations in the process. I would have expected it to be much more rigid and much less dependent on the whims of a particular office or staff member.

.... 
I mean uh... dip into my 401K.

**Background details**
 - Have $26

 -Need money to pay rent(due Saturday)

 -I'm in Taiwan

-Have been unemployed since Dec 2010 so there has been no income recorded for me for 2011

**Ideas I've found from googling**

-~~Should I roll the 401k into a traditional IRA

-~~Can I claim ""hardship"" since I'm trying not to be evicted from my apartment?~~(answer turns out to be no)


I figure about $4000 cash in my hand will pay my taxes(i filed for extension)

**Update**: Being unemployed eliminates the ability to borrow from for my 401k. I can't borrow from it

My plan now is to roll over into a traditional IRA

**Update 2**
I just setup an IRA which I am rolling over $5000 to. I will be able to withdraw from it next week to my bank account

The tax liability is also reduced because I will have extremely low income for 2011. Any income i earn will be Foreign earned income, if that.


Thanks guys! And I know it's hard to believe based on this post

Quick back story, in an ambulance, as a hazardous construction medic, search and rescue, and in the emergency room. Before that I worked on cars, computers, did handyman work, and popped residential and commercial (semi-legit) locks for a living. I've got to see and do alot of cool shit with my life, friends

Recently my EMT/Paramedic license expired. I don't have any other licenses or certifications. I don't really have the cash or desire to re certify in this particular field. Most medics in this town (Las Vegas) make less than 14 an hour, but politics and cash have made it exceptionally hard for me to keep going. I feel like my life is falling apart and I don't have the money to go back to school, so life has gotten pretty depressing. 

As soon as I heard myself say this, and my affairs are in order. I have spent alot of time browsing this sub-Reddit as well as others, and I believe I have everything I need for getting around. I have made a list of things I have going for me and things I have going against me. 

**Going for me**:

1) I have acquired an amazing variety of skills that I have grown competent in over the years. I can do EMS, fix computers, fix most basic electronic devices, hang drywall, almost anything with construction including safety, plumbing, some carpentry, teach archery and CPR, none of this is 'official'. Also

2) I have no strong needs for 'quality of life'. I don't mind sleeping outside, bathing in sinks, sleeping in sleazy area's surrounded by less than desirable characters. I've stayed in areas so bad that I have been stabbed in the face, in the shoulder, and in the stomach. It hurt like hell, but its not something that I freak out about. Its life, right? Just another story. 

3) I am great with making new friends and telling stories. More than once here in town I have went to a dive bar alone and wound up crashing at a new friends house. 

4) I am fantastic with quick-thinking/working things out on the fly. I have a nose for getting both in and out of trouble, I don't want to be starting shit in foreign countries, it seems rather disrepsectful on my part. 

**Going against me**:

1) I am leaving with 2000 dollars in my pocket

2) I have no solid plan, and then just roam. I have no way back, and once the money runs out, I know I am probably screwed. 

3) I am diabetic. I have good control over it

4) I really have no strong sense of self-preservation left anymore. I have seen alot of death and alot of life in my time. I would be lying if thoughts of suicide (lots of EMS personnel wind up committing suicide at middle ages) haven't crossed my mind. But I believe this to be inherently stupid because I have no idea what the rest of the world is like

5) People are telling me that this is 'running away'. I have no real response to it because on some level


I am taking a small/medium military 35-liter pack that I can fit 2 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of socks in, as well as a pretty small but spiffy med-kit for real emergencies (not first aid) (I will always be a medic first). I have a roll up hammock that compresses to a 2x2x2 square that I used to sleep in when I was homeless. Plus a towel, some rope, a fold-able 6x4 foot canvas sheet, a good knife, and a leathermen. There's enough room for about 2 days worth of food and water (stuffed it with Ramen and 3 quarts of water)

So, either illegitimate or legitimately? Most of all, do you think I can find a purpose out there, something to change my perspective? I don't want to see the touristy crap, I want to travel through rural areas, learn some culture and language, do and see things I haven't done before. 

Please, concerns, or criticisms. All input is welcome, and I thank you in advance.

I was in Japan for two weeks from early December and I have to say that I LOVED it. The sights

I just wanted to share what was actually my first (and incidentally

My plane had just touched down in Tokyo from frosty Beijing. The temperature didn't really shock me, maps, general chatter - Before this, the only Japanese I'd known was from watching far too many anime series.

As I wheeled my luggage to the platform, ballerinas, freckles; you get the picture. She was extremely cute. Plugged in and tapping away at her phone, I took the empty seat next to her, thinking she wouldn't notice.

However, because I took Japanese for a term when I was at elementary school, and the teacher would always make us ask in Japanese when we needed to go and refuse if the students got it wrong. It's a rather cruel practice, now that I think about it)
Anyway, I had read up a lot on Japanese culture, their customs, what's offensive, what isn't.. etc. so I immediately go into apologetic foreigner mode, which went along the lines of *Apology-explanation-follow up apology* using some of the few words of actual Japanese that I know.

She stumbles ""Ah! Uhh.. I want.. to go..... uh..""

""To the toilet?"" I proclaim.

""Hai! Can you..."" *Gestures towards her luggage*

""Sure

I smile at her. A smile means the same things the world over.

As she gets back, and I became increasingly anxious as to when I would be reaching mine.

Eventually

No.

Fucking.

Way.

She walked over to me and handed me the note. In it, what time the trains arrived, which platforms they were on; everything. And all in both English and Japanese too. She had been on her phone researching and translating the directions for me.
And at the very bottom

She nodded at me as she disembarked, this was fucking heart-wrenching - to see that there were actually people that were this nice. I felt like a jerk just being amongst those people. It gave me a really good first impression of Japanese people as a whole.

Mostly this is due to new laws (FACTA) requiring close reporting by foreign banks to the IRS regarding American customers and their assets.  But surely some banks must still be willing to take American customers (and their money).

Do any of you know of specific examples?  The reporting in the U.S. would have you believe that there is no place around that'll accept deposits from Americans.  That would seem to create a high barrier for expats as they would have to move their money out of U.S. banks and convert it to the local currency on a frequent basis due to the inability to maintain a local bank account.

A friend recommended this subreddit and I thought I should give it a try. I really could use some good advice. Bad advice is welcome too but the good kind might be more useful. My story might be long so bear with me.

I've wanted to live in the US for as long as I can really remember. After graduating from Oxford University with a law degree I went to California to get my master's degree. After that I sat (and passed) the NY bar exam. I now have a license to practice law there. I then worked for a company out in LA who was going to transfer me to NY when it came to the time to get a new visa. However, and a job that was helping me pay off my debts. Now I'm back and probably soon to be unemployed and living with my mum. I lost all my independence and I'm incredibly heartbroken. I haven't lived here in the past 2 years and I'm completely unsure about where to start. My qualifications, experience, and contacts are in the USA and I'm unsure about how to get back.

So here goes; I'm a 20 years old finnish guy who wants out. I have no futher education than high school. I've worked in retail (hardware store)
I've been thinking about packing my backpack and trying the expat life in Cambodia. And oh yes
I speak fluent english and I fucking love chatting with strangers and I am very extrovert so I have no problems building a social network in a new country but I do have a bad habit of being very impulsive.

I spent a month in the country last fall and absolutely fell in love with the capital Phnom Penh. I made friends with some expats and the expat community seemed very honest and awesome to me.
Every expat who I spoke with told me that expat life in the capital in very glamorous if you like the ""wild east"" atmosphere and a weird lifestyle. 
I only know the absolute basics of khmer but I'm willing to learn the language and I know that the country opens up a lot better if you know the language.
My friend has an appartment in the city with AC and internet and it's like 150 dollars a month.
I'm very aware that because I only spent a month in Cambodia I was stuck in the legendary ""honeymoon phase"" so I only saw the good things about the country and ignored the bad things. But I still want to go.

But as my very nordic self tells me to get straight to the point so I will: 

How easy is it actually getting an english teaching job there?
I was offered some jobs and people told that you don't need a certificate or to be a native english speaker
I plan on starting with a tourist visa and see how it goes. I don't mean to permanently move to the country just live the expat life as long as I want to and after that just travel around Asia.

Another question is that how well can you live by an english teaching job in there?

You have very lowest taxes which is pretty wonderful after getting taxes 50% month after month.  You are still the role model of the world.  You have the best universities and smartest brains in America even with all the idiots.  Your salaries are high.  And most importantly

America is a huge country with an endless amount of natural resources.  America can totally support itself without needing anything from anyone.

I would like to get out and I have been exploring the options of European countries

I have applied to a few job openings posted online in various places through the use of indeed.com and CareerBuilder (mainly in the U.S.). I have also applied for many of the job openings in the mining industry in Australia. They have IT jobs available as well as other positions that I personally would not have a problem doing however I have been turned down for some of these and for others I have not received a response. I have done the Canadian foreign worker assessment on which I scored a 67 which is a passing grade and I have spoken to a Canadian consultant but it seems my only real option there is to visit Canada and search for a job while in the country before my stay is up. Even then it would take 6+ months before I got the ok to begin work.

I don't feel it is a must that I do something IT related but it seems to be the best chance that I have at this point and still so far my attempts have failed. If anyone can offer my some tips or advice I would greatly appreciate it.

**Note:** I currently provide internet marketing services for a few clients which allows me to work from anywhere but right now it's really not much. I have been trying to get more clients but it is extremely difficult to do from my current location. This is due to the fact that most serious clients prefer to meet with you in person or through someone they know. Freelance websites are over-saturated so I have not been very successful with those. If I could get more clients it would be much easier to visit various places to look for work and residency. This would also be a way of showing customs workers that I can sustain myself while in the country.

CP:  ""OH, in that case, you have to contact the consulate there.  They have to translate the marriage license and certify it there for you.  Then they'll send it here and have us certify it.  Then you can go to your lawyer and continue with the steps from before.""

Long story short

My SO is a civil engineer and PhD student who is completing his specialty in urban planning from the perspective of water resource management.

We're both committed to becoming career academics and are highly dissatisfied with the recent political attack on the National Science Foundation (NSF) along with the general decline in quality of life here due to a myriad of factors of which I'm sure many of you are aware.
We're also concerned that there really isn't significant political will here for either of us to be effective instituting the kind of changes we wish to see regarding long-term planning on a regional or national scale. Also, bank bail outs, etc.  

So, I understand that moving and acquiring a visa or citizenship can be a long process and, through our studies, each of us will have the opportunity to spend a semester (or longer) in a different country to conduct our respective research. Therefore, we'd like to compile a list of countries where a) our skills would be more useful and appreciated and b) we could raise 1 to 2 children in a safe area with rich educational opportunities.

It's been my dream for a long time to work 100% remotely while traveling. Or, but I am in my late 20s and do not have enough money to retire yet ;) 

I've been working my current job for about a year. I started out working onsite at the company I work for in the midwest, because I think it will be good for me, and I will visit friends and family. I do great work, and I am lucky enough to have a kickass manager, whose trust I have earned. I'm able to do all my work (network engineering) without being onsite.

I'm moving out west (USA) to work remotely and also work on a business I started with my business partner. Toward the end of this year I will head south of the border, making my way from Mexico through the Caribbean and Central and South America. I speak fluent Spanish, and I am lucky enough to have been to Mexico several times and to have friends there, and in other Latin American countries. I have spent a grand total of 6 months in Mexico, and I've been to every country in Central America at least once, and I've been to Colombia a few times. I'm sure I'll travel Europe, Asia, and Australia as well

I don't foresee losing my job anytime soon, especially with my connections.

Fast forward to today and I've worked mostly IT jobs starting with support, apache, various other types of servers). After all of this time my old hospital bills that got me into this mess in the first place are about to disappear completely within the next 3-5 months, and my old credit card bills shortly thereafter. I want to go back to school, and I would love nothing more than to be able to actually attend a college or university full-time in another country.

Before all of this started

I have a plan for at least the next year. Once my old bills are taken care of, it would be nice to stick with the original plan of attending school in Scotland but I know the UK is a tricky beast right now. I would be open to a Latin American country (I'm told as a Hispanic, I would easily be able to get in there), Russia, Asia or maybe even Canada. I'm completely open to suggestions, though.

To answer the questions in the help doc first:


Age: 31
Education: Bachelor’s in English / French, hehe)

Job skills: I’m a film editor so I’m proficient in Final Cut Pro &amp; Avid, plus various experience tutoring, translating, and editing texts peppered throughout.

Language skills: Fluent in Spanish &amp; French, Italian, German.

Convictions: not yet

Alternative destinations: I’d like to stay in SA but I’m open to different locations within
Temporary or permanent: both though I’d like to wind up in something semi-permanent

Nationality / location: American



So why am I asking for help?  My window for making this decision is short and I’m having trouble sorting through all the information.  I feel like I might be trying to do two things at once and I want to find a compromise.  My inspiration was the idea of spending some time without a set destination and living with almost nothing, and finding remote / local work that utilizes my higher-paying skills.  To state that more succinctly: I want to vagabond and then ideally work as little as possible so I have time to focus on writing &amp; art.  I’m willing to compromise on all of this but I don’t want to be without a net.



Some specific questions:


How much money do you really need to “go with nothing?”  I’ll be leaving with a few thousand bucks tops.  My bills are around $100/month now but may go up a bit from student loans.  I want to avoid sticking around in the states to save up more because moving would put me in more debt than traveling would.


A lot of places want to see an exit ticket to give you a visa.  How do you resolve this while keeping things open-ended?  Is it different when traveling by land?

I am sad because I truly want to live abroad once for a year at least.  I wanted to do it in college

I guess I should be happy that at least I have a full time job with benefits (or at least that is what I hear.  Not sure until I actually start).

But I feel really sad.  I may get a chance in a couple of years to go abroad after I get some work experience in this company.  Maybe go teach English abroad then.  But I really fear it will too late then.  

I'm just depressed from it all.  It sucks.  I should have gone when I was younger.  Now I may have to wait until I'm 27 years old to go.  

I just don't really want to deal with this anymore.  Help?

If it is just because of some of the comments I made about the military, but because they want to join up and do the service for the USA.

Thankfully I was considered a matured student and my work experience helped a lot.

I'm also extremely lucky to be able to qualify for the GI Bill which will cover like 95% of my tuition fees and living expenses so everything is set.

This is how I made it happen.

I moved to Mexico and enrolled at my local community college in the US. This allowed me to get a feel for school since it had been so long and I wanted to make sure I would be okay with it. This time everything was a lot easier

I got a job while in school and managed to balance work with school

I am planning on taking a trip to the UK this year in the off-season around mid to late December until early January to visit family/friends and to get a general lay of the land before making the big decision to move. I definitely plan on going to Kent, I would like to know the best places for a university age student to visit.

**My right to abode as a non-natural born citizen**

As far as my right to live in the UK: On my British passport it says that I have the right of abode in the UK... Period. However

**Money and work**

Money will not be an issue, of course, need a job. Therefore, with my minimal work experience, what are my chances at getting a job (non-professional) to help keep me on my feet?


**Education**

As aforementioned, I will have a general A.A; This means I will have completed courses in areas of study such as math, science, humanities, history, and various elective courses (in my case, mainly business and humanities.) Additionally, as they are non-existent in the UK. At the moment

**TL:DR**

**My questions:**

* What are the best places in the UK for a university age student or just in general?

* As a Non-natural born British Citizen who has already acquired their passport will I need a certificate of naturalization in order to stay in the UK?

* With minimal work experience

* Will any of my credits from my two year general A.A degree in America transfer over to a UK university or college?

I have been to Germany (NRW area- Cologne, just a student loan that with my upcoming tax return and cashing out about as much stock, I could have paid off by mid-Feb. I am definitely what you would call risk-adverse, but I seem to have a lot of things going for me if I did decide to go: German wife, no debt, no kids, decent sized 401k.    

Though the thought of it still scares me, hopefully in the field I am experienced in, and without having to speak a lot of German (at least not right away), I would do it. It's scary for me, but the thought of living and working comfortably in Europe, especially Germany with my wife, sounds like a dream. I also worry about my age and wonder if I am too old to give this a shot for a few years, I face the prospect of losing my wife.

For years I have had an obsession with Europe and I’m trying to get some real advice on potential careers that are both realistic and would allow me to have a decent amount of job opportunities there. 

I was stationed in Italy and Turkey for a couple of years and I’ve had the privilege of traveling to Slovenia, Germany, France, England, and Ireland, so this is hardly a rash, spur of the moment idea without any prior experiences of traveling there. I honestly and wholeheartedly want to move my wife, and myself to Europe in order for us to start and raise a family there.

Before I get any further I want to point out the fact that my wife is from France, but I’m trying to find potential jobs that might allow me to work with English while I’m learning the local language.

I’m currently half way through a bachelors degree in Psychology, and working with people so I would like to find something that is in some way shape or form involved with one of these things. 

So at last…What are some careers that would give me the option and flexibility of being able to live in a couple different countries in Europe? I appreciate all help and suggestions!

Anyway, and managed to come out alive and successful. I do plan on acquiring UK citizenship in the future, so I also know quite a bit about other types of visas.

A few things that I'd like to point out for those that are considering the UK:

* People will judge you when you tell them of your plans. I worked at a small Italian restaurant which was like a second family, you'll hate it and come back."" ""Why would you leave America? It's such a great country."" ""Just don't stay there too long! You might meet a British boy and marry him. Don't marry Europeans, only marry Americans.""

* You'll find out that most people don't understand basic geography. They seem to associate England = London. So whenever someone would talk to me about it a second time

* It's expensive. I'm sorry, everything is expensive. I'm lucky where I don't have to pay for travel expenses, but if I did I don't know how I'd be able to add those costs plus shipping all my stuff (~$200) plus going to uni ($17k) plus renting a flat and living there (~$1.4k/month).

* Talk to your parents about it (if you're under-age, then took a gap year. When I said that I wanted to go to England, they thought I was joking, but they are extremely supportive now.

* If you want to get a Tier 4 visa (the one that lets you go to school there), you don't have to make a new visa unless the major you're switching to lasts longer than the one you went in on (which it will if it's a completely different subject, i.e. Architecture -&gt; Astrophysics, because you'll have to take all the courses you've missed). If you want to switch before you've applied, it gets a little more complicated because they have to issue a new CAS. However, if you want to switch to a different uni, you do have a make a new visa application.

The lake is not too far from Guate City but ""remote"" enough that it's still fairly low-key. It's really picturesque with the volcanoes surrounding the lake.

There are a bunch of villages around the lake. You have to take the boat from one village to another and they each have their own vibe:

* [Panajachel](http://correresmidestino.com/panajachel/) is the main touristic point and probably the most tacky village. Mostly a main street with a market and services for gringos... great views on the lake though. Lots of people who visit the lake only stop there.
* [San Pedro](http://correresmidestino.com/el-lago-de-atitlan/) is famous for being a great place for long-term residents. It's small, British and pretty much all nationalities who run small restaurants, pubs etc. Fairly easy to find work there.
* San Marcos is very new age. It's a small village and mostly caters to yoga/meditation folks. Again
* [Santiago](http://correresmidestino.com/villages-lago-de-atitlan/) is the most traditional village with a lot of Maya and some interesting beliefs.

There are three ways to work in Ireland as a foreigner, or just 30k+ euros in certain industries), and work permit (no salary restriction). These are explained here: http://www.fas.ie/en/Job+Seeker/Working+and+Training+Abroad/Recruiting+outside+Europe.htm

Green card requirements go into more detail here: http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html

If you don't qualify for a green card, this is a either-or situation, as there are almost no jobs in the EURES database for Ireland (100 jobs across all industries, and over half of them seem to be for French or Finnish speakers).

I'm feeling like enrolling in a University in Germany might actually be financially feasible.  In fact European Universities look like they would be even more cost effective than studying in America.  I'm paranoid I'm missing something though.  

Could anyone with prior experience shoot me a couple tips about how much I would actually be charged for tuition?  (I'm especially interested in Germany)

This website/a lot of websites say about 500 euros per semester.

Edit:  I'm interested in studying Biology.  Not sure if I want to look at Forestry

I'm also in the 3rd term of my German sequence o.O  I'm sincerely interested in taking classes in German!  That would be cool.  n.n


**tl;dr How much should I as an American student (not being an EU student) expect to typically pay per semester/year?**

Edit: Here's what I've found.  Edit: Fixed cost of living from 10 months to 12.

* 500 euros = Current typical tuition per semester
* 800 euros = Typical Cost of Living Per Month (varies from about 600-900 euros depending on location)
* 200 euros = Fee per semester (This is on the high end

* 500 euros • 2 semesters = 1000 euros per year in tuition
* 800 euros • 12 months = 9
* 200 euros • 2 semester = 400 euros in fees

9

1 euro = 1.43 United States Dollars

11

Does this look right to you guys?  Are there any things I'm not considering?  

And yes.  This is somewhat on the expensive side.  I'll continue looking into other countries like Norway.

**Second

* 0 euros • 2 semesters = Free tuition at most public universities
* 700 euros • 12 months = 8
* 100 euros • 2 semesters = 200 euros per year in fees (Dependent on school)

8

I'm nearing the end of my sophomore year in undergrad, and I most certainly don't mind enjoying life, so I want to find something that reflects what I am able to do.

- I'm not independently wealthy, which explains the philosophy degree.

- I *love* anthropology

- I am competent at speaking English (using proper grammar, and I have had some experience with instruction before (though nothing professional-- I've done some close work with a high school marching band as an assistant director).  Teaching English in a foreign country (a poor one would be good) is completely acceptable... maybe even preferable to whatever else I could be doing.  It doesn't have to be fancy.  I just want to be somewhere where the focus is on people rather than profit.

- I'm 20 years old.  I have a large family and they tend to not give very much support to novel ideas.  (This could be a problem.)

So, or even specific, suggestions?  My post-graduation plans are non-existent, but I'm open to pretty much anything.  I might just need some help finding a direction.

I'm finishing my Master's degree in Chinese Language in Columbus this year

I have a bachelors in Political Science and shortly will have a Masters in East Asian Languages and Literature (Chinese). If anyone is familiar with Finnish companies or organizations that would find this background useful please pass them on. I am trying to compile a list of possible employers in country that I could contact.

The other option is studying. I haven't ruled this out but it will difficult given my finances. I am planning on taking a Masters in Economics at the University of Helsinki. The problem is I will need to locate atleast some part time work to support myself and pay my US student loans. Does anyone know the availability of work for international students in Finland? What are the regulations for student workers? 

Keeping in mind

If anyone has any general information that might be helpful I'll take that too. I have a year to prepare and line this up.

*Edit* Since I will have to pay student loans in dollars

*Edit - 2* If anyone has some tips specifically about finding employment in Finland that would be highly appreciated.

Once I got out to LA, that shit changed my life. I hadn't known what it was like to not not look over my shoulder while walking anywhere by myself. It was a complete shock. And I fucking loved it.

As the title says, I don't have any ""real"" experience in IT, and my IT skills (such as web development, DB management or sysadmin skills, for instance) have become a bit rusty over these last few years, so it would seem that my best bet would be aiming to continue in this line of work. Whether the job is in academia or not is not really important (to me) right now, although I do have some experience as a TA due to the grant I held.

According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada page [CIC](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp) I'm eligible for the IEC initiative that would allow me to work there up to one year, I would like to work there ""permanently"" (basically until I'm deported).

My main questions here are:

* 1) A PhD in Spain is considered worse than worthless. Is it the same in Canada? Should I desist looking for a job there until I manage to find some real experience?

* 2) I speak what I consider to be fluent English (the dissertation was written in English and, but I do not currently speak (any) French. Is it necessary to speak French to be able to move there or can I learn it while I'm there? I also speak some German, and I took an intermediate (B1) level a couple of weeks ago, although the results won't come until October.

(Father was born in former Portuguese colony),,21,5,17,"My father was born in Goa (part of India) back when it was still a Portuguese colony. That makes him eligible to apply for Portuguese nationality

I've done a lot of research on the process, because the Portuguese government needs to ensure that you are really entitled to Portuguese nationality, due to many Indians who forged documents to make it look like they were born in Goa.

This has led to my biggest challenge with this, have all given me different answers about the process and what is required. Some have even told me it is not possible based for our particular situation.

I have finally decided after much research to move the process forward. I emailed several law firms in Lisbon, so it's a lot of money to lose; the other is that we will be providing a lot of important documents to them, like original birth certificates of me and my parents, marriage certificates, and passports, as well as power of attorney, and it will cause a lot of problems to have these things lost/stolen/destroyed or misused/abused.

So I want to do some proper due diligence to make sure I won't get scammed. I'd like to get your opinions on the firm itself (any red flags?)

The website of the law firm is http://www.cscadvogada.com and the lawyer's LinkedIn is http://www.linkedin.com/pub/clara-da-costa-csc-lawyer-portugal/63/845/b1b).

Here are the pros:

* Their email response times aren't that bad
* The website seems decent enough
* The English (on the website and in their email responses) are good enough
* Google street-viewing the address (http://goo.gl/maps/8F4nM) seems to show that it does exist

Here are the cons:

* The website has a very low Alexa rank (6
* archive.org has a record of it going back to only July 2010 and the whois records show the domain was registered only in November 2013 (even though her LinkedIn profile says she worked there from 2007)
* Her LinkedIn profile only has 6 connections
* The law firm seems to be just a one-person operation

What are your first impressions? Trustworthy? Or do you see any red flags that I might be blind to?

Also

* How many Portuguese nationality applications have you worked on for people born in Goa that were successful?
* How many Portuguese nationality applications have you worked on for people born in Goa that were unsuccessful? Why were they unsuccessful?
* I see you have posted your LinkedIn information on your website
* Are you the only lawyer at your firm, illness, etc)
* How many years has your current law firm been in official operation?
* Does your law firm have any office or presence in Goa itself?

What additional ways can I be researching how legitimate they are? It's one thing to send the law firm itself a list of questions for them to answer, considering the cost and the sensitive documents I'd be sending them)? So what else should I do?
