&gt; Here is a hauling release.  I'm sure it has all kinds of interesting issues -- we're going to iron out problems for the next few releases without embarking on anything major in order to restabilize it.  The tile-wise physics causes some oddities on its own (items can't be given a meaningful sub-tile width, and that might lead to conflicts/false shortages on occasion.  We'll have to continue playing around with it.  **As far as I can tell, old saves load up fine and have usable minecart/wheelbarrows, so feel free to move your data/save folder over to the new version.**  You'll notice your old save stone haulers moving slower -- get some wheelbarrows built at the carpenter's for your stone stockpiles to alleviate that problem.

**New stuff**

* Minecarts can be used to haul things around on carved/constructed tracks/bridges ('h'auling to set up routes)
* Dwarves can be set to guide
* Track stops used to slow/stop cart and/or dump the contents on vehicle entry
* Pressure plates can be triggered by carts
* Rollers can be used to push cart along when powered
* Minecarts limited to one per tile in general
* Wheelbarrows can be linked to stockpiles in order to move heavy objects (it'll auto-request one for stone stockpiles)

I spawned in three humans, and unskilled, and one was naked, armed with a steel battleaxe, and a grandmaster axeman. 

I spawned in rattlesnakes and had them bite each of the unskilled men twice on the left hand (just to make sure it took). I then waited for the syndrome to kick in for both of them (which causes extreme pain, rotting, and blistering in the affected area, as well as nausea and dizziness).

Then, he was good as new; he didn't pass out again and when I flipped control over to him, he wasn't showing any pain whatsoever. He also stopped bleeding from the syndrome as soon as he was amputated; the stump bleeding took a bit, but that's an unrelated issue. The other one, however, was still experiencing extreme pain and all of the other nasty issues. The amputee also recovered from the dizziness and nausea quicker than the control human, from what I can tell.

Toady One - You can carve tracks in stone now. I haven't done the wooden/metal constructed tracks yet. I haven't done minecarts either, we'll have to change how mining works, but I want to get the carts moving first. By the time we're done, we're hoping to have the mining system remain about the same for new people, so they don't have to worry about tracks to get started (this might involve default embark wheelbarrows which dwarves would automatically use), but things will be much more efficient for people that use tracks and minecarts, across various industries.

So i started preparing by building her throne room and quarters, held up by a single support linked to a lever that can be pulled upon my whim. I like to think of it as my own variation of the Sword of Damocles.

In the spring after I finished my preparations, Vampire Queen of the Pages of Murdering, along with her Vampire King Consort. I knew i had to get them both under the hammer. I checked the bloodsucking witch's profile, checked her kills. She had accumulated well over a thousand kills, all of them dwarves. If i had any doubts before about the righteousness of my cause, they were erased right then; Cerol had to die.

I put a burrow in the queen's throneroom, and I put the King Consort into a squad, so I can be certain he's under the hammer. Luckily, it worked, they were now both under the hammer. It was time to put my plan into action, it was time to end the bloodsucker's madness, it was... 

**Hammertime!**

I ordered the lever to be pulled, not mine, as if he founded Nilashok just for this moment, so he can avenge the hundreds of innocents who perished to slake Cerol's unholy thirst. He pulled the lever, the hammer dropped, and the filthy bloodsuckers were crushed to death.

I do not know what the future holds for Nilashok and the Pages of Murdering, they will have to sit under the hammer, and be reminded of their place.

UPDATE: It's been over a year since Cerol's demise. We haven't had any contact with the Pages of Murdering since, they still haven't picked a new monarch. I'm wondering if the power vacuum I created started a civil war or something.",,False,self,t5_2qyn1,1367124281.0,,

[""Nope!""](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.slashfood.com/media/2010/06/jimmy-dean-1964-obit-590.jpg)

""Do you want to?""

[""Nope!""](http://progresscityusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fritz.jpg)

Well then you're not a necromancer, prey upon the weakest of our society, in this case the dead, in an attempt to subvert everything that makes Dwarf Fortress a thriving democracy where all men, provided that they're white, conservative, and happily married

Jimmy

[""Nope!""](http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/kirby/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/js1.jpg)

If you're like most young men, this is the realm of the necromancer, and by allowing your refuse and corpse stockpiles to see the light of day you open your fortress up to all manner of ghouls. 

But do you think you're safe

[""Yep!""](http://mrwriteon.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-soda-pop-board-of-america-1950s.jpg)

WRONG. The only thing that matters to Johnny Red is that there's a ""Tower"" civilisation on the embark screen, but necromancers will descend upon your little chunk of suburbia with all the fury of the dingo men back in '33. 

And Jimmy

[""Yep!""](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IC-asNVmgvY/Tp4tcNt9lVI/AAAAAAAACpw/VovfSwxVSkk/s1600/girl+on+tractor.jpg)

WRONG. Necromancers can raise the dead anywhere on the same Z level as long as it's possible for them to navigate to within visual range, and past both water and magma. If there's a corpse above ground, the red menace will find a way.

Necromancers don't even need a corpse to raise an undead super soldier. That horse skull you saved from your last genocide? That's an undead super soldier. Marmoset legs from your first spring? Undead super soldiers. A dwarf drowned in the bottom of your reservoir or local river? Undead goddamn supersoldier with no greater joy than ripping apart your war dogs and good Armok-worshipping women and turning them into undead goddamn supersoldiers.

The only way to combat the red menace is to think like the red menace

1. Don't cut zombies. An axe is to a dwarf like apple pie is to patriotic displays of misguided nationalist affection. However, Jimmy, the undead supersoldier's only weakness is its brain, and the tool of choice for destroying a brain without dislodging surrounding tissue is a war hammer. **Decapitation does not damn the red menace.** Eventually you may wear down an individual part, but only at the cost of turning every finger, toe, and meaningful chunk into an instrument of necromancy. 

2. Purge. [**This is the recommended graveyard/refuse set-up of the United States of Mountainhome.**](http://i.imgur.com/opL37.png) See how it's segregated from both the surface *and* the rest of the fortress? No miasma gets through those doors, his armies will be locked out and his strongest forces (*your* fallen military) will be shut down even harder. A magma-safe floodgate valve connected to a volcano ensures your ability to hold periodic holocausts, once and for all removing the future undead supersoldiers from this world while acting as an emergency weapon against any who do happen to rise up in the worst case scenario. Two ropes in front of that valve serve as sacrificial altars, as we're nothing if not slaves to Armok and every orgasm of fire should be in praise of he through whom all blood is spilled.

3. Retreat! The moment a necromancer raises any undead on the surface, then your fisherdwarves and wood cutters, then caravans and egg-layers, and before you know it the surface will be overwhelmed as every dwarf below it scrambles up to collect the baubles of the fallen. The *second* you get the notification that an undead has interrupted an action, use the burrow system ('w') to segregate all dwarves below ground, lock down water and fishing supplies to underground reservoirs and wells, forbid (q&gt;l) any doors or hatches leading to the surface, blow your magma valves

4. Real Mountainhomericans always list three things using four. Know the difference between the common zombie, a husk or thrall is to the zombie as a hydrogen bomb is to a sling shot. If you see one of these monsters, and monsters they are, do not attack it. Do not approach it. Do not hope for a second that you have any chance at capturing or killing it. Lock down your fortress, release your magma valves, and purge everything above. You will not win against even a single thrall, not even hell wins against thralls.

Keep in mind these simple steps and the above diagram and you can indeed push back Johnny Red's attempts to dethrone the living. It is only through diligence, how about we go back to ""Do you want to"", because you're going to.

A couple of civilizations had demon law-givers or demons posing as gods, but they didn't seem to be doing any harm and the people loved them, so in the end I left them alone.

Then I journeyed into the depths of the world

Dayfly brutes swarmed and coughed up some terrible extract, but were dispatched easily enough with a quick stab to the head.  The first sign of trouble was a group of dimetrodon monsters, which actually managed to land a couple of hits and didn't seem to go down as easily as their smaller companions.  The dimetrodons soon became quite many, and were joined by dayfly brutes.  The end came in the form of a rib-crushing kick to the upper body, which sent Sibrek flying, shattering a bone in his right arm so he lost his shield.  Before he could recover, another dimetrodon which bit off that arm while another kicked *off* Sibreks right foot.  Sibrek had just enough time to lodge his sword in the thick skull of one of his aggressors before being reduced to complete mush.

---------------
Loaded up a game and found a sight I liked, scarce trees, with a steep waterfall.  Good times, good times.  

Launched alright, or on the other side of the map.  We were safe for a bit.  Time to strike the earth and move everything safely under ground.   

Ok so miners make quick work of the soil and we move everything into a temporary store room 2 Z levels down.  I've got Urdith the Axedwarf up top making sure nothing bad threatens the fort and uhm...wait what?  'An eerie vapor'?  The hell is that?  Well it's nothing Urdith can kill so move him underground as well and soon enough it blows over.  So that was new.  

Next an undead raven comes on the map and pretty much makes a bee line (he moves really fucking fast!) for Urdith.  Urdith dispatches him quickly

They've made it pretty far, so I'll have somewhere better to stash people than a temporary store room.  After that, they move onto the storage room and we'll pretty much have a legit base at this point.   So I move up top again and...what the fuck?  Urdith is still fighting ravens?  How many of them are there?  I check the 'u' menu (whatever it's called) and there's only 2 ravens on the map, so I figure I've caught the onslaught at the end.  But Urdith is getting tired and not dispatching them quite as quick as he did the first time.  But, with his axe, the raven undead are no more once again.  Oh and there were about 3 more of those vapors during all this, but they didn't even come very close to the base

Oh hey, no one goes above ground ever again!  The ravens have taken it over, let them have it, their spawn rate is off the charts in this embark evidently. 

Moving on.  He did his part.  I won't have a skilled tree cutter but it's no biggy, really one death isn't a big deal.  I've come back from 2 lone dwarves hanging out in a hole before thanks to a lucky immigrant wave, so I'm carrying on with my solid 6 and accompaniment of horses, kitties and doggies and...shit, freaking cat went outside and got the ravens all riled up.  Crap it's leading them in the entrance!  Damn it I've got 2 ravens inside the entrance now.  Granted there's still a few z-levels between me and them but you know how that goes....

And so it went.  The ravens killed the cat and severely depressed its owner.  Alright well let's send 2 miners (of my 3) and 2 others and surely we can kill two undead ravens.  I dispatch my cohort and they manage to kill both ravens, so it took a bit and thus one of the dwarves got severely wounded.  Oh cool he keeps lapsing in and out of consciousness.  Oh great it's Ulrick, the depressed one.  Well, disband everyone and leave him to his devices.  Oh good someone's picking him up and carrying him to a bed.  Good dwarf.  

Time passes.  Well Ulrick died of his injuries.  No coffins yet so I'll just stick him in a corner somewhere since I'm working on floodgates currently to get a sealable entrance going so stop the ravens.  The horses are getting hungry so far down

How the hell can you be interrupted by Ulrick?  He's dead.  How the hell can you be killed by Ulrick?!  He's dead!!   Well he's dead again because one of my dogs evidently got him.  Ok, ok so corpses come to life now after you kill them?  That's cool.  Oh...shit so that horse that just starved not too long back....fuck.  

Well I quickly set all corpses to be thrown off the bridge, the ravens.  And...right let's just dodge into the water.  Good job number 4.  I hope you dro-  you weren't supposed to actually drown!  Fuck forget it, I'm walling everything off.  When all else fails, put a wall in front of it.  Ok so....yah you weren't supposed to seal yourself on the other side.  Well you're gone number 3.  Down to 1 and 2, but it's my fisherman and my last miner, but that's pretty much all I need to at least survive until Fall.  Hopefully the first wave will actually come given the....situation.  

Alright so spirits are flagging now that number 3 is officially dead.  I throw up a fishery in the corner of my 8x8 meeting room and dig a hole to the river.  Food and water, mine down, rinse and repeat.  Butcher the fish, eat the fish, mine down, and....OH YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!  A mussel shell reanimates?!  Well how hard can it be to kill a mussel?  Not very as it turns out, as, it wasn't the mussel that killed my fisherman, and quickly dispatched my fisherman.  I was left to just sit and contemplate how

He was not a master thief. Not by a stretch. He blundered blithely into my fortress through an unfinished second entrance I was building (emergency as in ""EVERYBODY ON THE SURFACE GET THE FUCK INSIDE WITH ALL DUE HASTE""). I had one cage trap set up in it (I was gonna put some more in

Lame.

So off to the animal stockpile he went while I got that shit finished. Drawbridge in front of it, but I had nothing else to do until I could start construction on a mega-project I'd started drawing plans for (never finished). 

This is where Stozu got his chance to fucking shine. 

I didn't have that many cage traps set up at the main entrance, but suppose I would later on? I'd feel stupid, then.

Shortly before Stozu had blundered into that one trap

I had no idea.

I started pitting gobbos into the slaughter pit

Stozu was one of the last selected to be slaughtered. I'd forgotten all about him at that point. 

All about him and his fucking iron dagger. 

His first victim was the poor fisherman that had decided to help out with the pitting (river was frozen over). ""Oh sorry

I thought for sure that Stozu would just run to one of the exits and get re-caged. I was wrong. Instead of up

“Let’s see this shit

In his mad dash

Good riddance

So with three dorfs down and DF pathfinding being what it is, you asshole, you can't at least solve my fucking cat problem? 

I'd like you to envision the entrance to the caverns. It's a long, with another drawbridge at the end of it. Around the middle of the hallway, another rookie squad is training. If an FB or blind cave ogre or some shit decided to attack them, that'd only weed out the weak, right? 

Stozu would suffice. 

The leader of the squad was named Id Mysteryknife. Don't remember their gender. Id was pretty okay with his (fuck it, do the math. His squad was somewhere around the same level. So, kinda shitty. 

Enter Stozu, and bellowing ""Let's do this shit, pussies!""

He killed two of them. Goddamn TWO of them within his first page of combat. One of them stabbed in the head, and tangled with Id.

Id held up pretty well

He apparently judged that this was enough and finally ran into the caverns proper. As he made for the edge of the map

I was fucking impressed

An iron statue of a goblin and a dwarf. The goblin is laughing. The dwarf is in the foetal position. 

Later

I salute you

You probably do not like where this is going.

I believe the fourth dimension can be modded into Dwarf Fortress. You know how we have z-levels? We break the three-dimensional world of Dwarf Fortress down into layers, except in a clumsy manner with things like StoneSense, which require abstract rotation to view the whole thing. It's much better for us to take our square slices, in complete certainty of the x and y position of everything we see. This is practical in general for viewing the fourth dimension as well: take gradual, periodical, three-dimensional slices of the whole thing, each of which can be individually comprehended quite handily. To look at different parts of it, in w-levels

However, with &lt; for up and &gt; for down, and the w-layers, with { for ana, and } for kata. Each pointy bracket press sends you to another vertical layer in the pile, like a delicious stack of pancakes peeled apart pancake by pancake. Each curly bracket press sends you to a different three-dimensional plane entirely, like several stacks of pancakes lined up next to each other

There is, you have a floor and ceiling, yes? You are usually attracted to the bottom layer, because there is a force pulling you downwards. Therefore, you place a floor underneath yourself, downwardly oriented to your center of being (analogous to a ""tile"" in Dwarf Fortress: floors are in the bottom of the tile). However, in four dimensions, just because... well, in the center of the series (it is going to be in the center of the series). Therefore, you are pulled ana

To actually have your dwarves traverse between the layers, you can also build marquee trapdoors, traps, et cetera... there is no greater fun than watching your opponent splatter on a marquee six stacks kata to you. ""Oh no! Now I have to clean up four-dimensional blood!"" Or drop him into your magma chamber that's completely walled off in that stack... there is so much potential.

There is also the matter of what to actually put on the other stacks. I have come up with three options:

1. Exactly the same thing. Boooooring.

2. Something procedurally generated from your regular landscape

3. The surrounding few tiles in the overworld, or such? What if you are adjacent to a volcano? What if you are close to both a glacier and a forest? How about a glacier AND a volcano? Four-dimensional pump stacks operational...

Memory problems and such notwithstanding: I'd play it. Thoughts?

Embarking on this endeavor

The river provided adequate water supply, in this case a fire-breathing colossus, made its much-anticipated entrance.

Dwarves were immediately alerted to a surface attack and rallied inside the fort. They promptly drew the bridge once everybody was inside.

So the colossus waited

The *cats*. They were the key. They continued to lure the titan further into the shafts, had grown quite expansive. One scurried around, successfully dodging large gouts of flame... for a while. The second was hidden, shivering, on the stairwell one level down, several dozen tiles away. One of two floodgates stood in the way of the colossus.

It paused in front of the standing floodgate, it was standing in front of a pile of jumbled gears and mechanisms. *How could we have overlooked such a thing?* To think this could have been successfully accomplished had only the second gate been lowered.. well, lessons hard learned are hard forgotten. Crestfallen, the fortress waited in anticipation. Wells were built.

Bored again after another brief foray on the surface, but again the beast stood but meters away from being stuck, at least long enough for a miner to breach the river. 

But maybe, but wait- no.. too many dwarves leaving.. Crap now the colossus is heading back up, okay quickly now.. Ha! Sealed! And- aww, over half a dozen dwarves inside? Well, worse sacrifices have been made. 

The colossus does not attempt to ascend the shaft

No, the creature is occupied enough to allow for the digging of a tunnel around the wall. A few dwarves choose to surface, the rest remain in the pit.

Mayor McHatedbyeveryone was a surprisingly good mayor, which we have none of to begin with.  When his duties were expanded to include trading with the merchants, he showed remarkable dedication to duty, not once failing to rush directly to the trade depot when a caravan arrived.

Then came the Winter of Tragedy, as the militia was burned alive in their archery towers while those that ventured outside to face the threat directly were either torn apart, or encased in ice as the Titan melted the river beneath their feet, only to have it refreeze almost instantly.

One of the survivors, so he lost his home as well.  He was obviously unhappy, but appeared no worse off than the rest of the surviving military, and was an excellent teacher and marksdwarf, so was assigned a squad of 20 immigrants to train to replace the losses the fort had suffered.

Things progressed well until mid-summer, the military housing was rebuilt with a shower hall at all entrances and a fire control system was installed to prevent the loss from happening again.  Then our hero got it in his head to take his problems to the mayor to sort out.

He marched his squad down the hall to the civilian quarter, where he marched his command into the Mayor's mansion for a meeting.

Face to face with the mayor he pleaded his case

The now departed Mayor was killed instantly in a hail of crossbow fire and the Commander was almost instantly voted to replace him.  Upon his election

[My Current Layout](http://i.imgur.com/JcNJJ.jpg) so that I can break things down by area. Yes

**What You Will Need:**

* Manager(With a small office)
* Bookkeeper(With all counts set to accurate and a small office)
* 8 Female Untrained Dogs
* 2 Male Untrained Dogs
* Mechanic's Workshop
* Butcher's Workshop
* Craftsdwarf's Workshop
* Carpenter's Workshop
* Bowyer's Workshop
* Leatherworker's Workshop
* Tanner's Workshop
* Metalsmith's Workshop
* Smelter
* Wood Furnace\*
* [DwarfTherapist](http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/)

\* Hopefully you have an available source coal or lignite to make into bars of coke at the smelter

**Part One: Picking an Effective Squad Leader**

I found one of the things no one really ever points out is how a squad's captain influences the squad. They effect things like training and squad moral

Using DwarfTherapist, and Personality.

For a **melee squad**, Fighter(and/or Dodger/Biter/etc.), and one of Swordsdwarf, Hammerdwarf, Macedwarf, Axedwarf, or Speardwarf.

For a **ranged squad**, and Ambusher. Armor User and Shield User are important to have(as well as fighter/biter/etc.), but not as necessary for a ranged squad.

Now that you have found potential candidates, and Intimidator. Don't worry if your dwarves do not have any of these; they will develop in the role of a Squad Leader. Teacher helps them instruct other dwarves, Leader gives them better decision-making skills, and Intimidator helps overall squad moral and frightening away enemies.

Finally

* Calm demeanor
* Bravery
* Able to handle stress
* Awareness of emotions
* Trust
* Preference for security and stability
* Organized
* Confident under pressure

On the other hand

* Lazy
* Apathy towards other's suffering
* Thrill-seeker(though risk-taker is okay)
* Impulsive
* Disorganized
* Lacking confidence

With a handle on those three aspects of your squad leader in mind

**Part Two: Building the Squad**

Once you have a squad leader chosen, and a melee skill to melee squads, and assign squad members who have Marksdwarf and Ambusher to ranged squads. If a dwarf has both, put them in a squad based on which one has room after assigning all other skilled dwarves. If both squads have room, assign the dwarf based on his highest attack skill(whether it's melee or ranged). Don't worry if your squad still has room left over, you can fill it up as migrants show up to your fortress. You don't want to assign dwarves with no military experience(thankfully this includes Armor User and Shield User) because they will get an unhappy thought(even though it will eventually go away, it will take a very long time).

**Part Three: Squad Equipment**

I've found that

Just starting out, and then butcher your dogs. **Do not** butcher puppies until they have grown into dogs and had puppies of their own. This way, you have a renewing source of *leather*, *bone*, and *meat* for your dwarves to use.


Once you've started butchering your dogs, bolts, meals, etc; I have space go back so I don't use spaces here) and select it. You'll want to start with *Leather Armor* and *Bone Bolts*, and later assign pairs of leather boots, gloves, cloaks, etc. Assign 30 of each(it's the maximum for some reason); you will get a lot of messages that it cannot be completed for lack of resources, ensuring there are enough for both your marksdwarves *and* hunters

Next, more often than not, to have Soldier(Cannot Follow Order) as their current task.

After you've cleared that up, so in case one of your dwarves fancies that well-crafted elven bow, you want him to be permitted to get ammo for it. I usually designate each squad to have 200 bolts + 200 arrows exclusively for combat, and 100 bolts + 100 arrows exclusively for training. Another issue the game runs into is when you have one stack listed for both combat *and* training as is the default; dwarves will designate them for combat first, and you end up with none left over to be used for training. Having two sets(one at 200 and one at 100) will assign bolts/arrows to both combat *and* training, resulting in your ranged dwarves training more often. Don't forget to have your manager order the construction of leather quivers for your ranged dwarves, they won't be able to pick up *any* ammunition unless they have one.

This takes care of a squad's starting equipment.

**Part Four: Melee Training**

There are several tricks behind getting a squad to train in the current version(0.31.25) of dwarf fortress, **Area A** is my melee training area. I like to give them a nice open area, though 10x10 squares will do just fine.
Have your manager order the construction of an Armor Rack *and* a Weapon Rack. Put up doors in the room, ensuring they overlap eachother completely. Once you've made it into a barracks, use T to designate it as a training are for your military squad on *both* racks. This is important.

Now that you have an area for them to train in, tapping it again until it is on *training*. Use + or - to assign 4 dwarves to the training session. Hit Shift+Enter, then o to designate a *second* training session, also with 4 dwarves, to the *same month*.
This is also important, copy(c) the order and paste(p) it into *every **other** month*. You want your dwarves to have time off in between training sessions so they don't get an unhappy thought from long on-duty shifts. Do this for each melee squad you have, alternating months between squads.

That's all you need to do; once that is set

I started playing recently and after abandoning two early sites for silly reasons early on (i.e. Dwarves not digging) my third embark is looking promising. Nothing super eventful has really been happening at all, at least for it being only my third.

For some unknown reason a Dwarven child went insane. I think I locked him in a room but after a while he got out and started bringing the ruckus in my dorm and bedrooms. No one was really around so after attacking a few workers who promptly ran away he got in a fight with a dog for around 20 pages worth of a combat log. The rest of the fort caught wind and it turned into a panic as they all chased him around, breaking his ribs and causing them to puncture his lung, making it hard for the child to breath.

So /r/dwarffortress, such as seeing how long trolls can survive in magma, how far I can launch goblins with bridges, trying to create a ""super hammerlord"" by continually feeding him vile forces of darkness, and so forth. Needless to say, the whole fortress is antics and I've probably irreversibly destroyed the cave systems/surrounding landscape.

Now, which I had pretty much appointed god-king of everything. I've even gone so far as to give him a slade hammer/suit of armor by changing the raws a little. Of course, the magma pillars didn't quite work as intentioned, and the throne room begin to fill with magma. My super dorf couldn't escape, but as the magma filled the room and all the dwarves died, not only was he surviving, but the magma wasn't affecting him. So my question, is if somehow his slade armor was protecting him from the magma? Have I discovered a way to colonize the magma sea?

**TL;DR super-dorf is somehow able to survive in magma with his slade armor**

The caravan just left and I'm thinking ""something exciting needs to happen.""  Yeah

**A vile force of darkness has arrived**

Hooray!  Something for my military to do!  My only concern is that Urdim is out trying to kill something and is going to get caught in the siege and killed.  He's one of my most useful dorfs, Urdim is up north on the surface, hunting as usual.  Worse yet, a group of trolls spawned only a few paces away from where he was.  I give the ""Everyone inside"" burrow order and sadly decide to write poor Urdim off, thinking there's no way he'll make it inside.  Well, that was a dumb thought of mine.

Urdim immediately starts shooting at the trolls.  They converge on him - while I was watching he was surrounded by four trolls at one point - but Urdim is not going to go down without a fight.  He dodges everything they try to hit him with

Then Urdim runs east, walled off, with a drawbridge opening to the west side of the wall.)  Urdim heads south with three lashers following him.  Two of them give up chasing but the third closes in and manages to get a couple hits in, smashing two of Urdim's fingers and toes before Urdim smashes the goblin into pulp with his crossbow.  (I want to believe that Urdim didn't exactly get *hit* in the hand so much as tried to catch the whip so he could beat the gobbo to death with it as something new for once.)

So now Urdim is headed south, bypassing them, while they run after him.  He skirts the bottom of the map before heading northwest again, still gobbos chasing him.

Meanwhile, sending the first two squads that hit the bridge straight to hell.  There's still the sword squad, with some of them chasing Urdim.  But at this point, Urdim is headed towards the fort entrance, at least in a general direction.

After the first couple of squads are slaughtered

The swordsgoblins that were chasing him show up and, with everyone fighting around him.

Once the siege is broken, he hadn't passed out, he had decided to *take a fucking nap* in the middle of the bridge, during a siege.  So when he wakes up, what is the first thing he does? (he still has broken fingers, mind)  He thinks to himself, ""Why ain't I killin' nothin'?  Ah, I needs me some more ammo."" and goes to pick up more bolts

So, I'm sleepy"" and taking a nap in the middle of the siege.

He is getting a nice tomb built for him.  I don't have any brass in the fort

Sox Uetdmeso ustru Snosstrosp(fun fact: It's name means Sox Carnagewaste the dead of clouting-a fitting name, and it's most deadly feature: It spat webs. No matter. The second it reached the first cavern level, it would immediately be swarmed from all sides by my military-no way it could survive.

However, not up. As I discovered, about ~30 dwarves had gone down to collect the candy.

It massacred them. All of them. Not a single survivor. And

It killed about 6 or 7 more-2 of them swordmasters-on it's way up. However, who proceeded to very, very violently kill it. It fell by my axe lords hands.

Now, 36 are miserable, 1 is very unhappy, 1 is unhappy, 3 are content, 1 is happy, and of course, who is ecstatic for ""making an artifact recently"". The artifact? A dwarf bone hatch.) Probably about half of them are running around naked or throwing themselves off cliffs.

Here's the kicker, they've been training. While everyone else was falling in love, they've been training.

The result? A hardened military, in which case it'll suck to be that guy when I send my militia after them.

In other words, I will probably have 6(maybe five-the axe lord has family, and is currently very unhappy) dwarves left-dwarves who have killed cyclops and entire goblin sieges with ease. Dwarves who could give less of a damn about who's dead or alive. When it's all done, I plan on raising the drawbridge, and having them live the rest of their lives all on their own. It'll be fantastic. Like the ""Only the initial 7"" challenge, only with 5/6 of the most badass, drunken midgets around. I'm excited as hell.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that after Sox died, numbering about 30 or 40, and after 30 seconds of skirmishing with my troops, they all lay dead.

DOUBLE EDIT: I'm now at about 27 dwarves

TRIPLE THE EDIT FOR TRIPLE THE FUN: Yup, and she was....swiftly dealt with.

AND YET ANOTHER EDIT:...damn. My militia commander somehow got struck by spinning rock that shattered a few bones

FINALLY: Okay, have ten dwarves. I guess 4 of the little bastards decided not to go all bat-shit, much to my chagrin. So now I'm stuck with them. I plan on letting caravans IN, but migrants OUT. With any luck, I can get a breeding population of dwarves going. I have a child who I hacked to allow for hauling(it was for roleplaying purposes, I swear!).  I currently have half the old population entombed, and have only had one casualty to ghosts-nothing serious, and not wanting to risk it with bowgobbos I waited it out, but it's 5:30 in the morning,self

*TL;DR - you need a 12x7 embark for the full plans, and designate from the top-north-west corner.*


The megaproject I always wanted was to recreate the Mines of Moria - accurately.  Of course

The classic map - even if never endorsed by Tolkien

[The map](http://i.imgur.com/lSvvi.jpg)

So I owe a big thanks to /u/Skage16 who hand-traced the map onto eight separate levels.  

[The Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/1gb89f/ok_i_have_completed_the_mines_of_moria_trace/); [the layered map](http://i.imgur.com/keg1gLJh.png)

From there, even black &amp; white) and corrected the skew that introduced.  Then it was down to a lot of work in excel, making things geometric again and connecting the halls across z-levels with ramps.  I've also had to make some changes from the plans to fit things in - 12x7 embark is large enough (from 15x11!), and the contents of the top and bottom levels have been relocated to aid in cavern-related problems.  

The contents include: 
 - One excel workbook
 - a pair of .csv blueprints for Quickfort to lay out the whole 12x7 map (so big
 - a cropped edition [the western halls] cropped to fit in a 5x5 embark.  This one is a more plausible challenge.  
 - the two maps that the work is based off.
 - this document.

All I want to see is someone carve out and inhabit the full mines - it's a long held dream

Now Ma'am, would you like your father to be buried there? Or do you have some family plot you'd perhaps prefer? Speaking of... where's your mom, miss?"" 

Endok sobbed, in the tomb in the lowest level of the house. Endok left that day for a new home, she vowed never to build a metal thing, never to return, to build a new life somewhere where no gorilla would ever dare go.

----

**PLUNG WOOSH**

Endok's bolt flew past the ear of the great gorilla. She saw him, off 10 or 20 feet away. She looked at him, and in that instant they knew each other's life story, She knew his mate had died. Maybe she killed her, who knows. She knew that that little gorilla had nothing else, she knew she had become the monster that killed her father, but she wouldn't let that happen to her.

She fell into a deep depression after that, with the tiniest metal thing in her hands, a little gorilla made of silver and menacing with spikes of obsidian. The tiniest metal thing, and an old copper waraxe sticking out of her chest.

------

*NB. This, but all the (non-flashback) events basically happened. A Engraver named Endok randomly decided to carry around a Steel xbow and bolts, picked a fight with a passing troop of gorillas, killed 5 of them, spared one (she missed from 1 tile away, no kidding), walked back, I wish I recorded the game,False,

* Instead of wasting all your wood on barrels

* When placing a building like a cage or a statue


* You can use the manager to dispatch jobs very easily. Press u -&gt; m -&gt; q


* You don't need to individually assign each dwarf a bedroom. Just set it as a room first and set the size


* You can set macros to record and play back key sequences. Use ctrl+R to record a macro, say you want to haul trade goods to the depot. Go into the depot menu and choose the category of goods you want (say, crafts). Now, press ctrl+r and hit [enter] [down] 10 times in a row, and press ctrl+r when you're done. Now, whenever you press ctrl+p, it will press [enter] [down] 10 times

* Bonus tip: Have a tower you want marksdwarves to defend? Build a cabinet or whatever in the tower, right next to the fortifications (fill in the rest of the tower with walls or fortifications or whatever). This ensures the marksdwarves will be standing adjacent to the fortifications and able to shoot. ",,False,self,t5_2qyn1,True,,

This Rainbow Scout arcs through the air in a dangerous above-ground area scanning for hidden ambushers while remaining safe from attack and unable to run wildly away in fear and get themselves killed.

Work on the guard towers was nearing completion.  The mechanics were busy preparing traps for the next inevitable goblin invasion.  The windmills were creaking in the crisp mountain air, but the glare and heat were far preferable to the horrors of cave adaptation.  From the barracks came the clanking and grunting of the melee squad honing their skills.

A sudden goblin attack had left the fort wary, desiccated. A vampire was on the loose, somewhere, but they had yet to slip up.

Ringwild's walls were strong.  Its forges were hot, of the riches to be had.  And so they came.

The smell of death on the air.

The horror of fifty corpses

The shrieks of the goblin ambush as they were torn to shreds by rotting hands.

The shouts of dwarven panic as they attempted to close up the walls.

The masons were the first to fall. Fearlessly running to the open wall, lodging uselessly in shambling flesh. Decaying hands, ripping, tearing, striking.

The melee squad charged forward.  Two corpses fell, and then the horde was upon them. Dwarf after dwarf, ripped apart, lives cut short at the hands of the undead.

The rest of the fort was soon among the ranks of the dead

Except one.

He still stood in the main courtyard, back, forth, an impenetrable wall of razor-sharp iron.  He darted from zombie to zombie, reducing the undead to piles of butchered meat. He was known to Ringwild as Nomald Cobaltseasons, the elderly, battle-scarred master of the axe.

For months he fought the undead, without food without drink, single-mindledy crushing every undead abomination in his view, seemingly blind to their inevitable reanimation moments later.

Until, hadn't drank, hadn't laid down for months.

He dropped his axe.

He wandered, but the stocks of alcohol did not beckon him.

He passed the great dining room

Nomald walked (slower, ignoring the piles of furniture that had never been used, *would* never be used...

And, slowly, painstakingly, a coffin, and a large slab of rock.

He dragged them both to the center hall of Ringwild; once the Stronghold of the Sabres of Helping

He took up hammer and chisel with shaking hands

And, and waited for the wailing spirits to end the long, bloody history of Nomald Cobaltseasons, known to the world as Das Clincheddreamy: the Unkempt Word of Splashes, murderer of five dwarves in Ringwild and thousands more across the world; vampire.

It was an enormous siege

By this time I expected the enormous amount of mounted riders to have gone through the 3 tile wide tunnel I had made that allowed access from the northern side of the river to directly inside my walls but instead they ran into the edge of the river where the water was lowest and became trapped by the current. After ten minutes of them just sitting in the shallows I realized my smaller squad of 3 people had managed to kill all of the trolls (about 10) attacking from the south without 2 of them even being harmed

I now sat watching as the siege of still roughly 35 goblins and their 35 mounts just remained in the river while my highly developed squad of 10 just sat inside the walls waiting for them to do something. I now began to fear that if they did eventually make it out of the river they would greatly outnumber the cage traps I had placed at the entrance as well as slaughter my squad of ten without even trying when *Poof* the entirety of the river became ice

TL;DR 65 invaders all decided to cross the river to my fortress but it froze while they were all in the water.",self,t5_2qyn1,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/1brrl0/most_unique_ending_to_a_siege_ive_ever_experienced/

The very first orders we received were foolish, straight from the green hell that was the surface.

That first column of stairs gave just a glimpse of what promised to be a profitable fortress. Most of the levels we passed were useless chert

At a respectable 25 levels below the surface we received the orders to begin excavating our new home. The walls were all of marble

The main level was slowly excavated, we knew every tree would be precious until we found the caverns and their precious fungiwood spores.

With the surface clearing

With essential mining done, two levels deep. A bit of fancy engineering ensured the pressure from such a column of water would not flood the fortress, and the river was breached. In moments the cistern filled and while not our first choice, we had access to water no matter the season.

From there our fortress progressed smoothly. We received many immigrants, although not immediate, success. When the mountainhome sent their first traders, we sent them home with hundreds of trinkets, useless here but easy to send home as show of wealth. Maybe that was our downfall.

Within a season we were besieged, had small chert block wall and a simple marble door to ward them off, and the wardogs left to pasture were sufficient to end the threat. We stowed the twice dead corpses below ground in a cave dug separate from our fortress, just in case. We should have known what was coming next, but we were foolish.

A few season passed and we continued to grow. A small force of twenty otherwise useless dwarfs were equipped with steel plate and battle axes and sent off to train against the future unknown.

When the next attack came, dwarfs, even necromancers were among them. In a panic, we were all ordered back to the fortress, but still we lost some to the hungry dead.

With the outer gates sealed, the militia commander was confident that twenty well armed dwarfs would be enough, even against 5 to 1 odds.

So twenty dwarfs assembled at the top of the stairs

While the militia commander was confident in his men, but they were ready.

Twenty fully armed and armored dwarfs are indeed a threat to wary of. Except these lazy bastards had spent all their days drinking and partying. None had faced real combat, foolhardy, militia rose and joined the ranks of the enemy.

With the failure of the militia the fortress stayed on alert, animate and crawling around. It played hell with the nerves of the civilians, who could see the thing every time they brought seeds to the farm or plants back. In the end, the main stairwell was abandoned. Walled off at the top and bottom of the fortress, with a new shaft dug in its place, it was a folly that should never have occurred.

The mayor in his wisdom decided that where a militia can fail an army could not. Steel production was doubled and new veins of metal ore and coal were breached. The bookkeeper probably saw it coming, there was only one option. Dig.

That same season we breached the caverns. The precious fungiwood spores rushed into the fortress and the caverns were resealed. Levels near the surface were quickly cleared to provide fertile ground for growth

A new militia was outfitted

The moment he finished, but could do no more. The beast finished the militia and climbed to the fortress proper.

I don't know why he did it

I am the last of them. Hiding in a corner, but I know they are coming for me.

I am not sane, my children. Soon I will roam these halls once again. Soon I will rise forever.

""Oooh look at the pretty graphics!"" 
""Oh my god they're adding three new spells/weapons/abilities!"" 
""Oh my god
""Oh my god

Oh my god: everything just stands in place and waits for shit to happen. 

Sure, but even games like Two Worlds Two got utterly boring towards the end of the swamp area an all the pretty graphics in the world weren't going to save it. I beat that game, went for a little wander around the world, realised that it wasn't as big and interesting as it looked and thought ""Well, that's that done."" 

The amount of work that went into the last DF update is bloody staggering! 
The random
Each new world with several hundred years of history, wage wars, found religions and political groups, defile temples and tombs, gain status, form relationships, breed, and on and on.
The fact that you can impact these worlds in hilarious and potentially significant ways.
The insane combat mechanics which rely on insane body maps with tissues and arteries and bones.
The fact that you're very much mortal in adventure more - you get stabbed in the face, and something will crossbow you from twenty feet away and there's no coming back from that. You lose a foot, or your hands, all your teeth, your tongue, or whatever: assuming you don't bleed t death, you're going to have a REALLY hard time continuing, until they get bitten a were-iguana three years later

I could go on
I don't rule out every new game that comes along
People tell me about new games coming out like they're really deep - Skyrim and Final Fantasy (insert number here) are a brilliant example - and I tend to think ""Meh.""

This is why games like Din's Curse, hook me for such a long time: the game does stuff when I'm not looking. If I sit around for a while, something else is happening. The AI doesn't wait around for my arse to saunter over to some idiot with a question mark over their heads, tell me some bollocks about an urgent mission, and if I return a year later say ""Oh thank god you were just in time"" - it just goes and destroys a bit of the world, or kills the NPCs family, or whatever.

The metals industry came online.  They had a substantial farm set up and started brewing and cooking.  There was plenty of rock for crafts to trade for stuff when the caravans showed up.  There was even sand

The geography of the area happened that the entrance to the fort was between two cliff faces, metal was still too strongly needed for armor and weapons) to make the other opening leading to their entrance a trapped path, ready to thin out any invading forces before they reached the meagre military.

The minotaur was no big deal.  The couple of ambushes were easily dispatched.

In a migrant wave came a dwarf who seemed suspiciously capable.  Investigation into his past discovered a vast array of previous citizenships.  A check of the teeth and yep... vampire.  

The dwarves' usual method of vampire disposal was to set them loose in the caverns and wall up behind them, he was given a set of halfway decent armor and a pick before being set loose and the entrance walled up behind him.  He dug down, level by level, dispatching any number of underground creepy-crawlies with a swift pick to the face, until, in the third cavern layer...

**You have discovered a curious underground structure**

As the dwarves knew, the vampire explorer would be able to safely enter the underground structure without risk.  This was an unprecedented opportunity for the dwarves.  He proceeded into the structure to find the treasure in the center.

Meanwhile

**A vile force of darkness has arrived**

The lever was pulled, behind the entrance, and they waited for the siege to break against their traps, and, failing that, to have their remnants mopped up by the military. 

Including the Voracious Cave Crawler mounts....  And the squad of War Cave Dragons...  And half dozen goblin weapon masters....  A total of **98** invaders.

It could be worse.  Possibly?  No

The first squads hit the traps.  And sprung them.  The second and third squads mostly made it through.  Then the cave dragons and cave crawlers walked right over them.  So did the fourth

The military was wiped out.  The goblin crossbow squad laid down a deadly barrage of bolts into the waiting military

The invaders spread through the fort

The combat made its way through the fortress until the creatures were cornered in the bedroom level.  More recruits fell

One-by-one the crawlers and dragons were struck down.  The price was horrible.  Bodies littered the halls and wounded dwarves lay incapacitated on the floors.  55 dwarves were left alive at the end of it.  The handful of dwarves who were conscious were incensed at the carnage and destruction and loss of fellow dwarves.  Fights broke out

Then the insanity started.  Dwarves were struck with melancholy, mad, running around and babbling amidst the destruction.  A recruit went berserk and started attacking anything and everything before being struck down himself.  Dwarves lying unconscious in the halls started dying of thirst and hunger from lack of anyone to care for them.  Tinworks was in its death throes.

*Except for the vampire explorer, adamantine scimitar.*

I was also afraid that it would drain the volcano low enough that I would not have magma access for my magma traps up top.

Then I came up with a stunningly simple solution. The cavern layer above this one had a large lake. I dug a channel from the lake to the tile directly above the breach.

Hi everyone

Don't want to wait for DT to be completely updated? I've patched together all of the memory offsets found on the bay12 forums by stevedore

The end result is that you will be able to view and edit your dwarves' assigned labours, but not mostly anything else. 

Note: I take no credit for any of the work whatsoever. I was going to start working on getting it up and running, there are already four or five C programmers working on it. If you want to praise anyone for their hard work, send stevedore, DwarfEngineer and dyn, on the bay12 forums, a thank you note :).

***
Anyways

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59858051/DT-TemporaryFix.zip
***
Instructions: 

1. Download the latest version of DT.
2. Merge the contents of the zip file with your DT installation folder.

1360195935.0,1816hs,"Long story, but because of you guys, I killed a dragon.",SlaveOne,111,36, but just because your sub exists.

So about two months ago, but even they get dull after I've done every quest in like two weeks. If you can believe it, r/dwarffortress was the last random sub I hit.

Last, and discussions on how best to build their fortress. I was more than intrigued. To the point that after watching y'all talk for a month, I downloaded the game.

I think it took me this last month to just survive. I spent my first weekend doing nothing but watch online tutorials. Then another week reading the wiki, we all know the learning curve.

Fast forward to just now. I finally figured out how to embark right, built some drawbridges, and cut myself off from the world. I spent about the last three years watching migrants and traders get slaughtered by goblins that were just sitting outside the fort. They finally left, so I went out and began the process of claiming a giant pile of items they didn't seem to care about.

Enter the dragon.

I didn't actually get my bridges up for every ambush, I only ever replaced one of them, bring my total military up to a whopping 5. I'm thinking, ""Holy shit, I need to get that bridge raised now or I'm dead.""

Cancelled every job, ""Fuck."" Keep in mind, I've never seen a dragon before. This is my first encounter with anything bigger than a goblin or thief.

Then it starts blowing fire.

What the fuck. 

I watch my livestock fry, I've called in The Lucky Tours. All I'm thinking is, ""Well, I guess that was fun. I'll just have to be more prepared next time.

Then, and starts letting off shots. Suddenly, I'm like, ""Wait, are they going to win this?""

Bam! Giant red D on the field and my dwarves headed back to the fort like it's no big thing. It never occured to me that they've been hanging out in their barracks and training room for the past three years doing nothing but getting ready for this moment. I seriously was so pumped

Thanks for making this sub

Alright

It's like these necromancers believe they're the last remnants of enlightened and literate civilization in a vast dark age

Turned out to be a ""Her"": Aleya Ruyavamelara (Aleya Lobstergroup).

And I'm all ""Sweet

In the meantime

After a while I decide I want to feed her some goblins

Turns out she's a pretty good fighter

After she's done and gotten a new name suffix (the fresh hold) from breaking a bunch of their scrawny ankles apparently

As I'm waiting for my dwarfs to (d)ump a literal mountainside worth of stone down the volcano's lava tube

Now I'm imagining her as a kinda tough but cutesy anime-style catgirl, following my dedicated horde of cooks.

All this time

And then it hit me, it takes me from being a simple player to being a co-storyteller alongside Toady's game engine. I recall that [Extra Credits did a segment on this amazing aspect of good games](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/extra-credits/3555-The-Role-of-the-Player) and then I recalled the same thing happening back in the day during my first runthrough of The Bards Tale. 

It's not about graphics

This is why DF is epic

The guards went into a homicidal rage. My legendary wrestlers strolled into the killing field in trances and tore everyone apart. Limbs were flying. The goblins who tried to run were chased down and thrown off of cliffs. 

The siege was broken

Suddenly

Suddenly, ""he must be taking it to the graveyard.""

Nope.

He claimed a tanner's shop. He started a mysterious construction.

He made a dwarf skin toga. From the skin of what was possibly one of his closest friends.

He put it on and went about his day.

""A human diplomat has left unhappy.""

Too late, they did it. While I wasn't looking, dwarves elected Urist McSchiavo to public office. While I understand the appeal of a brain-dead politician, they don't make good negotiators.

Recently I built a bunch of adamantine weapons to boost my fortresses wealth and it evidently attracted the local goblin law-giver

I had already fought off a similar siege in the past, now wielding adamantine axes quickly destroyed the goblins, but then spent a couple days fighting the demon king.

Not only did this demon king breathe fire that my dwarves had to constantly block with their adamantine shields

Looking back through the logs it looks like my dwarves managed to bruise the demon king until it dropped one of its gloves

The triumphant dwarf who landed the killing blow promptly renamed the steel axe she was attached to.  As my dwarves got to work cleaning up the massacre an announcement window popped up saying that the world had entered the golden age.

I looked it up on the wiki and this apparently means that the civilizations are expanding without or with very little warfare. Has anyone else had this happen before?  As I have never killed a goblin demon king before what happens now?  Will the goblins never come again?

If so it might be fairly boring

**Edit: Screenshots are now attached**

How I conquered the HFS:

The attack center had a long one tile wide hallway with green glass doors and masterpiece spike traps, so they weren't too weakened by the time they got to my dwarves.  It was a very close battle, especially since my military commander got hit in the guts and spent most the time puking.

The military dwarves were put in that narrow corridor behind the six doors that sealed off the rest of the fortress.  The downward stairway leads to the pipe through the magma.  My dwarves already cleaned away the bodies, but they all survived.  It took almost a full year to get all the 10k weight demon corpses up the steps into the refuse heaps in my obsidian cast fortress tower:

Here is what an admantine pipe looks like

Here is the aftermath of the goblin demon king's seige.  It will take another few seasons to get all the crap and body parts cleaned up:

I cast another level onto the tower specifically to hold all the body parts.  It looks like I'll need another two or three levels though:

The demon king's corpse is just to the right of the yellow X cursor in the above screenshot.  Here are its stats.  Notice its weight.  It took about a week for one of the poor dwarves to haul it up to the top of the tower.
