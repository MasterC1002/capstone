HOW MOSES GOT THE 10 COMMANDMENTS

&gt;&gt; God went to the Arabs and said
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments for you that will make your lives better.'
&gt;&gt; The Arabs asked
&gt;&gt; And the Lord said
&gt;&gt; 'Can you give us an example?'
&gt;&gt; 'Thou shall not kill.'
&gt;&gt; 'Not kill? We're not interested..'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So He went to the Blacks and said
&gt;&gt; The Blacks wanted an example
&gt;&gt; 'Honour thy Father and Mother.'
&gt;&gt; 'Father? We don't know who our fathers are.
&gt;&gt; We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then He went to the Mexicans and said
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments.'
&gt;&gt; The Mexicans also wanted an example
&gt;&gt; 'Thou shall not steal.'
&gt;&gt; 'Not steal? We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then He went to the French and said
&gt;&gt; 'I have Commandments.'
&gt;&gt; The French too wanted an example and the Lord said
&gt;&gt; shall not commit adultery.'
&gt;&gt; 'Sacre bleu!!! Not commit adultery? We're not interested.'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally
&gt;&gt;  I have Commandments..'
&gt;&gt; 'Commandments?' They said
&gt;&gt; 'They're free.'
&gt;&gt; 'We'll take 10.'

Last week,' and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. 

It seemed a little strange.

When the busboy brought our water and utensils

Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets. When the waiter came back to serve our soup I inquired

""Well, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""

As luck would have it

I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly.

Looking around, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""

""Oh

""That consulting firm I mentioned also learned that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of our you-know-what

and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out,  “Happy Birthday.”  I thought, Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... they'll remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office

As I walked into my office,  and by the way ""Happy Birthday!""  I felt a little better... at least someone had remembered.

I buried myself in work,  ""You know Boss, It's such a nice day outside, and it is your birthday... what do you say I take you out to lunch, just you and me, my treat.""   I said,  ""Why thank you Jane, let's go!""

We didn't go to the busy deli where I usually go to grab a quick lunch. She chose instead a quiet little dimly lit bistro, talking, and enjoying a fine meal, not to mention each others company. It was turning out to be one of the best birthdays I could remember! On the way back to the office, Jane said,  ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... we don't need to go straight back to the office,  ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?""   She said

After arriving at her apartment, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment... I'll be right back.""   ""OK.""  I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a few minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake, with lit candles. Following her were my wife, my kids, my co-workers, all singing  ""Happy Birthday"".

And I just sat there.... On the couch... Naked.

invite all of his buddies and neighbors.

He also invited Leroy
He held the party around the pool in the back yard of his mansion.

Leroy was having a good time drinking, oysters
and BBQ and flirting with all the women.

At the height of the party

The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.
Everyone turned around and saw Leroy in the pool.

Leroy was fighting the gator and kicking its rear.  Leroy was jabbing
it in the eyes with his thumbs
holds
like some kind of Judo Instructor.

The water was churning and splashing everywhere. Both Leroy and the
gator were screaming and raising hell.

Finally Leroy strangled the gator and let it float to the top like a
dime store goldfish.

Leroy then slowly climbed out of the pool.  Everybody was just staring
at him in disbelief.

Finally the host says, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.”

“No

The rich man said
How about half a million bucks then?”

“No thanks

The host said
amazing. How about a new Porsche and a Rolex and some stock options?”

Again Leroy said no.

An atheist was walking through the woods.

'What majestic trees!'
'What powerful rivers!'
'What beautiful animals!'
He said to himself.


As he was walking alongside the river


He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him. 

He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder &amp; saw that the bear was closing in on him.

He looked over his shoulder again


He tripped &amp; fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him
 


At that instant moment
'Oh my God!'

Time stopped.
The bear froze.
The forest was silent.

As a bright light shone upon the man

'You deny my existence for all these years

'Am I to count you as a believer?'

The atheist looked directly into the light

'Very well

You definitely need to read the statement by Jay. Oh so true.

Those of You Born 
1930 - 1979
 

At the end of this email is a quote of the month by Jay Leno. If you don't read anything else
TO ALL THE KIDS WHO SURVIVED THE 
1930's, 60's and 70's!
 

First
 

They took aspirin
 

Then after that trauma
 

We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles
 

As infants &amp; children, no seat belts, no air bags, bald tires and sometimes no brakes.
 

Riding in the back of a pick-up truck on a warm day was always a special treat. 

We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. 


We shared one soft drink with four friends


We ate cupcakes, we weren't overweight. 
WHY? 


Because we were always outside playing...that's why! 


We would leave home in the morning and play all day


No one was able to reach us all day. And


We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps. And then ride them down the hill


We did not have Playstations,  no video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or CD's,  no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet and no chat rooms. WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them! 


We fell out of trees


We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt


We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, we did not put out very many eyes. 


We rode bikes or walked to a friend'shouse and 
knocked on the door or rang the bell
walked in and talked to them. 


Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment.  Imagine that!! 


The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of.  They actually sided with the law! 


These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers


The past 50 years Have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, and we learned how to deal with it all. 


If YOU are one of them? CONGRATULATIONS!
You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids
lawyers and the government regulated so much of our lives for our own good. 


While you are at it


Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors


The quote of the month is by Jay Leno:
""With hurricanes, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms 
tearing up the country from one end to another
and with the threat of swine flu and terrorist attacks.  Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?'


For those that prefer to think that God is not watching over us.. ..go ahead and delete this. 


For the rest of us...pass this on. 
A Small Prayer! 


God determines who walks into your life.....it's up to you to decide who you let walk away


I need this back. If you'll do this for me


When there is nothing left but God


Father
God bless my friend in whatever it is that You know they may need this day!
And may their life be full of your peace
Amen. 


Then send it on to five other people

 Yesterday I was at my local Kroger buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet
What did she think I had an elephant?
So because I'm retired and have little to do, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.
I told her that it was essentially a Perfect Diet and that the way that it works is
Horrified, I stopped to Pee on a Fire Hydrant and a car hit me.
I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was Laughing so hard.
 
Kroger won't let me shop there anymore. Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the World to think of crazy things to say. Forward this (especially) to all your retired friends...it will be their laugh for the day!

she feels about the social welfare big government state that she's being forced to live in! These solutions are 
just common sense in her opinion.

        PUT ME IN CHARGE.

        Put me in charge of food stamps. I'd get rid of Lone Star cards; no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho's
just money for 50-pound bags of rice and beans
away. If you want steak and frozen pizza

        Put me in charge of Medicaid. The first thing I'd do is to get women Norplant birth control implants or 
tubal ligations. Then, and nicotine. If you want to reproduce or use 
drugs, then get a job. 

        Put me in charge of government housing. Ever live in a military barracks? You will maintain our property 
in a clean and good state of repair. Your home will be subject to inspections anytime and possessions will 
be inventoried. If you want a plasma TV or Xbox 360

        In addition
job. It may be cleaning the roadways of trash
We will sell your 22-inch rims and low profile tires and your blasting stereo and speakers and put that money 
toward the ""common good."" 

        Before you write that I've violated someone's rights
 our money
consider that it wasn't that long ago that taking someone else's money for doing absolutely nothing was 
demeaning and lowered self esteem. 

        If we are expected to pay for other people's mistakes we should at least attempt to make them learn 
from their bad choices. The current system rewards them for continuing to make bad choices.

A carrot
A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved
Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots

In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. 

Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her daughter

""Carrots,"" she replied. 

Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell

Finally, ""What does it mean, mother?"" 

Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity: boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its insides became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water. 
""Which are you?"" she asked her daughter. ""When adversity knocks on your door

Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong

Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart? 

Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? 

May you have enough happiness to make you sweet

The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the best of everything that comes along their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. 

When you were born

Live your life so at the end

Instead of giving the answer, and asked them to decide for themselves whether 'computer' should be a  masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.
 
The men's group decided that 'computer' should definitely be of the feminine gender ('la computadora')

1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;

2. The native language they use to  communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;

3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and

4. As soon as you make a commitment to  one
 
(THIS GETS  BETTER!)

The women's group, because: 
 
1. In order to do anything with them

2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;

3. They are supposed to help you solve problems

A very good article which takes two minutes to read. Heart Attacks And Drinking Warm Water

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your meal, maybe it is time we adopt their drinking habit while eating.

For those who like to drink cold water, it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats and lead to cancer. It is best to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal.

Common Symptoms Of Heart Attack...

A serious note about heart attacks - You! should know that not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting . Be aware of intense pain in the jaw line.
You may never have the first chest pain during the course of a heart attack. Nausea and intense sweating are also common symptoms. 60% of people who have a heart attack while they are asleep do not wake up. Pain in the jaw can wake you from a sound sleep.

years to get it right and it is broke.

b. Social Security was established in 1935. You have had 74 years to
get it right and it is broke.

c. Fannie Mae was established in 1938. You have had 71 years to get
it right and it is broke.

d. War on Poverty started in 1964. You have had 45 years to get it
right; $1 trillion of our money is confiscated each year and transferred to
""the poor"" and they only want more.

e. Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965. You have had 44
years to get it right and they are broke.

f. Freddie Mac was established in 1970. You have had 39 years to get
it right and it is broke.

g. The Department of Energy was created in 1977 to lessen our
dependence on foreign oil. It has ballooned to 16
$24 billion a year and we import more oil than ever before. You had 32 years to get
it right and it is an abysmal failure.

You have FAILED in every ""government service"" you have shoved down our
throats while overspending our tax dollars.

AND YOU WANT AMERICANS TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED
WITH A GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM??

Folks
up in the e-mails of some of our ""duly elected' (they never read anything)
and their staff will clue them in on how Americans feel.

AND

I know what's wrong. We have lost our minds to ""Political Correctness""
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Someone please tell me what is wrong with all the people that
run this country!!!!!!

We're ""broke"" and can't help our own Seniors, Homeless
etc. and the last months we have provided aid to Haiti
Pakistan ( the previous home of bin Laden). literally

Our retired seniors living on a 'fixed income' receive no aid nor do
they get any breaks.

AMERICA: a country where we have homeless without shelter
going to bed hungry
without treatment

Imagine if the GOVERNMENT gave U. S. the same support they give to
other countries. Sad isn't it?

DEAR DESPERATE

First keep in mind
Husband 1.0 is an Operating System.

Please enter command: ithoughtyoulovedme.html and try to download Tears

application works as designed
the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.But remember
the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence
2.5

Please note that Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the
Snoring Loudly Beta. Whatever you do
(it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of
all your system resources.) Also do not attempt to reinstall Boyfriend
5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

&gt; It didn't. I was playing golf with it at the time.

I'm not the type to start a conversation in the public toilet but I don't know what got into me,

Hi Sweetheart

I am sorry about getting into an argument about putting up the Christmas lights.  I guess that sometimes I feel like you are pushing me too hard when you want something.  I realize that I was wrong and I am apologizing for being such a hard-headed guy.  All I want is for you to be happy and be able to enjoy the holiday season.  Nothing brightens the Christmas spirit like Christmas lights!  I took the time to hang the lights for you today; and now I will be off to the hockey rink. 

Again

Love you……

Her response -  
Hi Honey
  
Thank you for that heart-felt apology.  I don't often get an apology from you, felt bad about the argument and wanted to apologize.  I realize that I can sometimes be a little pushy.  I will try to respect your feelings from now on.  Thank you for taking the time to hang the Christmas lights for me.  It really means a lot.  In the spirit of giving, I washed your truck for you; and now I am off to the mall. 

I love you too!

The lawyer is thinking that seniors are so dumb that he could get one over on them easily.

So

The senior is tired and just wants to take a nap

The lawyer persists, you pay me only $5.00. Then you ask me one, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00,"" he says.

This catches the senior's attention and

The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the Earth to the Moon?""

The senior doesn't say a word, and hands it to the lawyer.

Now, and comes down with four?""

The lawyer uses his laptop to search all references he can find on the Net.

He sends E-mails to all the smart friends he knows; all to no avail. After an hour of searching

He wakes the senior and hands him $500.00. The senior pockets the $500.00 and goes right back to sleep.

The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the senior up and asks

The senior reaches into his pocket



You know you're going to send this one on.

During my second month of college

Gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student

 
 
And had breezed through the questions until I read

The last one:


""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?""

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the 

Cleaning woman several times. She was tall

Dark-haired and in her 50's



I handed in my paper

Blank. Just before class ended

The last question would count toward our quiz grade.



""Absolutely

You will meet many people.  All are significant. They

Deserve your attention and care

Is smile and say ""hello.""



I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her

Name was Dorothy. 



2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain 



One night

Woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway

Trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had

Broken down and she desperately needed a ride.

Soaking wet

A young white man stopped to help her

Unheard of in those conflict-filled 19 60's.. The man

Took her to safety

Put her into a taxicab.



She seemed to be in a big hurry

Address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a

Knock came on the man's door. To his surprise

Giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 

Special note was attached.



It read:

""Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway

The other night. The rain drenched not only my

Clothes

Because of you

Husband's' bedside just before he passed away... God

Bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving

Others.""



Sincerely

Mrs. Nat King Cole. 



3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those

Who serve. 



In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less

A 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and

Sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in 

Front of him.



""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. 

""Fifty cents



The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and

Studied the coins in it.



""Well



By now more people were waiting for a table and the

Waitress was growing impatient. 



""Thirty-five cents



The little boy again counted his coins.



""I'll have the plain ice cream



The waitress brought the ice cream

The table and walked away The boy finished the ice

Cream

Came back

Table.  There

Were two nickels and five pennies..



You see

To have enough left to leave her a tip. 



4 - Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our Path. 



In ancient times

Roadway..  Then he hid himself and watched to see if

Anyone would remove the huge rock.  Some of the

King's' wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by 

And simply walked around it.  Many loudly blamed the

King for not keeping the roads clear

Anything about getting the stone out of the way.



Then a peasant came along carrying a load of 

Vegetables.  Upon approaching the boulder

peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the

stone to the side of the road.  After much pushing

and straining

peasant picked up his load of vegetables

a purse lying in the road where the boulder had

been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note

from the King indicating that the gold was for the 

person who removed the boulder from the roadway.  The

peasant learned what many of us never understand!



Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve

our condition. 



5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.. 



Many years ago

hospital

was suffering from a rare &amp; serious disease.  Her only

chance of recovery appeared to be a blood

transfusion from her 5-year old brother

miraculously survived the same disease and had 

developed the antibodies needed to combat the

illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her

little brother

be willing to give his blood to his sister. 



I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a

deep breath and saying

her.""  As the transfusion progressed

next to his sister and smiled

the color returning to her cheek. Then his face

grew pale and his smile faded.



He looked up at the doctor and asked with a

trembling voice



Being young

doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his

sister all of his blood in order to save her.. 



Now you have 2 choices. 



1 Delete this email

2. Forward it other people. 

I hope that you will choose No. 2 and remember. 



Most importantly..... ""Work like you

don't need the money

&gt; &gt; SOMETHING
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TO THINK ABOUT!!!!! 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Recently
&gt; &gt; in large French city
&gt; &gt; tanned woman appeared 
&gt; &gt; in the window of a gym. It said:
&gt; &gt;  ¨THIS SUMMER DO YOU WANT TO BE A 
&gt; &gt; MERMAID OR A WHALE?¨
&gt; &gt;  A middle aged woman
&gt; &gt; characteristics did not match those of the woman on the
&gt; &gt; poster
&gt; &gt; publicly to the question posed by the gym. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  To 
&gt; &gt; Whom It May Concern:
&gt; &gt;  Whales are always surrounded by friends 
&gt; &gt; (dolphins
&gt; &gt; sex life
&gt; &gt; pregnant and have adorable baby whales. They have a
&gt; &gt; wonderful time with dolphins 
&gt; &gt; stuffing themselves with shrimp. They play and swim in the
&gt; &gt; seas
&gt; &gt; wonderful places like Patagonia
&gt; &gt; coral reefs of Polynesia 
&gt; &gt; . Whales are wonderful singers and have even recorded CDs.
&gt; &gt; They are incredible 
&gt; &gt; creatures and virtually have no predators other than
&gt; &gt; humans. They are loved
&gt; &gt; protected and admired by almost everyone in the world.
&gt; &gt;  Mermaids don’t 
&gt; &gt; exist. If they did exist
&gt; &gt; the offices of 
&gt; &gt; Argentinean psychoanalysts due to identity crisis. Fish or
&gt; &gt; human? They don’t 
&gt; &gt; have a sex life because they kill men who get close to them
&gt; &gt; not to mention how 
&gt; &gt; could they have sex? Therefore they don’t have kids
&gt; &gt; either. Not to mention who 
&gt; &gt; wants to get close to a girl who smells like a fish store?
&gt; &gt;  The choice 
&gt; &gt; is perfectly clear to me; I want to be a whale.
&gt; &gt;  P.S. We are in an age 
&gt; &gt; when media puts into our heads the idea that only skinny
&gt; &gt; people are beautiful
&gt; &gt; but I prefer to enjoy an ice cream with my kids
&gt; &gt; dinner with a man who 
&gt; &gt; makes me shiver and a coffee with my friends. With time we
&gt; &gt; gain weight because 
&gt; &gt; we accumulate so&gt; much information and wisdom in our

I was in my neighborhood restaurant this morning and was seated behind a group of jubilant individuals celebrating the ... successful passing of the recent health care bill. I could not finish my breakfast. This is what ensued:

They were a diverse group of several races and both sexes. I heard the young man exclaim, he is healing the sick.” The young woman enthusiastically proclaimed, “Yeah, and he does it for free. I cannot believe anyone would think that a free market would work for health care. Another said, ‘The stupid Republicans want us all to starve to death so they can inherit all of the power. Obama should be made a Saint for what he did for those of us less fortunate.” At this, I had more than enough.

I arose from my seat, smiled as best I could and began an experiment.

“I would like to give one of you my house. It will cost you no money and I will pay all of the expenses and taxes for as long as you live there. Anyone interested?” They looked at each other in astonishment. “Why would you do something like that?” asked a young man, I will give you my house for free, no money what so ever. Anyone interested?” In unison, a resounding “Hell Yeah” fills the room.

“Since there are too many of you, they looked at one another, an expression of bewilderment on their faces. The perky young woman asked, “What are the rules?” I smiled and said, “I don’t know. I have not yet defined them. However, it is a free home that I offer you.” They giggled amongst themselves, the youngest of which said, old man.” I smiled and leaned into the table a bit further. “I am serious

“I’ll take it you old fool. Where are the keys?” boasted the youngest among them. “Then I presume you accept ALL of my terms then?” I asked.. The elderly couple seemed amused and entertained as they watched from the privacy of their table. “Oh hell yeah! Where do I sign up?” I took a napkin and wrote, so long as he accepts and abides by the terms that I shall set forth upon consummation of this transaction.” I signed it and handed it to the young man who eagerly scratched out his signature. “Where are the keys to my new house?” he asked in a mocking tone of voice. All eyes were upon us as I stepped back from the table, pulling the keys from pocket and dangling them before the excited new homeowner.

“Now that we have entered into this binding contract, no matter the nature. Your morals and principles shall be as mine. You will vote as I do, think as I do and do it with blind faith. These are my terms. Here are your keys.” I reached the keys forward and the young man looked at me dumbfounded.

“Are you out of your mind? Who would ever agree to those ridiculous terms?” the young man appeared irritated. “You did when you signed this contract before reading it, as witnessed by all of your friends; you cannot get out of the deal unless I agree to it. I do not intend to let you free now that I have you ensnared. I am the power you agreed to. I am the one you blindly and without thought chose to enslave yourself to. In short, I am your Master.” At this, the table of celebrating individuals became a unified group against the unfairness of the deal.

After a few moments of unrepeatable comments and slurs, it is not freedom.” With that, I tore up the napkin and placed it before the astonished young man. “This is the nature of your new health care legislation.”

I turned away to leave these few in thought and contemplation and was surprised by applause. The elderly gentleman, “Thank you Sir, these kids don’t understand Liberty these days.” He refused to allow me to pay my bill as he said, “You earned this one, it is an honor to pickup the tab.” I shook his hand in thanks, leaving the restaurant somewhat humbled, and sensing a glimmer of hope for my beloved country.

The light turned yellow, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection. 

The tailgating woman was furious and honked her horn, and her cell phone and makeup. 

As she was still ranting

He took her to the police station where she was searched, and placed in a holding cell.

After a couple of hours

He said, flipping off the guy in front of you and cussing a blue streak at him.  I noticed the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'Follow Me to Sunday-School' bumper sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk, so naturally....I assumed you had stolen the car.""

&gt;""Demonstrate your skills!"" commanded the Emperor.

&gt;The Japanese samurai stepped forward, neatly divided in two!

&gt;""That is skill!"" nodded the Emperor.
 
&gt;""How are you going to top that

&gt;The Jewish samurai, opened a tiny box releasing one fly, drew his samurai sword and *Swoooooosh! * flourished his sword so mightily that a gust of wind blew through the room. But the fly was still buzzing around! In disappointment, the Emperor said, ""What kind of skill is that? The fly isn't even dead.""

photo op and she's sitting on his knee. She's supposed to be dead

And then they have her parents interviewed. It shows that they're all actors. It
never really happened

he's called up in front of the camera. He's off to the left. Then he's called to the
center
Sandy Hook and about his daughter. And he goes from on the side from laughing and
joking with everybody
smiling face off and you can see him physically trying to force his face to look sad
and then he starts talking about how his daughter's been killed. They're actors.
There were no bodies. 

It was a made for TV drama to try to ram through the gun control laws
want to kill the American people and they can't kill armed people. That's why Hitler
disarmed the Germans
disarmed the Chinese and they killed between them something like 120 million of
their own people. And that's what they want to do in America and they can't do it
because the people have the Second Amendment and they have guns. So they have to do
all of this
which are made for television
give up their guns. And then they'll start killing the Americans. Because the
Americans are the only people stopping them from doing what they want to do already.
They know they can't put their next phase
they can't put that phase into operation whilst the Americans have got millions of
guns. ",self,t5_2t776,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/16iift/fw_fwd_sandy_hook_shooting_didnt_happen_proof/
