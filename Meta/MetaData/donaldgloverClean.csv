JonnyCams	104	17	82	"First and foremost Donald put on a spectacular show, awesome visuals, light/strobe show and the set list (which I think was leaked on here last week) was really great.

But, that was one terrible crowd. 

* Full of underage bro's who were loud and annoying.
* One group of assholes got in a fight with the opener, Danny Brown. They threw a water bottle back at him and it seemed like they were heckling and flicking him off. It got to the point that Danny went into the crowd ready to box. Then he left the stage shouting, ""fuck you!""
* People were singing louder than Donald. It got to the point where people started singing during an intro to a song. The song started and the band was about 8 counts behind the crowd. Instead of the crowd stopping and listening to the act they paid to see, the whole band missed a lyric/line and caught up the the crowd.


tldr: Why would you pay for a show if you are just going to heckle and bitch at the opener and sing louder than the headlining act? Should of stayed home and listened to itunes with your bros. Thanks for listening. &lt;/rant&gt;"	t5_2scgk	True

As of yet, there has been no such track. I was wondering if maybe there were any talented Hoodie fans in here who could whip up a mashup of Hoodie and Gambino. In my mind I was mixing ""Bonfire"" and ""The Chase Is On"", but obviously you can do whichever two (or more) songs you think go best together. 

Some examples of Hoodie Allen for those that do not know of him: [The Chase Is On](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZunGEL-jD-Y) [Tighten Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVM7T8AN9EM) [Can't Hold Me Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SMbpo9eF3I)

I understand at face-value all of it. But here's the thing, what is a witches' brew? A potion. Which rhymes with the next couplet of potent and motion.

I understand the potion/potent rhyme is pretty weak, but for that matter potent and motion is similarly weak because potion and motion are correct rhymes.

I don't like talking...stand up‚Äôs different. More like I don't like explaining. I never feel like I'm saying what I wanna say or how I feel. I‚Äôm sure even parts of this will be quoted and taken out of context. And people will be mad or talk shit but won‚Äôt read the whole thing cause, honestly, we‚Äôre all busy. I get it tho. I think a lot people think I'm just doing shit to do shit. In a way, that‚Äôs true. But I like making things. I wanna do things well. I'm learning music theory, and taking lessons. Learning languages so I can write in other languages. I love making stuff. I really do. 

My boy Kendrick gives me props which is a really cool thing to do. Doesn't need to do that at all, but he does cause he's a good person. He shouted me out at Coachella for making the beat for ""Look out for Detox"" and I when I rapped over the beat at Coachella to bring him out, I saw people write ""Childish, rips off Kendrick song"". Not in comment sections where people say shit all the time, like in actual articles. Like journalists. Writers. It was weird. I was in the studio with ‚ÄúB‚Äù and he was like ""all the stuff on the internet about music, comedy, art, etc. is like parents watching children play on a playground and being like 'look at Susie sliding on that slide...what an idiot'"" 

I can't sit down and talk to everyone about my beliefs, views, and intentions. I honestly would if I could. Also see a lot of white peeps coming to the ‚Äúdefense‚Äù of black peeps because they think I don't like black people or myself, I guess? I really don't get that. I don‚Äôt like that. I've also seen people act like they know me. Talk about how I grew up and my shit is perfect. And it's true. I‚Äôm lucky. My parents were always there and were supportive for the shit I wanted to do. It's dope. but I'm from Decatur GA. Like, ‚ÄúThe DEC‚Äù. In the projects. Moved to Stone Mountain later. My first recital was in South Dekalb Mall. I lived on my grandma's couch in the Bronx trying to pay her back for college. Me, my father, my mother, my two sisters, and (at the time) 3 brothers split one bedroom for a while. It feels like some sorta weird white overcompensation. Like when hipsters are like ""Guess what‚Ä¶I hate Obama! That's how unique I am"". Like that Trayvon Martin line in EYV. I saw some white peeps get upset. Which was a little funny to me cause it felt like no one cared about Oscar Grant or Kenneth Chamberlain or any of the other black kids shot in ATL or anywhere else when that shit happened. I'm the one getting texts from my mom every time that shit happens. And that shit happens a lot. Also, it wasn't a joke. It was worldplay to highlight something that I thought was unfair. But, if it was a joke, I get to do that. Cause that could've been me. I'm a black dude. I've had bullets whiz by me cause I look like me. I get to deal with it the way I wanna deal. Cause it's my deal. 

People will hate me/ my shit, but post my shit cause they want the web hits, cuz fans follow it. And I'm really lucky to have fans like that Mattafact, I wanna say thank you to fans. You guys are really the reason I'm even here or able to do this stuff. I'm not bullshitting around. I don't think I'm the best. I don't think being the best comes from having a lot of money or saying ""I'm the best"" all the time. But I'm also not looking to be ""some dude"". I don't do anything hoping to end it with being ""some dude"". I don't think anyone person on earth should strive to be ""just some dude"". I don't wanna be that. Or a coward. Those are the worst things you could be. Childish Gambino started as an inside joke that grew way faster than I ever thought it could. When people come up to me and are like ""this got me through chemo"" or ""I came out to my parents"" off of Childish, I almost feel guilty. Shit started as a joke, fun between writing with family and friends.  But I kinda don't have that scapegoat anymore...and I‚Äôm good with that. Word. Here's a start: http://www.iamdonald.com

1341497243.0	w2s0g	To all of the people comparing Royalty to Gambino's previous projects	Chowface	37	12	26	"These are just some of my thoughts regarding the complaints about Royalty.
Yes the album was different from Culdesac, Camp, and EP, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
The way I see it Culdesac was the avenue he went through to really experiment with this new thing he was stepping into, and for being only his third mixtape it was really good but still had room for improvement.
Then EP came out and every single one of those songs was fantastic and sort of made that unique Gambino style rap.
Camp though is where we truly got to see him evolve as an artist. In this album, you could tell by his tone, his verses, and the little, subtle things found in so many lines, that his flow had changed.
This brings us to Royalty. I think Royalty is just the next step in his evolution as an artist. I think most of the songs still maintained his uniqueness. Sure it was different from his previous albums, but it was a change I was expecting with songs like Backpackers and You See Me.
In all of these previous albums there were those lines where you were like, ""Woah, that was really cool, what he did there."" You still get that with Royalty. He still has really deep songs on this mixtape too. We Ain't Them and Shoulda Known, for starters do maintain the same kind of deepness we saw in Camp.
I have followed Childish Gambino since before he released EP and I have to say, as a fan it has been an amazing experience watching him grow from an artist with all of this raw talent but little experience, into the complex artist we see today. No other artist has given me the same sense of involvement. Though Drake came somewhat close with his latest album.
I don't look at this mixtape and compare it to Camp, EP, or Culdesac because it's not the same. It's not meant to be the same. His previous ablums were never meant to be the same as the last, but a reflection of his style as he grows as an artist.
Listen to Royalty again without comparing it to anything else, because it shouldn't be compared. That's what makes Royalty so classically Gambino. It's not the same. It's not better or worse. It's simply different.

tldr; Royalty is not Camp, EP, or Culdesac. Don't make the mistake of comparing them."	t5_2scgk	True

YouGuysINeverCry	28	8	55	"So as the title says, I don't want this subreddit to die so I just wanted to make a text post. And hopefully from the rumours I'm hearing, CG will be dropping something new soon so we'll have something to talk about!

I don't think I can choose a 'favourite' lyric but I do love two lyrics from Not Going Back, 
the part he says 'my lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis' just blew my mind, when I RapGeniused and found out the meaning, I was awestruck at the wordplay. What‚Äôs the opposite of Live Easy? Die Hard. The classic movie series starring Bruce Willis.

The other lyric that I really love is when he says, 'But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model'. 
I feel like he is referring to me and all the other Blerds out there in this, and I just see him as an awesome role model.

I've only been a Gambino fan or Goon for about a year, I loved Community and discovered that Troy from Community rapped when I was 16 (I'm 17 now). I am actually really NOT into rap, but I like really loved his music and oddly kind of started liking Kanye West because of him, I HATED all rap music before CG so it is unusual for me, .

Don't judge me on my pics, I haven't listened to all his stuff yet (I keep thinking that the next Cg song is the one I;m going to hate, but so far I've loved all of his songs (Bonfire and Freaks and Geeks are probably his best IMO), haven't listened to Royalty yet but don't have high hopes seeing as it it is full of features, I love CG for CG not others so nervous about listening to that.

Wow sorry this post is so long, just kept writing about CG, I love him so much and NO ONE I know knows about him or who he is, so it's cool that I can talk about him here. :) "	t5_2scgk	True

1323382175.0	n5edu	I love CG, and I love Camp, but...	SarahPalinisaMuslim	26	6	23	"when I first started listening to it, all I could think about was how it sounded overproduced. I just got it, so I weigh it a little differently since every album needs to be ""broken in"" and listened to a few times before I really like it. However, some songs just didn't sound like classic Gambino.

I don't mind when artists change, and I actually appreciate when they evolve. I'm not one who says ""Weezer was only good on the first album!"" But during the intros to a few songs, it didn't even sound like it was CG's voice. It sounded like any other generic rap artist.

I will probably feel different later on, but am I alone? I just love the way he came so hard on his mixtapes and the EP, and how it was basically just a beat and a voice most of the time. Maybe that's what comes with the territory of a record label, and maybe there's nothing wrong with it. But being different is what he's all about, and I really hope the label gave him creative control.

I mean honestly, he's established himself as a writer and has a professional background that shows he can assume creative control. If I were in charge, I'd let him do his thing. I just hope that's not what happened in this instance. I doubt he would allow it to happen.

Maybe I'm overreacting."	t5_2scgk	True

1340201482.0	vbu9f	Any questions for Donald? UPDATE		17	2	11	"Alright I have some good news and I have some bad news.  Bad news first.  
So the setting was a little less intimate than what I had been led to believe, ended up going to his tour-bus for the ""after-party"", where it was hard to get Donald attention and I was unable to ask him any questions, though I doubt I could have recalled them. I'm really sorry about that. Also Donald poured me a glass of Cranberry juice.  I still have the cup.
Good News:  Donald had the mixtape on in the bus and it was most dope.  I don't think there were any collaborations on it, and there are at least five more songs on it than what's been released.  I think there is more than what I heard from it as well.  One of his musicians got on the bus and Donald asked him if he had heard the new song that was playing, makes me think he's still writing and finishing stuff for it.
That's really all I can say about it I think, I'm really sorry for not asking your questions reddit.  Here's a story about me making an ass out of myself to try and make up for it:

It really feels like he is separating himself from the ""nerdy"" fanbase and even from his comedy background.

He played for an hour and 15 minutes, mostly camp, a few off Culdesac and two songs of EP (There was one song before the freestyle that i'm not sure what it was, I think it was from Poindexter).  From my personal experience it was very hard to see the stage (I'm 5' 8"") and the people in front of me were very tall.  Also Epic's layout is shitty.  Those pillars in the front are absolutely terrible.



Gambino was amazing.  He did do a freestyle and play a new song and ended with Lights Turned On.  The only thing that really ticked me off is the Lil Depressed Boy comic was ten bucks.  That is down right robbery for a comic.
