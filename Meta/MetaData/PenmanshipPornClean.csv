To my slight dismay, 80% of the posts here are all asking for handwriting tips. I'm happy people want to improve but I feel like it's a little off topic. There's another sub /r/Handwriting, that seems much better suited to that type of thing.

Is there any chance that perhaps the sub could move in a direction more fitting of it's name and perhaps try to redirect 'I need advice on my bad handwriting' to the aforementioned sub?"	t5_2v19p	True

http://imgur.com/a/K3wWx
OK, I've uploaded a selection of 10 samples to Imgur. I tried to focus specifically on very beautiful and legible script (most of the samples I have are beautiful in their own way, but much less legible!). At least one of them dates back to the late 1700s, with the most recent being around 1910 or so.
These letters are from the estate of my grandfather, Charles Eliot Norton II, grandson of Charles Eliot Norton. Most of the letters are to or from friends and relatives.
Note that I only scanned a single side of what was usually a folded card, so it isn't scanned for reading so much as for examples of handwriting. If there's enough interest, I can scan other (less formal) examples as well.


http://imgur.com/a/6hpbj
As promised, here are additional samples that are less legible but more interesting. A few notes:
The first two are receipts dating from 1802 for books, paper, and other supplies.
The next image contains two envelopes which are addressed to Eliot Norton care of William Darwin (son of Charles Darwin). Notice all they needed was a name and city and it got delivered!
The next letter is from Henry D. Minot, the naturalist, regarding some eggs and nests which were found by Eliot Norton.
The fifth letter is from Charles Eliot Norton to his daughter-in-law, Margaret.
The sixth and seventh items are in French, I believe from Julien Benda. I loved the address with the flourishing script!
This letter is from W.R. Emerson (?) to a young Eliot Norton, talking about accompanying his son ""Rafie"" as they storm the navy yard, obviously a bit of a game for children. It isn't dated, but my suspicion is that this was written by Ralph Waldo Emerson (who often went by his middle name). [Edit: Perusing the Wikipedia article I note that Emerson accompanied Charles Eliot Norton, Eliot's father, in April of 1873. This would put it around the right time, but I still can't verify for certain.]
I can't make out who this one is from, but it's dated Oct. 20, 1852. Note the casual script.
The final one is from George Henschel inviting Eliot Norton to a party to meet his ""chicken,"" Helen , and Wolfram Onslow Ford. Again, note the nice script on the envelope.
I hope you enjoy these. I had a lot of fun picking them out of the collection!"	t5_2v19p	True

Hello /r/PenmanshipPorn,

I just discovered you guys through [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/10qomv/well_this_is_beautiful/c6ftwtq) from [this front page submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/10qomv/well_this_is_beautiful/) and I just wanted to share that I think this place is amazing.

I had extremely poor handwriting (or penmanship ? Are the two terms interchangeable ?) as a child and I cringe whenever I look back at my old writings. But after a certain point in high school I suddenly improved and developed my own style of handwriting and I would often get comments/compliments from my friends saying my writing looks like a girl's writing, and I took pride in that. 

One time I even got some of my female friends to each write a sentence on a card and I put a card with my own writing in the stack and ask some of my other friends to pick a card with the best handwriting on it and my card was picked 9 out of 10 times and they were always surprised to find out I (a guy) was the one who wrote it !

Anyways, sorry for the long ramble. I just really appreciate good handwriting/penmanship. A few of my female friends have really good writing and I really enjoy it. And I'm glad that my girlfriend also has really neat and cute writing. (Maybe if I get a chance I can share their penmanship with you.) We are both perfectionists and sometimes erase and write the same word over and over again just so it looks good enough to us ! Even though it makes doing some things take longer but if I write quickly and messy, after a day or two I would still go back and rewrite that piece of writing.

Thank you for reading ! Happy to find a group on Reddit that shares this particular interest of mine.

P.S. I guess my interests in typography/graphic design, neat doodles, and organization are also related to this. (I'm a neat freak, too.)

P.P.S. Sorry if posts like these aren't allowed or this is considered irrelevant content.
