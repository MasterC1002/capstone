Just be careful, the music and the dancing is fun, but when dealing with drugs just please be as safe as possible. I did roll myself, and roll hard I did, but not with an absurd amount just to err on the side of caution.  Nothing hurts my heart more than to see someone get dragged away from a night that fun with music that beautiful.

I've been listening to EDM and going to shows for three years now, and as a dude raised with respect for ladies, this is the most confusing thing in the scene, to me.

we've all been there - you're pushed up in the crowd, trying to get weird to  the DJ's sick tunes, and a girly pushes her way up in front of you and starts dancing. she'll brush back against you while she sways to the music...

so, ladies, when is it appropriate for my hands to hit your hips and start the ridiculous process of grinding? I ask mainly because I just can't jab my cock into a strangers' back, yet I see girls who were dancing in front of me grinding up on dudes next to me.

so, should I try to ask to dance? am I missing a signal? or am I just supposed to jab my crotch into strangers' backs? I'm really quite kindhearted and it seems wrong, but, yanno, I'm down to dance some at shows.

I don't know, I guess I just feel like I should be asking these things, since I've never gotten a straight answer from girlies in the RL.

**edit**: okay, just to clarify a few things.

first, grinding is the wrong word. I'm just not a dancer, really, and that's what I've always been told, uh, 'dancing while standing in the spoon position' was called. I'll leave it intact, but mention that it's incorrect.

second, for those of you who mentioned the outright creepiness factor of my request, HOW THE FUCK DO *YOU* DEAL WITH A SEA OF PEOPLE MAKING CONSTANT PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH YOU? I did post this in motherfucking /r/EDM, right? there are literally people touching you at all times, and when you add in the occasional crowd-surfer, mosh-pit, drunk dude stumbling through people spilling his drink on you and entire sections of crowd almost falling down after losing their balance thanks to said drunk dude, it gets hectic. how the hell am I creepy for wondering if the girl in front of me wants to dance after shoving back into me several times? I don't *do* anything, I keep my distance and my hands up. that's how I rage it out. I just can't figure out a way to communicate in the deafening sweat pits that are EDM shows, hence, my post.

third, what fucking EDM shows are you going to where you can even have a conversation in the building with someone? I'm not talking about raves, I'm talking about shitty dubstep/trap/moonbah/whatever shows. the last show I went to, I could seriously feel the bass making the liquor in my stomach shake while outside smoking a cigarette. get that? I can barely hear a bartender shouting into my ear, much less a girlie who isn't facing me."	t5_2qm8v	True

I just need somewhere to rant about this. It's a bit hard to believe this attitude still exists. 

1. No, Daft Punk did not ""save"" EDM. Dance music is doing just fine on its own right now, thank you very much. Although admittedly there do seem to be a growing number of profiteering scoundrels getting in on the newfound popularity for a quick buck, the style, the method of creation, the music itself, doesn't need fixing. It's continually improving and evolving, sure, but not in the direction he suggests it is.

2. In fact, it would be very difficult to call Random Access Memories EDM. It's mostly jazz, soft rock, etc., as created by a group whose work has mainly been dance music. There's nothing remotely dance-y on the album.

3. No, electronic music has not been soulless up until now. 

I don't know. I just wish people would grow up and learn that their musical tastes aren't true or false, especially jounalists. This sort of closed-minded idiocy never fails to deliver.

however, i tried looking for ""similar arists"": http://www.last.fm/music/Krewella/+similar

and a lot of them arent that similar.

the main thing is the vocals, i think. a lot of edm doesnt have vocals.

what genre/subgenre is Krewella? what bands sound like them?

thanks :)

""**Daft Punk to Make TV Appearance**

Another rumor of a Daft Punk TV appearance has emerged. You may remember back when the Daft Punk ads were airing on SNL that the air was bussing with rumors that they would be appearing on the show. Well, it never happened but the rumor mill has fired back up again. Word is that Daft Punk will be appearing on The Colbert Report some time next week. Nobody knows in what capacity they will appear, but many are hoping for a live performance.

This rumor does seem a bit far-fetched but crazier things have happened!

[Here is a summary of the results.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15hwVoZtdvMzG_kx3b1xSWUazU5Zhj9Cm30RxomyqeRw/viewanalytics) This is not all the data I've got! I'll be analyzing my responses over the next few weeks, and I'll post the final results when that's done, but I thought everyone would be interested to see the summary right now.

As if I haven't asked enough of you guys - I created a follow-up question to this survey. You can discuss them here [or submit them here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1itThUiYlCyK6BuTKRFT4EyfODmc7g2NDNmJk4up_AgE/viewform) Feel free to answer whichever questions you have opinions on.

1. What is your geographic location?
2. What stereotypes (positive/negative) do you hear associated with EDM culture?
3. What similarities/differences do you observe between the EDM scene and other music scenes?
4. What surprises and doesn't surprise you about the results of this survey?
5. What does EDM mean to you?
6. Additional comments

Once again, thank you guys so much. Stay tuned for further results!"	t5_2qm8v	True

Nowadays, it seems 60% of the song you hear on pop radio incorporate some aspect of electronic music, be it a bass drop or simply a vocoder effect on the voice(think of taylor swifts ""trouble""). It doesnt matter if the artist makes hip-hop, pop, indie, rock, EVERYONE is using electro influences now and i love it.


i for one am really glad that our kind of music is finally being accepted on the radio, what do you guys think?

I love it. Everything about it. I started to dab in it around 3 years ago, and my love for it has only gotten stronger.

I just got confirmation that I'll be attending Digital Dreams Festival (www.digitaldreamsfest.ca) in Toronto, Canada with a few buddies. Keep in mind that I am a 16 year old male, as are my friends. I'm ecstatic to hit such a large event for my first time, but I constantly hear complaints about teenagers being pains in the ass and acting like idiots, bringing down the good times that others have. Besides basic common sense, how can I ensure that I will have a fun and safe time, while still raging to the music?

Any tips and do's/don'ts are appreciated. Thanks! :)"	t5_2qm8v	True

1370596108.0	1fuoym	Too much EDM?	CptnAwsm	30	7	41	"Perhaps it is the nature of EDM music sources to be scattered. The music is made digitally, and content is delivered easily across multiple digital platforms like youtube/soundcloud. But so many artists are using so many different outlets to put out their content that as an EDM fan, it becomes hard to stay up to date. Reddit is great for finding new or rare tracks, but still not comprehensive enough. Remixes of songs are another thing to keep up on, as well as other content that didn't previously exist such as live feeds of shows. 

So, is having millions of sources for EDM really beneficial if one wants to keep current? Would it be too ""mainstream"" to have a single hub of all EDM content? Im curious because I find myself signing up for all these platforms, but only sometimes getting the content I want- and having my inbox spammed in the process. Just curious on all your thoughts on this."	t5_2qm8v	True

My personal choice is that we continue on the road we are on, however please improve your ""Should I press spam on this?"" choice because there are some blogs that are passionately written and we shouldn't omit them from sharing their love with us all.

I am many of us have our favorite music blog or something similar in which we stay relevant with the music scene. As the live sets from this event become  available I am sure download links will appear, dissappear, become limitedly available, etc. etc. As we find good links with downloads, streams, live concert footage, and more I propose that we place them all here with relevant information. That is all.

1363553228.0	1ahe78	Looking for a Friend!! (upvote for visibility)	Alphawolfsquad	21	6	2	"Hey guys!
So yesterday I attended Trapfest in Denver, Colorado. I had a great time and I can imagine most everyone did! However, I met a guy named Daniel, and he seemed like a really nice guy. We talked for a little and when the show started we went our separate ways. After the show was over my friend and I saw him walking around outside the venue seeming lost and confused. Aparently he had dislocated his shoulder during the show and when he went outside to get some air, the venue would not let him back in. So we went over to talk to him and he was obviously in shock. We had to leave because our ride was leaving but I didn't get his last name, if anyone knows who he is (if they attended Trapfest) I would greatly appreciate some closure on if he is ok or not. He is about 6'2, short blonde hair, wore glasses, and had a little backpack on. He said he is a longboarder and this isn't the first time he has dislocated his shoulder. But please, if anyone knows who he is, I would love to know he is ok. 

TL;DR- Met a cool guy at Trapfest, Colorado. He dislocated his shoulder. Just would like to know he is okay."	t5_2qm8v	True

I've been Wiki-ing and Youtube-ing around, and so far I've learned that I'm not a huge fan of hardstyle or dnb - I can't shuffle worth a damn, and I like my music a little more chilled out than that. All I know is that I can listen to Pretty Lights for hours and not get sick of it. So, what are some good recommendations for similar sounds? 

EDIT: I realize this is WAY late for an edit, but thanks SO SO much for all the awesome recommendations guys! I was actually really excited about the song ""The Future is Now"" by Griz because I'd heard it randomly like a month ago and never knew the name of it or who it was done by. So YAY thank you for that!!

1349669769.0	114ert	What are some great EDM documentaries available online? I'll start.	jdmCrush	16	2	8	"I love learning about all kinds of different genres, artists, labels, events in every way I can. I've read many different books from [The Record Players: DJ Revolutionaries](http://www.djhistory.com/books/therecordplayers) to the semi-related [How Music Works: The Science and Psychology of Beautiful Sounds, from Beethoven to the Beatles and Beyond](http://www.amazon.com/How-Music-Works-Psychology-Beautiful/dp/0316098302).

I think YouTube has some great content as well, and really shows you a visual, primary evidential aspect to the behind-the-scenes of how things and people came to be.

1345390003.0	yh3ez	Going to be DJ'ing at my friends birthday party, but Im afraid my music might be out of date. 	donkeyb0ng	14	0	18	"First of all, I am no professional DJ by any means.  I have a nice setup (Pioneer DDJ-S1) and a couple of speakers.  I pretty much mess around every so often on them in my free time.  I can do basic mixing and looping.  However, my music selection might not be the best fit for a party/dancing atmosphere as some of my music is probably more esoteric to the average joe.  Basically I need some music that people can recognize and dance to on the floor.  I have my standards, but I think it's important for the people dancing to have a good time and dance to songs they recognize, even if it means blasting a couple of justin bieber remixes.  

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  And if you could recommend any good music pools or sites to download from, that would also be amazing.  I love hearing unique mashups and I feel it gives a lot of flare for a set.  Also, any general DJ knowledge you cna share would be very helpful."	t5_2qm8v	True

1334730301.0	sfn3o	FEED ME's take on music and art:  Motivation	A4K	12	1	1	"This is what artists should be about.  FEED ME:

&gt;'This is the greatest game in the world.'

&gt;I've almost stopped doing interviews because I'm achieving nothing. If you want to find something out about me, ask me personally. If it catches my eye, I'll respond, but dragging through another interview that no one thought about for more than two minutes seems like treading very boring water. Not that they've all been that way; but it's the trend.

&gt;A well known electronic music magazine recently wanted to do a few page spread about my production techniques. They sent me a list of preliminary questions; what plugins do I use for 'dirty' sounds, what makes a good 'drop', how much 'filth is too much filth'? Who wrote this? I could play the system; give away minimal information in exchange for some printed coverage, but at this point, fuck it. The Mau5hax thing was great; I got to interface with talented people and enjoy making music. I learnt as well as got involved. I didn't sit and have my mechanical techniques picked at while my actual motivation was ignored; we made decisions together.

&gt;I don't mind the occasional production Q, but what happened to mystery in music and art? There's YouTube tutorials for days now online. Look it up; these production conversations are redundant. The truth and effect comes in the sincerity and composition of the actual piece. If I read an interview with an artist of any type, what I want to know is the 'why' - not the 'how'. Why as electronic artists are we constricted to being quizzed monotonously about our techniques, and not ever our motivation? The reason anything I made sounds the way it did is because I sat and worked out every single piece of it myself. Give every one of us the same tools, and see what we all end up with - it's our differences in expression and decision making that makes us.

&gt;I'm doing this because I honestly don't know what else I can do. Music and art for me is a necessary release, and once people picked up on what I was making I was thrown into it. I was a bottled up, angry teenager, and I was completely consumed by the satisfaction I'd found in this new idea of making my own music. It consumed my life and I found I loved what it brought to it, and now I'm on an endless journey to see where it takes me, and where I can take it. Because of it, my entire late teenage and adult life I've been travelling the world, from Spor to Feed Me, constantly humbled by the people I've met, things I've seen, extremes I've lived through - I'm nothing but overwhelmingly grateful, it's almost too much.

&gt;Some of it has been physically and mentally tough, but so far I've never quit. It's never left my mind that should I drop dead, there's a million people who would kill to take my place. I don't believe in luck necessarily; I carved this out myself, but I am honoured to have what I have. If you're going to complain about your reality when you're living another persons dream, then I think you need a massive reality check. No one's forcing you. Music is magic; and I think as artists we have a duty to keep it that way, not dissolve it down into presets, complaints, one-upmanship and catering to the market. It's not all pink candy-floss cloud rides, and I think it looks fake if you depict it that way, but it really could be a lot fucking worse.

&gt;I used to lie and listen to my favourite records and daydream about how they were thought up, get lost in the sounds. There was no one to ask or study, and the resulting domino effect of speculation led me to my own ideas. It's always been the unknown that's motivated me. Spor was what I fell in to, but Feed Me is my world, a projection of a piece of me, and a way of expressing whatever I feel like. I couldn't have built what I have without you guys supporting me, but I'll always be creating and writing it none the less. I love you all for letting me take it this far.

&gt;I don't normally post my opinions on here, but I've never got anywhere by playing the game, and sometimes I just feel I need to 1) say thanks, and 2) say why. TLDR.
