As the title states I used to hack Neopets accounts, among other games. 

I've made over ~35billion neopoints in 2 years (on my own accounts), broken into multiple high level accounts and have sold, for real money, basically everything Neopets has ever offered.

I quit about 2 years or so ago. And I'm here mainly to answer questions you have about securing your neopets account and the most common ways hackers get access to your account. But I'll answer any questions you have.

I hope this helps some of you.

I'm currently sitting waiting for LoL World All-Stars stream to start (and will be watching it for the next ~6hrs) so I'll be able to answer your questions fairly quickly.

Cheers. :)

EDIT: Alrighty, I'm gonna hit the sack. Thank you all so much for being such wonderful hosts and not hating my guts. If I missed any questions or there are more I will happily answer them when I wake up tomorrow.. er.... today. I hope this has helped some of you out.

Its item description at the time: ""Leave this out on the 24th, and you never know what it may contain in the morning!"" 

Back in 2002, my younger self (after reading the description of the empty pillow case) bought up a BUNCH of these and started talking about it on the Help and Trades/Auction boards, asking people what they thought the prize would be for having this in your inventory. I also made several trades with Empty Pillow Cases, with my wishlist saying: ""can't wait to find out what I'll get on the 25th."" 

Soon, word spread that empty pillow cases could give you an item on Christmas day and tons of people starting buying these up, driving up the price of the empty pillow case to what I recall was more than 10k (a lot at the time). I didn't sell any of mine because I thought I would get something, and felt that the prize would be much better than 10k. Other people hoarded theirs also, sharing my sentiments. 

For the rest of the month, people continued to hoard Empty Pillow Cases, and the boards were filled with speculation. On Christmas Day, nothing appeared in anyone's inventory. People on the boards were furious.. I imagine that on that Christmas day, angry messages were sent to the staff complaining that they received nothing.

 A few days later, the item description of the empty pillow case was edited: ""Leave this out on the 24th, and you never know what it may contain in the morning!(most probably just a small bit of fluff).""

No one remembered that I was the one who started this little theory. People were dumping their empty pillow cases into the money tree or trying to sell them for 1 np in the shops. 

I remember the horror I felt; I was responsible for this debacle. I also remember being rather proud that I was responsible for an item's description being changed. I still have 54 empty pillow cases in my safety deposit box as a somber reminder of what I did. 

**TL;DR Ten years ago I started a rumor that cost people a ton of NP and forced TNT to edit an item's description.**

I've seen 4-5 people post about how their account has been compromised in the last few hours. All of them seemed to be right after getting the free NC from altador cup &amp; browsing the NC store. But changing your passwords can't hurt!

Neopets is *not* your abusive girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband/cat. Stop trying to make excuses for them. 
In fact, you should **let Neopets know that you are in charge, that you deserve better.**

**GO OUT THERE AND DEMAND PDE'S, PAINT BRUSHES AND MORPHING POTIONS! THIS IS WHAT WE ALL NEED, WANT AND DESERVE!**

TAKE A STAND, REDDITOPIANS!

There have been too many complaints about how girly the ""vanilla"" neopets scheme is, and I can't say I can blame you. :P

It has been unofficially voted that a specific COLOR was the theme, but I'm not a great designer, I can't take one color and just make it work. Instead, I took a character, and did ...this. [](/harpdarp)

So, I whipped this up. It's neo-themed, and easier on the eyes. :]

I'll be making small adjustments for the next bit.

Sorry for anyone who doesn't like it. [](/sad) Adjustments will be made, but I sadly can't please everyone. *inb4 jokes*

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1dljv0/lets_start_a_neopets_payitforward_thread/) is the first thread to anyone who may have missed it.

* If you have any extra items to offer up, list a few things on a post here OR you could set up some trades if you're comfortable with your UN being on here. :) Be sure to link to the trades and mark them reserved! Whoever bids can post what they bid so the owner will know who's a redditor.

* If you have a collection you could always use contributions to - big or small - post it! Rainbow dung? post it! Plushies? post it! Random gallery collection? post it!

* If you have a more specific wish, post it either on here and set up some junk trades and link to them - post reserved on them! If you aren't comfortable with your names being on here, please trade them via message! 

**Some things to remember:**

* It's not always recommended to post your username on here, as who knows who could see them. If you post it, or a link to your trades, please feel free to delete or edit the post afterwards! Some are comfortable with their username being posted, some are not. Please use private messaging on reddit to exchange if you are not! :)

* It is recommended that everyone send a couple of neomails back and forth if you're going to gift something big. (even something small!) Random mass gifting or trading can sometimes send TNT a red flag, and even though we are doing nothing wrong, we don't want to send the wrong idea! 

* If someone pays you a kindness, big or small, try to PAY-IT-FORWARD! Even if all you can afford is something small, or you can't do it quite yet, keep the kindness someone has paid you in mind and show someone else the same kindness in the future. :)

* **UPVOTE THIS FOR VISIBILITY!** I get no karma, it's a self post! This went really well last time, let's do it again! :)

* If anyone would like to add me, feel free to message me for my username. I love contributing to galleries and have a few neofriends I automatically send my extra plushies, apple items, etc to.


**EDIT**: Aw guys this is going really well. :) Keep searching through the posts to see if someone needs what you have, or has what you need! I plan on doing this every few weeks or so, so if you are the type of person who anticipates this stuff (like me) save up your RE items, keyquest items, etc. for the next one! Also... add each other! If someone has a plushie gallery and you come across a plushie you don't want, you can gift it to them. It doesn't have to be contained in this thread. :)

It seems to all have started in this [Neopian Times editorial](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=442), in which the editor demonstrates what the results of the Caption Competition would be like if the winners were actually chosen at random. One of the submissions they pulled up for [this image](http://images.neopets.com/caption/caption_1107.gif) was this inspired thing:

&gt;""Ahh Mr.sneky i see you are wering your fance top"" ""You are wereing yor's too mr.coconut"" ""Speaking of coconut,were did you get the new flying hat of coconut?"" ""Wat coconut?"" ""Ohh that coconut near my had WAT a coconut on my had!"" ""BOOM!"" ""AHHH MY HEAD"" ""GOOD NIGHT mr.coconut"" (12:30pm) 
&gt;

The last line in particular became a [running gag](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=478) in the editorials. The joke culminated in the the release of a Mr. Coconut [shopkeeper](http://images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2248.gif), this [mask](http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=46116), and this glorious item, the [Fance Top](http://items.jellyneo.net/?go=item&amp;showitem=46464)—the description, of course, is ""*Ahh Mr.sneky i see you are wering your fance top*"".

For example, while saying that I make 0 - 1 mil NP a day from playing Food Club may be technically true, on average I make no where near 500k a day, and it all depends completely on the age of your account. On the other hand, that statement doesn’t reveal the fact that Food Club isn’t much of a gamble at all - you’re pretty much guaranteed a profit over the long run, and that it’s even easier than Habitarium (which is heralded by everyone to be a 0-effort game).

I thought I’d put together a mini-guide that introduces the most common ways of making NP, the effort required for these methods, and the expected profits based on the time you spend on them. I’m not going to explain how to actually play these games - there are tons of resources already available for that, such as this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/yn19y/onestop_reddit_neo_portal/). Also, I’m aware a lot of this is subjective or based on empirical evidence from myself, so if you see something that looks off or have something to add, please share and I'll update the OP!

**Habitarium**

* Profit: 7-8k per hour. No active playing required. Just leave your browser on.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Requires about 5-10 minutes of maintenance every 6-8 hours to collect gems, rest, build nests, etc. You can optimize your profits even more if you have time to check every hour to collect eggs.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Medium learning curve - may take an hour or so to understand how the game works and how to get an optimal set up. Then it’ll take about 2-3 weeks to get your habitarium to level 50. You’ll still make close to 500k during that period leveling up to 50.

**Battledome**

* Profit: ~40k per day via mostly codestones and faeries as prizes. Varies greatly - if you have a pet that can defeat a difficulty 63 challenger (Koi Warrior) and can fight in the Dome of the Deep, your average profits should consistently be a bit higher. If you have premium, then fighting in the Cosmic Dome will give you nerkmids and your profits will be even higher. If you have a completely untrained pet and can only defeat Chia Clown, your average profits may be a bit lower. You can also get lucky fighting in Pango Palladium (ex. Ghost Lupe) and win PBs worth millions.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Overall it shouldn’t take anyone more than 15 minutes a day to reach the daily limit of 15 items, and if your pet is well trained and well equipped it’ll take under 5 minutes.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Battling itself is straightforward and takes 5 minutes to learn the basics. In terms of your pet, a completely untrained pet can still purchase a solid set of equipment for under 10k and be able to defeat the easiest opponents. Training your pet especially during times of war can get expensive so unless you want to train your pet for other reasons, it’s not recommended to train your pet just for better BD prizes/profit.

**KeyQuest**

* Profit: ~20k-100k per day via mostly codestones and neggs as prizes. You play 2 player games where the winner gets a gold key that’ll give you about ~10k in prizes, and the loser gets a silver key that’ll give you about ~2k in prizes on average. Paintbrushes and map pieces worth tens or hundreds of thousands are also awarded occasionally. There is a limit of redeeming 10 keys a day - so if you want you can only redeem gold keys towards that limit, and not redeem your silver keys.
* Difficulty/Effort: Hard, unless you don’t care about winning gold keys. A 2 player game will take 5-10 minutes on average, and each game will require some strategy and playing action mini-games against other real people. Most people play 10 games a day, which will take you about an hour to an hour and a half a day for about ~60k in prizes depending on how good you are.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: It only takes 5 minutes to learn the basics, everything in the game will have further instructions as you go. However, it’ll take many games to improve and learn everything, so it’ll take awhile before you start winning more and more gold keys versus silver keys. Also, you do need a decent machine and connection to succeed in the mini-games. Having a laggy computer or connection will put you at a major disadvantage in winning KQ games.

**Stock Market**

* Profit: ~15k-50k+ a day, depending on how patient you are. There is a limit of 1000 stocks you can buy a day, so you buy any stock at 15 NP (lowest price you can buy at), and sell when they get higher. If you decide to sell at 30 NP for 15k profit you might be waiting a few weeks, if you decide to sell at 60 NP for 45k profit you might be waiting a few months, etc.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Takes under a minute each day to find and buy a stock at 15 NP, and to check if you have any stocks you want to sell.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: There is no strategy at all to the stock market, since everything is pretty much completely random. I just explained the best stock market strategy in the 2 sentences earlier. However, it will take some initial investment in terms of NP, since you’ll be putting in 15k a day and won’t make any returns probably for a few weeks. 

**Food Club**

* Profit: ~30 times the age of your account in days, per day (in other words an average daily win of 2:1). For example if you have a 1 year old account, that’s about 10k a day. 10 year old account? 100k a day. Some days you’ll lose money but in the long run you’ll definitely be making a profit.
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. Takes under 5 minutes a day to set up your bets if you follow someone else’s guide (and these are widely available).
* Requirements/Learning Curve: None, other than an account that’s not too new - the older the better. There are guides available that tell you exactly how to bet each day so you don’t even have to learn anything to play each day.

**Restocking**

* Profit: Varies. There is no limit to how much you can make by restocking, and it all depends on your skill and experience. A newbie restocker might only make a few thousand NP an hour, an experienced restocker might make hundreds of thousands.
* Difficulty/Effort: Hard. Restocking takes patience and a lot of constant refreshes, although it doesn’t necessarily require 100% continuous attention. You can restock while watching TV for example, personally I restock while playing KQ.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: As mentioned earlier, this does have a pretty steep learning curve that never really ends. It shouldn’t take too long to practice getting the hang of buying an item quickly, but it does take awhile to learn what items are profitable to restock and what items are not. A fast internet connection also helps a lot. 

**Dailies**

* Profit: A few thousand a day on average, but very rarely you can get something worth millions. Also I’d like to note that some of the paid dailies are not risky at all and will net you a profit over the long run - for example, I tracked 50 Wheel of Mediocrity spins (and you can spin every hour) and netted an average of 400 NP per spin. Wheel of Excitement is similar. 
* Difficulty/Effort: Easy. It should only take you a few minutes a day to run through all your dailies, depending on which ones you do. Some “dailies” can actually be done more than once a day - for example the Wheel of Slime and the Qasalan Expellibox can be played every 8 hours. You can also buy a healing potion from the Healing Springs (such as Super Strength Healing Potion) every 40 minutes and make a quick 1k profit since they have inflated due to war. These are just examples, there are many more out there - if someone wants to help me compile a list of such multi-dailies including profitable paid multi-dailies, let me know!
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Varies, but usually none or very little. For example, forgotten shore requires assembly of the 9 map pieces which will cost around 500 NP.

**Games**

* Profit: Varies. Each different game is 3k max a day, but obviously some are harder than others to achieve that limit.
* Difficulty/Effort: Medium-Hard. Some games like Kass Basher can get you the 3k limit in under a minute, but the majority require a bit more effort. Look for guides out there on the best games in terms of effort/reward ratio, or play around to find your own favorites.
* Requirements/Learning Curve: Varies."	t5_2r64t	True

1372523272.0	1hbdwd	TNT's explanation of their stance on LGBT stuff, and some pointing toward a future sitewide rules revamp!	yattoyatto	63	7	17	"Revisiting [a topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1gkcse/lgbtq_neopets_users/) from a couple of weeks ago, [this](http://www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=601) is a pretty interesting editorial response from today's Neopian Times: 

&gt;You are correct that these words are not filtered because of any bias or discrimination! It makes us sad that anyone would think that, though we can understand how the rules could be interpreted in that way, so please allow us to explain a bit more. 
&gt;
&gt;In addition to the dating rules already mentioned, which are pretty self explanatory, we also have a list of what we call ""hot topics"" (not to be confused with the retail chain). These are discussion topics that become very heated very quickly. Politics and religion are on the list as well as certain past real world events, to give you some examples. Unfortunately, we still also have to put sexual orientation and gender identity on this list. Some people are capable of having these discussions in a mature fashion, but there are always people who resort to serious harassment and threats -- two things we definitely do not tolerate and actively attempt to prevent before they start -- and so items on the ""hot topics"" list are not allowed. 
&gt;
&gt;We've had many discussions on this over the years and we revisit the ""hot topics"" often in the hopes that we can remove some of the terms from the list. While that's not possible for the majority of these words right now, we truly hope it will be one day soon. **We're also currently in the process of a rules revamp (cue freak-out), during which we've decided to make some changes to a few of the dating rules that should help with everyday conversation regardless of orientation.** (Please forgive us but we're being a bit vague here on purpose! We don't want to confuse anyone by mentioning specific rule changes before they actually go into effect. **The entire rules revamp -- the purpose of which is to make the rules more clear and concise, explain the reasoning and spirit of the rules to everyone, and ease up on some outdated rules -- is a ways off.** We've been working on it for a while and still have a ways to go. We'll give more info when we're ready!) 
&gt;
&gt;Lastly, please know that our error messaging is standard for everything blocked by the filters. So while those words are indeed blocked for being ""inappropriate"" for Neopets, we do not mean to say that being LGBT is inappropriate in any way. Our rule revamp discussions have included various ways of making sure the messaging is appropriate to the filtered word. Our filtering systems are quite large and very complex but we'd like to try and make that happen in the future. 
&gt;
&gt;Whew. That was a long answer but we hope it explains our perspective and reasoning and makes it clear that we think you're all awesome! "	t5_2r64t	True

So.. someone got into my account, stole 2 million neopoints, bought a paint brush with it and attempted to gift it to themselves, but failed. And now I have their username.

I also just changed my password and would like to thank everyone who  wanted to help me get my money back.

1361659176.0	193o24	My perspective on the site we all know and love since I recently quit.	MagicFrappe	71	19	57	"I'm not sure if these kind of posts are acceptable here, I just recently stumbled across this subreddit, but I felt like sharing my experience with TNT and my perspective on the website we've all come to love.

A bit of background information: I joined Neopets when I was five or six, way back in 2001. I recently quit last August, which up until then the time I spent on Neopets was continuous, I never once took a hiatus. 

During those eleven years I never accomplished much. In the beginning, I struggled to make Neopoints (as I'm guessing any other young child would back then!) and I didn't have a single painted pet. 

It was pretty much like this up until the conversion came along. (Which I have to say is, in my opinion, one of the best things that happened to Neopets!) And during my last few years I managed to have a large variety of painted pets on my main and all of my sides that were fully customized and I was quite happy with. 

One thing I managed to do up until 2011 or so, was stay out of trouble. I never received any warnings, suspensions, or freezes of any kind, and I frequented the boards quite often. However, a lot of issues started to occur when TNT introduced the silencing system. 

I'm going to be honest here, I absolutely hate silences! The ability to be able to visit your account yet being **completely** shut off from the outside Neopian world is just a terrible feeling. What's worse is that TNT seemed to hand them out like candy!

Just in my last year and a half of playing I received a total of 12 silences throughout all of my accounts.

There first four I have to say were justifiable, a made a few risky posts on the PC and got into a few arguments, that probably did deserve the two-three day infractions. From that point on I was wary of getting in trouble, so I kept my nose out of troll boards and posts. Yet one day I made I post on a board telling a knock-knock joke. The joke was hardly inappropriate and in fact, it was this:

""Knock knock. 
Who's there? 
Honey bee. 
Honey bee who? 
Honey bee a dear and get me a soda!""

I received a six day silence for that post. At first I though it was maybe a mistake on the moderators part, so I submitted a ticket worded as politely as possible asking them the exact reason why I received my silence and if six days was really necessary. Four days later my ticket was answered with an extremely snarky response, stating that the reason why I was frozen was, ""none of my business, and is completely justified under the Terms and Conditions"".

I was **furious** by this statement. (Now that I think about it, I really should have taken a screenshot of it just to show how rude and unproffesional it was.) Once my silencing was up, I was more careful than I ever was when it came to posting on the boards. Sometimes I would voice my frustrations with TNT, which is probably where I went wrong. 

I literally received two-three day silences for posts such as, ""Based on my personal experience, TNT seems to be a little trigger-happy when it comes to handing out Silences."" and other things criticizing TNT. I became extremely paranoid that TNT was targeting me. Eventually they permanently silenced one of my sides (thank God it wasn't frozen.) for making a post saying it would be fun if we had an election on Neopets between great Neopian characters, similar to a presidential election. (The reason was for discussing politics.)

I decided to quit after this, I made a post on the PC putting all of my pets UFA, saying the deadline was one week and that I preferred just simple applications. TNT froze my main for holding a giveaway.

I'm not saying that TNT was targeting me, but in all honestly with some of the things I was punished for it sure felt like it. My experience with TNT does not ruin my opinion of Neopets though!

Neopets was, and always will be a big part of my childhood and my teen years. The pets on the site were some of the best (Kacheeks and Shoyrus ftw!)and I personally think that it's a great site with plenty of things to do, and even though a lot of the content being released around the time I was frozen was mainly NC based, I'm happy to hear that there's a new war-based plot out. 

I'm not quite sure why I made this post, maybe for closure I guess, but I just felt like throwing it out there.

**tl;dr I played Neopets for 11.5 years, had a great experience, but after receiving a few seemingly unjustifiable infractions and getting my main frozen- I eventually quit being fed up with TNT.**

I've taken the liberty of adding the Neopets emoticons into /r/neopets. Wasn't too difficult, already had the images all aligned properly for the flair. [](/happy)

Uh, well, here ya go. [](/lol) It's pretty much the same as the site...but without asterisks. I'll update this as more are added. [](/happy)

Rage faces AND neo-emoticons. This...this will get messy. [](/megustaperfect)

I'm usually really good at the minigames - I use my wacom tablet for a lot of them, so some games i'm nigh unbeatable. This person even beat me at petpet snare, which I had never ever been beaten at before. 

After the game I was thoroughly impressed. I sent them a neomail congratulating them, telling them I'd not had the chance to play against someone so good. 

A few minutes later I'd received a notification that they'd given me a tyrinian paint brush. 

I'm still kind of stunned. I've never been given a gift like that, ever, much less from a random KQ opponent. It really made my day. 

Does anyone else have any similar stories of neopians being generally awesome people? "	t5_2r64t	True

Since then, I and my other co-founders have introduced an item database, an avatar log, a battledome simulator, a pet color simulator, a system to collect event data on Neopets and track trends, and a system to alert you when events take place on Neopets (snowager awake, tarla drop, etc).

While we do offer a lot of legitimate player resources, we also have auto buyers, auto players, and various other auto-thingamabobbers. I know this is a legitimate community of Neopets players and I don't mean any offense by posting about a website that creates auto-thingamabobbers.

On Neopets: 2 of my last 3 KQ keys have had a map piece- one a 60k treasure map, then the 120k lab map piece according to JN. I don't know what it's at right now on neopets, but I'll look in a minute. This is great, especially since I was just gone for 6 days and couldn't do Food Club. 170k isn't much to most people, especially here, but I just spent all of my money on Nerks and didn't get much, so I now have a bit.

IRL: I got a paid internship that starts next week. I have another job at a small, web based development firm, and we are in the process of haggling over a 10-15k contract. It's a lot for us cause we are a small operation, and still trying to get our names out there. I am moving into a new place for the summer before school starts in the fall, and I'm really excited about the fact that I'll be able to pay for it. I just got back from an AMAZING experience at Bonnaroo (a music festival in TN) with my best friend, her boyfriend and my boyfriend. And my boyfriend and I were kind of rocky since school ended, because he graduated and has a real job he hates, plus band practice twice a week, and he lives about an hour away. So it was nice to not fight and just be together and listen to music. I ALSO have an audition/perhaps a photo shoot tomorrow for a commercial print thing tomorrow. They are trying to get it done pretty soon, so they are strapped for people. If they like me/I fit the part (it's for a thing for bags under eyes, so even if I don't get it, that means they think I'm too well rested) I can make some cash and have another thing to add to my resume.

This is all coming after a few really bad weeks and months. I have undiagnosed depression (i've had it diagnosed before, but that was a few years ago, but I know what it feels like) that fluctuates a lot. It's been a rough year for me, and even though these are just some small things, it seems that things are looking up for at least a little. Again, sorry if this isn't okay to post on here, but I have very few friends IRL to talk to.

tl;dr: i'm happy, and really hope everyone else is too."	t5_2r64t	True

&gt;Set the “Mad About Orange"" avatar as your active avatar and then mix Blumaroo Steak, Gourmet Cooking For Your Pet, and Orange Juice in the Mystery Island cooking pot.

&gt;Only available in August


Just a reminder for anyone without the chef bonju avatar to purchase the items needed now if you haven't already. [Blumaroo Steak] (http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=3534) and [Orange Juice](http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=3020) usually stay in the 1-5k range come August, but [Gourmet Cooking For Your Pet] (http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=1388) usually doubles. It was around 6k last week, it's ~8.8k this week. 

Edit - If you don't have the Mad About Orange avatar: Go to your inventory while carrying eight different items that have the word ""orange"" in their names. Refreshing may be required. (I had to refresh A LOT).

I am obviously not with TNT and therefore could never actually implement any designs into the game, but I think this could be fun just for kicks and giggles. :)

If anyone's interested in participating, then I would say that part of the requirements would be:

1. No editing an actual species.  Slapping horns on an Xweetok does not a new species make.

2.  It's not necessary to draw with the Neopets ""style,"" although that would be cool!

3.  Try to come up with a species name for your pet, too! :)

Let me know if you guys are interested in this idea!

As some of you may have already been informed, there is a person CGing and hacking through their guild called ""restocking and feeding kads"" (I believe) DO NOT go to the guild. Their HTML is advanced in such a way that you are in a sense giving the person access to everything you own and have.

Do not accept guild invites; better yet, just block them. Update your birthday so when trying to sign in from a different location you have that to use as a barrier even if they know your magic word. 
Do not accept any expensive items! If it seems too good to be true, it IS.
Report the wrongdoings as much as possible.


A few years back, I know that CGing through lookups and shops was really popular but TNT seems to have addressed that, and now it's going on in guilds.

As some of you may have noticed, we had a thread about removing rage-faces a day or two ago. That post was removed by the mods when it went from constructive criticism and opinions to pure harassment towards other users by the OP. Calling someone a ""fat teenager"" or ""dumb/stupid"" while stating they are incapable of ""debating logically"" is not going to end well, and people will most likely not listen anymore and will not take your arguments seriously. 


~~The boards have enough drama.~~

 ~~We've been on subredditdrama like 5 times now.~~




**On to the main point.**

Are there ANY changes that you would like to see on our subreddit that you feel would improve the general experience? This can be anything at all, big or small. (impeach /u/diceroll123)

Just let us know, and feel free to discuss!


**ETA: Keep in mind folks, these aren't necessarily things to be changed by the mod team! This is for ANY idea you may have that you might want to start seeing around here, by our community. Either you or someone else may start doing them. Whether it may be wanting to see more OC, you want to make a general trading thread or a game/avatar/trophy thread, something like the Pay It Forward threads, etc.**

1351179654.0	122ilj	Wheel of Mediocrity	LegitPedestrian	46	3	15	"[This wheel.](http://www.neopets.com/prehistoric/mediocrity.phtml) This wheel is awesome. You should spin it as often as you can (every 40 minutes). You don't want to lose NP? It costs just 100 NP to spin. What if you lose money? You won't. Not in the long run. You want stats to back that up? I have some for you.

In 100 spins, I got the top prize of 4,000 NP 3 times. That's impressive for any wheel. What if that was luck? It may have been, but I have more stats for you. In my 100 spins, do you know how much I made? Take a guess...I made nearly 40,000 NPs if I sold all the items I won. Let that sink in for a minute. 40,000 NPs from spinning a wheel 100 times. That's not luck. That's consistent. That's an average of 400 NPs a spin. This wheel would still be worth spinning if I made *half* of that.

So Reddit, go out there and spin the Wheel of Mediocrity. You have no excuse not to if you are on Neopets. Big money^Big money

Edit: Landing on the Tar Pit will make you lose an item, so don't have anything important in your inventory when you spin."	t5_2r64t	True

1366843980.0	1d1jyn	Friendly reminder for everyone, keep a notepad file with account information, in case you need to prove ownership of your account.	Happypartyfuntime	47	3	18	"Hey everyone. :)

I send this reminder out to guild members sometimes, and thought maybe it would be useful for some of you guys as well.

It's pretty useful to keep a notepad file of your account information, in case you ever get CG'ed, hacked, email compromised, etc, and need to prove that your account is actually yours. Most people never take the time to write anything down about their account, and then can't remember when they actually need to know it.

I keep the following for my main, and all my side accounts:

Date I made the list, 

Account name, 

Pet names, then for each pet their current color, HSD/stats, petpets they have, equipped battledome items, wearables they currently have on.

Bank account type, and current amount in the bank.

A sample of items from my SDB. I might list 10-20, and try to pick the weirder items I have. (if I collect items, or have a lot of a certain item, or if I have special items, like the Canada only burger king promo items.)

A sample of items in my closet. I collect a lot of NC, so my very expensive NC items are listed here. Isca wig/dress, NY in FL, Blooming garden, etc. 

If you keep a gallery, make a small list of the items there as well.

I also keep track of the last date I purchased NC, and a small list of my neofriends. If you like, feel free to write anything else down that other people wouldn't know about your account unless it was theirs...certain trades you made in the TP, NC trades, the amount of posts you have in your guild, etc.

For Firefox users, there is a extension called FireShot that allows you to take a screenshot of an entire webpage (instead of what just appears on your monitor) (thanks fuzio) :)

Maybe this will get downvoted, but it will really only take you 15 minutes to make this list, and it might come in handy one day. Update it every month or two. I haven't needed my list yet, but a few of my guild friends have needed theirs. :P"	t5_2r64t	True

Downvote people you disagree with, including all their past comments, downvote people putting pets UFA, downvote people mentioning the war, or downvote that person who's asking for advice. Pretty much what it seems to dumb down to is, people complaining that it's all boring, we've all seen it before. Eventually a new subreddit will eventually pop up called /r/TRUENEOPETS and that'll run its shit cycle, and that'll be gross. Let's also not mention some of the comments.

A great way to keep people posting is to upvote things that are awesome to the front page, and maybe commenting on why it is so awesome, so people know how to make awesome things. Downvoting everything not spectacular and not commenting makes it a bit of a hit and miss for posters in figuring out, hey, maybe people don't like when I post this. And if people dislike people having pet/item giveaways and such in /r/neopets, that's a great idea for another subreddit if it has enough interest, or another subreddit for advice, if people really dislike having all that stuff here.

**And remember, the only reason we're here is because we're all playing a game meant for kids under the age of 13.** I can't even take myself seriously at this point. I mean, the description for this subreddit is ""A subreddit made by Neopians, for Neopians, to hang out without scorn!"" Just... just keep that in mind, okay?
