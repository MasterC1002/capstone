1354310659.0	142kye	Guys, let's be serious for a minute. I think we should have a discussion about one of the most serious risks associated with our hobby.	fancyPantsOne	328	52	137	"I don't mean to bring everybody down, but I feel that this topic doesn't get nearly enough attention in the pipe smoking community. We all love to go on at length about our favorite pipes and tobaccos, best smoke spots, etc. But we hardly ever stop to talk about the major risk that we bring into our lives when we pick up the pipe. If you let this risk go unchecked, it can turn your life upside down.

Yes, I am talking about the very real risk of becoming a hipster. I've seen it first hand. A young gentleman picks up the pipe with the best of intentions, but before long, he's wearing skinny jeans and glasses, growing an ironic mustache, and posing for black-and-white photos with his pipe in hand.

PLEASE don't let this happen to you. Call your doctor and schedule a hipster screening today, before its too late."	t5_2rbzz	True

1371234218.0	1gcq70	"""Pipe smokers are rare to come by.."""	FelixTheGreat47	155	10	35	"A little story just because of how awesome this man is.

So I was smoking one of my cheaper pipes today while cutting the grass. I live in a neighborhood right next to the exit, so I always wave at the multitude of cars that pass by. One in particular was a large red Dodge truck. It passed by twice before stopping. 

The man driving leaned over through the window and asked me what I was smoking. Being a teenager, and after plenty of people asking if I was smoking weed, I responded by saying I was smoking tobacco. The man laughed and said ""Well of course! I figured that. What kind of tobacco exactly?"" I told him that I was smoking a blend from a local store called Montego Bay. 

He smiled and told me the actual name of the blend, and continued saying he worked at another local pipe tobacco store for about thirty years. He continued his story and introduced himself. We talked out front for about five minutes before the man said he had to leave.

I thanked him for the talk, and he asked me if I lived at the house I was cutting grass at. I nodded and he told me that he might stop by sometime to let my try some different blends that the local stores don't have.

Before he left, he mentioned that pipe smokers now a days are rare to come by, and he was glad that I decided to pick it up. To that man, and anyone else who stops like he did, thank you. It made my day awesome and honestly its great to hear of other local smokers."	t5_2rbzz	True

1365959255.0	1cbzxz	A story of a good guy landlord.	ubiquitous_one	131	11	17	"So I rent an apartment and have been living in it for about 9 years or so. Smoking was not prohibited under the original landlord (which was a key selling point for me) but about 4 years ago, he sold the complex and a new owner took over. He mailed out a set of rules and there was no mention of smoking so I assumed I was still in the clear. Well last week he had to get the building inspected by the fire marshal who determined that everything was good with the exception of the hard-wired smoke detector. Apparently, we needed a new one. 

So a couple days ago he came by with his repairman to install it and happened to notice my little 3-pipe rack on the coffee table. It's been there every time he has been over here but I guess this is the first time he's noticed. Now I work nights so I was asleep when he was over so my roommate was handling everything. The landlord mentioned the pipe-rack and explained that it was a non-smoking building. My roommate explained that I like to enjoy a nice pipe after work or in the morning with some coffee (ultimate yum) but he would let me know about the rules etc.

He left a letter when he was finished for each unit detailing that it was a ""non-smoking"" building and would not even permit it on the balconies as fires have been caused some places by smokers extinguishing butts into plant pots and stuff. All smoking must be done outside and away from the building. I was already prepared to essentially forego my enjoyment of a nice after-work or morning-pipe-with-coffee (with much sadness) as I just could not picture myself scuttling outside to huddle and puff in the driveway.

For me, smoking a pipe is a leisure activity so I cannot picture myself huffing a smoke down in the driveway for a nic fix so I was mentally prepared to forego my indulgence except for the rare occasion. My roommate filled me in about all this after I woke up and I called my landlord to make sure everything went okay with the installation and he brought up my pipe-rack that he had (finally) noticed. I replied that my roommate had mentioned the convo and apologized explaining how I was unaware it would be an issue as I had not seen it mentioned in the initial set of rules he mailed out and then he proceeded to blow me away lol. He decided hat I should be ""grandfathered"" in under the previous owner's rules and told me to smoke to my heart's content heh. He complimented me on my pipes and stated that I had some very nice looking briars and mentioned that he recently had an uncle pass from lung cancer due to cigarettes. I apologized for his loss and assured him I did not inhale. I thanked him and offered to  re-paint my apartment when/if I moved out which he declined as unnecessary.  I told him I would abide by his rules if he wanted but he insisted I not worry about it. What a good guy landlord ya know. How could I not post his praise?

After the car crash, his son's mother (his ex-wife) went to his apartment and took all the pipes even though he had asked specifically for them. Included were a Dunhill, a Cavvicci, and several other high end pipes. She held a yard sale and sold them all for $20 over the protests of the family. Her sister called my friend in tears saying she tried to buy them to send home, but the ex refused. 

The man who bought them was smoking a pipe, so I doubt these were bought by an eBay reseller. The sister tried to talk to him but was physically held back by the mom.

I have two kiddos, a boy and girl.  When mommy gives them a bath at night they play with all kinds of toys.  A couple of the toys are pipe bubble makers, you know the kind you blow bubbles out of.  so keep that in mind.

recently my parents came over to babysit so that my wife and I could go on a date. We went to a nice restaurant and went bowling afterwards. (real classy) We were trying to stay out past my kids' bedtimes so that when we got home we wouldn't interrupt their going to bed.

well we killed all the time we could and still ended up coming home too early.  so what do?  we decided to hang out in the back yard for a bit and just enjoy each other's company.  I pulled out my Pipe and tobacco, packed up and started smoking it.  My wife used to indulge in a cigarette once in a while when she was a teenager, nothing addictive.  So I figured maybe she'd like to try my pipe.  I handed it to her.

She proceeded to blow through it.

I almost died from laughter.  (remember the kids bubble pipe) my wife is adorable.

The first smoke of the day is important for setting your mood. If a pipe draws hard or leaves bitter juices in the bowl, if a cigarette is harsh and sears your windpipe, it can get you started wrong. To some this might see egotistical absorption in my own minutiae, which it would be if those minutiae did not affect so many other people. After a good smoke, if I am brought a list of Enemies of the People scheduled for execution and I spot a familiar name, I might easily write, in my own hand, that the person in question is to be sent to the camps, whereas if a bad pipe has soured my mood, I'll sign the list without even looking.""*

TurnerJ5	93	14	339	"So as you all know Savinelli USA is closing and another company is picking up the distribution rights. As of now I'm still on the fence about transitioning to the new company; it'll be a little ways down the road if I do decide to do so.

The long and short of this post, though, is this: I acquired, legitimately, several dozen / hundred unsmoked Savinelli pipes. Many of them were kept as backup stock for burnouts and defective units returning from stores and customers. I have a dozen pipes of my own so I really don't need this lifetime-supply stockpile.

Instead of putting them in small lots on eBay I thought I'd offer them to my redditor friends. Most of what I have would have retailed for $75 to $200; I was planning on offering you guys the higher end stuff initially and was thinking of asking for ~$30 per pipe. This seemed fair to me, but I'd like some of you guys' feedback.

Of course I also don't want to spam this subreddit trying to liquidate all this stuff, so please confine everything to this thread or just PM me for details. If it wasn't a great deal that I felt many redditors would benefit from (considering all the pipe giveaway contests I've done asking for the 'less fortunate' connoisseurs to come forward with their woeful collections) I wouldn't have considered this, but... well... this is just a 'feeler' post, so tell me what you guys think.

**edit: It'll be quite an endeavor but I'll post a list of what exactly I have to this sub later tonight/tomorrow, so folks can pick and choose**




**edit 2: I'm going to put a list together tonight and get a PayPal set up. I'll send the list to the first 2 or 3 folks that responded and then go on in order of who commented first, updating the list of what's available all the while. Keep an eye out for PM's from me tonight.**




**edit 3: Making a spreadsheet of everyone that wants one in the order they replied. so many, criminy. I'm going to go tally up exactly what I have now. I may divide them into two groups - 'lower end' and 'higher end', around $35 ($50 or $60 for the real special ones). $I'll be PMing you guys as soon as I can.**




**edit 4: Gotta stop for the night. I've catalogued 100 pipes so far.. looks like I have probably 60-80 more. A few Autographs and Punto Oro that I'll probably let go for $50, as well. I'll finish taking inventory tomorrow and start PM'ing people.. I'm still trying to figure out the best system here. I suppose sending out ten or so PMs at once with links to an image of the list I made asking for each redditor's top 10 pipes, and making the list thusly.**

Last night for instance, I was at this Irish bar downtown. I went out to smoke my pipe, while my friend joined with what is essentially his e-cig. We're chatting. I'm puffing. He's vaping and then a guy comes up to me and tells me how much he likes the pipe. Says he smokes one himself from time to time (and yes he meant tobacco). We start talking and he introduces me to his wife and their friend Chloe. I introduce them to my gang and we all have a great time. One of the guys that I was eventually introduced to heard me singing karaoke and expressed interest in having me come sing at a jam session. It was a much better time than any of us would have had, had I stayed inside, in the booth, and not smoked. My pipe was an open window and it lead to making several new friends. 

So look not at your pipe as a burden to hold secret in fear of public disgust, but rather as an ice breaker. You'll be surprised how many friends you'll make.

Any one else, please share your stories."	t5_2rbzz	True

1326426443.0	oeym4	Pipe Smoker's Laws	ClassyCodswallop	96	15	18	"1. If the purpose of your gathering is, in part or in whole, the use and consumption of tobacco, any tobacco product or accessory on the table may be used by anyone in attendance. A smoker who uses another's tobacco need not ask permission but must offer some commentary on the blend. Pipes are excluded from general use but may be fondled and ogled at any time, again with commentary.
1. 
Anyone given a standing offer to help himself or herself to a friend's tobacco need never ask for permission. However, it is still necessary to acknowledge the taking of said tobacco. A simple ""I stole a cigar"" shall suffice.
1. 
Matches and lighters should be shared without hesitation, but a smoker should only hold the lighter while lighting for a member of the opposite sex.
1. 
It is permissable to share pipes but not encouraged. Those sharing should be family or closer.
1. 
Corncob pipes are still pipes, unless they are from China.
1. 
When showing off a new pipe, it is permissible to comment on its uniqueness, its craftsmanship, or the ridiculously low price paid for it. It is not acceptable to show off a new pipe to brag about how much you spent or how impressive a pipe you can afford. The exception occurs if said pipe purchase cause your divorce. Then anything goes.
1. 
Although it is not acceptable to brag about how much you spent on a pipe,  if you feel you must, you may only tell others the price you told your wife/significant other you paid for it.
1. 
It is only acceptable to encourage Pipe Acquisition Disorder (PAD) and Tobacco Acquisition Disorder (TAD). Such compulsive purchases may never be discouraged. The exception comes if the purchase includes a pipe or rare tobacco you plan to purchase yourself. Should you decide not to purchase the item(s) for yourself, you are obligated to make the purchase for the person you discouraged from buying.
1. 
Pipes, cigars and cigarettes may be used as pointers to enhance a discussion or monologue, or in physical expression of general pontification.  They may never be used as swords. Pretending they are lightsabers may result in expulsion from the social group or place of business.
1. 
Smokers should make a good faith effort to use tobacco away from non-smokers, but as soon as someone pretends to cough, the smoker is allowed to pretend to ignore the cougher. This is doubly true if the tobacco is unlit, in which case, the smoker may blow pretend smoke in the cougher's face.
1. 
Any pipe or cigar smoker living within 50 miles of a locally owned tobacconist specializing in his or her tobacco of choice must patronize the business at least four times per year. Within 10 miles, it shall be monthly at a minimum.
1. 
Any smoker insisting others use any high-end product, be it pipe or cigar or tobacco or accessory, should supply it. Anyone not willing to buy his friends a Dunhill needs to keep quiet about them.
1. 
When it comes to tobacco-fueled social gatherings, if it is not a lie, it's not worth telling.
1. 
You can make fun of someone who is sending you free tobacco, but you shouldn't if you want that to continue.
1. 
Among the group, the person who smokes a pipe, wears glasses and has a beard is, by default, the smartest and most reliable person in the room. If more than one person fits this description, seniority will be determined by the highest percentage of naturally bald scalp.
1. 
While amongst fellow smokers, should an ember jumps out of your bowl and onto your favorite shirt, proper etiquette is to brush it away quickly, not jump up and do the hokey pokey dance while bumping in to the tin, the pipe racks and everyone else.
1. 
You can smoke a pipe, yet not be a pipe smoker. You must to elicit the accompanying and misleading sense of wisdom to be accepted as such.
1. 
A smoker should not be overly concerned when the smoking of a stout, nicotine-heavy blend causes the room to spin. For many smokers, that is the total extent of their exercise.
1. 
If inhale the aroma of another's tobacco so deeply that some becomes lodged in the nose, discretely remove the burley cube from your nostril hair before returning to the general conversation.
1. 
While discussing a pipe you wish to buy, other smokers involved in the conversation must wait 3 minutes before purchasing said item for themselves. Showing more then one picture of the pipe removes the waiting period and absolves any smoker who cannot help himself.
1. 
Proper etiquette dictates that, when at a friends house, you should either refrain from smoking or ask permission before lighting up. However, when in your own home, proper etiquette can stay outside with the non-smokers.
1. 
To smoke dottle, or not to smoke dottle, that is your option.
1. 
Size and technique don't matter. Attitude does.
1. 
Politics and religion may only be discussed so long as you can still share tobacco.
1. 
Smoking a cigar around pipe smokers and vice versa is encouraged, but anyone who lights a cigarette when higher quality tobaccos are readily available invites the mocking of his or her peers.

Alright guys and gals, I think it's time we had this discussion. I'll get to the point and then discuss why this is coming up. Do you want me/us(mods) to police the sub's contents or do you want to vote, discuss, and decide on it yourself?

**My personal experience/background:** A few months ago, you all were kind enough to elect DrScience and myself as moderators of this awesome sub. Around that same time I saw a thread in /r/cigars about how the mods had admitted to being wrong about policing the sub and they were handing it back to the users to decide what was or wasn't worthy of being viewed. This came about because of rather ""shallow"" pic posts without any discussion. They had originally created a new sub for it and banned those posts. They came back later and said, ""you want it, vote for it; don't want it? Down vote"". It was at this time that I connected my personal view points to my view points as a mod. Man can govern himself. I only ever wanted to be here to get rid of hateful/hurtful speech. As an active user I could do man other things to change or alter the content on the sub, but I never wanted to use mod power to do so.

Now I hear that people want things removed. X group believes that Y's posts are shallow. Y group believes that W's posts are annoying. Z thinks that none of them are deep enough in discussion, and A group just wants some fucking answers on how to smoke a pipe. I cannot please all of you, so here is what I propose:

**Proposition:**  Have some tolerance for posts that you don't agree with. If you truly don't believe they shouldn't be here than down vote them. After down voting, I highly recommend explaining why you did, discussion can help alleviate future misunderstandings. If it's not something you are interested in, click ""hide"" and be done with it. This is anyone's sub, this is all of our's. As much yours as mine. I'll give you an example, someone posts a meme, I recommend it for another sub. I don't remove it. I can, and I may wish to, but it has every right to be there as any of my posts do. I am sad that we have gotten to a point where we are removing posts. I am sad that we have reached a point where we have rules about what can and can't be posted. 

This isn't about /r/pipehogs, noob advice threads, meme's, tobacco reviews/discussions, this is about being a community. Everyone here is awesome as fuck and there is no need for a turf war. As every B/SotL knows, sharing is caring, and for the most part, we have very few problems.

So tell me, what do you think? Should the mods actively mod? Do you want to be the active member who makes my job pointless besides removing spam and harmful posts? Do you have a different opinion? I want to hear what all of you think. Thanks.

Sometimes its the nicotine, but usually its not.


Its the grain of the briar. The coloring of the meerschaum. The simplicity of a corn cob.


Its the curated collection. The jars, tins, and pouches of tobacco. The racks of pipes, each one unique, each one a friend.


Its beauty found in imperfection, dulled oxidation on chewed stems, a cake too thick, a blackened rim.


Its slowing down. Sharing stories with friends. Having a quiet moment to yourself.


Its the strike of a match. The spark of the lighter. The spark of promise, sparking inspiration.


Its a fleeting moment, a flame choked out by it's own smoke. The false light. The re-light.


Its tamping charred tobacco, the stoking of the fire. It's fathering the ancient element as so many have done before.


Its restraint. Setting the pipe down when it gets too hot, picking it back up after letting it rest.


Its drawing, tasting, then exhaling. It's the smoke swirling, dancing, then disappearing on a still night.


Its repetition. Familiarity. Routine.


So why do I smoke a pipe?


Sometimes its the nicotine, but usually its not.

1364936748.0	1bjhy9	r/PipeTobacco, step into brother Hex's study...	HEXAEMERON	77	7	39	"Folks, as you may have noticed (though more than likely not), I haven't really been around these parts for a few weeks. It began with a road trip, during which I drove in a circle the size of eight states and 2,300+ miles. During this time, my internet access was next to nil and I was too busy driving and visiting friends to be around. I visited tobacconists in Ohio and Kentucky. I smoked pipes and enjoyed bourbon, beer, and gin with friends all over the South and Midwest. 

The last day of vacation - a Friday - I woke up with a sore throat. I returned to work on Saturday, and by Sunday morning my throat was on fire. I went to a walk-in clinic where the doctor spent a whopping 20 seconds with me. She shined a light in my throat and said, ""Looks like strep. I'll call in a Z-pack."" Three days later, my throat felt great and I was back to normal. 

Five days after my clinic visit, though the pain was gone, my throat looked just as bad. A week and a half later, still no pain, but my throat looked just a gruesome - there is a large white patch in the back of my mouth. I gave it two weeks and I called my doctor to get it checked out; my fear was that it was [leukoplakia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoplakia). 

For nearly two weeks, I wondered what it would be like if it was precancerous, what steps I would have to go through to correct the issue, giving up my precious pipe collection, etc. And after two weeks, I had finally figured out to whom each of my pipes would go to, who all would receive parts of my cellar, and was generally at peace with the situation (if it isn't apparent yet, I can be a bit of a worrier; thanks for passing that trait down, *Mom*). 

I've been away because I was worried, because I knew that if I had to give up pipe smoking, I would genuinely miss you all, so I simply prepared for the worst while hoping for the best. And the best worked out - the doctor says it is agitated scar tissue from my old tonsillectomy. Apparently allergies are causing it to become itchy and irritated, and has probably happened for most of my life, I just haven't noticed the patch at the back of my mouth before. I have been told that I have nothing to worry about. 

So, why this unnecessarily long anti-climactic story? Check yourself before your wreck yourself, /r/PipeTobacco. This is a reminder that our hobby is hazardous to our health but it is, for us, a calculated risk we willingly take on. Do not forget to take care of your oral health, check yourself in the mirror monthly, tell your doctor and your dentist that you are a pipe smoker, whether you smoke daily or annually. Paying attention now will allow us to enjoy ourselves in this fantastic hobby for a long time to come. 

Thank you for listening to my ramble, and I am incredibly glad that I am still a member of your ranks.

I have a large beeswax candle set on the side table next to me, and I light the pipe by lighting small matchstick-size pieces of wood I have split from my fireplace kindling in the candle flame.  

About 2 years ago we took out a large pecan tree that was growing too close to the power lines, so I have been fairly well set for firewood for a while.  The wood is cut, split, stacked, and by now very well seasoned; it's pretty easy to hand-split now for kindling.  I usually end up with a number of small matchsticks I keep aside for the pipe.

I light the candle as I am sitting down to smoke.  By the time I have filled the bowl, the candle wax is nicely melted at the base of the wick.  I dip the tip of the matchstick in the wax and hold it to the flame to light.  Most of the beeswax burns off quickly, but what little is left has no objectionable flavor; in fact, being unrefined, it is just slightly tinged with honey.  The pecan is a very clean-burning wood, especially being fully dried, with no resin aftertaste.

There's no real point to this post other than to share my experience with you all.  It seems like a bit much trouble to go to, I know; but I'd rather take the time to enjoy the smoke if I'm going to do it at all, and the ritual of it makes me happy. "	t5_2rbzz	True

This last year has easily been the hardest year of my life. I moved away from my family, found out that my fiance(now wife) has Chronic Lyme's Disease, and took a job out of college that seemed awesome but has turned out to be a lot less than I had expected. Just recently I lost my Grandfather who helped raise me, and my wife just found out some more very disappointing news health-wise when she was in the Emergency Room yesterday. 

This subreddit is definitely my mental vacation and I really have enjoyed each and every one of you guys (and girls). I love hearing all your funny stories and the knowledge that you have is really amazing. Pipes have been a fairly recent hobby for me only truly getting into it during this last year, but that little bite of Vitamin N and time alone to reflect have helped keep me sane. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is Thanks! I really enjoy frequenting this group and there are some really amazing people here! It's been an honor to get to know you all, even if it is just through reading your posts :D !"	t5_2rbzz	True

**Just a warning, this story has the words semen and cum in it.**

*I was born a poor black child‚Ä¶*

So as many of you may know I am from Boston MA. I lived outside of town for most of my life until I turned 22, when a friend with an apartment needed a roommate.  I'd known this friend (let's call her Kate) since High School and for the most part trusted her.  I met her and her boyfriend (let's call him Adam) at the apartment and things went well. We got along great for a time and everything was fine.  

So I told them I smoked a pipe, and although we could smoke in the apartment per the lease, they asked me not to unless it was snowing outside. Which I agreed to since I don‚Äôt mind smoking outdoors.   So Adam is, how should I put this, a huge cockbag.  I didn‚Äôt realize it at first but the little things started to pile up. Yeah he was a spoiled brat with no job and his parents paid for everything. He got kicked out of college for dealing drugs.  And in the apartment he would throw away other peoples food to store 50 pound of ground beef he bought, just for himself, Once walked in to him masturbating naked in the living room on the couch I brought for the apartment, sneaking into my room and going through my stuff, even after I changed my bedroom lock he called a locksmith to open it.  He would use chewing tobacco and leave open cups and bowls full of his spit on the floor, which spilt everywhere, which was of course everyone else‚Äôs fault

Now all these things were really getting on my nerves, especially running out of places to sit that weren‚Äôt covered in DNA.  Adam also smoked marijuana, which is fine with me. However, THAT was ok in the house but my pipe was not, which I found to be a bit strange and rude.  He didn‚Äôt have a glass pipe or a bong or even roll joints, he‚Äôd make  ‚Äúpipes‚Äù out of apples or tin foil or soda cans etc. All of which he would leave around the house.  So after about 3 months I realized we were all living in ‚ÄúAdams Apartment.‚Äù

So, one day, Adam is sitting on the semen sofa as I walk out with my [Savinelli Qandale]( http://pipesandcigars.com/sachpiqa62ap.html) he asks me if someone could smoke pot out of a regular pipe.  In my stupidity I said ‚ÄúI guess you could but that‚Äôs not really what it‚Äôs for.‚Äù Now, I loved this pipe. It was my first pipe that was really worth the money I paid. Up until then I owned a drug store pipe and a cob.  I kept my room locked and I kept my Qandale in its original box on a shelf in my closet.  So you can imagine my surprise to come home and Adam is sitting on the cum couch, porn up on his laptop, and he‚Äôs smoking pot out of my Qandale. A whole bowl worth. I stood shocked and asked him what the hell he was doing.  He told me that I said it was ok and that I‚Äôm an asshole because he doesn‚Äôt have a job to afford a nice pipe and I do so I should share mine with him. We started to yell and insult each other, and then when I asked how he got into my room, he admitted to calling the landlord and having him get a lock smith. I knew at that point it was time to start looking for another apartment.  So I told him to clean it out and leave it on my desk in my room and I expected it clean when I got back that night. He put up a stink about it and I literally offered to buy him a pipe for him to smoke out of to shut him up.  His exact words: ‚ÄúNo, I like yours too much. I‚Äôm spoiled now.‚Äù  I had to leave. I left for the day and spent it with my friends just stressing about my roommate and all the other little things.  I texted him to remind him to clean it out (I told him to use alcohol) and to leave it on my desk.  Get home maybe 9pm, Adam is on the couch no pipe near him, porn still up on laptop, and I think he was watching fox news.  His GF Kate was upstairs and I could hear her crying. I don‚Äôt want to pry (yet) so I go into my room.  Looking, looking, I finally spot my pipe, on the floor, next to my bed, smashed.

The stem was snapped in half, and the bowl looked like it had been crushed with a hammer. Furious I went to confront him, screaming at him about what he had done. He started crying and telling me I was ruining his life and I can‚Äôt be so mean to him. I literally had to calm down and talk to him like a baby.  I asked him to tell me what happened to my pipe.  He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe you should watch where you‚Äôre walking.‚Äù  It took every ounce of strength I had not to hit this guy. I packed up anything I could and started moving home.  Never got him to replace the pipe, never got an apology, and in the end I didn‚Äôt care as long as I was done with him.


But I was not done.   Some of you may remember I said that his GF was upstairs crying.  Well if you didn‚Äôt like him before or felt kinda *meh* about him, all I have to say is:
**He Beat Up His Girlfriend**

This is a thing I cannot abide. Nope, nope, nope.    I had heard them screaming and yelling before but I didn‚Äôt know he was hitting her.  But when I finally found out I was furious. But I also know that I can‚Äôt go attacking someone unprovoked.  So I had told my landlord I was moving out and basically said that I wouldn‚Äôt be covering the rest of my part of the lease because they had broken into my room and damaged my property and I was certainly willing to press charges if I needed to since I had a witness ( the other, other roommate Richie.)  So I told them I would be out at end of the month but really I was only ever there to pick up stuff and bring it back to my parents.  


So I go there for the last time to get just a few more things. Walk in the living room watching him smack her across the face.  I have never in my life hit someone as hard as I hit him. I pick him up and put him on the couch.  He starts kicking me off and lunging at me until a full fledge fight breaks out. I keep trying to hold him down to calm him down and stop it but he somehow keeps coming.  I‚Äôm not a violent person. I‚Äôm a big guy and I‚Äôm strong. I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô1 250lbs boxer/rugby player. I‚Äôm also a big teddy bear and can usually diffuse and situation with a joke. So to put me at this level of anger had never really happened before.   Cops get called, fights over (thankfully).  At first the cops are all over me, saying its clearly my fault due to size difference.  I told them I wanted to end it but he kept it going. I was calm and cooperative.  


Adam however was on the couch screaming his head off half crying and half yelling at the cops about how I had ‚Äúruined his life.‚Äù Cops were cool, go through the routine. Search me, nothing. Search him *BAG OF COKE!* He tries to run out of apartment and cops tackle him.  After taking my statement I leave.  Kate tells Adam she is leaving.  Richie moves out. I fall asleep on way home and total my car.  

I eventually replaced the Qandale on my own. I should have really pressed charges at least to replace that. But I would have much rather have been done with it.  

**HAPPY ENDING EDIT: So after the whole fiasco, Richie (the other other roommate) was moving out of state. He didn't want to take a lot with him, including his 42 inch TV. So just to piss of Adam, who wanted to buy it for $250, Richie sold it to me. For one dollar and a coffee. Now it's in my living room. I also got a newer better car thanks to the insurance. And I was ok.**

**Scooby Doo Ending:  I can't believe I forgot this part.  So about a year later, I'm at my new job. Guess who applies for a job. Adam.  I saw his name in the pipeline, and explained to my boss that this would not be a good idea.  He agreed but asked me if I wanted to bring him in anyway. Yeah that was the last time I saw him, in the lobby of my office. He left the second he saw me.**

Those that know me; know I speak of my Cat Prissy. She was 12 years old. Marsha called her my ""Cat Wife."" She slept on my pillow by my head for years and years. She fit into a piece of my soul, and my heart! Some times she could be a cantankerous old bitch, when she wanted part of my pizza, or what ever I was eating, that she wanted. She would not take no for an answer, and was as persistent and sneaky as a thief in the night when she wanted something and I would not let her have it.

We got her from a give away litter, at a pet store in Lancaster SC. I put my hand in the cage and she walked right up and climbed into it. When we left the store and got into the pickup truck, Prissy climbed up on my shoulder and rode there, all the way home. She chirped and talked to me, and many was the night Marsha would hear Prissy and I having a conversation; with Prissy chirping and answering back as we walked down the hallway. She was a beautiful and soft green and fuzzy brown undercoated, Manx. A bonafide and genuine Rumpy.

She passed in my arms this morning at 9am EST. I should have known. She spent the last two or three days real close to me, and slept in my arms on several occasions. I had a feeling, but I put it out of my mind, because I didn't want to face the terrible truth. She made her peace with me and gave me the last friendship she had in her body.

I will miss you my friend. Prissy took a piece of my heart today with her.

***I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of my friends that have left a response. I needed (still need) a shoulder to cry on, and you've been there for me (as I knew you would.)  Despite us feeling like solitary islands in an ocean, we are connected to each other. Those connections are strings of emotion, experiences and shared memories.

**Opening Thoughts:** None of the information in here is especially original or ground breaking. Most of it is common knowledge to pipe smokers, but I try and deliver it in a way in which newer smokers can explore and learn on their own without being overwhelmed with information. All of the guides I first discovered told me how to smoke, and never explained the why‚Äôs or rational behind it all. I hope you all enjoy this short read as well as pipe smoking in general. Thank you!

**BEGINNER BASICS**  

**I want to start smoking, what do I need?** 

You need a pipe, an ignition source, tobacco, and a tamper, as well as pipe cleaners for cleaning the pipe afterwards.
Question: What kind of pipe should I get? What matters in a pipe?
As a beginner, stick to familiar materials, briar, corn cobs, and meerschaums. Get something that fits in your budget and that you like. The shape, size of the bowl, bend in the pipe, as well as other aesthetic and practical features can be figured out later. Don‚Äôt over think your first pipe.

**What kind of tobacco should I get?** 

You should get 3 different types of tobacco. An English, a Virginia or non-aromatic, and an aromatic blend. Keep in mind that any blend from these styles will not represent the whole of the style, but it will give you variety and allow you to figure out what you like and don‚Äôt like.

**What should I use to light with?**

Any soft flame lighter or matches will work. There is a lot of information about thermodynamic about lighting a pipe and what not, but at the end of the day, pick something you like. I use a variety, depending on where I am and the conditions. Stay away from hard flames or torch lighters because they can burn through the wood.

**How do I smoke?**

You must first pack your pipe, then light it, and enjoy! Seriously though, there are lots of different packing methods, but the easiest for a beginner is to fill the bowl, tamp or push the tobacco to the half way point, fill again, tamp to the ¬æ mark, and then heap the tobacco over a bit and tamp to completely fill. Light it once, the tobacco will rise, tamp it down, light it again and you are on your way. Sometimes you will need to re-light many times, and other times you will only need to relight a couple of times for the duration of the smoke. Tamp the tobacco and embers down as you smoke, try every 5 minutes or so to begin with, and try to keep the top of the tobacco level so that it smokes evenly. The point is to keep the ignited embers close to fresh tobacco.
You will also want to keep in mind that you should not be inhaling any smoke. Simply puff the smoke by drawing it into your mouth and blowing it back out. Some people can‚Äôt understand how this is possible, just try it with a liquid.

**What do I need to do for aftercare?** 

When you have finished smoking, use the shovel side of the tamper to dump the dottle or leftover bits of tobacco, out of the bowl. Run a pipe cleaner through the stem, from mouth piece to the inside of the bowl. Then wipe the inside of the bowl down with a pipe cleaner by bending it in half. Please note that not all pipes will be able to accommodate the pipe cleaner making it through the airway in one shot. Take the stem off after the bowl has cooled and finish cleaning. Do this after every smoke. You can smoke the pipe again after about an hour or two of rest. The bowl has to dry out, and contrary to popular belief a day of rest is not necessary, it was a marketing trick to sell more pipes about 50 years ago.

**Is smoking bad for me?**

Yes, yes it is. Pipe smoking has been shown to have much fewer negative effects than almost any other kind of habitual smoking, but it still has its risks, do not take my word for it, though. I am going to depart from my comrades here and I will not link to any studies or statistics about smoking, there are decent amounts of information out there, most of it done in Europe, so research it yourself to fully understand the effects. Otherwise I could just be cherry picking studies I‚Äôve found and be feeding you bad information, but you should talk to medical physician about the health effects if you are concerned.

Note: I need the communites help with this section, anything else I should add?

**Terminology:**

Estate Pipe: A pipe form a previous owner, typically smoked. These pipes can be excellent values, but need to be cleaned inside and usually outside as well.

Ghost: a flavor left behind in an estate pipe or even one of your own pipes.

Tamper: a tool to push the embers and tobacco down inside of the bowl.

Bit: The non-wood portion of the pipe, usually black, which enters your mouth.

TAD &amp; PAD: Tobacco acquisition disorder and pipe acquisition disorder. These will become self explanatory in time, or maybe not, but they typically mean that someone has gone overboard on buying pipes or tobacco.

**All thoughts and criticisms are greatly appreciated. I tried to make this short and to the point, as well as giving enough background information for the true understanding to occur. I've noticed a pretty big influx of new smokers coming in and asking the same questions, which is understandable, but maybe this guide can be used as a reference to solve their general inquiries, and the community can spend time answering specific or odd questions. Thanks again!**

1332211421.0	r4hug	Tobacco Guide	pipeweed	56	6	24	"**Virginia** - Virginia tobacco is the most popular type of tobacco nowadays. It is commonly used for blending with other types of tobaccos, but there are also plenty of tobaccos that are just plain Virginia. These plain VA blends are usually packaged as flakes. They sometimes have a tiny bit of Perique tobacco - which is naturally spicy/peppery tasting - blended with them, in which case they're referred to as a VaPer blend. Virginia tobacco leafs naturally have a high sugar content, and depending on how they're processed (""cured"") the result usually has a mild, sweet, and hay-like taste, although there are many variations.

*Recommended Virginias*: Reiner Long Golden Flake (my personal favorite), Dunhill Flake, Samuel Gawith Full Virginia Flake, McClelland Christmas Cheer, McClelland Blackwoods Flake

**English** - English blends are made using several different types of tobacco. They usually have a Virginia base, and especially in the past century, they often have what is called a ""spice tobacco"" added to them (Oriental, Latakia, or Perique tobaccos). The most common of these is Latakia, which is the component that really gives English blends their distinctive ""smoky"" characteristic. They traditionally have no added flavorings. English blends aren't for everyone (especially the room note), but many people enjoy them because of their bolder flavors.

*Recommended English Blends*: Dunhill Nightcap, Dunhill Early Morning Pipe, Dunhill My Mixture 965, Samuel Gawith Squadron Leader, Sillem's Black (although I guess this is a latakia-based aromatic)


**Aromatic** - Aromatic blends are the ones that smell really good and are most of what tobacconists sell in the big glass jars (most of these bulk tobaccos are re-named Lane or Altadis blends). They are most commonly made with a Cavendish base, which is a process of curing tobacco (usually some combination of Virginia and Burley) rather than a type per se. They are then either ""topped"" (sprayed) or ""cased' (soaked) with syrupy natural/artificial flavorings (vanilla, rum, maple, etc.). The goal is to make them taste and smell great, but the unwanted side effect is that some aromatic blends burn rather hot and can leave a goopy residue in the bottom of your pipe. Therefore, it is important to smoke them slowly to avoid ""tongue bite,"" and to be vigilant about running a post-smoke pipe cleaner through your bowl and stem.

*Recommended Aromatics*: Lane 1-Q, Trout Stream, Dan's Blue Note, Boswell Christmas Cookie or Berry Cobbler, Cornell &amp; Diehl Autumn Evening


**Burley** - Burley is a type of tobacco that is always ""air-cured"" and it is usually the kind pictured hanging in barns. It has a lower sugar content than Virginia tobacco, so it is usually regarded as slightly less sweet. Although it is most commonly used as a blending tobacco, many people smoke it in its purest form. It is a very mellow and cool-burning tobacco (hence why it's so commonly used in blending), which has a ""nutty"" taste. If you have/had a pipe-smoking grandfather (who lived in the U.S.), he most likely smoked some sort of Burley, as many of the classic American pipe tobacco blends are predominately Burley.

*Recommended Burleys*: Prince Albert, Carter Hall, Lane Burley Light, Hearth &amp; Home Classic Burley Kake"	t5_2rbzz	True

As soon as the last random is out the door I'll upload my spreadsheet somewhere (maybe Google Docs) and start spreading it around taking requests in chronological order by who commented on my post.

So the tl;dr is - **sit tight!** I'll be reaching out to all of you over the course of the next week. ~250 responses definitely took me by surprise.

Also I'm going to have to stop accepting new requests; I'll hopefully be able to accommodate the vast majority of those that replied  (I'm limiting it to 2 pipes per person) but I'm definitely at the limit.

2.  no personal blog reviews   

3.  no non-content picture/video posts

4.  no ‚Äúhow did (blank) do?‚Äù posts

5.  new members - review sidebar before posting

6.  do not hijack a review, instead post a new review

7.  No underage smoking and no posts about trees

8. Trade request and selling threads belong in /r/pipetobaccomarket

Alright guys and gals, here are the new ""rules"". Some I'll be more lenient on and others I will be strict with. We're going to see how that goes and adjust as necessary. If you'd like other rules added or rules removed this is the thread to post your thoughts in. Don't make another thread about it.

I've been seeing a lot of blogs posts as of lately and if I see that it is getting to the point of spamming for traffic, I'll extend the blog review rule to those posts and remove them as well.

Some of the rules may not seem very applicable at this time but I want to get them in place before we get too large.

By the way, the rules are largely taken from /r/scotch and our shared mod /u/texacer has had good results with them. 

-ren

**edit:** If you'd like to be an active participant in enforcing the rules, I'd appreciate if you'd report links and then message the mods or I a brief note about it why it is being reported if it isn't immediately obvious (this pertains more to comments). Thanks!

She was very accommodating about it, and told me that because of my sleuthing she was selling them quickly, and that she'd save me the two cans I was interested in. 

In the mail today, I got a parcel from Jenn unexpectedly, and inside were my two cans! ""WTF!?"", thought I, until I pulled out a card that says ""Merry Birvaleastdding, hope you enjoy the tins! :)"" 
edit: here's the most important part! I should have included it the first time. Turns out my wife-to-be went into my email, got Jenn's email from there, and sorted out the payment and the shipping! I was majorly surprised. Blown away! Mildly miffed she accessed my email without permission, but whatever, I have nothing to hide :D

So, Merry Birvaleastdding is a combination of the Christmas, birthday, Valentine's Day, Easter, and wedding celebrations, jokingly conceived by my fiancee and I because she didn't buy me a gift for any of those events (due to us being poor because of my returning to school and not working at the moment- also the reason I couldn't buy the PA myself!).

Anyway, one tin (the one with a broken paper seal) is currently rehydrating. I look forward to smoking my Birvaleastdding pipe.

TL;DR: future-wife bought me 100-year-old tobacco for birvaleastdding."	t5_2rbzz	True

I've had a great time trying out all of these new tins!  Dunhill Irish Flake is amazing and I have also fallen in love with Cornell &amp; Diehl's Ten Russians, but the other night I opened some 1792 Flake and things went south pretty quickly.

I had read a lot about this blend and was so anxious to smoke it that I filled a bowl straight out of the tin without allowing it to dry, and that is probably what saved me a trip to the emergency room.  I had a little trouble getting a good char light going and I noticed my throat felt a little funny, but thought nothing of it.  This stuff is pretty stout after all, right?  After getting it lit I took two solid puffs, but that was all I got to enjoy.  I've had a few food allergies all of my life (most notably peanuts and cinnamon), and I knew right away what was happening.  My tongue and throat started swelling, and the old familiar itching started... first behind my knees and in my armpits and then spreading to my whole body.  Luckily I knew what was going on so I grabbed some water and my handy dandy Epipen (just in case), and let it take its course.  After about half an hour all was well, so luckily I did not get enough to do anything more than give me a good scare.

I looked up the ingredients listed in the blend and the only thing that jumps out at me is the addition of Tonquin Beans, so maybe that is what caused my reaction?  I've been smoking pipes for about a year now, and this is the first blend that I've had even the slightest problem with.  Sorry for the long rambling post but I wanted to give a heads up to any of you guys who might have food allergies.  Be sure to practice safe puffing when trying new blends!"	t5_2rbzz	True

&gt;I know during the Victorian era pretty much everyone smoked, but you hardly ever hear people complaining about the odor or smoke clinging to clothes or the staining of carpets and the like. In fact, older books often comment on the smell of tobacco smoke as being something ""rich"" and pleasing.

&gt;It's hard for me to imagine the overpoweringly acrid smell of modern cigarettes as being evocative of any of that, but my cigar smoking friend once told me that cigarettes are to tobacco what Bud Light is to beer. So I'm wondering, now that cigarettes are taxed so heavily and refined with additives, have producers just turned them into something awful smelling in order to make them more nicotine intensive?

&gt;Or were previous generations just okay with that smell because living in horse-crap covered city streets made everything smell bad back then?

I was listening to music, when a depressing song came on and I just completely lost it. I felt unwanted, unloved and depressed, which is completely different for me. 

I looked over, saw my revolver and pulled it out. Checked if bullets were in it and almost put one in. Then, I started to freak out and put it back in its case. It shocked me that I even touched a bullet to take my life.

Realizing what I had just done, I pulled a pipe off the rack and packed it with some house blend English. Sat down, lit it and I was relieved to feel all my sorrows flow past me with every puff.

This showed me the power of the pipe and what it meant to me. It saved me from my own demise.

It saved my life and I wanted to share with you what I felt as a great showing of the power of the pipe.

You all are amazing and I cannot thank you all enough for being my favorite place.

Anyway, I've been smoking for almost a month now and am finally getting the hang of it. I have a shit sense of smell which usually means I can't taste much. Combined with smoking outdoors, my smoking experience has been closer to the miserable side.

Today, I went back to my local tobacconist to buy a new pipe and to load up on tobacco. While I was there, I sampled a few different tobaccos, and wow--what a difference. I was finally able to relax, and my pipe stayed lit the whole time. It was a fantastic experience, and really rekindled my enthusiasm for pipe smoking. It probably helped that I could finally taste the tobaccos!

I've been smoking a couple years now, my packing is fine, I relight 5-10 times on average I'd say, excluding the false light.

Do not worry if you need to relight 10, 15, 20 times. It's fine, it'll get a bit better as you pack better but it's really no big deal. Your pipe should not be a source of stress, it should be a reliever of stress! 

Plus, one of the benefits of piping over cigars is that you can set it down, let it go out, and come back to it hours or days later! Sometimes this makes the taste change, if you don't like the taste you don't have to smoke it, but it's usually not for the worse.

We talked for a little bit about tobacco in general and then I asked the dreaded question: ""Do you go on Reddit?"" He surprised me with a yes! I quickly replied ""/r/PipeTobacco""? ""Yup! I posted there around Christmas!""

I met a guy! I finally met a guy! His username is /u/mangoforthewin!

Another person to add to the ever growing group of pipe tobacco people!

When in years to come, if one were to mention this day of August 21, I will not remember anything of significance.

Yet in this day, just like every other day, there is so much beauty in the present moment.

The sun will cross the sky with little attention paid, yet I enjoy this moment where I may view it gently pierce through the morning clouds.

The smoke that my pipe produces will become diluted and absorbed into the atmosphere, but for this moment I view it linger and dance about in front of me.

Every fleeting flavor may be enjoyed for one instance, an instance which at the moment is my entire reality, and the next a fond memory.

I am healthy today, I have many loved ones today, and I am happy in this moment. As sure as anything the health, happiness, love, and life will flow out of everyone I know and myself just as it fills me in this moment. 

I have observed this moment and I have let it pass so that I may observe the next, and the one that follows it.

The moment neither lends itself to be viewed, nor does it conceal itself. It passes as all things do, silently moving through the present into what we refer to as the past. "	t5_2rbzz	True

1361153168.0	18q46y	Why the hate for aromatics?	ubiquitous_one	47	4	39	"On every pipe-related forum I have ever visited or frequented, there has always been a prejudice against ""cheap"" aromatic blends. Personally, I have loved pipe tobacco blends all across the spectrum and even more so the option to select a specific blend for a specific time or setting whereas smokers of other formats do not necessarily have such options. I enjoy cozying up by my fireplace with a rich smokey Va/Per blend or socializing it up at some family gathering with a scrumptious aromatic that tantalizes the noses of those around me.

And to be honest... Growing up in a family of cigarette smokers, I never would have considered ever taking up the stink-weed I so much despised. Were it not for one fateful day in my mid-teen years when my family went out to a local baseball match. There, on the edge of the box seats, was a gentleman (who would later turn out to be my gov't history teacher in high school) puffing away on a pipe with a blend that smelled of a delicious smokey hot cocoa. Most likely, it was simply some generic ""cheap"" aromatic but it completely changed my perspective in that tobacco smoke was **not** intrinsically a thing o be hated. It did not hurt, though, that as I passed him to find my seat, a lovely young lady stopped to tell him how wonderful his pipe smelled.

That incident, piqued my interest and started my journey. Never again would I view all tobacco products as equal because for the first time, I had viewed a smoker as not someone to be ""tolerated"" but as someone whose presence was welcomed and enjoyed. So even though I enjoy my english blends a bit more than my aromatics (for pure self-indulgence) my aromatics have an added enjoyment of knowing that I am bestowing upon those around me a rch and wonderful aroma of pipey goodness that (as a smoker) I have sadly learned I do not get to enjoy myself.

And with that, I proudly set flame to my bowl of *humble* captain black and blow out a cloud of sweet aromatic smoke to obscure my view of those that would hate upon my my delicious indulgence!

HEXAEMERON	44	6	19	"*""For the past twenty three years Craig and his partner and love of his life Patty devoted themselves to their family and his great passion, pipe tobacco and pipe smokers. Craig found pipe smokers to be among the most interesting of the people he met during his rich and full life and years of traveling the world. His genuine love of people and friendly, outgoing and larger than life personality was evident to all who came in contact with him, whether by phone or in person. On many occasions visitors would come by to visit at Cornell &amp; Diehl and all had the same reaction, that they felt they already knew Craig and Patty from getting to know them on the phone and felt they were visiting with an old friend on their first face to face meeting.    
While Craig will certainly be missed by all whose lives he touched he wouldn‚Äôt want us to be saddened by his leaving. He viewed life as a wonderful adventure, meant to be savored and experienced to the fullest and shared with others. Selfishness was a foreign concept to Craig; he gave fully and freely of himself to all he came in contact with and would wish to be remembered with a smile and a heart full of good will for others. Though our world here on earth is a bit darker, we should all be heartened by the knowledge Heaven is a bit brighter, lit by Craig‚Äôs rogueish, joyful smile and his booming voice announcing his arrival with the words, 'Oh, what fun!'  
The Tarler Family asks that in lieu of flowers donations be made to favorite charities to carry on Craig‚Äôs love and concern for those less fortunate.""*

(Not exactly required when using an ashtray.) But for those of us who have a convienient, out of sight location next to our favorite smoke spot, we need to make sure there are no living embers before we dump it. 

My story. I was smoking in my favorite spot at home, my back porch. Its covered, east facing, large deck to the side, many birds in the day, and few trees for a clear star filled view at night. It was midday and the wife was getting ready to go shopping. Well she finished before my smoke was done and since the blend wasn't doing it for me that day, i decided to forgo saving the last 1/4 bowl, and I dumped it all in the usual spot, the rock pile next to the drainspout. Fast forward three days to this morning. As always when I'm outside the dog continually drops his ball in front of my feet. This time as I was heading toward the door he droped the ball and it rolled off the deck and into the rock pile by the spout. I went to pick it up to throw it and found the wood surrounding the pile to be partialy burned out. It really hit me hard. What if it had burned the house down?! I don't know what i would have done if it had. I haven't even lived here a year, my wife is allways home, and our first baby is on it's way.

Moral of the story is, don't dump your hot ash anywhere a it could start a fire.

  ""Pipe smoking is the oldest form of smoking tobacco, developed during an era in which men would make time to sit at the end of a hard day‚Äôs toil, to rock back and forth in their favorite chair and observe the rotation of life. They had an understanding that prolonged satisfaction is greater than the immediate and fleeting gratification we have a tendency to seek today.

Unfortunately as winter approaches we will have to find a warmer spot considering we use my porch as our smoke spot. I love that this night has been infamously dubbed ""porch night"".

First time poster, long time lurker. Just came in from a session with some Black Cavendish in my small black billiard. I'm a third year college student, having stumbled upon pipes this summer when I stumbled into a pipe shop in Austin(Pipe World, on Anderson) on a whim. Then and there, I fell in love. I bought the shops custom blend of Old Denmark, and waited two hours for them to get a shipment which included a couple of lower grade churchwardens that I had inquired about, and choose from. 

Since then, I have found out that I am actually a third generation pipe smoker, and maybe even further than that. My grandfather, who passed when I was young and I knew was an avid cigar smoker, also smoked a pipe in his leisure. My father, who I knew smoked cigars, also smoked a pipe during his college years. Such it is that the pipe has brought me closer to my father; both of us are socially awkward, sharing no common interests with one another; he is a salesman first and foremost, and has traveled for a better part of my life. Such was the case with his father, though he was anchored, both were just as insular.   When my family found out I smoked (which I had kept secret, because my father is a tongue cancer survivor), my father made it a point to go to a local lounge and have a smoke and a pint. We learned about each other, and he conveyed stories of my grandfather, of which I know precious few.

So here's to that curious weed! That amazing, wonderful plant, from which we draw such warm mirth. Thank you, tobacco, for letting me find my roots and connect with my family; and thank you, r/pipetobacco, for making me feel as though I am amongst a group of old friends, for such companionship and comradery is rare in modern times.

_____________________

The sliver of my house dedicated to pipes and pipe tobacco - a space squeezed between a punching bag and a wall - was overrun by tobacco acquisition disorder (let's call it by its full name - takes away the fear): Tobacco tins piled on the workbench, pipes stacked like sooty Tetris pieces, and Mason jars took up increasingly valuable space in the cabinet.

So spring cleaning began. And I'd like /r/pipetobacco to benefit. **I'm giving away four batches of pipe tobacco, each approximately 7 ounces (give or take) of 5 or 6 tobaccos.** 

Why am I giving them away? Because I still have a weenie-shrinking backlog of new tins to open, along with some cellared favorites. 

Pics of the cleaning results and the groups of tobacco: http://imgur.com/a/Kj6Vm.

***How do I get my hands on this amazing smokable jetsam, ihavetime?*** 

Excellent question, everyone reading this. I'm going to have a contest.

Here are the rules:

   * ~~If you'd like to throw your proverbial hat into the proverbial ring for the not proverbial tobacco, post a comment with the best thing that happened to you in April, and make it 10 words or less. This isn't a pitch to find the saddest happy thing - no maudlin Reddit-Forever-Alone bullshit. Just state the best thing.~~ &lt;-- Contest is over. Thanks!
   * I will write down all the names of those who commented and randomly pick four people. Or I will have my toddler son randomly pick people. Or I will ask the crackhead guy who keeps pooping in my driveway to randomly pick people. My point is that it's random.
   * ***Wait, you're not judging the entries?*** No. I just want people to reflect on a happy moment and then for four of those people to be randomly selected for free pipe tobacco. 
   * You must be in the United States. This is because I am using flat-rate USPS boxes to send the tobacco. Note: I have no idea if there are such things as flat-rate USPS boxes, but I'm just going with that assumption because it seems reasonable.
   * You must be the age of majority (or at least of smoking age) in your state and my state (spoiler: I'm in California, but you already knew that when you Reddit-stalked me by looking at my other posts).
   * Know that I'm a hobbyist and not a tobacco merchant. Each of the bags I'm sending out has the date that I opened the tin. Since then, they've been sealed their respective Mason jars. While I haven't seen anything untoward - mold, angry tobacco huldofolk, etc. - you take this at your own risk. A couple of the tobaccos came out of the tin drier than I like, but I'm sure you can address that because you are resourceful and handsome.
   * You must be a nice person.

I will edit this post with an update when entries are no longer being taken, probably Sunday, or maybe Monday, and will announce the winners after.

Have at it.

Anyways, let's get this started!

As we all know, smoking a pipe has become a strange hobby in the eyes of the public, especially compared to let's say fifty years ago. Back then, most men smoked a pipe, cigars, shag or chewed tobacco. These days, it's mostly cigarettes and to a lesser degree cigars. A nice example would be [chapter 30](http://www.mobydickthewhale.com/moby-dick/moby-dick-chapter-30.htm) of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. 

*""How now,"" he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, ""this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring-aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I'll smoke no more-""*

*He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.*

Ahab just went batshit crazy and threw his pipe in the sea. Because you know, he was crazy. Sane people don't part with their pipes.

Pipesmoking itself was ingrained in society to such a degree that throwing away a pipe stood model for going crazy. That's hardly imaginable in the time period we're living in, where pipes are removed from holiday pictures of Santa Claus and teenagers consider cigarettes much cooler than old-fashioned pipes. Except the glass pipes that may not be mentioned over here, that is.  

The decline in popularity has had great consequences on the market for pipes and pipe tobacco‚Äôs. Hundreds, if not thousands of large and small brands have disappeared or where bought by larger companies. These larger companies continued to gobble up smaller brands and ateliers, a good example of such a company being Butz-Choquin. 

Mediumsized manufacturers had difficulties competing with larger companies; what remains now are individual pipemakers and large companies.

Lots of companies are experiencing problems and have to outsource large processes to other companies: Stanwell‚Äôs aren‚Äôt made in Denkmark anymore, they‚Äôre from Italy these days.  Peterson‚Äôs are preshaped and drilled elsewhere, they‚Äôre only finished in Ireland. Most of the big guys from Saint-Claude need money from the government via shady routes to survive and stay healthy. 

Many manufacturers have problems getting the briar they need; it‚Äôs not uncommon to only get two-third to half of the amount of the blocks they order. While we‚Äôre at it, briar starts to get worse and worse in quality every year. While custom pipemakers can afford to buy better blocks, large companies can‚Äôt.

Even worse, extremely large companies like Gubbels (not very known in the US, but quality wise on par with the big guys) with a yearly output of **250.000 briar pipes** have problems (they went bankrupt but managed a restart). 

I feel that the large companies, the true dinosaurs are slowly dying. Producing good quality in high numbers becomes more and more expensive and difficult, 

 On the other hand, pipe smoking seems to be making a comeback since a few years. Young people are willing to try smoking something besides cigarettes, whether it‚Äôs due to wanting to live a ‚Äúmanly‚Äù lifestyle, reading and watching Tolkien and other fantasy novels or simply enjoying the act of smoking a pipe to relax from a day of working. 

Something is definitely going on (even this subreddit is growing every day), but I wonder what the future will bring us. Will the rise in popularity and the increased respect pipe smoking is starting to get in pop culture (Sherlock Holmes movies and series, Hans Landa‚Äôs calabash, Gandalf and the dwarves and lots of other series and movies) really help? 

What are your thoughts on this? Is it going to remain stable, grow or will the hobby fade back into obscurity in a few years? "	t5_2rbzz	True

Unfortunately, most of these shops get at least a dozen calls a day from people who are confused as to whether their local cigar store sells nitrous.  Here's my analysis of each.


**Head shops**  
Typically found near colleges (is there a college of 5k+ students in the US that does NOT have a head shop within a 15-minute walk of campus?), in alternative towns, or in lower-to-middle class neighborhoods.  Often located in the basements of buildings in my experience, with a small sign by the sidewalk and a set of stairs leading down to the shop.  420 and Bob Marley imagery can be prominent.  Often prominently feature a sign to the effect of, ""These products are for TOBACCO use only, including the water pipes. If you call them 'bongs' we will have to ask you to leave.""  K2, Spice, Nitrous, and VCR head cleaners were/are also very common.  


Worth checking out to see the glass pipes and glass art, which can be pretty interesting, but otherwise not really for people who smoke tobacco.  I would wager that something like 95+% of the ""tobacco shops"" in California fall into this category.


**Discount cigarette / tobacco shops**  
Typically found right off the highway, on major 4-lane roads or near busy intersections, in locations with high traffic.  Often located in buildings that look a little bit older and off, sometimes ones that formerly contained a convenience store or gas station, or that just don't quite seem to be good for any other purpose.  If they are in a low-tax state, expect to right them right off the highway, right near the state line.  The word ""Discount"" (or some other value-related term) is often contained in their name, so these are usually pretty easy to guess at when you drive by them.


These shops are mostly catering to the cigarette and RYO crowd.  They will have cheap cigs, papers and injectors, ""pipe tobacco"" that is really RYO tobacco, and flavored cigarillos ($15/carton for things that would be grape cigarettes were it not for the fact that they have a tobacco wrapper instead of a paper one).  Not much in these shops for pipe smokers, though some shops will have OTC blends and maybe a few cobs.  Occasionally you will see a very small humidor in these shops as well, but it's usually an obvious afterthought.  




**Legit cigar/pipe shops**  
There is usually one of these in the downtown of most mid-size or larger cities, with the possible exception of California and other weed-loving areas (I looked for one of these in San Francisco for three days, and I'll be damned if I couldn't find one at all, nothing but head shops there).  In other areas, these legit shops can sometimes be found in small strip malls or other areas in middle-to-upper class towns.  Look for ""cigars"" in the name or on the sign, that is usually a good indicator.  Many of these B&amp;Ms will have house blends that are really relabeled bulk blends, and if you ask nicely the employees will often tell you which ones they are, too (""Yeah, our X blend is really Lane 1-Q"").  Most of the shops focus on cigars, with varying degrees of pipe tobacco available, but the better ones blend their own custom blends either on site or off site to their specs (Uhle's, Iwan Ries, Boswell, etc).


With all the anti-smoking laws in effect (can't even smoke in outdoor parks in many areas!), these shops are often the only places left to smoke indoors or in public.



Understanding which of the three types of a shops a particular shop is at a distance (or via an online listing) isn't always easy, but it's not usually that tough.  ""Discount"" and ""Value"" shops tend to make it very obvious, which head shops are more or less discreet depending on the area and on local tolerance.  As much as I hate to say it, I find Yelp reviews helpful, as many of the reviewers will mention the ""awesome glass pipe"" or ""great cigar"" that they purchased at a shop.  Call the shops if you must, but be specific.  For example, ask ""Do you have Peterson briar pipes?"" instead of, ""Do you sell pipes"", or ""Do you carry Oliva Serie V cigars?"" instead of ""Do you sell tobacco?""."	t5_2rbzz	True

My first order included the now stereotypical Dunhill Nightcap and FMC, plus a few bulks from McClellands. I really enjoyed the FMC and that distinct ""ketchupy"" smell that they tend to have. 

Not being able to afford that at the moment I decided to try and buy some other bulk tobaccos from the same company. I've been finding a whole treasure of things within the Mcc bulk line. 

I encourage everyone to take a look if you aready haven't and try some out, they are cheap and taste amazing

a few of my favs are:

*Mcc No. 5110 ""Dark English"" - this right here...is so good(if you like FMC you'll love this)

*Mcc No. 2050 ""Oriental Cavendish"" This one has a very ketchupy smell and a smooth taste, I have strayed away from cavendish lately but this one always gets ordered. Delicious.

*Mcc No. 2020 ""Matured Cake"" &amp; No. 3035 ""Dark Navy Flake"" Take these two, set yourself about 1 to 1 mixture out to dry before dinner. Break these two down together for the most amazing after dinner smoke you'll ever have. Very smooth with an almost raisin and wood smell. sweet wood taste.

well that's all, anyone who has enjoyed the MccLellands bulk line as much as me feel free to share :]"	t5_2rbzz	True

1371753856.0	1gqsab	A Pressing Matter	pfeifenraucher	44	4	15	"Good day, pipers,

So who's pressin? This is my current bean can press, with a nice rigid US steel clamp. I was a bit skeptical at first that the c clamp would get enough torque to press to gloss the surface of the tobacco, but I was quite pleased with the result. Pressed tobaccos are my favorite, and out of them the Kake style is my preference. I'm going to try pressing a kake of each of my favorite loose tobaks. 

[Here are some photos](http://imgur.com/a/B8b7b). 

The picture of the pressed tobacco is a beautiful and pungent Kake I just made of HH Black House. I'm currently pressing some Squadron Leader, which I expect will be fantastic. I wanted to share how easy it is to make one of these, and how you can really use them to get increased variety and new experiences out of your favorite blends.

Pressing tobaccos is a transformational process, where flavor profiles are married, and altered, producing surprising results.

This bean can press is made from a bush's baked beans can, which has been opened with a safety can opener. It rests upon a marble counter top sample. The wooden press is a hand-carved round from a hickory branch, several inches deep, carved to approximately fit the diameter of the can, and the c clamp is vintage American steel, not that cheap chinese iron crap all the hardware stores have today, which doesn't work (I've tried two of them). Honestly, that was the most difficult piece to acquire. 

The trick is having the foresight to plan to remove the pressed tobacco when the job is done. There are various innovations to employ to this end, but I have opted to simply place a long strip of webbing along the bottom of the can, beneath the tobacco. When the press is released, applying tension to the webbing and pulling will dislodge the pressed disc. 

It is also a good idea to place a waxed paper, or waxed cardboard on the top and bottom of the tobacco, so as to prevent sticking, and facilitate removal. 

Tricks to try with the press:

* pressing your own mixed from scratch blends.

* pressing trademarked blends.

* combining blends as layers, creating unique combinations in gorgeous stratified kakes. you can really experiment here, and come up with truly original aesthetic creations. 

Style tip: place embossed or raised surface lettering, symbols or images beneath the tobacco, on the bottom of the can, so as to press the image into the finished tobacco, creating your own unique mark.

Hope you've enjoyed our little show and tell, and I hope it inspires you to get ta pressin!

Be warned, however, *pressing* tobacco is almost as addicting as *buying* tobacco, and considering how much tobacco can be pressed into a small disc, the two activities may lend to one another to significantly increased exposure for financial endangerment. 

Only good smokes to you.

Cheers. 

**edit:** forgot a point about how much tobak to press:

when using loose tobaks, gravity fill the press cavity, mildly hand tamp, and gravity fill again. finish with another mild hand tamp. the tobak should not be decidedly mashed in there, but firm and not easily yielding to more mild tamping. i have read that by doing this, the compression ratio is something like 1:8 or 1:10, so it's really quite a lot of squishing going on. just experiment, fill, press for a week or two, and enjoy!"	t5_2rbzz	True

1370631357.0	1fvoen	Pipe recommendations for various budgets. $10 $25 $50 $100	cheech_sp	44	4	16	"There seem to have been quite a few posts lately by people looking for pipe recommendations (many for around $50).  I know we can't list all the brands, but I'm looking for a general short list of pipes that anybody should at least check out.  What would you add to a budget pipe list?

There is a note about estate pipes, but this list will focus on new pipes that a new piper could easily shop for.

**Estate Pipes**

Estate pipes are pre-owned (usually used) pipes.  Buying and selling estate pipes is common, some people have success finding nice estate pipes at antique shops.  As with any used market, quality and condition can be hit or miss, and price is unpredictable; at least to the novice piper.

**$10**

* Corn Cob Pipes (Missouri Meerschaum) - these are inexpensive and not fancy, but these will generally give a better smoking experience than most sub-$50 pipes.  MM cobs might be /r/PipeTobacco's favourite recommendation to a new piper.
* Clay Pipes ([Penn Valley](http://www.pipeshoppe.com/ps_clay.php) is popular, $7-$20 +shipping)

**$25**

* Kaywoodie - well regarded, might be your best bet at a quality pipe in this category
* Dr. Grabow - found online, and at many tobacconists and drug stores (Walgreens, CVS, etc)
* generic 'basket' pipes - found at any pipe tobacconist, quality is very unpredictable

**$50**

* Savinelli - select [budget lines](http://www.cupojoes.com/cgi-bin/dept?dpt=H&amp;srch=KW&amp;search_text=Todays+Special+03) are &lt;$50
* Bjarne Viking - [P&amp;C lists quite a few for $56](http://pipesandcigars.com/bjarne.html)

**$100**

* Peterson - the Killarney series and others should be ~$100
* Savinelli
* Stanwell
* Butz-Choquin
* Erik Nording
* Johs

I would like to run a simple little contest for this fine subreddit - which I must admit I don't frequent nearly enough, for someone in my line of work. 

The guidelines are not complicated (and slanted towards newer pipesmokers - this won't be very interesting to the veterans out there with extensive collections). Simply: 

Reply to this thread with a brief summary of why **you** deserve to win a wonderful new [**Savinelli Duca Carlo**](http://www.milantobacco.com/savinelli_duca_carlo_pipes2.htm). Be creative; feel free to post a picture of the dinky corn-cob (not that there's anything wrong with that!) or whatever your current go-to smoker might be along with a short blurb on what this timeless hobby means to you as a budding pipe enthusiast, and why you feel you deserve to claim these spoils.

There is no need to debase yourself here but the better picture you paint of your woefully inadequate situation the greater chance you have at winning!

I won't randomly select a commenter but will let the upvotes decide so, please, fellow /r/pipetobacconists, be discerning and send the most deserving redditor to the top here.

Contest will be closed after midnight on Friday, let's say, and the winner will receive:

* **1 new (unsmoked) Savinelli Duca Carlo** (shape TBD - most likely a [**classic 'bent' style**](http://www.cupojoes.com/cgi-bin/spgm?dpt=H&amp;srch=KW&amp;item=savdc628))

* [**Several packs of 6mm balsa filters**](http://www.pipesandcigars.com/savbalsys6mm.html)

* **2 tins of top-quality** [**Savinelli brand pipe tobacco**](http://pipesandcigars.com/savinelli.html)

* [**1 classic 3-in-1 pipe tool**](http://www.vintagechiccigar.com/savinelli-model-classic-pipe-tool-pack-p-1174.html)

So please, have-at! And if this is inappropriate for whatever reason (I'm not sure of contest rules / precedent in this sub) please let me know.

Cheers, /r/pipetobacco!

My fellow mod everybody_else created this little haven about two years ago, I came on board to help out a year later and now we have almost 2,000 pipe enthusiasts in our ranks! Congratulations, guys!

This sub is full of great, knowledgable people who have had pipe smoking as their passion for years and years, it is also full of those who are just getting into the hobby for the first time. Always ready to chat about pipe topics and to give advice, this is a great little community of BOTL. 

It has come to my attention that it is time for some closer camaraderie to take place. Thus, we begin **the first [/r/pipetobacco](/r/pipetobacco) tobacco trade**. 

Our brothers over at [/r/cigars](/r/cigars) have been doing trades for a long time and it has gone wonderfully for the most part. I, along with other members of the community feel that it would be fun to set up a tobacco trade! So that's what we will be doing. 



-----
The trade will happen starting in March but I'll lay out the basic guidelines here..

**Step 1**

Create a trade sign up post. If you want to participate in the [/r/pipetobacco](/r/pipetobacco) trade, simply post in the thread indicating so.

**Step 2**

Random pairings will be made using a rng to pair two members

**Step 3**

Create a trade pairings post which will show the pairings

**Step 4**

From here on it is all on the partners. PM your partner and trade addresses and decide on how much tobacco to trade. 2oz minimum but anything goes. 

**Step 5**

Send off packages!

**Step 6**

Post pictures of your great trades! 




-----


As the trades come in, I will attempt to add flair to the members who completed a successful trade. Give me a while to do this but as I do, you will receive a [+] next to your name. This flair will indicate to the community who the members are who have proven to be trustworthy and completed a good trade. 

So yep, that's about it. Let me know if you have any questions, upvote this so people see it, and be on the lookout for the March sign up post which should appear a few days before march actually starts. Thanks guys! "	t5_2rbzz	True

(Or: How I Found Myself Smoking in a Ghetto in the Heart of Beijing)	Jaxx2112	38	2	8	"This has been pretty requested story and so I found it fitting to tell it now, what with the podcast challenge this week. I won‚Äôt delay any longer, so without further ado-- The Old Chinese Man and His Pipe.

.

Some of you, through IRC, Pipe N Skype, or passing, know that in 2011, I spent just shy of 9 months working in China.  I was finishing up my undergraduate degree at Northeastern University in Boston and decided I was going to spend my 3rd cooperative experience (kinda like a paid internship) abroad.  I ended up working for a contract manufacturer in southwest China about an hour outside of Shenzhen in a small town outside of the city of Dongguan in the Guangdong province.  During this time I took a vacation to Japan and felt that on the way back I should stop off and see Beijing.  It was a few months from the end of my coop, I had done traveling in southwest China earlier and didn‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôd have an issue traveling alone.  (For reference, i‚Äôm a 6‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô white male, so most people were more likely to ask for a photo than to rob me.)

.

So during my stay in Beijing, I decided that one of the places I had to check out were the Hutongs.  The Hutongs are low rent areas that are split into residential and marketplaces.   The marketplaces are infamous and quite cool, with some streets being so narrow that two people can‚Äôt even walk side by side.  While searching for the marketplace Hutongs I found myself wandering into the residential neighborhood without realizing it.  Rather soon I found myself smack dab in the middle of the Beijing residential hutong, where [holes in concrete walls were patched with pieces of wooden doors, the rooftops were waterproofed with tarp and cinder blocks, and life was rather dismal](http://imgur.com/a/hckTm).  Full families lived here while their children worked to provide food for them or go to the Beijing universities to hopefully branch out and find a better life.  

.

At this time, right about when I realized that I was probably not supposed to be in this area, I saw something familiar, something I hadn‚Äôt seen my entire time in China.  It was a pipe smoker.  He was an old man, who couldn‚Äôt have been any younger than 75, shirtless (mind you it was July) and sitting on an empty milk crate nursing an basket pipe past its prime.  It was held together with black electrical tape wrapped a quarter of an inch thick along the shank and stem, likely from a crack tenon at some point, and was clinging on its last legs.  But this didn‚Äôt stop the old man, he just sat there, puffing away.  When I saw him, my heart lept.  Without thinking I hoisted my rucksack over my shoulder and retrieved a small rectangular box.  It was my [Savinelli Piazza](http://imgur.com/a/9ntQH), a pipe I had bought 3 months prior to commemerate my life in China.  I showed it to him and tried to speak broken Mandarin, but without success.  Once I realized the err of my ways, I simply pointed at his pipe, at him and then at my pipe and myself, as if to say ‚ÄúHey buddy!  We both do this!‚Äù.  He looked at me, looked at my pipe, and smiled a crooked grin with his crooked teeth.  

.

He retrieved a haggard aluminum tin from his side, with what must have been the driest tobacco i‚Äôd ever seen. I could only guess it was some RYO virginia.  He pushed it towards me, as if to offer me some.  I was hesitant to say the least.  I decided ‚ÄúFuck it, i‚Äôll have a quarter of a bowl.‚Äù  Nope!  He saw me gingerly put in a small amount and then decided he was going to help me.  He took a heavy pinch, wadded it up and jammed it into my pipe with his thumb while i was holding it.  I reached for my lighter, but before I could take it out, he produced a broken red bic with a crack pipe flame coming out of it.  I took a few puffs and found out that my previous guess was certainly correct. It wasn‚Äôt the most pleasurable smoke, but it burned quick, a little hot, didn‚Äôt bite, and for those of you who enjoy tobacco reviews-- it even burned to a fine white ash.

.

He offered his crate to me and I declined, choosing to sit on the dust covered street.  We tried to talk, him in simple mandarin, me in exceptionally broken as fuck mandarin.  We didn‚Äôt get too far.  He tried to ask me where I came from, I told him the USA.  He asked me a few other questions I didn‚Äôt understand, but if I had to guess, he was asking me why i was here, or what brought me to China.  In the end it didn‚Äôt really matter.  We sat there, puffing in silence and simply enjoyed each others company.  As I finished up my bowl I took out a tin of Nightcap and offered it to him, but he had already refilled his bowl while I was smoking and refused.  I tried again to give him the tin, but he wouldn‚Äôt have it.  In the end, someone i assume was his son compromised and rolled one using my nightcap.  I didn‚Äôt have the heart to try and stop him--it was obvious they were trying to be polite and wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer.  Well... needless to say, he didn‚Äôt like it, he coughed a bit and pointed to my tin and said ‚Äúbu hao‚Äù--‚ÄúNot Good‚Äù. I shrugged it off and now he probably thinks that all American‚Äôs inhale English blends in RYO cigs.  After a few more minutes, I asked/gestured for a photograph and then respected his wishes when he declined.  In hindsight I wish I had gotten a picture of the pipe and especially one of us, the remarkable pair from two worlds who shared a bowl while sitting on the dirty streets of Beijing, with nothin‚Äô in common but the leaf."	t5_2rbzz	True

I‚Äôve taken up pipe smoking around two years or so. I don‚Äôt know the exact date, as I didn‚Äôt mark it on a calendar or anything. I imagine I have taken a common path, first cigarettes (yuck!), then cigars (too expensive), then pipe smoking. I have never met a pipe smoker, so my information was gathered via internet. 

It started with months of research and studying before even picking up a pipe. Lots of reading through forums and watching videos on YouTube etc.  It was surprising how something so seemingly simple led to such an immersion. I became obsessed with reading about different makers, materials, air flow properties and shapes, techniques, care and restoration of pipes, oh and tobaccos so much to learn there. It really does make sense that people refer to smoking a pipe as a hobby. 

My research and limited budget led to my purchase of a cheap estate pipe on ebay, and a small order of tobacco and pipe cleaners from PipesandCigars. After obtaining the pipe, the process of ‚Äúrestoration‚Äù begun. It simply consisted of crud removal,  and many alcohol dipped pipe cleaners. At this point there was still the matter of the stem. I could have went with the stem bleach process, micromesh wet sanding, bench polishing etc, but at this point I was simply interested in just cleaning up and smoking the damn thing. 

Which led to my first innovation. Turtle wax, yes the cheap line of automotive grade detailing products. The stem was made to shine with an application of rubbing compound, polish, and then wax; all by hand. I can just picture the reactions of some reading this. ‚ÄúOh no, you must use Tripoli!,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs automotive stuff, it could be toxic!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBwaaahhh!!‚Äù My rebuttal would consist of, its cheap, it leaves no tastes or odors, it can be applied by hand, and you can pick it all up at wal-mart; and as far as toxicity goes, I wouldn‚Äôt want to eat a jar full of either. 

After ‚Äúrestoring‚Äù my estate pipe, it was loaded with a nightcap match using the three fill method and lit. Very nice, this is great. I realized how much I would like this, and how often I would be smoking. But, a worry crept into my mind. I thought to myself, since I only have this one pipe and would like to smoke all of the time; I had better get a hold of more pipes to build up a rotation. 

Over time more pipes were acquired, more techniques were used to fix them up, such as reaming, and salt and alcohol treatments; to remove those ‚Äúghosts‚Äù that were lurking in every estate pipe. Looking back it is a shame I ever did that to some of those pipes. Sure some were funky, but some gave off such a delightful aroma upon reaming that they never should have been treated. Now of course purists would state all used pipes should be S&amp;A treated, even if the cake does smell and taste delightful; and without treatment you‚Äôll never be able to truly taste an English, or Virginia tobacco. With which, I can‚Äôt disagree. Although, it is quite possible to still enjoy these blends with casper lurking in the bowl. Afterall, some ghosts ARE friendly. 

Anyhow, as time went on I did more research and realized the initial pipe I bought was quite old and rare. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúOh no, you‚Äôll mess it up; better go grab the ugliest pipe in the bunch and practice smoking with that.‚Äù So that‚Äôs just what I did. I kept acquiring and restoring pipes for the all important rotation, whilst still smoking that dented and chewed up old estate pipe. 

Bowl after bowl went by, and in some degree I was right. There was initial rim blackening via careless use of a Bic. There may have been some over reaming, and above all there was an unfathomable amount of ‚ÄúOversmoking.‚Äù 

Day in day out, bowl after bowl; I chain smoked that little pipe for close to two years. This pipe rested only when I slept, or didn‚Äôt feel like smoking. My technique improved, and the pipe stayed lit. Overtime I slacked with cleaning and did experience a ‚Äúsour pipe.‚Äù I put this in quotations not because it doesn‚Äôt exist, but due to the fact that it doesn‚Äôt exist in the sense it is described as. It is simply a bad taste that develops due to saliva, moisture, and tobacco juices in the pipe. Yes it is gross, yes it does impart a bad taste to the pipe.  But, it is completely removed with a good alcohol cleaning. 

Which led to my current practice of running a pipe cleaner through after every bowl, and a decent cleaning with alcohol, Q-tips, and pipe cleaners after 10 bowls or whenever I feel like it.  This seems to work, and results in good tastes, and no clogs, or gurgling even with the goopiest of aromatics. This practice has led to many enjoyable smokes back to back, but wait how can this be that pipe hasn‚Äôt had a chance to dry out! It hasn‚Äôt had a proper rest. 

Ah, resting. The primary reason I have over twenty pipes. The plan was that when I became experienced enough to be trusted smoking a decent pipe, that I would graduate from that dinged, and scratched and beat to hell old estate pipe. The hope was that this old pipe would somehow by miracle withstand this smoking with no resting, and all allow me a little time to develop a proper smoking technique. 

How can a pipe be smoked bowl after bowl (sometimes not even allowed to cool,) day after day and last for any length of time. Surely, it would experience a burnout, or a permanent souring. After all the briar absorbs moisture and needs a chance to release it. Maybe the moisture in the wood would get heated upon smoking, and lead to every subsequent bowl stinging the users tongue with steam causing a horrible heat bite. 

Well, I‚Äôm here to say those things just didn‚Äôt happen. Sure I did experience some bites when I went through the phase of not cleaning the pipe enough, or sampling certain blends that didn‚Äôt agree with me. But, the lack of resting resulted in no damage to the pipe, and many, many enjoyable smokes. In fact I still smoke that pipe daily, years after picking up smoking. I now would consider my smoking technique sufficient to enjoy my other pipes, but a funny thing happened. 

I grew to love that little pipe. It is always here by my side. I have simply grown accustomed to its characteristics. Day in, day out; I don‚Äôt get bored with it or feel something missing in my smoking sessions. Sure I still read about other pipes, and their history. I think P.A.D. can be very rewarding. In fact, the principle of rotation mislead me into the purchase of my pipes, but P.A.D. is the reason I have kept them. 

One must keep in mind the nature of pipe smoking. The purpose of which is ultimately enjoyment. Which can range from the enjoyment a nicotine addict gets from their fix, or the quiet contemplation that occurs from the solace a nice smoke can provide, to the synergistic effect a pipe can provide amongst good drinks and good friends. No matter what a pipe is to be enjoyed, all can agree on that. 

My point is that pipe smoking can be enjoyed by all, regardless of degree of immersion into the hobby. One can pick up a pipe and some Prince Albert, and be thoroughly satisfied with the experience it provides for the rest of their life. It is possible to not tire of such things for some. On the other hand it is possible for ones enjoyment to increase exponentially through a life time of immersion. 

Although PAD and TAD are worthwhile. Satisfaction is granted upon experiencing an enjoyable smoke; fulfillment is obtained when one has reached a level of immersion that they are content with. Although some may never reach fulfillment, all will experience satisfaction. 

TL,DR: like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.

Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...

1329156476.0	pnqc5	On the state of pipe tobacco reviews.	geese	36	0	26	"Good afternoon. As a pretty avid pipe smoker (although admittedly new &lt; 3 years) I've found researching different tobaccos/pipes/techniques to be a pretty tedious endeavor. Since pipe smoking has gone out of style, some of us can no longer rely on personal interviews with experts and must instead take to the internet. This is where it gets difficult; the combination of differing personal taste, conflicting information, and useless reviews make pipe smoking a daunting hobby to pick up and fails to reflect the relaxing nature of the smoke.   


I would mainly like to discuss tobacco reviews as I think this is the area that has the most to gain with the advent of the internet.   
    
I used to do most of my research on a tobacco on sites like [tobaccoreviews.com](http://www.tobaccoreviews.com). The combination of an active user base and a database of many blends makes it a useful tool for research. The problem with tobacco reviews  in my opinion (as well as many other websites of a similar nature) is that most of the reviews are nearly useless. Below are some of the problems I've noticed with tobacco reviews in general:


1. **There is no indication what so ever of a persons level of experience with a particular tobacco category!**
 
      If you only ever smoke aromatics, even the most tantalizing English blend might be lost on you. You wouldn't take advice on fine scotch from someone who doesn't drink it himself so why do the same with tobacco? Conversely if a person smokes an English blend for the first time and LOVES it, they may not have any idea how it compares to other English blends and a 4 star rating may be inappropriate. 

2. **The language of the reviews is often poetic and anecdotal rather than actually useful.**

     I find that many reviews for tobacco often relate someone's personal experience (often in a borderline religious/poetic way) with the tobacco they are reviewing. Often times the review will contain very little useful information about the physical tobacco. I've been known to do a little freestyle when I get a good pipe going but this information serves no purpose in a tobacco review and would be better placed on a blog.

3. **Subjectivity makes many reviews impossible to make sense of.**

     Admittedly there is no accounting for taste but it seems to be that describing one tobacco in terms of another tobacco might be more useful than a vague concept of ""fruitiness"" or ""camp fire flavor"". Direct comparison in my opinion is far better. Take [r/pipetobacco](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/) reviewer ReverendVerse's line in a recent review: *""By adding in red and black virginias and orientals, in small amounts, it takes off the 'edge' of pure latakia, but still maintains it's strong flavor that latakia is known for.""*. This is a great example of good language to use in a review. It establishes a great basis for comparison. 

I hope the long winded post wasn't too boring, I could probably continue the rant but instead I'll post an example review of what I'm going for in the comments. Please let me know if reviews in a similar vein would be desirable. 

**tl;dr** I think tobacco reviews could use improvement (see comment below) and am thinking about starting a blog/website to see if I could fix some of the problems I perceive in how we currently review pipe tobacco and ultimately explain our hobby to newbies. Thanks for your time."	t5_2rbzz	True
