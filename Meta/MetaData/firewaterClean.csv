Though almost none of our posts have come from these domains, I feel that the attacks on violentacrez privacy are disgusting and should be discouraged.
Violentacrez was one of the only people to help me with moderation questions when I first took over this sub, did some of the coding redirects for us and answered lots of other questions I have had over the years.  
I hope this meets with the communities support, and to continue, a post from /r/MensRights as to the reasoning.

As some of you may know, a prominent member of Reddit's community, Violentacrez, deleted his account recently. This was as a result of a 'journalist' seeking out his personal information and threatening to publish it, which would have a significant impact on his life.

Adrian Chen has engaged in an active pursuit to harrass and, allegedly, blackmail reddit moderators with public release of photos and personal information, and has also been implicated in posting large-scale hoaxes and attacks against reddit as a whole.

As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened outside of reddit for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

As a result, the moderators of [2] /r/mensrights have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker/Jezebel network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity. We thank you for your understanding.

The following websites are no longer going to get traffic from [3] /r/mensrights :

1337855363.0	u2k9x	Let's brew: Rum	considerspiders	35	3	16	"**Rum**

Hi, I’m basically bouncing this off you lot before putting it on Distillapedia, comments and criticism welcomed.  None of it is 100% my own work, It’s drawn together from lots of different sources, mostly cited at the end in further reading. Split into two parts to fit into self post limits. 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••

**Recipe for the ferment:**   

Rather than just giving out a list of ingredients that someone can repeat, I’m trying to help people understand the “why” with this stuff. So if you’re just looking for a recipe, go look at pugirum or fast fermenting molasses wash in the further reading section.   



*Sugar source:*    

A roughly 1:1 ratio of feed molasses and white or raw sugar (raw is better, but more expensive for most people). Increase the molasses for a heavier rum, decrease for a lighter rum. You want a rapid ferment for rum, and bacteria are your friends for this, so keep the potential ABV low. It's best to calculate this on the fermentable sugar content of your molasses rather than using a hydrometer, the unfermentables will throw the hydro reading off (for the same reason, expect it to finish dry at 1.02ish). Don't go above 8% ABV (calculated off finishing @ 1.02) or you'll kill the bacteria. If you don't care about that then still, keep it low for a clean ferment, 10% is ok, 12% getting pretty high.  
 Normally feed molasses has around about 50% fermentable sugars, and weighs about 1.4kg per litre, so there is 0.7kg fermentables per litre in most feed molasses. Your molasses must be preservative free (normally a sulphide if it's there). I haven't run into any with preservatives in NZ though. Feed molasses normally runs about $2 per kilo, unless you can find a friendly farmer buying in bulk. 


*Liquid:* 

Well aerated water and dunder (spent wash from the still) from the previous batch (a note about aging dunder at the end). Oxygen is essential for yeast multiplication, which is why you should aerate. Roughly 30% of the liquid should be dunder. Increasing this will result in a more full bodied and heavy rum, decreasing this will make a lighter rum. Increasing this will also lower the pH. Keep an eye on this, it's easy to let it get too low over several generations. The ideal pH for the yeast and bacterial combination that we want in a rum is about 5.5-5.6 – you can use calcium carbonate or citric acid to correct, and vary your dunder addition. You can also *carefully* use baking soda, but if you do this with lots or often the sodium will start to slow the yeast down.  

If it's the first batch, just use water, and maybe some citric acid or acid blend to correct pH if needed. Heat the water to dissolve the molasses, but try not to boil the molasses, we want the bacteria living in it to survive if possible.   

The dunder is a critical component for flavour and complexity. It keeps getting better as you go through generations.  

**Additional nutrients:**  

Molasses is normally short on magnesium and nitrogen, so I normally beef up the ferment with a couple of tablespoons of Diammonium phosphate (DaP) and a pinch or two of epsom salts. A lot of people boil up some yeast or add b vitamins, the previous ferment is a good source of this. I sometimes do this (don't use all of it, you'll probably want to pitch onto about half of it). You can search around the various forums for “Yeast bomb” recipes if you want specific instructions on this. If I recall there are instructions in “Pugirum” and “Pint’s Fast Fermenting Molasses Wash” (links at the bottom). I suggest experimenting to see what works for you – your molasses and water profile is likely different to mine.  

**Yeast:**   

If possible, a rum yeast is of course best. Ask any brewer – different yeasts for different jobs. This attitude is yet to really catch on in homedistilling circles, for some reason, with a lot of people just using bakers yeast for everything.    

I have some EDV493, which is great – my first choice. Now called DistilaMax RM I believe. Throws a lot of esters etc which is all flavour, but quite intense, so maybe not a great choice if you’re planning on pot stilling and drinking white – it’s better for aged pot stilled stuff or lightly refluxed white. Danstill A is ok. A lot of people use the EC1118 (champagne) strain, and a lot of people do ok with bakers yeast, which in my opinion is only really good as a starting point. I’ve used Belgian beer yeasts with ok results. I would advise you to avoid turbo yeasts. Pitch plenty of whatever you go with. 

 

**Sanitation:**   

This is not as critical as it is in other brewing activities. We don’t need the stuff to “keep” any longer than it takes to get it to the still so don’t worry about anything other than a rinse out. 

**Ferment:**  

Ferment hot, at say 27-30C, depending on your yeast of course – try to keep it near the top of the ferment range. Try to keep the temp as steady as possible. If you’re using EDV493 it’ll want to run away on you because that yeast is a monster. 

**Speed:**  

Expect a fast ferment. Leave plenty of headroom in the fermenter.

**Clarification:**            
I like to rack and clear my rum - some people like the taste of the boiled yeast in the distillate, I'm not a fan, so I used to rack off the lees a few days after fermentation is finished, chuck in a litre or 3 of water to keep the yeast happy til the next ferment, and leave for another few days in another vessel to settle a bit more. I don't use finings, I'm afraid of what they'll do to the next ferment when I reuse dunder or lees.   

Nowdays I ferment in my brewing fridges with temperature control, so I can cold crash or 1°C after fermentation – lower the temperature so the yeast falls out of suspension. Works a treat, and I can rack straight into the boiler.

I didn't start the petition, but I'm trying to help get signatures because it's a cause I deeply believe in. I understand that some people have reservations about signing a petition due to activities they participate in. If you are nervous about signing then do the next best thing: get someone you know who doesn't participate in questionable activities to sign it. Someone who has nothing to hide. I signed it and I got 10 other people to. If everyone would do this we could get 10,000 signatures no problem. Just imagine being able to go to a function where people who build stills and sell distilling equipment could meet with home distillers and try spirits and compare designs and recipes. Where you could have contests and enter your spirits for tastings and see how they hold up to everyone else's. Wouldn't that be totally awesome?!? This needs to be the next step. Please consider signing this petition and please consider asking anyone else you know that might be willing to sign it as well. Thank you in advance for your help!

Posting White House petitions seems like a iffy issue, considering the downvotes the x-posters have gotten in other threads. It's annoying but whatever. That said, glad to see the petition did well here. 

So the thing with the White House petitions is that there is a 150 signature threshold that you need to bypass in order to get the petition public and to have any real chance of exceeding the 25000 signature goal. If we want to give this petition a chance of getting a reply (no matter which way the reply goes), we should try to get more to sign within reddit and ideally out. Uhh, so here's my plea .., if you happen to have a facebook act, or other social networking act. please share on there. Craiglist is another possibility unless they have rules against posting petitions. If not, I would say we should work together in posting in as many sub cities as possible, in the right sections of course.

1367867549.0	1dt5fx	single run, double run, or reflux	potstillin	19	2	12	I've always been a double run guy, strip washes, then combine to do a slow spirit run. Lately I've been doing a slower 6 gallon single run of UJSSM. Pitching the 1st quart of fores and heads, collecting down to 40% abv, then running the rest off into a feints jug down to 20%abv. I always did the double cause I thought is was a waste of good alcohol from 40% to 20%. But now I'm looking forward to doing an all tails feints run of the 5 gallon mix I'm collecting. I tried the heads and tails feints run when I first started and wasn't impressed with the result from my potstill. Seemed like I just recollected the headsy crap and seperated it out again. The hearts and tails weren't too bad but I was new and wanted to make many other things instead of rerunning so I got into the habit of pitching what I didn't want immediately. I think I might have been a tad hasty in getting rid of everything but hearts and early tails. This next feints run will tell the tale for me. I've thought about refluxing, but I'm just not willing to babaysit the still for that long at a stretch. I would rather run a couple 6 gallon batches in 3 hours a couple times a week instead of a huge batch for hours on end.

This is what 25 pounds of bananas looks like from the store, the ripeness is about how I like to eat them, but they are too green and starchy at this stage for optimal flavor and fermenting. More time to ripen is needed, when they're disgusting, then they're good to go. 

Every endeavour needs a plan of action. My plan is to buzzed from bananas. First we need a recipe, let's try this:
25 pounds of very ripe bananas, should be fragrant, soft, and brown
12 pounds sugar
1 tbs yeast nutrient
1 tbs citric acid or equivalent
pinch of Epsom salt
EC1118 Lavin yeast packet

While heating four gallons of water, sugar, Epsom salt, and citric acid to boiling, cut ends off bananas and chunk up in inch sized pieces. Place pieces in large tub or fermentor (I use a 16 gallon tub), pour hot water over bananas and blend with drill powered paddle. Add balance (2 gallons) of water to help cool wash to about 95 degrees, then pitch yeast and blend in. After cap forms, punch down daily for the next couple days and keep covered in warm area about 75 degrees to ferment. 
From there we'll just have to see what happens and how fast the ferment goes.

Considering our large lurker portion of the community (3000+ readers and about 20 regular contributors and 60+ regular commenters [this is a guess really]) it is hard for me to come up with a better way to do this.  Seeing as how this is the first year I knew we were to be given this opprotunity I will spend a more thoughtful approach to next year.  So here we are:

Best commenter/contributor - /u/considerspiders

There is no debate here, honestly.  Constant and consistant wonderful posts and comments.

Best infusion with followup - /u/gbakanowski

Good [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/firewater/comments/13ifpw/xpost_from_rvodka_our_first_attempt_at_infusion/) with excellent [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rpr6hNuE7o&amp;feature=colike), it me smile and had one of higher upvotes for a post

Picture [Post](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=382183641876201) - /u/BishopMartin

Although I thought the music was awful, its great to encourage those distilling who wish to pursue it as a business the best.  And there was a dog.

Sorry for the loss - /u/CarbonGod

Now this may seem cheap electing to have two individuals who are also moderators win.  CarbonGod was a good contributor and I think s/he will do great as a mod.  It was almost immediately after I elected him to mod that the announcement for free gold to be given away occured and I can't rationalize taking his ability to win away.

Frequent enough contribution and first to raise their hand -/u/erkthejerk73

Mainly because /u/Dagon reinforced the vote.

I've got a 15 gallon keg, 4 ft of 2"" copper from a scrap yard, various small copper fittings and other parts. I've read ""The Compleat Distiller"", and done a bunch of other research. I'm comfortable with fermentation. I've made a few batches of beer and wine.

I like whiskey, I want to make whiskey, but from what I've read it's hard to do well. This is an expensive hobby, plus illegal in the States (where I live). I'm been thinking of just giving up and spending money on good whiskey instead since I'd never be able to make anything that good.

While money's not tight for me at all, I don't like spending it on things I'm only going to use a few times. I began to tell myself, I'll probably only fire up this thing one, taste my mediocre product, and then sell the still for scrap. I tried some moonshine made by one of my dad's students (he's a college prof), and it was terrible, tasted like mildew. I figured that's what my product would taste like.

This is where the story turns around. I really wanted to distill something, but I don't have a working still. I knew the concept of a wok still, so I decided just for fun I'd try it out this weekend. I put one together and filled it with 2L of Victory's [Golden Monkey](http://victorybeer.com/beers/golden-monkey/) beer. I fired it up, and less than an hour later, my collection container was full of a clear white liquid. I poured it into a jar, and let it cool. I tasted it and was very happy with the outcome. 

This experience has given me new motivation to continue in this endeavor. The one thing I wish I had was a local mentor. I do know of a guy who is a friend of a friend that makes grappa in his basement, maybe I'll try to get introduced to him.

TL;DR: I was discouraged by the cost and difficulty of home distilling, but got renewed interest after making some nice product on a hastily built wok still."	t5_2rcpo	True

I'm new to home distillation. So new, in fact, I've never distilled. I'm an avid homebrewer and winemaker and spirit enjoy-er. As a homebrewer, I many large pots, propane burners, and fermentation vessels, and experience. 

Rather than try out distillation with a makeshift still, I received a nice Christmas bonus from work and will be taking about $400 and building a still. I've followed the designs, with a few modifications, on [this site.](http://moonshine-still.com/) 

First of all, the guide was written in 2001 and copper prices have quadrupled. Nonetheless, I'm determined to convert an eight gallon brewpot into a still.

I've ordered ""All"" (I expect I will need more) the parts I will need and will update this post with my progress and first few batches as time progresses. As of writing this, I've spent roughly $340 on parts and tools (I'm 22 and therefore only have the essentials thus-far).

The first step is the tools necessary to finish the job (Bolded I purchased at home depot):

* Drills and Bits
* Center punch
* **Mapp Gas Torch, flux, and solder**
* steel wool
* bench vice
* **Round file**

Fittings (Purchassed at Home Depot, Copper unless otherwise specified):

* 2""x 2""x 1.5"" Reducing Tee
* 2: 1.5""x 1.5""x 0.5"" Reducing Tee
* 1.5""x 1"" Reducing Elbow
* 1""x 1/2"" Reducer
* 2: 1.5"" Caps
* 2"" Cap
* 2"" Threaded copper adapter
* 2"" Stainless Steel Flange  

Copper Pipe (Purchased by the foot at PlumbingSupply.com):

* 2"" x 36"" (Column)
* 1.5"" x 24"" (Condenser shell and cross pipe)
* 1"" x 24"" (Condenser Core)
* 1/2"" x 24"" (Condenser Input / Output flow)

Plans for assembly:
I'm going to follow the reflux-still plans on the website linked above. I've begun to plan my first round of distillations.

Vodka / Moonshine:
I plan on doing a basic cane sugar boil followed by the addition of nutrients and PH stabilizers. I'm going to use campaign yeast and produce roughly 15 gallons of total wash at roughly 10%. I will distill this to the maximum potential of my still (95%), filter, and cut it with distilled water to multiple concentrations. These will be infused or left plain at half-gallon increments (I should have 5-7 final containers depending on the concentrations). I'm considering the moonshine / vodka batch to be my practice for making whiskey.

Whiskey:
I plan on taking 48lbs Marris Otter, 2# peat malt, mashing at 148 F, for a total of 20 gallons wash at roughly 7-8% fermented by Irish Ale yeast. From there, I will distill it to 75% and cut it to 62.5%. I'm too cheap to opt for the wooden barrels (and I like to see my product), so a 2.5 gallon glass fermentor with french oak chips will have to do (has done well for me in the past with wine and beer).
 
I will update with pictures and progress as I have pictures and progress.

**EDIT 1:**

Based on the Bokakob love in the comments, the design will be more similar to this [MSPaint picture](http://imgur.com/egW7X) (Based on the equipment I have already bought, and what I can still return)

I will have a secondary condenser which will use the output from the coil to cool the liquid.

This design should cut about $20 off the material cost. It eliminates the need for the following:

* 2""x 2""x 1.5"" Reducing Tee - $20
* 2: 1.5""x 1.5""x 0.5"" Reducing Tee - $28
* 1.5""x 1"" Reducing Elbow - $10
* 1""x 1/2"" Reducer - $7
* 2"" Cap - $7
* 1.5 x 12"" copper tube - $13 (The other 12 inches will be used for my condenser)

It should add the need for the following:

* The 2"" pipe should be 12"" longer (I'm compensating by using my half my 1.5"" tube), and I will need to purchase a 2"" x 1.5"" reducer - $7
* 1/4 Coil - $10
* 2: 1"" Caps - $8 (Secondary Condenser)
* 1/2"" Elbow - $2 (Secondary Condenser)
* 3"" x 3"" copper plate - Collection Plate, will be cut - $5
* 1/2"" - Copper Valve and fittings -$10

**EDIT 2:**
The Mash will begin tonight for the single malt whiskey using the very simple recipe:

* 95% Base Marris Otter Malt
* 5% Peat Smoked Malt
* Mashed at 148F (Dry Finish) for 90 Minutes, Sparge at 170F
* Boil for 60-90 minutes to break down protein chains
* Crash cooled with immersion chiller
* Low Ester Ale Yeast fermented slightly below recommended temperatures (65F) 
* High Oxygenation of wort to facilitate yeast reproduction and decrease ester production
* Primary fermentation for 4-7 days followed by racking to a secondary vessel for clarification for 3-4 days (I won't need longer to ""improve"" flavor so long as fermentation is complete). In actuality, it will sit in the secondary until my still is complete. 
* At this point, the wash is ready for distillation.

The wash for my vodka / moonshine will be a bit simpler. I'll take hot water and add sugar until its starting gravity is roughly 1.075. This will be heated to sterilize. I will cool the mixture. I will add nutrient and PH stabilizers. It will be fermented with champagne yeast until its final gravity is below 1.00 (roughly 10% abv). Sugar leads to high fusel alcohol production, but is significantly cheaper than grain. I will use this wash to try and understand the basics of stripping. 

For tonight, I plan on starting roughly 35 gallons of fermenting wash. 

**Edit 3:**

I've got the supplies, but got into [an accident on my way home from the brewstore](http://imgur.com/TZGJh,iW9N0#0) tonight and took a ride in [a police car](http://i.imgur.com/iW9N0.jpg).

[This is an album of the supplies I bought.](http://imgur.com/a/CJNLs)

**Edit 4**

So, I learned I'm not supposed to boil the wort for whiskey, and so I did not. I brewed my first batch of wash with half the grain I purchassed (57# total, I used roughly half).

[Here is the album of the brewing.](http://imgur.com/a/vk8sW)

Part of what I like about this community thus-far is I can spell out my plans, and someone tells me why I'm wrong before I take permanent missteps (Boka still, boiling).

All the parts I ordered online for the still should be arriving this week, so the plan is to build the still this weekend. This will let me go for my first run by the following weekend. More to come, and I will make a new post with my still assembly once the parts all come in.

Apart from the incredibly smooth, clean taste of my spirits, I've also noticed that it's much harder to recognise the effects of the alcohol. While commercial spirits will tend to make me a little tired and groggy after a few drinks, I can drink a LOT of moonshine before I feel the same way. While it will eventually become evident through poorer coordination and mild slurring, I don't feel the same degree of lethargy in my body nor in my head.

For the most part I'm sure it's a positive thing, though it does make it easier to drink excessively and not realise. Is this a common experience or is it just me?

It tastes like pine trees! Really really bad pine treas. The astringency is extremely high, and its undrinkable above 50% and only tolerable at 40%. When you're striving for excellence, coming up with a bad Gin when you're shooting for a good whiskey is never a good thing. Also, it gunked up the inside of my still and I spent 30 minutes cleaning the packing.

I'll keep everyone posted on whether or not the beer turns out good. I went for and Pale Ale because I figured the hoppyness would distract from the lack of specialty malts. 
Recipe for 5 gallon mash:

* 9# Marris otter
* .5# Peat Smoked Malt
* Mash
* Ferment
* Distill 
* 2 oz Centennial hops (Beginning of the distillation, I would do )
* 2 oz cascade Hops (1 oz @ 5 min, post-distillation, 1 oz Flame-out)

However the wine is treated with sulfite and I understand that can be a problem.  
1) Can the sulfite be removed via the copper in the still itself?  
2) Does the entire still including boiler need to be copper or can just the still head itself?
3) If a copper still won't solve the problem what about carbon filtration?  Or treating the wine with ascorbic acid to oxidize all the sulfur?

1356018030.0	1565wo	Let's talk about freeze distillation	4merpunk	16	5	50	"It's kinda that time of year to talk about freeze distillation (I live in a northern state that hasn't seen a proper winter in about a decade so that's where the 'kinda' comes in).  

Freeze distillation is a simple process of where you take your wash or wort and place it in a suitable container (either in two liters for your home freeze or leave it in a bucket and place it outside during a heavy cold) and remove chunks of ice to increase your abv.  It's a very passive type of distillation that almost any homebrewer or distiller can do and requires no purchasing of equipment, nor expenditure of resources (wood, electric, propane).

Freeze distillation is the primary way to create such beauties as applejack (which is taking a hard cider, and freezing the water off it).  I have done applejacking before and it was delicious, but I am sure it can be done with other brews (Germany and Belgium I think, are going back and forth in creating the strongest beer in the world and I hypothesize they use freeze distillation to create that, but I am not sure).

We've had only a few posts in the past about freeze distillation and different mods that people use ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/firewater/comments/kc1kt/use_a_salad_spinner_for_efficient/) was a fun one about a salad spinner) so take heart and tell us about what you do or might plan to do this year."	t5_2rcpo	True
1352966632.0	138c4z	What do you like to add to your shine once its said and done?	ghostknyght	17	2	9	"Personally these are a few of my recipes that I've used in the past.

*Kahlua

1.75l of vodka (neutral flavored spirit is the idea)
1l of coffee (full standard pot of coffee, 64 oz, you get the idea)
     When making the coffee you want it to be super strong. Much, much stronger that what you would normally drink. If using a standard sized filter, fill it up to the top. 
32 oz of sugar

Honestly its super super simple make your coffee, add the sugar, mix in the alcohol. Bottle it, put in a dark place and shake every so often. The longer it sits the better. I lost a bottle for about 4 years, found it and had to fight my mother for it. For a bit of a bonus add a bit of root beer extract. I dont know why but that really worked out. If not that try a almond extract. 

*Neutral into something that tastes like Peach brandy (apparently, I should probably find a better title for this one)

1 large-ish jar of peaches (people say to use fresh, but I was in a rush and the jar'd stuff worked out)
1 lb of brown sugar turned into simple syrup
A few squeezes (probably 2-3 oz) of agave nectar
Top off w/ a neutral liquor (mine was about 85-90 proof)

Add the simple syrup to a pint mason jar, throw in your peaches, fill up to the brim w/ your alcohol, shake, store in a dark place, profit. I gave a jar away after 3-4 days and the test subjects said it tasted like brandy.

*Untested/tasted Fireball (this one is still aging so ymmv, but it smells hella good)

Fill a pint mason jar with dried chilies in alternating layers with marschino cherries, toss 3 sticks of cinnamon in there. To sweeten it up I added a healthy bit of the juice from the cherry jars. Once your jar is full add your liquor, store in a dark place, shake every so often. Like I said in the title I havent tried this one yet, so Ill update this post when I man up enough to give it a taste. 

So all of that being said I want to see what other people do with their shine when they're not drinking it straight. The holidays are coming up and these are super easy (and cheap) gift ideas.

second:  As long as I can figure out how to get the element attached to the pot....does anyone brew beer like this?   Or will I just disconnect, and run the wort with propane, since I use the same pot for both.

I am about to apply for a legal chemical still license (again), without paying any fees, or the $200k bond. You may wonder how, well there is an exception in the Excise Act (Section 134, Subsection 2) which states that if the volume of the still doesn't exceed 23L, than the fees can be waived.

So I'm going to try for it. I filled out the application, and I am also sending in this letter to support the fee exemption.

I have applied before, but I was denied before the application was even really processed because they said the Excise Act, 2001 superseded the Excise Act, and the exception no longer exists. I don't see it this way, and explained it in the letter.

Should the roots/sprouts be left on the kernals?
Should extra sugar/yeast be added? I understand that adding yeast speeds up the process but isn't completely necessary but I'd still like some knowledgeable opinions.

Theoretically when making a pot still, could you mount a thermometer into a keg, and use a sanke coupling to act as the connection to the copper pipe? Does anyone see a problem with this? I'm not sure what temperature the gaskets are rated to.

It's only ever for personal use and never selling it. The only way I can come up with, is getting a proper distilling permit, ramping up production - injecting lots of cash into my distilling and selling it to recoup excise tax on the alcohol I produce. Opposed to a small amount of spirits distilled intermittently for personal use. All this because of 100+ year old laws that haven't been changed!

1349195607.0	10tn1u	Rum and dunder	big_onion	11	0	5	"So I've been making rum for some time now using a really, really simple recipe. I get a gallon of Grade A fancy molasses from Restaurant Depot, mix it with 4 gallons of warm water, pitch some champagne yeast, and let it go to town. I've never had to add anything fancy to it and it usually ferments down pretty dry after a couple weeks. I used feed molasses in the past but it seemed to require too many additives to get a good ferment.

After running, I usually take the backset and put it in a gallon jug (sometimes with an airlock if I have one handy) and let it sit for a couple weeks. I'll add another gallon of molasses to whatever's left in the bucket and then add another 4 gallons of water (reusing that yeast!). When I go to run, I usually add in that gallon of backset (dunder?) and run it with the wash.

I have a feeling this isn't the ""right"" way to do it, so I'm wondering if I could get some input on how to improve this. I *usually* do just a single run through my potstill (and take a lot of careful cuts) since we like that dark rum flavor, although I will do a second run if it needs it (I usually go by taste). Adding the backset/dunder appears to have improved the flavor, but I don't know if that's just me being hopeful. I've done this through about 10 generations. I like to think that I have super yeast in there. Seems like fermentation is done in about a week sometimes.

I make apple brandy from this person's apples every year, but not until october. Not this year. Thank you crazy weather. 
Caught unprepared, here's what I'm working with: 200 pounds of very ripe, slightly wormy winesaps, 75 pounds of sugar, 5 packets of 48 hour turbo yeast, and some year old pectic enzyme. I juiced some apples and got a specific gravity of 1.020. Too low. So i crushed all the apples, divided them into four  20 gallon garbage can/fermenters (white food grade), and added 8 gallons of water to each one, then added about 12 pounds of sugar to each one to raise the SG to 1.060.ten the pectic enzyme to cut down on methanol generation then the turbo. 24 hours later, I have 4 healthy ferments going (boy, does my house ever stink). Ov er the next 48 hours, I'm going to addanother 5 or 6 pounds of sugar to each fermenter. In one week, I'm going to press the mash (while I'm a proponent of fermenting on the pulp, I need it for something else) and then let the resulting wash ferment out for another week or two. The mashed apple solids will go into a 35 gallon fermenter with enough water and sugar to give me a stirrable mash with a SG of 1.060 to 1.080 with the final packet of turbo. This I'll let sit relatively unmolested for a while. I'm guesstimating that to start I'll have eight 5 to 6 gallon stripping runs that will produce 2 gallons of low wines each. If I had my druthers, I'd have used champagne yeast and gotten maybe 1.5 gallons, but I had to act fast. When I strip, I run all the way up to 100C before I shut down. That'll give me two 6 gallon spirit runs that will average 65% ABV and give me 5-ish gallons of product. FINALLY I'll press the second ferment (in my head i call it the grappa run), and it's the wild card. I can never tell how much it'll produce, but I should get 2+ strips, and then 2 spirit runs. This gets mixed with the first run, and in the end I consistently end up with eight or nine gallons of 80 proof apple brandy.  This will be the fifth year in a row from this one little suburban apple tree.

The final step being to put it in an erlenmeyer flask, boil it and measure the vapor temp. As soon as it rises above 160F or so, I would remove the heat source and let it cool back down. Essentially, I believe this would boil off the foreshots. Any thoughts? As for why I want to do this, I want an authentic applejack like they made on the frontier, but without the nasty hangover.	t5_2rcpo	True

Simple to make, delicious.	considerspiders	14	5	24	"I've been hiding out in Germany recently, and I seem to have developed a taste for this stuff, and I talked through the process with a couple of distillers over there (amazing what you can talk about with a handful of common words).

Distill a fine neutral spirit, make your cuts etc, and dilute to 60-70%.  
Freeze the raspberries first to help extraction from the fruit.  
Macerate with as many raspberries as you can cover with the spirit.   
After two weeks of maceration, dilute further to 40% and redistill in a pot still or detuned reflux, running on the pulp if your setup allows it. You shouldn't need to make a heads cut at all - you've already done it in the neutral spirit run. Cut tails to taste but expect to cut very late or even distill to proof. Bottle at 40%.

This is distinguished from a Schnapps / Eaux de vie / fruit brandy because the fruit is not fermented - raspberries have low fermentability. This create a very delicately flavoured white spirit that tastes a lot more like the source fruit than a fermented brandy, where the fruit flavours are changed through fermentation. 

I've used similar methods before for other fruits, and I'm looking forward to trying this with berries. that's the sort of mix I'll be happy to distill on the pulp with a low in my gas fired keg setup as well.

Here was my recipe.

Around 10-20lbs of peaches, halved, stone thrown away and food processed into puree.

5 lbs white sugar

2 lbs brown sugar

1/2 cup corn meal for nutrients.

5 gal water

Bakers yeast.

Fermented like hell for 6 days.  Stopped on day 8 and i strained out all the goop.  

Checked my SG and it dropped to show no sugar left.

Smelled wonderful!  Like fizzy peachy beery goodness.

1368667708.0	1ef8no	Newbie here, need some general advice.	Birdsunderground	11	1	26	"Hey! I've set up my first still (it's nothing terribly impressive). I already ran a batch through of my first pretty weak wash made from white sugar, corn meal, and baker's yeast (I know that's not a good idea). It wasn't much, but I've got the moonshining bug now. I thoroughly enjoyed it (about a pint in total of roughly 80-proof), and now I want to make a proper wash. I've got a list of questions:

1. What is a decent sealant to use on the parts of my still that are leaking steam? I feel I lost a bit to my poor sealing work the first time through.

2. Is vinyl tubing an acceptable replacement for copper?

3. I am using a thumper made from a mason jar, and a drybox made from a gallon milk jug after that, which then leads to the worm. Is this a good idea, or should I just go from boiler to condenser?

4. I have gotten my hands on some real turbo yeast. I plan on making a mash out of horse feed and brown sugar (for a rum-ish taste). Is there a reason not to do this? Also, will this really ferment entirely in 7 days like the packet says? It took about 2 weeks for my last batch to stop bubbling CO2 through the airlock.

5. I've heard not to store alcohol in plastic. Why?

6. Is it possible to let my fermentation chamber run outdoors. I'm thinking insulation around chamber and under a tarp. If so, how can I do this?

7. For flavoring my rum distillate, I want to use allspice, coconut oil, and a pinch of cinnamon. Does anyone have a better idea?

8. I carbon-filtered my shine before drinking. Was that necessary, or rather, a good idea?"	t5_2rcpo	True
1367213366.0	1dbky0	Making Arak.	Canadoz	11	3	11	"Hi folks.  My wife's family is lebanese and I'd like to suprise them with some homemade arak (aniseed liqueur) 

From what I read of the process it consists of triple distillation in a pot still to a final abv of 50-70% with dry aniseed being added to the boiler on the second distilling run.

Traditionally it is made from a white grape fermentation using the native yeast and having tasted some very fine arak, I can confirm that it has a very fruity bouquet and the sweetness of the anise and perhaps of the grapes comes through to make a very pleasant drink. 

I'd like some opinions on whether it's possible to achieve the same results if I begin with a sugar wash or if I'm kidding myself.

My current attempt was to strip a 25l sugar wash down to 90% neutral and then to do several potstill runs using aniseed in the boiler for the first pot run. The result is nowhere near as flavorful and fruity as the Arak I'm comparing to. Any ideas or tips?

1361285580.0	18tijx	The first run is done, lots of information and technical data side about the recipe, fermentation process, pictures, a short video - we got it all!	AthlonRob	11	0	14	"For reference, [here's a PDF](http://www.datafilehost.com/download-c2df5a2a.html) of our data. FYI - You'll probably want to uncheck the check mark on the download page. The recipe we used is in the top left, it's [UJSSM](http://wiki.homedistiller.org/Uncle_Jesse%27s_Simple_Sour_Mash_Method) so nothing super top secret there :) For yeast we used a [Turbo Whiskey with AG](http://www.milehidistilling.com/original-whisky-with-ag/) from Mile Hi Distilling. I was a little disappointed it took 5 days to ferment and not 48 hours, when I was on the phone with Mile Hi for other reasons, I asked about it and it was explained that the 48 hour thing is basically a marketing ploy :) Now we know, ha ha. I was also disappointed we only got 8.9% ABV on the mash, but more on that later.   

In the PDF are  daily notes during the fermentation process, mash temps, specific gravity measurements, pH, on and on. We collected in 8 oz increments in glass quart jars, and measured ABV on each numbered bottle, this data is in the PDF as well.   

[Here is a video of shaking quart 6 of 12](http://www.datafilehost.com/download-93e7ad24.html), nice representation of what the bubbles look like at 90 proof.   

[Here is a video of the methanol burning](http://www.datafilehost.com/download-af990b20.html). It was solid blue at the beginning for a full minute I bet, then got some yellow at the top as you'll see in the video.   

[Some pictures here](http://imgur.com/a/P1X5v) of the rig and the process. The one green bottle is what we measured out our 150 mL (or 5 oz) for methanol, I think everything else is fairly self explained.   

So, on to the questions.   

1. Now that I have discarded the first 150 mL and I have heads, hearts and tails, whats the theory on mixing it all up into 1 container?   

2. What all can I do with the tails? I am tentatively planning on using the last 3 or 4 containers as tails, and putting it in the boiler on the 2nd batch to boost ABV as well as flavor. If I understand correctly, the tails can also be used in a thumper, which I am not using for now. What other uses for tails are there?   

3. Same as #2, but for heads. Heads just gets mixed in with the hearts, right?  

4. Does higher ABV in the mash translate to higher (and more) ABV in the distillate?   

5. How do we get higher ABV in the mash?  

6. What is the criteria to separate heads/hearts/tails?    

7. Would it help ABV to stir the mash a little throughout the fermentation?   

8. Should we try to play with the pH of the mash? Would that affect anything?   

All in all this was a good run, super interesting and fun. It was neat to touch and taste it  during the process as well as seeing the difference in the stages. To be honest with you, around container 4,5 and 6 it was actually pretty tasty :)   

To everyone, thanks for your (on going) help and answers!

1 gallon of Rum Liqueur... The recipe was found in Benjamin Franklin's papers and dates to 1750.

**The original Recipe:**
To a Gallon of Rum two Quarts of Orange Juice and two pound of
Sugar-dissolve the Sugar in the Juice before you mix it with the Rum
-put all together in a Cask &amp; shake it well-let it stand 3- or 4-Weeks &amp;
it will be very fine &amp; fit for Bottlingwhen you have Bottled off the
fine pass the thick thro' a Philtring paper put into a Funnell-that not
a drop may be lost. To obtain the flavour of the Orange Peel paire a few Oranges &amp; put it in Rum for twelve hours-&amp; put that Rum into the Cask with the other-For Punch thought better without the Peel.

**My Version:**

* 5 litres white spirit @ 40%vol, (watered down from 92% w/- distilled water)

* Navy dark rum essence (for 2.25 litres according to the pack) - so I got a light coloured liquid in the end with nice rummy notes,

* Juice of 8 seville oranges,

* Zest of 3 seville oranges,

* 32 grams vanilla bean paste (I find it gives a subtle vanillin note that normally comes with oak aging),

* 500 grams golden syrup,

* 100 grams Tennessee Bourbon Oak chips.

Leave to develop for 3 months, strain, filter, and bottle...
It tastes like a rum based Grand Marnier - more subtle on the orange note, but very tasty and smooth."	t5_2rcpo	True

2. why use a bowl/dome at all? What function does it serve?   

3. how to seal a thermometer/pressure gauge to the top of your keg?   

4. do you really need a pressure gauge?  

5. for easy cleaning, could you cut the entire top off the keg and use a hinge on it? How would I seal the entire 'lid'?   

6. Is it better to have the PSI and thermometer gauge directly mounted to the to of the keg, or better to mount it to the bowl/dome?  

7. How long should it take to finish a single run of 10 gallons of mash?   

8. How do you know when the mash is all gone? A view port towards the bottom of the keg?

9. being a pot still design, this is an open atmosphere system. Do I need any valve's anywhere? I was thinking NO, since it would cause pressure to build.   

10. Do I need any filters of any sort anywhere? I plan on straining the mash before it goes in the keg I did read somewhere about someone putting a filter between my item B and E.   

11. Does the length of pipe between item H and I matter at all?

only use any of this if you're doing reflux.

add only to low wines, when zero yeast is present, when you're about to make your spirit run.

table salt (add 6 oz/40L)--will raise the boiling point of the water, making cuts easier. although you can't use it on SS because it will eat away at it.

sodium bicarbonate (aka baking soda), 1Tbsp/L--it alters the flavour/smell of the heads, making the transition from heads to hearts more discernible. mix it in, stir daily, but do so for a week before doing your final spirit run.

sodium carbonate (4.5g/L)--same as bicarb, but can be added immediately before a spirit run. heard rumour you can get it cheap in the detergent aisle.

I then proceeded to run a mix of 50/50 vinegar/water to test out all my work. 

What's the best way to test for leaks? I've heard of the mirror trick but I didn't have a mirror handy, I just used a piece of glass and checked for fog instead, which helped but it seemed mostly visual (if I saw steam coming out of a joint). 

Even without a gasket around the pot lid, and with 10 binder clips the lid didn't seem to be leaking at all, so that was a good sign. I'd assume for safety reasons I should make a teflon wrapped piece of cardboard as a gasket, but is it necessary? I was planning on doubling the binder clip count up to 20 also.

Now, all my soldered joints including the SS/copper one seemed to be leak free, so that's a good sign. The end of the condenser arm was puking out steam also when it was boiling (with some drips of water also). The first bit was a blue/green which was cleaning up the copper I assume? 

All seemed to be working well except for the brass union at the start of the liebeg condensor that I installed for easy disassembly. The union kind of looks like [this one](http://www.homedepot.ca/product/fitting-copper-union-1-2-inch/959996?oldLookup=Burlington#) except it's brass. I wasn't a huge fan of having brass in my vapor stream so I foolishly tinned the face of the union, which is why I assume it's leaking. Can I sand down the solder off the face, or even flour paste the whole union, or is it better to desolder it and toss it for a new union (which will hopefully be copper as pictured)? If I can't use a union like this, is there any way I can make my condensor arm able to come apart from my column. Are NPT fittings any better?

Thanks guys!

I tried to quickly throw together a cheap fruit wine a few weeks ago with some juice that was about to go bad and it turned out too sweet for me to handle. It has a good amount of alcohol in it though so I figured it might be a good thing to distill. 

I have made a pretty cheap, small electric heated still out of some stuff I have acquired over the past few weeks. I live in a place where it is not exactly legal to make your own spirit. So I figure doing it out in the yard where the neighbors can see is not the best idea. I would like to distill inside but I am worried about the smell. Is it going to reek of strong alcohol in my house all day? The girlfriend won't exactly be pleased if she has to come home to that. 

The last option is to do it in the garage. Again, smell would be an issue but it is easy to ventilate. The only problem with the garage is that it is quite cold in there and I feel that might slow the process down by a bit. 

(Tl;DR) So is it okay to do this inside without any real obvious traces? Or will there definitely be a lot of fumes if I distill in an enclosed place?"	t5_2rcpo	True

1358818518.0	170z1k	Fermenting and exposure of oxygen	AthlonRob	10	1	7	"I seem to be reading 2 different views on exposure to oxygen during the fermentation process.   

The book ""The Compleat Distiller - 2nd edition"" page 21-22 says ""Yeast needs oxygen early in the fermentation process to grow and to produce lipids, which protect the yeast cells from high alcohol levels later in the fermentation. Frequent agitation or aeration of the fermenting fluid during the first 24-36 hours will supply enough, but oxygen should be excluded after this time by use of an airlock.""   

The flip side of this is that exposure to oxygen is ok, and if you're not making a craft scotch or something, it's not that big of a deal. One example is this youtube video of a guy making corn whiskey mash, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1j4oZKPJM0.

Option 1: to use actual chocolate and add alcohol, let it sit for a while to impart flavors then re-distill using a pot still and cut back to 40%
Option 2: Instead of actual chocolate, macerate cocoa powder in alcohol, again re-distill with a pot still. (Alternative method would be to use cocoa powder itself in the column, similar in effect to adding gin botanicals)
Option 3: Mix water and chocolate and distill with a pot still to make a chocolate 'essence'. Then use that to cut the alcohol and give it chocolaty notes (My guess is that you would end up with a weak taste and it'd be more of a scent)
Option 4: Use a mixture of options 1 or 2 and combine that with 3, hopefully giving a full bodied chocolaty spirit.

Me and a mate are looking to get into distilling a little of our own alcohol, and I just have a couple of questions regarding the process. 

Firstly, what is the story with methanol? I know this is a dangerous thing to be present in your alcohol. How does it occur, and most importantly, how does one ensure there isn't any in one's own alcohol?

Secondly, I've watched a few instructional videos about home-distilling, and noticed that people use hydrometers to test the alcohol levels. I have had forays into making my own wine, and have used a hydrometer, but rather than for determining alcohol I have used it to measure soluble solids/sugar (Brix) levels in the wine. How do the hydrometers differ for each of these purposes?

My final question is with regards to how I heat the mash in the distilling process. My original intention was to buy a small portable electric element, however I have noticed that people mainly use wood fires or gas stoves. I am going to be working indoors, so a wood fire is out of the question, however would a gas stove be preferable to electric?

Thanks in advance for any help, and sorry for the wall of questions!"	t5_2rcpo	True

1369340980.0	1excic	Determining the ABV of freeze distilled liquor	CPT_Slaptacular	8	0	13	"I made some Apple Jack / Paint Thinner this past week doing the following:

1 - Made 5 gal of 12% cider.  I got the abv by measuring the OG (1.093) and FG (1.000) of the solution.  I figure about .6 of a gallon of pure alcohol is suspended somewhere in the solution.

2 - Kept the cider at 10° F for two days and took about 2.5 of water ice out of the solution over that time.

3 - I now have 1.5 gallons of strong tasting solution resting to get the strange yeast cloud to settle to the bottom.  By my math - .6 of a gallon of alcohol is still in the 1.5 liquid, and a little loss accounting for me being an idiot, would give me about a 30% ABV.

Here's the sticky part.  I put a calibrated alcometer into a tester and it says that the ABV is under 10%.  I figure this is because there has been no real distillation, but only a concentration.  Is there a way to accurately take a reading of a jacked liquor?  Or am I to rely on the math of volumes?"	t5_2rcpo	True

1364393187.0	1b3yuv	Hello to all, and a few questions	Canadoz	8	0	23	"Hi everybody, My name's Canadoz, I'm pretty new around here and for the past couple weeks I've been reading just about everything on the subject  I can get my hands on. (forums, guides, those books by John Stone, etc.)  I'm feeling like I'm getting close to having as much of handle as is possible on the theory involved without firing up a still and trying out what I've learned. 

 
That's still a little ways off though, as I'm still procuring equipment and ingredients. (For one, it's a hell of a hard thing to find the 50L SS keg I have my heart set on for a boiler) 

My main question at the moment is this. I've bought a Reflux column assembly. But I'm getting the impression that these are best suited to making high purity white spirits, with little or none of the taste of the wash carried through to the finished product.

If I want to make a molasses and raw sugar wash based rum, and retain some of the flavors in it, is there a way to do that with a reflux still?

The column I've bought has no valve between the reflux column and the condenser column, is that a handicap in any way? Will it hinder my ability to make accurate cuts, or any helpful adjustments to a run? would there be any advantage to refitting it to incorporate one?

The column I have is designed so that I can plumb water to run through the condenser and then into the reflux coil in a contiguous loop, and I've noticed people talking about bypassing the reflux coil waterflow and removing the packing which essentially allows it to be run as a pot still.

One other thing, What is the maximum possible alcohol % possible through fermentation alone? If I work with 25L fermenters, what kind of volume of finished product  @ 40% alc/vol that I could expect to see? (either diluted back down or extracted at that percentage)


I think I've rambled a bit, but any tips or insights would be appreciated.


Cheers.

Moonshine

3 kg (7 lb)crushed grain 

4.5 kg (10 lb) sugar 
Do I steep the grains, or take the water and grains and just toss in with the dissolved sugar and yeast?   OR pour a few gal of boiling water into the grains and let it steep?   I think this goes with the crushed or flaked corn as well.

In brewing beer, you convert the grain starches into sugars by letting it sit at 150F for 20 min or so.  Should I be doing the same?   But in the first bit of that website, it just says add 4"" of all grain feed, and warm water to melt the sugar, and let it go with the yeast.  Why the difference of grain process?

1364654340.0	1bax7z	Update on a really bad idea: TSC's Producer's Pride all stock sweet feed run.	CarbonGod	8	2	11	"So, as others had said....don't bother.   However, some say it's fine.  That is for you to decide.

So, started off with the normal sweetfeed recipie.  4"" of feed, 6lbs sugar, boiled 2 gallons of water, and let it steep in the mix for 20min.  Ended up with half a brewing bucket of freaking MUSH.   Added more warm water and stirrred the best I could until I got to 6gal.

Added EC1118, and let it sit.

Bubbles for a few days, I mixed the crap up for the first 2 days.   One bucket had a few inches of liquid on the top, the other had the mush, so I added a bit more water.   

I racked after it seemed to slow fermenting....got 5gallon paint strainer sacks (or all-grain brew-in-bag sack), put it over spare bucket, and poured the slop in there.  Second time I did it, I put a few small jars on the bottom, to keep the sack off the bottom.  This allows SOME to drain into the bucket.

That is not fun, squeezing 5 gallons of mush that smells like vomit.  Second bucket I did it in smaller batches, transffering all liquid from both ferments into one bucket.   At this time, I took the rest of the bag over to my neighbor and gave it to him to feed his chickens.

SO, after straining out a ton of crap, I had about 5.5gallons of foul liquid.   Let it ferment a few days more, then cold crashed it.
Also, let me mention....there is GRAVEL in pellet sweetfeed.  At the bottom of the fermenters, there were a few ounces of grey sand on the bottom.   I'm a little pissed, but I also don't know the standard for animal feed....it might help (roughage)....

SO, on to distilling.
Went quick.  I don't knot he SG or FG due to it being a weird set of fermenting liquids/solids.   I got 1/2 gallon of spirit down to tails or 40%. I gave up since the taste was very....umm....sick tasting.  Mixed together was 50%.   I didn't get more than 60% off the run, which is odd.   Anyway, proofed down to 45% and got 3/4 gallon spirit.

Will let open for a few days, i heard that if all this vomit smelling crap is the alfalfa, it might air out.   Granted, I'm also a rum-boy, so I don't know what whiskey/shine is supposed to taste like.

In short, it's not the worst tasting stuff I've made.  It takes some getting used to.  However, it's NOT worth the work, as others have mentioned.   If you find out your bag is pellets, take it back.   

Next up for me.  cracked corn.  Can't screw that up, can ya?

**TLDR:** Producer's Pride All Stock Sweet Feed is pellets, smells like shit, brews like shit, and produces very little.  Don't even bother thinking you can do it :)

Of course we all know it's against federal law to distill your own liquor. That part is pretty cut and dry, but I'm looking for more information, more specifics.   

1. What are the repercussions of transporting illegal liquor? I read the article posted here about 2 guys in North Carolina that got caught by the Sheriff for speeding, and had 24 gallons of liquor. They got 2 misdemeanors apiece if I remember right.        

2. What are the repercussions of drinking illegal liquor?     

3. What are the repercussions of having possession of illegal liquor?       

4. Based on the above 3 questions, is there some quantity that makes it worse? Like, 9 gallons is a misdemeanor but 10 gallons is a felony?  

5. What laws do you violate? tax laws, FDA food production laws, transportation laws?    

6. I watched the season end of the TV show Moonshiners (I know, I know, don't shoot me, lo). During that show, they said that the act of producing the liquor was illegal. just owning a still wasn't, that the police had to catch them actually making it. is that true? That's why I ask question 3.   

7. If the group of men and women in this subreddit are asking and answering questions about illegal activities, why aren't the law enforcement types arresting all of us (in the US) right now? I think the answer is that we're all making it for our own consumption, but still wondering.

My questions are:
1) To flavour the batch without using the essence packs can I use jolly ranchers hard candy? If so, how long would it take to dissolve the candy in a batch with roughly 20% alcohol?
2) With the alcohol being around 20% can I use t-top corks (like the ones used on grand marnier/porto style drinks) to keep the Liquor Quik? Will it keep for a long time?

I'm using a distillers yeast (Saccharomyces I think) it'll get the mash between 25 and 30 percent and I'm running a basic sugar wash. Being a student I broke down sugars yield to alcohol using some basic chemistry formulas. My math points to 4.3 lbs of sugar per gallon, expecting a 30 percent yield.  Also I'm using a 10,000mL boiling flask and a basic 3/8'' copper condenser for a still.  I can produce a 170 proof product but it's a little hot and rough.

1357494828.0	162hh3	On yeasts, and fermentation times.	NotDFU	8	0	12	"I'm looking for some first-hand experience in the use of different yeasts, and fermentation times.

There seems to be a standard warning about fermenting too long, that undesirable flavours will be produced (Scotch fermentations range from about 48hrs to 140hrs). However, whisky producers tend to use whisky yeasts which are known for high (if not total?) attenuation and low cogener production.

Beer makers, however, let their brews go through conditioning/secondary fermentation to produce desireable flavours (and remove undesireables).

I've tried a 60hr and 140hr all-malt fermentation with a whisky yeast (1.080 down to 0.998) both of which didn't have any nasty flavours, but I wonder if some more interesting flavours could be created by using a fruity ale yeast, and 3-4 week fermentations using proper beer-making techniques (which are pretty different from those of whisky producers, actually).

Has anyone done this, or are we all just taking others' words for it?

I ask because there seems to be a general complaint about whiskies produced 30-50 years ago being a whole lot more interesting than those today, about the same time distillers switched to whisky yeasts....

Given that (I think?) the metho is the first to boil off, does that mean I've just made 3L of metho and not alcohol? 

I set aside ~300ml of heads and maybe 200ml of tails but the remaining stuff doesn't smell/taste much different. Though I'm not sure. My tongue seems to give slightly different results to others that try my stuff.

Can anyone give me some guidance?"	t5_2rcpo	True
1355732161.0	14zhl8	How to improve condenser performance?	rj3d	9	2	15	"I have a 26 inch long leibig condenser that I use with a keg boiler. Currently my runs take me about 5 hours from start to finish as I can only knock down about 30 ml/1 ounce of vapor per minute. This rate is perfect for spirit runs, but is starting to get annoying for stripping runs. I'm thinking I need to either get a new pump, improve my condenser design, or both. My pump is rated at ~300 GPH with no head and is rated to a maximum head height of ~7 ft. I'm running it with a head height of ~ 3 feet. Would a better pump improve my maximum knockdown rate? Also, I'm thinking of disassembling the condenser and crimping the vapor tube along the lines of [this](http://www.artisan-distiller.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=6261), although I would prefer not to unless I'm going to see a drastic improvement.

1307330852.0	hsk02	An educational failure	gjbloom	8	1	7	"I decided to create what I call a soylent green sugar wash.  I figured that commercial yeast has been provided with all the best nutrients by the company who raised them, so why not just lyse about 3/4 of the yeast in a 2 lb brick for the remaining yeast to cannibalize?  Should be cheaper than using turbos or even regular yeast plus commercial nutrients.  

So I did just that - hydrated 1.5 lb of a 2 lb brick of red star, that goes for $6 at CostCo.  I put the hydrated yeast in the freezer to bust open the cells an spill their yummy nutritious guts.  I made a sugar wash of 10 lb sugar per 4x 5 gallon buckets, and added 8 gm citric acid per bucket to keep the yeast happy and the bacteria unhappy.

I was pleased at the vigor of the fermentation.  It had pretty much completed after 5 days, but I let it sit for 14 days.  The sugarwine had a good flavor, and three of the four buckets tasted nice and dry.  One of them still had noticable sugar, but was pretty much dry.  (If you were a high-school student looking for 20 gallons of cheap wine, this would be just the ticket at a little over $1/gallon of 15% alcohol).

Then I did a stripping run.  Seemed like there were more heads than usual, but being a stripping run I kept everything that came over.  Then I diluted to 50% and did a slow spirit run.  The heads seemed like they'd never end, and even before the heads were done, I started tasting tails.  Ay-yi-yi.  I ended up keeping the middle part of the run, despite the heads and tails flaws in it, and rested these fake hearts on active carbon for a week, hoping for luck.  They improved some, but not enough, so today I did another spirit run to try and get a better separation.  No dice.  So now I've got a couple gallons of vile-tasting not-so-neutral ethanol that'll just have to be made into windshield-washer fluid or something.

I guess the moral of the story is - there's just no substitute for good yeast nutrient.  When I consider the time and materials wasted, I could probably use the finest turbos for all my remaining distilling runs and still not cost as much as this failed run.  (I hate to imagine the heartbreak a microdistiller must face on having a several hundred gallon failed batch).

The ones on ebay seem to be 0-25% or 0-80% (less accurate I'm guessing?).  Is 80% high enough, and I should ""never"" collect anything above that?  Is there something better to be using?


Full version:

I currently stick to a strict recipe for my rum and have almost the exact same results every time.  PotStillin will shake his head and possibly shout, but I've had excellent luck with volume based takeoffs.  I measure afterwards with my spirit hydrometer and wouldn't you know, it comes out within 1-2% of the same every single time.  Call it luck, call it stableness of process, call it whatever, but it works :)

The problem is I want to start experimenting.  This means I need to be more accurate in my cuts.  I know that you can go by taste, but that's just not how I work right now.  I'm very pedantic, and like to pick a number and stick with it, adjusting that number to tune.

Because I do 20L fermentations, I wind up with about 1.5L of spirit in the end.  Taking 100ml or so samples with the spirit hydrometer really doesn't ""cut"" it (ha!) with runs that small."	t5_2rcpo	True

And the Turbo Air doesn't require water hooked up to it. The reason I'm deciding between these two is because I work at a store that carries them and get a substantial discount on them.

1. Does anyone have experience with Maple Syrup fermentation that can caution me about possible hang-ups?

3. Should I use a different yeast? I'm using the Whiskey Pure because I had to buy a kilo of it from Mile High Distilling to finish a UJSSM run last month, as it was the only option at the time.

My thinking is that the alcohol slows down the rate at which the temperature rise in your still. Say you apply heat and the entire wash begins to increase in temp, once the temp hits 65C you start getting the head of your run. So once the alcohol starts to vaporize it pulls heat from the wash, in doing so keeps the temperature constant until the wash runs out of Methanol. Then the wash beings to heat up to the boiling point of Ethanol and again levels out until that is removed. So on and so forth until your are left with water.

The [panty dropper method](http://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=2199) is a classic. Works great for almost any fruit for a sweetened liqueur. Popular with the ladies. I've done strawberry, rasberry, boysenberry (runner up), blackberry, red current (favourite), mango (failed) and you can do almost anything.

Some good apple pie recipes in [here](http://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=6924)

My personal favourite macerated liqueur is the [Thai Terror](http://www.artisan-distiller.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.PHP?f=5&amp;t=291).

Limoncello is very easy if you can get yourself some, say, 65% neutral or eaux de vie - just take the zest of some lemons (no white stuff), soak a few weeks, strain, then dilute with a simple syrup to say 35%. Add a touch of food grade glycerin for an amazing mouthfeel.

Krupnik is great - highly recommended for a kind of smoother, cleaner drambuie. I make it drier and stronger than [this recipe](http://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=6713487#p6713487) though.

An [espresso vodka](http://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=14489) is very achieveable, and most good, so is a [kahlua type thing](http://homedistiller.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=8357)

Brewhaus makes an induction pot (or at least you can order one from Smiley's), and it seems the faster and safer way to go.

does anybody have any recommendations on which one to get? otherwise i'll just go with whatever Brewhaus recommends. also, is it difficult to remove the thermometer from it so that it doesn't cycle, or would you recommend that whatever-it-is unit to prevent the cycling?

anything else you'd recommend before i jump to spending the money and finally get into this?

edit: upon more research, Brewhaus' milk can style kettle will fit on an induction burner. but their induction-ready pot is on their premium kettle, which won't fit. some overlap won't effect the cooking, so i'll put some kind of block under it for stability. a 1500W induction burner supposedly boils at 15 minutes per gallon.

and don't get a glass-top induction burner, as it won't hold 50 lbs. i'll cross my fingers that a ceramic top is more durable. if not, then i'll have a really expensive way to boil my water for coffee in the morning.

Would one want to conduct a sour mash across multiple generations or just create a fresh ingredient ferment each time? I'm a little unsure on when a sour mash is recommended or what even the benefit is.

Second question:
Is doing multiple stripping runs followed by a single spirit run always needed for a recipe like this? Just a personal preference?

SpiritusFrumenti	7	2	11	I was wondering if it is possible to use salt water to cool a reflux still (Cooled through a water jacket) made of stainless steel or copper.

The net result is that the ice melts more and more slowly after the initial addition of salt.  My question is will it damage the still, or is it just not worth the effort?  I’ve read a lot of people who use pumps to circulate water use a lot of ice jugs to cool the water, and I would like to try to cut down on the amount of ice I need to use.

Subsequently this is my very first reddit post, so bear with me. Note here that I have never created a still or attempted to use one. I understand there are risks and have been on several sites including homedistiller.org, this subreddit, and a few other sites to help plan my build. 

I've been putting it off for a while for fear of not fully understanding how to build one or what all is involved. I figured you guys might be able to help me put off some of them and answer specific questions I couldn't find much information.

*Please note again, I've never done anything like this. I'm completely new to the distilling/shining world and I've come here to ask questions I felt had incomplete answers on other sites.

So here are a few of my concerns and questions:

I plan on building [this](http://homedistiller.org/image/mini_explained.jpg) type of still. As I understand it the cooling element is at the top and the slanted plates catch the condensed vapors as they rise, and the condensed spirit escapes out of the valve. Is that a good basic understanding of a reflux still?

* Is there a minimum length I should consider when building this type of still? 
* How close should the slanted plates be to the condenser? 
* Everyone seems to have a fancy valve to control flow of spirits leaving the still, how simple/intricate does it need to be?
* Temperature control, how do I do that?

I'm having trouble understanding some of the process of distilling. I understand there is a point at with your *mixture* must boil in order to produce. 

* When heating mash do you simply blast the heat until the mixture boils or bring it up to a boil slowly?
* Do you measure this mixture temperature directly? Basically do you have a thermometer in the mixture itself?

Last question:
I read for one recipe of mash that for a 20L run you throw out the first 50-100ml. 

* If I made a smaller run, say about 10L, would I still want to get rid of the same amount of head to prevent methanol getting into my final product? 

I understand that a lot of the stigma about methanol in the distilling world isn't as bad as folks say it is, but it is still a real danger and being so new to this I figure better safe that sorry to ask about this.

Right now I basically want to make sure that I know how the still posted in the link above works. I think that's a reasonable first still to create and I would enjoy making it. Any advice, criticism, chastisements are welcomed. "	t5_2rcpo	True

I've been saving my money, though, and together my friend and I have found some time and a great space to actually pursue this. The goal is to start small, but to do things logically so that we have the option to build on what we do as we move along. We've already looked into getting all the appropriate permits and certifications to do things legally, but I'd really appreciate some practical advice on how feasible/manageable a task it is to build and maintain a slightly-above-amateur-level still. Can someone with almost no welding experience hope to cobble together something worthwhile without heaps of expensive abandoned attempts? How much capital would you recommend having before we move forward? Is it even possible to break even?

I've read a lot of the resources online about distilling (and there are tons of amazing ones thanks to some of you), but I'm hoping a couple of you guys have been in this exact position and can help provide a path to help us focus on the important things.

Instead, is it at all practical to further distill cheap vodka (40% alcohol) up to 95% alcohol? I understand the basic principle is that ethanol boils at ~78ºC, while water boils at 100ºC. Heat up a litre of cheap vodka to just over 78º, collect the condensed vapor, and you should have nearly pure ethanol. Right?

Or is this impractical? Obviously you'll want to monitor the temperature carefully and probably use a non-flame heat source just in case. I recall a setup like this from chemistry class - it seems like something that could be done at home?

http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/solut/solut-images/distillapp-plain.jpg

**UPDATE**

I purchased an 8 litre, stainless steel, 3x transducer @ 480W ultrasonic cleaner and zapped 6 litres of 40% ABV neutral spirit (that was about three weeks old already) at ~50Khz for an hour.  Starting temp was 19 Degrees C and after an hour of cavitation, it had climbed to 43 Degrees C. The device had an inbuilt heater, but I left that turned off.

After waiting for it to return to room temperature and using an additional sample of the original 6 litres as a control, there was absolutely no doubt that the taste of the zapped vodka was discernably smoother.

I then ran 6 litres of neutral spirit flavoured with Still Spirits Tennessee Bourbon essence for an hour and included (as I read in one patent application suggesting 5gr of oak chips per litre) 30 grams of toasted oak chips. Temp was a bit higher this time after an hour - reaching 52 Degrees C.

Again - after allowing it to return to room temp the finished result tasted discernably smoother and there was a clearly increased ""Oak flavour"" that the ultrasonics had imparted too...

In case I was being biased, I gave a buddy a blind tasting - and his comments mirrored mine....

It's a 5qt metal pot (best I can tell), with a food grade (obviously) teflon lining and a glass lid. The lid has a 5/32"" hole in the center from where the handle used to be mounted. I'm thinking I can just drop some 1/4"" copper tubing down that hole and seal it, bring the tubing up and into a coil to condense. I figure I'd seal the lid and the tubing with either PTFE tape or flour dough.

I'm sure I won't get great results from this, but I think I can pull it off for about $20 (flexible 1/4"" copper tubing, plus however I do the condenser)

-maybe too hot (we had triple digit weather yesterday and high 90s the days before) but I doubt that's the reason because I have a rum wash (8lbs sugar/4gal water, tablespoon of DAP) that is fermenting super quickly

I've read a lot on Homedistiller and Aussiedistiller but there is so much and so varied information out there i'm a little confused.

My plan is to heat pH 5.5 approx adjusted water to about 77C, and add cracked corn at 3 parts water to 1 part corn ratio - this should cool the temp to around 67C where i'll add some alpha amylase during the hydration of the corn which should resemble thick porridge at this point. Turn heat off and allow the mix to sit for an hour retaining as much heat as possible. This is my  'cooking ' phase.
 Then reheat back to 67C and add further amylase, mixing, and again wait an hour. By this point the mixture should have thinned out as the amylase does it's thing reducing the starches to fermentable sugars.
If the mixture tastes sweet/ish at this point - into the fermenter it goes with the corn bits and all, add some sugar to adjust SG to get about 12% potential ABV.

I figure if I get no conversion, at worst its a UJSSM. At best its some/all conversion and a modified UJSSM (partial mash plus sugar head).

Before I distill these I wanted to clarify dunder for myself. HD.org seems to have a little controversy and I'm at work so I can't do a lot of research. 

Is dunder for a rum wash just any foam from the wash or what's left in my boiler after my run?
Also, how do I store my dunder for my next run if it is going to be a few weeks before my next batch is ready.

Thanks guys!

I'm confused slightly on the job corn does.   You can throw corn and sugar together, and the corn just acts as tastes and maybe nutrients.

or you can cook the corn to convert it, and throw in malted grains for enzymes for a sugar conversion.   However, when do you add the grains (say, 6 row)? 

I've read that you cook/mash the corn at 180 for an hour or so, cool to 150, add grains, and theeeeen?  wait another hour, then add water?  What about sparging?  do I ferment on the grain?  Should I bag the corn and grains and ferment in bag (which is easier in the end i guess)

Blah...thought it would be easy, but reading makes me more wondering what I can do, an SHOULD do.   I don't think I want to do a sugar wash with corn flavor....I feel that damnit, I have a grain, I should USE it.

I'm not sure the chips will really impart the Bourbon-like flavor I'm hoping for. They are made from ground up charred white oak barrels, and I do see some bits of char on some of them, but proper bourbon has to penetrate a layer of char to interact with the inner oak wood. I was thus thinking it best to attempt to char the chips myself before using them, but I don't know how to do this and Google just seems to only direct me to DIY charcoal information. What i think I need are just surface charred bits, not coal.

Unfortunately, after assembling all of my still parts it's 9 feet tall! (1 ft for burner, 3 ft for keg, 4 ft for column, 1 ft for plates &amp; condenser.) Not only is this height annoying for operation and assemble, but it makes the still even harder to hide in my relatively open yard. 
I was wondering what kind of effect decreasing the high of the column would have of my product. If I were to cut the column high to 3' or possibly 2', would it have a significant impact on my run time and purity? The idea seems that I would have to run slower to get the same purity.

We recently upgraded from a basic 3 gallon pot still to an 8 gallon stainless steel pot still with a copper condenser. We have a sweet feed recipe fermenting in three 5 gallon fermentors which produces a mash of about 15 gallons. Our question is if we do the first run with 8 gallons and then set the distillate aside, clean the still and run the remaining 7 gallons collect that distillate, clean out the still and combine the distillate from both runs for our final run would that work?

I've switched from clean distiller's yeast to estery ale yeasts with lower yields in search of more flavour.

So, has anyone experimented with different strains of malt? I know the Scotch distilleries like Optic, Golden Promise, and Chariot, but I know that once a distillery picks a strain, they're compelled to stick with it for consistency.

I'm looking for lots of flavour. I tend to like bready malty sweetness, but anything interesting is great. Standard homebrew 2-row (I've been using Gilbertson and Page Canadian 2-row) is about $60 for a 50lb bag whereas Golden Promise is $100. Is there a noticeable difference?

I am about to built my first still head, and my dreams really can come true because I have a friend who has access to as much copper pipe and fittings as I need (no sheets, or I’d do a too.) I’ve read a couple books, studied the science and temps, and I want to get rolling!

I want to go with a boka design for a couple reasons:
•	I understand it has a forgiving learning curve.
•	I can remove the packing and run it has a pot still (might include a quick-detach feature.)
•	It appears to be slightly more mobile than most designs, which is important to me because I am younger and will be jumping around between apartments for the next few years, I’m sure.

I am interested in making corn whiskey and vodka. I am sure I’d like to get into rums, monkeyshine, and kinkier stuff as my skills improve, but presently that is where my heart is. I will probably be using the popular design here:

http://homedistiller.org/image/drawing_01_simple_updraft_SU.jpg

One area that I am in still up in the air on is the boiler. While I would love to build one, I think my first will be something modified. I would love to jump right into it with a 15 gal keg + internal electrics, but I would rather start with something stove-top until I find a garage of my own, in which case I might just run propane. Money and welding ability are my limitations. 

With this design in either “mode,” would there be a limit as to the size of a stove-top boiler? Can I actually boil a keg on a stove with around five gallons mash, or am I being an idiot?

When making whiskey, what would the downsides be to using this head as opposed to a liebig (my only other consideration?)

I understand there have been some modifications and improvements to this design, any experience or recommendations with them?

I really am going to take my time and build something versatile I can hone the craft with.  I’ve wanted to do this since high school, and I guess the good ol’ boy in me can’t let this dream die. Thank you in advance for your help and answers!

edit:thank you for the input, it appears that overwhelmingly people say it's pectin. it's the best answer i've heard to date, i wasn't aware that pectin carried over in the distillation process but i will try what iissqrtneg1 suggested, and also the chill filtering to get rid of my product already made. The main reason that i didn't think it was something like this was because it remained clear until the distilled water was added, but perhaps it was adding the water that initiated a chemical reaction with the pectin that caused the haze like losjellybones said. Thank you everyone for your imput, i'm just a simple moonshiner, but i'm always trying to improve my product, and you've all been a great help."	t5_2rcpo	True
1344439175.0	xvu8v	Need some pot still advice	Adolf_Hipster2	5	0	9	"I've been researching for weeks on making whiskey with a pot still and I think I have a decent design nailed down, however I have a couple questions before I finalize my build. 

I don't have ready access to copper larger than 1"" diameter (and even 1"" is ungodly expensive) so will this limit how big my pot should be? My basic design is a 2 - 3 foot column, a 90 degree elbow followed by a 45 degree and a 1"" to 1/2"" reducer and a good 3 foot of 1/2"" pipe surrounded by a 1"" water jacket for cooling. I have to use my electric stove rather than a propane burner as I have no where out doors to run the still without being right in the open. My stove would take days to heat a full 5 gallons, so would it be wise to go with a smaller pot and shoot for a 2.5 gallon run?

Last question is securing the rig to the lid. What materials should I avoid? The method I'm leaning towards is using an iron pipe fitting that has a large flange on one side with holes I could bolt into the lid of my pot, and its threaded on the other side (think closet rod holder), however I'm sure theres a reason no one is building with iron pipe or pvc...

I have never distilled before, but have done plenty of beer brewing, and will be buildng a pot still soon. I will most likely be brewing in 5 gallon batches, but I haven't decided on the capacity of my still yet (should I run 5 gal at a time, or split it up?). I mainly have recipe/ingredient questions:

1) What kind of OG should I be looking at? Should I try to boost it with additional sugars or malt extracts, or should my wort resemble that of a reasonable gravity beer?

2) what sort of yeast should I use? Should I stick to an ale yeast, or shoot for a wine yeast with higher alcohol tolerance? Are there any whiskey/liquor specific yeasts that you would recommend?

3) I probably won't be able to afford a barrel, or even fill it. I know of people using oak chips to flavor wine, and would imagine that I can use them for getting that tasty whiskey flavor. Is there any rule of thumb for adding oak chips or peat moss to flavor whiskey this way?

I find this rather interesting, so I had a quick google around and tried to find some information on it, all i could find was an article on pop science with some poorly explained chemistry and a study on pub med about ultrasonic treatment resulting in a faster metabolism of alcohol(which piques my interest even more). Basically from what I gather is that the energy transferred to the distillate causes fewer water molecules to surround each ethanol molecule creating a smaller molecular cluster. Now, in the pop. sci. article, the author has gone on to say that it promotes esterification of various substances to create flavor profiles. Is my understanding correct? If not can you please correct me and also explain if their is an ability to promote formation of certain esters other than trial and error(although it would be a lot easier to add the ester after this process) Going to x-post to r/chemistry as well.	t5_2rcpo	True

Once we have it down pat we will be doing a 3-4L run once per two months. 

We were considering getting a 10-15L oak barrel and then doing a 1L solera (immediately bottling the other 2-3L). 

Anyone tried this, any thoughts?


For anyone not familiar with solera, how it works is you fill a barrel (gradually or all at once, assume one big run for us talking) with spirit. 

Once full, every X time you remove Y% and replace it with new. This means your average aging asymptoticly approaches a known value based on X and Y. 

For example, with a 10L barrel, if once per month I take out 1L and put in a fresh 1L my age will approach 18 months (x = month, y = 10%). 

Obviously it's only 1 month old thr first month, 1.9 months the second, 2.71 months the third, etc.

Apparently, the safety feature in the plate keeps turning on which actually turns off the hot plate for a while to keep the heat down. Unfortunately, this makes distilling a VERY long process, as in, 18 damn hours. The plate will get to the temperature it needs to be at, but then the safety tells it to turn off which makes my wash stop boiling and needing to be heated back up again. As you may imagine, this whole process is quite frustrating. 

I hear that you can actually safely mod the hot plate to keep it at a constant temperature without putting the hot plate in danger of overheating or anything. Could anyone help me on finding some good directions as to how to do this? My electrician knowledge is very limited.

Using a small diameter can give you much, much more condensation area per volume, as well, and the reflux flow is slow but unimpeded for the entire length of the still.

Properly insulated, this could provide a smaller temperature gradient along the vapor path, maybe like 4 degrees per foot using a 10' coil compared to 10 degrees per foot with a 4' packed column.

I notice that when I dilute my products I sometimes get precipitants that eventually collect at the bottom of the jar/bottle. It is my understanding that these are ""fusels"" and I have drastically reduced them by making better cuts.

Oak infusions (~70% in a 1 gallon jar with 2 cups of oak chips for a month or two) introduce more dissolved materials which fall out of solution when diluted as well; so I have learned to remove large particles (ss mesh) then dilute and allow things to settle BEFORE filtering. 

Not sufficiently filtering these out has resulted in post consumption morning urine which smells strongly of a campfire, this doesn't seem good at all.

Currently I use coffee filters for filtration, but I'm looking for an alternative; I feel like the filters themselves may contribute to the problem and something better is probably out there. Most of the alternatives I see are carbon filtration methods, what do you guys use??

Recently I decided to try distilling again. I haven't done any since college (that still involved a glass bottle, lots of copper tubing, a hot plate and and an old refrigerator -- very sketchy).

So I have a nice little Brewhaus reflux still, and my first run worked very nicely -- it distilled out to bit more than 80%, but I'd like to get a bit more rigorous. Right now, I'm using a glass thermometer and tweaking the cooling water to keep the temperature right where I want it. It occurred to me that I could use my current thermostat and probe to switch the hotplate I'm heating with on and off to control the temperature within a degree or two. Set it at 170ºF and run it until the heads are gone and then reset it to about 175ºF for the rest of the run.

My still is only 3 gallons (I live in a city and need to distill in my apartment). I fermented 5 gallons of mash for two 2.5gal stripping runs.

To my understanding, it's not necessary to make any cuts in a stripping run since you'll distill it all again and make careful cuts in the spirit run. However, I went ahead and made cuts every 500mL or so anyhow just out of curiosity to try to distinguish between heads hearts and tails.

Here's my question: I have collected a 1L jar of 120 proof distillate. This is the strength at which I want to age the bourbon. This distillate came after the first 150 or so mL of heads.

I would love something that could, at the high end, make a few gallons at a time, but at the low end, only put out a few fifths of experimental batches.

I'm am using [this blueprint](http://i.imgur.com/73OOD.png), which I found on the web. There was a whole [.pdf](http://www.amazingstill.com/se/Plastbrannaren.pdf), however, it's in swedish.

... for essential oils, and I have some engineering questions which require your collective expertise.
 
I have an aluminum 30 qt. deep fryer with a basket that should work fine for holding biomass. My plan is to punch a hole in the lid large enough for a 1/2"" x 6"" black iron pipe, turn and go horizontal for 3 feet, and then turn again vertically, where my copper condenser ( 24"" length, 1/2"" copper inside, 3/4"" copper outside) will be attached pointed directly towards the ground. 

My questions are, will the long horizontal run be detrimenal? I know that the iron pipe doesn't have very good thermal conductivity, so I'm assuming that it will just act as a fractionator (sp?), and there shouldn't be much heat loss. Hell, I could probably insulate it if I really wanted to. 

Second question, how in the world would I seal the connection between the iron pipe and the aluminum lid? I bought washers, nuts, and gasket material, and I have some high temp silicone paste in a tube. I just wonder if there is an easier way to do it, because I can't really think of a simple solution that could be had by a trip to Lowe's.
  
Anyway, I figured you guys might have some helpful suggestions, although I am not making ethanol. Essentially, I'm just building a water still, but adding biomass to the boiling flask (orange peels, lavendar, herbs and such). "	t5_2rcpo	True

1375040398.0	1j8b2d	Steam distillation of grappa using an aluminum stock pot as Bain Marie?	McSology	2	0	8	"Howdy Firewater!

I just started working at a distillery about a month ago, and have primarily been making vodka since I started.  We are gearing up for the upcoming grappa season, and for the previous seasons, we have been using an Al-ambiq 500 liter copper pot still using a colander-looking insert to steam distill the wine pomace to make grappa. 

My research has shown that a more consistent, higher quality product can be made from using the bain marie method, rather than direct heat. The colander insert looks like it will keep the bottom from scorching, but it sits rather low in the kettle, and I'm thinking that aside from the sides scorching, that using the insert might be a real pain when it comes to removing all the cooked pomace.

So, I'm thinking about using a huge commercial stock pot with steamer basket to make removal of the pomace easier, and to have the benefits of bain marie steam distillation. Aluminum 200 qt stock pots are quite a bit cheaper than stainless (can't even find high-capacity copper stock pots on the commercial market).

My question is:

Will an aluminum bain marie  that is inside of a traditional copper alembic kettle likely cause any problems with the quality of the distillate? I do know that there are aluminum pressure cookers available which are rated to withstand temperatures much higher than 100 Deg C and are rated as food safe so there shouldn't be an issue with aluminum toxicity. 

The vapors will be primarily in contact with the copper interior of the kettle, bell, swan, and worm.... should be all good right?

Thanks!

My question is how big to make the thump keg, how much tails to put in it and what kind of result I should be expecting.

The first is that I've come across a fairly old copper 'beating bowl' 12 1/2"" across and solid copper, which I'm considering using as the head of my still, but I'm conflicted because it would also be useful to me in its current state as a mixing bowl for egg-based recipes, and these aren't easy to come across. I like the idea of a copper head unit because it eliminates any need to solder to stainless, and give a huge surface area of copper to bind up off flavour causing chemicals, I'm just not sure its worth putting a hole in a hard to find piece of kitchen ware for.

I'd ideally like to work out a design that won't overwhelm my small apartment kitchen, while having good output levels, preferably a reflux/pot still combo that can run in either mode with some basic switching out of parts. I already know I want to go with a liebig or shotgun style condenser in pot-still mode, and I like the cold-finger double helix condenser style for a reflux setup since its so compact and effective. I'm planning to use a fountain pump and bucket setup for condenser water, I'm just not sure whether I want to go with a design with a minimal length permanent column that can be unpacked to switch to pot still operation, or a section of column that is only installed for reflux operation and removed for pot-still mode. My concern is that a removable column increases cost since I'd need unions or tri-clamps to connect it in an airtight manner, and a short permanent column may impair reflux operation.

So given that I want to keep size and cost as low as I can without sacrificing too much on reflux operation, which way do those of you more knowledgeable than me recommend?"	t5_2rcpo	True

Worked great, wasn't too sweet as expected, wasn't syrupy at all. Now, after using a funnel to get it into a bottle and putting it in a dark cupboard the cap is under a lot of pressure and opening it gives the hiss and rising foam of pop. I really hope it isn't because I've got no idea what to do if it is, but is this secondary fermentation and if so how long have I got to drink it before I either can't or wont want to?

Edit:
After a few hours it's starting to smell vinegaresque and there's about half an inch of sediment at the bottom, I'm guessing it was contaminated and throwing it away."	t5_2rcpo	True

It's 16 lbs sugar in 6 gallons, and I'll probably do three batches, distill from 18 gallons to 6 on the first run, and then down to about 3 on the second distillation.

Which of the three options is best:

  •  tap water, start immediately

  •  tap water, let the water air out for a day or two

  •  distilled water

Local tap water is chlorinated Great Lakes water."	t5_2rcpo	True
1365786892.0	1c7tk1	Why is my rum so cloudy?	yourhumble_narrator	2	0	1	"I realized I had a ton of sugar, brown sugar, and molasses a few weeks ago and so I threw it all in a bucket, mixed it with clean water and pitched some yeast in. It ended up being a very dark mash with a lot of molasses. Today I distilled it using a home made cheap still and the few drops I tasted felt alright but it came out very cloudy with a bit of sediment in it. It is however, much lighter in color than the mash and very strong. Is there anything that you guys know of that I did wrong? 

I will probably run what I made today through one more time anyways but I am just curious what went wrong.

Thanks"	t5_2rcpo	True
