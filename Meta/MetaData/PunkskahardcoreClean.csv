1309218178.0	iasnk	r/ska and r/punkskahardcore present: Ska tour 2012? (Crosspost from r/ska)		17	1	3	"Sort of a Ska Is Dead tour, but booked, promoted, and played in by Redditors, Redditor's ska bands, Redditor's friends ska bands, etc.
I was thinking about looking into next summer. It's far enough in advance to start planning, and I get the feeling a lot of current ska bands are in college, so school wouldn't be an issue then.

I feel like with all the connections we can make on this sub, we could make a semi-successful little ska tour. Please leave any information about any bands you are in/know of who might be willing to go on tour, venues you have connections with, etc. Anything that could possibly help. If you are serious about helping plan such an event, or would like to help in anyway, PM me. Thanks in advance!

Anyway, you can learn more about University of Reddit by going to http://ureddit.com/ or visiting [our subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/).

Hopefully I don't sound showboaty when I say I'm really proud of this project and how it ended up. I think it'd be really cool to keep growing and see if vigilante colleges band together to shoot my kneecaps.

I think it'd would help to make r/punkskahardcore more accessible, and give both current subscribers and potential subscribers a foundation on which to stand in a vast sea of sick music.

I've talked with the mods briefly about a voting thread, and they seemed pretty receptive to the idea.

Rules: 

- Only one album title per comment. 

- Only upvotes will be counted. 

- top 50 (or so?) will eventually be selected.

Needless to say, Discussion and debate has it's place in this thread also; we're not just looking for album titles.

1354301296.0	142azn	I like ska punk, and I like going to concerts, but so far combining the two kind of scares me	freedomfriends	13	3	24	"My third show ever was last Sunday (Bomb the Music Industry!) and both of the shows I'd been to before that were pretty indie folk losery-tame (The Magnetic Fields at a synagogue the Sunday just before I saw BtMI, where most of the other goers were quiet middle aged people, and of Montreal in April where most everyone were 20something delightfully awkward people)

I'm a 5'5"" relatively small and fairly socially awkward thirteen year old girl, and I went to the show completely alone (As I have with the other shows in the past ((None of my friends like the same music as me and I don't feel like dragging them along anyway)))

I decided it'd be a good idea to come as soon as the doors opened and stand as close as I could to the stage so I could admire Jeff Rosenstock's enthusiasm as closely as possible. And also I think he's kind of cute. I stood there for about an hour, maybe a little more, listening to the loudmouths around me gabbing about the internet and their friends and being drunk. From the time the doors opened to the time BtMI went on, then for about four minutes after that until a mosh pit was started

I'll admit I didn't really think through how I expected the concert to unfold, but I wasn't really expecting someone to ram me into a bunch of other people all of a sudden while I was staring up at the stage. I was kind of scared and uncomfortable while I pushed my way out of the crowd of smashing (literally) people (all of whom were at the very least several inches taller than me) to stand in front of a completely unoccupied area in front of a deafening speaker. I'm not sure if the vibrations from the speaker were causing me to shake or if it was the feeling of crying and throwing up expressing itself in my nervous legs as well, but I felt really silly and looked around for somewhere else to stand. 

My sister always told me to avoid mosh pits when I go to concerts but I didn't even really know ""mosh pit"" meant until I was being knocked around in one

But while I was trying to navigate a route to the back of the room so I could actually hear the band play instead of the ringing in my ears from the incredibly loud speaker, and to escape being near the scary mass of shove-y jumpy people, I saw someone fall down in it. I then saw everyone around him instinctively pull him back up. That made me feel really good. It almost made me want to go back in, just so I could help someone up if I had the chance, and having the reassurance someone would help me up if they had the chance too

I found a place by the wall a little ways back into the room with the rest of the people uninterested in moshing instead. I shouted along to some of my favorite songs, though I couldn't hear myself, and felt good. I didn't even talk to anyone the whole time I was there but I still sort of felt like I liked everyone around me

And that's the end of my long tale about my first punk show. I'll probably hold off trying to get a good view of the stage until I'm a little older, now that I know how that ends.

So yeah. Anything else I should know about punk/ska/general concerts before I attempt to go to another? And am I wrong for thinking Reel Big Fish is going to be more tame because I really have no idea"	t5_2rdin	True

PunkRockMakesMeSmile	10	1	19	It seems to me like punk rock is the perfect soundtrack to growing up in the suburbs. I personally grew up in the middle of the country, was introduced to punk rock initially through the bands who committed the sin of getting radio play, and the spirit of bluntness and sincerity has always seemed relevant and important to me in the midst of a community that was as meticulously standardized as where I came from. Punk rock has had a significant impact on the person I've become, and I'm curious how common it is for people to come to punk rock without any sort of visible presence in their local area to catch their attention to begin with.

I'm writing in order
For someone to explain to my niece the distinction
Between these mandatory pre-game group rites of submission

And the rallies at Nuremburg, specifically the function
The ritual serves in conjunction
With what everybody knows is, in the end, a kid's game
I'm just appealing to your sense of fair play

When I say she's puzzled by
This incessant pressure for her to not defy
Collective will and yellow-ribboned lapels
As the soldiers inexplicably repel

Down from the arena rafters
Which, if not so insane, would be grounds for screaming laughter

Dear Ron MacLean, I wouldn't bother with these questions
If I didn't sense some spiritual connection
We may not be the same but it's not like we're from different planets
We both love this game so much we can hardly fucking stand it

Alberta-born, prairie-raised
Ain't a sheet of ice north of Fargo I ain't played
From Penhold to the Gatineau
Every fond memory of childhood that I know

Is somehow connected to the culture of
This game, I just can't let it go

I guess it comes down to
What kind of world you want to live in
Diversity is disagreement, disagreement is treason
Well, don't be surprised if we find ourselves reaping

A strange and bitter fruit that that sad old man beside you
Keeps feeding to young minds as virtue
It takes a village to raise a child, just a flag to raze the children
Until they're nothing more than ballast for fulfilling

A madman's dream
Of a paradise
Complexity
Reduced to black and white

How do I
Protect her from
This cult of death?"	t5_2rdin	True

(Crosspost from r/punk)		10	0	6	"We're called [Dying Scene](www.dyingscene.com), and we are based in LA, but our team includes citizens of (at least) three countries. We cover punk rock music, and it's subgenres, including celtic/folk punk, ska punk, hardcore, etc.

We post punk stories that range from [fun facts](http://dyingscene.com/news/fun-factoid-friday-tom-gabel-against-me-has-a-talented-wife/) to In addition, we write [album and show reviews,](http://dyingscene.com/news/streetlight-manifesto-somewhere-in-the-between/), [band features,](http://dyingscene.com/news/band-spotlight-the-bastard-suns/) [album](http://dyingscene.com/news/flogging-molly-set-release-date-for-new-album-speed-of-darkness-offer-presale/) and [tour](http://dyingscene.com/news/nofx-teenage-bottlerocket-old-man-markley-announce-canadian-tour-dates/) updates, free music, and much more. We also try to find as many [odd and funny stories](http://dyingscene.com/news/the-dreadnoughts-go-full-monty-onstage-at-least-one-fan-did-not-like-what-she-saw-hilarious/) as we can. 

Our focus is on North American and Australian bands and tours, simply because that's where a large majority of our readers are. But there's still a lot of worthwhile reading material for our international friends.

Our list of contacts in bands has quickly been lengthened, so we get some [great interviews,](http://dyingscene.com/news/ds-exclusive-colin-clive-mustard-plug-talks-1500-shows-and-being-the-most-badass-ska-band-on-the-planet/) too.

I realize that the front page might not always be about bands who might not be considered 'punk' by some people's standards (we cover some pop punk), but our founder/president has a great response to that claim [here.](http://dyingscene.com/dying-scene-faq/#punkrock)

TL;DR Check out this unique punk site to stay updated with the world of punk.

EDIT: If you go to our [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/DyingSceneNews?ref=ts) and 'like' us, our most popular stories will show up on your news feed. It's an easy way to stay updated."	t5_2rdin	True

I was wondering if some of you more current in your involvement could point me towards some newer bands carrying the torch. I enjoyed hardcore more in the punk side than the metal side, IE Carry On, Where Fear and Weapons Meet, Breathe In, Shutdown, Warzone, Bold, Gorilla Biscuits, Sworn In, American Nightmare (gutg, or what have you). Doesn't have to be an extensive list, just some bands to point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance! 	t5_2rdin	True

If shows weren't so rare nowadays I definitely would not have. 

I am guessing the price is due to the fact that the lineup is made up of mostly big metal bands, but its seriously a scam to charge kids 55 bucks for a show regardless. I would have thought that even metal bands had that opinion,  but I guess not. 

I mean when I was living in Philly and went to This is Hardcore fest 4 years in a row it was around 60 bucks for all three days every year without fail. 

Whatever, I am just venting about having to pay a lot of money to only go see 3 bands that I actually care to see (Shipwreck, Bane, and Cruel Hand). 

Anyway, whats the most you guys have had to pay for Hardcore show?"	t5_2rdin	True

Now I have begun to accept that hardcore is fading out, mainly due to the fact that I went to at least 15+ shows when I was 15 and 16 and now only 5 years later I struggling to go to one. It's sad, but I guess I gotta face whats obvious. But what I don't understand is how their isn't some online community which previously used to be there just isn't around anymore. I mean I was never a huge big shot on any forum message boards, but I was a pop in every once in a while kind of person and I always felt like some life was still around.

But now, I just went around the b9 boards and broke out the old soulseek client looking for a ride from Boston to the CB show tomorrow in Worcester (still am looking so if you can help out a fellow redditor please let me know!) and it just feels dead everywhere. Now it's possible I am just not that lucky and nothing is going on recently, but it doesn't feel that way. 

Anybody have an opinion or have some place on the Internets that I missing out on?

It was an amazing show. There's a band that was from NYC, I believe, that went on before GCF. I want to know what that band was. All I remember is that they were fast and aggressive, and female fronted. They had awesome shirts that said the band's name and ""death to jock punk."" i've tried finding old flyers online or an old posting but I can't find anything.

Bullets are fake mind you, and this dude has been wearing this belt since the first day I met him. Here's the articles. Sign the petition if you feel.

Backyard Superheroes is looking for a new singer to, well, replace me. I am more of a backup vocalist than anything and prefer to run around with my guitar than being stuck to a mic.


We have gigs lined up, recording for our 5 song demo already paid for, and practice 1-2 times per week (every saturday from 11am-5pm in Branchburg, every other monday from 9-11pm in sayreville)


Overall it's just a bunch of guys hanging out and having fun. Not in it for money or anything, just like getting on stage and playing. All have experience, no egos (minus the horn section) and plenty of gear to go around.
